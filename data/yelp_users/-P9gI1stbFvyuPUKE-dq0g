This place is THE best place for Italian Deli sandwiches in all of Phoenix (but located in Scottsdale) the bread is incredible! It's definitely an institution! Just GO!

OK, seriously some very good food going on here.  We had a table of five for a corporate dinner and asked our waiter to just "send out what he thought would be best for a small group, family style" and it was spot on. Two rounds of tapas and two larger entrees, with pre chips and salsa and tableside guac.....and ending with the most amazing dessert I've ever had, Pumpkin Bread Pudding. I'll def go back

Haircut was just OK, after telling the barber that I wanted a size "3" clipper and somewhat textured hair on top I ended up with a very short cut, probably more like a "2" (did he use the wrong clipper guard size?) and very super military short on top, no texture at all. It will take 8 weeks to get my hair back to a normal length again. The cut is clean but way too crew cut short, I won't go back again. The barber kept stopping in the middle of my haircut to watch television too, not cool. And so much unswept hair all over the floor. I'm sure there are better barbers who listen to what the customer asks for and who pay attention.

Really great Thai food in Mesa, not all that glamorous inside but the food is really really good. We had Pumpkin Curry (WOW!) and Massaman Curry (WOW again!). Will definitely go back!

Love! Love! Love this place! Where else can you get $4 margaritas and $3 beers EVERYDAY before 6pm? The fajitas are amazing, but we always ask for them a bit more caramelized, cooked just a tad longer, as the sauce gets very rich this way. Best Chimichanga in all of Phoenix and their spicy salsa is seriously the bomb. I go here every time I'm in Phoenix. We don't have Mexican like this in San Francisco. So very good!

For a smaller boutique hotel, total WOW experience. Downtown Phoenix hotels finally have some serious quality competition. The best hotel in downtown Phoenix hands down.

This place is the bomb. Whether you land at Terminal 2 and take the 1 minute train over or if you're already I. Terminal 1, get your Vegas weekend liquor and supplies here! Their prices are same as what you would pay in any big city liquor store. (Absolut for $24.99, most other rums, tequilas and whiskeys same price range.) they have mixers as well as soft drinks, fresh lemons and limes which they will cut for you. Hop in the taxi line right outside and head to your hotel! Easy, cheap and way fast. They must have at least 50 brands of every kind of liquor too, so they will definitely have what you want. I paid $60 for tequila, mix, limes and orange juice. We had two margaritas at Cosmopolitan and the bill was $35 w tip, to give you an idea how much money you'll be saving. I'll definitely come back.
