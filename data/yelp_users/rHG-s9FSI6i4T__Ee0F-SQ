I'll start with the disclaimer that I REALLY like the people that work at this place which is downstairs from my work.  The food is always great quality and if you need a last minute "gift," they have wine and many other goodies to make a  basket (which I have done). The happy hour serves local beers and their house wine is only $3.00 which makes it irresistible for a bargain shopper like me (and it's good too). Stop by and say hello to Ally, Pierce, Gloria and Dave - and rest of the gang.  People are not strangers there for long!

OK, I'll start with a disclaimer, I absolutely adore the people that run this restaurant and have been going to their restaurant since I moved to Phoenix around '91 (two locations ago). However, I have taken countless people to try the food from my native country and EVERYONE has LOVED it.   From my vegetarian to foodie (or chowhound) friends have found something (usually more) that keeps them coming back. Many thank me for having introduce them to this jewel of a restaurant.  My favorite is the Mojarra Frita becaus it brings back memories of growing up in beautiful El Salvador.  I recommend the Especial Combinacion de Eliana's for first time visitors -- it has a Salvadorean tamale wrapped in banana leaf and is moist like a mousse; the tradtional pupusa and a savory turnover called Pasteles ($6).  For a hearty meal, the I recommend the Bistec (beef)  or Pollo (chicken) dishes that come with salad, rice, beans and Salvadorean tortillas ($8.95).. After reading some of the reviews, I just liked to say, thank you for trying out this food but it is not Mexican food.  I can recommend some of those if you msg me

This feels like a neighborhood bistro (much like the ones I have visited in New York).  The food is wonderful and the wine selection varies which I like.  My favorite dishes include:  Salmon, crab crepe, burger and ahi tartar -- but their menu changes often, so don't be surprised if you eat something you like and it's not there next time.

We paid the "twilight rate" of $29 but after 4 holes in two hours, the pro shop said we should be able to play 9. Really?  I'll be supporting a different course come May thru Sept.

Four Peaks has been our "watering hole" for a few years.  The food,  beer and staff are great.  There are several "regulars" that hang out and it really feels like "Cheers" bar.  Most sports bar don't put the level of care into their food, not Four Peaks, their food is fantastic.  If you are a Vikings fan (like me) or a Boston (any sport) you'll feel at home.

I had received a $10 discount coupon in the mail which I didn't have with me but it made me curious because I LOVE Chinese food and it's very close to home.  The weather was nice and their patio looked inviting. I ordered a $11 glass of wine and disappointed that it was barely 1/3 of the glass full. I love Wor Wonton soup, so I ordered the smallest size, again disappointed; the chicken was in such large pieces, it should have been served with a knife; the wonton was the frozen kind that has hardly any meat and mostly wrap; the soup taste was decent as was the one shrimp. The boneless duck tasted good, but I had asked the waiter if it was "crispy" as it's my rule when it comes to duck.  It was not crispy, except for the thick skin, which I don't like, so I had to carefully remove the fat around the meat.  The dish listed vegetables which were so few, at first I thought they would come separately. I will give it another try, but I'll stick to the noodles or fried rice.

We have been St. Francis for dinner and my husband goes there for lunch. But a month ago, we learned about their BRUNCH with live jazz (with long time local favorite Dennis Rowland, a extraordinary pianist/vocalist Rachel Eckroth & fantastic Felix Sainz on bass). However, the live music is only the beginning to a great Sunday brunch.  The food is amazing and we've yet to have something we didn't absolutely love. I recommend the Roasted (4) Baked Eggs, braised beef, vegetables and croutons is my favorite while the smoked salmon poached egg, English muffin, hollandaise sauce is my husband's favorite. I must also say that their crispy potatoes are also very tasty.  Don't ask for the "spicy' Bloody Mary, unless you can take the heat. I prefer their Sweet Mimosa.  Other food suggestions include the two eggs with bacon, the Summer Vegetable frittata and I see many people order the French Onion Burger. PS - Kid friendly menu too!

My friend suggested we celebrate my friend's birthday here.  What a mistake.  The table was akward for 8 people to see each other but hey, we didn't make a reservation. The sad part is that two of us ordered the fajitas (including the birthday gal).  The food arrived and sat next tto our table for well over 5-minutes.  By the time the waitress came to serve our food, it was cold (although we commented on how when the fajitas had first arrived they were not making a sizzling sound).   The waitress appeared upset that we were wanting our food at least worm vs. cold.  She took it to the kitchen and brough back fajitas that had been stuck in the over.  Food was HOT but now way overcooked.  I wont' be returning  to this place anytime soon -- with some many other great choices, i'm sorry my friedn chose this restaurant.

Again, there for Yelp Restaurant week, just a little lazy about writing a review. This time I was with my buds Janell & Lydia -- we started out at the bar where Janell and I tried their specialty drinks (think they are called Shochu) -- these were light and refreshing, but don't get me wrong, they pack a punch. We had their butter fish appetizers and that's when I knew I'd bring my hubby here for dinner. The tasting menu was good but when I returned for my birthday, I got to try some other dishes and really liked them (particularly the ribs). We'll definitely be back!

My hubby, a friend and I went there for Yelp Restaurant Week (I'm just a procrastinator) for dinner.  I had been there for lunch which I really enjoyed, but the dinner was delicious. We each had something different on the tasting menu so we got to try many dishes at once.  The drinks were sooooo good and the desserts were to die for.  OK, we'll be going back and making The Mission a household favorite.

I'm so lucky that I work across from Desert Ridge.  The pizza selection is the best; their sirloin/chicken chili is the best as is their salads (I'm not a big salad eater).  Great bar service and daily specials.

My friend Nancy and I decided to try a place neither one of us had been to, and she recommended Petit Maison.  It is a lovely place, just east of Scottsdale Rd. on Shoeman. We arrived at 1 p.m., so we missed the lunch crowd and opted to sit outside in the shade to enjoy our 70's degree weather. Instead of ordering wine by the glass, we decided to order a bottle of a nice French Pinot Noir (reasonable for $40).  Nancy ordered the daily fish special, which was a pan seared dover sole, while the waiter recommended I combine the smoked salmon with the vegetarian sandwich.  Both were delicious. However, the most pleasant surprise was dessert (which I hardly ordered).  We ordered the beignets (sp?) with chocolate sauce: WOW.  They were freshly prepared and the chocolate sauce was fantastic.  I'll definitely be back. NOTE:  Parking is available on the street and next door lot, but there is not clear sign.

My husband and I visited this restaurant for the first time this week.  Randy L. will be glad to know they now have music and even a live act on Saturday night. They have wine flights (which I enjoyed one the white selection) and their wine prices are reasonable and their list is very interesting. My husband had the poached Halibut which was very tasty while I ordered the Napa Nicoise Salad.  I really liked my salad, the seared ahi was perfectly cooked and very good quality. My only complaint was the service.  Our waiter was not very friendly while the owner made sure to stop by our table and asked about our food.  It's pet peeve when a waiter asks if you will have dessert, you say no, and he brings the check.  Dude, how did you know we weren't going to order more wine (make the tab higher and therefore,  tip you more).   We'll be back again but hopefully won't get the same waiter.

This is one of my favorite Fox restaurants.  The food is fresh and quality is high.  It satisfies both my vegetarian and meat eating friends.  We always sit at the bar (although sometimes it's packed) because the bartenders are probably the best in town. I recommend the steak tacos and kale salad.

Finally, a fun place with great food in our Grayhawk neighborhood.  The Chef is Italian and the owner (German) is friendly and always there.  Ever since my husband and I found this place, we've become regulars, eating there twice to three times a week.  My favorites are the two fresh pastas, but also tried one of their pizzas which is amazing.  The Mac & Cheese is also among the best in the valley. My husband really likes the pork chop and I would also recommend their salmon.  They have several pastas, but my favorite is the fresh mushroom (I have them add chicken) in a creamy sauce. The bartenders (Ryan & Natalie) are friendly and efficient.   In a short 6 weeks, this place has managed a good crowd and there was a bit of wait (which I don't mind for good food) on Friday night.  Boy, I guess we'll have to start making reservations. Last but not least, it is reasonably priced -- check out their Saturday/Sunday drink specials ;)

My friend Vickie was visiting from Denver and I wanted to go some place new for breakfast after our 8 a.m. massage on Black Friday.  I had read about La Petite France and thought it sounded good. It is tucked inside the Seville shopping center, so you have to park and find your way inside.  Very nice patio but it was a bit too cold to sit outside. We ordered  the $12 breakfast which includes coffee, juice or fruit, french bread and choice of omelet (with a croissant) + small salad.  I'm not sure if it's included but we had gotten a croissant, so we each ended up with two.  I chose the ham/bacon omelet & fruit (I'll post pictures) and my friend chose the OJ with the vegetarian omelet.  They accommodated her choice of cheese and egg whites. The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 star is that they do not serve champagne by the glass.  If they could figure out that people enjoy a glass or two of champagne with their breakfast on weekends or days off, they would make many happy and more $$ for them. Having traveled to France, I see why others posted about  the service.  This is a traditional French Bistro (with slow service) and authentic French servers.  So if you are willing to wait (or have to call your server vs. waiting), then I think you will definitely enjoy the food.

I had the chance to enjoy lunch at the bar. Manny, the bartender is very friendly and attentive. I ordered the ceviche which turned out to be too spicy for me (yes, I'm a wimp when it comes to spice) and he had the manager comp my wine. What a sweet gesture. I'll be back for their On The Block buttermilk fried chicken which is only served after 4 pm. Their happy hour rocks!

I too went to JanMichael for a Brazilian blowout but he has quickly become my hair stylist extraordinaire!  He has been very flexible with my hectic schedule and he always does a great job.

It is not the menu or the food, but the service that may be downfall at this new neighborhood place.  We sat at the bar (which is usual for us) and the bartenders were more interested in chating with friends than to make sure we were happy with our meal. We were going to order dessert but as soon as the plates were taken, the bartender presented us with the tab.  Too bad, we walked over to Local Bistro and had dessert there.  May come back but with some many other good places that have opened up lately (Soul Cafe, Isabella's, etc.), it might be a while before we return.

A few years ago, we traveled to Belgium to visit our neighbors.  There was the most awesome chocolate shop nearby by a man named Marcolini.  Turns out that Chocolade van Brugge fulfill the expectation of true Belgian chocolate the chocolatier studies under Marcolini. My first trip was to buy a birthday gift and a box to share with my girlfriends.  All raved about the taste and I particularly like the way the various flavors come through each bite. I'm so happy to have this store in our city and will be a loyal customer.

We used to go to their old location but loving the new digs. Busy on a Wednesday night and so happy to see it doing so well. Staff is friendly and service oriented. The food is fantastic. Tonight we stared with the cheese board and that was followed by Pasta Bolognese and Veggie Gnocchi.  This place is a wonderful addition to the the area. Say hello to JASON the manager and Lynn the bartender.
