Had a really good pastrami sandwich. The meat is flavorful, the prep time for the sandwich was quick since I went around 9:30 and there was only one person in line. I crave this deli shops sandwich and will definitely be back.

I'm surprised at how affordable and tasty the only place to eat at the top of the stratosphere tower is. It was a good lunch for a reasonable price.

The service was bad. The wifi didn't work in our room (346) for both nights we stayed and the managers said that it was my computer that didn't work. I came to the lobby to use the wifi, my computer worked well in the lobby.   It was free to use the printer.   They have coffee machines, fridge, microwave, showers.   The sleep number bed did not adjust and had trouble working. One of the beds had hair in it.   The air conditioner had two settings - high and low.   The continental breakfast was tasty.   I will not come back because of the service and give them 1 star because I had to come to the lobby to use the internet both nights. They failed to fix the problem both nights we were there.

Excellent. The store looks like a small hole in the wall when you come in. The inside is very nice and clean. The bathrooms are clean.   The menu is on the wall which is neat. It is also on a pamphlet.  After ordering I asked for chips and water. The owner brought out a BIG pitcher of ice cold water with ice in it. The salsa he brought out was delicious...and SPICY. The chips were fresh, home made and very crispy. I have not had chips this good in my life.   The burrito came out shortly after the chips. The burrito was stuffed with meat. The burrito had beans in it also. There is also cheese in the burrito. It was very satisfying. It was even more delicious!! And it was super filling!  I am very happy I chose this establishment and want to come back soon!  Thanks for reading
