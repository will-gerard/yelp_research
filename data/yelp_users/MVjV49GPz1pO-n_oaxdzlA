Saved my bacon! The wife and I locked the keys in the running at the Shell station next door. Scott walked over and popped the locks and didn't charge me! We take all of our fleet vehicles here, as our warehouse is a mile away. The new crew is a great group, give them a shot.

Excellent pizza. Real Italian sausage! Made specifically for this resteraunt.  Also the honey hot wings are fantastic if your into the bastardization of the original buffalo wing.

I decided to break from routine and get a haircut at a local Great Clips. I called ahead and asked if they had an experienced barber that could do a flat top. The lady assured me that they did. I was Leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like Madonna. Half way through this butchering, she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut. Kid you not, it was an inch longer at the sides than the center. I looked like a cross between the Gunny and flock of seagulls. I went home, set the clippers on 3 and finished the job......Would not go back here unless I lost a bet.

I'm a big fan of Sliders and used to love them here. My wife and I went to Teakwoods for lunch yesterday, I ordered my usual cheeseburger sliders and my wife ordered meatloaf sliders. The buns were hard, dry and terrible tasting. I asked the waitress what the deal was, she stated that they changed to a cheaper product to save money. Well, you get what you pay for. I wont be back unless they change back to a quality product. Now if I want a good burger I have to drive all the way into Awhatukee to 5 guys!

Excellent, excellent, excellent! Seems strange to me to have to search for a good hamburger yet this is what where reduced to. Went to 5 Guys today (first time) on the way back from a hike in Tonto Ntl Forrest. It was just like back home (Michigan) when I was a kid and good burgers were plentiful! Reasonably priced, very fresh and fast. Johnny Rocket, In N' out ish but better quality meat. Delicious.
