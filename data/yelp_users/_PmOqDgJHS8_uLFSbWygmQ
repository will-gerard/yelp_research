Read the reviews, had high hopes. Ordered 2 fish tacos. Not bad, but not good enough for me to seek them out again. The tortillas were really good! Also had an order of jalape√±o poppers, not worth the $6 I paid for them. Didn't even finish them. They were hard and again just nothing special. Probably won't go back here, but I love Mexican so I can't say never! Lol. Just wasn't impressed at all and was wondering why it was so highly rated.

Second time here. The first time, they had no cold beer for the michelada I ordered, the girl had to come back 3 times before she could get it right with a cold beer. The second time they got our order wrong. Asked for eggs over easy with chorizo, she came with scrambled eggs and chorizo. We sent it back and she brought the same exact thing. They had it on the menu with over easy eggs. However the servers don't understand what over easy means. The food is "ok", but when I ordered a street taco it was way over priced for the size and quality. Not recommending or going back here again.

Love char! Good pizza, good service. The west valley doesn't get much "outside of the box" type places. Char is one of them. Prices are great as well!
