I've been to this McDonald's twice, one month apart, and I've had the same experience twice.  The hash browns are gross. They taste like they've been fried in old, burned, rotted oil. This is the only McDonald's I've ever been to that's had foul tasting hash browns.  Both times I've sat inside and both times I've overheard the same bitching several times over... .the manager having to continually tell a male employee (not kidding around), "stop being mean to the customers" and "be nice!"

UH-OHHH I HAVE A BAD BAD FEELING THIS ONE IS CLOSED TOO!!  We always come here, often once a week and the food and service is excellent. We always come around 11am to 3pm and it seems those Yelpers who've had a bad experience go later into the evening.  I was looking on the TGI Fridays official website for the address to the Happy Valley location and noticed  this one on Tatum is no longer listed. Very bad sign. I called their number and get the phone company creepy dee-dee-deeeee tone with the automated message that the phone number is no  longer in service. But I was just there, how could this be??!!  Actually I'm not surprised. I always went to the Friday's on Bell Rd and was shocked when I was there one week and the next week it was suddenly closed totally out of the blue. It was always packed, even during the day, so it made no sense. I mentioned this to the server at Tatum and she said it wasn't because the Bell Rd location wasn't successful, it was because the owner couldn't pay the rent any longer at that location nor at 2 other locations. And he'd done the employees dirty as well. The employees had no clue. One day the owner had them all moving their restaurant equipment to other locations, including the Tatum one. She said the employees were all chattering happily because they were sure it meant they were getting all new stuff. Then after everything was moved the owner tells them the bad news.  She said the owner owns this Tatum location and the Happy Valley one as well, but they had no worries, the same couldn't happen to them, because the property was owned not rented at both locations. I remember thinking, "Great, if he is that lowdown a jerk to pull what he did at the other locations, what would stop him from just selling this location at no notice to the employees." I have a sad feeling that's exactly what happened.  So, it looks like only the Happy Valley and downtown Phoenix locations remain. She said the guy owns the Happy Valley place so I doubt that will be around much longer. Don't know if he operates the downtown one as well...hope not.  R.I.P. Fridays...your cheese-sticks are the best, the grocery store version is gross, but the ones at  your restaurants are mm-mmm-MMMM!

I went because several people I know raved about the place, because I'm a lapsed vegetarian and I'm always trying to get back on track and heard the veggie sandwiches were incredible, and because I'm a malt freak and found out they have malteds there.  I was disappointed. And my friend I was with who had been one of Stickler's die-hard fans said that, although it was okay this time, the place seems to have gone down hill.  Stickler's wasn't busy at all, maybe 4 tables of customers and 3 people in line, but although there were alot of workers behind the counter, the service was very slow. We had to wait a long time for our veggie sandwiches. Now my friend has been there when it was jam-packed and she said the service then was much quicker. We went about 2 so maybe the staff was worn out from the lunch rush earlier.  The bread was good, crunchy on the outside and soft inside but the vegetarian sandwich itself was boring. It's supposed to have Swiss, Provolone and American cheese on it. I couldn't even taste the Swiss or Provolone at all, the American over powered the sandwich and was more like a cheez-whiz type.  I'm always on the look out for a good malt, one that really tastes like a malt and not a shake. My chocolate malt tasted more like a shake and I wasn't impressed with the ice cream. My buddy liked her vanilla malt though.  The one thing I did like about Stickler's is that they have the small bags of Miss Vickie's chips to buy. It used to be you could buy big bags in the grocery stores but now the chips,which are the best kettle chips I've ever had, are just carried in certain deli and sandwich shops.

This location is closing and from Friday 5-16-2014 until the next Wednesday, the restaurant is auctioning off everything to the general public...the arrowheads, Indian Head nickles, wood burning stoves and even the bar. I think I might head up there and see if I can snag anything.  I have mixed feelings about this location closing. I never like the food here at all. I thought the steaks were bleh and their fried zucchini (which I always like elsewhere) was gross as well. The only thing I liked (which I never like any place else) were the potato skins.  Even though I sort of hated it, any friend or relative who came to town always wanted to go there. It must be featured in some guide books. They were always excited and enjoyed the food. Maybe it was just me or maybe they were so hyped up about being in someplace similar to what they thought the wild west should be, they overlooked the dull food.  I wonder if the closing had to do with the deceased person who was found in the chuck wagon out front last year. I don't think it made the news (don't know why), but I was at the Walmart across the street when people came running from the restaurant screaming (for no reason) and when the coroner pulled up..   Well, I hate to see you go Bill Johnson's, I may not have liked your food, but you sure were a great way to entertain and appease visitors from out of state and make me come across as a cool host..

**Be sure to check your order before you leave this McDonald's. It's always missing some food item.**  This has happened to me 6 different times over the past 4 months. Why didn't I learn my lesson after the first time? It's not something you normally think about when you're in the drive thru, that "Oh yeah this is the one that ALWAYS leaves something out!" Plus, I've had other family members go get my order and forgot to warn them. It won't happen again because I'll never go back or send anyone else there.  When I call the manager , he's always apologetic and says he'll replace the missing item but that's always a big inconvenience. Who wants to drive all the way back?  The only reason I gave it two stars is because it's the only McDonald's up in North Phoenix that has the game pieces throughout the entire Monopoly Game season. Other McDonald's run out the first few days or the first week. I guess this is the only McDonald's that doesn't let employees pilfer the pieces.

Just to clarify, this location in Anthem is not in the Shell gas station it's in the Fry's shopping center. Roger used to own the Roberto's at the gas station on 7th Avenue and Union Hills in Phoenix and that is when he appeared the first time on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives. He was also featured in a special Guy Fieri did about his favorite restaurants and I think that was filmed at this new location. Roger sold the gas station Roberto's.  I think many of the poor reviews are from people who are still going to the gas station location thinking Roger and Maria still operate it.  This new location is quite a drive for me but when we're on our way to or from Sedona we try to stop by.  Roger will go out of his way to make sure you are happy with your meal. When my Mom was disappointed that her chile rellenos were too hot Roger said just to call him in the morning before we came and he'd prepare some where he'd take out all the seeds.  If you happen to be in the Anthem area this is definitely the place to stop.

This place has been renamed to Crazy Earl's. The only item on the menu still good is the Mexican pizza. All the rest of the menu is identical to what it's always been BUT they've started using bad quality meat, like what the jail would serve if it even serves meat to the inmates.

This has now changed ownership and is a JULIOBERTO'S. It  has been for about 6 months.   You might not have guessed it by looking at the drive-thru menu board because it's the same (as is the phone number) and the sign almost looks the same BUT you can tell a big BIG difference in the taste of food.  I've heard all the stories about all the different  "-berto" restaurants being owned by relatives from the same family. I don't know if that's true or not. It would seem that way because all the menus are almost identical. I do know that even if it is true the various "-bertos chains" all seem to have their unique recipes which are consistent within their group. For example, I can go to an Eriberto's in one end of town and the hot sauce tastes the same as another Eriberto's located elsewhere but the sauce is totally different from what's served at Humbertos. This particular Filiberto's (when it was a Filiberto's) was the best of all the "Berto's" and the best within all the Filibertos...maybe the ingredients were fresher or the cooks took special care to make sure everything was cooked perfectly but whatever it was led me to drive passed 2 other Filiberto's closer to my home just to go to this one.  Now it's gone and it's pointless to make the longer drive because the food is just not good anymore now that it's a Julioberto's. This Berto's will be missed.

Criss Angel must have some magical ability , there's no other explanation for him to still be headlining on the Strip, His show is so horrible that Luxor should have kicked him to the curb a long time ago. And since they did not I can only assume he used some form of mind control on the management.  There are no quality illusions whatsoever. When Criss is supposed to be descending from the top of the stage along the curtain you can tell he's attached to some mechanism that is lowering him. When the ribbon "magically" becomes a dove you can see Criss' tall lanky male assistant stage left removing a live bird from his big overcoat. When Criss tosses the balls to the supposedly random people in the audience then proceeds to read their minds you can tell not only that they are plants but so are all those surrounding the plant for several rows. That way it ensures if Criss' throw is off he doesn't have to deal with a real person. I say this because before the show I saw the girl who was "randomly selected"  and a person who turned up several rows behind her talking to one of the crew.  The only entertaining bit, and the only reason we bothered staying for the show's entirety, is Criss' sidekick Maestro. Now that guy is hilarious and should really get his own show. Criss is stifling his act.

I'm accustomed to the Scottsdale bar scene. I know it can be loud and rowdy and I don't mean that in a bad way. But the crowd at The Lodge though just seems to go too far, like they should have been cut off many alcoholic beverages ago but weren't. This seems to be the case particularly for the patio hang-out. You know the expression "falling down drunk", well I spotted several of those within 15 minutes. And they took the tables with them. Yet the the staff ignores it while the other patrons laugh and applaud.  And I wouldn't recommend going on a Saturday night if you plan to eat in the dining room. You'll have trouble finding a table if you have more than 2 in your party. Now you might think I should've known better than to go with a group on what will always be a busy weekend night there but I was told when I called ahead that "sure no problem we can fit 8 in". The phone-answerer never offered to make a reservation, I got the impression The Lodge doesn't take them, but if it does he seemed to think one wasn't necessary.  Then we get there and are told there's no space in the dining room and they have no idea when there will be.  The staff is friendly and that's the only reason this place even deserves one star. They may be a bit too nice. Their being lenient and easy going is one of the reasons the drunks get out of hand.

A) 4 stars if you go on Thursday at 5pm when the park is open until 10pm B) 3 stars if you go on Friday or Saturday at 5pm when the park is open until 10pm C) 2 stars for employees D) 2 stars for food E) 1 star for customer service F) 1 star for birthday parties   A & B) The best time to go, when you'll only have to wait 10 minutes or so at the slides, is on a Thursday night at 5pm. It's still light until about 8:00pm and it's warm until the park closes.  Any other time you'll have to wait 30 minutes to over an hour for a good slide ride. Even though they have coverings and misters along most of the stairwells, there are expanses when you are exposed to the sun with no covering or misters in slow-moving lines.  Wet N Wild's operating schedule isn't good either. Starting on August 16th the park isn't even open during the week.  C) I've encountered some pleasant and helpful employees but they are the exception. Many are rude and oblivious to customers.  D) The food is just okay and over-priced. You can tell the hot food is cooked ahead of time and kept in warmers. A slice of just okay tasting lukewarm pizza is $4.00 and a large coke (the size of a medium) is $3.75. A skimpy Caesar salad is $9.00  E) If you have a problem go immediately to Guest Relations and insist on speaking to a manager. Otherwise you will never get help. The red-shirt employees (who claim to have no authority) will just direct you to blue-shirt employees who are supposedly in a supervisory capacity. Their response is they will "tell someone to take care of it" but nothing is done. Do not wait until you exit the park and assume you can call or use the contact form on their website, no one ever responds to either. When you call you have a series of automated choices; if you leave a message no one will call back. A hint is although the phone recording never says 0 is an option to push, you will get a live person if you do.  F) I would say do not, under any circumstances, book one of their birthday party packages. The designated area is rather isolated, not near lockers, and unless you have someone who is willing to sit there the entire time, a very easy place for anyone to pick up a gift and take off with it. You are supposed to show your birthday or group pass to go through the entrance path with an employee posted but the whole area is open and I saw numerous people come and go from the sides.  The food is set up buffet style for all birthday parties that are happening that day. All parties are scheduled from 11am to "close" (but that's always 5pm even if the park closes at 10pm)  with the food available until 2pm. The day we went there were 8 other parties. You get in a line at the buffet and the food could run out before you get to it. The food is brought out from a building where it's originally heated up, then put inside lidded metal pans. The macaroni and cheese was sticky and cold. The hot dogs were barely warm. The buns were cold. There is also a small basket or two with bags of chips and those go quickly. The cupcakes are brought out after 2pm and left to sit on the tables, by then everyone has headed to the attractions.  The worse set up, which initially sounds like the best, is for the drinks. You get "free endless" drinks from 2 soda dispensers in a separate building. That building also accommodates any booked groups. The day we had our party, the line for the group people was 20 minutes long. When questioned what to do, the manager (who disappeared soon after 11am), 3 red-shirt employees, and 1 blue-shirt employee all told us birthday people didn't have to wait in the drink line and to come in the opposite door and cut the line. Sure it's easy to say that when you aren't the one confronted with irritated hot people who have stood in line forever waiting for drinks. I did as the manager and employees said and cut. You wouldn't believe the dirty looks and foul comments. Most people from my party and the 8 other birthdays opted to go purchase their own drinks from a concession stand rather than cut line. Even if you want to cut it's difficult to get in there to even get cups. An employee should be inside the building at all times and direct the birthday people to the drink dispensers. The employees said they had a group of 1500 that day and it wasn't usually bad. But I went to a different party weeks later and the same thing was going on. Employees say "if you have any problem just tell them we said to do it". Uh, is that after you get a drink thrown in your face? Also the drinks are to be available "all day" (which is 5pm even when the park closes at 10pm) but the dispensers had run out of drinks at 3:30pm and the next time at 3pm. Both times we were told by employees they would tell someone to take care of it which turned out to mean the building was locked up and no soda was available again.

I noticed that Sherri J mentioned the setup looked like it was from the 70s and she's correct. I saw photos of my parents sitting in a booth there in 1979 and the furniture and decor was identical to what it is now.  The restaurant was originally called just Earl's. I think they added the "Crazy" to it in recent years to hopefully drum up business. The food quality has gone steadily down hill the past 8 years. I used to come here as kid when I visited my grandparents in Sun City. It its heyday you'd have to wait for an hour for a table. The good was delicious especially the Mexican pizza. It was the best Mexican pizza I've ever had anywhere.  The original location was down the street and around the corner in the northeast corner of the strip mall on 99th Ave and Peoria. In the early 2000s it moved to the current spot and immediately the meat used in all the dishes got horrible, like they started using low quality institutional stuff to save money. The Mexican pizza, which uses ground beef, remained the same so I guess it was cheap enough not to substitute with junk meat. But we noticed as the years passed the parking lot got less and less full as did the dining room.  We used to drive 40 miles to come here up until a few years ago. It was worth it if we just intended to have the Mexican pizza which used to be only $4.99 for a 12 inch then went up to close to $8 but was so delicious it didn't matter. After a while not everyone wanted just the pizza and everything else on the menu was so god-awful we just stopped coming.

Roger and Maria, who were featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, no longer own this place.  I was surprised to see it was still open. When we used to go in over a year ago, Roger said he was going to close it and open a new restaurant in Anthem (which he did). But I didn't realize that this original Roberto's would keep the name and stay open under new ownership so there began the confusion. I thought Roger had two locations (which I found out later he does not).  I had found a coupon in the SavvyShopper circular for 20% off and that's how I learned this gas station Roberto's was still in operation. So we went. The menu was the same but the food didn't taste the same.  Then I got home and realized I'd been overcharged and was not given a receipt. It made me uncomfortable when I read V.W.'s post that the same thing had happened to them. I don't like that sort of "carelessness".  Because I thought Roger still owned this restaurant, I just assumed that this gas station 7th Ave and Union Hills website address would be the same as the new Roberto's in Anthem robertosaz.com but then I saw where Laura R. mentioned that the gas station location isn't even listed on their website. The SavvyShopper showed the website address for 7th Ave and Union Hills Roberto's as being different robertosphoenix.com (which I added to this business listing). I knew then something wasn't right because if Roger still owned both certainly he'd have just one website with both physical addresses listed.  When you go to the gas station's site  robertosphoenix.com you kind of get the impression it's still owned by Roger and Maria though, it's confusing. The "About Us" section says "We have been providing our clients with the most authentic Mexican dishes for years." and there's a "Food Network" section that says "We are honored to have been featured on the FOOD NETWORK's show: "Dives, Diners & Drive-ins" starring Guy Fieri. Please click here to watch the show right now!" which links to a YouTube of the original show Roger and Maria were on (of course any site can link to any YouTube page). But no where on the whole website are Roger and Maria's names mentioned.  So I figured the best thing to do was just call the Anthem location to clarify the whole mess. When I did I was told Roger and Maria no longer owned the gas station location.  I found a post from Carina M. under the Roberto's Anthem location which might explain why the Roberto's gas station location can still make the claim to have been on DDD even though Roger and Maria no longer own it. It's because Roberto's is actually a chain out of Las Vegas and San Diego. That would explain quite a bit including the same menus.  Even with the identical menus it definitely depends on who is doing the cooking though. This gas station location is just not as good. Some dishes aren't bad like the carne asada plate, the chopped meat is flavorful and not greasy yet I was surprised to see it wasn't a whole grilled piece of steak. The beef taco shell is a tasty crispy fried white flour tortilla that looks like an empanada. But the cheese enchiladas are greasy and their sauce has an odd cinnamon taste. A touch of cinnamon might make the sauce interesting but this tasted like the cook poured the whole bottle in.  They are open on Sundays which the "old" Roberto's was not and they do have a coupon page on their website. I'm not going back though even with a coupon because the being charged incorrectly situation just doesn't set well with me.

We wandered in because we thought this new location at the Norterra Shopping Center was open to the public, there were lots of cars and people going in and out. It turned out to be Friends and Family Day and this Buffalo Wild Wings wasn't officially opening until a few days later. We turned to leave but they told us to come on in and make ourselves at home which was a pleasant surprise.   There was alot of hustle and bustle going on and confusion (some friends and family can be pretty demanding) and I think some of the new servers were nervous but everyone was in a good mood, happy and the service was above and beyond what is usual at some places and quite efficient.   There was lots on the menu to choose from besides wings and the kids menu was extensive. We ordered a Black and Bleu burger, a grilled chicken sandwich, cheeseburger slammers, a Boca Burger, and of course, the wings.  There were so many wing sauces to choose from.and we decided to try the Caribbean Jerk sauce.   Everyone was satisfied with their food and we all tried each others (even me and I got the Boca Burger...I'm a can't-resist-the-temptation-of meat vegetarian). Often Boca burgers served at restaurants aren't very tasty even though they're all the same brand. I don't know what Buffalo Wild Wings does to theirs but it had a goof flavor and not that cardboard texture. The Black and Bleu burger had an interesting flavorful combination of bleu cheese and Cajun spices and the cheeseburger sliders were yummy. I've gotten in the habit at restaurants of testing out the burgers without all the condiments to see if the meat actually has a good taste. I've been so disappointed at several restaurants lately where the burgers are laden with extras but if you push those away and actually take a bite of the meat alone it's dull and flavorless. This is not the case at Buffalo Wild Wings, the beef is seasoned to perfection.   The chicken sandwich was juicy and had a good flavor. We really enjoyed the wings as well. I hate soggy wings and these were nice and crispy. The sauce was definitely tasty and not too sweet or spicy as some Jerk seasonings can be.  I was surprised that the french fries tasted just like McDonald's which is a good thing if you love them. I guess I was just expecting the fries to be different.   At the end of the meal we asked for the check and were told no check it was all on the house which was a pleasant and unexpected shock. We will definitely be back.

This used to be a Filiberto's for many years. About 6 months ago I noticed the food tasted different, not as good. I thought there must be a new chef and was hoping maybe he was just a fill-in for awhile. I kept coming back and being disappointed. I know you must think what an idiot for punishment I was but it had been so great for so many years I couldn't believe that the place would really become permanently bad.   I always go through the drive-thru and I finally got so irritated with my food when I got it home I looked on the bag for the phone number. I wanted to call and ask why they changed their recipes. Then I saw the bag said "Julioberto's" not Filiberto's. The menu board outside never changed (neither did the phone number actually) and I just never noticed the different sign (the two look amazing alike).  I know the urban myth is that all the "berto" restaurants (Filiberto's, Julioberto's, Eriberto's, Humberto's) are run by the same family and the menus are identical. Maybe that's true but that would be where it ends. The menu items may be the same but the recipes are different.  As for the difference I don't think the quality of the ingredients is as good and the portions are much smaller. I always get the chili rellenos platter and a cheese quesadilla. The chili rellenos fried batter is too thick and and the poblano peppers are much smaller than they were. There isn't as much cheese put inside the pepper and that cheese doesn't taste as good. There is too much sauce and the meal overall seems to lack in seasoning. They are skimpy with the sour cream and lettuce, which doesn't taste fresh. The pico de gallo is tasteless and also doesn't seem fresh.The refried beans that come along with the meal don't have much taste and are runny. The cheese quesadilla is way smaller than it was, about half the size, and it also seems, and may be, microwaved. There isn't as much cheese and it isn't as tasty as before.  I came yet back again with a friend. Her request and she was buying so why not. She wanted to see if the food really tasted that different. She said her Super Nachos weren't the same from when the place was a Filiberto's but she actually liked them better. I asked her why and she said that it had more sauce and a tastier sauce. I myself don't care for nachos with any sauce and wasn't aware it should have sauce. She said they also were more generous with the sour cream and pico de gallo than before.  Oh well to each his own. This Julioberto's isn't that bad, it just is when compared to when it was a Filiberto's with an identical menu.
