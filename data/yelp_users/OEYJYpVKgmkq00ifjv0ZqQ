It's really a pain to go to this Sonic. The service is horrible. They just have the idc attitude. Such a shame.

I've gone here a few times.  The staff is awesome and the atmosphere is great.  My nails in other words, SUCKED.  Sadly, I won't be returning due to how my gel nail color started peeling off within ONE week. Waste of $.

We've been coming here for years.  Management and the team used to be SO much better.  Over the past few years it's gone to crap.  The hostesses act like they are too good to seat you.  The servers act careless and hate their job.  Sometimes we get a great server. I wish they'd pick up their act.  Something always goes wrong when we come here. Great memories from here. Pick up your act guys!

Stephanie has been doing my hair for 8+ years! She's become my friend, not just my hair lady. She is passionate and knows what she is doing.
