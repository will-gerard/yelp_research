Overall nice place to take the kids in the West Valley. I agree with other reviews that the animals don't have much room but that's the case at pretty much every zoo. Large facility and undergoing expansion right now so make sure you allow a full day to see things.  I highly recommend arriving right when they open so you can see everything you want and avoid a lot of the crowds.  You *are* allowed to bring food and drinks so feel free to do so (especially snacks for the kids and water). Another money saving tip: check the Hick land Farms egg cartons,  they often have coupons inside for "buy one get one."  (Just open the top and look to see next time you are shopping and thinking about a trip to the zoo soon).

Pizza was not very good.  Our toddler didn't even like it.   The play area was smaller than other PPP/Chuck E Cheese locations.  And of course the games are like the others,  not that great and give few tickets.  Ticket prizes are cheap, as usual.. 4 tokens for a dollar and you will likely end up getting say 20 tickets max for that, then the prizes that are like 200 points or less can be purchased at dollar stores or in bulk cheap (e.g. lollipops or army men). Spent $37 for a large pepperoni pizza (about $12), large soda (about it 2.50), and 100 tokens ($20).   Giving it two stars because at least the kids had fun.. but I can't help but think we could have got a better pizza at the same price (or cheaper from the big pizza chains) and spent the token money elsewhere.

Whoever doesn't think QT is the best gas station / convenience store out there probably hates puppies.   Top tier gas,  clean bathrooms, good prices on drinks, etc.  I almost exclusively go to QT.  (Just wish they had some in Surprise and outside the Phoenix metro area when I'm traveling for work).

Great Mexican food.  I often get the beef burrito combo or the mini chimis.  I love the beans and cheese and rice that comes with the combos,  I mix them together and I swear I could make a meal of just that it's my favorite part.   Don't forget to get the horchata as your drink, delicious!

We've tried them a few times because we want to support local businesses but we are just never impressed with the food.

I've used this cleaners numerous times and I feel like they aren't even cleaning the items.  Even when I point out a minor spot (like a deodorant mark, not some stubborn stain mind you) it's still there when I get the item back.   I don't know why I kept going back, convenience and reasonable cost I guess.. but I do not recommend them.

Overall good restaurant.  Pretty low prices (e.g. 9.75 or something like that for a pulled pork sandwich) considering you are at the zoo and you can choose to sit inside by the shark/ray tank, in the bar by an albino alligator, or on the patio by the flamingos. Their "sweet heat" sauce is awesome. Note: You do *not* need to pay for or visit the zoo/aquarium to visit this restaurant.. you can access the restaurant either directly from exterior or from within the aquarium section of the Wildlife World Zoo.

Whoever doesn't think QT is the best gas station / convenience store out there probably hates freedom.  Top tier gas,  clean bathrooms, good prices on drinks, etc.  I almost exclusively go to QT.  (Just wish they had some in Surprise and outside the Phoenix metro area when I'm traveling for work).

Good burgers, but I feel they overcook them often. Delicious fries, get the fry sauce - that's good too.  I picked up some of their special seasoning to add to my own fries and burgers at home.   Wish the prices were a little lower.
