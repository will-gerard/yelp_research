I really enjoy That's A Wrap! I want to use an exclamation point, because I feel like they do too! I'm a sucker for kitsch so I love the names of their wraps such as the Veggie Jackson & the Ken and Barbie-Q. I like the interior-- it seemed clean with very interesting artwork and lots of local business/event paraphernalia which I always appreciate seeing around town. I had the Prince of Thai's on a recommendation from the guy at the counter & I thought it was quite tasty as was the pasta salad. Maybe a little too much rice. The service was really quick, I ordered my wrap to go and I had barely sat down and someone from the back had brought it out to me all packed to go with a nice little "That's A Wrap" sticker, and I was out the door.  The wraps are $7.25 with a side of either chips & salsa, pasta, or fruit. Together it makes for a filling meal without being stuffed. I will definitely be back there were many items on the menu that spurred my interest plus it is right down the street from my house.

I walked into Apple this last weekend with my MacBook clutched to my body in fear and worry. What began the night before as a ominous, frightening clicking inside of my laptop, progressed the next morning into nothing but a flashing folder with a question mark on it.   I was greeted instantly and was cheerily asked what I had come into the store for. I frantically explained what was going on with my MacBook, and I could tell by the fallen face of the greeter that my inclinations were unfortunately right on the money. He set up an appointment for me with a Genius for 30 minutes in the future- during which time I finally got around to looking at those pesky external hard drives! (Too little too late I fear)  I came back and only had to wait a few minutes to be helped by my assigned Genius. My story garnered the same reaction as the concierge, and all was confirmed when Genius couldn't even detect the existence of my hard drive. Everything and anything was gone and I was completely devastated. Genius was extremely sympathetic and assured me that my AppleCare would cover the hard drive and that he could take care of it and I would be all set back up within 20 minutes.   As I waited, I wandered around the store and was asked a few more times if I needed any assistance by several friendly associates. When I went back to check the status, I mentioned that my trackpad had been wearing down after years of use, and how I would go about replacing it. Genius said, no prob, that he had it in stock and would swap it out. What I didn't realize was it was one part so I also got a new keyboard in the mix, so that was pretty sweet.   Now, I think Genius felt sorry for me to be honest. I'm not sure, but I really don't think the keyboard part, nor the battery are covered under AppleCare in normal circumstances, but that day apparently they were.   So I walked out of Apple with a practically new MacBook, finally that damn external hard drive, but no evidence of the last 3 years of my life. It was a super crappy day, but it could have been a lot worse. Thanks to Genius Alan and AppleCare, I was at least able to have a silver lining to the dark cumulonimbus hovering over my head.  When life hands you lemons, you make lemonade. If it gives you a rotten Apple- head to the Genius bar.

I don't leave Downtown often (read: ever) because there isn't much I can't find between 19th Ave & 16th St.  However, there are a few notable exceptions, one being the Commuter sandwich. Sometimes I wake up thinking about it, and my only option to clear my mind is to find the quickest way to Arcadia.  Fluffy scrambled eggs, tomato, mayo & filling of choice (I generally opt for the bacon or avocado) on a huge, warm, homemade English muffin. t is simple.. yet exquisite to my taste buds. I usually get a Tammie Coe cupcake to go for later consumption, but today I got a Halloween-themed chocolate & orange cupcake from the LGO Bake Shop, and it was one of the best cupcakes I've ever had..& I've had a lot of cupcakes in my day.  There is always a line but unless you're in a hurry it's not so bad since there is so much to look at while waiting. There are always new, random knickknacks and cute greeting cards. Today I checked out a cell phone holder that hoists your phone while it charges.. interesting.. The shop tends to be pretty pricey, but I guess that doesn't bother me so much since I keep going back. I really do hate trying to park though.

When I moved into Mandarina I really liked it. The staff was cool, my neighbors were nice, the grounds were well-maintained and it is in a good location if you have to commute between Tempe, Scottsdale & Phoenix, which I was doing at the time.   During the last couple months of living at Mandarina, they switched management. Really perplexing and annoying events started occurring. For some reason, the time they saw fit to do landscaping-extremely loud landscaping- was starting at 5 AM. And this was in the winter, so no heat excuses. The staff was suddenly never in the office when the hours were posted and took 2 hour lunches. The front security gate broke and "two weeks" turned into.. well I don't know because it was still broken when I moved out. At first the new management themselves seemed okay, the woman who was managing seemed  pretty nice and considerate. Then it came time for my roommate and I to move out--breaking the lease because of her upcoming promotion/move to another state. This is when  they showed their other, evil, manipulating, conniving, ruthless side. After completely ripping every last cent they possibly could out of us it got worse. The management company "misplaced" our final payments and I didn't find out until 2 months later when I was contacted by a creditor. Lovely. After a week of calls, voicemails, and getting the run around, the apartment fessed up to making a mistake, but we still had to pay interest that had accrued while there was a "remaining balance." We were freaked out about having this on our credit and just wanted to put the whole debacle behind us so we paid it without much fight.   The facility itself is nice, but I would never recommend it to anyone unless they had a different management team.

I have always had comfortable and easy experiences at Sky Harbor in the past, but I must say I had the best experience at the PHX airport last week which really topped it all off!  Traveling at Thanksgiving time is not for the faint of heart with long lines, pushy people, and lots of crying children everywhere. Not once did I see the staff at Sky Harbor even grimace. Everyone I encountered was so genuinely friendly and helpful, from the rental car shuttle driver, to the TSA agents, to the counter workers. I forgot to remove my liquids from my carry-on (gasp!) and the agent who inspected my bag did so quickly and sent me on my way with a "Happy Thanksgiving!" I have had similar issues at airports in the past where a simple search may turn into an ordeal. The lines moved briskly despite the throngs of people and the airport is nice & clean. Terminal 4 has a Paradise Bakery and free wifi. I really couldn't ask for anything more.

I love love love Angel Sweet, I just wish it was not in Chandler! It's a little bit pricier than most gelato shops I have been to in Phoenix, but not a big deal. They have a nice variety of choices, but my favorite by far is brownie batter, but they only have it every once in a while.

My roommate & I went to Lo-Lo's on a random late Saturday morning.. and never wanted to leave. We waited about 20 minutes, the staff was great & incredibly friendly. The food.. oh the food. Frankly, we were completely useless the rest of the day after our ridiculously delicious meal.  We both agreed that they were the best waffles and the best fried chicken we had ever had, respectively. The sweet tea was so good, as well as the corn bread with real creamy butter. We had every intention of trying the red velvet cake, but it was sadly an impossibility. Next time!

Elmer's Taco Shop is one of my favorite spots in the East Valley area to get Mexican food.  It has ample seating both indoors and outdoors and the prices are very affordable with Chandler HS across the street (but don't go during the high school lunch hour, the line is out the door.) Definitely try the strips  or the cheesy tortilla with beef. Amazing!

I lived off of Gus's pizza in the dorms. The pizza is good & incredibly cheap and the wings are some of the best I've had at pizza joints. An 18" pizza with two toppings and two drinks costs less than $10 and delivery is free and 24 hours. Best of all the delivery boys are always, without fail, completely high and usually ask if they can call you after their shift.  Food & entertainment, every time!

By far the best manicure and pedicure I've gotten from one of these type shops.. You know the ones with a giant sign that just says NAILS.. I walked in and only had to wait about 10 minutes. They had a good magazine selection, interesting wall art (a landscape of Phoenix in purples, yellows, and bright green) and a wonderfully cheesy karaoke video of love songs. Basically the best part of my experience was Benjamin, the technician who took care of me. He was the best! Benjamin was absolutely hilarious and incredibly meticulous (although because of his attention to detail, may take a little longer than you're used to..) I loved how he would announce he was about to massage by declaring it "happy feet time!" and that he took care to use my name when talking to me. Very sweet guy. Also it was quite reasonable at $30 for both :)

Whenever I want really good (New) Mexican food, I will go to Los Dos Molinos always & forever. I love the building (old hacienda former home of actor Tom Mix), I love the kick-ass margaritas, and I think about the carnitas more often than normal. My family has been going for years and years so I my perspective on the service is skewed, i love the sassy servers I see every time I go.  But even I know, if you show up less than a half hour before closing, they will give a loud exasperated sigh, look at their watch, then up at the clock, then back and you, and then possibly seat you. Maybe.  But there is a special place in my heart & stomach for Los Dos and this is by far my favorite location. It's a fun place to go with a group because no one cares how loud or tipsy you get and it's semi-amusing to see your friends get shot down when they ask for mild sauce.. just fyi. they don't do that. They "don't know HOW" to make mild sauce.

I was very surprisingly underwhelmed by Chelsea's Kitchen.   We walked in and the restaurant smells amazing with the open kitchen and I really dig the atmosphere. Our first impression was that our server- Katie McD- seemed kind of flighty and not very attentive, so that is never a good start. She wasn't very friendly and didn't even attempt to build a rapport with the table. She kept forgetting small things that should be second nature for servers. I ordered my iced tea, and had to wait until she came back with our appetizer to get a straw. (The same happened later to my cousin after she finished her sangria and ordered another drink) I then asked for sweetener and she turned around, grabbed it from another table and then put it in front of me saying 'They weren't using it.".. kind of awkward.   It has been my experience that great food can really overshadow bad service. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed once our meals came out. Maybe I had too high of hopes for Chelsea's Kitchen, after all I have had an ongoing love affair with La Grande Orange for years. I had the Dixie Pan Fried Chicken and it was just okay. The first thing I sampled was my mashed potatoes.. which were very lukewarm. Same for the mixed veggies (which were otherwise quite tasty)/ We waited about 5 minutes for Katie to come back and check so I could let her know, but got bored of it, and finished eating my now even colder plate.  They have a good portion size, not too much and the price would have been okay if my food had been served correctly (or even corrected). My meal came with a cinnamon roll which was really yummy and so was the red velvet cake we had for dessert. Definitely the best parts of my meal. (Dessert probably would have been better with coffee... if our server had been around to take our order..)   I kind of go back and forth between 2 and 3 stars, but I feel like 3 stars would be saying I'd go back and give it another go... and I doubt I will. The stars say it all: Meh, I've experienced better.

Don't go if you are in a hurry but definitely go if you're really hungry. I went on a Saturday morning and waited about 45 minutes. The servers were really friendly and not pushy even though you know they have a line of people waiting outside. I had the griddlecakes and my (very picky) friend had the salami scramble which he devoured. The food was really good, but I wasn't floored like I expected from what I've heard. I will definitely return though, it's a fun place to take people who don't venture to Phoenix much from the suburbs or are from out of town.

I adore this library, I could spend hours here. Libraries in general are amazing, you can learn, read, listen to music explore for hours for free and no one will bother you. This point of Phoenix pride is open, modern, and has a great selection.  The staff is really friendly and helpful in the few times I've needed them they are always easy to locate. They have several self-checkout stations, but there is alwaysa line, it would be nice if they also had a few more, or were more proactive in helping those who seem a bit confused with the machines.   I love the Phoenix Library system in general. I live closest to Yucca and frequent Burton Barr, both quite frequently (more in the summer when all I want to do is laze by the pool with a book). It is so nice to be able to check books out at Burton Barr, and drop them off at Yucca on my way to work or where ever I'm headed to. They also offer interlibrary loan, so I can request books to be delivered the branches closest to me. Super convenient! They also have a really great website to facilitate this all.  **My most recent and exciting discovery is the Culture Pass, which is awesome and I can't believe I haven't heard of it before! You can check out a pass to one of several of the museums or galleries in the area. You receive a slip from the librarian that you take to the site and it is good for 4 complimentary passes! It's good for a week from checkout time, and comes with other discounts you can also take advantage of. I love it! My friends and I went to Taliesen West this morning- usually $27 each for the tour we went on- completely free! This is such a great program, I really hope that it continues even with budget cuts.  It's a big, beautiful library, plus it's open on Sunday. You can't beat that!

After having an extremely stressful week I made an appointment for a massage a few days ago. Then I remembered I was broke, canceled the appointment & went to coffee with a good friend instead, hoping it would have the same effect.  We wound up at Copper Star which I had heard of but never been to-- I am glad we stopped! I loved how big it was inside and it seemed very welcoming. There were a lot of little groups around of people talking, eating, and studying-so I assume there is free wifi. I got an almond latte which was good and we sat outside on the patio to enjoy the late morning weather. My favorite part of the shop was probably the bathroom. I'm really into bathrooms right now, and this was a good one! Lots of good light, the faucet was awesome and I loved the blue tiling. I'll definitely be back to try a different drink, and maybe ask them to make it a bit stronger, that was my only woe. I didn't get a red velvet cupcake but they looked pretty delicious!

I've been back to Copper Star many more times than I can count, now that I am bumming on my friend's couch (This is right up the street from her place.) I really love the open and friendly atmosphere and I feel like the layout of the furniture really lends itself for people to interact and chat. They have a good internet connection, and I love me some free wifi. I can camp out and do homework for a couple hours and not feel like I am bothering anyone. The staff is friendly but it's a little awkward to see them canoodling with their significant others on the patio, and then come inside and start serving.. I don't watch too carefully but I am assuming (hoping) there is a quick trip to the (still lovely) washroom between.  I've had a few pastries, the blueberry muffins are good, but pretty standard, and I'm fairly certain from a mix,  but the red velvet cupcakes are fresh and tasty. Coffee is again, good, but not great, but this is definitely a great place to hangout, grab a snack, chit chat, enjoy the ambiance, and use the toilet.

All I remember about my black & blue burger was that it was the most delicious thing I had ever eaten.  However:  It was my 21st birthday. I had just sat through an incredibly hilarious/awkward chippendales show with my sisters, mom & grandmother.. and we hadn't eaten in about 15 hours BUT had enjoyed several yards of various alcoholic beverages while trekking up and down the strip in search of food.   But still.. I (vaguely)remember saying-repeatedly- that it was the best food I had ever come in contact with, so I gotta give it the best back.

I am so torn with this review.  I used to really like Ikea, I have never had any problems with products, everything is usually exactly as advertised and they have good sales if you are there on the right day. Most associates on the show floor are very friendly and knowledgable about their areas, which helps a lot when you don't know exactly what you are looking for. However, on Memorial Day, I had one of my worst retail experiences EVER at Ikea.  I am just settling back into a new condo in Phoenix, and am going to be slowly furnishing my place, and I assumed I would do so mainly with the help of thrift stores, estate sales, and Ikea. Now I'm not so sure. I got to the check-out area with my new bed at about 8:55 pm, the end of what I'm sure was a long day for us all. I was buying my bed on a smoking deal- hugely discounted with the purchase of a new mattress. This sale was advertised both in the showroom downtstairs as well as up in bedding. I went to wait in line at a cashier because I figured it was probably something manual they had to do themselves. However, while in line a man with a brown ponytail directed me to self checkout. I told him that I was buying something on sale and asked if it would make a difference and I was told no. They asked me how I was paying, I said part cash part debit. Okay. SO I then rang up all my items, and the sale did not come up like I anticipated. I asked the self-checkout attendant what I should do and she stared at me blankly, like I was speaking a foreign language. "Um. Do you have the coupon?" Uhh.. what coupon? I have talked to upwards of 5 employees about my bed and this is the first I hear of the coupon. By this time it's closing time 9pm. "You have to have a coupon. You have to go get it." From bedding? It's on the opposite side of the store, upstairs. Can someone bring it to me- no one told me about a coupon. "Ma'am. Listen. I understand but I already talked to my manager about this earlier you have to go get the coupon yourself." Now it's my turn to stare blankly. It is obvious to both parties that it was not my fault the coupon was not given to me while I was in bedding- however, I was very rudely being ordered that if I wanted the sale I'd have to go get the coupon myself. I just stood incredulously during this time- another cashier named Linda came up and told the girl to just call and have someone bring it down, she had done so several times earlier and it was no problem. "Yeah, um. I don't think they would want to do that." What? I found this to be a very bizarre response in front of a customer.  The girl ( I think her name was Randi) made a big sigh and show of calling bedding and apparently there was no answer. "They didn't answer. You have to go get it yourself." So.. there's no one answering.. why should I think there would be anyone to give me a coupon? Meanwhile ponytail man Todd- Randi's manager- comes by and says he can't help me, they need the coupon and that it says that on EVERY SIGN and the associates who helped me should have known that. Tired of waiting around I go to get the damn coupon that was unheard of until this time, but first I decide to go look at the sign on the ground floor and shocker- NOWHERE on the sign does it say anything about a coupon- and I double checked. I am walking back towards the escalator when crapbag Todd stops me and says they can try to make an exception without the coupon. I keep walking back towards the self-checkout area and tell him what I found- that there is no mention of a stinking coupon.  "Really?? They must have changed the signs!" These words actually came out of his mouth. Yeah. I'm sure they did. He goes and inspects them himself and takes the next 10 minutes tripping over himself apologizing for the whole issue. Whatever. I just want to buy my bed and leave. 9:20pm Now it's time to pay. "Um. Can't you put it all on your debit?" Oh my god. I said from the very beginning I was paying part cash. "We closed all the tills you can't pay cash. Can't you just see if it will go through on your card? You can deposit the cash before you overdraft." Did you really just ask me that? Where am I? They look at my friend. "Can't you split it with her? She'll pay you in cash." What is going on here? Linda- apparently the only clear thinking cashier at this place, steps in and tells everyone to calm down she hasn't closed her till yet. She rings me up- meanwhile Todd the toad is standing there apologizing over and over, pushing my cart, asking if there is anything he can do to help. Jerk. We take my stuff to the furniture pick up area, where they too are friendly and helpful, so this seems to be a very cashier specific problem with Ikea. One that needs to be taken care of ASAP, because I want to want to go back, and even now a week later, the whole ordeal is bizarre.  It only takes one bad experience to turn me off from a business. And then I not only tell ten friends, but I Yelp about it.

Chen & Wok is a quick stop away from my house (but half way between there and my gym... dangerous!) so it's very convenient for me. The food here is good, standard Chinese take-out. It's definitely the best I've had in my neighborhood, so here my loyalties shall lay.  The best part of the menu is definitely the lunch menu. Huge selection, with generous portions at a smoking deal-- starting at $3.40 up to$3.95. It's perfect for my nearly empty pockets these days. I haven't been able to find another place that I can have a cheaper, more fulfilling lunch! I've found it's best to order before and pick up, otherwise expect a loooong wait especially during peak lunch times.

I'm not sure if the owner/manager was trying to create a bustling NYC type atmosphere when I was there or what.. but it didn't work. He just came off rude and I didn't like it.  The slices were pretty good & they have cheap wings, but there are too many other businesses and life is too short to wait around for pushy pizza.

I wish I had time to be super creative, crafty and productive. Going into Made Art only makes that yearning stronger!  It's the perfect plact to find a variety of gifts for people of many interests. I was able to knock out my Christmas shopping for my 3 sisters, best friend, roommate, and a little something for myself in about an hour after about 50 circles around the store. (There is so much to see you have to do a few laps.)  They have really cute, funky baby clothes, but I personally find it difficult to spend too much money on something that will be dirty and smelly within a few minutes and then too small. They also have a really eclectic selection of books that are fun to leaf through, and even have some craft books in case you get inspired while you browse!  I don't know the name of the girl who assisted me but she was super helpful (and had great hair.) She went through my shopping list with me and would point out things I may have missed or paired a couple things here and there to make a fun set. You have to know a lot of what they have is hand made, and it's an independent boutique so prices will tend to be higher but  I don't find most of the stuff overly pricy at all for the unique quality you get.

As soon as I pulled up to Royal Coffee Bar, I knew it was love at first sight. This place is so tiny you could ship the whole thing for some pocket change. I adore outdoor seating. I am a total sucker for a patio, I can sit outside with a cup of coffee and good book for hours. The staff is great. I love Cameron, if you know her I'm sure you do too. She will make you something off the board if she thinks you'll like it.   Best of all, I really love the other customers. There's something about this shop that is a true third place, for lack of a better term. Last time I was there I was asking someone about apartments because I may be looking in a few months, and I got no less than three phone numbers and emails from people who knew people. It was a great downtown community moment, which in combination with the white chocolate almond latte concoction that had just been brewed for me, left me with a nice, warm fuzzy feeling.

My favorite part of Lost Leaf is that it still feels like a house more than a bar. It's like you're going to your buddy's house and everyone you run into looks semi-familiar which adds to the comfy feel. There is a friendliness and welcoming vibe to Lost Leaf that I just don't get at other area bars like The Roosevelt.   I can't help but adore the bar & the total embrace of leaving it as a kitchen. I love the beer & wine choices and seeing stuff on them I have never heard of and trying something new. Plus live music and local art, I am sold. This is definitely one of my favorite spots in Phoenix.

While I was home in Idaho, a new restaurant was opening, called Cafe Rio. Being Twin Falls, Idaho, a sleepy little town, this was a BIG deal. Lines were out the door, but my sister and I decided to brave the crowd.  I was so glad we did.  Fast forward one month to my first paycheck back in Phoenix, and my roommate and I are cruising along past Phoenix.. Tempe.. Mesa.. and find ourselves in Gilbert, for the sole purpose of getting a salad.  Now, this is not just any salad, but it is one of the most delicious taco salads I have ever had. Lettuce, tortilla strips, cojita cheese, rice, beans, salsa, sour cream, guacamole, and meat of your choice (pork barbacoa. ALWAYS choose the pork barbacoa!) nestled in a warm tortilla that was made right before your eyes, then drizzled in the house creamy cilantro dressing. Uh-mazing.   I can only testify to this one dish however. (Or I suppose the tostada.. exact same, except instead of the flour tortilla, a small corn tortilla). The first time I went I got the quesadilla with chile roasted beef. It was okay.. I wouldn't have been back if it wasn't for me trying my sister's salad, which we have established is enough for me to spend my finite resources on (cash, gas).  The service here also leaves a bit to be desired, but whatever. I'm not here for the ambiance (although some very nice art pieces), or the clientele (lots of families), or the reading material (The Beehive).  They do have a customer loyalty card - buy 10 meals get 1 free- which seems to be a dying art these days, which is just too bad, because Cafe Rio has made a loyal customer out of me!

Take it from someone who has shopped for cars an inordinate amount of time for her mere 21 years, the folks at Camelback Toyota are good guys. The dealer I worked with Samir was really friendly and knowledgeble, and the way he actually tried to kiiiind of talk me out of some extra features he didn't think I really needed they way I insisted (ie. moon roof, sports package, etc.) reminded me of a dad. The staff as a whole wasn't pushy and let me take my time in deciding over a couple days without stalking me over the phone. When I finally did decide, I felt they gave me a really fair price for my trade in and the rest of the process was fairly quick & painless. While we were waiting for all the paperwork to be drawn up, Samir gave me some great tips for backpacking through Europe, an interest we found we shared.  When I went back a few weeks later to schedule a time to get my windows tinted the sales manager I worked with remembered me by name which I also thought was cool. All in all a really good experience as far as car dealers go.   ps. Mr. Showcase Honda, obviously I took your advice and bought a Toyota.

Around 8 PM my roommates and I are hungry, not wanting to cook, so we decide on pizza. This Pizza Hut is a stone's throw from our house and we have a coupon, sounds simple enough.  WRONG.  After ordering online, I pull up to Pizza Hut around 8:30 and walk up to the door.It's locked. Confused, I try the other door. Locked. There's a boy inside sweeping. He looks at me, I gesture to the door, and he then continues to sweep. Huh? I walk back to my car and look up the phone number on my GPS, there is no answer, so I drive home. I get to the house and tell my roommates what happened, so we pull up the online order and see if we were able to order due to a glitch, since they were obviously closed. 9 PM closing time. It's now about 8:45 or so, and my phone rings as we are still looking at the computer.  "Hey this is... from Pizza Hut.. are you going to pick up your pizza?" Um... I tried.. "Okay.. so how long will it take you to get here?" Um... 5 minutes I guess...  I drive back and walk up to the door. The door is still locked, that kid in the corner is still sweeping. I knock loudly on the door and three people appear from the back kitchen area.   "Sorry about the mix up, we upgraded your order for you." Open the box- instead of the Supreme Pizza Mia we ordered is a very old looking pepperoni stuffed-crust pizza. Huh? "So the total is $16.25." What? Is this happening?  .. Um I'm not paying for this... Everyone looks at everyone awkwardly, but the kid in the corner keeps sweeping. "Oh.. Okay..hold on." The man in a tie, who I assume is the manager goes into the back and grabs one of their new pasta dishes, and puts it on top of the unwanted pizza. "Tell you what- Dinner is on me today, miss, have a great night." Um.. okay.. Thanks... Never got an explanation for the bizarre first trip and more importantly never even got the pizza we ordered.  Drove back home.

Every time I go to Bar Smith it is dead, & I think this is very sad and disappointing! I've been there on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. The staff, especially the bartenders are really fun and affable & the house music & djs are generally pretty darn good (depending on the night though...last Thursday I heard Jesse McCartney downstairs, I felt like I was back home in Idaho.)   I love the rooftop bar and dance area (everyone go. now. the weather is perfect!) The drinks are relatively cheap, which surprised me. The lack of lighting doesn't bother me a bit, it adds to the swanky, slightly mysterious ambiance of the area, and I think (I hope!) pretty soon Bar Smith is going to start having a stronger & more consistent following and will be a snazzy place to see and be seen in downtown.

I stopped in at Bar Smith again last night, and the entire block (Silver, Sky Lounge, etc.) was PACKED. Lots of dancing downtstairs, the house music on the roof was fun & funky and everyone seemed to be having a good ol' silly time. It was really exciting to see so many people at the downtown clubs! I think they are being to become more strict about covers and dress code but for now it is still pretty relaxed. I hope once the lightrail opens, everyone finds somwhere other than the tracks to hang outside, though-it makes me nervous!

I adore, love, crave, & dream about good Greek food.  That being said, I just don't enjoy My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. (And I really hate when people just call it My Big Fat..how appetizing is that??)  My biggest problem is with the pita. I mean, really, you're a Greek restaurant, you should at the VERY least have good pitas. They taste straight out of the store-bought bag. After that, there really is no redemption.  The menu is very chain standard, and is good for families with kids and big groups. It's definitely good for people with big appetites because their portion sizes are out of control.  There are better restaurants in the area for sure, even better restaurants right there in the AZ Center.

I've been going to Tangible Fitness for about 3 months now-and 28 lbs/$75/countless minutes on the elliptical later- I'm definitely a fan!  There's no contract, and it's month to month for only $25/month- or for early birds only $18 if you go before noon. The space is always very clean and the machines are nicely spaced so you don't feel crowded or like you can smell the sweat off the person next to you. Also, everyone who works out here seems to be very considerate, cleaning up after themselves and not too many machine hogs.   The staff (minus the weekend crew) is very friendly  and make an effort to remember your name which is such a lovely benefit of going somewhere small and local.  The drawback, however, is that the hours are limited. They close at 11pm on weekdays and 7pm on weekends, which just seems too early to me. One of my only gripes!  I haven't taken any of their classes yet, but with a new Zumba one starting, I hope to soon!

UPDATE! Apparently are now staying open! Yay! Looking for a new gym was depressing me!  --------------------------- I just got word that Tangible Tanning & Fitness is closing down the fitness center at the end of February... (Tanning salon remain open)   So depressed. Finding a comparable gym will not be easy or fun!  Sad to see you go!

There is honestly not a single, solitary thing I can think of that I dislike about Palatte so Instead I will list what I adore:  I love the story of the building and the Cavness House itself. I love the passion & vision of the owners. I love that it can let you feel carefree and a little self-indulgent for a couple hours. I love the outdoor seating and the billowy curtains. I really love the bathrooms--a lot. I love that they have switched to waiter service. I love the big picnic table for groups or stragglers.  I crave the sweet potato pancakes & I would bathe in the banana porridge.  I have pretty much had it all.. and like I said... wonderful, delicious & blissful every bite.

When I was a younger girl, I would tag along with my sisters to go to Name Brand, and it was sooooo cool.   Either it has changed or I have.. I went to Name Brand this weekend and it was really unimpressive. Most of the "name brands" here were Old Navy or Mossimo. It seems like they are not very selective based on the overcrowded racks and shelves.   The staff is young and hip and totally daft. They just kind of flick around not helping people and looking at themselves in the mirror... So pass on Name Brand, there are quite a few superior consignment shops in the Phoenix area, with a lot less attitude and weird smell.  Cute, cheapo sunglasses though.

Having a 3 hour break between classes at ASU downtown gives me and my girlfriends plenty of time to try new restaurants a couple times a week.  I must say we had a lovely, lovely experience at 101 Bistro. We sat outside on the patio and people watched for about 2 hours in the sunshine, listening to their surprisingly good overhead music, and eating incredibly satisfying Mediterranean inspired food.   I loved that there is ample outdoor seating and everything was reasonably priced  The pitas were warm & delicious, and best of all they were not stingy with the feta cheese, which is one of my pet peeves at Greek restaurants. The baklava looked incredible but we were far too full and lethargic after all the food and sunlight.   The only reason they lose a star is because the service wasn't too stellar, which is pretty bothersome seeing as there were only 2 tables taken in the place.  It's a good thing we weren't in any hurry because it was definitely drawn out meal. All in all it was a very nice experience and I will definitely be back.

I like this Los Dos Molinos because you still get the amazing food, without the wait. It's a more relaxed setting (although for me half the fun of going to Los Dos on Central is the ambiance) but that is somewhat reflected in the service which can be less than stellar. Still, I don't think there is a better place for Mexican food in the downtown area for sure. The carnitas are perfectly cooked & tender, the tortillas are some of the best I've had, and the salsa & sauces will make your mouth want to fall off.  All in all, a great Los Dos addition as far as convenience, and the food is just as addicting, but I would head to the Central location for the full experience.

I wandered in after coffee at Copper Star next door and I can't believe I hadn't been here before. I adored it. Even though it is jam-packed full and cramped, almost slightly uncomfortable, I think it makes me like it even more, like it is busting at the seams with music!  So much vinyl, I can't wait to bring my dad here when he is in town next month, he will spend hours going through their huge selection to add to his stereo room. The staff seems super friendly and knowledgeable.  I bought a used Sergio Mendes cd for $6 in great condition.. and better yet "Pillow Talk" with Doris Day & Rock Hudson for $1.50. It doesn't get much better than that! Such a cute area, I don't know why I don't spend more time on Melrose.

Maybe it was post-Tina Turner afterglow, maybe it was the amazing company of my best buddy and sister, maybe it was the tequila and the lime...   After the concert, we were famished from watching Tina with all of her crazy energy, so we followed the crowds to Margaritaville. The decor is as far from sublte as you can imagine. There is fake sea gull poo. There was a live band and lots of Wast Valley folk getting down. There are plastic palm trees and two over-the-top levels of Caribbean "paradise."  The reason I just have to give this place 4 stars despite all it's ridiculousness and awful kitsch, is that  our server was awesome- and for me, service absolutely makes or breaks an experience. He was incredibly cool and patient which is pretty amazing considering how flooded this place gets with patrons after shows. All I wanted in the world was a blue cheese burger & they don't offer one. So, I (annoyingly I'm sure) chose a random burger off the menu and substituted all the toppings to make exactly what I wanted and the server didn't even blink. When I got my burger (quickly too!) it was just how I had ordered it, PLUS cooked correctly AND even remembered that I wanted onion rings instead of french fries.  For that moment in time, I was a very happy Parrothead.  I don't plan on making the trek out to Glendale to become a regular or anything, but it is definitely a place I would go in the future for a "Cheeseburger in Paradise" after a nearby event!

My roommate and I broke our strict diets today for a Thai craving and we were happy we did! The restaurant was really quiet tonight, as most downtown places usually are on Monday nights, so we got quick, friendly service. I ordered the swimming rama, which was beef in peanut sauce over steamed veggies. Yum! Very tasty, and would definitely order again. Roomie got pad pik sod, which was mixed vegetables and jalepenos with chicken. Watch out this one was spicy but sooo flavorful! He loves spicy food and his eyes were a little glassy through the meal, but by the end we were both members of the clean plate club. Our dining partners got yellow chicken curry and tom yum soup, which looked amazing as well.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is open and clean, if a bit sterile. Prices were reasonable about $10-15 for most plates. My entree was definitely enough for me to return, but everyone else's food looked so good too, I might have to try something new next time!..... but for now back to our diets :|

I'm a gelato purist, so Chill is right up my alley. You don't have a million flavor choices, but the ones they have are classics done right, so there is no need. The same lady is always working when I go, and she is very friendly and upbeat. They haven't yet perfected the multi-flavor ratio in one cup, but I'm sure that will improve, and I'm a huge fan of anything with a punch card. So far my favorite gelato spot in the Valley :)

I've been going to Pete's with my family on AZ roadtrips for as long as I can remember, so I know these well:  The rules:  No  debit or credit cards No checks No 50s or 100s No separate orders No ketchup--don't even ask. No Sundays No feeding the pigeons Clean up after yourself, your mother does not work here.  So bossy, so cheap, so mouth-wateringly delicious. Forget about your precious ketchup, Pete's Special Sauce knocks my socks off. Careful with parking, it can be cutthroat--especially on Fridays.

For whatever reason, this is where my mom wanted to go on Mother's Day. I can't remember having gone here since I was about 9, and then I just remembered pigs everywhere and sawdust on the floor.  I could tell as soon as we walked in that little had changed at Waldo's over the years! I'm not usually a huge bbq fan, I'm not big on sweet sauces, but I really enjoyed my meal. Our server was very (maybe overly) attentive and friendly, but there were only 2 other tables in the place at 4pm. (It kind of seemed like during our meal the whole staff would be watching us from the counter which reminded me a little of Fried Green Tomatoes... and we all know what was in that barbecue.. )  I had a combo plate with pulled pork and ribs and they were both very flavorful and tender. It came with two sides-I had the cowboy beans which were pretty underwhelming, but I liked my sweet potato fries. The cornbread brought to the table was cold, I'm not sure if that was intentional or not. I also liked how everything was served in little skillets, cute touch.   All in all, everything was very friendly and down home feeling. It is far from me in Phoenix so I don't think I'd make a trip just for that, but if I was hanging out in Mesa, it would definitely be on my mind.

I'm growing out my hair so I've been putting even the slightest trim off since I have the world's slowest growing hair. I knew it had been a long time since I cut my hair, but had to refer back to my last salon review on Yelp to confirm.. 16 months. Yikes!   Since I was only looking for a trim, I was just interested in a cheap cut. My friend gave me a coupon for $5 off the regular adult $15 cut. This $10 haircut has made my hair look better than ever.  I have naturally curly hair, but I straighten daily so my stylist Abby gave me a dry cut. It was my first dry cut, but now I think I will always insist on it. We were able to see exactly how much length I was losing (or more importantly keeping!) and gave a good feel when she thinned my hair out. My hair looks like it barely lost any length, only so much healthier and maintained. I swear it even looks shinier! It was Abby's day off but she took me as a client because the salon got slammed suddenly while she she was there getting her own hair done. I'm so grateful she did!  Abby is definitely 5 stars. The salon is just average. The receptionist is pretty much a dingbat, she seemed quite flustered when my sister and I came as a walk-in and we were told to come back in 45 minutes even though there was only one person in a chair and no one in the waiting area. When we came back, the waiting area was packed but still only a couple stylists, so I would recommend making an appointment, because their scheduling seems to leave a bit to be desired.   Regardless, I hope in a year when I work up the courage to get my hair cut again, Abby is still around! My $10 haircut kicks all the other $40-60 cuts I've been getting all these years to the curb.

I love Pizza-A-Metro and so does Joe Arpaio. I am quite certain it is the only thing we have in common.  This is where I take my foodie friends because they are usually so busy eating they shut up for a while. (I kid, I kid...) I have never had anything here that I don't find super delicious and crave-worthy. The first time I went here my party was personally doted on by Maurizio, who was over-the-top gracious and seemed to truly love what he was doing.  While I don't see him every time I am here, the service never suffers.  The calamari is crisp and light, which is a nice change from heavy, fried calamari that is so ubiquitous in too many Italian joints. Hands down my favorite item on the menu is the Frescolina. The combination of the arugula and prosciutto makes my mouth water even thinking about it!  So next time you are at Pizza-A-Metro, my advice is don't loudly discuss if the portly man next to you is Joe Arpaio. Don't look him up on your Blackberry and pass the photo around to get the opinion of your fellow diners. Don't bring up that his mother died in childbirth, and how that potentially explains a great deal of the man's 'politics.' No matter how much wine you have had, do not forget how small this restaurant is. Because in the end, after he and his bodyguards leave, the server will tell you- Yeah. That was him.

I missed so many things about Phoenix while I was on my internship in Florida.... Family. Friends. Fresh & Easy (the whole 'F' thing is pure coincidence.)  This is the closest Fresh & Easy to my new home and I love it just like all the others I have encountered. My favorite section of the store (besides the clearance corners) is the area of semi-prepared food, portioned for 1 or 2, and are mix-and-match. They are perfect for me and my lack of cooking skills, tasty and so easy. Plus, they are almost always having a demo (samples!)  The Fresh & Easy brand is quite nice too; I am currently enjoying their own cranberry almond crunch cereal and there were many more to choose from. Gelato is a must try as well. As if variety, flavor, and quality aren't enough, but Fresh & Easy is super affordable too! $.99 loaf of wheat bread, milk is 2 gallons for $4, you really can't beat that! Finally, there is rarely a line at the self-checkout stands which is so nice when you just want to get in and out quickly or are just picking up a thing or two for dinner, but there is always an attendant nearby in case you have any questions.   So, suffice to say I will be visiting this market often, see you there neighbors!

What can I say, except I LOVE District! The street-side dining is great, especially right now when the weather is amazing. The theme American Kitchen & Wine bar runs deep and you will find wonderful, delicious comfort food, carefully crafted by Chef Nathan. My personal favorites are the golden calamari, AZ Sweet Shrimp Po' Boy sliders & the scallops, seared to perfection. Wash it all down with a $3.75 (seriously) microbrew & don't forget to save room for dessert. The pumpkin whoopie pies served with a mini bourbon malt shake will make you greedy & not want to share, but you will because you get 3. They also have some of the most attentive & friendly servers I've ever encountered.  Don't worry about parking, District validates for up to 3 hours in the garage. Stop by the Sheraton & give the newest addition to downtown dining a try, you won't regret it!

This Krispy Kreme bums me out. The stars are for sheer convenience. I've gone 3 times before work because it's on my way, they have a drive-thru and it opens at 5:30, which is nice for us early risers.  Things that aren't nice:   Major inconsistency. I know it's just opening, but they should have some sort of supervision for quality control..Once my creamer/sugar/stirrer/napkins were tidily put into a little bag, other times they hand them to me like a kid scooping dirt out of a sandbox with two hands. Twice I didn't get anything to stir my coffee with and everything just settled to the bottom.. depressing.  I swear I didn't once get the donut I ordered. Most disappointingly, they once gave me a cake donut. Who orders a cake donut at Krispy Kreme? Cold, hard, blah. It defeats the entire purpose.

Yo me gusta Lola Coffee.   Friendly baristas, high quality espresso, and I love places that include tax in their prices. My first time in, I had the Matador, which was nice and creamy, if a bit sweet for my tastes. I've stuck to cappuccinos since, which have always been well made. I enjoy the layout and design of the cafe and the unpretentious air. As always, I appreciate a nice, clean restroom. Have yet to use their wifi but surely will soon!   This place is definitely giving other coffee joints a run for their money in my heart!

I generally seem to think of all these -berto's type fast food places to be all the same.   But Amando's is soooo good. I've been a hardcore Filiberto's girl since the womb I'm sure, but the lack of one in my 'hood has forced me to start going elsewhere for my breakfast burrito needs.   Amando's more than fills the void. I crave their bean & cheese burrito on a nightly basis, I swear--and no extra charge for cheese! (I hate when -bertos does that! oh and no fee for debit card either!) They have great salsa and I think that is what sets their food apart from the others. The salsa verde is awesome, but packs a punch so watch out.  Other than the slightly awkward location (getting around the light rail and turning out of the lot is kind of annoying) Amando's is cheap, easy, and convenient. If you are in this area and have a craving, don't be afraid to give them a try! They have combos and daily specials with free drinks in a lot of them, and most importantly, 24-hour yummy, greasy Mexican food. Mmmm.
