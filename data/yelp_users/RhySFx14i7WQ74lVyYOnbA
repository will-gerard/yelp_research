We went to dinner for New Years Eve and everything was wonderful.  We usually go to Tutti Santi in Glendale but it was closed for renovation.  We were really happy we got to experience such a magical restaurant.

Beautiful Hotel with a lovely pool!  I tried out most of the resorts and I have to say this one is in the top 5 in the valley.

Rosati's has the worst customer service.  I could not believe the way I was treated today.  I never post anything negative but I could not believe how I was treated today by the manager.  They delivered the wrong pizza so I called to have them deliver the right pizza.  The person addressing my issue on the phone was basically telling me that he couldn't do anything about it.  So I asked to speak to the manager and he told me, "I am the manager and i'm very busy right now."  This is ridiculous!!  I will never place an order with Rosati's and was going to use them for catering next month for a party I'm having but will go to a different Italian restaurant.   It's very sad to have insensitive people running restaurants ...Do the owners not know what's going on?
