Great food but the service while friendly was slow.  Wonderful salads and soups. Nice white wine list.

We loved this hotel.  Excellent service and accommodations.  The dealers could benefit from a customer service course (some were great, some grumpy), but that is my only complaint.  The rest of the staff members were wonderful which is a huge accomplishment as 10K people are employed by the property.  Well worth the price to have the fountain view.

Disappointing.  Although the choices were plentiful, the hot food was cold and too greasy.

Excellent Mexican food.  There is a reason there is a wait for lunch.  The tortilla soup was the best I ever tasted.  Great presentation and good service.

I love this place. Great decor, upscale Mexican.  The guacamole is outstanding.  The enchiladas Diego are the best I have ever experienced.  A must for Mexican food lovers.

Surprised by the high reviews for this show.  I love O and really like Mystere. This show was a bit disappointing.  Several wonderful scenes and stunning acrobatics but not enough for me to recommend it. I did not like the costumes, techno music or the warfare theme. Much of the dancing scenes were a bit of a mess and it dragged at times.  They even brought out shadow puppets.  wonderful sequences with batons, a moving wall and ferris wheel type spectaular.  All 6 of us were disappointed.

I love this piano bar.  Perfect for people watching at the Bellagio.

We had a wonderful meal.  As a fan of fusion cuisine, I loved the mixing of regions and flavors.  Calamari and the fish special were standouts.  Great wait staff and wine list.
