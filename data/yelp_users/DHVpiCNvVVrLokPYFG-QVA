Here's what I love about La Parilla Suiza: its simply good. The strip mall location across from the un-hip PV mall doesn't bely the fantastic experience inside.   I've eaten there many times throughout the years and it never disappoints. Since leaving PHX, its been a couple of years since I stopped through, but this experience felt like a homecoming. Why do I bother with other "trendy" locations when my old friend stays consistently great?  The tortilla soup is EXACTLY what it is supposed to be. If you get it, don't skimp on the sour cream and avocado because the extra calories are well worth it. The broth itself is flavorful if simple, the tortilla strips are toasted THEN added to the soup and its just too good for words.  I also had the fish tacos on this trip - I usually don't eat fish tacos, there is nothing worse than a place that messes up such a simple dish, but La Parilla didn't disappoint. The tortillas are soft and pliable, the fish was remarkably good and the batter wasn't too over powering. They don't heap 12lbs of junk on it, they just let it shine. They keep the fresh chips coming and the "green" salsa is so good, I usually ask for additional to take home.  I have had the Parilla Suiza that other Yelpers love and I concur with their assessments too.   And on our last trip, during a fairly busy lunch, we are greeted with warmth immediately both at the door and by Hector our waiter. He practically TRIPPED over himself to give us great service. Never rushing, just making sure everything was great. He made recommendations and honestly, made me feel like I was in the large home of a great cook.   I just think the food here is underrated, its simple, fresh and well done. The service is always warm and prompt..and I now that my green salsa is gone, I guess I will have to wait until I am in PHX again for anything even remotely so good.   If you haven't been, you should. Prices are reasonable, the staff is great and the cooks are confident enough to let the food stand on its own without layers of junk.  Why can't more restaurants, Mexican or not take a note from that book?   Adios PHX and La Parilla Suiza, I'll see you next time!

For years I endured the Phoenix New Times. I read it..because it was free (isn't that why anyone picks it up?).  But my story about a brief discussion with an editor says it all.   I wrote to the editor to explain my disappointment with a particular article. I actually said that they were doing themselves a disservice by calling this particular story "real" since it was actually a farce; that's not journalism, its fiction..yet this publication continues to call itself a news source.   Almost immediately, I received a reply from the editor. When I saw it in my "inbox" I assumed it was a "form" response. You know, "thanks for contacting us, blah blah blah".  Imagine my surprise to see that it was from an editor, personally insulting me and my intelligence! After the initial shock of receiving a poorly written personal attack from an EDITOR, I replied only that he had "eloquently proven my point." to which he responded again with another insult. I decided that I was the bigger person at this point, and stopped communicating.   Since then, I have never picked up a New Times or any of their sister publications. I encourage others to stop justifying the New Times existence by even so much as lining their bird cages with it. What a waste of trees.

I remember when there weren't so many Miracle Mile delis in Phoenix..and getting a pastrami straw took some strategy and patience and waiting at Park Central mall with hundreds of people. Today, you can get your straw and eat it too before you go back to the office at one of many locations.   I'll admit to a bit of nostalgia over the mix of people and the long-I'm-going-to-wait-no-matter-what lines.   Whenever I am in Phoenix, there are TWO must-have stops. One is some local place with Chorizo..and the other..is Miracle Mile. Thank GOD I don't have to go to New York for a good sandwich.

The aptly named Big Breakfast isn't the only thing they should be famous for. The food is not only generous, its fresh. The potatoes are home made (nothing processed here) and the bread appears as if its never seen a bag in its life.   They kept the coffee coming!   We didn't wait at ALL on Tuesday at 7AM so if you work downtown, do yourself a favor and hit Matt's before work one day..you'll beat the traffic, the Saturday lines and be so full, you probably won't need much of a lunch.   In short: fresh food, tall coffee, tasty treat. Well worth it. Even with a wait.

Without a doubt, one of the most memorable meals of my life.    This experience is like going to the theatre where the kitchen is the symphony, the meal and wine the story and the service staff the performers.   We opted for the tasting menu and wine pairings. It was a splurge, but well, well worth it. I said to my husband when we decided to opt for the tasting menu, that we had to get the pairings, as it would have near impossible to choose a bottle or two that would have done the menu justice. What an amazing choice that turned out to be.   The menu itself is a story of culinary finery, but when paired with the wines, the symphony begins. The pairings were where the magic really happened. There was one wine for every two courses. I had to wonder how they would pull that off, but I needn't have worried. The story of the meal just flows together like chapters in a book.  Its just so unusual to have a meal so perfectly orchestrated.   I wasn't as much a fan of the seating as some, but throughout the course of the meal, it grew on me. I love watching the kitchen work, almost without conversation. The Chef acts as a wordless conductor, and each person knows their role so well, that the entire kitchen is on cue and service staff move throughout the stage seamlessly. It really was like watching a ballet.   The service was elegant, but never stuffy we never wanted for a single thing. Kawika was our primary server and we adored and his fantastic service. Chef came by to talk with us after our meal We were absolutely gushing like adolescent fans and and Chef was as gracious and lovely as a man could be.    I'll be talking about this meal for years to come.

"What can I do to get you to stay? This is MY restaurant and I'd like to make you happy"  You have to give kudos to a GM who approaches two unhappy, snarky women with a warm smile and a conciliatory approach. A GM who makes you feel like they WANT you to stay (as opposed to the assistant manager who stood there shrugging his shoulders at us.) Af GM who solves the problem and so we can  move onto a really nice dinner. Our bumpy start did not belie the rest of the evening.   First up, the food: We started with the Burretta ala Panna, which is essentially a totally dressed-up-befitting-of-Scottsdale bruschetta...as in FAB-U-LOUS!  We also had the scallops which were perfectly cooked, a lot of places just don't do it right - they do. Yay! Then for dinner we split the Proscuitto and Basil Wrapped Borzino.  I have to say, I normally SKIP the fish entrees in Scottsdale (because I am spoiled rotten when it comes to fish) but THIS..THIS my desert dwellers is worth coming out of your shells for.. Interesting dish, great textures and perfectly seasoned. Memorable. It made me look up the chef..THAT'S how good it was. I figure we'll be hearing from him again. Our side of sauteed spinach was perfect and not dripping in goop, and our desert of green tea creme brulee with a totally tasty macaroon was creamy, yummy goodness.    We didn't graze the cocktail menu, though I wish I would have. We DID have a couple of wines by the glass. I will say, I wish those offerings were a little more extensive, but we did  find a nicely balanced Paso Robles Syrah that was new to me (and I am a Paso fanatic). I suspect there are other under-rated finds on the wine list. I love that, don't you? Finding some new wine to adore?  The service was genteel and warm. My only comment about the service is that our server was new and he could have used some training on the menu. He'll be one of the best when he's been there a bit longer - go see him, he's adorable: Les.   The atmosphere is Scottsdale-lush. We sat outside on our particular evening, but the restaurant's interior is GORGEOUS. I hate to bring this up because its plain bizarre, but the bathrooms are lovely. I mean, really, gold leaf wall paper? Doesn't feel like a recession in there.   Honestly,despite all the raves, the most impressive thing about this restaurant was that they turned it around. We were ready to leave and we ended up staying because they made it clear that they wanted us to..and I am glad we stayed, we would have missed out on a great night.   I'm sure I'll be back. It was worth coming over the entire Pacific just for that Borzino!

Dinner with friends which started out as 5 and grew to 6 mid-dinner. Our server was super helpful in accommodating even though it was a busy Saturday night.   We started with several bruchetta planks, the prosciutto, fig and marscapone with truffle oil was my personal hand's down fave. But really, they were all good. We also had the antipasti plate, which was a really great blend of savory treats.  THEN. On to the main event: PIZZA.   We had the Brussel Sprout pizza, which everyone loved, but I think I loved it a little more. We also had the truffled mushroom (seeing a trend), which I loved even MORE than the brussel sprout and we had the Porco, which I loved (but still loved) least. The Porco has an unexpected amount of kick, which I appreciated.   After 4...or was it 5 (?) bottles of wine, a relaxing and enjoyable evening we were on our way.   It was a fun dinner, for a reasonable price. I'd totally go back again.   So if you go: Get something with truffles. That is all.

I used to love, love, love Pita Jungle. I went to ASU and it got me through college. After college, its the place I could eat a nice meal when on a diet. I always liked the food and casual friendly atmosphere.   My last visit there left me feeling decidedly "meh". The service was so casual that we barely saw our waitress once after ordering: to bring the bill. There were 3 of us - we ordered 3 apps and 3 dinners.  Dinner was "fine", though I remember it tasting "fresher" but what'ev. I wasn't expecting 5-star anything. It was a casual dinner with friends.   Also, you should know that if you want extra pitas with your apps, you can expect them to arrive with the bill.   So, if you go: be patient and order extra pitas when you order your iced tea.

I get to Scottsdale a couple of times a year, so I've been lucky enough to hit the Herb Box a couple of times since it opened in downtown Scottsdale.   My first visit was for brunch..I had the famous red velvet pancakes. Oh laaarwd...honey. Those pancakes are a religious experience. I don't remember what else we ordered because the pancakes were stupid-good. As if it wasn't enough, I had a couple of mimosas too. I'd say it was um....better than...most breakfasts I've had.   The second time was a laaazy lunch with a girlfriend. We each has a flatbread she Brussel sprout and pancetta on the recommendation of our server,  I had pear and gorgonzola. Let me begin by saying that pear and gorgonzola is one of my favorite flavor combinations..and brussel sprouts, decidedly not. BUT, here, the sprouts are grilled and that pancetta is that salty goodness. OHHHHHHHH-MY. That flatbreat blew my pear and gorgonzola out of the water.   We also had a couple of drinks off their drink menu, I had a cucumber water-mint number with vodka that was perfectly refreshing for a summer day in Scottsdale. My girlfriend had a raspberry mojioto (if I remember correctly) and it was pretty fabulous as well. Don't tell anyone..but we didn't stop at one.   Out server was a pro. She has us at "go". She was funny and attentive and patient with our endless requests for more water and limes. I can not NOT for the life of me remember her..but she was fantastic and a pro.  If you go, get those red velvet pancakes..and listen when your server makes a recommendation..they know their stuff there.

I mean, seriously, +10 for the service. It's totally earnest. I wouldn't say its overly prompt or efficient, but its hard to fault a guy who is trying so hard.   We went for breakfast.  I loved Alo because its adorable and it wasn't crowded with the Spring Training-already loaded-at-9AM-hipsters. Surely after getting such great reviews that will change, but that's the price of success I guess.   MY food was pretty forgettable, I had a breakfast sandwich, it just looked so sad and lonely on my plate. Pretty meh. But everyone else's breakfast looked amaze-balls and they scarfed it up. My breakfast sandwich was gone pretty fast too...it just wasn't anything to celebrate. Also, not at ALL a fan of that coffee. I drink a lot of coffee and I had no desire to have cup #2. But you know, coffee is pretty subjective...so let me know what you thought.   So if you go: skip the breakfast sandwich, do something else. And keep it a secret, because this place is tiny and the service can't get much more earnest.
