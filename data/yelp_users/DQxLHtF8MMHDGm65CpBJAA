My husband and I have both registered for a tri later this year (he's doing an olympic distance, I'm doing a sprint), so we stopped in here to check out some gear.  I was so impressed with the staff and how helpful they were!  This is my first tri, so I have a lot of questions, and they were so patient explaining everything to me, going over different tri clothing options, etc.  I will definitely shop here again!!

I had the carne asada torta and loved every bite of it!  The meat was so tasty, and the sandwich was pretty filling (although it was so good I could have eaten another and just suffered through being really full).  My friends and I also had the guacamole, which may now be my favorite guacamole.  It had a great kick to it with a lot of cilantro...yum!  We got there around 1:00 in the afternoon, and it wasn't crowded, but I'm guessing we were there after the lunch rush.  Parking did seem to be a pain as the spots in back were pretty limited.

I should start with the caveat that I'm giving it four stars considering its location.  Anywhere else (San Francisco, Seattle, etc.) I think it would be just average Chinese food and sushi, but for Arizona I think it's definitely four stars.  The sushi is decent--nothing amazing but it's not bad either.  I've been pleased with the entrees I've tried and the servings are generous.  My family of four usually gets three entrees and a large soup, and we have plenty of leftovers for the next day.

I'd give it zero stars if I could, based solely on service.  The pizza was typical Pizza Hut--I don't think it ever tastes different.  I called in my order on a Friday night and was told it would be 15 minutes.  I got there right around then, paid (wasn't given a receipt), and was told my order was still in the oven.  Okay, no big deal.  I assume they'd let me know when it was done.  that was a mistake!!  After sitting there another 15 minutes (so, 30 minutes after I had originally called and was told it would be 15 minutes) I finally asked.  They asked for my receipt--it was a different cashier--and looked annoyed at me that I didn't have it.  She reluctantly went to check on my order and brought it back.  When I told her how long I'd been sitting there waiting she said, "Oh I didn't realize you were waiting."  Oh really?  You get a lot of people just hanging out here not waiting for a pizza?  I can understand it being busy on a Friday night, but to not even apologize for their complete lack of service really ticked me off.  We rarely order chain pizza anyway, but the next time I need to for some reason, it will not be from here!

My husband and I bought a Groupon for Brick a few months ago and finally went last night.  Eh.  It was okay.  There's definitely better pizza to be had in downtown Phoenix (*cough* Cibo *cough*).  I was surprised that Brick is where Pizzeria Uno used to be at Arizona Center.  Our first clue about its mediocrity should have been that this place was deserted on a Saturday night.  There were maybe four occupied tables when we got there around 6:30.  Even when we left around 8:00 it was still empty.  We had the hummus plate as an appetizer and it was mediocre.  Honestly it tasted like chick peas that had been run through the food processor with no other flavors added to it.  There's only one pita on the platter, and they actually charged us for an extra one when we asked.  The cheese plate we had was pretty awesome and definitely worth the money.  The pizza was just okay.  We had the one topped with pork belly, smoked salmon, and a fried egg.  It was definitely a new twist on pizza, but it wasn't anything to write home about.  Then of course after all was said and done we had to pay for parking, even after having it validated.  The Arizona Center just isn't worth it.  All in all, Brick was fine with the Groupon but I don't think I'd pay full price for it.

We had an upstairs toilet that would cause water to leak out a light fixture in our kitchen downstairs whenever the toilet was flushed.  One plumber I called was concerned it would be a bigger issue and recommended I call Jason in case it was.  He came out the same afternoon that I called.  He did a great job repairing, was very quick and efficient, and I was impressed that the price was so reasonable.  Glad to have a plumber to call on when I need one in the future!

So excited to have a good sit-down option in Laveen where I can take my kids and have a nice, family dinner.  We've been two times since it opened, including opening night.  I've been pleased with the quality of service and the food each time.  I've always liked Barro's Pizza, and I'm glad there's a local option now instead of just national chains.  I was also beyond pleased at their prices.  We'll definitely enjoy having this Barro's so close!

I wanted to share my SUPREME disappointment with my visit to Southern Rail restaurant last night.  I had been excited to visit since I first heard of the Newton project and another Justin Beckett restaurant in Phoenix, as my husband and I love Beckett's Table.  We have two young children, and it's not very often we get a date night out to enjoy a dinner just the two of us.  When the opportunity presented itself yesterday, we were so excited to try out Southern Rail.  Great wine list--featuring one of our all-time favorite wines (The Franc)--great menu...it was idyllic.    We decided to start with sharing a gumbo appetizer while we figured out what our actual meal would be.  It arrived quickly, which was nice, but I have never been as disappointed in a dish served to me at a restaurant as I was with that gumbo. I presume Chef Beckett knows what a roux is, but this gumbo was completely lacking a roux as its base.  This gumbo tasted like brown water with some chunks of chicken and sausage thrown into it with a scoop of rice.  My husband grew up in New Orleans, and his Cajun aunt taught me how to make a proper roux and gumbo.  If I order gumbo at a restaurant, I expect it to be better than what I can make at home (which is pretty tasty if I do say so myself) or at the very least to have a decent roux, and to say this gumbo was disappointing doesn't even scratch the surface.  We sent the gumbo back (I have never before sent back a dish), finished our wine, and left.  It wasn't worth even trying anything else on the menu, wasting precious date night time or money!    I really hope this was just some kind of weird fluke and that the entire menu isn't as completely lackluster as the gumbo, but I won't be back to give it another shot.
