I also would like to tell people don't take your car to Fletchers on chandler and 40th st. I posted earlier about the rude treatment at Greulich,  while I was treated nicely at fletchers they charged me a fortune for parts that a real mechanic said would rarely all go bad at the same time.  I had my egr replaced on Monday by my boyfriend and when we took it to fletchers they said it was defective and they gave me a hard time about giving me the egr we just put in so I could take back to O'Reilly,  they put in a factory piece that cost 2x as much, and when they showed us the egr, it was clearly broken but it wasn't that way 2 days earlier. I feel they were on a fishing expedition on my dime and when I picked it up it ran worse than it did when I took it there and a new code came up, they said you need a new fuel pump which was replaced 2 weeks ago, I asked if that was the problem why didn't the code come up then, he said I don't know but maybe you should replace spark plugs. Don't you think that would have been the first thing they did instead they replaced every sensor which cost me almost $1000, they are crooks I am reporting them to the better business Bureau

The view is absolutely amazing, get there at sunset it is breathtaking. The eggplant bisque was beyond delicious and they even gave me the recipe. The seared scallops with squash succotash and peas was to die for. It was definitely a return venue for me.
