I haven't really gone bowling much so I don't have any previous experiences to judge this against. Anyway! I had a lot of fun. We didn't arrive during the unlimited time slot unfortunately. We paid about $9 for one hour ($14 if we wanted two). We put in a reservation for two lanes and got them pretty quick. Wahoo! Even though we had to wait a bit longer for the rest of our party to arrive, there were no problems getting our lanes and our full hour.  The facility was clean and cool, and the lounge/game areas provided that neat arcade atmosphere that I always enjoy. They had a good selection of bowling balls of varying finger sizes and weight. The smaller sizes seemed a bit sparse, though, so best claim your ball while you can! Also, the scoring TV had some pretty funny sequences, so that provided us with a few chuckles.  There were a few minor quibbles. In the beginning, our lane neighbors had a party of 20 or something and awkwardly kept putting their bowling balls in our holding area. They eventually stopped, so no staff intervention was needed. Our balls also got stuck in the back of the pin area, but we were given 15 minutes in compensation for the wait time. So that was good!  If I was invited to a bowling outing again to this location, I would not be averse to it!

The game selection is not too bad. They have a lot of rhythm games, and they're handily bunched together in a room. Overall, though, the games are quite pricey, and certain machines keep breaking down. To be fair, I've put on an extra star for the games since I do find a good amount of them enjoyable. The customer service is deplorable, though.  I want to bring up a few points about the staff. These events have really soured my experience with this location. Normally when I go to Gameworks, I play a few games and everything is fine. However, on two occasions, the staff has been incredibly rude. One night, one of the staff yelled racial slurs at that group out of nowhere. We called upon his manager to get an apology, but the offender only claimed that it was an accident that he yelled out all those words. It was definitely no accident as he tailed our group to the outside of the building and shouted those words.  On a second occasion, after playing a few games with our group, my sister and I sat down and took a break at one of their tables for a few minutes. One of the employees came over and said they were watching us the entire time, and that if we did not play any games, they would ask us to leave the establishment. It is odd that they have been watching us, and it is odd because we HAD been playing games, albeit not as many as the others. I will note that we are Asian and post-college, but we dress and act like any other American women, so I have no idea why we were treated this way.  Despite all this, Gameworks can be a place for a fun outing depending on who is on staff at the moment. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning to this location again.  NOTE ADDED 5/15/13:  Below it seems like a representative of Gameworks offered a way to contact me in regards to my experience. In actuality, no follow up was offered. I emailed him shortly after he left that message, but I received no response in return, so my rating still stands.

This mom-and-pop restaurant is one of my partner's and my favorite places to eat when going out. The food is prepared quickly, and it tastes delicious! The price isn't bad, especially considering how much food they put on the plate.   I usually cycle between the original gyro and the chicken pita. You can choose either a salad or fries as your side. I personally choose the fries, since I'm not a big fan of their salad.  The gyro itself has lots of meat layered inside as well as a tasty sauce mixed with onions. The pita bread they use is great, too. Thick bread and holds the food contents well, just how I like it!  The only downside I can think of that affected me was that I didn't like the taste of the water very much. It's not that big of a deal if you're a soda drinker, though.  One more thing! They have a large TV that displays sports, so if you want to watch a game while having dinner out, it's not a bad place to be. I was able to catch the semi-final soccer game thanks to them.  If you're ever around downtown Mesa for an event or convention, I'd highly recommend eating here! Affordable, quick, and satisfying!

"Eh" would be the one word I'd choose to describe it.   One immediate downside is that the place is cash only. As someone who almost never carries cash, it took me months before I was able to try this place.  Seating is outdoors with a view of the light rail construction.  Eating there and not to-go was a bit of a bummer because there were tons of flies zipping around us and our food.   My partner tried the fish and chips. The fish, he said, tasted like average fish sticks that you'd buy from a grocery store. I tried the fries; they were pretty underwhelming, but eatable. I ordered the burger. It wasn't very flavorful, but it did its job to make me full. I've eaten better burgers elsewhere that were cheaper, though.   Would I eat here again? Ehhhhhh.

First time here. Came in with my partner. Staff was friendly enough, but not entirely helpful when it came to the menu. Partner approached counter to order for us and was confused about the pick 2 option (he thought the three options denoted the sizes of small, medium, and large, and was thrown off by the fact that pick 2 was cheaper than a half sandwich and misread the sign), but no one wanted to answer his question. To echo someone else's review on this page, they just sort of stared at him.   Still confused, and wanting to be able to share with me and eat now because we were starving, he ended up getting a full sized steak and cheese panini. That was a mistake. It was basically bread. $9 for bread with almost nothing inside it. The meat inside was reduced to a teeny, thin slice in each half of the sandwich. It was so tiny it barely covered half of a half sandwich. My stomach cried; why not cover the whole bread? Is there a meat shortage? If I could describe its thickness, I would say it was maybe the thickness of a house key or two? I was just flabbergasted that for a $9ish sandwich, they were so stingy on the meat. It was a nearly empty, lonely set of bread slices. The skinny slab of meat did taste fine, but we left hungry and unsatisfied.   I forgot to mention-- they pushed a buy one, get one free cookie deal on him, but failed to mention that the meal already comes with a cookie. I know that is a given to people who've already gone to Paradise, but we didn't know? Well, for all those who love cookies, you might still be able to take advantage of the deal if it's still going on.  I do want to add-- there was a man there who I had separately ordered a smoothie from, and he was very nice and helpful. He took my order and brought the smoothie directly to me. The smoothie was tasty and helped me refocus on my work.  Anyway, I wonder if my feelings would be different if a different sandwich was chosen. If I ever return again, we will see.

My partner and I discovered Niki's Kitchen in February through a groupon and chose to visit the restaurant for a Valentine's day lunch. I've only eaten fry-bread at the Tucson Meet Yourself festival and at carnivals, so this was my first time eating one at a restaurant.  I ordered a red chili fry-bread that was decked out with all the offered veggies and toppings. My partner ordered something that was akin to a Philly cheese steak in fry-bread form. My dish had a very fresh feeling and was quite tasty. The Philly fry-bread was chock full of flavor. I preferred the juicy taste of the Philly, but both dishes were quite good. I'd also like to mention that the portions were large, so I was able to take some of my leftovers home to enjoy later.  The interior itself was very homey and inviting. We were greeted warmly, so I felt very welcome. The dishes were brought out to us in a timely manner, and we were asked a few times about anything we might have needed.   Suffice it to say, it was a good experience and given the opportunity, I would gladly go again.

I tried out Urban Picnic yesterday with a friend after looking up nearby places to eat on Yelp. It was enjoyable! I took some other Yelpers' advice and tried the roasted turkey/stuffing sandwich and the roast beef sandwich for my friend. We also had sides added-- macaroni and a bean pasta. The macaroni was still a bit hot, but it was delicious after it cooled down. I particularly loved my sandwich. It was Thanksgiving in May for me. Surprisingly, I only finished 1/4th of it due to its large portions. Which is a good thing in my book! I got to take it home and finish it as a good dinner.  I took some bites of the roast beef sandwich, and it's definitely good for people who like a kick in their flavor. I also gave the lavender infused lemonade a shot. It was delicious! It definitely had a hint of lavender flavor which I did not expect to taste so good. I loved that it was sweet, but those who don't like sweet drinks should be mindful of that. They also offered peach green tea, which I may try next time.  We also tried the Green Smoothie, which--if I can recall correctly--consisted of spinach, bananas, and peanut butter. To be honest, the peanut butter made the smoothie odd so I let my friend finish it after I took a sip. He actually didn't like it much either. It was the new June special and was not on their normal menu (meaning it was an experiment probably?), so I'm sure their regular fruit smoothies tasted fine.  In terms of service-- great! The man at the cashier was very pleasant and checked up on us a few times. I wish the prices were a little bit cheaper, but I did like the food.   Forgot to mention-- the to-go box and the "plates" that are items were brought out on definitely made me think of picnics. They had nice, modern furniture in bright colors that added a hip feel to the place. I loved their cute little plant directions on their table as well as the "grass" on the wall. A cute, urban atmosphere! I'd definitely go again given the chance.

This is probably one of my favorite go-to places in Mesa. Open till 10pm and always welcoming you with a smile. And the food is great! Affordable, tasty, and so many options! I'm obsessed with their daily special carne asada burrito and their chicken spinach enchiladas. If I ever come here after a bad day, after that first bite into my meal, it's wiped away.  Also, the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff is a HUGE plus for me. On a few occasions I'd arrived with a big group, so we had to sit at one of the outside tables. Even though they were busy, they kindly brought our food out to us.  Sometimes the line to order is long (since so many people love their food), but once your order is taken, service is quick. The atmosphere inside is cute and colorful, and the strung lights on the patio give it a relaxing, almost festive vibe. They have a salsa bar with some other add-ons, such as limes, if you so need.   If you're ever in the Mesa area, considering stopping by Taquitos Jalisco! I know I'll be.

Direct Buy and Sears Vacation. Seemingly two random companies, but they are actually partnered together in Scottsdale. They double teamed at a veteran event I attended to scam people together. After doing further research on both these shady companies, I feel that it is my civic duty to warn people. I will write a separate review about Sears Vacation, but for now, this one is about Direct Buy and their practices.  My experience with this company occurred on the 8th of November after the Veterans parade. From what I've observed after watching them after they approached me, they seem to target gullible-looking, timid young women who are alone (even those that are possibly underage) as well as older veterans.   At around 1:00 PM, I was minding my own business and checking out the front of a bookstore when I was cornered by two men in black shirts--one from Direct Buy and one from Sears Vacation. I did not approach them. I was in the middle of taking a picture of the bookstore's cowboy poster when they both sneaked up intimidatingly close behind me. Frightened, I jumped. They were extremely pushy and blocked off my way of escape. They quickly mentioned that they were doing a raffle, but instead of asking if I even wanted to join it, they started pummeling me for information, blocking my exit when I'd turn. They were very insistent on getting my full name, phone number, email, and zip code before letting me leave. They had me blocked between an outdoor table and a bookshelf. Since their cornering made me feel imbalanced and frightened, I gave them information to get them to stop interrogating me and let me go. Big mistake. I immediately felt sick to my stomach after this. In hindsight I wish I screamed for help or was quick enough to give them fake information. Most of all I wish I could have just screamed no, I'm not interested in your raffle. Because I wasn't! I just wanted them to leave me alone.  I walked further downtown, and then got harangued by ANOTHER Direct Buy community marketer. I told him I already gave up my information to the employees down there, but he wouldn't believe me. He followed me a ways and yelled after me in a mocking tone. Is this acceptable behavior at a veterans' event?  I go home later and look up both companies online. BOTH are known as scams. It's not a real raffle. It's an aggressive marketing ploy with trickery in the fine print and their practices. They get your information, call you an obscene amount of times, and once they get you on the line, insist that to get your "free" item, you need to come in for a 2 hour presentation, What you don't know is that it is a pressure sale. Yes, a pressure sale. You are ONLY able to get your "free" item if you sign up for their $5000 club right there and then. They know that if you go home without signing your hard-earned cash away in their presence, they've lost you as a target. They say you can cancel within three days, but if you just google any consumer complaints about the company, it is nigh impossible save getting your credit card company involved with a charge back and fighting the club for months. They claim to offer good deals, but from what I've researched, it's actually untrue. You'd save more money buying elsewhere. Besides, how can you make a sound of mind choice if they pressure you and say this is your only chance, and you're a fool for walking away? Take my advice. If you are considering this company at all, please google consumer complaints about Direct Buy.   Why should I do business with a company that harassed me into giving them my personal information? They are known for lack of transparency and aggressive, predatory tactics. Do not give up any information to this company. Again, they use bully tactics to get this information from people who look vulnerable. And ESPECIALLY do not give them any money. You will not get anything out of it, and you may not see it again.  Save yourself some heartache. If you see or hear either of these company names, RUN. I implore you, do not be fooled.  If they attempt to harass me again and fail to put me on their do-no-call list, not only will I update this review, but I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau and the FTC to report their awful business practices.  EDIT 11-12-14// They've begun their spam calling spree. Called me three times so far today (two from Directbuy, one from Sears Vacation). When I pick up, it's silence and then a hangup. When you call back, you don't get a rep but instead a voicemail to leave your phone number (HA) so they can sign you up for an appointment for their pressure sales. I've confirmed both voicemails exhibit the same woman in the beginning for both companies' voicemails.  Here are the phone numbers to watch out for: 800-571-4964 and 866-707-8417

Came here after visiting a friend's art show in the area. Aside from the charming decor, the highlight of this place for me would be the staff affability. The hostess, waiter, and even our cook were all incredibly nice. They were good with menu recommendations, casual conversation, and even personalized my sister's soup with a cute smiley face. She got what was on the blackboard, which I think was a barbecue brisket sandwich. It was a very good sandwich! I nibbled off her plate and wished it was mine. I had gotten the cheese curds since I wasn't hungry enough for my own full meal, and my partner got a chicken cobb salad. All three of us were satisfied with our meals.  For a frame of reference, last time I was there, prices were around the $8-$12 mark depending on what you want. They also offer donuts and such for snacks.   Good experience!

I've been here twice. The first visit was positive since it was a major event night that attracted a large crowd of enthusiastic people. I ordered deep fried mushrooms, which were decent but a little burnt and a tad expensive. There was a lingering smell of gamer odor in the air, but any unpleasantness was offset by the friendly female staff and some of the strangers I gamed with.  My second visit erased every positive feeling I had about Endgame. I organized a night with a group to visit the venue and planned on snacking and playing some games. My night there was cut short by the overt rudeness of the bald, preening host with the stud earrings. As we entered, we were greeted by his unwelcoming scowl. He was already directing a scornful look at another person in the lobby, which I should've taken as a warning sign. A quick look around and I also realized the place was awfully empty and a little dirty on the floor and tables, and that this might be what it's usually like here on a typical, non-event night.  Wristbands are a requirement if you're consuming alcohol or staying after 10, but I would be leaving at 9:30, and I don't drink for personal reasons. When asked, I told him I wouldn't be drinking, but he ignored my words and shifted his scowl towards me. Long story short, he was incredibly rude about the situation, treated me as if I was a preteen with a fake I.D., and ignored every word I said just so that he could continue his incivility. You let a little 5 year old girl into the bar area. Did you give her a hard time as well and also make comments to other patrons on her skirt? I go to quickly seat myself only to find out from my company that he continued on to badmouth me once I was out of earshot. Professionalism at its finest.  Later on, when I go to step outside for a moment, he's glaring at me. That's enough for this gal. I'm not going to spend the whole night with a seething host breathing down my neck. I left and ate elsewhere on Mill.  TLDR I organized a group together to game and eat grub at Endgame, but after my recent experience with the rude, unfriendly host, that'll never be happening again. I might be willing to forgive meh food or atmosphere, but discourteous staff is where I draw the line.
