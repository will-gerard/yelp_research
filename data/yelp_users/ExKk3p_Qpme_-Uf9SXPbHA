I've only been here once but I had a great experience here. They were actually out of the chai tea that I wanted so the barista recommended a different kind of chai tea for me and I ended up loving it. Definitely will stop back in here if I'm in the area again and need some caffeine!

Service was pretty slow when I went. It took a while to get drinks and food. I got the Mac and cheese which was mediocre at best. It is a neat environment though so I really liked the atmosphere. Just wished the food and the service was better.

Came here because I had seen good reviews for it and was craving sushi. This place definitely did the trick! The sushi was extremely fresh and was a great price since we came during happy hour! I will definitely be back here if I'm in the area! I was not able to find a full menu online but when I got the the restaurant they had a lot of options for sushi rolls.  The atmosphere is nice and or server was attentive.
