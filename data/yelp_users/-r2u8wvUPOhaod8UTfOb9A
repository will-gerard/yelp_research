They were pretty awesome! We bought our home a month ago, and this was a first time ever having an issue and having to use a home warranty. Late friday night we had a small accident our garage door came off the railing and almost fell on our truck, leaving the truck stuck in the garage without us being able to drive out. Our home warranty dispatched these guys, and even though their office was closed on the weekends they were able to still send someone out to us on saturday morning. I made a follow up call to hung rite early saturday morning to find out what time they were coming out, the lady informed me it will probably be on monday since their offices are closed on the weekends and they will not receive the dispatched order until monday. I told her that wouldn't work out for me since my truck is pretty much stuck in the garage, and the door is hanging halfway open. She quickly started working on a resolution for me, said she will work something out and call me right back. A few hours later their guy showed up and quickly repaired everything. Even though most of it was not covered by the home warranty he still gave us a reasonable price for the repairs. Way less than we prepared ourselves to pay. Overall they are great. I def. recommend them

Absolutely love love this place. The food is good, drink specials and service is always great. We come here once a month, the location is perfect with views of the water from the patio! They also have specials if you use foursquare you can get $ off your bill.

If I could rate this a negative number I would. I swear I was being punked. It was like a bad episode in real life. I love Pho and so I looked this place up in a Google search for top 10 pho places in Phoenix. This was a meet up lunch with my girlfriend and her toddler. Myself and my toddler arrived a little earlier we got a table, and I asked for a high chair. They brought the highchair (dirty with grime and sticky stuff all over) no big deal, I had disinfectant wipes. I cleaned it up and sat my kid in it. As I sat down myself, I realized my chair was wet. I immediately stood up and noticed there was a yellow urine like puddle under the table. I told the waiter staff and they just replaced my chair, claiming it was just water spilled. It def smelled bad and it was not water. Whatevs, I went into the restroom and wiped off whatever it was with soap off the back of my jeans. My girlfriend and her kid arrived so they asked for another highchair. Another dirty highchair was brought. I handed her the wipes and she did her thing. We ordered our food, which took a little while Pho Ga (chicken pho) and a sandwich for our kids to split. I tasted my Pho and it was descent, however before I could take a 2nd sip we looked over on the wall by our table and saw a cockroach just passing by like we were in his territory. This is when we got up and walked to the cashier and told them what's up. They thought we were lying or something. I walked them over and pointed at the cockroach. At this point they just started cleaning up the table and muttering something under their breath. That's cool. I walked back to the cashier and his response was "Don't worry it's on me"  .....I paused with silence and had to make sure there were no one jumping out with cameras telling me I was on an episode of some sort of disgusting restaurant joke. The most horrible restaurant experience ever.

Old Wendy's building, taken over. Anyway, their gyros taste good. Having a drive through and specials is a plus. Fries could use some changing though, those crinkle cut frozen kind  taste old. The Chicago hot dog is amazing though. Haven't tried the burger here, but husband has and he said it was ok.

Best salted pepper chicken hands down! It's hard to find a place that has salted pepper chicken on the menu in AZ. This is it! I love love love the cripsy chicken and it goes perfect with fried rice or chow mein. Swtich it up once in a while and get Orange chicken, but salted pepper is my favorite here! DELISH!

the worst. Employees and owner just do not care about the customers and how they appear. The employees are outside smoking every few minutes. We waited for our to go order for 15 minutes, during that time the guy out of the kitchen went out for a cigarrette 3 times. We were also ripped off. They charged us for what we ordered to go, but did not give us all the food that we ordered. Also they overchardged us, since they had to substitute for something that cost less, they were out of beef. The plate we originally ordered was $9.99 what they charged us, but since they were out ( which they told us after we  waited for our order ) they gave us plates that are cheaper on the menu and did not offer a refund. On top of all that we ordered babaganuj, but when got home it wasnt put in with our order. Upon leaving we saw their kitchen staff with some other suspect characters outside arguing and smoking. At one point it even looked like the guy from the kitchen went outside and peed on the wall. Very turned off by this place. This is my firrst and last time I will get food from here. I lost my apetite, but the 2 others that were with me that ate their food when we got home said it was dry and overcooked. I called the owner and expressed how he charged me for items that I ordered and they werent included, and the fact that their substitute items cost less than what I paid for. He gave me a bunch of excuses and blamed it on the girl that was handling my order and she forgot to include babaganuj. He asked me to come back and get my babaganuj. Everything was wrong with this place.  No thanks.

I stoped in on a rainy day and tried their 3 meat lunch special which consisted of basmati rice, greek salad, chicken kabob, kufteh kabob and gyro meat. A lot of food great price and sooooooo tasty. While I waited for a few minutes for the food to be cooked the lady offered me a bowl of hot soup on the house. It was one of the best lentil soup bowls I have ever had! It was absolutely delish! Hubs tried their babaganuj and fell in love. This place is down the street from our new house and we love it. The people who run it are really nice too.

The worst experience ever. I gave this place 2 chances and both were fails. The first time a few people I work with got together called in an order for 8 individual meals, we were quoted a price. When we got there to pick up our food and pay we got charged an amount $20 more than we got a quote. They make mistakes, it was fine we paid the $20 extra and got our food. The food was mediocre, the chicken was dry the rice was over-cooked; the salads only have a pinch of feta cheese looks nothing like in the picture.  I gave this place another chance, thought I'd go and try something else off the menu thinking it would be different this time around. I called ahead at 10:30am during their business hours no one answered. I didn't even get to order my food,  when arrived at 10:45am the doors were locked and I saw a young lady mopping the floors. I knocked on the door to get her attention; she turned and asked another girl behind the counter if they are open yet. The sign on the door says they open at 10:30am. Umm hello? So the girl from behind the counter comes and unlocks the door and says they can't let anyone in and lock the door while they mop the floor. Interesting? No "Caution wet floor" signs? She gets an attitude rolls her eyes and tells me "We're closed you can wait until the floor dries then we'll let you in."   I don't know about you, but I don't have time to wait on my lunch for their floors to dry in front of a locked door, during business hours. I'm so done with this place. They won't get any more business from me or my co workers.

Jerk Chicken! Not for the faint-hearted. I ordered over the phone after reading some of the good reviews on different sites. Jerk Chicken plate for myself and Oxtail plate for my hubs. We also got sides of Aloo pies, plantains, doubles and Pholorie. Had to get the Solo sodas! We missed trini food from when we used to live in Queens New York, this def made up for it! The lady was so nice she threw in a double with pepper on the house for us to try! Everything was delish, we even had left overs for the next day. My 1 year old went to town on aloo pie. The fam loved it! Definitely coming back to this place again.  This may be a small hole in the wall place, but the food is #amaze!

My kid had a superhero themed 2nd birthday here. Absolutely love the place and the instructor and trainee was awesome. We were able to schedule 2 weeks ahead and they were able to fit us in. Thank you for making a time slot available for us at last minute. The activities were great, all the kids had so much fun singing, playing and dancing around. This place rocks and you don't have to worry about cleaning up afterwards. They keep the food and drinks in a separate room. Kids played danced followed by food and cake, followed by more playing and activities which was perfect for us. At the end each kid was given a goody bag with bubbles, beach ball and other cool kid friendly items. Overall it was a great birthday and other parents thought so as well, and will make plans to have a birthday party there for their kids too.
