Sorry guys, but 3.5 hours spent waiting for food that was borderline mediocre simply isn't acceptable. I realize it was Christmas and you were obviously overwhelmed, but our first experience there did not leave a good impression at all. I simply hope we caught you on a bad night.

Such a great place for comfort food. The fried chicken is an excellent southern rendition and vibe is good. I always order the Lo Lo's, which is 3 pieces of chicken prepared southern style, with 2 golden waffles... and it's plenty for me. The 'dranks' come in big mason jars are usually don't need to be refilled. It's a team service event and it's always on-point. Mama has done good!  Certainly going back.

She really does an amazing job with all of the dishes offered.   After trying dozens of different Chinese restaurants around the Phoenix valley, this one is my favorite. It's kind of a hidden gem, which probably explains why I didn't find it sooner. The dining area is very clean and modern, the service is swift and friendly, and the food is absolutely wonderful. I always look forward to returning!  Thank you for feeding Phoenix!

It goes almost without saying, that for a brewpub... Four Peaks has it down. Food menu, beer pairings, and service is always consistent and very good.

San Tan Brewing offered my party of four a great experience. We showed up without reservations on a Saturday night around 7:30pm. There was a short wait and we were told it was about 40-45 minutes. We waited about 20 minutes or so and was then seated. Our server (Virva) greeted us with a welcoming smile and asked us for our drink order right away.  The menu offered an excellent variety to chose from and I was told that everything is made in-house, from their dressings, sauces, brews (obviously), and so on. Each of us ended up order different beer and different style burgers, all in which were absolutely fantastic. The food runners were speedy and accurate and the bus boys were prompt and polite.  For a happening crowd and experience w/ great beer and very good food... I recommend San Tan Brewing to anybody in the area. Great job guys, keep it up!

Great place! I stop in probably once a week for the soulvaki chicken pita and falafels. A very legit place and far better than any other place in the Phoenix area.

Decent place. I'm guessing it's better to go during the week vs. the weekend as with most breakfast places, the service and quality go downhill during peak volumes. The menu is what pulled us in, as it really looked great. The  food on the visit was good but the service was not. What really did it in for me was when the bus staff removed my plate before I was done, as well has very aggressively cleared the table next to us that we couldn't hear ourselves think. Again, the food was good but not excellent and the service makes it less than desirable to want to return.

Very cool little place. My first visit was a week ago and returned again today for a late lunch/happy hour. Menu selection is very good (I ordered the BLT w/ avocado) and the service is very nice. I will be visiting again soon.

This place is a hidden gem. Great little intimate place with a casual atmosphere. Yes, it's on the border of a shady area in-town but have never had any problems. Food is very good and service is always excellent.

What's not to love about Postinos? Brunches, Lunches, and Happy Hours... all excellent. I always request Jennifer when I stop in on Monday and Tuesday nights and always enjoy my lunch breaks there. It's a great little gem in the midtown/central corridor. Certainly going back!

What's there not to like about this place. The sushi is amazing and the service is great. The atmosphere at the sushi bar is always fun... and the beautiful crowd helps too! ;)

I've lived in this neighborhood for a few years now and I really want to like this place. Used to try it out almost once a week. Outside of the pizza, the consistency of food is very unpredictable. And unless you already know who to request as your server, again... roll the dice. And the management/shift supervisors... forget it. The last three times I I dined-in, I was appalled at how they treated the staff. Whistles like dogs and finger snaps like, well... I'll refrain from how I'll state that here. I'm sorry guys, but I won't be coming back anytime soon.

Absolutely on-point! A way a barber experience should be. Matt (owner/barber) has done a great job in knowing his clientele as well as providing near perfect haircuts for men. He runs a solo show so sometimes the wait is 20-40 minutes but I've learned to plan for it; it's also a great time to take a breathe to relax. Super neat place... nothing else like it. (It's almost a catch 22 to rave about this place as I don't want everybody else potentially eating up my chair time but it would be selfish of me and the parlor deserves the credit!)

Pulled pork is to die for. Excellent brisket and wonderful smoked turkey. Great mess hall atmosphere and the price is right!

Usually not a fan of chains (Z'Tejas), as I try to keep my business with locally owned organizations but  happy I checked out Taco Guild. Super neat space and great ambiance. The food and drink menus are excellent and the service has always been very good. Happy hour is also a nice treat.

Great place! Always busy and the food and service are always excellent!   I typically just order the three egg breakfast with bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice. Never disappointed.

After 4 years, I found this to be the best place for pizza. Service is fantastic, and the food is amazing. The fire pizza oven chars the crust just a tiny amount to give it an excellent flavor. Sauce, crust... spot on. Happy to have them here in Phoenix!

Anybody who knows what a Detroit Coney Dog tastes likes... needs to check this place out. I've been out here for years and now for finally found the right place. David (owner) welcomes all as family. A little slice of home... here in the valley!

This 2nd location of Matt's Phoenix Barber Parlor is an excellent representation of his original Barber Parlor brand. After two+ years of excellent service with Matt, I found this location and barber, Zakk, to be my go-to for my haircuts and beard trims... my personal favorite in all of the Phoenix metro area. Thank you again, Zakk, keep up the awesome work!

Cool, new place. Went here for the first time for a friend's birthday gathering. Plenty of space, good food and drinks, excellent waitstaff, and an awesome location. Reminds me of being up north on lake. We will be visiting again.

They've done an excellent job with the restaurant. First time visiting and we will returning soon. Drink menu is very good with a nice variety of bourbons and scotches. Small plate selection is also very good. We ordered the tomato, onion, and bacon tart -- along with the fried green tomatoes, both were excellent! For our entrees we ordered the gumbo and pork tenderloin... absolutely amazing!   Service was handled by Chris who was very friendly, relaxed, and knew the menu. I don't usually make note of waitstaff by name for future reference but he left a lasting impression and will certainly ask for him the next time we visit.   Thank you to everybody for an excellent dinner!
