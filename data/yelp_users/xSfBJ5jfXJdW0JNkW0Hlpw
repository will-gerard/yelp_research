We love All Creatures!   Dr Bob has always been very helpful, thorough, and never made us feel rushed. I'm a relatively new client (only been in a couple of times), but he remembered us (and my parents, who I sent in with their new puppy), which I love because we were never treated like "just another number".   The front desk staff is always pleasant, booking an appointment is super easy, and they can usually get you in right away.   I've recommended this facility to a couple of my clients (I'm a dog trainer), and they have all loved All Creatures as well!

Over 5 mins to get seated, 5 mins for drinks, 20 mins later, no one even took our order. Only 4 tables in the whole restaurant! We have a baby and a three year old, and they wasted all the time we would've had to have a family dinner, so we left.

No wonder why my doctor does not care enough to give good patient care or to listen to my concerns. he's the only one covered under my health insurance, and I'm not allowed to change doctors within the facility so now I'm stuck with him. awesome!

Good food, no complaints.  I was suprised though that half of the items offered weren't Chinese at all (fruit, pudding, dessert, fries...) I was a little disappointed that it cost us over $6 for my three year old to eat some fruit and a bowl of ice cream,  but oh well. I would come back,  just without the kids.

We love the Play Factory!   We come here all the time with my 3 year old and 8 month old. It's nice that they have a smaller children's area where she can crawl around safely while my son can burn off tons of energy without burning himself on the scorching park playgrounds.   This place is always clean, they keep the air down low, and if you go on Toddler Tuesdays/Thursdays (half off), it's an affordable way to keep your kids busy.   My only complaint is the lack of seating within visual range of the bigger play area, and the fact that you can't bring your own snacks. I know that they want to make money off of the crackers and cookies, but I prefer to bring my son fresh fruit or a sandwich so he doesn't come home with a sugar high.   Groupon always has great summer deals, we just purchased an unlimited month for $19, so check them for deals too.

Amending my previous review.  Love their burgers so when my in laws were in town, we took them and the kids out to eat here. Tiny restaurant, 100 degrees inside, bland burger tonight,  but that's ok. What made me upset was horrible customer service.  The wobbly table got knocked, and my kindergartener's water bottle spilled (ever hear of cups with lids?)  Well my husband said he would clean it up and then some old guy who worked there said "shit" and left to get a mop.  When I was returning from the bathroom wth my toddler, he just about ran her over in anger.    I left without finishing.  I understand if your restaurant is tiny and you don't have adequate seating, but no need to have an attitude with your customers!   I won't be returning.

First time here. Unfortunately I will not be back. Since it was our first time, my husband and I decided to play it safe by ordering the pre made bowls. I got the honey walnut chicken and he got the mandarin orange. Mine was bland, burnt and the veggies raw. I could only eat a few bites. I tried his, and it tasted like frozen orange juice mix. They offered to replace my bowl, but I didn't want anything else. At least the alcohol was good.

I made an appt with Dr. Alejandro after being recommended by a friend. I have several auto immune disorders, and in general, feel like crap all the time. Every other Dr I've seen has given me 15 mins to describe my symptoms and decide which pill I wanted to try next. Dr. Alejandro spent almost THREE HOURS with me. We talked about everything, my full medical history, my stress, my diet, etc. We discussed treatment plans and supplements I need to detox my body and help support my immune system so my body can do what it was designed to do: heal and take care of itself.  She was so nice, and very knowledgeable. I just started the program, and am already noticing some benefits. I know I have a long journey ahead - my body needs time to heal and grow stronger, so I will update my review in a couple of months.

I called 6 times over 2 hours before someone answered to make an appointment. The woman on the phone (Erin?) sounded so annoyed by my call. Nonetheless I made an appointment.  Finding the place was a challenge, but I pulled up, unbuckled my 7 month old and 3 year old in the hot sun and walked up to the front door. Locked. What?   I called and the guy said "Oh the entrance is in the back, just drive to the back of the building and park there," as if I was supposed to already know. There isn't even a sign on the front saying that the entrance is in the back.   Anyway, I re-buckle my (now crying) children, and drive to the back of the building. There isn't a sign as to which door is theirs, so I call again. He said it was the one with the screen door, I thank him, and say I'll be inside shortly. I unbuckle the troops again, and we walk up to the door. It's locked too! I can hear someone inside so I bang on the door and wait. Nothing. I tried the doors to the right and left of the screened one, locked too. I banged on the screen door again, because I can still hear someone on the other side. Nothing. By now my 7 month old is sweaty and crying. Did I mention it was 2pm and 104 degrees out today!?  I got all of my children back into the car (again!), and I called to cancel my appointment as I drove away. I told him that having no signs and all of your doors locked is THE best way to lose customers. Not once did he apologize for it being so damn difficult to just get into the building.   I only drove all the way down here because we are in between insurances, because my husband started a new job. I have no idea how they are medically, but I will wait until we have insurance again to go to a REAL business.

Amey is AMAZING. She saved my breast feeding relationship! She gave me support during that very emotional first week, and helped me get through some very challenging obstacles, as my baby was born with a short tongue and couldn't latch correctly most times, which led to painful blisters. She's also helped a friend of mine, and I would highly recommend her to anyone!
