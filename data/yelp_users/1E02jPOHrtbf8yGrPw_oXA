I was there for a total of four months. It was so horrid my gf and I broke the lease. Our downstairs neighbors wife was stalking my gf's 15 year old daughter. Verbally berating her and other ongoings. Leasing office did not want anything to do with it and wouldnt get involved. The maintenance crew there leaves much than do be desired. Air went out at 1:30am and they basically told us to deal with it (it was 107 outside) after threatening to go to fair housing and the state they finally came out.  Basically they want your money but if you have issues with your apt or another resident thwy could care less. I feel sorry for anyone who moves in here. Really nice apartments with very shitty managment. But don't take my word for it. Im just some random guy on the internet.........,

Best juice in the valley is what I have to say. The staff is always super friendly and overly knowledgeable. I Have been buying from Butt Out for the last several months and have never had a bad experience with them. This is not a shop that wants you to be in and then out. They encourage patrons to hang out and meet other like minded people. The atmosphere there is always amazing. Do yourself a favor an treat yourself to a whole new vaping experience you wont regret it.

As an avid costomer of Butt Out and also after seeing the good reviews I went to check this place out. I walked in and was greeted by two ladies once of witch did not even no what size carto went in my tank (i had to correct her) the other woman was very nice. The older gentleman who im presuming is either the owner or manager showed an overall disinterest in me and my money. It was very off putting. The only reason im giving this review two stars is because I was hungry and they had a vending machine inside.

I went there for the first time the other day. Upon walking into the place was greeted bt a blonde female (she was really nice). None of the other employees seemed to really care about anything.  After my juice was made then everyone was in a rush to ring me up and get me and other people out of there. With the exeption of the woman who helped me everything else was a very unpleasant feeling almost like they were annoyed that they actually had to do a little work. I wont be going back there. Freshop vapor on scotssdale road and mcdowell treats you way better. Same quality juice at a better price. The only benefit to red star is the blond girl they have working there. Total sweetheart!

Nice selection of juices. The people here are very friendly. I very rarely give 5 stars to any business.

I have been to every vape shop in Phoenix and the surrounding areas. Every time one opens I go and check it out. No one can compare to Butt Out's pricing and the quality of their liquids are absolutely unbeatable. They also make all their own liquid. For you non nicotine people who just want the hooka like experience they also offer nicotine free liquids in all flavors. The atmosphere is very relaxed. Your encouraged to hang out unlike other vape shops (names withheld to protect the douchey). They also have an ample selection of mods and tanks. The staff is very knowledgeable and down to earth. Weather you have been vaping for a while or have never vaped before and just want to see what its like, these are the people to go to. They are located right next to Rula Bula in the old cactus sports shop.

I can't say enough about butt out. Ive been going there a little after they first opened. The staff is super friendly and overly knowledgable. Upon going there you are always greeted with a smile which is more than most other shops. The juice lines they carry are amazing, and they just released a new one the other week called "7 days" which is absolutely amazing. Unlike other shops the encourage people to become active in the vaping community and also don't mind if you hang out at the shop which most other shops don't want you doing.  Quit accepting quanity over quality and give butt out a try! You won't be sorry!! I am giving this review 5 stars because it is the ONLY vap shope that has fully satisfied my needs and treated me like I was family!

The sound quality at this venue is quite possibly the worste I have ever had to endure. If it wasn't for a band playing here that I haven't seen in 20 years id take off. What a disservice to musicians everywhere. I get better audio out of my stock ford F150 stereo....LITERALLY.
