Some friends of ours brought us to this place a few days ago.  The food was amazing.  We ordered the Phoenix platter for four people, which gave a salad, appetizer, soup, and about four or five different meals....all of which, awesome.  The food was delicious and fast.  The prawn rolls were my favorite.  Looking forward to going back and trying other things.  My friends who brought us here told us that they have tried nearly everything on the menu and haven't had anything bad there....it's all been great.

My fiance and I have been in need of a new mattress for quite some time.  So, instead of spending one more night tossing, turning, and waking up completely stiff, we decided to do something about it today.  We had gone to this location a few weeks prior to do our bed shopping, we found one we liked, but we decided to wait a few weeks to get it.  Originally, I just wanted to get the mattress, but they talked me into getting new box springs, too, which, only made the price go up by $100 - so it wasn't that bad, and the set was still in the price range I was looking at.   Fortunately, they have a few in-house financing options that do NOT require giving out your social security number for credit checks!  This is quite a win-win for me because I am not one who likes to give out my social security number.  Just because I can get something on credit doesn't mean I should.  Out of the two non-credit check options, I chose the one that offered to pay it off in 90 days, and it would be same as cash.  I put down a down payment, the person in the finance department, Jane, was very thorough and went over everything with us. They even offer same-day delivery, and they get rid of your old furniture they're replacing!  The delivery came a lot earlier than I had anticipated, too.  The finance department told us it could be late evening, but I got my new bed around 1:30 in the afternoon, so about three hours after I was in the store.  Definitely coming back here again when I need to replace new furniture!  They were willing to work with me on the payments, payment schedule, and getting my bed delivered when I want it.  They even said if they didn't have it in stock, they would order one or show me a comparable replacement.  Fortunately for me, the mattress I wanted was in stock so I didn't have to wait.

This was my first time eating at this establishment, and normally, when I write a review, I usually wait until my second visit.  But considering the company has been open since 1963, I figured they are doing something right, so I'll write my review now.  Quite honestly, this was the best Mexican food I've ever had in the Phoenix area.  I love the homemade salsa (not to mention, how MUCH you get - they don't use the tiny bowls for salsa like some restaurants do).  Tonight, I had the carne asada chimichanga, and I have to say that it's probably the best chimichanga I have EVER had.  The tortillas are homemade, and it almost looked like the chimi was pan-fried, because it was over-loaded with grease, which is a definite plus.  It comes with guacamole and sour cream, and I think they kind of over did it with it, but that's my personal preference.  I'm not going to ding them for that.  And the Spanish rice tastes just as it should be - almost like mine.  :)  When we arrived, they were in the middle of their happy hour, where your drinks were half-off.  Bonus!  But if you get regular drinks, such as pop, tea, etc., you get a huge glass for it!  Double bonus.  I know, the little things excite me.  I'll definitely becoming back to this restaurant soon.  I think it's better than Serrano's.  The decor is mediocre, at best, but they make up for it in the food.

My fiance and I met a friend for a birthday party a few days ago, along with 16 other people.  It was my first time visiting this location, or any other one for that matter.  The one thing I was impressed by is that with the amount of people that were there, it wasn't as noisy as I thought it going to be.  Yes, you did have to raise your voice a bit, but it wasn't to the level of shouting, which is a definite plus.  Perhaps it's the high ceilings.  Anyway, my fiance and I opted for the appetizer (mozzarella sticks - you really can't go wrong with those) - they were good, but it's the marinara sauce they give you that make them even better!  My fiance ordered the bison burger, which I had a bite of and thought it was delicious.  My dish, the parmesan crusted chicken, was also quite tasty.  I love the sauce they put on it with the sun-dried tomatoes.    The reason I'm giving this location five stars is simple:   the service.  Our server, Joanna, was amazing.  She was very attentive, but not overly annoying.  After everyone got their food, my dish still hadn't arrived.  She went back to check on it, and apparently, my dish went to another table by mistake, so she had the kitchen rush my dish out and even had the meal compensated without hesitation (I didn't even ask for it).  She was very apologetic and sincere about it, which is rare these days.  There should be more servers like her.  We will definitely be coming back here again.

I have lived in the Phoenix metro area for 2.5 years now, and when I first moved here, I relied heavily on Yelp reviews and friends to tell me of good places to go to.  Unfortunately, Yelp wasn't used in the recommendation for this place, but a friend of mine took me here once and I thought everything was amazing.  I've been coming back ever since.  Last night, my fiancé and I went there for dinner.  For the appetizer, we ordered the Combination Special for two, which has a lot of favorites on it - the satay chicken, thai egg rolls, and my personal favorite, this little meat pie thing, which I don't know the name of.  LOL  My entree was a personal favorite of mine, the spicy noodle, and my fiancé ordered the pad thai, both equally delicious in their own right.    To give a little background of this place, it's own by this cute couple who have owned the restaurant for over thirty years.  The husband does all the cooking, and the wife takes care of the front.  They take time off every now and then, so when that happens, their children help out, and the daughter looks just like her mom.  They're such a sweet family.  Each time we come here, there aren't too many people seated, but they have quite the following.  They get a lot of to-go orders and a lot of regulars.  Each time we've gone there for dinner, they've always been super friendly.  One time, my fiancé ordered something other than Pad Thai, and the lady said, "What? No Pad Thai today?"  It was funny and amazing she remembered because we had not been there in almost a year.  The location is in a weird place, and it's a little hole-in-the-wall, but I often find that the hole-in-the-wall places often serve the best food ever.  The best thing about this Thai restaurant is that they don't rely heavily on dry spices to spice up your dish:  they actually use FRESH Thai peppers to help spice things up, which is something I prefer.  So if you haven't been here yet.....WTF are you waiting for?  Get over there already!!!! Oh and for dessert, you must try the coconut ice cream.  It's not over-powering and not too sweet.  It's just right, with salted peanuts on top.  Yummo.

I've been hearing commercials about Red Robin for years, and I have never gone into one until a month or so ago.  Quite honestly, I expected more.  I think their only saving grace is the tower of onion rings, which were tasty, but they weren't worth the price they charge.  My fiance and I ordered our burgers, which definitely were NOT worth the price they charge for them.  Their burgers are flavor-less, and mine was not medium to medium-well cooked as I had asked (it was more along the lines of medium rare....far too pink for my taste).  I know what you're thinking:  did you send it back?  The answer is no, because I didn't want someone to spit in my food for having to re-make it.  When I got the bill, it was almost $50......for two burgers, a tower of onion rings, and two sodas.  I have to be honest, I can get a better burger at In-N-Out, spend far less money, and be completely satisfied.  Want another example of where you can get better burgers?  SmashBurger, Burger King, and Lenny's.    I definitely will not be coming back to this location, or any of the other ones for that matter.  I even filled out a comment card, someone said they were going to call, but they never did.  I would have given them less than one star, but unfortunately, Yelp doesn't go down that far.  Red Robin, how you are able to stay in business is beyond me.....perhaps it's your booze....who knows.....

Last night was my first time ever having Indian Food. I had always wanted to try it, but I never had the opportunity. Before I begin, let me just say that not all Indian food has curry in it, contrary to popular belief. That's like saying all Japanese eat sushi or RAW sushi, and that's also not entirely true.   Anyway, they start you off with papadum, which is a seasoned crispy tortilla that they serve with chutney. If you've never had chutney, the best way I can describe it is to think of it as a spicy pesto, with a subtle hint of mint. For the appetizer, we had samosas (you can get it with chicken or vegetables, we opted for the vegetables), basically an Indian egg roll. The dipping sauce they serve it with reminded me of funnel cake. So delicious! My entree was the chicken tikka masala. They give you a choice of spice-level of one to fifteen.  I opted for an eight, only because I've never had Indian food before (as I mentioned) and I didn't want it too hot for my first time nor did I want it bland. An eight was just right. And I'm amazed how rich their food is. I will definitely be going back!   Oh, if you're curious, my fiancé had bhindi masala, which was equally good. His dish had some curry in it, mine did not.  :) The people who work there are friendly, but don't expect to hold a conversation with most of them. They know enough English to ask for your order, if they can get you anything else, and that's about it. But they are very nice people. It's nice to go into a restaurant like this one and see other Indians eating AND working there. As I said, I will definitely go back!   I forgot about the dessert!! They give you this dish that has something that looks like a donut hole that's in rice pudding. It wasn't too sweet - it was just right for what was for dinner. If you haven't tried this place yet, you're definitely missing out! And don't be afraid of the spices. If you stick with the middle and work your way up (8 or more), you'll be fine. :)

Today was my second time coming here. I always like to start my reviews after my second visit incase the first wasn't as expected. Anywho, today, since it was so nice outside, my fiancé and I decided to sit out on their beautiful patio. It's the perfect size for large parties and still have room for other patrons to enjoy themselves. My fiancé ordered a beer called Smithwick's, highly recommended for those who love dark beer, but it's not as heavy as something like Guinness.   For the appetizer, we order the Hot Bollix, which is a creation of their own that is a combination of Irish Bacon, potatoes, Irish Cheddar Cheese, and a few other things, fried and served with hot sauce and ranch dressing.  OMG, they are addicting. For the main course, I opted for the Irish Dip and Swiss, which is like a French dip, but served with Swiss cheese instead. Pretty yummers. My fiancé ordered the Reuben, which was big enough to feed two people. Needless to say, we couldn't finish it.   I'm giving it four stars because the service could have been slightly better this time around. The server did not refill my drink (iced tea). Other than that, it was rather enjoyable.

I am giving this restaurant one star tonight for one reason, and one reason only.  I came here tonight to eat, I got seated, looked over the menu, found what I wanted, and waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  About five minutes go by, and one of the busers offered water, chips, and salsa while we waited for our server.  Another five to six minutes go by.  Nothing.  All the other servers looked over and made eye-contact, but not one of them bothered to come to the table.  By this time, about fifteen minutes pass.  I've had enough.  I could understand if someone came to the table and explained that the server was finishing up doing something, in the bathroom, getting fucked by the cook, whatever, but nothing.  I got up to leave and told the manager that I had been sitting at my table with my fiancé for over ten minutes, and the only person who greeted us was a buser.  She apologized, and offered to be our server for the night and comp our meal, but I did not accept the offer.  I have been here several times, and this is the first time I have EVER experienced such horrible service at this restaurant.  Granted, all my previous experiences were good because I was sitting in the bar section....apparently, they have their act together over on the bar side.  Now I know.  I hope the person who was assigned at the table I was at gets fired, or, at least, reprimanded in some way that causes him/her to lose more of his/her tips for the evening.    It'll be awhile before I come back to this location again.  I'm the type of person that will give a restaurant three strikes before I will not go to them again.  Serranos at Rural, this is strike one.  You have two left.

The last time I had AMAZING German food like this place was when I visited family in Jasper IN about 18 years ago.  The soup of the day was a cream of mushroom soup, and OMG, it was SOOOO good!  We had the Sample Sausage appetizer, the Schweizer Schnitzel, and the Kassler Kotelett.  OMG, the food was AMAZING!!!!  This was my husband's first time ever having German food, and he LOVED it.  We're looking forward to going back again real soon!

One of the best Thai places I've been to. Love that they use Thai peppers to spice up your food instead of the dry spices.

I love cheesesteaks. Period. I think the cheesesteak is probably one of the best sub-sandwiches out there, and this place does it correctly.....you can almost see yourself in Philadelphia when you bite into one. Full of flavor and deliciousness in each bite. Locally owned, operated, and everything made to order. If you like extra meat or cheese, you can add it to your sandwich for a few bucks extra. Best of all, the family who runs the place are some of the nicest people you'll come across. :)

This was our first experience at this Vietnamese place.  As I've mentioned in other postings, we are not from this area, so we rely heavily on reviews, word-of-mouth, etc., so I use this app a lot.  The reviews say that the pho is good here, but we didn't get the pho.  We opted for the Bun instead, which is vermicelli noodles.  We both ordered the number 28 and it was amazing....noodles, and grilled chicken with the sauce on the side....yum!  Can't wait to go again!!

I have visited this place many times since my move to Arizona. This is the place to go if you ever are in the mood for a cheesesteak sandwich. You can get it anyway you want it:  chicken or steak, with or without onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and your choice of cheese. If you decide to get fries or even the sweet potato fries, be sure to get their special fry sauce to dip them! It's pretty good!  And what I love about this place is that their cheesesteaks is that there's not a lot of grease as you would imagine there would be - it's quite opposite, so you don't wind up with soggy gross bread!   Anywho....go check them out!

I went to Genghis Grill for the first time the other night.  My finance had told me about it, and I was a little apprehensive on the concept at first.  But I went willingly anyway (mainly because I was hungry, and I was not paying LOL).  When you first get there, you are handed a bowl, you're seated, and then you go to the area where all the food stuff is located.  This is where you can choose from meats galore, vegetables, sauces, and spices, and anything else you want in it.  After you're done choosing, you pick your starch to go in it.  The greatest thing about this place is that you're essentially the cook:  you pick the ingredients, the spices, and the sauces you want in it, so if you don't like it, it's your own fault, NOT the restaurants.  I really like that concept a lot.  So I was a great cook that night.  LOL.  Oh, and another thing:  when you first put your ingredients in the bowl, it's raw.  You give the person behind the counter your bowl full of stuff, and they cook it for you and place your stuff together (with your starch) in a larger bowl for you to pig out on.  I recommend this place to anyone who is a picky eater.  This place would have gotten five stars, but I'm not too keen with the wait staff.  If you can get past Skippy waiting your table, then you'll be fine.  Enjoy.

My fiancé took me here for the first time this afternoon.  Since this place is unfamiliar to me, naturally, I was a little apprehensive about coming, but I have heard nothing but good things about this place, so I wanted to try it anyway.  The decor reminded me of something you would see from a cabin in the woods - it was great, and the bar stools were made out of pieces of wood.  The entire staff was friendly and our server, Shannon, was a complete riot.  Love her.  She gave several recommendations off of the menu, but had a hard time picking just one - my fiance agreed that there is nothing bad at this place.  He ordered the fried chicken, and I had the breakfast chicken fried steak with scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, and added a biscuit, with gravy, of course.  Let me just say that the portions are HUGE, so if you leave hungry, it's your own fault.  My fiance is not fond of buttermilk biscuits (why, I'm not sure), but he loves theirs.  When you go up to pay, they also have the desserts on the display at the counter (yeah, they're evil like that), and even though they looked amazing, I chose not to get any.  Perhaps next time.  We'll definitely be back, that's for sure.

I came here about a year ago with a friend, who introduced this place to me.  It's definitely an interesting concept:  sushi, on a revolving belt, and it's inexpensive?!  I kept thinking that there has to be a catch somehow!!  But, surprisingly, there isn't!  For those who are or curious about it, basically, you write your name on the notepad at the host/hostess stand, and then someone seats you at the bar area.  Caution:  it's kind of small, so you can't take up a lot of room because there will someone you don't know sitting next to you.  No biggie.  The sushi rolls are first-come-first-serve, basically, and each plate has two or four pieces.  And if you get there with a not-so-skinny beautiful brunette woman making the rolls, even better!  I don't know what she does differently, but hers are great!  LOL  Anywho, eat as much as you want!  My fiancé and I go and usually have six or seven plates, each, and the total usually comes out to about $30 - so it's well priced stuff!  Go take a gander!

My fiancé and I come here frequently, and we usually have pretty decent service here. Friday night, however, must have been an off-night for them. We arrived around 5:30, and we only waited ten minutes to get seated, so that part wasn't bad. When we got seated, it took about ten minutes for someone to get our drink order and give us our wasabi dishes. That didn't happen until after we flagged someone down.  It's not like they were under-staffed because they weren't. They had seven servers there, but they seemed completely discombobulated. When we were ready to leave, we waited another fifteen minutes, and the only way we got our check was by me moving out into the isle. The other odd thing - there was a guy who was sitting at the table with a to-go container, taking up a lot of room. If he was getting something to go, he shouldn't have been sitting at the main area. But hey, that's just my thoughts.  It will be awhile before I come back, I think. Quite disappointing.

This was our second time here, and the food (so far) is consistent.  Great appetizers, and food.  However, coming from Houston TX, the portions are smaller than what is served in TX.  LOL

Good news!  They have a bigger parking lot!  Now, you can come and enjoy their home-made ice cream and breathe a little easier, knowing your car won't be dinged by someone going by!  I have been going here for over a year now, and I absolutely love this place.  The ice cream is made right there at the location and they always have different flavors.  If you're not sure what you want, they offer samples.  My personal favorites, to name a few, are the Vietnamese Coffee, Toasted Coconut, Peanut Butter, Banana, and Strawberry.  You can even put your ice cream into a cookie sandwich - how awesome is that?!  The great thing about this place - they are even open LATE so you can get your ice cream fix.  Staff is always friendly and eager to take your order.  :)

I've been here two times so far, and each time the service has been great.  The first time I went here, the person who helped me (I can't remember her name, but it began with an "M") took the time out to explain their menu, what the favorites are, what were new items, etc.  I decided to try their mushroom-swiss burger and their tempura-battered fried green beans with ranch dressing.  I know, I know, it's an odd combination, but trust me, it's pretty damn good.  Pure crack.  And best of all, it gives you that illusion you're eating something healthy-ish.  My only complaint is that I wish that the portion sizes were slightly bigger than what they offer.  But I guess they cater to those who are health freaks, which I'm not one of those people AT ALL!!!  LOL  So yeah - go try it out.  It's pretty good.  :)

Quite possibly the world's best coffee! As a long-time Starbucks fan, I tried this place one day just out of curiosity, and I became instantly hooked!!!  The staff is always friendly and willing to help! My favorites: the annihilated, double chocolate, and the ER-911 (six shots of espresso in it!!) - and you can add other flavors to it. Don't know what you want? Ask a staff member. They have great taste! ;)

The other day, a coworker suggested this place to me, so I thought I would try it.  Wow.  Just.  Wow.  These street tacos are pure crack, I tell you.  One bite is all it takes and you'll be hooked.  I decided to go here yesterday for lunch, and I'm so glad I did.  As others have mentioned, their menu is small, as they only serve chicken and steak street tacos, but hey, that's all you need!  Three bucks per taco, and you get to load it with all the sauces and other toppings they have on hand!  I decided to try both the chicken and steak tacos, all on flour tortillas.  I took one bite, and I instantly fell hard for this place.  It's one of those places that you just take a bite, and you're finding yourself in your happy place.....until you have finished the last taco.  That's when reality settles in and you realize that you don't have another one to eat, so you become saddened and then want to go run back and buy more tacos.....  I'm so glad my coworker suggested this place....I'm definitely coming back.

Let me just start off by saying that I'm not a big seafood eater, but with places like this, it is starting to grow.  I'm always up for trying new things, and a fish taco establishment is definitely new for me.  (I know, I'm deprived.)  I work with the owner's wife, so she suggested that I try it.  I decided to look up the place here, and I think it's a good thing if a place has been open for less than two years, has nearly 190 reviews and a rating of 4.5 stars.  That's quite an achievement because the first few years are the hardest for a business.  So I had to go.  After last night, I'm definitely going back.  Everything is made to order, and it's all homemade (try the ranch dressing with French fries - yum).  If you haven't been there before, the staff will let you know what the favorites are and how everything is prepared.    The menu is small, but I think less is more.  If your menu is too large, then the quality can decrease.  Every bite is packed with delicious flavor.  You get the tacos, and dress them up however you want, so you're responsible if you make it too hot.  :)  Everything is made to order, so if you go during peak times, you can expect to wait a moment or two longer, but they are quick, so you're fine if you only have 30 minutes for lunch....or you could just call ahead so you won't have to inhale your food.  :)  Best of all, this place is doing so well that they are going to open a second location soon in Mesa!  I'm so happy for these guys.  If you're in the mood for something new (if you've never had a fish taco), then definitely try this place.  You'll be glad you did.

Move over, Pita Jungle, hello Gyro Express!!! I've been here twice already, and so far, it's been great! I don't remember what I ordered (I know, that's sad), but I can tell you it was the number nine combo. If you like a lot of meat in your pitas like I do, then this is definitely the place to go! Let me put it to you this way:  I'm a pretty big eater, so I can put away a lot of food, and I have a hard time finishing my sandwich here. Food is great. If you're looking to try Greek/Mediterranean food for the first time, want something fast, or really don't want to venture to Pita Jungle, then come here!

OMG, Cheddars is finally in Arizona!!!! I can't believe it!!!! When I left Texas in 2012, I never thought I'd see one, and I drove by before it opened and couldn't wait to go in! It's just as I remembered it in Texas. The spinach and artichoke dip is my favorite appetizer. If you're into salads, theirs are really good - especially since they are served with a croissant that's been topped with melted honey butter. Yum. Their chicken strips are good; my favorite dishes are the New Orleans pasta and the lemon pepper chicken. I've also had (at another location) their chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken.  Yum. My only advice:  if you leave hungry, it's your own fault because they don't skimp on the portion sizes. I read a review that said if you're thinking expensive, don't. One person can eat for under $10, easily. Try it all. I haven't had anything bad there. All the locations are pretty similar as far as quality and taste.  Enjoy!!

As of today, I am no longer a barbershop virgin!  I just moved about 20 minutes east of where I was living, and I haven't been completely satisfied with the place I had been going to for a few years (hair salon, not barbershop). I figured these were the perfect excuses for trying something new - and not a salon. Barbershops are gaining popularity again, and I had been wanting to try one for awhile. I walked in, signed in, and I waited an all of three minutes to get my haircut. I haven't had to explain how to cut my hair in quite awhile, so I wasn't sure how to explain it, and I also didn't really know what I wanted to do. Lawrence was patient, and he threw in some suggestions. We went with one, and he did a fantastic job. I'm telling everyone I know to go see Lawrence. I'll definitely be back again.
