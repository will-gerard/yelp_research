We have been using this location for the past couple of years. Until the past 2 weeks there were no problems. However, it seems they have hired lots of new staff and I don't think I will be back.  We use dry cleaning services on a weekly basis.  Last week we dropped off 7 shirts and 2 pants. We went back the next day and they gave us 4 shirts and 4 pants. Luckily I looked through them before we left because they had fully intended to give us some other mans pants. In addition they had lost three shirts. They told us they must have misplaced them and to come back the next day. The girl clearly wasn't sure what was going on and did not seem to really care.  The next day when we went back they gave us two of the three shirts. They said the last one was still in process but assured us it wasn't "lost". At this point my boyfriend paid for the two shirts (even though one was still missing and they had already made us come back once). I went about 3 days later to see if they found the missing shirt. Well they did after about 10 minutes of searching. Apparently it was placed in the wrong alphabetical area. The employee then asked for me to pay for it. I told her I didn't think I should be charged considering it was the third time I'd come to get the shirt and it was lost for over a week. She had to go in the back to talk to her manager and then finally gave me the shirt free of charge.  After having multiple missing items and being give someone else's laundry I am very hesitant to use this location in the future!

We have been to Cowboy Ciao several times before and the food is always excellent.  The food deserves 5 stars but because of the bad experience we had last night I can't give the restaurant 5 stars!  My boyfriend had some co-workers in town so the four of us went for dinner on Friday night.  From the very beginning we experienced lackluster service.  We tried to order Nickolasha shots (which I highly recommend!) while we waited for our counterparts to arrive but we couldn't seem to catch the waiters attention.  We waited so long, we considered going to the bar to order them instead.  Actually the only time the waiter was prompt was when the check arrived, he hurriedly brought it to the table while we still had full glasses of wine and wine in the bottle making no mention of "taking our time" with the bill.  He then refused to split the bills between us saying this was something that "can't be done", but rather he could only split the amount between two cards which I found strange. (And in the end after we asked again he ended up splitting it so clearly it COULD be done in the first place if he was so inclined).  Truly though these were all minor infractions that I probably would not have noticed or cared about if an entire glass of ice water had not been spilled on my boyfriend and I.  Prior to our dinner arriving another waitress was refilling our glasses and dumped a glass of ice water in our laps.  I don't blame her, it was an honest mistake and she was truly mortified.  HOWEVER, nothing was offered to us period.  Not a free drink, discount, etc. I have never experienced something like this, especially at such a high end restaurant.  Our waiter didn't even offer his apologies.  For that reason alone I will be hesitant to visit in the future.   But as I mentioned before the food is a 5/5.  FOOD:  Stetson Salad- a MUST order, our friends could not stop raving about it.  Mini Mushroom Pan Fry- Good vegetarian dish, the half is a full serving!  Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes- Very flavorful, I normally don't eat a lot of meat but I couldn't stop stealing bites off of my boyfriends plate!!

We went to spinners for bike rental. The bikes were a great price and the manager (I think, there was only one employee) was super friendly.  It's right on the green belt so it makes it an easy ride. We bought the Yelp deal and rented two bikes for 2 hours. The toal price was 22$. They also give you a lock incase you want to stop. We rode down the greenbelt to Tempe and then along Tempe Town Lake (5miles there from the shop).  They also have a huge selection of disc golf discs that are very inexpensive.  Great experience I can't wait to rent a bike from them again!

I really have nothing negative to say about POMO pizza! This is the prefect restaurant if your in the mood for pizza.  Its good for casual lunches with out of town guests or romantic date nights.  We have been here several times and have never once had a negative experience.  The only problem is you need to go with a friend who enjoys your taste in pizza so you can split a pizza and salad! (Which is not a bad problem to have!)  Our favorite pizza is the pineapple prosciutto but its only a special and they don't always have it.   I would recommend the PRINCIPE pizza and Romona salad.  As far as pizza goes this is one of the best! (However, as a small side note to out of town guests, if you only have time for one night of pizza in the Phoenix area I would recommend Bianco, Sorry Pomo I still love you! )

Sip is one of those so good places that you almost don't want to review because its already hard enough to find a parking spot in the tiny lot!  (By the way thats the only negative).  I haven't had the food but the coffee is beyond wonderful.  My favorite is the cold brew iced coffee with carmel and almond milk. The atmosphere is wonderful, cool art and laid back vibes.   They have plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor.  The staff is also very friendly and fun.  If you have any questions just ask them!!  One thing I must say is they seem to be hiring new staff and  some employees (baristas?) really rise above the rest.
