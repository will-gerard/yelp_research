Alice Cooper'stown is directly across the street from the US Airways Center (home to the Phoenix Suns.)  When I first visited the restaurant, the Suns were putting their finishing moves on the Utah Jazz (84-87), and I suppose it was due to the game that business that evening was slow.  However, for me, it didn't matter.  Besides paying respect to Mr. Cooper, an episode of "Man vs Food" wherein Adam Richman and Alice--the shock-rocking legend himself--attack 22"-long "Big Unit" hotdogs was motivation enough: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C86akA3G6rg.  The "Big Unit"--smothered in "Nightmare" Chili, bacon, cheese sauce, sauerkraut, jalapeños, diced tomatoes and onions, sweet relish, and shredded cheddar--is jaw-dropping!  In fact, upon delievery, fire alarms--shrilling throughout the restaurant--direct full attention to this behemoth as it snakes its way toward its next victim: me.  Respectfully named after the now-retired, 6'10" Arizona Diamondback, Randy "The Big Unit" Johnson, this dog headlines.  At $19.99, it seems a bit steep, but I couldn't eat more than a third.  Along with the fries, it easily feeds two or three.  Divided, the cost is more than reasonable.  The "Elaine Benes" Big Salad, the "Johnny 'Beef' Depp", the "Al McCoy" ["The Voice of the Suns" since 1972] Crispy Chicken Salad, the "John O'Hurley" ["Seinfeld's" J. Peterman] Buffalo Chicken Wrap: the menu items definitely hail celebrity.  But why not?  The fare--along this guitar-lined, autograph-infused, rock-n-roll museum--is meant to be fun.  And it is.  Even though, on this evening, the locals were instead supporting their beloved Suns, I had a great time with my friends.  Cooper'stown is worth a try.  I will say that it's an interesting touch that the servers and bartenders should adopt the Cooper-esque eye make-up--it's cool--but our server wasn't enthused: his bother-me-not attitude and poor service had me questioning his allegiance.  I mean, you work at Cooper'stown!  I know that between two servers and four tables, feeling as though you're in the weeds at times is natural, but couldn't you at least "feign" appreciation and interest?  The manager, however, checked-in on us, refilled our drinks, and asked about our visit.  I think he's quite aware.   Note to Mr. Cooper:    When I was a kid, Alice Cooper album covers completely unnerved--yet intrigued--me.  I was ten, and I remember visiting our neighbors--hard rockers to the core--who had many of your LP's resting against their metal-plated, knob-heavy component stereo system in their living room.  I would walk around their house pretending I was cool and ignoring--or at least attempting to ignore--your nightmare: I couldn't look you in the eye.  At Cooper'stown, however, upon the slightest chance that you might drop in, I'd kept an eye out...just in case!  I'm not afraid anymore...I don't think.   =]   Nevertheless, for your music, your vision, and your endeavors, I'm a fan.  And I thank you.

The year: 2010.    The episode: "Phoenix."  The Man: Adam Richman, himself.  The Challenge: Chompie's "The Ultimate Slider Challenge."  ...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.  ...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's "Hall of Fame" website (http://chompies.com/wall-of-fame/) and an "Ultimate Slider Challenge" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?  This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were "deli-icious."  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?  So, "Man vs Food"...  That takes care of Phoenix: Alice Cooper'stown (http://www.yelp.com/biz/alice-cooperstown-phoenix?hrid=esDZwjuGZQlkpKrZAC_guQ), Los Reyes de la Torta (http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-reyes-de-la-torta-phoenix-2?hrid=nJiqRCfTtxs2bIoFrPdmkA), and now Chompie's.  On deck, LA.  =]

As with everything, I imagine, different music stores have their own culture: it's like (if at all you remember) the opposing cultures of Werehouse Records and Tower Records.  Werehouse was a bit more corporate and homogenized, while Tower was much more relaxed and hip.  To me, Zia Records feels more like the Towers of lore, with a bit more structure and a lot more personality.  You walk in, and you could spend an easy hour just sifting around looking for bargains.  Unlike Tower, the Zia staff isn't condescending just because they have tattoos and plugs, and you don't.  Zia has respect AND nice bargains.  I bought a CD at FYE in Fullerton, CA, drove to Arizona, and found it for half the price at Zia.  That's a long drive for a used CD, I know.  But I bought multiple!  If you're opposed to Amazon, if you're tired of FYE (who isn't?), then you can also shop Zia online.

Prepare for a shift in perspective...  Too many times, Mexican food is rather typical.  In fact it's likely that, with few variances and exceptions, predictions prevail.  Not that Mexican food isn't super tasty, because it is.  It's just that it isn't usually served with much explosive flair or out-of-the-box creativity.  (I mean, we've all come to know what to expect.)  That is until you've visited the Barrio Café.  When here, forget what you've known, what you've grown up with.  At the Barrio, Chef Silvana's sophistication and assertiveness with the culinary traditions of Mexican cuisine challenges any and all notions of south-of-the-border authenticity.  Imagine: apples, pears, dried apricots and pecans nesting harmoniously amidst savory chicken, enveloped in a roasted poblano pepper and finished with a light almond sauce, the colors of the Mexican flag (cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds) artfully decorating the myriad of flavors...  "Chiles en Nogada," as explored by Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives," is the signature dish that brought me to the artistry of the Barrio.  And it is also the "Chiles en Nogada" that has forever now changed what I thought Mexican cuisine could actually be.  Chef Silvana certainly has an eye for presentation.  To visit Barrio Café is to appreciate that vision.

Had it not been for the Illuminations Half Marathon http://www.yelp.com/biz/illuminations-half-arizona-phoenix, I would have never known...never known that set amidst the majestic Sonoran Desert and surrounded by the beautiful McDowell Mountains--rows upon prickly rows of saguaro cacti maintaining their century-old vigils--sits JW Marriott's spectacular Desert Ridge Resort.  People golf here, it seems.  I mean, the Marriott shoulders two championship golf courses, ones designed in part by Arnold Palmer, and they look seriously cool...if you're a golfer.  I'm not.  In fact, I hate golfing.  Rather, I came here to run.  And these courses, illuminated for the Half Marathon with hundreds and hundreds of glowsticks, were great fun nonetheless--beautiful, even after sundown.  The amenities at the Marriott--lazy river, heated pools, spa, fitness center, tennis courts (to name a few)--were impressive.  And although I hadn't the time to explore them--my stay was short--I took notice, traveling about the resort, snapping a few shots.  Next time--and I'm sure there'll be a next time--I'll give them a try.  What was nice, though, was simply waking early, grabbing a Peppermint Mocha from the in-house Starbucks, and sitting outside, fire pit cozy.  I love mornings!  And in Phoenix, it seems, some golfers enjoy mornings too.

Gratuity is ALWAYS added, so be careful!  That "tip" is what is most important here.  I mean, it's a sushi restaurant in Arizona.  That's about a 6-hour, over-the-speed-limit drive to the nearest ocean.  Oh yeah...one more thing: the all-you-can-eat-sushi limited menu is rice HEAVY.  I wonder why.  :P

Late November... The desert air, crisp and clean on a Sunday morning, And I'm surrounded. Surrounded by multiple games upon multiple screens, Lions and Pats, Cards and Hawks. Friends of old sitting across from one another, stories--once told, Now again and again--flung casually about, bouncing Here and there and here and there... The fireplace aglow, and another on-tap round, Orange-slice garnishings. Cheers were in order, and the Verrado Grille, Also relaxing in the mid-morning sun and welcoming any and all Who have the luxury of lazy, weekend afternoons, Hosted.  Here, you recline.  And at noontime sharp, Our Happy Hour, Suggestions, recommendations, libations... Fives and sixes, listed mixes, And fondues and sliders And caesars and ritas. Truffles and pretzels, wings, quesadillas... Verrado Grille makes your stay easy. The game's not over, however. So stay awhile. Enjoy The moment and the Smiles Surrounding You.

Again, upon Adam Richman's heels...    As a continued fan of "Man vs Food" and after having bookmarked a few of Adam's noted, Phoenician eateries--Chompie's, Alice Cooper'stown, and Los Reyes de la Torta--I saddled up, traversed over 350 sun-scorched miles, and with extreme prejudice negotiated terms of surrender with a literal powerhouse of a Mexican sandwich--one piled high, layered thick, and respectfully ordained "Del Rey."  ¡Muy delicioso!  Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dogs, omelet, chorizo, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce: all hail the King!  Ok, it's true, I may be a bit biased--after all, who am I to contradict Adam?--but unwavering confidence and grandeur shoulder this reigning torta.  My job, put simply: tossing confetti.  How am I doing?  =]  The rundown:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KjOMCauQYI.  (By the way, I visited the West Indian School Rd. location, while Adam opted northward to Sunnyslope's haunt on North 7th St.)  What was even better was being treated like kings, ourselves, while we were there.  We really were.  The service was supreme!  My only regret was not taking a picture of the Elvis statue in the window!  Yes, the King himself.  But I'll get it next time.  Trust me.  Adam...lead on!
