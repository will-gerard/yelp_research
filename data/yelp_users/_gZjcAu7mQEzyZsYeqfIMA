I absolutely love this place when dining there. But, we don't get to do that very often. We have 4 kiddos, so we tend to order and pick up more often for a better dining experience. Lol   The last 4 times we have ordered by phone for pick up, there has ALWAYS been a problem with the order. Anywhere from missing 2 entire meals, to missing sides of beans or rice, to no chips and salsa and even wrong dinner order orders. I am so frustrated with them. Every time we call, they just say oops, we'll replace it next time. I've officially given up with Ajo Al's. Sad to say it, but they can only screw up so many times before losing my business. And unfortunately, they don't do enough to make up for their mistakes.

Love this place since they opened, but I will say they are giving smaller portions of food than they used to. Also, the salsa fresca isn't so fresca (fresh) as it used to be. But one of the best chicken chimichangas out there!

Have been going here for over 7 years now. Dr. Prentice is just awesome. She's great with all 4 of my kids. And even though we don't come in all that often, she always remembers my kids names and everything about them. It's a very clean and organized office too.

Jack Daniel Pecan Pie. Nothing else matters here. Pure heaven. They aren't kidding when they say they have world famous pies. They don't skimp on ingredients or size. We've also had the cherry, apple crumb & boys empire. They're all so good. I always pick one up for my husband who's obsessed with their pies. You really can't go wrong with any of them. We've yet to actually eat at the cafe however.

Although it's not the greatest service, they always take good care of my two younger boys and do as I ask. I have never had a problem.  Some of them do you have accents that are hard to understand, but at least they're always smiling. And I love the online check-in feature. Saves so much time.

We had a prom dress disaster 2 days before prom with a black stain on an ivory dress. They were so awesome here! Cleaned it perfectly, ready by the next day & only charged us $5! I highly recommend this place!

The. Best. Steakhouse. In town. Hands down. I've been to both the desert ridge location and Tempe location and both were outstanding. In service and food! I'm extremely picky about steaks and how they're cooked. Medium Rare seems to mean something very different between restaurants, but The Keg gets it perfect every time. It beats Ruth Christs, Firebirds, Texas Roadhouse, Houstons, Fleming's. Durant's is the only one in close comparison. They also brought out champagne when they heard it was our anniversary. So sweet.

Hands down, one of the best places for Italian Beef. I love Luke's and they have always been my favorite place for Italian Beef. They have competition with Dazzo's! Awesome fries too!

Food was pretty good , service from waitress was decent. I had a groupon and the mgr wouldn't honor it though, which ticked me off.

Amazing ambiance and excellent food! A great place to go for a date. My husband and I went for our anniversary and we were very happy with the food. Gorgonzola arugula salad, and the special linguini with scallops, shrimp and salmon in light red sauce. Very good! Service was a little slow, but other than that, we were very satisfied with our experience here.

I used to like this place. It's gone downhill. Service and food used to be pretty good, now both have gone out the window. I must have heard "I'm sorry w'ere out of that "5 times in one visit. I even heard the manager yelling at the staff. Just not a good place to go anymore.

I've been coming here for years. Amy the owner is very nice and gives 5% off for cash transactions. Helen is my absolute favorite. She is so nice and does such a great job. They do all kinds of fabulous designs, but you will pay more for that. Awesome manicures too. The gel French is wonderful and stays on for 2-3 weeks without chipping.

Came on a Thursday at 10am for a late breakfast with my husband and 3 kids. It wasn't very busy at all, but took an hour to get our food. Our kids were restless and antsy and it made for a frustrating wait. It was our first visit, we've been wanting to try for some time. I got the steak and eggs. The steak was cooked as desired and had decent flavor. The country potatoes were terrible, however, hardly cooked, almost raw mixed with hardly any peppers and onions. They offered it with fruit or biscuits, but had to pay an addt'l $1.75 for gravy. LAME! Who orders biscuits without gravy? At any rate, the small and meager amount of gravy I did receive was decent, nothing great. All in all, our bill was over $50, for a blah breakfast. We probably won't return due to service and just nothing to write home about food.

I'm not sure where to begin on this one. My husband and I had a date night which doesn't happen very often with one year old twins and a 3 yr old at home. We decided to try out AG for the 1st time since we wanted a good steak. Waited 4-5 minutes to be seated and ordered a couple of Blue moon beers on draft. When I was halfway done with my beer, I took a drink and I swallowed something very sharp and hurt going down. I took another drink and realized it was inside my beer. I looked in the glass and realized it was filled with tons on shaved and cracked glass. Probably from stacking the glasses. Large and small chunks and shavings, who knows how much I actually swallowed. When I told my waitress, she looked shocked and then seemed to act as if I made it up. The chef then came over to my husband and I and apologized and offered a free dessert. Now, I just ordered $130 worth of food and alcohol and you want to give me a free dessert? Are you kidding me? I swallowed glass! The manager never even came over.. The food was good, although I do not think worth the price. I still can't get over this situation and will never go back. I am appalled at how we were treated and they should have at least paid for my meal considering the circumstances!

AMAZING steaks. Aged and cooked perfectly. It's not too often we can splurge on meals like this, but we were so glad we did. Our anniversary is coming up in April and we will be going to Fleming's for sure. My husband loves their bleu cheese steak and the filet is fantastic. It's so hard to decide on side dishes, but you can't go wrong with any of them.   I was also very impressed with their service and the ambiance is perfect for a romantic meal.

So we have 3 younger kids. They gave each of our kids a tablet to play with before dinner with Disney and Dr. Seuss apps. I was shocked. I had the prime rib and it was outstanding. We love going here based on prices for our family of 6. Great desserts too.

Pretty decent sports bar. Several tv's to watch football, typical bar food. We watched a playoff game and ordered wings & nachos. Loved the wings. We did have to move tables because the horse betters kept getting in out way, but other than that, really liked the place. Our server April was very nice and friendly and constantly asked how we were. Hard to find a good sports bar, so I would recommend it.

I just had a two hour massage with Eric. When I asked for deep tissue, he didn't mess around. He was extremely nice and always made sure I was comfortable. The ambiance was decent, nothing like the resorts, but you can't beat the price of $95 for two hours. I will definitely go back and am considering the membership option too.

We called on a Friday night at 6:15 to just leave a message for Monday. To our surprise, they answered and said they would send someone out in the morning for no charge. We were shocked. Chris arrived promptly as promised and realized it was just our thermostat we installed over summer. We didn't realize we had to set the heat settings differently for gas vs our electric air. He had it fixed within minutes and didn't charge us a penny. Yelp users get that wonderful benefit. Be sure to mention you saw them on Yelp. Now, I feel I'm a good judge of character. Chris was genuinely caring and honest. Our unit is almost 18 years old, so it's getting to be that time to do. Guess who we will be calling? Yep. Bell Air. Thanks!

I had the mushroom & Swiss burger which was delicious. I wasn't crazy about the sea salt fries tho. My hubby loved his Arizona burger and rosemary, garlic and olive oil fries. Overall, not bad at all!

Seriously, hands down the BEST breakfast burritos and green sauce around. I consider myself a burrito and green sauce connoisseur and have had many all over the valley. Ramiros is priced well and delicious. They even make delicious chimichangas.

The Duce hosted the @instagramaz World Wide Instameet. It was my first time here, it was such an aesthetically beautiful place. Very unique. Great service and inside and outside seating. Some shopping too. Loved everything about this bar/lounge. They serve food too,  but didn't order anything. Definitely a must place to go if you go downtown. @theduce #theduce #yelp

Went in on a Friday early afternoon for lunch. They had a lunch special with a 12" pizza along with soup or salad for $10.95. It's a great deal and actually I had leftover pizza. The chopped salad was delicious with salami & turkey and an herb vinaigrette. We also ordered the tomato bruschetta. The bread was amazing. The buffalo mozzarella was good, but a little bland and creamed. Balsamic vinegar and tomatoes were perfect with a little basil too.  I ordered the meat lovers pizza and it was very good. The sauce and crust were cooked perfectly. The service was awesome, very attentive. Definitely will go back!

Stopped in for lunch after gymnastics with my 3 kids and husband. Service was great, our waitress was very attentive. We ordered the cowboy wings for an appetizer and they were fantastic. I ordered the cowboy tacos. They're made with prime rib, spicy cabbage, pico de gallo and black beans. Three small street taco size. They were very good. My husband ordered the sloppy joe and fries and he enjoyed it as well calling it a sweet sloppy joe. Kids meals were priced well and good serving size for any age. I would definitely come back. I want to try the chicken pot pie next.

Jimmy John's is always fresh and done perfectly. Always such a fun and friendly environment and hard working people smiling. I wills say my favorite part of this place is the fresh bread they sell from the day before for $0.45. I Love buying a ton and using for Sunday's when we make pasta. They make for delicious garlic bread.

This place is all heart. It's more than a typical CrossFit, it's family too. The coaches are patient, caring, kind, but also push you to be the best athlete you can be. I'm so glad I made this positive change in my life and meet the Jefe family.

Between their pizzas and desserts, wow! Service was just ok. She wasn't very knowledgeable of the menu. We started with the bruschetta. Disappointed in serving size, as there was only two slices of bread served. But, the taste and flavor was spot on. We had three different pizzas, and they were outstanding. Flavor was perfect and had such fresh ingredients. The crust was absolutely delectable too. It honestly tasted like it was straight from the streets of Italy. Our dessert was even better. Chocolate mousse covering decadent cream puffs. Can't wait to go back and try something else.
