I'm not sure about the other reviews, but our experience was great.  The service was prompt and polite.  And the food was excellent.  I've had better sushi, but it wasn't bad at all.  The teppanyaki chef was incredibly entertaining and delicious.  Certainly more expensive than your average chain restaurant, but it was worth it!

Very disappointed!  Last 2 times I've been I was very unhappy. A while ago, we did the drive through and the  fried chicken was falling apart and bones inside were broken.  Almost like it was smacked around on the counter.  This last time, we had the grilled, and most of it was very dry and

Came here for a Father's Day lunch. Chicken Satay appetizer was fantastic.  Had the green curry chicken Kaeng Peg,mild. Was still pretty hot,  though not unbearable.  Very yummy and very creamy. Wife had the Drunken Noodles with chicken. She really liked it for her first Thai. Great service too!

Pretty good little dive bar.  Great chips and guacamole and tasty potato skins.  And they even have Stone IPA on tap!
