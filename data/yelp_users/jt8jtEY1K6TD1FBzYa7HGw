If you're in search for fresh delicious sushi in Phoenix, you should definitely try this spot.  I'm not into rolls so much, so if you want trendy overpriced gringo sushi then you might want to head over to Pure Sushi in Scottsdale.  I've eaten here several times, and I've never been disappointed.  The price point is fair and the sashimi and nigiri are fresh and always satisfying!    We always sit at the bar, and you can hear the sounds of people "mmmm'ing" all around, and gratuitously thanking the chef for their meal.    The ambiance won't win any awards, but it's clean and the the staff is undyingly polite and attentive.   Last time I was in the chef urged us to try the white tuna that he had just had Fed ex'd from Hawaii... OMFG, it was such a fantastic flavor experience.  With that I urge you the brave at heart to try whatever is on the specials menu.

Delhi Palace saved my dinner party! I was getting over a nasty 24-hour bug, and was panicked about how on earth I was going to be able to pull off a vegetarian duel birthday dinner party for my Scorpio-signed, non-meat eating folks.   My boyfriend suggested ordering a bunch of food for everyone. I was non-too-thrilled by this suggestion, but felt I had nothing better to offer. Cooking, cleaning and preparing for the party would have surely put me over the edge, so I went along with it.  The responsibility of ordering for everyone sort of put me in a state of quiet anxiety, but I knew I needed to bite the bullet.  Ordering for 13 people I got the following:  APPS 3 Vegetable Pakora (6/order) apps - too salty, over done, wouldn't order again 5 Samosa (2 large per order) apps - we split them in 2 so there would be 20. They were gone in minutes.  So delicious, and really reasonable at $2.49/order DINNER 1 Vegetable Korma - excellent, should have ordered 2 of them 2 Daal Maharani - excellent, and there was nothing left 2 Bengan Bharta - too salty, wouldn't order this again, hardly touched 2 Palak Paneer - excellent, a true hit 1 Malai Kofta - delicate and delicious   Oh, how could I forget, we ordered lots of Garlic Naan, and a platter of Basmati rice.  The apps came with mint chutney and tamarind chutney, and I ordered raita (cool whipped yogurt) to drizzle over the spicy preps.  Dinner was around $170. It was entirely worth it.  No stress, no mess, and everyone was thanking us for the Indian treats. Plus, we had Indian food for dinner the next night!  What I gleaned from this experience was I could have definitely ordered less food.  There was tons of left overs.  I would say that one dinner dish safely satisfies 2 guests.  Favorites were: Palak Paneer, Vegetable Korma, Daal Maharani, Garlic Naan, Samosas.  One last thing, this place has the best Indian Buffet in town... if you're into that sort of thing (wink).

So, I've been going to this place for years, not b/c the food blows my mind, but rather it hits the spot. Plus, I love sitting on the patio drinking wine when the weather is nice with my best gal.   Anyhow, my other best gal, my mom had never tried this spot. I  thought Duck would be great for a quick casual lunch. She's a vegetarian so we ordered the Where's the Beef sandwich to share. It took about 20 minutes to make the sandwich, which feels like an eternity when your hungry.  When I glanced at the sandwich I thought perhaps they had added some portobello mushrooms to it. Turns out, the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado. REALLY!!!!??? I mean come on! Avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians. How can you F this up? It was truly nasty. It got me to thinking, if someone actually put this into the sandwich, what else would their low standards allow them to place into an unsuspecting victims sammie. It's not like they make them with blindfolds on. I was really grossed out.  When I brought it to the manager's attention, she didn't seem that bothered by it. They remade half a sandwich for me, and that was that.  It was annoying b/c I left feeling that Duck & Decanter takes for granted the fact that loyal customers will stick with them no matter what. Well, not this one.  Plus, that place needs a serious dusting. Yuck.

My favorite thing to do is grab a bunch of sliders that fit perfectly into my over-sized purse to sneak 'em into the movies.  You might not make any friends if you do this b/c somehow in a dark theatre all you can smell is the onions, which I never notice when I eat them there or at home. Ha!  Oh well, it's a fun little treat.  Super yummy comfort food!

This is not a gourmet spot, so don't expect roasted butternut squash from the local farmers market atop your pizza with a side salad of seasonal greens.  If you live in the neighborhood, then you're lucky to have a place like Pats' down the road.  The cheese & pepperoni pizzas are solidly delicious and sinfully unhealthy as most pizzas should be.   Their pasta dishes are a fantastic value, all coming in under $10. Each pasta meal includes a side salad (iceberg, onion, tomato), garlic bread and a pasta portion big enough for two. The manicotti, baked rigatoni and Chicken Cutlet with spaghetti are all yummy, and like I said, enough for 2 people.  Try a side of their homemade meatballs for around $3, you won't be let down.  This is not a place where you want to eat at, as it's just a paper napkin plastic utensil, order-at-the-counter type of joint.  I recommend calling your order in, and eating it in the comfort of your own home.  Yummy on!

Quality control seems to have disappeared here.  The crust is a disaster these days... and they're really slow... 45 minutes is too long to wait for a casual, mom & pop pizza joint.

Pretty yummy coffee, with a very personal touch on the cup, as they put an adorable little sticker with your name and drink on each cup.      Fantastic ambiance and decor with Angela Adams carpets, Jonathan Adler ceramic pieces, fresh flowers and affordable local art that is constantly in flux.      Just don't walk in while they're roasting, you'll have to go home immediately and change.  Your clothes will smell like burnt chocolate, or, um roasted coffee beans.  Not my favorite aroma.    The sweets, made with love by the proprietor of 'Tart' are excellent as well!

I find they're gringo, faux -Mexican food, heartburn inducing and unimaginative.   Why would anyone eat there when they're are far better and more authentic choices for Mexican food in the Phoenix area?    Try Los Sombreros as an outstanding alternative to a huge disapointment.

I have to give this place at least 4 stars.  Yummiest Pommegranite Margs.  To die for I swear, and with the Happy Hour 2-for-1 special, they're really irresistable.  The ambiance is refreshing after a long day of  being in the nasty heat.  The service is like a sweet dream, and the crowd never fails to charm.

This place has definitely improved. I remember the early days of soggy crusts, cheap cheese, subpar ingredients and heartburn.  This is certainly no longer the case.  The place was super jammed around 6pm on a Thursday night.  It was actually kind of exciting!  All the guys in back were having a good ol' time, and the gals up front taking the orders were visibly stressed, but doing a great job.    We ended up creating our own vegetarian pizza.  We kept it simple, and just added mushrooms & onions.  It's everyone's new favorite... in fact, I've been ordering the same combination at other pizza places, but it's not nearly as yummy as Mamma Mia's version.    They have a great selection to build your own, however I'm sure that all their offerings are a hit as evidenced by the long line of hungry pizza lovers going out the door.

I'm sure I'll be reported to the Yelp police for saying this, but the macaroons don't do it for me here. They are playfully beautiful, but far too sweet for my tastes.  The croissants are really where this place shines.   In my opinion the croissants are unmatched! Well, Scratch's chocolate croissant is definitely a contender. They provide Cartel's croissants, which has some of the very best coffee in town!  Their variety box of mini-treats are a great value, and make for a wonderful gift for a client or friend.

Walking up the gently lit side corridor was an inviting prelude to the entry with a side peak of the open air indoor/oudoor bar that has a gorgeous illuminated onyx bar top.  The layout is quite nice, and  certainly is a place Phoenicians can be proud of.   Beautiful surface materials abound, which are a perfect example of how restraining architectural details allow the visitor to really appreciate the space and the dining experience.  I respect that Aaron Chamberlin candidly admits that the menu is still growing,  wine list being tweaked, and more dessert items shall be added.  I adore restaurants that have an evolving menu that incorporate seasonal ingredients and the chef's favorite food ensembles of the moment.  We shared a refreshing salad with chilled corn, radish, mini heirlooms with a  decadent homemade butter cream ranch dressing.  Plenty for 2, and very reasonably priced at $8.  Oh yeah, and there is a bread service!  The corn chowder was not to our tastes, but the Halibut with eggplant and green and yellow string beans was divine, and perfectly prepared.  I can't provide a technical description of the dessert, expect for it was like a toffee bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla gelato on top.  YUM!  They serve Cartel Coffee (Tempe), which is quite delicious, is and another locally owned spot, that I encourage everyone to try.  The service was absolutely stellar!  Our waiter was well-informed, attentive, and really let us take our time and enjoy ourselves.   St. Francis is a welcome, and much needed newcomer to the ever expanding Central Phoenix dining experience.

J'adore Bertha's!   I always cater my lunches from this place, and my clients love me for it.  I've had post presentation sessions where in which we did a blind taste test of Bertha's red velvet cupcakes compared against Sprinkle's red velvets, and Bertha's always is the victor.    The sweets are just the right amount of sweet, not the cavity inducing sweet like Tammie Coe's stuff. Try the banana bread pudding heated up with their side of caramel sauce, and you won't be sorry!  The chicken havarti panini with arugula is divine, and enough for two!  On the breakky side of life, the homemade granola with freshly cut fruit is off the hook, and less than 5 bucks.  The breakfast sandwiches are all really affordable as well.  My personal fav is the egg sandwich with applewood smoked bacon and arugula served on a fresh ciabatta roll.   The coffee ain't too shabby either.  ENJOY.

I'll be quite honest, I choose Hanny's time & time again b/c it's one of the most low-key, yet sophisticated places to get together with a large group of friends. Great music, superior comfort, & wonderful cocktails.  The interior architecture makes me swoon... the triple laminated glass floor in the elevator shaft is particularly exciting after a few Moscow Mules. I love how the unisex restrooms are tucked away, and create an Alice & Wonderland effect of, "which door should I go through" contemplation. The long lazy chaise lounges remind me of a giant cow's tongue. They are an amazing place to spread out after dinner & continue the conversation.  In fact, you can even eat there if you'd like.  That brings me to the food. The food is good & reasonably priced. The portions generous & easy to share.  However, they will never win any awards, or get anyone excited by their offerings. If you're looking for something to awaken your taste-buds, then you might want to reserve this place for an evening where food isn't the main ingredient.

All I've got to say, is that this place continues to rock my world! Birthday, after birthday, and maybe even on unbirthdays, this place never lets me down.   There might come a time when I grow tired of the double chocolate bundt cake, but I don't want to think about that day.  Instead, I think I'll go finish the rest of the cake left over from the other night's party.  Mmmmmmm

Naco Torta +  Kale Salad = Satisfaction Guaranteed. This is more than enough for 2 people.  This place is one of the best values in central Phoenix.   Service can be a bit slow, and lack luster, but the food gets a solid 5 stars  Gallo also comes to the rescue on Wednesday nights with free Flamenco entertainment. It's pretty special...

To those as sick of going to LGO Pizzaria as me:   It was so wonderful to walk into one of our small architectural treasures that hasn't been torn down, but actually adaptively re-used and re-imagined into a gorgeous, warm yet contemporary eatery.  I can't stop talking about the ingenious curtain wall of glass that allows the filtered light from the geometric concrete shade wall to gently glow into the interior.  On my first visit, I wasn't feeling very adventurous , so I ordered the pepperoni and mushroom pizza with torn basil, and as pedestrian as that sounds, it  was simply the stand-out of the evening.  I loved all of the salads, but thought the Cesar Salad too salty for my tastes.  The creamy fettucini pasta I tried was scrumptious!  I tried another creamy pasta dish, but it had some raddichio in it that overwhelmed the delicate creamy identity. The anitpasto (going backwards here) was super satisfying and diverse.  I appreciated the dipping sauces, and the hard to pronouncecured meats and delicious cheeses that our waitress was sweet enough to repeatedly pronounce for all of us approaching our 3rd or 4th glass of wine.     I love that the coffee came in our very own little red French Presses, and that our waitress, when hearing the despicably dirty jokes being tossed around the table, chimed in with a few from her own repertoire.  The 2nd time was at the bar, and the bartender didn't cut the muster for me.  He was slow, and we had to ask him repeatedly for simple things like silverware and water.  The food was just as excellent... my new favorite pizza spot for sure!

I love this no nonsense joint for so many reasons. It's delicious, fast and super affordable. I don't know what I would do without my weekly pho and crispy spring roll fix. Best crispy spring rolls I've had in the Phx area. While I don't often stray from my weekly fix, the egg noodle soups and buns bowls with bbq pork are also fantastic menu items, as are the fresh pork and shrimp spring rolls if you aren't into fried apps.   It's also a wonderful take-out option, as they include everything expertly stored for transportation, and a delicious meal at home.   I don't like to think too much about the sanitary problems that may or may not exist with this place because I love it so much. Good news is that they've expanded once again, so the wait at lunch for a table won't be so brutal.

The food was delicious... just the right amount of spice. We shared the homemade coconut ice cream for dessert, which was also great. The owner was adorable too. She made a point to come by and talk to us at length about food, travel and Thailand. An overall great experience!

Since it's already a well-established point that this place has delicious food at an excellent value, I'll simply provide a few bulleted remarks:  Great Original Paintings Sweet & fresh faced Guadalajaran transplant at counter Amazing Strawberry Salsa (WTF -- who knew?)  New favorite pinto beans in town (sorry America's Taco Shop) Not a fan of the Dogshark taco Chicken Mole & Conchinita were T'Asty Generously portioned $6.99 2 taco combination entree is UNBEATABLE  I went in at 1pm, and the place was empty.  With all these great Yelp reviews, where are all the sophisticated, bargain hunting peeps with a hankering for delicious Mexican in a town notoriously lacking in this?

I can't wait to go back and try more!   Casual and classic atmosphere. Polite, professional and knowledgeable staff. Plus, their 1/2 off any bottle of Rose on Sunday is a real treat!    Apps -   Grits with Schreiners sausage...... painfully good Chx meatballs with smoky tomato sauce..... even more painfully delicious Zucchini pancakes.... yummy, but not something I'd order again. The texture was off for me, and the goddess sauce wasn't very punchy Razz chops salad... no thanks, not my cup of tea. would not repeat.   Dinner -  Fork tender short ribs were out of this world tender & flavorful. Beautiful green & yellow bean with a soft potato mash beneath. Delightful!  It seems like they have a really high standard for themselves and take pride in what they do. I respect that, and like the dining experience created by following that ethic.

This place has a really great scaled back elegance. I love the energy that the large bar in the center of the space creates. My only complaint is that the lack of soft surfaces contributes to an incredibly loud atmosphere.  On to the food! I've had the mussels there twice. Each time prepared differently. Each time delicious, hearty, and perfect for soaking up the broth with their airy bread.   Their 'Original Chopped Salad' is definitely a must order! There are several textures and flavors in this salad that individually stand out, but also peacefully come together to create a memorable and satisfying moment on your palette.   My experience so far is that I'm a huge fan of everything on the left side of the menu (small plates, apps, salads,etc). It's not that the sandwiches and entrees (only tried the roasted chx) weren't nicely prepared, but they just aren't to my taste. Too much flavor, or not enough. Not a fan of their fries.   Their wine selection is fantastic. There is a great range of varietals and price points to choose from.  The service is wonderfully friendly! All the staff that I've encountered are very knowledgeable about the wines and the menu.  Lastly... the owner is cute! Had to say it.

I loved everything about this place. I would have loved to have more of a selection on the food at the time that we went (they don't serve salads after 3pm), but overall the wine, service, and the food that we did order were all exceptional.  The design elements are very thoughtfully selected. I admire that the owners have created something completely unique to their tastes, and aren't trying to ape something they saw in an LA/NY restaurant.   A Phoenix gem!

It's no surprise that the businesses around this place have lines & full parking lots, and this place has the buzz of zero interest.  I woke up with a craving for a fresh bagel this morning, and decided to walk over to Everything Bagels.   I walked in at 7:20 to a place with no sign of life. The display case was nearly empty, and there were very few bagels in baskets. I thought maybe they were closed. I was about to leave when an older man stepped out of the back. I asked if they were open, to which he gruffly responded, "yes, the door was open, wasn't it"? I was taken off guard by his rudeness, and apologized, and simply told him that it didn't seem like they were open yet. He said, "you're fine", as if I was the rude dumb-ass. He proceeded to lecture me on the fact that he was the only one there, and that he had many things he had to do all by himself. Here's some free advice dude --- it takes 2 seconds to make a card that says, "In back. I'll be with you in a moment".   At this point, all I want to do is order something, and get the hell out of there. THEN, he asks me if I want a drink. I ask him how the iced coffee is served, to which he patronizingly says, "well, I give you a cup of ice, and you can poor the medium or dark roast over it". When I decline, he says, "do you mind telling me why you dont' like coffee over ice"?.  More free advice - - It's stinking hot here, and you have to be totally clueless not to offer your customers a descent iced coffee during a Phoenix summer.  Since he asked me why I don't like they way they serve it, I tell him that I don't like pouring hot coffee over ice because it just melts the ice cubes, and makes the drink watery. ---- DUH!  I then muster all the politeness I have to ask him if he has every had toddy coffee. I mention that it's smooth, delicious & easy to make.  He goes on this diatribe about all the water that is required to make a toddy coffee taste good. I make toddy coffee at home all the time, and he clearly didn't know what the heck he was talking about. It takes time, but not a huge amount of water. HUGE SURPRISE --- When I asked him if he had ever had toddy coffee, he said he had not. The take-away from this is that hot coffee over ice is bad. However you get your hands on cold brew is up to you, but a cold brew over ice is a key component to iced coffee.   Summary: Customer service is key. If you don't have it, then you don't have my business.

So horribly disappointing, as per usual. Ordered 2 regular size bean and cheese burritos, a large order of chips and guac. and a Dasani water. This came to $17! A ridiculous price point for fast food Mex, but what made it worse is that the tortillas smelled like plastic. Our finger tips literally stunk like some weird chemical that was laced into the tortillas. The beans and cheese were tasteless. Which was just as well, because after I discovered the plastic smell was coming from my tortilla, I couldn't even finish. They only gave us 1 tiny salsa for 2 burritos. F'ing weird. Lastly, the chips were inedibly stale.   I would have taken everything back and demanded my money, but it was take-out, and we were too far away when we discovered everything mentioned above.   Hoping for a decent order at the counter place to open in it's place. A girl can dream. Until that happens, I'll just have to drive a little further to La Santisima.

Had a business lunch there today, and definitely will not be returning for the food. I heard whispers about town that the food at this Vig was going to be better than their other locations. So, I was excited to give this one a shot, as I have totally given up on their other locations for anything other than drinks, and light snacks.  The outside eating area and bar are just perfect for the fall weather. The design is simple, cohesive, friendly & warm. The praise stops there.  We ordered chips & guac. The chips tasted like they were fried in old oil, and the guac had a flavor that certainly wasn't guac-licious... more on the verge of going bad.   One person joining us had the deconstructed tacos, which she barely touched, as the fish was more like fish jerky, and the side of beans totally tasteless. I shared the "best turkey sandwich" with someone, and had high expectations with a name like that. It was a soggy mess of flavors. None of the ingredients stuck out, and it quickly fell apart after the first bite.   Nothing was exceptional. Sort of bummed by the experience, but at least it will be a fun place to grab a beer on a lovely fall evening.

New Direction Fertility exceeded all of our expectations. Dr. Amols and his staff were compassionate, professional and effective. I would recommend them time and time again. Their rates are so reasonable, and that really takes away from the stress of going through treatment. I can say from experience that the New Direction Office is one of the nicest and most state of the art fertility clinics I have ever visited. I'd give them 10 stars if I could.

Wendy is very professional and very talented. My husband and I have used her and agree that she gives an excellent massage. We both feel so wonderful after a session with her. Also, we love that she does house calls as we love our home, and after a busy week it's such a luxury to have her visit us in the comfort of our own home.  Lastly, she is WONDERFUL for prenatal too. I was experience sciatica in one of my legs, and after 2 sessions the pain is gone. Wendy is the BEST!

I wish I could give negative stars. Not worth the cheap price tag. Extremely long waits on tarmac. 61 minute flight plus 50 minutes waiting on the tarmac. Last minute delays, gate changes, poor customer service. Super scary landings each time... never again.
