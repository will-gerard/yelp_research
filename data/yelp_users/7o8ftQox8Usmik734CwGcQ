My friend wanted to have her birthday dinner somewhere special, and unfortunately we were very disappointed with Bobby's.  Herein lies a list of grievances:  * Unorganized hostess and manager. We only knew the birthday girl, so we didn't know what the other guests would look like. We thought it wouldn't be an issue, but even with us providing the manager with the name on the reservation, she couldn't tell us where we were seated or if anyone from our party had arrived.  * Misrepresentation. The birthday girl called to make sure there would be live jazz, but the whole night featured a bad Latin fusion group instead.  * Crowded. There were too many tables and chairs crammed into the main downstairs room. Guests could not freely leave the table on one side without bumping into other patrons.  * Awkward. The chairs are too short for the table height; both men and women at our table had to uncomfortably perch at the edge of their seats to reach their food. The menus are also too large in dimension (or again there are too many seats crammed together) as we couldn't even hold our menus open without smacking each other.  * Rude. Our waitress was short with us and pushy about getting our orders. Also, she seemed angry when we asked if we could get a photo of our group celebrating a birthday. While we posed for our group photo, a couple waiters didn't just clear our plates -- they actually had the gall to clear all of our coats, jackets and phones by throwing them into a pile at one end of the table. That was really weird! Why are the waiters touching our purses and cell phones?  The one good thing: * The pistachio crusted lamb chop was delicious; it's the only reason this rating has one star.

This place has exceeded my expectations every time I've visited.  I've experienced brunch and dinner at St. Francis and have been impressed with everything I've ordered (and everything my friends have let me sneak bites of!).  For brunch, the Homemade Biscuit (with vegetable gravy) was perfection. I'm no stranger to fatty breakfasts, and was really impressed by the richness of this dish. On a separate occasion, I enjoyed a mimosa with my Iron Skillet Pancake (perfect amount of sweetness with the chocolate and berries) and an order of scrambled eggs. No need to add salt -- Chef Aaron Chamberlain gets it right. I'm known to judge a breakfast by its eggs and this one was fluffy and the perfect break from my sweet pancake adventure. I topped it off by splitting their GIANT cinnamon roll with my friend. Even the two of us couldn't finish it!  The live Jazz is a classy touch, and the perfect backdrop for a Sunday rendezvous.  I've had dinner on a few occasions and ordered their Roasted Salmon, Steak, and Pot Roast. All cooked to order (and cooked to perfection). Paul prefers his steak "moo"-ing. I prefer mine a little more... umm... cooked. Both were great. The pot roast has been my favorite. My advice is to pair any of these dishes with their signature Cucumber Cooler (which includes some legit Hendricks Gin and is garnished with a cucumber).  The service has been wonderful and prompt every time I've visited. On my most recent dinner there, our server noticed I was wearing a black dress and asked if I would prefer a black napkin over a white one. I asked why, and he replied that the white ones shed and he would hate for me to get lint all over my dress. That's the kind of consideration that really makes the service at St. Francis shine.  Combine the amazing food and great service with gorgeous, modern decór... and I'd say you have a winning restaurant.  I'm so excited for their new weekday breakfast schedule and the espresso bar/café that's going to be added. I'll be headed back to St. Francis for sure.

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to call and schedule an appointment for a cleaning/check-up. I was impressed that I could download and fill out my new patient forms ahead of time -- a big time saver.  My first impression when I pulled up was how lovely their office is. It's a refurbished home from the 50's (I think) so it's charming on the outside with a very professional, welcoming, and tranquil interior.  I was greeted by a very nice staff member who helped me get acquainted with the office by taking me around for a tour.   Some amenities to note: * Comfy waiting area with coffee and water * A computer free for patients to use to check email or waste some time online if you show up early for your appointment. * Televisions over the exam room chairs (my hygienist handed me a remote to watch a show while my x-rays were scanning).  Dr. Tran and the hygienist I had were very observant throughout the exam/cleaning. They asked good questions and offered useful feedback. I felt as though any concerns I had were listened to and taken into account (ex. I had a sensitive tooth. They made sure to check it for a crack and were very diligent to minimize discomfort when scraping/flossing my teeth).  Top notch service and the newest dental instruments. Much more up-to-date and welcoming than my previous dental office. I definitely recommend this place! (They even sent me a handwritten Thank You card after my first visit)

My rubric for a coffee shop is pretty simple. The first and most important question is "How's the coffee?"  I ordered a regular drip coffee and the barista (who was very nice and eager to answer my questions) served it to me... cold. The hot drip coffee was cold. And it tasted burnt. Bad on two counts.  My cohort ordered an espresso and was served promptly. Unfortunately, his espresso was also subpar due to it's over-extraction.  The furniture was mismatched (but not in that fun, quirky way... more of a "we stopped by a garage sale and this is what we found" way). The light fixtures were interesting but cast shadows directly on the artwork. Typically, I'd say that's bad form. On a positive note, the concrete floors were nice, and I was partial to their rugs.  Their menus looked like a ripoff of Lux's glass window pane menus, but their merch area felt like a cross section of a duty-free airport gift shop. Pairing that with the chairs from various time periods and places, Urban Beans felt like it was trying to be several different shops at once.  If you try to please everybody, you'll please nobody.

Sometimes I take a risk and try out coffee shops that I've never heard of just to satisfy my curiosity. Let me say, there is a reason I've never heard of this place.  This is a coffee shop that seems to exist because someone thought it would be an easy way to start a business, not because someone was actually interested in serving good quality coffee.  I will keep it short and devote my post to giving you my main qualms about Dolce.  1. The coffee was badly roasted and bitter. I don't know where they get their beans (maybe I don't want to know), but the coffee was of lowest quality and showed a lack of regard for the industry. If you're a coffee shop your main purpose is to have good coffee.  2. My iced latte was littered with coffee grounds. There should NEVER be bits of coffee in your coffee drink. At my first sip, the latte was so horribly bitter and burnt tasting I wondered why it tasted like smoke... it was the coffee grounds being sucked up through my straw and onto my palate. Even when I isolated the problem, pulled up the straw and tried my latte without shards of coffee... it wasn't good (hence point #1).  3. The ambiance is that of a nightclub trying to be a coffee shop. There is a time and place to watch Lil' Wayne music videos... and that time is not when I want to try to enjoy my horribly bitter latte. The couches were old and ripped and looked like rejects from someone's old bachelor pad.

FnB is one of the best restaurants in Arizona. I have been consistently impressed with their delectable dishes comprised of fresh local ingredients. Pavle and Charleen are certainly an amazing team and it's clear that each of them is passionate about what they do. Pavle's hospitality and knowledge shine as he takes you through the menu and makes sure you're comfortable and well taken care of throughout the evening. Charleen is a master in the kitchen and turns out the most amazing plates. Veggies never tasted so good!  The atmosphere is intimate yet fun. From the moment you enter FnB you're treated as a friend. I've been a happy customer since it's near beginnings, and I've always had a perfect experience when dining there.  As far as menu specifics? Get the butterscotch pudding! Even if you weren't expecting to get dessert you shouldn't pass it up. Also, most of the time, my husband and I go the small plate route (and maybe order an entree to split as well). We love how everything sounds--and we're pretty good about sharing--so we find that ordering small plates is the most exciting dining experience for us. If you're not so experienced with wine, don't worry! Pavle will help you. I told him I had no idea what I liked with wine and he responded, "Of course you know what you like! If you know what you like in food, you know what you like in wine." Again, the unshakably friendly demeanor you can expect at FnB, even if you're not an experienced oenophile.

The Main Ingredient is one of those downtown staples that I used to visit every week when I lived just around the corner. My favorite sandwich is the Jive Turkey (it's ridiculously good), followed by the Cash Money (yum). The chips and salsa are also worth noshing on.  Once famous for the Gordon on their drink menu, they have mixed it up a bit with the Gordon equivalent G'Knight. I'm not sure if they're back to serving Gordon yet, but if so, do it! TMI also has the best Happy Hour in town on Mondays.  If you're just there for drinks with a friend, grab the tiny sofa! If you're there with a bunch of friends, snag an outside patio table; it's casual and the best place to have conversation. It's also extra fun when it gets colder in the fall---they bring out the firepits!  All in all, this is one of the best places to have a tasty casual meal in downtown. Grab a beer and enjoy!

Lee's Cream Liqueur is such a fun concept offering a tasty product. A group of friends and I walked over to Lee's after an event at Cartel. It was just before their closing time, so I was nervous that we would be hurried to make our selections, but the ladies working were so nice and offered us samples of their different flavors. And when we sat outside, they told us to take our time and not worry about hurrying to empty our table.  Most of us ordered the Chocolate Black Russian Kahlua, which came garnished with a generously sized wafer. Delicious, creamy, and just the right amount of alcohol flavor! A couple people ordered the Butterscotch Long Island, and I snagged a bite. It was also great and not overpowering.  The only reason I knocked off a star is that the layout of their shop is a bit sparse and could use some more seating and maybe even a fun couch for larger groups; but I understand that in Old Town most people will just get their ice cream and walkabout, anyway.  Make sure to bring your ID! You don't want to miss out on the alcohol-infused fun. Lee's is a great new option if you're looking for an offbeat iced treat.

If you haven't been to Brosenbrus Cafe, you need to try it. Now!  The giant menu on the wall really makes a statement and, fortunately, the guys have the food to back it up. I tried the White Boy Torta and absolutely loved it. My first trip was with a bunch of coworkers and all eight of us left raving about the food.  The interior design and furniture is really beautiful and what I like to call "unsourced." I love walking into a well-designed space and not being able to spot anything from IKEA. A major plus in my book.  I went in around Christmas and the giant antlers on the wall were decked out in tinsel and ornaments... I love that the guys working there have such a great sense of humor! The Brosenbrus staff is friendly, approachable, and seem to care about the quality of what they make -- not just about being trendy.  This truly is a great find; Go see for yourself. They have a small parking lot just behind the shop so it's easy parking even though it's right by ASU.  ********  I'm updating my review because now that Brosenbrus is serving Cartel coffee, they've really upped their game. Make sure to get some of that delicious iced toddy with your food!

I wanted to love this place because I had heard great things from friends, but unfortunately my husband and I were disappointed in our experience.  We started off the night well with a warm and welcoming server. It felt as though they really appreciated their customers choosing to dine with them. Also, the decor was fantastic. We loved the open floor plan, wood beam ceilings, and the glassware.  For our appetizer, we ordered the "Mac 'N' Cheese" with crispy pancetta--delicious! We could have not been more pleased with that dish. It was delectable, but not heavy or greasy at all. The pancetta was perfection.  For drinks, my husband ordered the "Legend City Cocktail" which he said was great. I ordered "Miss Katie's Pimms Cup" (clearly one of the most girly drinks on the menu) and I really enjoyed it. So far, so good.  Then the main dishes. This is where Beckett's Table lost us. I ordered the "Fork Tender Short Ribs". They were okay, not awesome, and I have definitely had better at a few other places. The short ribs were tender enough but not well seasoned, and the vegetables were too raw and not cooked long enough. I was disappointed because I felt I could make the same dish, only better and cheaper, at home. My husband ordered the "Chicken 'N' Dumplings" which was also a let down. The chef did not add any salt or seasonings to the dish, so it was very bland. We thought it was possibly a mistake, so after adding enough salt to flavor, we mentioned it to the server. We felt like he was giving us a bit of story, because after some hesitation he said "Oh well, maybe I didn't mention it, but this is one of our more mild dishes." Meh. Even if that is the truth, that doesn't make it any better of a dish. Also, the vegetables in it were hard--the carrots and celery should be tender, not crunchy and raw.  In the end, if we ever return to Beckett's Table it would be solely for cocktails, not food. Nice atmosphere, but the quality does not match up to the pricing.

Janet Kirkman is truly a master seamstress. When I arrived for my first fitting, I felt completely comfortable with her. She gave me a very affordable estimate for altering my trumpet-style wedding gown--a range of $285-$325, I believe.  My dress needed to be sized down, have boning added to the bodice, cups for the bust, be shortened/hemmed, have a three-point American bustle added, and have some stitching redone since I got it at the Bridal Convention. She also noticed indicators that the dress had not been cleaned, even though the boutique claimed to have cleaned it (ugh), so she threw in the cleaning and final pressing for a discount. All told, the final cost was only $315! Hearing other crazy estimates, I had braced myself for spending up to $500, so I was pleased.  I had three fittings with Janet and every time she was professional, personable, and a joy to work with. I felt that she valued my input and asked very good questions about the wedding and my style to gauge the changes she would make to the dress. In the end, my dress fit perfectly! I got amazing compliments and looked/felt very beautiful on my wedding day. My groom absolutely loved how it perfectly fit my shape!

While I love having a fancy dish at Essence, it's nice to finally have an option for an all-American style breakfast in Tempe that isn't IHOP.  Though often crowded on the weekends, the servers really do a great job of clearing off tables quickly, and checking in to make sure all is well with your dishes. I have been there over 10 times, and have never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table to open up.  I think the only confusing aspect of the restaurant is how your food is ordered. A few times I have been waiting in line to order at the main registers, when servers at the secondary registers (next to the drink bar) have asked people behind me for their orders. It just feels weird to be standing ahead of someone in line, only to hear them get their order in before you. A couple times, it left me feeling as though NCounter wasn't well organized and a bit put off that my food wait time was increased even though I was ahead in line. That's the reason I have knocked off one star from my rating.  I just learned, though, that you can also order food online. My husband went to pickup an online order and showed up 5-6 minutes early to just be safe and the food was already packed up and waiting. I did wonder how long it had been sitting there before being picked up. Perhaps NCounter would do better if these online orders were 2 minutes late instead of 10 minutes early. Just a suggestion.  The food, though, is fantastic! My favorite items to order include:  * Eggs, Toast, and Grilled Potatoes ($5.50)--simple and tasty, make sure to ask for some extra jam! * Classic Eggs Benedict ($8)--Delicious! * French Toast ($5.50) * The Pear Omelette ($8)--you can't beat this brie and bacon combination.
