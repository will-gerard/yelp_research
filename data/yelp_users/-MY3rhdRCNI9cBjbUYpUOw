Was hung up on twice by a lady named Jamie, I guess they have more business than they can handle.

I recommend you find another place to work out.  The facilities are decent, but equipment is still outdated after the renovations that closed the gym down for at least 3 weeks.  (I still have not been reimbursed for that).  The worst part of the gym is the staff and management.  For 2 weeks I've been trying to cancel my membership because I'm moving and apparently only one person in the whole building with at least a dozen staff working at a time can do it.  This "Tanis" woman is never there, just some young poorly trained kids.  I guess they like to give you the run around time and time again so they can soak you for membership fees.  Find another gym!!!

I visited Wolfley's for the first time this week for a send off party for a friend that was moving and was really impressed!  Lots of great beer on tap and the appetizers were really tasty!  Loved the Southwestern Rolls in particular...  The staff was very fast and efficient and the manager was gracious enough to help me out of a little predicament.  I'll definitely be going back when I'm in that part of town... fantastic experience!

Julio did a fantastic job fixing my cracked iPhone 6 screen and was a big help fixing a possible Apple defect with the casing a few months later.  Definitely recommend you take your phones here should the need arise!
