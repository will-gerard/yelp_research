Having such a good reputation, I was a bit disappointed with my last trip.  My boyfriend and I have a VW that is often occupied by our amazing American Bulldog Cashmere.  There was a good buildup of his fur in the backseat so we decided to spend the money and get a full detail on the car.  Upon arrival, they told us that it would be ready at 3pm.  Then it was later changed to 4pm.  After arriving at 4pm, my BF waiting another hour for our car to be finished.  Upon completion, the employee said :"You really need to get a different dog, because it took us so long because of all of the dog hair in the backseat."   IM SORRY THAT MY $150 WAS A BIT TIME CONSUMING FOR YOU TO FINISH THE JOB WE PAYED FOR.  I maybe would have understood if we would have purchased the lowest wash/clean or something, but we bought the most expensive...so if you really expect a car not to be a bit dirty, maybe you shouldn't work at a car wash?  I'm just saying, it was a bit insulting.

I'm not sure why I even tried giving this business another shot. What a waste of time.   They advertise for window tinting, so my husband and I decided to go in for a quote and possibly schedule a time to do it. We asked for a price quote from the counter and with the price and the brand of tint they use, we were happy and decided to schedule a time immediately. At that point, the lady at the counter said she needed to call the guy that did the tinting. [sketch moment #1]  She called and he was apparently able to come in immediately, which at that point was fine, we just needed to run our last errand before we got stuck there for several hours. As we were leaving, we were informed that we had to pay in cash, and couldn't use a card because this individual doesn't actually work for the car wash......we explained that we didn't have cash on us, and the lady at the counter kept insisting that we could just go get some cash. [sketch moment #2]  After we left, we had gotten such a bad vibe from that, we decided to not go along with the appointment and immediately called to cancel. During that phone call I explained that we were no longer to to get the window tint (this was within 5 minutes of us leaving there) and THEN, she tells me that they CAN take a card for payment!   What the hell kind of business are you running? They also claim to have a warranty on the tint, but if the jobs are being completed by someone who doesn't even work for the car wash, who is in charge of covering any type of warranty? NEVER AGAIN. This isn't breaking bad, stop trying to do shady work.

This is my absolute favorite favorite place now!! Everything we've had has been great but our go to dish is the Molcajete Caliente and I will probably never steer away from it. The sauce? BOMB. The tortillas? BOMB. The octopus? BOMB.

There has been so much anticipation to go to G&D for Karaokee on mondays.  After a great bbq we all decided to go and sing our hearts out...well we arrived at about 10pm...added our names to the list...cheered othered singers on to encourage a good time, spent some money and tipped well....and waited patiently....well after 2.5 hours have gone by we had seen the same three girls go up the several times before we have...we get it...if they got there before us and signed up, its their turn...but then the host started singing songs and kept picking "random" chicks to sings songs...ok...now its getting weird.  Then when we saw the person that signed up right before us go up and then one of the same "three" girls and then the host "randomly" pick again.....we got pissed of and were ready to leave.  We were pissed and cashed out.  Then when we told the karaokee host that he was an ass and that we had been waiting over 2 hrs and were pissed, he pretty much talked crap and walked away.  Then he had the nerve to call our names when we walked right out of the door.  We came back in and talked to management.  We were there to have a good time and spend money.  I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Star karaokee sux, IDK what the hell Michael the Karaokee host from star karaokee's problem was, but he was completely unprofessional and just plain RUDE.  We get it, you have your regulars, but we are cusotmers too.....we would have brought more people back in the future...but you can have fun with the same three people for your pitiful karaokee night.

I've tried so hard after countless opportunities that you guys had just to be an acceptable go to bike shop...you've failed just about every time.  Horrible customer service countless times, jobs not performed during the time frame they had presented, which was not much of a big issue, but the fact that they never informed me that they never started the work after leaving a bike there for over three days.  I get it, you're busy.  But if you keep telling me it will be done today, I'll assume it'll be done.  If you tell me you can work on it, I'll assume you'll work on it.  And when I call to figure out what's going on, don't cut me off and expect me not to be an angry customer.  But I'm sure I get it, you're happy with your repeat customers and don't plan on getting/keeping new ones.  Thanks anyway.

They're food is really good.  And the staff is so fun and polite.  They have an awesome happy hour that is from 3-6 on weekdays where you get sushi and beer and some appetizer's for half off which is hard to beat.  The sauce for the udon noodles is really good too....and if you like spicy, the spicy korean noodles are really good as well.  All in all, its a great place.

I have an mk4 gtik 1.8t. I took my car there to have a rattle in the suspension fixed. They found a bunch of other stuff wrong with my car which sucked... But they where all legitimate problems. The funniest part is the repairs that where being done where cause by a poor mechanic at one the of the east valley's VW "tuning shops". The high prices suck, but I got a loaner car and I only had to take it there once and it was fixed. I've become so used to running back and forth everytime I have something done to my car I thought it was normal. They did good work, they offer loaner cars, and they fixed it the first time. I've also had good experiences with the parts department.

Looked at the rating and thought it would be exciting....but nothing at all special.  The huevos rancheros SUCKED.  Very bland, nothing great at all.  We also got some dish that was mushrooms, cheese and spinach on a bialy (but they were out so it was on a english muffin)  not bad.  But for like $10 I and tons of good reviews, I would expect more than just tortillas from a bag on the side of over easy eggs and like 2 pieces of avocado.

the owner is worthless... i spent 8 hours straight tinting their bus (no lunch, no bathroom breaks, no breaks period!) trying to get their bus tinted on short notice at that... what do i get get for payment? NOTHING!!! the owner and his employee (which are both twice my size) try to haggle the price down to nothing. finally when the price goes so low my time was better spent taking all the tint off, they both corner me in the bus and tell me if i don't leave they're going to throw me off the bus... sounds crazy right? my only advice is carry a firearm if you're a private business owner, because the cops are going to tell you to file a lawsuit and take it up in court... nothing like working a full day in the arizona heat for no pay... i hope the owner burns in hell in that fu*&^ng bus...

My girlfriend and I where totally lied to by everyone we talked to. Finally someone from finacial aid pulled me into a side office away from the enrollment counselors and pointed out bachelor's degree would cost a minimum of 90k... I recieve the maxium amount of grants and loans, I still would have have to pay over $1000 out of pocket every month to cover tuition... Throughout the course of the meeting I consistantly asked why my finacial wouldn't cover the total cost of tuition when at other schools (that cost the same per credit hour) I would be getting a refund to help cover the cost of housing. Everytime I asked it no one would answer me... They just tried to push me to the point of signing papers and paying the application fee... I went home, got online and did my own research, the reason their tuition ends up being more per degree is because they make you take 60 more credit hours... FOR THE SAME DEGREE!!!! If i was going to 90k for an undergraduate degree I would attend an Ivy league school... F$%^ THAT SCHOOL... The best part is when the enrollment counselor could see that I wasn't going to sign or pay anything until I did my own research, she started getting super aggressive to the point if she wasn't a girl the meeting probably would have ended voilently... How can she even get mad at me? If they wouldn't have lied to me in the beginning I wouldn't have been there... The situation felt like I was being screwed by a used car salesman...

Went with a big group of people from work and I must say, this is a cool place...I love their oatmeal stout but decided to go with the hefeweizen.  The waitress was accommodating to splitting all of our checks up for us which was nice.  I didn't go crazy with what I ordered and just had a craving for wings, but for an appetizer sized portion it was great...lot of carrots and celery to go with!  It would be a little more enjoyable in the cooler months, but all it all, I'll be back soon.

If you dont already know that you're going to wait then you must not know what you're getting yourself into.  Don't complain about, because we've all told you.  This is the place that you go to if you are a person who appreciates good food, therefore, it takes time.  Dough is simple, but cooked to perfection with the perfect balance of ingredients that puts it all together.  We had the wise guy and the fennel sausage is sooo good.  So, if you have time, it's worth the wait.  If you walk around downtown or something, the wait doesn't seem so bad.

Excuse me...but these sandwiches are AWESOME!! You get a delicious 10" sandwich for like $2.50!  How can you beat that? The baguettes are soo crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, which is awesome since they make it there.  The only reason that I give it one less star, is because they only take cash.

I can't beleive this place doesn't have more reviews.  A group of us had gone for cocktails and wanted to do something a little different, so we decided to go to Compass.  I live in downtown Phoenix and I absolutely love it, but after seeing the gorgeous view from Compass, I love it even more.  The staff is professional and the drinks are very reasonably priced.  I will hope to be able to put 5 stars after I have dinner from here.

Meh....its really cool looking for just drinks and a good time...I didn't like the food very much at all.  I had the street tacos and just wasn't too happy with the quality of the food...I don't know if it sat too long, or if thats just how it always is?  But the fish pieces were really good!  The service could be a little better, but overall its OK.

I don't think I'll be going back.  I went in for an eyebrow wax after seeing some positive reviews on yelp.  Got in immediately with Carmen, and as soon as I walked in, she kept talking about how bad my acne was and that I should do something about it.  Ok, I get it, she's trying to sell me a chemical peel, facial, whatever, but then she just kept being so annoyingly judgemental.  She just wouldn't stop talking about how bad my face was and how I should always pencil in my eyebrows even if I dont wear makeup.  She waxed me then plucked some pieces of my skin off.  Then made it a point to pencil in my eyebrows which just made me look like an idiot.  Was not happy at all and will not go back.

I love love loooove cold stone.  It's our first destination when we decide that we want ice cream.  I don't know what it is about this location...the service is always so...I don't want to say horrible...but it's always awkward.  The staff just kind of continues to talk amongst themselves when you enter the store...as if they don't know why you're in there.  We always ride our bikes to the store being that we live nearby, and we always ask that we can take it to go.  After we request it to go, the hand it to us, open top and a spoon.  Then we have to ask them for each individual thing...we have to ask for lids...then we have to ask for a bag.  Either way, we'll always go back because they serve ice cream...but it's just like a hard core awkward off in there.

Bf and i went today and the pho was REALLY good.  You really didn't have to add anything to the broth to make it taste good because it was already perfect.  4 Stars because we had pho and some spare ribs, and all the meat that we had was a little tough.  And it was completely dead, so I didn't really like the ambiance.  It was all awkward trying not to slurp noodles too loud because there wasn't that much sound going on lol.  And after we got our meal no one stopped by to see if we needed anything really, and when we were done we just kind of sat there and didn't know if we were supposed to walk up to the counter or what.  But other than that it was really good.

Living in the Roosevelt District, our household was really excited to see that this was opening up.  We thought it was a great concept that we could take advantage of being that we both work and go to school.  Went for the first time today and were really disappointed.  Ordered the Rack of Lamb with Cauliflower Parmesan Crush & Green Beans, for $16 it was not well worth it.  Although I am a true believer in paying for good quality food, there was really not much food to try in order to find out!  There were two pieces of lamb, literally 3 green beans, and more mashed cauliflower than anything.  It was ok, but I wasn't very satisfied.  For an establishment that advertises meals to go, I expected their pricing to be about the same, if not less than a restaurant, but I could have went to a sit down restaurant and paid the same amount for way more food that tastes a bit better.    FG2G - I really hope that you guys could do a little better than this because we really want to be able to support your business, but I can't say that we were happy with the food for the price we paid.  Until then, we wont be going back :(

By far the best pho in town.  I think we've actually gone like 3 times in one week!  The place is so clean and the staff is so friendly.  We've tried several different things everytime we've gone (along with our pho of course) and I don't think we've had anything we were disappointed with.

I like this place.  Came here for the first time today and everything is just simple.  You're not paying for pretty packaging....it is what it is!  And I like how the meat/fish have the stickers that show when you should cook/consume by on them.  I really like the prepared meals also.  If you read the ingredients, they're actual ingredients, not preservatives and chemical crap.  Pricing is reasonable, all in all, I like this place!

I don't know what the hell everyone bitches about.  You can't get a better price for the prime location...if you want something cheaper, go somewhere a little less downtown with no ac.  The maintenance can be...eh...sometimes, but when you look at the overall maintenance on the entire complex, they actually do it.  They repainted the buildings, inside and out, they clean the hallways once a week (if they really need to do more than that, thats just the occupants probably that they messy...they're freaking hallways) and they have security now.  I've been living here for over two years and I'm happy.  The people in the office are nice, and they do tend to mess up things, or forget things...but i've never had them forget about any BIG problems that I've had since I lived here.  The messes and loud noise are from annoying tenants..but you have to know that moving into an apartment complex downtown in a large city.  It's going to be noisy on first friday, it's going to be noisy from the neighbor above you...welcome to downtown living people.  The only big problem that I have is the dog poop and pee that are around the complex...but that's from negligent dog owners, because I've seen maintenance clean it up in the mornings.

I am VERY disappointed with how much the quality of this residence has gone down. I get it....you've changed management companies.....but we're the people that have to live here and continue to pay premium pricing for not so premium living. For starters, the community room that we used to be able to rent for about $75-$100, now through berkshire requires a $400 deposit. Makes no sense, we freaking live here. Although it was great that its a dog friendly community, there are a lot of negligent dog owners who don't clean up after their dogs, and the maintenance/cleaning team does not address this....so you walk around and it smells like dog urine and there is feces everywhere. At least when it was greystar, they used to pick it up and would spray the trees with water to ease the smell. The gates in the A building are always broken, the front doors are always broken, the key sensors are always broken. When you go into the office to pickup packages or pay rent, (being that they charge a $10 fee if you pay online monthly, which is a total joke) you sit in the front office for a ridiculous amount of time before anyone addresses you....theres no: "someone will be right with you or anything". The only person that I am even happy dealing with in the office is Colby, he's the only one that seems to really try to do whats best for the residents. I don't know what I pay so much for anymore, its really disappointing. We've lived here for about 2 1/2 years and have just had it.

Purchased a yelp deal and thought we would check them out! We got a couple soups, and sandwiches. The food seems overpriced for the quality and quantity. The decor is awful and the tables and seats were uncomfortable. All in all, I was not impressed.

The selection and the food is awesome.  Great for our household with full time workers and full time students!  Their stuffed shells are by far my favorite and they are VERY reasonably priced.  Staff for the most part are very friendly, there is one kid there that just seems completely clueless - for example we called ahead to get an order put together, and he just gave the phone to someone else without saying anything to us on the phone...yea...really awkward moment.  But for the most part, we love it here.

Not much of a hang out in Scottsdale person, but we happened to stumble on a Groupon for this place one day.  (And it was an awesome Groupon)  The place had a very nice atmosphere and decor, and we went a little earlier so it wasn't super busy.  I always feel bad for the servers that get those groupons because I know some assholes dont tip very well when bills are discounted, but our server Zach, was upbeat and very helpful in helping us pick out menu items.  The quality of the fish was excellent.  The spicy tuna on the rice cake thing was soooooooo good.  This place is definitely pricey, but if you can afford it, its definitely worth it.

Good healthy eats where everything is organic.  But if eating organic food is not totally up your alley then it may seem a bit more expensive.  I got the tuna sashimi salad which was really to die for.  It was a nice size for me because Im not a heavy eater.  Boyfriend got some steak tacos which were really good but you pay about $15 for only 2 small tacos.

Stopped out for some drinks for a friends bday and was not impressed.  The service was quite uncomfortable...the server moved sooo slow, and the restaurant wasn't very busy.  When I ordered a beloved Estrella Damn Lager, the server had no idea what I was asking for and responded with a big : "HUH?!"  Then he dropped off the beer, started to walk away THEN asked for my ID.  Akward.....then we were all ready for our bills, it took him forever to come around...when we finally saw him near our table, someone from the party had to flag him down because he wasn't going to stop by.  Then after collecting payments from everyone, it took about 10 minutes for him to bring them all back.  The server seemed quite overwhelmed by our party of 10 that mostly ordered beer and appetizers.

Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  My bf and I go all the time for brunch, and they also have really good burgers too.  My favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio.  They usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie!  Try the coca cola ham omelet for brunch....AH-MAZING!

Very good variety of several different asian regions.  Obviously not as big as Lee Lee's in Chandler, but obviously the best in the area.  Even the homeless guy that lives around there is polite! lol J/K  But it's pretty much a nice sized asian market when looking for your ingredients for asian cooking that you can't find at the grocery store.  Also pretty good coffee selection.

Called them for a quote on printing services (which I have gone elsewhere to spend about $600 on).  Person on the phone had no idea as far as pricing, discounts, or anything, so he asked if he could email me the quote.  I was fine with that, I totally understand if you're busy and need some time.  But, I never received an email or a call back.

This place is amazing.  The ambiance is great and it has such a romantic feel in case you guys need to take your ladies out somewhere nice.  The hubby and I got one dish from each category and everything was delicious and so nicely presented.  The service was great with the server giving wonderful recommendations.  We had the Tako age, shiromi carpaccio which was by far my fave, and the soft shell crab sandwiches.  It's on the pricey side but its great quality tapas.

My boyfriend and I bought two groupons for brick and thought we would give it a shot.  The first time we went it was ok.  Service was good, food was not extraordinary, but not bad.  The decor is real cute and comfortable so we thought it could be a good place to hang out.  Then when we went by the second time, I ordered the gorgonzola salad, and my bf ordered a pizza.  When I got my salad I had found a little hair in it.  No big deal, I moved it off my plate, then continued to eat.  It didn't really bother me, I get it, it can happen, whatever.  Then I found another hair!  Then I was finally just disappointed...is someone going bald in the kitchen and not wearing a hair net or hat?  The server was very kind and offered to take it off the bill or bring something else.  I was still a little hungry so I just ordered the warm banana churros that were recommended.  DELICIOUS.  Only problem is that my stomach was a bit upset after leaving.  So all in all....they need to keep up with the cleanliness.

REVISED REVIEW:  TRY THE KOREAN PORK SANDWICH....OMG...AMAZING!!  Pulled pork sandwich with a spicy cole slaw...enough said.  It's so freaking amazing and the bread it comes on is local and delicious.  The owner is very friendly and we have always made sure to go back and try other things.  They also have a really good caribbean beef sandwich too.  $7.50 for a sandwich tots and a pc of candy to end.  Its def worth it.

I am a big fan of sonoran dogs!  I like the ones from here because they put cabbage on the dogs.  The feel of the restaurant is cute...nothing special...you order, you sit down, eat, and get out!  It's pretty small but I'm sure it's a hot lunch spot for downtown.  I will definitely have to go back for the tacos and tequila next time I stop by.

I am absolutely in LOVE with the bacon wrapped jalapenos from here!  They have a cilantro lime cream on them (which wasn't what was on them last time I went...they said it had cayenne or something in it...not as good) and they tacos are great too.  They're not greasy..I'm usually not a big fan of tacos but these have rice and good meat on them.  The prices are reasonable and the staff is always so friendly.

When I went in, I was hoping that I had found my new go-to bike shop.  Small but in the neighborhood, Palmer seemed very knowledgeable and eager to help when I needed a bottom bracket for my bf's bike.  He said he was ordering it that day it should be there in a couple days, so I should bring my bike back that following thursday.  Great!  But when I went back on thursday, I went around 2pm and there was no one in the shop.  There was a sign on the door that he would be back in about 15min or less...I waited about 30...no one showed up.  I called later and he said they he hadn't received the part yet.  I asked him to call me when he received it...he asked me if he had me fill out anything when I came in earlier that week....nope.  So about three weeks went by (and we had already went to tempe bike since we hadn't heard back from him. ) he called me and said that he was really busy and has had the part in since he saw me walking my dog two weeks ago, but he just never called me.  Umm...yea that doesn't help me much.  If you're really looking to have a successful business in downtown phoenix, I suggest that you actually help the customers that are looking to start spending money with you.

I've been going to the office for about two years.  Every time I've gone in for my appointments...the service never stood out.  It was just another dr. appt to me.  When I went in for my annual wellness exam this past week, I overly impressed.  I had been seen my Mary F. the nurse practitioner and she was so thoughful and helpful in speaking to me about my overall health.  She not only talked to me about my "woman parts" but she also gave me a regimen for my acne which is always a touchy subject.  She also noticed a few skin conditions on my stomach that every other doctor or dermatologist ignored for the past year. It was more of a breath of fresh air that she noticed, listened, and payed attention, and that's what made my experience so positive.

As we are expecting our first child in September, we decided to start looking into infant care options early. We were excited to see Copper Sun (now a Bright Horizons Center) was downtown. Speaking with them on the phone initially was pleasant, so we scheduled a visit and actually came in a couple times, first time being just my husband, second time being the both of us. We were impressed and happy with the location so it seemed like a win.   When we were ready to register, we were told that there would be registration fee that needed to be paid along with the registration forms that we would need to submit. At the time, we were told there were two openings that would be available, so we went home to consider our options, then called back the next day to inform them that we would like to fill up one of those positions....well that next day, two openings ended up being one opening, but we were told by Andrea that we just had to bring in a check along with the forms for that position. When I called the next day to make sure that they would still be open by the time I was able to make it there after work, I was told by another staff member, Candace, that they hadn't even had any openings for the infant room for weeks.   Several weeks later, after we'd already decided that the disorganization of the center wasn't what we were looking for, we received an email from the Director of Customer experience, Heather, asking if we were ready to schedule our tour....  No thanks, if they can't operate their daycare center in an organized manner, I'm not sure that I trust them to care for my infant son.

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUDIO! The teachers are very welcoming and friendly, and the classes they offer are great. It definitely has a sense of community, but not the community where new people aren't welcome, but where new friends are encouraged, so don't be afraid to go by yourself. The studio is very clean and very although its an intense workout, the breathing and meditation that they teach you is very calming as well. I highly recommend this place.

Same exact experience as Whitney A.   Lady: "What you want"  Me: "Do you guys have time today to do a manicure pedicure?" (Its 4 pm, they close at 7)  Lady: "No"  Me: "Ok.....should I come back? When do you guys close?"  Lady: "We close at 7, the last one we'll do is 6"  Me: "Ok I'll come back later?"  Lady: "You can come back tomorrow"  Me: "No thanks" [throws up peace sign]  LOL a simple were booked for the rest of the day would have sufficed. It wasn't too bad when they first openend..but now, maybe they can't handle how busy they are? Eh, i'll just find something else.

I like Ruby Tuesday.  It's a chain yes, but I love their salad bar!  Usually when I go, I am by myself and the staff usually lets me keep to myself.  They don't bother me to the point of annoyance but they always check up on me.  All of the people are very friendly and as long as they keep the salad bar up and the staff happy, then I don't really see any problems.  (Except they've taken the crab cake burger and veggie burger off the the menu!  Those were my faves!)

Tastes so good it'll make you slap yo momma....ok never mind because my mom would round house kick me if I did that but damn.....this place is good. The bread was seriously awesome. The hubs had the biscuits and gravy and I had the forager breakfast sandwich. Would have liked to see more baked goods to stuff my hungry face with, but for the most part, we'll be back.

Disappointed :( visited the Union at the Biltmore and was completely drawn in by the beauty of macarons before me. So many flavors, so many colors to choose from. Since I'm the only one in the household that eats sweets I purchased 6, figuring that was more than enough.   I instagrammed the beautiful little European cookies that had accompanied me home. Then finally....it was time...time for me to enjoy these pillowy little desserts from heaven that I drove miles to discover, and to my absolute disappointment, they were terrible. The cookies were rock solid, every single one of them, and the filling, as stale as a stand up comedy act on amateur night.   Threw away 6 macarons, lost $10. RIP those poor cookies. [Pours beer onto the ground] This ones for my homies.   I'm only giving 2 stars because they were quite picture worthy.

I'm surprised this place hasn't taken off yet! Good price, great sushi, awesome staff. It's mostly awesome for the quick lunch. I just wish they had a website 1, but their hours will be better when they're open for dinner next week.

Wow, wow and wow. As I walked into this dope little spot that was jamming out to Jay-Z I just knew....it may be true love. I was greeted promptly and happily by Matteo, who was also my server. I sat at the little bar area and ordered a beer and hung out while browsing over the menu. I was going stag that night, and everyone was super friendly! Not in the manner of "wow this chick probably has no friends, what a loser" type fake friendly....but genuinely super cool, including the owner who was manning the oven.   It finally came time to order some food, so I decided to go with the Pizza Special, the Tricolore. It was perfect because I couldn't decide on just one pizza, and this pizza was split into three different sections. I added some anchovies to one part and wow. Took the first bite and wanted to punch someone in the face because of how good it was. The cheese, you could tell was fresh and made in house. The crust was the perfect amount of crispy and soft and all the ingredients were great. I also saved room for a cannoli and couldn't be happier with how good THAT was. Just the right amount of sweet, perfect crunch of the shell, none of the extra added BS like chocolate shit drizzled for no apparent reason.   I'll definitely be coming back and bringing more people. Thanks La Piazza.

I seriously love this place! We went to their free pizza night and not only was the people watching hilariously amazing, but the pizza was actually worth waiting for. You can make a custom pizza, or choose from their originals. The pizza is quick and tasty, and they ingredients are quality, yet under $10/person.

Fav new breakfast spot right in Coronado! Be prepared to wait for greatness, as you could possibly wait about an hour for food sometimes. The service is sometimes hit or miss and my orders haven't always been right but whatever.   The only big peeve I have is with the insane amount of flies on the patio and the lack of bussing and wiping, so it just makes it even worse. The 2nd best part of Duza's is the patio (#1 being the food obviously), please do something to make it more bearable!
