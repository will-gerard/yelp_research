I've never had a pupusa before, but it was an awesome thing to eat. A meat filled pancake? Yes, thank you! Well worth the fiasco of getting into the plaza with all the construction on Mesa Dr.

This was chinese food, which was a total surprise, since it is called a Thai Grill. I ordered kung pao chicken, which wasn't spicy at all and kind of bland. My wife had the lemon chicken which was pretty good, but not great. I was pretty disappointed that the only Thai food on the menu was pad thai. Oh well. It was worth a shot. The fellow who worked there was quite a character, and was fun.

These guys always give you the straight story about what's going on with your car. They stand by their work , meaning, if you're not satisfied they will fix it until you are. On two occasions they've gone back several times to fix something that was defective, probably costing themselves significantly in labor charges well above what I paid. But, they've earned my loyalty and business for life.

Great place to sit and chill with a nice beverage. The lamb sliders were wonderful,  and the braised beef rib was even better. The Spanish fritters left a little to be desired, but the lemon pound cake was excellent. Reasonable prices for excellent cuisine.
