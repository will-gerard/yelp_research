I love cheese. Really, who doesn't love cheese? Cream cheese, cheesecake, grilled cheese, string cheese, it's all pretty damn good. Cheuvront takes cheese to a whole new level.   My boyfriend and I took my out of town mom here before First Friday. It was understandably crowded, and the hostess at first gave us a 45 minute wait. Lucky for us, there were 3 empty seats at the bar. The service was quick for how busy it was and when we told the bartender to "surprise us" with the three-cheese plate...he did an amazing job. My absolute favorite was a brie called "Green Hill". It actually felt like I was eating dessert, it was so good.  While we were finishing the cheese plate, a table opened up and the hostess graciously let us know, and even held it open for us while we finished our appetizer and closed out at the bar, which I thought was really nice. For our dinners, Mom had the Niscoise salad (which I probably should have also done, considering I had just finished licking the cheese plate), I had the filet, and boyfriend got the scallops.  All were very good. The portions were on the small side, but we didn't leave hungry.  I haven't been back since,  but I remember looking at their happy hour tent card and thinking it's something we should try, though I can't remember the exact specials.  I'm sure it had something to do with cheese.  Another thing I appreciate about this place: They have multiple bathrooms, but they don't call one "Men's" and one "Women's".  I seriously feel like, as a people, we should stop this childish bathroom segregation. I understand large bathrooms with stalls being separate, but for a place with 2 one-person bathrooms to designate one for the "men" and one for the "women" is really dumb! It's not like you're in there with anyone else! All that happens is the Women's line gets long while the men shuffle in and out like there's a revolving door on the thing. Not fair!

Coda B. and I both crave Indian Lunch Buffets when we're hungover. Him more so than me. He's actually called me at 12:30 at night, from a bar, talking about how he wants Indian Food. It's as though he can already feel the hangover coming on and wants to make sure his priorities are in check. 1) Get home (or wherever) safely 2) Indian Food. I may have mixed up the order.  This Indian Delhi Palace is apparently under the same ownership as the Tempe location, but I like this one much better. For several reasons:  1) The Chicken Tikka Masala is AMAZING. Like, I've never had buffet food this good before. I don't really like Tandoori Chicken. Honestly, the color kind of freaks me out. I know it's from the sauce or whatever, but chicken, on the bone, with a kind of fluorescent pink glow is weird. I'll pass. But boneless chicken in a delightful red curry sauce? Don't mind if I DO!  2) This location has a much larger variety of dishes, especially vegetarian dishes, which are usually my favorite offerings at an Indian lunch buffet (see above about tandoori chicken freaking me out).  3) Um, hello? It looks like a freaking palace. These guys did not hold back and I freaking love them for it. I actually think more places offering a lunch buffet should treat its patrons like the hungover royalty that we are. I wouldn't mind if Souper Salad and Sweet Tomato hopped on this trend already. I mean, how hard can it be to add a few fancy door arches and some gold plated silverware? Not that hard really. Up your game, guys.  However, the only complaint I have about Indian Delhi Palace, and the primary reason why Flavors of India remains my favorite Indian Lunch Buffet has to do with the atmosphere. Yes, I appreciate the super sexy high-class water goblets, but Delhi Palace doesn't have any booths. And when I'm hungover, I need a freaking booth. I need my own little eating sofa. I need to be able to kick off my flip flops under the table and sprawl out like I'm enjoying their delicious naan on my own little loveseat. That's what I need, and that's what Flavors of India gives me. Oh, and some Bollywood wouldn't hurt either.

The only good thing about Applebee's is that it gives bad parents somewhere to take their bratty kids while still having a "night out" so they don't infiltrate places that I actually want to go. One star for that.  Two stars only if you stay in the bar and stick with beer and appetizers.

I like Oregano's.  I don't LOVE Oregano's but it's not their fault my Mother is from Staten Island and I therefore am genetically predisposed to prefer pizza I can fold.  Lance S. and I went here last night to binge before starting a 10 Day "Master Cleanse" fast today.  Something I never noticed before, but highly appreciate, is that their wines by the glass are VERY inexpensive.  Since I made the switch to wine as my exclusive drink of choice a couple years ago, my restaurant bills have pretty much doubled, but at Oregano's I can go drink for drink with Lance and his tall Bud Lights without being the asshole who added $30 to our bill in booze, so that's always good.  As I said before, I'm not crazy about their pizza, but their appetizers and salads are delicious, and they have a gigantic cookie on the menu so you can't really go wrong there.  I haven't tried the pasta either, but that's another type of food I have impossibly high standards for restaurants to meet, so I'm probably not the best critic.  Basically, Oregano's is a great place that everyone likes.  If you think you don't like Oregano's, there's something wrong with you. You should probably go to Oregano's, get a $5 glass of house white and some apps, and work that out.

This review is seriously overdue, though I figured I could hold off on writing it since with over 500 reviews averaging out to 4 stars it's clear Cherry Blossom doesn't need my blessing to keep serving up delicious noodles, pasta, sushi, and whatever the hell else they feel like putting on their menu to their many fans.    I guess we'll start with the food, though that's not really why I'm writing this review. My go-to order is TanTan-Men which is actually kind of a problem considering I love it so much I rarely venture out from it and I'm sure there are other noodle dishes that are just as delicious that I am missing out on (feel bad for me). But, if you like spice, the TanTan-Men is the way to go. It will fill your stomach and clear your sinuses, and the order is HUGE. Definitely a two, or maybe even three, sitting meal. Which reminds me, once after dining in and barely denting my ginormous soup order, I proceeded to have a minor panic attack about how I was going to get this ramen equivalent of hoover dam into a to-go container without spilling it all over myself and causing a major scene. This panic attack proved to be completely unwarranted, since as soon as I said I wanted to take the rest home they took it and neatly packaged it FOR ME which was very nice and appreciated (I'm seriously not sure what I would have done if they brought me a container...cried, possibly).   This is the kind of service I'm writing this review about. Let me explain:  Every year since I've known him, my boyfriend hibernates from approximately January to June to study for an extremely difficult exam called the "CFA".  It's like the Bar except it's harder, it's about finance, and you have to take (and pass) a newer and harder level every year for three years to finally become a "CFA". This year the test was in June and of course, as soon as he was done with it we wanted to do something we hadn't been able to do for quite a while: a good old fashioned bar crawl.  This bar crawl went pretty long and at one point I remember playing the always appropriate song "Stay Fly" by Academy Award winning rap group Three Six Mafia on a jukebox at some dive bar whose name I can't even recall right now. Fast forward 24 hours later, and I can't find my wallet. I just KNEW I lost it on the bar crawl, and highly suspected it was during aforementioned jukebox session. I called every bar we visited to no avail and finally just came to terms with the fact that my cherry red Kate Spade wallet that I loved was gone forever. I bought a new wallet, got a new ID, new credit cards, all that fun stuff, and went on with my life.  Fast forward a couple months later. There's a package at my door. It's from Cherry Blossom Noodle Café. "Hmm...I don't remember ordering takeout from Cherry Blossom Noodle Café," I think, "and if I did, sending it UPS is a very odd method of delivery".  Then it dawned on me...what's my hangover food of choice after a good old fashioned bar crawl that ends with me playing inappropriate songs by Academy Award winning rap groups at bars whose name I can't recall? OMG NOODLES!!!!  Oh yes, I went to Cherry Blossom the next day for a hangover lunch, left my wallet there, and proceeded to completely block out the entire trip while trying to remember what bar I could have possibly left my wallet at the night before.  They got my address from my ID, packaged it up, paid the shipping, and MAILED IT TO ME. It was seriously one of the happiest days of my life. Any place that will go that much out of their way (Mind you, I never even CALLED them about the wallet. They had nothing to go on here.) to help a customer will never get less than 5 stars in my book though it doesn't hurt that their food is delicious, cures hangover, and packs itself up to go without you making a scene. Thank you, Cherry Blossom!

I'm going to do something I've never done before with this review. I'm going to actually review while eating the food for the very first time. That's right, I just got home from Scott's Generation after waking up on a girlfriend's couch with a brutal hangover and a huge craving for matzo ball soup and chopped liver. I picked up a to-go order, and they're sitting in front of me right now, eagerly awaiting my noshing session.  Right now, Scott's Generation is happily sitting at 5 stars. The employee handling my to-go order was awesome and seemed amused at my hangover remedy. Despite the fact that I love challah like a brother and could eat chopped liver for breakfast lunch and dinner, my parents insist I am not of Jewish heritage. However, there's never been an official paternity test, so I'm still holding out hope. On to the food!  The soup is fantastic! Lots of chunky veggies and chicken in a very tasty broth. The matzo balls are large with good texture. I would prefer a bit more seasoning, but I won't deduct a star because for all I know I'm just an Italian schmuck who doesn't know what a true matzo ball should taste like. But yeah, seasoning is good.  Opening my bagel chips and...wtf? Is that a cinnamon raisin bagel chip! Sorry, deducting a star. Bagel chips are for soups and spreads. I don't care who you are, nobody wants a raisin in their soup. Throw them out!  Eating the chopped liver and....giving the star back! It's delicious and I haven't even mixed in any onion!  I don't think I realized how dense a half pound of chopped liver would be, I kind of wish I would have got some rye for a sandwich. Sorry, internal monologue creeping into review, I'll stop that now.  Five stars for my first ever present-tense review! I can't wait to go back to Scott's to try the rest of their (very large) menu! Though for this trip, I'm glad I got out when I did. I was half drunk and the rainbow cookies were calling my name. I'll sober up first next time.

This place was, in a word, AWESOME. For those who don't know, one of my favorite places in THE WORLD is Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse in Manhattan.  This place actually reminds me a LOT of that place, which is great to have right in my neighborhood (not to mention right next to my favorite strip club, but that's another review).  Came here with a group of ladies on Saturday night, and we had so much fun. I mean, how many items need to be delivered to your table ON FIRE before you start having a good time?  Hint: It doesn't take many. However, our mid-twenties asses were put to shame by the biggest party animal of the night, 90 Year old Mildred. This chick was celebrating her birthday with 75 of her closest friends and was scooting around that place with a vengeance. It was incredible. According to the wonderful owners we chatted with, she E-VITED her guests.  Yes, a 90 year old woman learned how to E-VITE specifically to invite 75 friends to Bacchanal.  That may not be entirely accurate, but I wouldn't doubt it.  I had the Veal Bacchanal, Aimee H. had the lamb skewer, and our two friends had the Greek Lasagna and the Lamb Shank.  My veal was very good, but the Lamb Shank that I tried was incredible! Like fall off the bone tender. But it was huge, and I was filling up on wine and ouzo, so I was satisfied with my bites.  Really though, the experience itself is worth five stars. Yes, the food isn't inexpensive (around $15-$20 for an entree...but they have a gyro plate for $10 as well), but they could have charged $5 at the door for the entertainment alone. Belly dancers, a live band, freaking throwing plates on the ground! Obviously, the way to any girl's heart is condoned destruction of property, so they did a great job recognizing that.  Okay this is a long review, but go when they have the belly dancers and band, get the lamb and some ouzo shots, and throw some plates on the ground. If you don't have a good time, you should maybe re-evaluate your definition of "good time". That is all.

I seriously cannot think of a reason to deduct a star from Texaz. It's about as authentic as you can get without going back in time.  The food is consistent and delicious. I'm a purist so I used to order the chicken fried steak but have since broadened my horizons and have started ordering the chicken fried chicken which is, in my opinion, better. I also really appreciate the fact that they started offering half orders because their regular portion sizes are ginormous (though the leftovers are also delicious).   This is probably one of my more boring reviews because I don't have anything to snark about with Texaz.  I actually joined their email list just because they seem like nice people and I'd like to hear from them more often.  Their food also cures all hangovers and it is the absolute perfect place to go on Sunday night after a long weekend of liver damage in Vegas (learned this last weekend). Five Stars.

I dig the Duck.  I don't even really know what to call it.  Part store, part bar, part deli, part someone's living room who doesn't make you feel guilty about not helping with the dishes, only catch being you actually have to pay for your wine and cheese (which I'm totally fine with if it means I don't feel guilty for not helping with the dishes).  Basically the duck has everything you could possibly need dispersed at different locations around what appears to be a large cabin with a lush green park in front.  You get your items (wine, coffee, sandwiches, whatever) and you mosey around, find a place to sit and enjoy them, just like you would in your own backyard, except your own backyard probably doesn't have as extensive of a wine collection or an award winning cheese department (and if it does, I officially hate you).  I like to come here for happy hour (M-F, til 7:00, $2 off house wine and draft beer) or on Sunday afternoons to do a little daydrinking and people watching.  I don't have kids or a dog, but people that do seem to love this place.  Normally I don't prefer my wine with children (probably why I don't have kids), but the Duck's overall mellow environment somehow soothes me to the point that I find myself actually enjoying the presence of the mini-humans. And if I enjoy anywhere enough to actually consider motherhood, it's probably worth at least a dozen or so stars, but Yelp only goes up to five so five it is.

Coda B. and I don't go out for pizza very often. This is for 2 reasons. 1. Coda likes Domino's. 2. I like, nay, LOVE mushrooms on pizza (among other delicious vegetable toppings) while Coda prefers his pizza be served with toppings that, at one point, had a face. I'm not a vegetarian by any means (see my review of Blue Nile for proof), I just strongly prefer veggies on my pizza. I feel the tastes compliment each other better, and it's also much prettier. Neither of us is a big fan of compromise, so splitting a pizza is usually a challenge.   NYPD took the pain out of pizza for us. We ordered a 14" 5-topping and our AMAZING server let us know that, if we so desired, we could do 5 toppings on one half and 5 DIFFERENT toppings on the other, at no additional charge. I wanted to kiss her feet. I don't think she realized how far we would take it though, as our respective halves did not share one topping. That's right, we don't mess around. At this point in the meal, my Yelp rating of NYPD was 5 stars. Of course, I still had to eat the pizza.     It is utterly confusing to me how so many places can claim to serve "New York" pizza and fail miserably, while almost every pizza place actually located in New York manages to pull it off. It's as if something magical happens when pizza is prepared in a new york zip code, and it's nearly impossible to recreate. But people keep trying. NYPD did not successfully recreate New York pizza. However, for Arizona pizza NYPD is definitely up there. And no, I've never waited 4 hours for pizza.  Four stars for the food and cute, albeit somewhat gimmicky, ambiance. Five stars for the service. Our server was incredible, and they even gave us a gift bag when we left! It had coupons and a magnet! I used to order from a Chinese delivery place solely because they gave you little trinkets with your order, and I do order happy meals every so often so yeah, I guess you can say I'm a fan of gifts with food. So thanks for the magnet, New York Pizza Department. I will be back.

Honestly, I'm only writing this review because I just made a list titled "Places I Get Crizzunk" and Merc Bar absolutely has to be on it. Because, well, I do. I'm not sure what it is about the place... I think because they don't really serve food here so just by showing up you're basically letting everyone know that you're there to party. Or maybe because the music is a little too loud to have a conversation, but it's not really a dancing place either. Or because it's all inside so you can't smoke and drink. Whatever the reason, Merc nights usually result in an extremely bad hangover for me the next morning. But I never learn my lesson and tend to end up there at least once a month.  Last time, someone who was equally crizzunk started a Conga line when "Jump in The Line" came on...I jumped on (of course)...I mean, c'mon, who wouldn't want to do a Conga line to that song? But apparently the Merc crowd is too cool for school and weren't having it.  I know it's supposed to be swanky and classy, but really it's just a close place to my house that I drink at. Sorry in advance if I ruin your ambiance, but I always have an extremely good time here.

I used to work for the owner when he was GM of another bar so I'm a little biased but I had a great time here and have been meaning to go back ever since. The draft beer selection isn't great but the prices more than make up for it.  Plus, Hockey easily triumphs all other sports when it comes to being the most entertaining to watch while getting drunk, in my opinion. I mean, cmon, baseball? If I wanted to watch a bunch of roided up dudes standing around doing nothing I would just drink in Scottsdale. Ice Hockey [sign for greater than that for some reason Yelp doesn't allow] Scottsdale.  Clearly

Ya know, just when I thought I couldn't fit one more restaurant into my casual Mexican food rotation, Rubio's comes along with its damn delicious tacos and its friendly employees and its integration of Coke Zero in its fountain drink machine and the next thing you know I'm up to FOUR very viable options for my (frequent) inexpensive taco/burrito cravings.  Chipotle obviously has the burrito game on lock. I just won't order one anywhere else, it won't measure up.  El Pollo Loco's grilled chicken is phenomenal, as are their salsas, and Sonora Mesquite Grill has the most amazing Carne Asada I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth, so I'm covered there also. Now, you may be thinking to yourself "This girl really has it figured it. What void in her life could Rubio's possible fill that she has to add it to an already stellar line up of very well thought out and eloquently presented Mexican casual dining options?"  To that I say: Fish Tacos.  I'm not saying that Rubio's has the best Fish Tacos in the world. I may be an expert on a lot of things, but sadly Fish Tacos isn't one of them. But Rubios' are good, and their tomatillo salsa is tasty and, as previously mentioned, they carry Coke Zero which is just so ridiculously head and shoulders above Diet Coke I'm surprised its market hasn't been completely cannibalized by now. I guess some people just enjoy barely-carbonated cola beverages that have the aftertaste of battery acid. But I digress.  I'm going to let you guys in on a little secret: Chicken Balsamic and Roasted Veggie Salad.  Grilled chicken (not El Pollo Loco quality, but it's fair), avocado, and roasted veggies over lettuce with a tangy balsamic dressing. A good portion as long as you're not famished, and really quite tasty. Here's the secret: 310 Calories. For the whole thing, none of that "without dressing, avocado, chicken, or anything that tastes good" bull (I'm looking at you Subway).  I like to dip the chicken in tomatillo salsa, which might add like 5 calories to the deal, but I'm okay with it because I'm still saving about 400 calories which can now be put towards a more noble purpose: Booze! So, Rubio's, take a seat in the line up. If for the sake of the booze and the booze alone, you've earned it.

The best Chipotle is located on Detroit Road in Lakewood, OH. Sorry, I know it's a drive, but it's the truth. However, right now this is the closest Chipotle to my place so I'll review it. But this review is for Chipotle as a chain, not this particular location. If I were to review a specific location, I would review the one in Lakewood, OH because it is the best one.  Chipotle is really really good. I love the burrito assembly line. I love that they aren't stingy with...anything. At least with me they aren't. I think they may pick up on the subtle "BITCH I WILL CUT YOU" look in my eye if they even hint at putting the spoon down after only one scoop of chicken.  Either way, it's awesome.  It's in that weird "fast food atmosphere without fast food pricing" quadrant of the restaurant world, which I normally don't like but with Chipotle it's acceptable because you are getting a burrito the size of a baby for about $7.    Woulda given it 5 stars, but the one in Lakewood, OH is better.

We wandered in here after walking back to the Zipp's parking lot for vehicle retrieval. I got a delicious peach iced tea that I didn't want to end. However, I just walked half a mile in 100 degree weather, so it had to.  They have adorable little treats for only $.60 each (or 3 for $1.50). The chocolate covered macaroon was by far the best. Much like the elusive "Bon Bon" I feel like I've heard a lot about Macaroons in my life, while never actually tasting one, so I'm glad that changed with Mama Java.  Also, they have a toy sushi set that I really enjoyed. It was among the books. Next to the Mr. Potato Head. I think it was for children, but I'm easily amused so I had a fun time with it.  The only thing I would change is the $.50 surcharge for credit card transactions. But their macaroons are only $.60. I could probably scrounge up that kinda coin from my car any given day, so I'm not too worried about it.

I've been to Postino a few times, but as we all know it is a violation of Yelp TOS to review an establishment until you've been drunk there. What? It's not? Well, I would consider it in poor taste.  I got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know.   All of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as "Cinnamon Toast Crunch", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them.   To top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it. The staff literally organized an impromptu search party for a dog that could run upwards of 60 MPH. That is some damn good service. And, we found the dog.

This place doesn't even unlock their front door, that is how awesome they are.  It doesn't even have a freaking name according to the average passerby, because I'm pretty sure a neon sign that says "Cocktails" is all the "Branding" they need.  It's the size of a living room and reminds me of my grandparents basement, with at least twice as many drunk senior citizens. Their prices are straight out of 1986. They have a freaking pinball machine. Their jukebox makes my drunken ass scream "OhmygodthisismyFFAAAAVVVVOOORRRITTTEEsong" like 12 times a night. They have pool, darts, and Megatouch. It's like I died and went to drunk amusement heaven.  You know what else they have? Booze. And Beer. And more booze, and more beer, and lots of people who dig drinking lots of booze and beer and don't give a shit about seeing or being seen.  They only thing people go to Great Escape to see is the bottom of a rocks glass, and you won't even see that very often because the bartenders are on top of their shit every single time I've been.  If they got shuffle board, I would bump them up to 5 stars. Until then, I still love them for everything they aren't.

Love this place.  The  red coconut curry sauce is awesome, and their hot is HOT. Normally, if there's an "mild, medium, hot" option, i go with hot and still end up asking for tabasco or siracha or whatever.  Not this place.  I've actually started ordering medium.  I've never had an issue with the service.  Sometimes they take a while to take your order but as long as the food comes out hot (which their's always does!), I'm a happy girl.  I try to get a different appetizer every time and they've all been great.  The only thing I wish they would start doing (besides getting a soda fountain) is offering individual soup sizes.  Yeah, those bowls with the fire in the middle are cool looking, but I can never get soup here because my boyfriend thinks Hot and Sour tastes like a foot! Now that i think about it, I bet if I asked they would work something out for me, but the rest of the menu looks so good I've never been short of options.    Just to reiterate what i said in the beginning: Red...Coconut...Curry.   I don't remember the number. Chicken or Shrimp are both good. You won't be sorry.

Okay, still a solid 4 stars, but I have to update to make sure everyone is aware that if there was a soup good enough to warrant putting up with the beratings of a moody Saddam Hussein doppelganger a la Seinfeld, it would be the #15 soup at Thai Lahna.  It's absolutely incredible.  Mouthgasm in every spoonful.  I don't even want to know what's in it because it definitely tastes like "butter" is one of the top 3 ingredients, which makes it awesome for my mouth but not so awesome for my ass. But it's totally worth it.

I really needed a cigarette at the Vig the other night and they were closed at 11:30 PM on a Saturday night. I'm deducting a star and holding it hostage until the next time I need something and Empire is actually open for me to get it.

A few general truths I should make everyone aware of before I write my GLOWING review of this establishment:  1) I regularly wear clothes 2) I regularly drink red wine (almost as regularly as I wear clothes) 3) Clothes + red wine + effects of said red wine = This is why I can't have nice things.  However, Park Avenue is actually in the process of allowing me to defy human logic and somehow cross item #3 off of the list of "General Truths about Georgeann's Life" because I swear to god they can clean ANYTHING out of ANYTHING.  And for $2.25!  Just be warned, for some of the tougher stains (which I have many) you will get it back with one of those little signs that says they couldn't get the stain out without damaging the fabric. A lot of my garments come back with this tag, but like I said, I can't have nice things. However, most of the time I see the tag but for the life of me can't find the stain so I don't really care. However, if the piece was expensive or important to me, or if the stain is really noticeable and I am really sad about it, you can always ask them to give it special care and they will blow your mind.  Two examples: I had a brand new Kensie dress that I absolutely LOVED and brought to Vegas with me almost immediately after buying. Like most of us on our way to vegas, it got completely smashed and was a wrinkled mess when I pulled it out of my suitcase. Like an idiot, I tried to steam iron this rayon dress, despite the facts that rayon does not take well to moisture and I do not know how to iron. What resulted was water stains all over this brand spanking new dress, and me having to improvise an entire Vegas ensemble.  When I brought it in to Park Ave I asked them to please try and remove the stains WITHOUT removing the tags, thinking I might be able to get away with returning it if they really couldn't get the stains out. They got every one of them out, and I'm presuming by hand because I'm pretty sure putting it through the dry clean process would have melted the tags right off. I was SO impressed and asked what I owed for the stain removal. Clearly it could not be the same $2.25 I pay for washable blouses just because they come out all nice and pressed and I don't know how to iron. But it was! I insisted I should pay more, and they insisted that I shouldn't.   Most recently I, ingeniously, decided to wear a white maxi skirt on the fourth of July. You know, that day where everyone gets extremely inebriated in the name of Personal Freedom? Also, that day it was forecasted to rain the whole time? Yes, mud plus a white, floor-length skirt sounded like a good idea to me (this is why I can't have nice things). Of course, like most us on the Fourth of July, the bottom got absolutely trashed and I was not surprised to see the dreaded "Sorry We Tried :(" tag hanging when I went to pick it up. I took the plastic off right in the dry cleaners to somberly assess the damage and the girl behind the counter asked if I wanted to send it through again and see what they can do. Why, yes! Thank you for asking! On the second try the skirt came back completely pristine! Again at no extra charge. I am honestly hesitating on posting this review right now because I don't want this place to get too crowded, but they deserve every piece of business they get. GIVE THEM ALL THE STARS!!!

Hi, my name is Georgeann and I'm an iPhone addict. I twitter, I foursquare, I tumbl, I angry bird, I words with friends, I basically have every single addiction you can possible have contained in that little device. If there was an app for "Smoking Crack", I'd probably pick that habit up too.  But, as much as I love it, I can also be pretty irresponsible with taking care of my beloved little phone treasure. I never fully charge it, drop it constantly, and once spilled an entire pint of Newcastle INTO my purse, soaking my phone AND wasting a beer. That was a sad night. Another thing I pretty much consistently do is leave my phone random places, such as bars, cabs, bathrooms, and now, Sky Harbor Airport Parking Shuttles.   Luckily, the people at Sky Harbor Airport Parking are awesome and I was able to recover my phone as soon as I realized it was missing, which any iPhone addict knows would take them six and a half minutes, tops.  I flipped a bitch, passing my driver on the way, he gave me the thumbs up and I knew my precious was waiting safely for me in their front booth.  And it was!  Any place that helps with the recovery of my phone deserves 5 stars (see my update of The Vig for proof), but this company would have probably received 5 for me, or at least a rounded-up 4.5, regardless.  They're easy to find (just past the railroad tracks on 40th street), always have room on the lot, and quickly pick you up both from your car and from the airport. I've never had to call them after landing, it's never even occurred to me, and I think I've waited for a maximum of 10 minutes. The drivers are really friendly, and the prices are the best I've seen, especially if you download the coupon from their website that gets you $6.50/day uncovered. For a weekend trip, that's cheaper than a cab and way less awkward than being that annoying friend who is always asking for rides to the airport. Plus, if you're a huge flake like me who can't keep her belongings on her person for more than 6 hours at a time, there's a good chance you'll get your stuff back. Five stars!

Okay so before everyone gets all JUDGEY about the impossibly high rating I gave a sushi restaurant in Arizona that's part of a chain owned by Benihana (THE HORROR!), hear me out.  My office is located in the Kierland Commons. This can be nice when I want to blow half my paycheck at H&M during my lunch break, but it's not so nice when I NEED to blow half my paycheck if I want to be able to go somewhere walking distance from my office for lunch. Originally, I thought my most reasonable options were a $7 Asian Chicken Salad at Chloe's Corner or crossing Scottsdale Rd to get to Chipotle. That is, until I ventured over to RA today and saw what I had been missing.  For starters, they have some amazing lunch specials.  Yes, they are pricier than Chipotle but in the grand scheme of sushi, they're pretty damn good. They have a Sashimi Lunch combo that is four pieces of salmon, tuna, and yellowtail with a miso soup and a salad for like $12.  Their Bento lunches come with so many things I can't even remember them all and cost like $9.  For the area (this mall in particular), these lunch prices are incredibly reasonable.  What I got today, the Tuna Squared Salad, isn't even on the lunch menu and it totally blew my mind that for a couple bucks more than the tuna-mayo salad over greens I get at Chloe's (which is delicious BTW but that's not the point), I could be getting a huge portion of greens topped with about 5-6 pieces of seared ahi, about 5-6 slices seared sushi-grade albacore, avocado, and cashews.  These are all very expensive things!  This should be a very expensive salad! But it's $10 and it's glorious.  Oh one more thing that I probably won't be getting while we're in the triple digits but I have had before and it's delightful: Miso Hot Soup.  Picture a huge miso soup full of shrimp and tofu and mushrooms with with a kick strong enough to clear your sinuses.  Plus it comes with these fried rice balls (I usually get it to go and they come on the side) that are surprisingly delicious. I always think I can save some calories and not eat them, but it never happens. Those suckers are in the soup by the second spoonful and gone before I'm half done, they're just that good.  All in all, no, I don't go to RA for mind-blowingly fresh, melt-in-your-mouth sushi. But I do go for decent lunch options at prices that allow me to blow money during my lunch break the way God intended: Shopping.

Thank god it's closed. My boyfriend once caught a guy trying to reach into my purse while I was making my way through the crowd. Another guy then straight up asked him if he knew where he could get blow, as he was from out of town and just ran out. That was our first and last visit.

Honestly, if I were to have paid for this room I might have only given it 4 stars.  But, I happen to have a friend who travels to resorts around the country for work, and when he told me he would be staying at the Phoenician and invited me to be his guest for the weekend, I was pretty much all about it.  He worked about 12 hours a day while I lounged around the pool, took bubble baths in the huge hotel bathroom, and drank wine in bed while waiting for him to get off so I could show him around Scottsdale.  It was like "Pretty Woman" except instead of sexual favors, I paid for my stay with extensive local knowledge and amusing witty banter.  We were in the main building, where the rooms are very decently sized, and the bathrooms are pretty damn huge.  The grounds are gorgeous, and the close-but-not-too-close to Old Town Scottsdale location makes it ideal for having a night out without worrying about a $40 cab ride to get back to your secluded resort hotel.   There were a couple things I would change about the room. For one thing, I wasn't a huge fan of the beds. For what I imagine would normally be a $250+/night stay, I've had better.  It was a nice bed, for sure, but not as opulently luxurious as an Arizona Biltmore or Royal Palms, in my opinion. Also, the bathroom had a lighted magnifying cosmetic mirror, which is awesome, but it protruded from the wall at exactly 5'5" from the ground, and wasn't adjustable. So, it would be perfect for A. 5'5" women and B. Pete Wentz. But if you're 5'2" like me, it was pretty useless.  The pool was actually really relaxing. No DJ and drunk partiers were at a minimum as well. I also appreciate that they bring out pitchers of water to everyone without the stupid "bottle or tap" question (which obviously comes with the obligatory eye roll when you're fine with not paying $12 for something that comes out of a toilet for free) . The service was a little spotty.  We called it "leisurely" but some might call it slow. Plus, somehow my card got charged twice, once for my real amount and once for a completely different amount, which probably means the server accidentally ran my card for somebody else's tab, so hopefully that falls off my bank account before posting. At $7/beer, I can't really afford to pay for anyone's drinks but my own.  All in all, I would give it 4.5 stars, but I had a great weekend with great company and the fact that I didn't have to go the Vivian Ward route to get it (though I still got the bubble bath) made it even better, so I'm rounding up to 5.

This is my first review and I had to write it about what is probably my favorite place EVER. I had my freaking graduation party here. With my family, 80 year old Grandma included. And she even liked it. The beer is just awesome. If me and my boyfriend can agree, it's great to split a $11 pitcher during happy hour (I know..the prices just went up but still not bad).  I love all the appetizers with the exception of the beer bread things.  They're just weird and too hard to eat.  The jalepeno popper burger is so yummy. Cream cheese on a burger is such a good idea and the crispy onion strings add nice texture. Another plus is that it's not wimpy like most "Spicy" items. It's actually pretty spicy. I also LOVE their nightly specials. I've seen Filet Mignon, Buffalo, and Osso Bucco on those things! It's always a great surprise, and always delicious.  The service is great, everyone is very friendly and the atmosphere is awesome. Sometimes the music is too loud to have a conversation inside so I'm a consistent patio diner. It's right by my house and I really like trying new places and cuisine so I'm always thinking of somewhere new to go, but it's great just to have an old standby that's consistently a good time.

I don't know good sushi. I like happy hour. I like Sake Bombers. I am fully aware that I live in a desert and sushi would be so much better if I lived by a body of water.   That being said, I've never had a bad experience at Sushi 101 and I've been here a LOT.  I used to work at a sushi bar with an absolutely insane owner. Contrary to the norm, sushi is the one food that you actually crave more of when you spend more time around it. When I worked at a bagel place, I didn't want to look at a bagel for years afterward. When I was working at this sushi place, I became some kind of sushi fiend. I wanted it ALL THE TIME.    However, as previously noted, the owner was a crazy person. He fired me twice, only to call hours later asking why I wasn't at work because it was getting busy. He constantly yelled at employees and accused everyone of stealing. We had the turnover of a Whitechapel whorehouse. Needless to say, this did not lead to me wanting to be at my job more often than absolutely necessary to pay my bills (and feed my new found sushi addiction).  So, I would go to work, make money, crave sushi, and then head to Sushi 101 for my fix.  As I've mentioned several times, I have no shame in my love for happy hour. If a restaurant has happy hour every day of the week, it would have to suck pretty hard for me to give it any lower than 4 stars. Sushi 101 has great happy hour specials on drinks, apps, rolls, and nigiri 7 days a week. Coda B. and I can usually have an all-out feast here for less than $50 (and we can put down some sushi).  The food is always good. Even though I don't know what good sushi is. It's all good to me, which means it must really all be bad, and I'm just not cool enough to have had the actual good sushi. Though I have had sushi in New York and LA and San Diego and at several very nice restaurants elsewhere. That was good too. But I'm not one to turn my nose up at salmon nigiri just because it only cost $2.50 and I ate it in a desert. BTW, their salmon nigiri is really really good. We almost always have to order more. And it's $2.50 and you don't have to drive to an ocean to get it. Which makes it even better.  The staff is full of ASU students, which should be expected given the location. They can get overwhelmed, but I'm a real easy customer when it comes to sushi so I've never had a problem with it. Those 22 oz beers keep me occupied for a while. The owner doesn't appear to verbally berate and/or fire-bomb (I made up that word, it's where you fire someone out of nowhere, preferably mid-shift) employees for no reason, so that's definitely a plus in my book as well.  Go during happy hour. It's a great value for good times and good sushi (even though I don't know what good sushi is).

Sweet Baby Jesus I love this place.  Little backstory: I like my meat as rare as humanly possible. When I order a burger Medium Rare at a restaurant and they tell me they don't do that (which has happened to me at LEAST twice) I literally want to stab someone. Blue Nile will actually serve me RAW meat. It's called Kitfo and it's amazing. It's spicy and juicy and rich and indulgent and would probably shave about 10 years off of my life if I treated myself to it more than once every 6 months or so. It's like eating steak tartar as your dinner, with a side of two amazing veggies (I always get Collared Greens and Mushrooms and they are both awesome).  I've never ordered anything else, but my boyfriend mixes it up a bit and he's never been disappointed.  Last time he got the meat lovers, which was a platter of beef, lamb, shrimp, and chicken, with one veggie side of the collared greens.  I tried everything and of course it was all delicious and surprisingly dissimilar to one another, which to me seems tricky when you're dealing with a lot of curry and spicy based sauces. Just a side note (which actually makes this place even more awesome despite the slight inconvenience it was to our last visit): This place doesn't serve beer and wine anymore. BUT (and it's a good "BUT")...it is now BYOB!  For just a $5 corking charge! Love, love, LOVE Blue Nile.

I've come to Rula Bula A LOT in my 10 years of living in arizona. I remember taking my parents here as an ASU undergrad, taking dates here as a twenty something single person, and apparently still coming back today. I've always loved the food and drinks.   But for some reason, the place has never really struck a cord enough to review but I now want to only because I absolutely loved the band that was here. The audio was perfect and they actually made the night a lot better, which is unusual for a cover band. I'm not just saying this because I got a free CD. Rula Bula consistently delivers

This is what happens when I go to Haji Baba: They give me a huge Gyro with TONS of delicious meat and HUGE chunks of feta cheese, a side of hummus, warm pita bread, AND a dolmade, I give them $6.  I really feel like I'm ripping them off, but it's not like intentionally stealing from them, I'm just paying what they want me to. And god I love them for it.  The atmosphere is... are you seriously concerned with the atmosphere at a freaking gyro place? Did you not read the part about delicious gyro meat and huge chunks of feta cheese? Well, it's slightly more upscale than a cart in the middle of the sidewalk. By "upscale" i mean indoors.  Sometimes they have tables and chairs for you to sit on, sometimes they put the chairs on top of the table so you don't. Sometimes they have servers to take your order, sometimes you have to order from the counter. It's all a crap shoot. What's not a crap shoot is that you are getting a heaven in a pita for less than $5. Freaking incredible.

My previous review still stands, though now I'm pretty much all about the Chicken Schwarma "Sandwich". I even got scolded once for calling it a "Chicken Schwarma Gyro". Since I'm all for delicious, cheap food with a side of cultural sensitivity lessons, 5 stars!

I cure hangovers by eating oysters and drinking bloody marys on the patio at Casey Moore's.  I don't know what it is about that combo...the sunshine? Possibly. The juicy shellfish? Maybe. The double shot of vodka mixed in a spicy tomato juice concoction? Probably. Best breakfast ever.

Let me preface my 4-star rating with: I did NOT pay the full price of $145+/Night for my stay here.  In fact, when I stay at local hotels in Scottsdale, I ALWAYS Hotwire it and end up spending about $50/Night on average. Because of this, my reviews tend to lean towards a more generous star rating than they may actually deserve if we were paying full price.  That being said, I think Mondrian gets a bad rap because it's easy to hate on. Yeah, the butt lamps are tacky, the rooms are small and have what look like boobie tassels hanging from the counter, and wtf is with the sheep thing?  But honestly, the service was great from start to finish (with the exception of a slightly bitchy pool bartender), the drinks were strong, and I really didn't get a pretentious Scottsdale vibe from any of the other guests. The pool had enough plastic around it to float a small village but really who doesn't like a good pair of fake boobies for your Saturday afternoon enjoyment? I know I do.  We checked in early (around noon, when our room wasn't guaranteed until 4) and it was kind of a late birthday party for me so since I knew their pool was opened to the public I invited some friends to visit. They met me in the lobby and I asked the front desk person about the pool policy. He said there is a cover if you're not a room guest but slipped me 3 extra "guest passes" so my friends wouldn't have to pay! To top it off, our room was ready immediately! AKA they didn't look at the rate I paid before deciding to make me wait until the very last possible second before letting me into my hotel room (a la Valley Ho).  The valet guys didn't turn up their noses when we said we'd rather self park, they just gave us directions as to how to park the closest to our room. When we checked out, everyone asked how our stay was and the same front guest guy invited me back to pool for round two. Unfortunately I was way too hungover (see aforementioned point about strong drinks) but it was tempting.  All-in-all I had a good time, and I don't consider myself a douche. Though, after reading this review, you might disagree.

"I'm so glad we went there. That was THE best time I've ever had at a strip club in Vegas." - My date. Two days later.   But this isn't a review about how awesome I am to go to strip clubs with.  The Rhino was definitely fun, though.  We went during March Madness so it was PACKED and we luckily were able to snag one of the last tables in the place. Despite their obvious crowd of testosterone fueled NCAA fans, the girls still came around to our table of two couples VERY often and were super friendly and cute. I shared a bond with them because apparently my legs were stripper-smooth. I guess strippers have the monopoly on super smooth legs and when they find a girl that cracked their code it's like we're all in some kind of secret society together, which I obviously will take as a compliment.  I can't say anything for how much anything cost (as it should be when it comes to women going to strip clubs), but the fact that my date paid for everything and then said it was the best time he'd ever had makes me feel like it was fair. I will say that if you come here, bottle service is probably worth it. I can't imagine having as good of a time without a table and the way drinks are priced everywhere in Vegas, bottles usually don't end up being much more than what you'd pay to drink all night anyway.  All in all, I had a great time, he had a great time, you'll probably have a great time. Oh, and ladies, use a Mach 3. That Venus shit is for amateurs.

I've been to Fez three times in the past 2 weeks. That's normally a frequency I reserve for the Vig, but I'm glad I did because I've now had a burger, a salad, and brunch, which means I can give a very well rounded review.  That well rounded review is: EVERYTHING EFFING ROCKS.  Seriously, the sweet potato fries. Are you kidding me with those damn sweet potato fries? Extraordinary. I cheers them with people sometimes. It's really lame. I apologize to everyone I've done that too, I just feel they need to be revered.  The Brunch? Um $3 morning beverages and the Fez Omelette that's so full of goat cheese there is literally not ONE bite without it?   NOT ONE BITE.  Outstanding.  The little half versions of their salads is more than enough for me, and at $7 they are a great value, considering the good shit to lettuce ratio. They go very heavy on the good shit (you know, the stuff that actually has a taste).  I can see how everyone loves the Fez burger too. To be honest, I'm not a huge BBQ fan so the flavor isn't really for me, but if you are I'm sure it would be pure deliciousness.  The service is always amazing, with impeccable timing and great knowledge of the product. It's like they've actually tried everything on the menu. Shocking, I know.  I guess in order to really round out my review I should try a soup and a dessert. I'll have to just make a huge sacrifice for Yelp and go do that now. Only in the interest of giving the best review I can give. Not because I'm salivating at the thought of Fez while typing this. No, no. That's not why at all.

I had to cancel my membership after about 3 months because I was moving. I canceled at the end of September.  On October 1st I get an annual fee of $20.00 charged to my credit card.  I called, figuring it was a mistake. I hadn't even been there for an entire year and was definitely not planning on staying for one, considering I had already CANCELED my membership. The guy was completely unsympathetic and downright giddy that their stupid contract robbed me of $20.  I understand that I signed the contract, but really, charging me an annual fee 2 days after I cancel seems a little ridiculous! So add up the $50 sign up fee, $20+/month for 3 months and $20 "Annual Fee", I payed over $130 for three months of gym membership at that crappy gym. Totally not worth it.

I LOVE the Trader Vic's at the Beverly Hilton so the only reason I'm deducting a star from this one is because....it's not that one. That one's better.  But this one is still good. I was (and still am) considering collecting the little birds that come with one of the more froufrou drinks (can't remember which one), and marking them with the location and date until I have one from every location.  That would probably be the most fun thing to collect ever. But enough of the personal life aspirations, on to the review.  I almost don't want to say anything about the amazing happy hour because I'm afraid if word spreads too much it'll turn into Cafe Boa or basically any other place that has an amazing happy hour but only in the bar area so you end up packed like sardines in the eight foot space around the bar, while the rest of the restaurant is completely dead.  Seriously, why do places do that? It's really dumb.  Their happy hour rocks my world.  Food priced between $1 and $3. And these aren't wimpy little hummus dishes or chips and salsa. We're talking a quarter pound burger on ciabbatta bread with sweet potato fries on the side for $2. And they have it til SEVEN and they have it on WEEKENDS! The weekend drink specials are different, i think it's a wine and beer selection, but during the week it's $6 select signature drinks including the famous Mai Tai and my fav, the Navy Grog. I'm not sure of the exact ingredients but it definitely comes with rock candy in it so that pretty much blows my mind right there.  I've never been here besides for happy hour so I can't comment on the dinner dishes, but the happy hour food is good. The aforementioned burgers are actually really good! There's also crab rangoons, wings, spare ribs and a few other items.  We literally ordered "one of everything" once and our food bill was $18. Plus, I got to say "I'll take one of everything" which has kind of been a dream of mine for a while...  To summarize: Like the food, love the drinks, really love the prices. Can't wait to go back.  Oh I forgot to mention, all summer long they're doing half price bottles of wine Mon-Wed, all day.  It's like they can read my mind or something...

I like the Vig.  I am probably there more than any other place I've reviewed so far but I haven't given it a review yet because my experiences have been a little... schizophrenic. Some days it's awesome, the people are chill, the atmosphere is friendly.  Some days (especially Sundays) it's an absolute shitstorm, I literally get claustrophobic. The Sunday specials are amazing (though i think instead of calling it "half price bottles" they should just call it like it is: You get twice as drunk for the same amount of money) but it's getting to a point where if you're not there by 11 AM, you're not getting a table.  I like day drinking as much as then next person, but I wouldn't actually set an alarm to do it (unless football is involved).  I'm probably at the Vig at least once a week.  Why no 5 stars?  I mean , I clearly like it enough to go there as often as I do laundry (ok...more often), why the missing star?  Like I said: I LIKE the Vig. However, the reason I'm there so much doesn't have much to do with my tastes as it has to do with the fact that I literally live about an 8 minute walk away.  Six if I power-walk.  Someone could open a bar called "Screw Your Mother" in a shed next door to a whorehouse, and if I was able to get there quickly, and drink without risk of a DUI on the way home, I'd probably be there a lot also.  That said, I'm grateful that I can just go to the Vig instead.

The Vig's getting upped to 5 stars. I seriously don't really know what I was thinking with the 4 stars.  I think I maybe thought it was a tad overpriced and I'm not a fan of M-F happy hours that end at 6, but I'm willing to overlook that because the food is all AMAZING and the Sunday Specials make up for the Happy Hour thing.    The staff is great. I lost my phone there yesterday and felt really bad bugging the busy bartender to ask if one had been turned in, but he was super nice about it. My friend found it under an umbrella stand though. Thanks for asking, I know you were really concerned. Our waiter was also awesome and the manager helped us relocate after this random dude who reminded me of the guy from Mask (the Cher one, not the Jim Carrey one. That would have been awesome.) sat down at our amazing Bocce Ball table and WOULD NOT LEAVE. It was seriously ridiculous.  At least buy a round of drinks if you're going to bogard our table, Ginger!  But I digress.  The smoked salmon appetizer, the deconstructed fish tacos, and the Thai vings are my fav menu items. But I haven't had everything so that's not to say other items aren't equally amazing, because I'm sure they are.    Honestly guys, I think I'm still drunk from being there yesterday. Normally when that happens I hate everyone and everything, but I still love the Vig today.  5 EFFING STARS.

I'm sorry Upper Deck, I just have to. You just weren't good. At all. You had the UFC Fight on and didn't charge a cover, that was nice. But I wasn't really there to watch half-naked sweaty dudes embrace each other for the better part of 15 minutes, I was there to eat and drink and make inappropriate comments while the people I was with watched the fights. And I probably won't be back, because the eats sucked and while the drinks did what they were supposed to do, they didn't make up for the below average food and barely average service.   I'm adding an extra star for the delightful mural they had in the Women's bathroom, my favorite part of which is now uploaded under "Photos".  You're welcome.

This mall is located near my office and sometimes I head here to do a little shopping on my lunch break or right after work. I always end up spending way more money than I intend to here because I tend to duck into stores when I hear escalated yelling between two groups of obnoxious future GED recipients. This happens a lot.  Pros: Forever 21 (closest besides it is AZ mills), Macys, Victoria's Secret. Cons: Chick Fil-A closed, Unusually high risk of filling out some sort of police report.

This review is long overdue.  I'm apparently at this Wildflower so much I just became "Mayor" of it on FourSquare, and I suck at FourSquare so I never become Mayor of anything but I am probably at this place once a week or more so I suppose I deserve it.   My usual is the half roast beef and gorgonzola sandwich and a half soup or salad (depending on how hot is it outside).  The sandwich is heaven in sandwich form. The roast beef is perfectly rare and the gorgonzola is really piled on there and very tasty.   The Chopped Salad is another really good option that I partake in when I feel like behaving myself. Something about it (I think it's the couscous) makes it really filling for something I would imagine to be pretty low calorie (I don't know for sure because the nutrition information on their website has been "Coming Soon" forever. I'm half waiting for it in anticipation to figure out what I should be ordering, and half dreading finding out that my beloved roast beef sandwich is 1000+ calories, so wish me luck on that.)  Finally, the chocolate chip scone is absolutely delicious and practically loaded with chocolate chips.  Plus, it's in the shape a flower and if you don't appreciate flower shaped pastries, I don't want to know you.  As far as service goes, everyone is very friendly. However, I am consistently confused by their ordering protocol. You'd think, as their mayor, I would get some kind of instruction manual, but I haven't yet and it baffles me. Basically, they take your order at a counter, then someone delivers your food at a table, then when you're done you kind of awkwardly sit there and wonder whether it's appropriate to leave your empty dish there for said food runner to pick up, or if it is up to you to place your dirty dishes in the bus trays located very obviously around the restaurant. And what about tipping? I don't know! I usually end up putting my own dish in the bus tray in addition to leaving $1 on the table, just to cover all of my bases, but yeah, it's quite the dilemma and I'm way too neurotic to be put in situations like that, so that would be my only complaint. This isn't really Wildflower's fault, but more the doings of my own Larry David-esque idiosyncrasies which ensure I will make any situation I become part of as uncomfortable as humanly possible.  So take that for what it's worth.  Personal issues aside, I'd definitely check out Wildflower for the food and pastries. Plus if you go to this location and check in on FourSquare you get to see my smiling face, so that's clearly a bonus. I'm a fan!

I'm updating Wildflower to 5 Stars because I'm eating a chocolate croissant from there as I write this and it's making my hangover significantly more bearable. Anything that can make me feel less like stabbing something the morning after a bender deserves all the stars it can get.

I just want to update to say that since my review was posted i was contacted by someone at the Valley Ho who apologized for the misunderstanding and internal miscommunication about the pool guest policy and refunded my credit card the $25 extra guest charge, which posted to my card today.  I was incredibly surprised and impressed at this above and beyond showing of good faith on their behalf that I added a star to the review and will definitely consider going back.  Just wanted to make sure that was noted.

AMC Esplanade is by far the most successful navigator of the new "Dinner and a Movie" blue ocean the theater industry is starting to penetrate (that's right, I just referenced Blue Ocean Strategy, get over it).  No, it's not an extremely enlightened idea. I've been sneaking Bacardi into theaters since 2003 so it's about time theaters realize they should probably attempt to turn a profit off of it, but AMC really upped the game by not only providing me the option of purchasing alcoholic beverages from THEM, but also upgraded chairs, and a ton of delicious food (Including the obligatory $4 box of candy which is hilarious sitting next to a $9 burger. Like "Don't mind this $9 full meal over here, we still stand firm that Gummi Bears are worth their weight in gold.")  Yes, it's more expensive than a regular ticket. Almost double for the nice seats. But trust me, YOU WANT THOSE SEATS. You will regret not getting the $15 seats if you don't buy the $15 seats so just pony up the cash and delight in the fact that movie theaters are now almost as comfortable as watching a movie in your own home.   This theater is so nice it even makes bad movies tolerable. I saw The Master here and probably would have stabbed myself in the eye with my embezzled Bacardi flask if I didn't have a comfy recliner and three glasses of wine to get me through it. I seriously won't go to a movie anywhere else and I guarantee you'll say the same once you go. FIVE STARS.

I've been a fan of Pita Jungle since my ASU days, when I lived down the street from the Apache location. Now I live in the Arcadia area so this is the one we frequent. I haven't noticed a huge difference between the two locations, same great food, same stoned servers.  My usual is the Portabello burger. The balsamic marinade they use is fantastic. The presentation is a little messy, but once it hits your lips it's so good.  I pass on the new potatoes for steamed spinach and it's pretty amazing.  Everyone knows the hummus rocks. I love how they let you split up a small order between the roasted bell pepper and jalapeno cilantro. It's like a little hummus sampler for less than $5.  The service can be spotty, especially when it comes to drink refills, but I've surprisingly never had an order come out incorrectly. I normally would not be surprised by this standard service expectation being consistently fulfilled, but I have had some BAKED servers here, so the fact that they can remember my steamed spinach substitution each and every time is kind of impressive. So, good job, stoned servers. Maybe work on the drink thing, though.

I don't really know why I'm reviewing a gas station. The experience I had here was just too ridiculous to not write about. It was a Sunday, around 3:00 PM. My dad was in town and we had just bought live lobsters from AJs to cook at my house while watching the NBA Finals. I headed in here to buy him a pack of cigarettes while he was trying to find some special lobster knife at the Fry's across the street.  There were about 4 people ahead of me in line. The lady at the very front had a thick accent.  Not saying this in any way attributed to her bat-shit-crazyness, it's just part of the story. I'm not sure what she was buying, but she was paying mostly in change, and was a little short. She apparently had been arguing with the cashier for a while, long enough for a line of 5+ to form behind her, but I caught the tail end of the exchange.  Cashier: (Obviously annoyed) No, it comes to $5.85.  That's $5.10. You need more money. Crazy Lady: Ok fine! Here! (more change) Cashier: That's still not enough. You're short $.60. Crazy Lady: (Turns around, exasperated, to line of people who aren't too pleased with her) Does anyone have a dollar? Guy who may have been Jesus Christ: Oh sure, here you go. Crazy Lady (Yelling at Cashier): HERE! HERE YOU ARE! HERE'S YOUR MONEY! Cashier: (Rolls eyes and puts money in the register, goes to give Crazy Lady her $.40 in change) Crazy Lady: What?! I paid you with a twenty!  Me: (Leaves)

Only deducting a star because they are closed on Sundays. You may disagree with me on this. My Dad certainly does. He thinks it shows character to not compromise your own beliefs to make money. I think it shows common sense to allow me to exchange my money for your chicken any time I damn well please. So we agree to disagree.  Chick Fil A is definitely up there with Chipotle and In & Out as a top tier "Fast Food" place. Their chicken is juicy and tender and delicious and they come with tons of pickles, which I love. My similarities to Snookie end there. They also give you a bunch of different sauce options, so when you get a really good sandwich, you feel like you can kind of take some of the credit because you chose the sauce. I am all about heaping undeserved praise on myself, so this really helps with that. Okay, my similarities to Snookie end THERE.  Their fountain drink machine has both Coke Zero AND Diet Dr Pepper as zero calorie options, which is fantastic. I wish all places would start offering more diet options in their fountain machine. I mean, seriously, who drinks real soda? Besides, maybe, during a hangover? I just cannot fathom consuming 240 empty calories just so my Coke has real corn syrup in it. Actually, all places just need to just get those touch screen coke machines, including this Chick Fil A, if they haven't (which I'm not sure because I've only used the drive through).  Finally, the employees are all SUPER nice. At first I thought it was a fluke, and I just happened to get a ridiculously pleasant drive through attendant, but they've all been like that so it must be part of their training or something. Or maybe my Dad is right, and they're just in a good mood because they have Sundays off.

So after a ridiculous weekend  I decided there was absolutely no way I was doing anything today besides watching Real Housewifes of New Jersey and ordering chinese food. I actually managed to find 2 separate delivery menus, but ended up ordering from Asia Lee because they were cheaper and had a lower minimum delivery requirement. I also appreciated the "New York Style" note on the menu. An Arizona restaurant serving food from another country in the style of another state. It reminded me of a dream I had where I was the lead singer of a Green Day cover band that only did Journey songs, but in the style of Green Day. BTW, I'm totally starting that band.  I got hot and sour soup, kung pao chicken, and an eggroll. They're all sitting in front of me right now. Well, except the egg roll. That barely made it out of the bag.  The hot and sour soup is okay, but has too many undercooked carrots and not enough tofu.  The broth is a little weird too. If you like hot and sour soup, you might need to manage your expectations here.  Kung pao chicken is my go-to chinese entree because I need heat in my food or I feel like I'm not really eating. The heat is definitely lacking here, and I forgot to ask for Siracha. The lo mein is okay but also a little bland.  I'm still eating it, but not as quickly as I should be, because it's not that good. Plus, it's hard to eat while simultaneously being sickened by the atrocious hair on Real Housewifes of New Jersey. But that's not Asia Lee's fault. Two stars.

Despite the fact that I was once in this restaurant while it was literally HELD UP AT GUNPOINT, I am still giving it 4 stars.  If the whole nearly dying in an ill-conceived fast food restaurant heist thing hadn't happened, I would totally give it the 5th star. El Pollo Loco is so freakin good.

There are few places I loathe more than the post office. I find it worse than the DMV for several reasons, the first of which being who has to go to the DMV anymore? I don't think I've been since I got my Arizona license and while it wasn't the most fun I've ever had, I feel like it's really getting an unfair reputation as the worst government establishment to ever exist, as that distinction clearly goes to the post office.  Mailing packages is something I do much more often than going to the DMV and going to the post office (particularly my post office on 20th and Camelback) is enough to ruin your whole day. It's hot, everyone's rude, there's always a long line and it's hard to tell where it stops and starts because people are tying up their loose ends everywhere, nobody EVER has a pen (including the employees which you'd think would be kind of standard), and it's just a generally unpleasant experience all around.  Oh, on top of that, my post office decided they were going to be the only establishment in the world with the operating hours of 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM, despite the fact that I'm pretty sure most of the general public works 8-5. Seriously, whose idea was that?   I'm not sure why it took me this long to realize that, unlike issuing Driver's Licenses, OTHER companies can actually mail my packages for me.  Private sector companies!  Companies that compete with other companies! Companies with employees that actually seem to care about their job (or at least not getting fired from their job)! Companies WITH PENS!!!  UPS is a good example of one of these companies and this particular UPS is my favorite.  Their employees are very friendly and helpful. On my most recent visit, my package was just barely at the first class weight limit (going over would have doubled my shipping costs) and I wanted to add a card.  The employee behind the counter made some small adjustments to my package (cut some cardboard here and there) to reduce the weight and save me some money, which I really appreciated.  She even gave me a pen to fill out my card!  I thought pens were unheard of in the shipping world and here's UPS throwing them around willy nilly. It was fantastic!  Yes, they are slightly more expensive, and their packing services (Where they pack and label your packages for you. Yes, I've done it. Yes, I'm lazy.) can get really pricy, but for your average run-of-the-mill, not-too-heavy package, I'd say the slight cost increase is WELL WORTH avoiding the time and frustration that inevitably comes with a post office visit. Plus, they have pens.

The best cupcake I ever had. Which means, based on my experience with cupcakes, Sprinkles Red Velvet is officially better than:  - Cupcakes purchased at several bake sales between 3rd and 5th grade  - Cupcakes my boss sometimes brings in from his wife - St Patrick's Day cupcakes I once bought at Fry's on March 18th because they were 50% off.  So maybe I'm not the cupcake connoisseur I'd like to be, but that was  a damn good cupcake.  A little heavy on the icing, but the cake was perfectly moist and delicious. At $3.50 a pop, I suppose the prices could be lower, but the cupcake didn't disappoint so I can't be too angry about the $1-$2 upcharge from the Church Bake Sale down the street. Or Fry's on March 18th.

I had been meaning to visit this place for a while, though I'm not sure why. I'm not a big bbq fan but driving by it on the way home all the time kept reminding me how I'd never been. I dragged my poor boyfriend there two nights in a row (Sunday and Monday) to be met with a CLOSED Sign. Finally at about 4 pm the following Saturday, a rude employee at the original place we were planning left a sour taste in our mouth and I just had a feeling they would make it better. And they did.  I had only been to Greasy Tony's a few times but I vaguely remember what the inside looked like and this looked absolutely nothing like it. It looked...clean. That was the major distinction. There's a liquor bar in the front which has a "Blue Collar Beer Cooler" with beers like PBR and Mickeys for $1.50 which is freakin awesome. I am all about places that recognize malt liquor for the delicacy that it is. This time, though, we got the Sangria, which I liked but my boyfriend thought was too sweet. He had never had Sangria before so I think he just might not like it in general.   After looking through the menu on the wall, I randomly decided I was going to get ribs. I don't know why. I'm not a big rib eater. I can't even remember the last time I had them before then. There was some specials posted outside that included a spinach salad with shrimp skewers and I sat down almost 100% sure that was my order. But at the last minute I got ribs, and I'm really glad I did. My boyfriend decided on the salmon burger.   After we placed our orders we got our deviled eggs which were really good and a nice starter. We both love appetizers but the menu at this place doesn't really feature any unless you consider splitting an order of sliders to be an appetizer. So these were great. We actually ended up buying 6 more to go for 50 cents a piece to nibble on at home.  A few minutes later, our food arrived. I guess I've never had good bbq before because I have never tasted smokiness like I did with these ribs. It was interesting. The sauce was also very good, sweet but tangy. For sides I got the yam planks, which were awesome, and this kind of weird cucumber salad with sour cream and dill dressing. It was interesting, but also very good at the same time. I tasted the salmon burger and it was good, but I'm not a huge salmon fan unless it's sushi or lox. My boyfriend liked it but said he preferred the salmon B.L.T. at 4 peaks because it was like a salmon fillet as opposed to a salmon patty. After we finished most of our food (I had to take a few ribs home) and the table was cleared (except for our pitcher of sangria) we received a little mini dessert: a few tiny squares of pineapple! It was a really cute touch.  The server was very friendly and everyone checked on us to make sure we were doing well and everything tasted good. Overall a great late lunch that made us complete forget about our previous poor experience. We were two happy CAMPers. (GET IT???? HAHAHAHAHAWOW THAT WAS LAME.)   Seriously though even if you don't like bbq check this place out it was definitely worth it. Oh and our entire meal was only like $45. Without the sangria and to-go deviled eggs it would have been closer to $25.

I wish I didn't have to do this, but after last night I cannot have my name attached to a 4-star review of this place. It is a personal pride issue.   I haven't lived in Tempe for about a year now so the last time I was here was at least before October 2008.  My boyfriend and I decided to go back last night after watching Man V. Food Austin and getting a serious craving for BBQ. I checked the menu online and noticed it had changed quite a bit. A lot cheaper and lot less variety items. But they still had the deviled eggs (that used to be AWESOME) so I figured it was probably owned by the same people, they just are now catering more to the ASU Crowd.    I do not see HOW this could be under the same ownership as it was a year ago. The quality of food dropped TREMENDOUSLY. We decided to split a sampler, which consisted of BBQ chicken, pork, brisket, and 2 ribs. What came out was 2 okay ribs, 3 piles of cold shredded meat, all of which tasted very similar, that each had a drizzle of generic bbq sauce on top, and weird, not-good-at-all bun.   The "Yam Planks" were soggy and overseasoned. The wings were bearable, but no better than any sports bar. Plus, they were the crispy, breaded kind like hooter wings, which I'm not a huge fan of. The only good part of the night was the $3.00 32 OZ Pitchers.   I feel kinda bad updating, because the owner seems really nice, and our crappy BBQ platter was comped (we didn't even complain about it, she must have just known it was bad) but I have to because of how much I raved about this place before and how much it has changed.

For one thing, I'd like to let everyone know that Roka Akor officially has the best looking male staff ever.  I mean, are they kidding me with this? It's like they were ordered from a damn Abercrombie catalog.  At the risk of sounding like a total creeper (too late), that was almost as good as the food.  All creepiness aside, a coworker took me here for a belated birthday dinner using a localdines.com coupon and everything was perfect from start to finish. To start with, she somehow got her dates mixed up and the coupon had actually expired in August, but the awesome manager reissued her a new one AND let her use it on a Saturday (despite the new stipulations saying otherwise), which was very, very nice of her, considering it saved us $80 on our meal.  We both got the Summer Tasting menu. The softshell crab salad appetizer was incredible. The roasted peppers were very good too, but seriously, just get the soft shell crab. I mean, it's freaking deep fried crab. We also had an order of butterfish tataki because we had heard amazing things about it. It wasn't QUITE the mouthgasm I expected, but I think that may have been a result of obscenely high expectations. It was still very good.  I got Salmon as my entree which had an awesome charred finish and really good flavor. She got the cumin rubbed pork, which was perfectly seasoned and pretty much amazing all around.  The portions are way larger than I would expect for a fancy schmancy place like this. I don't even know how someone would finish a whole tasting menu, considering they give you like a pound of rice (which is more like a delicious mushroom risotto) for two people. We definitely couldn't finish it, but we still managed to pretty much inhale the green tea custard with banana foam dessert. So, so, SO good.   Our server was very personable and knowledgeable on both the menu items and the history of the restaurant. They were also awesome enough to bring us two glasses of champagne after dessert for my birthday! They said they usually do free dessert, but since we already had dessert with our tasting menu, I got booze instead! Always an appropriate substitution.  I thought the menu would actually be a lot pricier than it is, but it's really not bad enough that I can't see myself returning in the near future, particularly for the atmosphere (and by atmosphere I mean hot waiters...okay seriously, I'll stop now).  Definitely a five star experience! Can't wait to go back to try the sushi.

My dad is amazing. You know how guys always fear girls with "Daddy Issues" because they're usually extremely effed up after being utterly neglected by their father throughout their formative childhood and therefore seek the approval of men via ridiculous drama-filled dating antics for the rest of their life? Yeah, I'm not one of those people. My dad is one of my best friends. I even started giving him the fist bomb, complete with the added explosion, to celebrate our comradery.   My dad comes into Phoenix to visit me about twice a year. Clearly, I bookmark the most expensive places that I could never go but would really like to visit for times when I know he will be in town. Mastro's was one of those places. He took me and about 8 of my closest friends out to dinner here and it ranks as one of the greatest meals of my life.  We started with a the seafood tower that came with unbelievably fresh seafood (even for non-arizona standards) complete with a dry ice presentation that made us the center of attention for at least 15 seconds.  Heellllls yeah.    The food was amazing, but at $50 a plate, it should be, so I won't elaborate too much. What was surprisingly awesome was our server. He wasn't at all stuffy or condescending, looking at our table of many twenty somethings accompanied by one somewhat obnoxious 50 year old (my dad).  He even politely played along with my dad's joke of leaving a Giant Eagle "Frequent Shopper" card as payment for our bill of well over $500.    One of the best nights of my life, period. If I can ever afford it again, I wouldn't hesitate to come back.

If you're reading this review, I'm assuming that you're considering to, against your better judgment, try the old pizza-hut-looking Greek place with a random drive through that you pass by on the way to Pita Jungle but you're thinking "It can't be as good as Pita Jungle. I mean, it's a drive through!"  To you, I have two things to say:  1) For a place that has "Pita" in its very name. Z's kicks Pita Jungle's hippie little ass as far as delicious, pillowy, perfect little pitas go. Oh my god they are amazing, I could eat them all day. 2) The drive through is actually Z's Greek's best asset, because the inside kind of reminds me a dumpy fast food place and the drive through makes it a convenient place to pick up food that isn't the complete garbage that comes out of most drive through windows.  Actually, one of the hardest drives I ever have to make is the 2 mile drive from the end of the Z's Greek drive through to my condo.  The smell their delicious gyros infiltrates my car and makes it impossible to concentrate on anything other than GETTING THE EFF HOME TO GET THIS FOOD IN MY MOUTH. I'm an even bigger driving hazard than usual, putting my own life at risk in the name of pita, but it is totally worth it.  I usually get the Chicken Souvlaki pita, stuffed with juicy marinated chicken and a side of tangy tzaziki (I add the sriracha myself), and a small Greek salad, loaded with enough feta cheese it's probably not even a healthy choice anymore. I also LOVE their avgolemono soup when it's not 1 million degrees (though I can't pronounce it and look like an idiot when I try).  I can usually get delicious, filling dinners for me and boyfriend and get out of there for less than $20, which makes it a great, inexpensive, healthy-ish option for nights when I don't feel like getting out of a damn car, letting alone cooking an entire dinner.  So to answer your questions: Yes, you SHOULD try the questionable looking Greek place, yes, they ARE better than Pita Jungle, and yes, drive thru is always the way to go (unless they remodel their inside, which I would totally love, but I don't think it's quite made it to their business model roadmap.) Four stars!

I've been here a few times and have always been satisfied, especially since I've discovered the eggs with wild mushrooms dish.  If you're a mushroom fan, it's definitely a must-try.  My mom came in town this weekend and I took her here Friday morning.  She had it, said it was the best breakfast she ever had, then asked if I wanted to go again Saturday morning, and she ordered the same exact thing. Also, their lemonades are really tasty mixed with iced tea.  They have mint in them.  It's yummy.  Their hash browns are good. You can also get tator tots, which taste like tator tots from anywhere else...but tator tots are always good.   It is small and does get crowded on weekends, but the wait is generally fast even if you have lots of parties in front of you, because they tend to turn over tables quickly.  There's actually a note at the bottom of their menu that essentially reads "When you're done spending money, get the eff out."  Okay, it actually says something about being polite and cognizant of the people waiting for a table, but I don't think my interpretation was very far off. The meals are about $8-$10/each, which is a little pricey for breakfast, but the quality is good and the menu is more varied than you would find at a Denny's or IHOP, so I think it's worth it. Never had a problem with the service at all.  I'd definitely recommend giving it a try.  Especially the minty lemonade.

A coworker tried to make out with my boyfriend at happy hour here and I still freaking love it! I mean, what a great time, right? Sake bombers, sushi, random drunk broads coming on to your boyfriend because you spent too much time playing with the toilet controls in the bathroom?  Seriously girls, be careful in there.  Thankfully, my boyfriend did not give in to Drunky McSluttersons advances. However, the fact that she even had the gall to attempt it is really a testament to how awesome Geisha A Go Go's happy hour is. Chick was wasted. Hard not to get drunk when everything on the damn drink menu is half off! I think we were drinking $3 beers and $1 Sakes. $1! Truly wonderful.  The "House Maki" is half off also, which usually means basic rolls like California and Tuna, but nothing fancy. Geisha A Go Go's "House Maki" includes quite a few of the fancier roll selections, including one of my faves, the rainbow roll.  The sushi is really nothing to write home about, but when you got a nice buzz going on with aforementioned $1 Sakes, you don't really notice.  To recap: Happy Hour is awesome, Sushi is Okay, Bathrooms are time consuming, Don't take slutty coworkers.

I like to get pedis at this place after (or sometimes during...shhh) work on Fridays. They're only $18 and they really work for it. Neck massage, foot massage, hot towels for your calves, if they served booze I would pretty much be in heaven. I've also gotten really good eyebrow waxes here. It's clean, the people are nice, and I've never had to wait long. I've been to quite a few strip mall nail salons and this one is definitely my favorite.

I went here today for my bi-monthly eyebrow wax and I made a note that I have to update because since my last review this has really been my go-to place for eyebrows and they've always been great. This in large part has to do with the fact that they appear to now have a dedicated wax lady on hand, instead of just letting whoever isn't doing a pedicure take care of you.  I'm really mad at myself for this, but I cannot remember her name! I know it starts with a Z, so that should narrow it down for you. For the sake of this review, I'll act like we're old friends and Z is my cute little best friend nickname for her. Z is great. She always compliments my eyebrows and never asks if I "want upper lip". She is quick and accurate and she hardly ever has to go over my eyebrows with a tweezer to get all the strays she missed with the wax. I really hate that. I have pretty strong eyebrows. Not sure if that makes things easier or harder on her, but she always does a good job. Well worth the $8+Tip (bring cash though, because they charge $1 to use the card swiper).   G + Z = BFF 4 Life

I'm giving this place two stars because the food isn't THAT bad, albeit horribly overpriced and obviously not grilled to order.  Now, if I were giving stars for the number of times I unintentionally saw my waitresses... ahem...unmentionables, this place would get eleventy one stars.  I know it's a gimmick, but I really don't need or want to get a full view of my waitresses crotch while eating.  There's a reason strip clubs have buffets.  Nobody wants naked people serving them food. Speaking of food, the burgers are eight bucks.  Eight freakin bucks.  You realize that that's about how much a burger at delux is?  Of course, the sides don't come with your eight dollar burger.  They're a la carte.  So you want a burger, fries, coke and maybe a tip for your half-naked waitress, $15 easy.  Save your money and go to Chuck Box.   The burgers are better and the employees actually wear clothes.

Average to good food if you're hungover or drunk. Haven't eaten there on any other occasion so can't speak to that. Might have given them three stars had it not been for the STUPID ASS CURB that extends PAST the drive through window on your right therefore forcing you to drive your car along the left side of the road like we're in god damn England. I LIVE IN AMERICA, LOS CERRITOS! I INSTINCTIVELY VEER MY CAR TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF ANY ROAD I'M ON. PLEASE DON'T BLOCK MY NATURAL PATRIOTISM WITH A GOD DAMN FOUR INCH PIECE OF CONCRETE.  So yeah, if you haven't guessed, I romp that curb every time I go through the drive through there and it moderately irritates me.   Service is slow. Hot sauce is weak. Two stars is all they get.

I like to be a little stingy with my cash during the week. This serves two purposes:  1) It makes me feel not as guilty about my inevitable weekend splurges  and 2) Limiting my spending also tends to limit my drinking, which tends to limit my weekday hangovers, which tends to limit my chances of unemployment. Follow?   However, reason number two may not apply much longer as I have recently discovered the joy of what I've been calling "Recession Happy Hour".  This involves me stopping by Fresh & Easy on the way home from work, picking two bottles of their $2.99 wine, and hitting up the end of aisle 3 for some 50% off, expires-tomorrow-so-eat-it-tonight appys! It's always a surprise what's there, but who doesn't like surprises? I've managed to pick up bargain hummus, sushi, shrimp ceviche, and ahi tuna salad from that section, all for 50% off of the already cheap prices. Oh, and did I mention the wine is less than $3? I can usually get out of here without spending more than $10 and my happy hours end up just as happy. Granted, they're spent on my patio and not at a bar.  Basically, because of Fresh & Easy, I can be frugal with my spending without compromising my drinking. If that doesn't deserve five stars, I don't know what does.

I usually don't review places that I've only been to once, but I'm a lazy asshole with my hair and tend to go upwards of 3 months between trims, so who knows when I'll be back and I wanted to make sure to give them their review while my last visit was still fresh in my mind.  I went a couple weeks ago after purchasing a LivingSocial.com coupon for a $100 Brazilian Blowout.  I may seem like a relatively low maintenance kinda girl, but believe it or not, it actually takes a ton of time to look like I put no real effort into my appearance. My hair takes FOREVER to blow dry and once it's dry it's a huge frizzy, wavy mess that I have to meticulously straighten, piece by piece, just to get it to look like my college roommate's hair did after she stepped out of the shower and let it air dry for 10 minutes. Bitch. Point being, I'd been interested in this new Brazilian Blowout treatment for a while, as it was supposed to fix these horrible first world problems I had, and I was super excited when I saw the coupon to get one for a hundo, as they are usually priced at $250+.  I'll start with reviewing the treatment, just because almost every time I tell someone that I did it they tell me they are considering it and ask about my results. I'm relatively happy with it, though I'm still debating whether I will go back for one at full price once it wears off. Yes, it does shave about a half hour off my time spent getting ready in the morning. I can blow dry my hair in about 15 minutes, and then only have to take a flat iron to a few wavy pieces before I'm good to go. However, I feel like it did take away some volume and texture, so I actually think my hair looked better prior Brazilian Blowout (and after spending 45 minutes on it). This slight negative aspect of the treatment has no bearing on my review, however. Patty executed the blowout perfectly. Demoting a star for the salon because of the result of the treatment would be like faulting your bikini waxer because you don't like the breeze. Obviously, it's not their fault.  Back to the salon. To start with, they serve beer and wine. If you know me, you know that I'm of the strict belief that booze makes everything better. Hell, I'd probably enjoy a pap smear if it came with a mojito, so a glass of chardonnay with my hair appointment was a solid win.  My stylist, Patty, was awesome. I'm normally not a big talker in the salon chair. I hate small talk, so when stylists try to coax a relationship out of me by asking banal questions, I usually go right to the magazine. However, Patty and I chatted the entire time and by the end of my appointment I was pretty much reading my incoming texts aloud to her, so that's definitely a good level of trust to have with the person who is currently steaming formaldehyde two inches away from your brain.  The rest of the staff was very friendly as well, and they carry Tigi products, which I love. I'm not sure of their regular services pricing but the Brazilian Blowout is very reasonable at $225.  Patty even told me that she's currently doing $150 for first timers, so if you've been considering it, that is a steal. I've been a bit of a salon hopper since I moved to Phoenix, but I'll definitely be coming back to Salon Krush, if only for the free glass of wine. Five stars!

The last time I was here I went with two female co-workers who were mildly obsessed with the idea of me dating our waiter. I'm no stranger to objectifying cute male wait staff (cough*Roka Akor*cough), but even I felt uncomfortable for him after he had to endure approximately 3 hours of merciless cougar flirting followed by loud encouragement for me to take a more active approach to my dating life by hitting on him. I felt like I was having dinner with my two pimps, but he was a total pro about it and it ended up being an incredible meal!  I had been to Sens once before where I had the most amazing Pimm's Cup ever. I freaking love Pimm's Cups, and only a handful of places in Phoenix serve them, so when I get a good one, I remember it vividly (well, as vividly as i can remember things that occur on patios at 1:00 AM on a Saturday).  After going for dinner a few weeks ago, I had the same thing and it was just as good, even though I wasn't nearly as drunk as I was the first time. Since my BAC fluctuates like Kirstie Alley's waistline, that's about all the consistency I can ask for.  We ordered a ton of food, which seems to mostly be served small-plate style with 4 or 5 servings per order. This is perfect for me, because I tend to get bored easily and after a few bites of the same thing, I'm ready for something else (this might explain why my co-workers feel the need to take control of my dating life).  Everything we ordered was fantastic! We started off with sizzling shrimp in a spicy red sauce. The shrimp was perfect and sauce was actually spicy. Nothing pisses me off more than when restaurants cater to the wimpy masses by having their "Spice-O-Meter" equivalent to that of a kindergartner with an ulcer. The soup gyoza, bacon wrapped dates, sugar cane pork, and bacon wrapped okra were all just as good.  For dessert we had bacon-wrapped lychees (bacon was clearly the theme of the evening) and it was pretty much the perfect conclusion to the fantastic meal.  Even though I've only been to Sens twice, it's slowly creeping up my list of favorite restaurants in Phoenix and will probably only continue to climb as I visit more often. Maybe next time I won't bring my pimps (but no promises).

Hanny's drink menu has more options than eTrade, so obviously I freaking love it. It also makes me feel like I'm in that scene from the end of Drop Dead Fred when she's in the big scary house. Don't know why it reminds me of that scene..maybe the high ceilings? But that's pretty cool too.  One star deduction only because if I worked at place with a drink menu this freaking awesome, it would be all I'd ever want to talk about. In fact, I don't even WORK there and I still find ways to bring up Hanny's drink menu in regular conversation. But try to engage your bartender and two times out of three (I say this because there were three bartenders when we went and I tried to talk to all of them and only of them humored me), you'll get the cold shoulder. That's right, you will get #2 of the top ten ways to say no to drugs, circa  the D.A.R.E. program, 1994.   Anyway, I've been here a few times and have always had fun, mostly because I am all about the Pimm's Cup so if it's anywhere on a menu, I'm probably having a good time. I told my boyfriend that Hanny's was special because they actually served real Pimm's Cups and most places can't. He didn't believe me and responded that he's sure Ocean Club could serve a Pimm's Cup. I responded that I have already tried (I haven't) and they couldn't (I wouldn't know, I haven't tried). Just so you all know how I roll when it comes to challenging my unchecked facts.  I also had some Absynthe (this is what I wanted to ask the bartenders about when I got THE COLD SHOULDER). It was okay. It tasted like Sambuca but was a lovely shade of green. I don't think the kind they sell here in the U.S. have hallucinogenic properties but it was about my 6th drink of the evening so I obviously had a good time with it.  I haven't had the food but I will definitely be back for some more Pimm's Cups. I don't give a shit if Ocean Club has them.

I find my reaction to Posh similar to Will Ferrell's reaction to Jersey Boys in the criminally overlooked 2010 feature film "The Other Guys". It's not great, it's FANTASTIC. You guys totally undersold it! Wow, what a restaurant.  Actually, the basis for that comparison stems from feeling the need to assuage the fear that "I'll pay so much money and won't get enough food". I just bought tickets to see Jersey Boys in Vegas. You know how much the tickets cost? $76/each. More than a 5 courser at Posh PLUS a couple glasses of wine. Jersey boys was about two and a half hours. Five courses at Posh, if you're really enjoying yourself and your company, can easily take that long. The difference is that Jersey Boys does not feed you (well, it does, but in a different way). Point being, going to Posh isn't a meal, going to Posh is an experience. And, in my opinion, it's worth every penny.  I've been several times, including taking my Mom when she was in town from Cleveland, Ohio. Needless to say, she freaking loved it. Not that she's an inexperienced diner. She's from New York and considers Mario Batali a God among men, but according to her, dining at Posh was like being a judge on Top Chef. She didn't specify which judge but I'm going to go ahead and veto Padma because she is just unbearable. But I digress.  I've been exposed to foods at Posh that I wouldn't have had anywhere else. I don't want to screw up the proper dish descriptions so don't take this too literally but I've had chilled cucumber soup with a lime-chili oil, ahi tuna sashimi with wasabi and soy pearls, mother effin sweet breads (which everyone told me I should mark off but I didn't because I've never had them, and even though I might not necessarily ORDER them, I'm glad I tried them), and of course the creme brulee torched-style foie gras which is quite simply the most decadent thing I've ever eaten. And I've had bacon flavored ice cream. Again, I'm sure I'm butchering these courses but it's from my hazy wine memory and just trust me, they were all good.  While I think you would be fine with five courses (it's my typical order..since the first is always a soup or salad and the last is a dessert), more courses is always better. I mean, you're already there. Might as well give them as many opportunities as possible to blow your mind. Trust me, they will.  If you haven't gone, you should go. You won't regret it. Same goes for Jersey Boys, but that's a different review.

So, I'm a little bit of a junkie when it comes to online restaurant offers like Groupons and Restaurant.com vouchers. I'm seriously like a hoarder with those things. I think it comforts me to know that if I ever were to lose my job and all of my money, I would still have numerous restaurant gift certificates to survive off of, not to mention 10 days of free yoga, 2 hours of ice skating, and a mani/pedi!  Pretty decent lifestyle I'll have going on, despite complete and total financial failure.    One really good thing about the gift certificates is it allows me to check out places I probably wouldn't visit otherwise, particularly places that happen to be right next to a Five Guys and have entrees that cost more than $12. However, I had a $25 gift certificate telling me the Regions would be worth a shot, and so we went.  It was so worth it.  I mean, our bill came to $11, so they would have had to eff up pretty hard for me to feel like I didn't get my money's worth, but I would have been happy with this meal even without the $25 off the top.  We started with the pear salad which was HEAVEN.  The pear slices tasted like pie, no joke. Pie on top of salad: my kind of freaking salad.  For our entrees, I had the Club Sandwich, which I have no complaints about, and Coda B. got the half roasted chicken. I don't know what the hell I was expecting when the dish is called "half roasted chicken" but it was a TON of delicious roasted chicken. The cornbread side was really good also. So good in fact, that throughout the course of our meal I continually brainstormed dishes that could be made better with the addition of cornbread. I thought of cornbread shepherd's pie, cornbread chicken pot pie, and cornbread bread bowls, but instead of cheese on the inside, delicious butter.  Tell me that doesn't sound amazing and I will tell you you are a LIAR!   Anyway, back from the cornbread, the server was very nice and patient with us as we dissected the menu before making our final decision. We had beer this time but their mixed drinks looked pretty interesting, so I'll keep that in mind for future visits. Coda B. had a Coors Light that we were charged $1.50 for. One dollar and fifty cents. Not sure if this is just a Sunday special or what, but it was an amazing surprise.  They just opened recently, which might be the reason for some of the less than stellar reviews, but I'm a fan. If you're really hesitant, just get a Restaurant.com gift certificate to check it out and I promise it will be worth all $11.

This review, and the five stars that come with it, is for one thing and one thing only: A cocktail called "Picoso".  Coda and I had a light dinner and drinks here on New Years Eve 2010, and I have l been craving this delicious beverage ever since.  Every single sip was a delight. When you drink as much as I do, it's easy to get bored with the usual "interesting" cocktails. I mean, how many places are going to carry Pomegranate Margaritas before people STOP getting excited when they see it on a menu?  When I say people, I mean me. I would literally take an IV of Pomegranate Margarita, I love them so much, but they've become so standard, I needed something new.  This drink they call "Picoso" was interesting enough to be actually memorable. The fact that I'm even using the word "memorable" in relation to New Years Eve is unheard of, considering I haven't remembered a New Years Eve since 1999. The hint of jalepeno was the perfect compliment to the muddled fruit and tequila.  This drink was enough to cut through my alcohol induced amnesia and take it's rightful place in my memories of fantastic drinks past.  I'm not even mad at the fact that it probably played no small part in me losing track of time and being in the restroom when the clock struck midnight. Oh well, I probably wouldn't have remembered that anyway.

I take my brows VERY seriously. Actually, I take eyebrows in general VERY seriously. They really make the face. Have you ever seen someone that has everything necessary to be considered conventionally attractive, and something is just a little off about them? It's probably their eyebrows. I'm happy eyebrows are finally getting the attention they've always deserved, if only because now strangers don't give me weird looks when I praise them on their brow game. They understand and appreciate the gravity of the compliment.  As important as my brows are to me, I haven't been super selective about who I let near them with hot wax.  My brows follow a pretty defined line and are kind of hard to screw up, so thankfully there have not been any casualties.  However, until going to 2 Sisters I didn't realize that no casualties does not necessarily equal an amazing job, and the ladies here have always done an amazing job.   I haven't had any other services (yet) but was just perusing their menu of services and noticed that a $40 facial COMES with a free brow wax (normally $12) and lip wax (normally $8) . Since I already come in for the brow wax and who couldn't use a lip wax every once in a while, the facial is basically free (spa math), so I'll be taking advantage of that next time.  Definitely recommend 2 Sisters for brows. The atmosphere is better than any other place you'd go and spend less than $20 and they really do a great job.  Plus, next time I see you in public I might randomly compliment you on your brow game so you have that to look forward to. 5 Stars!

I've stayed at the Biltmore twice, once was a five star experience, and the other was about a three, so I'll split the difference and give them a four.   The first time I stayed here was in a super cute cottage. We had fabulous service from everyone. The only complaint I had with this trip was that housekeeping knocked at 9 AM (which they did on my second trip too). I realize nine is not ungodly, but it's a little early to be hustled out of your room so someone can make your bed, that you would have never left if you didn't have to stop the persistent knocking from the other side of the door. So that sucked. But besides that it was a great experience.  This last time was okay. We got a great deal on the room and they let us check in super early, which was awesome. The air wasn't working when we first got to the room, but I'll let them off the hook for that because they quickly fixed it and the room was cool before the 4:00 check-in time, so for all I know that was their plan the whole time. My boyfriend spent the morning golfing and even though it was miserably hot,  had a great time. The bartenders at the pool were nice enough, and we were pretty obnoxious, so nice enough is pretty much all we could hope for.  One of the sinks in the bathroom didn't drain and the cosmetic mirror in the bathroom was broken (not the mirror the little thing that kept it stable in the wall), so that was a minor inconvenience that I wouldn't normally expect from resorts of this caliber.  We also got a couple in room massages, which were great, but then due to a misunderstanding with the credit cards on file (I used mine for the room, my boyfriend used his for the massages), I got charged for both the room AND the massages. And, god bless my boyfriend, but I really can't rationalize spending $400 on a couple 55 minute backrubs unless that back rub comes with, say, an iPod. I called Biltmore and they said they could reverse the charges and put them on another card, but it might be easier to just ask him for the cash. So he paid me back but I obviously wish I could have avoided it all together. I mean, that's awkward right? To have someone do a nice gesture for you and then you end up accidentally paying for the nice gesture so you have to awkwardly bring up that while the gesture was nice, you kind of can't pay for it and omg I already feel like I'm on an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm so I'll just stop right there and hope you get the point. It was very stressful for me.  Assuming you don't share my social etiquette neurosis, I'm sure you'll have a great  time at the Biltmore. The summer rates are unbeatable, and if you can stay at a Cottage do so because they are just adorable, especially by the little putt putt holes. Just make sure to double check your room upon check in and double check your folio upon check out and you'll be fine.

I went there yesterday and am going back again today. The carne asada, the guac, the beans, the salsa. It's all just perfect. It made my freaking day yesterday and let me tell you I had an AWESOME day yesterday. If you haven't gone, go. Now. That is all.

All right guys, I'm getting a little concerned. I see the reviews and that's all well and good, but every time I go into Sonora, it's empty! After the loss of Karey's Kitchen, I feel I have to take a more proactive approach. I went to Karey's Kitchen when I was hungover all the time, but apparently a restaurant cannot live on Georgeann G.'s hangovers alone (I know, it shocked me too).  Next time you think about going to Chipotle, come here instead! They can share the massive line Chipotle has from open to close every day! Don't get me wrong, I love me some Chipotle, but I don't want to lose Sonora, so I want to share the wealth a bit.  That's enough of my plea. Still 5 stars. If you look at the picture of the to-go order that I just inhaled while watching a Hills marathon in my living room, you'll see why. Delicious!

This place has only been open for about 3 weeks and I've already been here 4 times.  I've lived down the street from Hazelwoods for over a year and have also been there about 4 times. As you can see, I've decided on my walking-distance sports bar of choice.  They have a great, cheap happy hour that lasts until SEVEN. Which means I will never again risk death on the I-17 as I race home from work praying that I get to the Vig before 5:55 so I have enough time to order a drink and some hummus before prices go back up at 6:00. Instead, I will leisurely cruise on down to Zipps. Maybe I'll even stop at home first to change, something I would never even DREAM of when Vig was involved.  Zipp's freed me from the hell that is 4-6 Mon-Fri happy hour.  The $3 margaritas taste very much like the $6 Z Tejas 6th Street Margaritas. There's a limit of 3. I'm not sure if that's for cost control or safety liability, but 3 is enough to knock me on my ass, so I won't complain. The Golden Hot wings are amazing, and surprisingly hot. I would start with Golden Medium and then get a side of Hot if you think you can handle at. FYI: It makes people perspire.  I've yet to have an actual meal here, just apps and drinks, but the menu items look tasty (I'm especially looking forward to trying the Sweet Jalapeno Burger) and if the execution is on par with the mouthgasm that is the wings, I'm sure I'll be satisfied.

I grew up in Las Vegas. I was not introduced to the concept of "Last Call" until I moved to Ohio at 17 years old. It was a huge shock. I couldn't believe other people had the right to tell me when I could or couldn't purchase delicious alcoholic beverages. Despite the fact that I was 17 years old and I was therefore legally forbidden to buy alcoholic beverages for at least another 3 years, this "Last Call" business really chapped me.  I'm typically not ready to end the night just because Mr. Last Call wants to be a party pooper and rear his ugly head. I usually plan for this likely event beforehand, but I'm not going to say I'm a stranger to jumping in a cab at 1:50 screaming at the driver with the urgency some may reserve for labor pains that I need a liquor store PRONTO! This leads to me overpaying for the cab, overpaying for liquor, and generally overtesting my patience because apparently to some cab drivers "PRONTO" means "Drive Safely and Obey all Posted Speed Limits". Pussies.  This, my friends, is where the beauty of a liquor store with a built-in bar comes in. This way, when last call comes around, I merely need to mosey on down the hall to make my after-hours selection, and patiently ask my cab driver to take me to the destination of my choice. Everybody wins!  The bar has a great selection of beers on draft. On our last visit, which just happened to be Halloween night, there was not one but TWO different Pumpkin drafts. The ever popular Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter, and another one which I don't quite remember the name of, but it tasted like pumpkin pie in a pint glass. I was tempted to ask for whipped cream.   We experimented with several different beverages throughout the course of the night. I awoke the next morning to find a note written to myself in my phone that merely said:  los abbey angel share is the most delciousber of allll time  As you can clearly read, Lost Abbey Angel's Share is the most delicious beer of all time. They serve it here, for $13 a glass. It's totally worth it though. It's extremely strong and tastes like a combination of chocolate and jesus. Another win-win.  I'll definitely be back to Taste of Tops. Cab drivers everywhere rejoice.

I don't think I could ever give five stars to a restaurant that has a $67 entree and is located across from an H&M in a shopping mall, but Modern Steak got pretty close.  For one thing, their Retail Therapy drink is ridiculously good. Like, oh my god can I get an IV good. Like, it's happy hour and this drink isn't on the happy hour menu but I'm gonna order it anyway because it's just that good good. And don't let it's pink color and delicious taste fool you because two of them will have you on your ass, I know from experience (like I had to mention that).  The crab appetizer was heavily pimped by our bartender which I'm always skeptical of. I mean, how convenient that the most expensive appetizer on the menu is also your personal favorite, staff member who generally receives a percentage of the overall sale as compensation for your trouble? But, in this case, he was absolutely right because it is freaking incredible. Especially since it's pretty much served with a mason jar full of butter. Seriously, Paula Deen would have a hard time finishing it off. On our last visit we actually kept the butter and used it to dip our steak in. Which, if you've never done, is pretty freaking delightful. I bet Paula Deen's done it.  The salads are actually really decently priced for the  portion you get. I got the chopped salad, thinking it would be a wimpy little pre-dinner salad, and actually had to stop eating it for fear that I wouldn't have room for my rib-eye. And god knows rib-eye takes precedence over salad.  Which brings me to the meat. The rib-eye cut is HUGE and basically exactly what a rib-eye should be. It's a little salty, but not really in a bad way. It's just much saltier than steaks I've had at other restaurants. It's always been perfectly cooked and they'll always split plate it without any attitude, so that's nice.  All-in-all, I've never been disappointed at Modern Steak, but I've never been disappointed at Five Guys either, which is also located in the mall and priced about $50+/head less. But you can't get a Retail Therapy at Five Guys, so that gives Modern Steak a solid four stars.

So before I start my review, I'd like let Yelp know that I don't appreciate my Thai Lahna review disappearing. Where is it Yelp? I just went to the Thai Lahna business page and I know FOR A FACT I left them one review AND one review update and a CTRL+F for "Georgeann" isn't highlighting anything on either page of reviews. I needed that review as reference for this review, as I don't want to hold Touch of Thai and Thai Lahna to different standards. HOW FAIR AND BALANCED OF ME. But I digress.  So I originally was going to give Touch of Thai one less star than Thai Lahna. To me, the sauces just weren't as flavorful and the Thom Yom Gai wasn't as orgasmic. That's not to say it wasn't good. You know that saying "Sex is like pizza, even when it's bad it's still pretty good". Well, I've had some doughy, tasteless excuses for pizza and they were pretty damn awful, so I hereby propose to replace "pizza" with "Tom Yum Gai". I really feel like that could catch on.    Anyway, so with that in mind I was going to give this place three stars because I was PRETTY sure I gave Thai Lahna four (however, I have no way of knowing for sure because Yelp is censoring my shit like a god damn fascist). Upon further thought, I remembered that the main reason I gave Thai Lahna a star detriment was because of their kinda crappy service. Food takes a pretty long time and, while not rude, I wouldn't really call them "friendly" either. Plus, they only serve coke in a can. I've been in to Touch of Thai  for both eat-in and take-out and both times the service was fast and friendly, definitely nothing that would warrant a star deduction. So they go up to four stars, because that's pretty much what I'd give their food and with no service adjustments either way, I'd say that's fair.  To recap  Thai Lahna - One Star for Food + One Star for lack of service/fountain soda problems = Touch of Thai  I'd definitely go back. The great (albeit hidden) location right in Old Town, cute interior, and friendly service makes up for the minor taste issues. Besides, you know what they say about sex and Tom Yum Gai...

Cambodian is not a cuisine that comes up for most people during the "what to have for dinner" discussion, so it's not surprising that this restaurant is still a "hidden" gem (though it does always seem to have customers, which makes me happy).   I'm not sure why Cambodian food hadn't really caught on. If you consider where it is on a map (or discretely pull up Google to learn where it is on a map), you'll see that it's wedged between two countries whose cuisines have done quite well for themselves (Thailand and Vietnam). Cambodian food has similarities to both Thai and Vietnamese food, as well as its own signature dishes.  Now, I'm no Cambodian food expert (contrary to what I may have previously led you to believe) but I have enjoyed everything I've had from Reathrey Sekong so I think it's probably a good place to get it. Their basil seed drink is something everyone should try. I've also enjoyed their beef noodle soup (I don't think they call it pho but it's similar with a bit more garlic) especially the large amount of tripe. I plan on eating my way through this entire menu, especially the desserts, and I doubt I'll ever be disappointed.   Finally, I enjoy a good owner response and Reathrey Sekong really delivers on that front so bonus points for character.

I had no idea Yelp was full of such Sub Aficionados but I was not disappointed with Firehouse. I didn't even know about the steaming versus whatever debate but my sandwich (The Engineer) came with piping hot meat, gooey cheese, crunchy, delightful toppings, all on a delicious toasty roll. It was glorious.  The sandwich actually reminded me of  the Chicken Cordon Blue I used to get at a sub place called Penn Station in Ohio. Man, I loved that sandwich, but Firehouse is a good substitute. Now all I need is Skyline and White Castle and I won't even need to go home anymore!

You guys have no idea how long I debated whether or not to leave a review for Little Woody. It was pretty much a goal of mine to keep it as secret for as long as I possibly could, mostly because the place isn't that big, I live across the street, and I appreciate at least a foot of personal space.  Welp, that foot of personal space is almost gone now so I figure it's about the time to profess my love for this not-really-a-dive bar, especially since they just added the most AMAZING back room a bar has EVER had.  Seriously, I could set up a cot, eat, drink, and sleep in that back room and have absolutely no problems in life. They have shuffleboard, darts, and SkeeBall! Really, what more can you ask for?  In my original review of The Great Escape (R.I.P., gone but not forgotten), I concluded with "If they had shuffleboard, I'd bump them up to 5 stars"...Little Woody did me one better and got shuffle board while simultaneously getting rid of that weird old person basement smell the place used to have (and replacing it with the lovely smell of wood).    What really makes this bar though is that everyone is seriously so freaking friendly. Once a guy asked me to punch him in the stomach...SUPER friendly because I love punching people.  Another time we sat down at a random table and played a game of RCL with a group of complete strangers, obviously awesome.  One stranger let me play with his iPhone 5 the day it came out just because I noticed it. I've only been mean-mugged like once and those girls clearly got lost looking for Mint, so that's not the Wood's fault.  All in all, I love this bar, I can now loudly declare that I love this bar, and if you want to come and be cool and love this bar with me you can. Just leave the mean-mugging in Old Town.

Their food is okay. Nothing has ever really stood out to me (except the cookies), which is probably why I don't go in very often.  However, when I do go in, I am always reminded of the reason they will never, ever surpass three stars in my book, regardless of how delicious their cookies, or anything else they serve, is: THEIR STUPID, POINTLESS, FRUSTRATING ORDERING SYSTEM.  Honestly, I've probably gone to paradise about a half a dozen times in my life. Every single time, if you were to come up to me at my table and ask me "How did you get your food today?" I would be dumbfounded. I literally block it out, it is that irritating. Yes, I eventually end up at a table with a salad or sandwich, maybe a cup of soup, but no I can't help you, random stranger who also doesn't know how to order. I don't know how this happened.  A couple weeks ago my boyfriend and I went to this location.  We got to the back of the line and I literally turned to him and said "Their ordering system is really stupid. I don't know how to work it, I just know it's stupid. Just go through and do what the employees tell you and eventually we'll have food somehow."  This was actually one of the more stupid Paradise ordering experiences I had ever had, so it was nice for him to experience that on his very first visit. Long story short: We ended up ordering every item from the same employee though she kept directing us down this invisible assembly line of people only to meet us at the next station and take the rest of our order there. It was very confusing. So confusing in fact that the guy in front of us got so pissed off he complained to the location manager about their restaurant ordering workflow. If random customers are complaining to store managers about corporate wide ordering policies, maybe it's time to re-evaluate your stupid system that does nothing but make people feel awkward and waste everyone's time.

From the moment this Del Frisco's opened, I was hearing good things.  I believe the term "my new favorite restaurant" was uttered by at least one friend and  other reviews were similar.  However, there was one small but unforgivable issue that kept me from visiting: Del Frisco's did not recognize happy hour.  I repeat: DEL FRISCO'S DID NOT RECOGNIZE HAPPY HOUR.  Since Happy Hour is like a religion to me, this was unacceptable and I would not be patronizing their establishment.  However, I have great news for everyone (including them): DEL FRISCO'S NOW HAS HAPPY HOUR.  And it's a good one!  SEVEN days a week and it lasts til SEVEN each day.  We're talking double sevens here people, they really impressed me with that!  The ever eloquent Lance S. and I went before a movie last weekend and it was damn good.  Just a side note: Lance has been mixing coconut water with rum and using it as a hangover cure for at least a year now.  Del Frisco actually legitimized it and turned it into a drink called "The Morning After" and it is delicious.  I had the Jalapeno Marg which was pretty standard for a drink that many have added to their drink menu, but still good.  The real food standout was the tomato basil flatbread.  For $6 it's about the size of a small pizza (6 square slices) and the tomatoes are so freaking fresh, I started reminiscing about that Seinfeld epsisode where George is pondering why the tomato "never really took off as a hand fruit".  I would probably eat Del Frisco's tomatoes like an apple if given the chance, that's how wonderful they were.  All in all, a great addition to Esplanade, especially with the AMC Theater being my new most favorite theater in the world.  We'll be moving right next door in a week and I'm really glad Del Frisco's decided to come back from the dark side and add itself into my rotation.  I'm a fan!

Have you ever had a meal that leaves you equal parts full and unsatisfied? It happens to me all the time.   Here's the deal: When most people are starving they'll eat anything right?  Like, "Is there peanut butter or maybe some triscuits in the cupboard. Oh good, I'm starving. I'll eat those."   I'm the opposite.  A very common exchange in my life is:  Me: I'm staaaaarving.   Someone (slightly) more rational than I am: Um, there's a kitchen full of food right there. Me: No, I'm starving! I need something really good! I can't waste this!  Yes, that's right. I don't like to "waste" hunger.  And that is exactly what I feel like I did at Café Rio.  After reaching full-on STARVATION MODE one Tuesday Night, I set my sights on Taco Tuesday and began to research.  Yes, this is how seriously I take my bouts of hunger. It involves research.  After reading Yelp it appeared that both Café Rio and Rubio's had $1.50 tacos but Café Rio was a couple miles closer and Rubio's only had fish tacos on special so we opted for Rio.  Upon walking up to the entrance, we realized were surrounded by children, which was curious. The place seemed like Chipotle-esque fast casual Mexican. Certainly kid friendly but it's not like there was a damn play place involved. We felt like we were at a day care. It was extremely confusing.    So we get in line and have no idea what the hell is going on. It's hard to tell if they are an "order-off-the-menu" place or a "walk down the line and pick what you want you want" place. So I just shout three different types of meat at the guy behind the counter and hope for the best.  Finally, it appears like I've reached the portion of the line where I will be dressing my tacos.   "Do you want lettuce and pico de gallo" "Yes please"  No other questions followed.  I saw cheese. I saw beans. I saw rice.  Were any of these offered to me? No.  Finally when it became clear this was not a "point and get" situation, I asked the guy behind the counter if they had a hot salsa.  "We have our Salsa Fresca, it's the hottest we have, and it's FREE!"  Um, yes I would assume it's free considering you are a MEXICAN RESTAURANT and it is a side of SALSA.   Lance and I both got 3 tacos, I got an iced tea, and our bill was $16.23.  Now, I wasn't a math major, but that doesn't sound like $1.50 tacos to me. Turns out only one of the tacos we got was on special ($1.75, actually, though I did get my $1.50 number from Yelp so that's not their fault).  Grilled chicken and steak were not on special. All of the sudden, Rubio's started sounding really good.  We chose a corner table and proceeded to feed our starvation (did I mention that we were STARVING) while some Adderall-ridden 5 year old danced about 3 feet away from us.  Yes, I said dance. Girl was jumping up and down like she was at a damn Ke$ha concert with absolutely no regard for the people around her, which was probably just as well because we were too busy stuffing our faces with dry chicken, diced tomatoes posing as pico-de-gallo, and lettuce.  One thing I will say is the tortillas were delicious.  We go to leave and see a sign by the register: Children 6 and Under Get a Free Quesadilla.  Aha, mystery solved.  Probably the most satisfying part of our visit.  Moral of the story: There's a Chipotle across the street.  There's a Rubio's two miles away.  There's probably freaking peanut butter and Triscuits in your cabinet.  All of these would be better options than wasting your hunger on this place. Unless you're under 6 in which case, quesadilla party at Cafe Rio.

This place has an amazing daily happy hour that features $1 oysters, $5 house wine, and half price small plates, which include deliciousness like beef tartar and grilled artichoke.  Basically, rich people food without rich people prices, which I am all about.  I probably wouldn't come here during non-happy hour unless it was a special occasion.  The restaurant itself is beautiful with an open floorplan and wall to ceiling windows that can open which essentially puts the whole restaurant on a gigantic patio, perfect for when the weather is like this.  The only issue I had with the service was they put Lance and I at the smallest table in the world, during Happy Hour when they have half price small plates (and $1 oysters which we all know the monstrosity of tableware that oysters require).  I get that there were only two of us, and our server tried to time the dishes to we didn't get everything at once, but we definitely needed some real estate.  I'd definitely recommend their happy hour for when you want to live large on a small budget (and at a small table).

I'll start this review by divulging this shocking fact: I don't use iPhone covers.  I don't like the way they feel, I don't like how they mess with the camera flash, and I don't like my phone being any bigger than it already is.  I say "shocking" because while I, personally, don't think this is that weird, people for some reason act like I am jeopardizing the life of a newborn baby when they see my naked phone. I promise, people, I will use car seats.  Obviously, this preference may come with some collateral damage.  However, not as much as you'd probably think.  I've actually only cracked a screen once, and the result of that is this review.  I've definitely dropped my phone way more often than that, on all kinds of hard surfaces, and it's come up fine. But apparently this last one was the drop that broke the camels back because when I picked that sucker up after dropping it on my wooden kitchen floor, I was the one who was shocked.  The next day I called the Apple Store.  Since my phone was a 4S, and not a 5, they said they couldn't replace the screen. Something about a uni-something body design. I could buy a new 4s for $199 or, if I qualify for an upgrade I can get a 5S.  I don't use my upgrades if the phone I'm upgrading to has been on the market for more than a couple months (and I try not to use my upgrades on S versions) so that was a no go.  Plus the 5's dainty little body design makes me feel like I might have to use a case with it, which I'm not excited about.  So I started looking for someone who COULD repair it, and UBreakIFix came up. I called and they said they could do it, and before 5 that day, which was awesome news.  I dropped my phone off around 1:30 and was surprised at how nice the place was.  For some reason I was expecting a cramped, cluttered office with pieces everywhere, like a chop shop for phones, but the place was sleek, modern, and clean.  I felt very comfortable leaving my phone there, and I gave them my boyfriend's number to call me when it was done.  The work was solid 5 stars.  The phone came back good as new for $79.99 which is a steal considering apple wanted me to buy a new phone. The only thing I would say was lacking was the communication.  Since I was under the impression that they closed at 5, when 4:30 rolled around I started to get concerned.  What if he wasn't done by 5? Does he go home for the night and work on it again tomorrow? Does he stay late? Should I wait up after 5 passes? Should I be annoying and check on it? Obviously, I went with the last option and popped my head in, figuring if he's not done yet, I'll have a glass of wine at the Duck next door and wait.  He still wasn't done, but said he'd call when he was, before 5.   I'll pretty much take any excuse to drink at the Duck, so that was perfectly fine.  Then 5:05 rolls around.  I'm still not sure the uBreakiFix policy on staying late, so I call to see what's up. He is staying late, he's finishing my phone, and he'll call when he's done. I think he called at about 5:15, which isn't a long time really at all, considering how busy he seemed, I just wish I knew that "or a little after 5" was also an option from the beginning, or I wouldn't have freaked out so much as we were getting to closing time.  All-in-all though, I'd definitely recommend this place for psychos like me who don't use covers on their iPhones, or anyone who appreciates quality repair work  from a company that sounds like it was named by the guy who wrote "Gangnam Style".

Have you ever eaten somewhere and it was just so amazing and unique and awesome that you seriously thought about it, daily, until you could go again?  That was my experience with Miu's.  Literally the first thing that was brought to our table, the Dan Dan Noodle, was one of the BEST things I've ever eaten so it alone made me pretty much a convert. I was never a huge fan of chinese food in general so now I'm 100% positive I'll never have chinese anywhere else again. Because even though I'm not a fan of traditional american chinese food, I am a HUGE FAN of Miu's.  The second time I went with my Mom we had the Dan Dan and the Spicy Cucumbers.  FREAKING INCREDIBLE.  I don't know where they get their cucumbers. I don't care if it's a hydroponics lab located in that shady backroom they have, KEEP DOING IT.  The third time I went I had the Dan Dan Noodles, the Spicy Cucumbers, AND the Garlic Cucumbers, because that is how much I liked the Spicy Cucumbers, I wouldn't risk not getting it even if it meant just substituting another cucumber dish. Luckily, the garlic cucumbers were effing incredible as well (probably grown in the same lab).   For entrees I've had the Spicy Lamb Ribs, Chicken and Jalapeno (these are both similar in preparation and both amazing but VERY spicy. Like a delightful challenge), and the Kung Pao Chicken. The Kung Pao is probably the only thing I wouldn't get again, just because while I'm sure their food quality and preparation standards are much higher than, say, Little Schezwan down the street, I can still get Kung Pao at Little Schezwan.  I cannot get spicy lamb ribs that make me want to cry from both heat and sheer pleasure at same time.  So I'll stick to the dishes that I don't recognize at Miu's.  I will tell you that despite all my ravings about the food, I was A LITTLE hesitant of the 5th star due to the space. Yes I realize this is a chinese hole in the wall,  and trust me I do not normally deduct stars for places due to aesthetics (See: The Great Escape, Haji Baba, Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse) but there are some easily fixable things that can make the place a little more inviting.  Honestly this isn't an issue for me so much as I know it is for others (I once stayed at a sushi place despite seeing a cockroach because they gave me free sake bombers), but I swear to god if Miu's shuts down because too many people judge a book by its cover I will probably be depressed for like at least a week, so I hope they do make some improvements in that area.  I hate restaurant loss induced depression.

So I braved coming back to Snooze (on a Friday to avoid the weekend brunch crowd) and I have to admit, I actually LOVE the food here.  What comes out of that kitchen is freaking amazing.  I haven't had anything but benedicts, pancakes, and hashbrowns and they are, no exaggeration, the best benedicts, pancakes, and hashbrowns I've ever had anywhere.  Not sure if it was the fact that I was there during the work day on Friday or if my last visit was a complete fluke but my mom and I ordered at 10:44 and got our food (two benedicts) in about 10 minutes, which was a huge improvement from the last time I went (on a Sunday), so I feel I need to upgrade my review based on that experience which was definitely 5 Stars.  Yes there is a wait for a table, because the food is really, really good.  But they are SUPER accurate with their wait times so you should know what you are getting into before putting your name on the list. Plus there's an amazing Nordstrom Rack next door so in my opinion the wait is more like a welcome invitation to shop.  They text you when your table is almost ready, and there is plenty of stuff to do in Town & Country so it goes by pretty quickly, and as long as the food comes out as quickly as it did last time, the food is totally worth it.

Not sure why Whole Foods is the only grocery store that decided to also serve the wine and beer that they sell, but I love them for it.  To preface, I'm one of those weirdos that goes to sit-down restaurants and eats by themselves.  I actually like it.  The nice thing about this place is since it's a grocery store, you don't feel awkward about popping in for a glass of wine and a sandwich before you run your errands.  Just make sure to keep it to one glass of wine and make sure to eat, because drunk, hungry shopping at Whole Foods could quite literally bankrupt you.  They have an everyday happy hour that includes $2 off wine ON DRAFT.  I didn't realize this and got a regular glass of wine, then cursed my carelessness when I realized that one of my favorite wines, AZ Stronghold is one of their draft wines and would be $5/glass during happy hour, which is a fantastic deal.   The veggie burger and fries were both good, as was the wine I ended up ordering even though I didn't get the $2 off. Also, they didn't set up a separate POS for the restaurant so you are not given the opportunity to tip on your credit card receipt. I'd bring a couple bucks for that., but I think the employees must get paid full wage/salary and therefore are probably not getting as screwed as I originally thought they were, so that's good.  All in all, a great little place to get a pre-shopping drink and numb the pain away from the fact that you are probably about to spend more on produce than the amount of your first paycheck, so I'm a fan.

I come here for gel nails. I don't know how, but the gel nails I get here look the best, last the longest, and destroy my nails the least out of the 10+ places I've had gels done in Phoenix.  The waiting area is a little cramped and I wish all nail salons would present gel colors in a better way than that weird plastic rolodex of fake nails, but I will keep coming back to this place because I'm lazy and clumsy and bright nails make me happy.  Plus it's next to a Chipotle and a Total Wine. I could pretty much live next to a nail salon, a Chipotle, and a Total Wine and never leave the thirty yard radius of my house, so I'm a fan.

Firstly let's get one thing clear: New Orleans is my jam. I freaking love that city. I love that nothing ever closes. I love that people speak French. I love that you can take drinks TO-GO from restaurants. I love that it is simultaneously home to some of the finest white-glove restaurants in America as well as some of the seediest, most degenerate bars that have ever been built. And most importantly, I LOVE the food.  So when I saw that Angry Crab, a Mesa restaurant that I've been meaning to get my Cajun fix from for months, was opening a new location down the street from my house, I was beyond thrilled.  Angry Crab doesn't necessarily bill itself as a "New Orleans" restaurant, but the elements are there. Cajun seafood boils, po-boys, oysters (even char-grilled!), and alligator are all on the menu and when we ventured over, a whopping 4 days after they open (I'm surprised I could even wait that long) I knew exactly what I wanted: A dozen raw oysters and a pound of crawfish.  Unfortunately, after we were greeted by our cheerful waitress, we were informed "We're out of crawfish and we're out of raw oysters". Whomp whomp. So I guess they need to work out some kinks in inventory, understandable since they've been open for such a short period of time, but I honestly might not have even gone had I known that in advance.  Instead we split a dozen wings (kinda like oysters right? Except...not at all), I got a pound of snow crab (trifecta sauce, spice level 2) and Lance got the Alligator Basket.  The wings were delicious. Instead of traditional wing sauce we just got the same trifecta sauce they use for the boils and it was fantastic, no ranch or any additional dipping sauce was needed.  My crab legs were also awesome, and a HUGE portion. I wasn't exactly sure how much a "pound" would be, considering the shell-meat weight ratio, but it was more than enough for me and would probably be enough for two people to share with a couple apps and sides.  At $15/lb that day for the snow crab (less or more for other items), I thought it was a pretty decent value.  I was too busy working for my food to try any of the Alligator basket but it was devoured so I'm sure it was good too.  All-in-all, I'm looking forward to Angry Crab reversing the curse of that particular location so I can keep getting my NOLA fix without buying a $300 plane ticket (and nursing a 3-day hangover because, come on, it's New Orleans). I'll update when I can go back to get my oysters and crawfish, which I'm sure I'll find a way to do VERY soon (though I'll call ahead this time).

I'm going to use this Tokyo Joe's Yelp review platform to give everyone a lesson in Economics 101: The Time Value of Money.  The Time Value of Money essentially means that Time is Money.  We all know this, yes, but do we practice it?  A few things that are examples of people NOT taking into account the time value of money:  1. Waiting in line for an hour for a free order of $5 chicken. 2. Standing outside of Wal Mart for 4 hours on Thanksgiving to save $50 on an iPad. 3. Spending an hour cooking and cleaning up a dinner for two that would have cost $5 more per person had we just freaking gone to Tokyo Joe's.  As you may have guessed, I basically decided a long time ago that the four waking hours I have at home after working Monday-Friday are way too important to spend washing dishes, so I'm a big fan of places like Tokyo Joe's where I can get affordable, healthy dishes that relieves a little bit of the society-induced guilt I get for eating out for almost every single meal I eat.  I also love that a few of their sauces have no added sugar, which I try to avoid, and they have the "No Carb Extra Veggies" option which is delicious and fits well into the diet I am perpetually on. For some reason doing this is $1.40 or so extra. I don't really like paying extra to not eat carbs, as not eating carbs is punishment enough, but at least here I have the option.  Besides the veggie bowls, another one of my go-to items is the salmon hookipa salad, add avocado. You get a decent-size and -quality piece of salmon and a half of a sliced avocado for about $10 (half portion, including the avocado surcharge which I at least understand this time).    All in all this is a solid place that Lance and I go at probably once a week or so to get filled up quickly, cheaply, and with less guilt than most quick and cheap options (except chipotle which will always be my fast casual bae). Now please go so I don't have to worry about them shutting down anytime soon because I seriously cannot STAND doing dishes.
