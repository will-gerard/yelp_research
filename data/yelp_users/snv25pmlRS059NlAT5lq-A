So the 5$ gift card add was not honored here when we had the right products. And the lady at the desk was rude! I will be sure to notify their Corporate office Friday. We shop target all the time at least once a week, and for this to happen twice in a row!!! ??? Wtf!! Ill never come to this target location again!

Ok let me just say for a VERY thin crust pizza to start, not good at all very disappointed  with is place. We waited over a hour for our pizza and it was very bland. I from Chicago and have worked at many authentic pizzerias, so I'd like to think I have a good pizza perspective. I do not recommend  this place, and if you are from the east side or Midwest... you will not like it. I will never come here again. Paid 50$ for poor service and poor food. You would think in such a prime and up coming location, it would be outstanding.

Giving this a 2 star. Just left this location and we waited over 20 min for 2 kids pizza and a turkey sandwhich. The store was not busy and no one told us what was taking so long. When we got our food, there was not even a sorry about the wait. Very disappointed in this trip

Great taste, and one of the best Id say around here! Everyone needs to try this! Its a big bonus that the west side has something like this.  Definitely recommend this to people to try.

Good service! The food has a very earthy flavor to it. Its Vietnamese food with a kick if you want spice or not either way its delish!!. Again another hole in the wall that doesn't disappoint.
