I've been using this Avella for many years. They were formerly the Apothecary Shop and changed to Avella in the past few years. Going through fertility treatments is an expensive, unpleasant process but Avella's stellar service always makes the process a little easier. Many times I could get some of the drugs at a local pharmacy but instead prefer driving the over 20 mile distance to use Avella. They do their best to work with my insurance and save as much money as possible-which isn't too much but it's something. The staff is always very courteous and professional even when they are incredibly busy. Great specialty pharmacy. They also deliver if you plan a little bit in advance!

I'm a stay at home mom who needed an occasional sitter for our 1 year old daughter and contacted A+ Nannies based on recommendations and  for their reputation in providing reliable, experienced nannies. I was not disappointed! They do all the legwork in finding a sitter, ensuring that they are qualified and reliable. Every time we have used their sitting services, the nanny was punctual, friendly and took initiative to really get to know our daughter. The owner, Hilary Lockhart, goes above and beyond in meeting your needs as a customer and is very knowledgeable in this industry. A+ Nannies providing us with peace of mind knowing our daughter was in great hands!

We worked with Alexander previously and when our lease was up on our car it was an easy decision to work with him again. Alexander made the process of picking out, purchasing & picking up our new car a great experience. Chandler Chapman BMW provides excellent customer care and we would recommend both the dealership and Mr. Alexander to anyone in the market for a new or used car.

As a girl who loves a good blowout, I was so excited to hear about this coming to North Scottsdale. I have frequented blow dry bars in other cities and have always been beyond impressed with their ability to make hair look amazing, not the case here. I have visited Primp & Blow two times with average to poor experiences. The first time I decided to try it before hitting the town with some girlfriends. The stylist was professional and the results were alright. A really amazing blowout can last 3-5 days and after this experience it was looking pretty bad the next morning. My latest visit was to get my hair done for family pictures. I was hesitant to go but thought I would give it another shot. I have a toddler and was looking forward to some time away to get pampered instead I listened to the stylist talk about the woes of her relationship for over an hour. Not to mentioned it seemed like she had never used a round brush before and was as slow as molasses. The girl next to me came at the same time, had her hair blow-dried, curled and was out the door 20 minutes before my blow dry was finished. The stylist was very unprofessional and I couldn't wait to get out of there. When all was said and done my hair looked nice but really no different then I could have done myself, certainly not a professional blow-out. As I was driving away, I reached under the back of my hair to notice it was still damp. I couldn't believe it and by the time my pictures happened an hour later it had fallen flat because she failed to completely dry it.   I will say that I noticed a few stylist in the salon that seemed very professional and experienced but not sure I would risk the time and money to give this place another shot.

I was in a last minute pinch to find dog sitters for our two rambunctious Boxers and called Love Your Pets Too based on a referral from a friend. The owners Jimmie and Ben were very accommodating and so sweet when I spoke to them over the phone. With only a days notice, they were able to stay at our house and texted me updates throughout the weekend. We came home to very happy pups! Ben and Jimmie are caring, trustworthy people who have a tremendous love for animals. We will certainly use them again!
