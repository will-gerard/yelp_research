I like kohls. They have great customer service. And an AWESOME return policy. You can bring anything back, anytime! AND a long as you have card (&/ or kohls card) you purchased item on,  you don't even have to have your receipt!!! Also, they didn't bother me when I was in cosmetics grabbing all the lip samples for hours..yes I finally decided what I wanted.  Additionally, if ever they have coupons out, which they most always do, let me tell you, they are CRAZY GOOD!! & they'll even let you scan in ones from online or have extras at the register.  Also a major bonus are the KIND bars they keep at the register for all the starving shoppers out there--which I usually end up being one of them.  Thanks to kohls for they're hours, best return policy, & the many sales & options to choose from.

Oh man!!! Don't get me started about this place!!!! Was soooooooo GOOD!!!!! Truly authentic, family style place. (As a sidenote, Google maps took me to SW corner of intersection but actually on SE.) I got the "chicken sandwich" which comes with a delicious cheese melted to perfection between layers of tender, thinly sliced chicken breast & grilled mushrooms.  I was pretty hungry, not to mention a little 'particular' about how I like food, so I added lettuce & tomato to mine..it came right out, hot & in good timing (despite business) also could must definitely been shared with 1 or 2 other people.  The lady who was running the place was helpful in explaining the items I on the menu & her service was much appreciated.  Of course, I will most definitely be back, but next time with more people!!! Seriously,  you've got to check this place out, bring friends, family, co-workers, & it will soon be a top favorite of places to eat in Phoenix !!

First of all, if your are needing a stylist who has been cutting hair for ages & is crazy skilled at knowing what would work with you, what you are looking to accomplish as well as your particular hair type/ face shape--this is the place you need!! My mother & I have been going to My's shop for years (15+) and let me tell you, we are not easy to please when it comes to our hair!!  My really goes above & beyond to make sure you leave happy with your hair.  Not to mention the price is a FRACTION of what any salon would charge for the caliber of her services. Cannot emphasize enough how fortunate I am to have found a stylist both extremely affordable and intensely proficient in her craft--people often stop me and make comments on my hair asking what salon I go to..I live in Gilbert, and make the drive because she is that good!!!

So last Sunday I was hoping to get a quick bite to eat, & what ALWAYS sounds good? Tacos of course!  So in usual fashion, I resorted to yelp for suggestions...unfortunately in this case, I was *royally* disappointed.  And that's saying a lot for Mexican food because as far as that goes, I'm easy to please! But really, it's gotta be pretty bad to screw up enchiladas, am I right?!  From the chic with a serious attitude behind the counter, dirty tables (even though there were only two other people in the restaurant) stale, store-bought looking chips you have to pay $1 for...to waiting a good ten minutes for my order because apparently the 4 people who ordered after me were more of a priority...But I figured based on the reviews it would be worth waiting for.  Sadly, that was not under case either.  Since all the tables were dirty, I decided to take my food to go.  And being as hungry as I was, looking forward to my $7 "enchilada special" with rice and beans, it was a great let down unwrapping the plastic from the deformed Styrofoam box. What I found was watery 'beans,' enchilada slop smothered in sour cream, and something not even faintly resembling chicken (not sure if i want to know!) But really, they honestly think it's ok to *microwave* STYROFOAM??!  Well, all that to say, this place was so highly overrated, it made Taco Bell look like a five star!

Obsessed with their all fruit smoothies which you can customize to your liking. I usually get something like a mango, strawberry & peach. The $1 off on yelp is a major bonus too!!  I crave their smoothies big time, their baked good always look fantastic.  Living in Gilbert area, I definitely go out of my way to visit this shop. The ladies at the counter provide excellent device as well, always super helpful even when busy-did I mention that l LOVE LOVE THE SMOOTHIES!!! ...Would definitely try other menu options, but still hooked on the SMOOTHIES!!
