HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED: "They" say there is a first time for everything. And there is also a last time. Today was probably both times for me at the Tea Light Cafe.   After ordering our food, we were presented with the option of eating outside in 100+ Degree temperatures or waiting for someone to clean the only 4 top table open. We elected the latter of the 2 options. After patiently waiting for someone to clean the table I finally cleaned it myself. Ok. Not too bad but not what I expected.   Our food came out lightening fast!  As I took the first bite of my egg roll, I was in heaven!  It was delicious. Next, I took a bite of my beef and it was ice cold. I asked my wife how hers was and she said cold. It dawned on me that while I was putting the dirty dishes left on the table by the previous occupants, I noticed a cart with 2 pre-made lunched that were exactly like ours. Seeing this was my first time to Tea Light Cafe, I thought maybe our meals were supposed to be cold. I asked the guy that dropped them off if that was the case. He said no and that he'd be right over to fix it.   He scooped up our meals and came back a few moments later. Our meat was warm but it was as tough as shoe leather. My wife stated the obvious, they reheated our meals and presented it to us. Too bad, as that is the worst thing a restaurant can do.   I think we caught them on a bad day, as the foot traffic was nonstop.

RECOMMENDED: Harkins 101 is a great theater to take in a movie. They have a ton of screens, including their premium theater: Cine Capri. They have most new releases plus they offer cool out of the box movie events including the PHX film festival and summertime kids movies.  The concession stand is packed with junk food galore which is perfect for watching a movie. Expect the upswell from a large to an extra large for just a few cents more. One of the cool things about Harkins is that they offer a popcorn shirt which gets you a popcorn at a highly discounted price or free and an annual soda cup which can be refilled all year for $1.50.  I noticed that they offer White Castle sliders, which I thought was pretty cool even if I wouldn't eat one. Expect the concession stand to move at a snails pace, so arrive a little early.   MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PART OF HARKINS IS THE FLAVORED POPCORN SALTS!!!   The movie theater is conveniently located at the corner of Mayo and N. Scottsdale Rd one block south of the 101 @ Scottsdale. They offer a ton of parking in the shopping center.

BUYER BEWARE: I have been coming here for a very long time and today's review pains me to share. I selected the pay at car wash option and got the works for $19.95. Upon entering the wash tunnel, I was greeter by a nice guy who proceeded to attempt to upsell me on several things, which is cool.   When I paid, all was cool inside. I especially love the free bag of popcorn with a wash!  My big complaint comes from the piss poor job of a wash I received. The lack of attention to detail is apparent. The dirty floor and back seats shows me that the car was barely vacuumed. The filthy inside windshield shows me that they would rather replace the windshield then actually wash it. They left the front of the car dirty with an abundance of dead bugs. The turn signals showed the layers of dead bugs. The supervisor was put off when I asked I they were going to actually clean it off.   I've bought books of multiple washes for years and I'm seriously thinking of either going to Danny's or Tom's Thumb from now on.   I HAD MY WINDSHIELD REPLACED HERE A FEW MONTHS AGO AND THEY INSTALLED A SCRATCHED WINDSHIELD AND LEFT THE INSULATION HANGING OUT!!!  Piss poor work in my non-expert opinion!!!

NOT RECOMMENDED: this review is for the windshield  glass replacement company only!  I am losing count as to how many times I've had to come back to get my windshield mirror remounted. They replaced my windshield glass and did a poor job mounting a defective windshield (enormous scratch through the center of the 3rd visor) and left insulation bulging out the passenger side. Upon replacing the defective glass, my rear view mirror fell off days later. I've stopped in no less than 6 times and they have not fixed anything nor do they have a resolution to solve this problem.   I was promised a phone call back from Jason Williams. He never called???  I've stopped in now again and they still don't have a solution. Charles the service tech is the only one willing to help. The company has "lost" my paperwork and Jason refuses to get on the phone again this morning.   They are fast to take your money or charge insurance for a replacement but pitifully slow to correct their shoddy work.   The service rep that spoke with me Saturday came from the bathroom and his reason for not assisting me...  What for it: he ate something that upset his stomach? I cannot make this up!  Apparently today, they miraculously have a solution... A repair kit?!?!  Who knew such mystical beasts existed. I think they had it hidden with their unicorn. I've only asked them to repair their work!!!  Do yourself a favor and drive past Cobblestone's windshield partner  and go somewhere that doesn't leave the burden on their customers.  UPDATE: Jason Williams just left me a voicemail stating that they cannot locate my paperwork so I must have used a different company!  Do yourself a huge favor and allow your insurance company to resolve.  UPDATE PART II: I finally got my mirror reattached. The car wash manager found a mirror glue kit and had the service tech glue the mirror on. The entire labor was faster than watching Charles the local onsite sales guy beg his manager over the phone to make this right. FYI - Charles rocks!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: The Brake Masters in North Scottsdale is "one of the Good Guys".  They are not pushy and don't try to upsell, which is rather unique in the car repair space. They offer a free tire rotation, ac check and brake inspection with their oil change.   I like how friendly they are and how transparent they are about pricing and the time required to get the requested work accomplished.   Their location is a little out of the way but it's definitely worth it. Located directly next to the Go AZ motorcycle complex, Brake Masters is easy to get in and out of.   The lobby is fairly clean outside of the awfully loud sound pollution coming out of the tv.    This is the ONLY place I bring my car for an oil change now.

Great selection of bagels and super friendly staff. I love the fact that they don't dilute their whitefish salad with cheap fillers, like so many others do these days. They carry the Acme brand whitefish, which is my favorite and the best in my opinion. Their bagels are delicious. Their lox spread cream cheese is pretty good too!

Highly recommended: old fashion family fun!!!  If you are looking for new then this is not your place.  If you are looking for authentic, this is your place.  It took me back to my youth and I could not get enough of this place.  Good, clean family fun!

Size matters... If you are going to sell the smallest gyro, it better be amazing. Unfortunately, not only are these the SMALLEST gyros we have ever had, they are the worst too.  These gyros had maybe 2 thin and skinny slices of meat on them but where they lacked meat, they over compensated with an insane amount of sauce.   The salads that accompanied the sandwiches was nothing more than dried out, wilted lettuce with a white tomato sliver.   If this wasn't an Old Town tourist trap location that offered a full bar, hookah bar and late night service, odds are they would have gone out of business a long time ago. Don't expect any shade on their patio, as they have 1 functioning umbrella and 1 non-functioning umbrella.   The good news is we now know were not to go for good, authentic Middle Eastern cuisine.   They have a very convenient location, situated right off Scottsdale Rd directly next door to Pattie's.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:  Kazimierz World Wine Bar is one of my favorite Scottsdale hangouts.  They have an epic wine list, a full bar and their food comes from their sister restaurant next door: Cowboy Ciao.  They offer live music frequently.  The vibe inside is very appealing.  Not your typical younger Old Town crowd so common in the area.  This spot appeals to a slightly older mixed crowd (35 and up).  The bartenders don't appear to be the typical pretentious group.  They are friendly and as chill as Kazimierz is itself.  This is one of my favorite places to frequent and it is my favorite place to recommend to out of towners that are cool and 35 yrs or older.  It's one of the best kept secrets in Old Town Scottsdale.  Don't expect to find Kazimierz by their flashy signage.  In fact, there is no sign out front.  If you know where Cowboy Ciao is (Corner of Stetson & 6th) then you know where Kazimierz is.  To get there, simply face the front door of Cowboy Ciao and walk north (or to the left).  You'll see a breezeway between CC and the building next door.  Look for the stained glass, which is hiding Kazimierz.  Simply walk down the breezeway and make a left. The first door, which is unmarked, is the entrance to Kazimierz.

Recommended but far from impressed. We are Grimaldis faithful. Our visit the the Old Town Scottsdale location left us questioning everything about Grimaldis. Normally we eat at the North Scottsdale location. Knowing that all the restaurants are family owned and the fact that they brag about the fact that they have special only for Grimaldis flour and sauce & that they get fresh produce delivered daily, our pizza was pretty bland. The sauce had no flavor at all. NONE!  A can of ragu would have had zestier flavors.   I'm hoping we just happened to catch these guys on a bad day. Maybe???  Nonetheless, we will go back sometime again. We will have to try out this location one more time before striking it off our list. The DC Ranch location is our normal Grimaldis spot.   The Old Town location is great.  It's a block south of Indian School on N. Scottsdale Rd. They have a large indoor dining room with an open view of the guys tossing the dough in front of the big coal fired oven. If the weather is nice, treat yourself to the cute outdoor patio. They have several private party dining rooms at this location.   I love their flair for being an old school pizza parlor. The red and white checkered table clothes rock!  My kids got a huge kick out of their sinks with the built-in Dyson air dryer!  Cool dad. The kids love that they get a small piece of raw pizza dough to play with while awaiting our food to arrive.   Be sure to try their salads. They are really well put together and very tasty!

RECOMMENDED:  Domino's new improved pizza is much better than their previous pizza.  Everything tastes better starting with  their improved zesty crust.  Their $5.99 for 2 large 2 topping carry out pizzas are a pretty good deal.  The location is neatly tucked away in the AJ's shopping center at Pima Rd & Pinnacle Peak.   Staff is pretty nice, as they greeted me from the kitchen. I was pleasantly surprised that they are super fast to have pizzas ready for carry out.  They no longer will give you packets of parmesan cheese.  Instead they will sell you a packet of parmesan cheese.  I don't think they offer crushed red pepper packets either.  Whatever works Domino's.

This place rocks!   There's no fire or gigantic koi ponds to captivate your senses but if you're looking for fresh fish and food that will knock your socks off...  this is the best sushi.  Toyama's a quint sushi bar with an extremely cool owner/sushi chef named Mo, who aims to please!   Mo is from Japan and as authentic as the food, plus a funny guy to talk with.  It's really cool to see an owner take such pleasure and pride in his craft.  The food is awesome and shows Mo's passion for delighting his clientele.  I highly suggest not looking at the menu or the specials and ask Mo to "hook you up".  I don't think I've had the same thing twice.  I'm a new "regular" and I like it!

Greasewood Flat, you will be sorely missed! This was among my absolute favorite spots in the state of Arizona! Living just down the street, the sound of live music coming around the mountain always gave us a great feeling! It was our "go to" Sunday afternoon spot and THE place to bring out of town guests.   It is a shame that they leveled the entire property for a new housing development. Boo City of Scottsdale!

RECOMMENDED: PostalMax is a great place to use as an alternative to your home mailbox. I love the convenience of having someone readily available to sign for our frequent packages. Unlike a U.S. Post Office Box, PostalMax can sign for packages sent by FedEx and UPS.    They offer a variety of options for mailbox rentals and also ship our mail to us weekly when we are away for extended periods of time.   They ship using all the major carriers and a variety of extras.   Robert, the owner, and his staff are very friendly and a joy to do business with. I like the idea of saving money by renting long term.  The hours are not as good as some of the other places but the service more than makes up for it.   Our kids love checking the mail, as the owners dogs hang out with him and they are super friendly doggies!  I think the kids like petting the dogs even more than getting a piece of candy at each visit.  Who am I kidding?  They like the candy best ;)

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Located along the "Scottsdale waterfront" (i.e. canal) this is among one of my favorites.  This is by far one of my favorite patio locations in Scottsdale. Whether you are there on business or pleasure, it's hard to go wrong with Olive & Ivy. The wait staff is very attentive and accommodating.    The menu at Olive and Ivy is simple and straightforward.  Their small bite offerings allow a solid taste of several different flavors.  Most of the dishes appear pleasant to both the eye and the palette.  Do yourself and your stomach a huge favor...  enjoy their weekend brunch sometime sooner than later.  Seasonal warning: when I was there last week, the noise on the patio was pretty bad.  I believe they are prepping along the waterfront for the NFL Super Bowl, at least according to the waiter.  Just outside of Olive and Ivy's patio was a very loud, BEEPING front-end loader making all kinds of noise.  We hardly noticed...  I SAID, WE HARDLY NOTICED :) Regardless, I'll still go back time and time again!

RECOMMENDED: My car got sucked into the drive thru by the intergalactic tractor beam so I had to appease it by ordering a Double-Double and some well done fries!  In-N-Out is part of what makes the West Coast the West Coast. I love that they make their burgers fresh to order and only use fresh meat. The fries took a little to adjust to, since I had grown accustomed to the crap other burger joints put in their fries. Not In-N-Out... You can see them cutting up whole potatoes to make their fries.   In-N-Out is known for their "secret" menu. My advise is to ask someone in the know or simply read the comments on the listing here in Yelp for some hints and insight.   My personal favorites are the Double Double or the Triple Triple. Simply put... That's 2 patties with 2 slices of cheese or 3 patties with 3 slices of cheese!  I order mine Animal style!  Ask for this and you'll certainly never order it off the menu again.   The North Scottsdale location is easy to get to. It's always clean and the staff is impressive!  It's hard to beat In-N-Out in the fast food burger niche. Enjoy ;-)

IS THERE A WAY TO LEAVE NO STARS?  As a long time Flo's customer, today's review pains me to write and share...  Normally we order takeout and everything is perfect.  Today we made the critical mistake of eating at Flo's...  BIG MISTAKE to attempt to eat there on a Friday at lunch.  The service was abysmal to say the least.  The waitress clearly had trouble managing her tables and stayed in the weeds the entire time.  They poured 2 glasses of water for a table of 4 and even after requesting water for our 2 children, our salads were on the table and  1/2 eaten before I finally had to go ask a hostess for 2 more waters.   Our main course was on the table and we had still never received silverware for all 4 people so we finally robbed the freshly made table next too us.  I felt sorry for the elderly couple who sat down later at that table knowing they may never see silverware again!  She asked if we wanted our food to go and was only concerned with running my credit card to settle the bill.  Finally a random busboy stopped by and asked if we were interested in some togo boxes.  He kindly dropped them and an empty bag off at our table.  It really bothers me when a restaurant fails to actually box up food for the patrons and leaves boxes to do it yourself, but we will save that story for another day.  We love Flo's and will remain loyal for take out only!  EAT IN CUSTOMERS BEWARE!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: if you're looking for the best oysters in town, look no further than Pappadeaux.  I typically avoid chain restaurants like they've got the plague but... Pappadeaux is one that is certain to be a crowdpleaser.  The menu is filled with lots of Cajun fanfare. Whether you're in the mood for Crab Louie, gumbo, bisque, shrimp or crawfish étouffée, fried seafood, scallops, alligator or lobster, Pappadeaux has you covered.   Today we enjoyed a dozen Gulf oysters as a starter. Next, my wife dined on the bacon wrapped shrimp with cheese and jalapeño and I have the crawfish étouffée and shrimp.   Our server Kirk was awesome!  The one-way only access road entrance location is kinda weird if you don't know how to get to it but it is simple enough.    I'm already looking forward to returning for a few dozen oysters!

RECOMMENDED: 4 words...  Sean's Croatian Spinach Loaf!  I've eaten at the North Scottsdale location before and loved it. Being a creature of habit, I usually ordered the Wolfpack. This visit changed all of that. I ordered Sean's Croatian Spinach Loaf and it is absolutely amazing!  I tasted why it's an award winning entrée. Trust me and your taste buds can thank me later!  I liked it so much, I visited the North Scottsdale location 2 days later and ordered it again!  One thing worth pointing out is consistency runs true at both locations. The service is top notch.  The restaurant is buzzing with energy and the staff rocks.

I am so not impressed with cartel coffee. For starters the front counter help gentleman is a rude little pretentious snot.  It was beneath him to be polite and he wasn't hesitant to demonstrate that to me. After making me feel completely wrong for not ordering the correct cartel way... The icing on the cake with this gentleman was the fact that when I asked for a receipt he looked at me like I had four eyes. It turns out they only offer an email or text message receipt. I appreciate the idea of going green but sometimes a paper receipt is required.  My next encounter which was unfortunate was when my four drinks were ready... I asked if I could have the drinks marked and again this is against cartels policy. I was told that I would have to figure it out based on whether not they cups have a paper sleeve on them. That's kind of crazy since I have four different drinks.  I appreciate the idea of being a hipster joint or fashion week cool but not at the cost of customer service and customer appreciation. Maybe I'm just too darn old to order coffee in a college town. Then again, maybe Cartel should expect their employees to treat their paying customers with respect.   Next time I'll... Who am I kidding?  It'll be a month of Sunday's before there is a next time.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: this place rocks!  If you are in search of clean food without all the crap found in most of today's processed food like imitations then look no further. Whole Foods is one of my favorites, although they are pricey.    The Scottsdale location is BIG and they have a wide variety of yummy packed in! The produce section is super inviting with a ton of choices to satisfy your wildest fruit craving. Their meat department is among the best in the area. If you are a craft beer fan, look no further, as the Northside Tavern is a hidden gem deep within the WF.  But...  my favorite part of this location is the HUGE pre-made food and salad bar selection.  They have everything from your basic salad bar offerings to pizzas, burritos, a pre-made foods to the fact that they will cook any of your fresh fish selections for you!  Whatever you are looking for from soap to gluten free soy based fettuccini noodles you can bet that it is here!  Just bring your wallet or your Apple iPhone to "Whole Paycheck"

Being a good ole boy from the South, BBQ rates pretty high up the ladder for me. I've been wanting to try out this new Q joint for a while. Today was the day.   Being greeted by the yummy smell of hickory smoke was a welcome to get my experience started. My mouth instantly started watering like one of Pavlov's dogs.   The restaurant is clean and the staff seemed friendly enough.   I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, knowing this is one of the mainstays any BBQ joint worth their salt is graded on.   The meat is delicious, although I expected a little more smoke flavor. My only criticism is that the portion of meat actually on the bun was significantly less than expected. Being able to see the bottom bun due to sparse meat was not a welcome sign. Hopefully I just caught the bubba's sleeping in the portion arena.   Overall, it was a great sandwich and I will be back the next time I'm too lazy to smoke my own!  I reckon next time I'll have the ribs or some brisket.   Thanks y'all.

RECOMMENDED:  I'm so glad that I gave this place a 2nd shot.  I am happy to report that upon further review, it's even better than the 1st time.  My beef on my first visit was portion size ONLY.    Walking in, I was immediately met with the sweet mouth watering smell of hickory smoke enticing my taste buds.   Today, I elected to order 1 lb of meat as my meal, 1/2 pound pork and 1/2 pound brisket.  My wife ordered 1/2 pound smoked chicken and 1/2 pound pulled pork. We did not even come close to finishing it all!  I really enjoy the deep hickory smoke flavor of their meats.  It is delicious.  I WILL BE BACK OFTEN!  Friendly staff!

This pizza requires patience, as they have earned a great demand due to the excellent quality of their cuisine. Case in point: just waited 2.5 minutes on hold just to place my order and quoted one hour delivery time. Both "inconveniences" are justified by how yummy their pizzas are.   Warning: the less than stellar reviews do not do this place justice. I can only attest to the pizza and garlic knots. It's a delicious and solid pizza!    We have dined at Lorenzo's on numerous occasions. It's an old fashioned pizza joint with a big pizza oven and not the fast food style pizza cooked with a conveyor belt. Seeing how many take out and delivery orders they handle is extra validation to how many of my neighbors love their food.   Lorenzo's is conveniently located in the shopping center on the Northeast corner of N. Scottsdale Road and E. Pinnacle Peak Road. The shopping center had plenty of free parking.

Hidden gem this side of the border.  Lunch is very yummy. We've eaten here several times and never disappointed. They are open for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Breakfast burritos are wonderful. I recommend the chorizo burrito, although all are delicious. The entire menu is wonderful and their homemade salsas compliment the fare.  The owner is super cool and always makes people feel right at home!

True Foods is the real deal!  True Food Kitchen is a consistent winner.  They offer great, clean and healthy food without the typical healthy food vs good food trade off.  I enjoy the consistency they offer from restaurant to restaurant.    True Food Kitchen offers fresh cold pressed juice drinks, as well as some very unique "adult" version cocktails.  They refresh the menu several times throughout the year.  They do keep several of the mainstays throughout the year.    Their wait staff are always amazing and super friendly.  Easily located at the front of Biltmore on Camelback Rd.  The icing on the cake is that they offer free validated parking at their Biltmore location.

Recommended: Hanny's is the premier spot downtown for fun late night.  Hanny's occupies a very unique spot, as it used to be a men's clothing store on the corner of Adams and 1st Street.  It is an easy walk from Chase Field and Talking Stick Arena (Formerly US Airways Center).  Do yourself a favor, after leaving an event at one of the above mentioned locations, let the crowd and traffic subside and walk over to Hanny's.  Hanny's has a full bar and a delicious menu that is available late night.  The wait staff is pretty good. They are dressed like butchers and take pride in being trendy.  One of the first things people will notice upon waking into Hanny's is the music...  The DJ booth is 2 stories up peaking out over the main section.  They consistently have good house DJ's that keep the music and energy flowing.  SPOILER ALERT:  Do not read on unless you do not want to experience some of the mysteries Hanny's has in store for you!!!  Seriously.  Last chance.  Turn back now or the cat will be let out of the proverbial bag...  OK.  You were warned.  Some of the main highlights are the bathrooms and the elevator.  WHAT?  You are asking what do the elevator and the bathrooms have to do with a funky spot?  The old elevator shaft has a glass floor to step out onto a stand on. When you look up, you notice you are literally standing in an old abandoned elevator shaft. It is a fun attraction that everyone deserves to see whenever you are within the walls of Hanny's.  The bathroom...  Like the Egyptian pyramids or Stonehenge will remain a mystery until you check it out for yourself.  Directly below the DJ booth, patrons will notice a stairway going down...  below the main level, curious partygoers will find a cage home to some of the freakiest and creepy dolls ever.  No matter what I type or what you read from other Yelper's, NOTHING does it justice except your own eyes. Make sure you go watch ALONE after a few adult bevvys.  Hanny's is conveniently located at 40 N 1st Street, Phoenix, AZ on the corner of 1st Street and Adams.

Recommended: if you like crab legs AND you are willing to forgo ambiance, then this is your place. Make it a point to get their player's card and enjoy a significant savings for the meal.  All you can eat crabs is the special on Wednesday and Thursday nights.  Be sure to check their website prior to driving out to East Bumble...  One of the unique parts of eating in the Casino is there is no cell service.  This may be a pro or a con depending on your preference.   They are totally blocking cell service inside the casino.  Red Rock Buffett is a cross between a Piccadili, a shitty chow hall and a high school cafeteria. Almost everyone in here looks like they got their government check. Don't be alarmed when you are waiting in line to get in and you realize that you've inhaled a few cartons of secondary smoke!  It's all worth it (sort of) when you finally make it inside to be "greeted" by not so friendly staff members.  Makes me wonder what type of abuse they take from the not so friendly customers. I nearly got run over by a lady that looked like she was 70 years old driving a motorized scooter with a cigarette hanging from her lip and an oxygen mask attached to an oxygen tank backpack - seriously!?!?  If you are expecting anything fancy, this is not your spot.  If you want to gorge your face on quality, inexpensive all you can eat crabs and you don't mind the ambiance or lack thereof, this is your spot.  The Buffett is evolving. They have moved the crabs to its own stand alone station. The crab legs are pretty solid. Hot, steamy, and plentiful.  Do yourself a favor and wave off the server after they've stacked 2-3 clusters of legs, otherwise they will be cold long before you finish eating the serving.  I hear there are other options on the buffet but I have not had anything else and I don't foresee that changing anytime soon.  The Red Rock Buffett is located inside the Fort McDowell Casino.  This a few miles from the B-Line and Shea Rd. intersection just outside of Fountain Hills, AZ.  There is plenty of parking.

I'm so bummed...  I was expecting great things from this car wash, as it was recommended by the local Tesla Service Center. I've been a couple of times and today's visit was the straw that broke the camel's proverbial back.  This is the "recommended" car wash that Tesla sends it's clientele to...  They do a sloppy job.  Finding a decent car wash in the Valley of the Sun is far from easy.  I think I have tried all of the ones within 10-15 minutes of my home.  Unfortunately, this is not going to be my go to car wash.    The idea of every car wash being a hand wash is a major plus.  The idea of my car not going into a track and jeopardizing the rims is a major plus.  These are the 2 main reasons Tesla recommends this car wash to it's owners BUT...  seeing how sloppy their work has been for 3 washes in a row negates EVERYTHING.    When I asked for the manager on duty after the 2nd wash, he rudely apologized and asked me if I wanted it cleaned or refunded?  I chose cleaned...  funny how that was the only way to actually get my car washed.  I just took my car in the other day and everything looked fine on the surface...  The water streaks from a nasty towel on all 3 mirrors was bad.  The water streaks all over the rear window was bad.  The lack of removing SOAP from the rear of the car was pathetic.  The dirt and bugs on the front windshield and nose cone was unacceptable.  I hope that a car wash sees the deficiency in the marketplace and comes in and fills this void by providing a good car wash that is priced correctly and not trying to make its money by upselling windshield repair or a detail.    I am very disappointed in CLASSIC CAR SPA located at 22111 N Scottsdale Road.    Overall, the car wash is nicely tucked into a clean gas station and conveince store.  They have a ton of stuff inside their location.  The free wifi is a nice touch but unfortunately it doesn't reach the outside seats where most clients await their somewhat clean cars.    I would love to be dead wrong on this review but I'm not.  Buyer beware!  The location is conveniently located just north of Grawhawk and E Thompson Peak Pkwy.  My experience with management is that they are way too young and immature to be in a position dealing with the public.  Damn, I just got OLD!  If you are reading this review and you know of an alternative car wash, please feel free to share~

I hear there are other items on the menu besides the Philly Cheesesteak & the chick cheesesteak.  I'd never know...  I love this place!  These are the best Philly Cheesesteaks outside of Philly.  Good bread and authentic toppings.  The people inside are fun and good service.  This is one of my favorite places for lunch.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Once you go Mac, you don't go back! Apple offers the best customer service on the planet. Bar none.  The old adage about you getting what you pay for has never been more true than what you expect and get from Apple. If there is a product we are looking for and it turns out that Apple makes it, we always buy the Apple. It works. Almost every single time.   Pro tip: if you require tech support or assistance, be sure to use their Apple Store app to set an appointment. You'll save time and get expert assistance. They offer a warranty second to none and don't hassle you to get it corrected.   The Scottsdale Quarter location rocks. It's clean. Their staff is superior to anything else I've experienced outside of Apple.

WARNING: Disappointing. It's been years since we had Little Caesars pizza. I ordered 4 pizzas. When I was ordering they notified me that they sell a not fresh pizza for $5 and if you actually want it cooked fresh they charge you a $1 more?!?!    I specifically requested my pizzas be made fresh and when I arrived to pick up my pizzas they still handed me the pizzas that were already made.   Don't bother asking for the manager... I did and was put on hold. When the young man came back he told me there's no manager in the store?    The pizzas were good and we enjoyed them. Too bad we will not be back anytime soon due to the poor service and shady attention to detail.

Over Easy is a cool new breakfast spot. The location is cool being attached to the Ice Den. Our waiter was happy and helpful. We could not decide on a single meal so we split 2.  We enjoyed the Wolfpack and the three eggs w/ steak. The Wolfpack was delicious and the eggs were delicious. The steak was tough and chewy. We will overlook the steak and will be back frequently. The patio is ideal and the views of the McDowell Mountains are good.

RECOMMENDED: I dropped in on a whim & was "just looking".  It turns out this little store is filled with fun items galore!   Tucked away near Gold's Gym & Danny's car wash,  Fascinations has a convenient North Scottsdale location. The store is immaculate and clean and doesn't feel like a dirty see shop.   The staff member that was working was very accommodating and extremely helpful.   The funny part of the entire experience was the other customer in the store. She was wearing a "Jesup Loves Me" shirt as she came out of the dressing room with an armful of kinky clothes. Judge less and love more!

This place is so unassuming especially for Scottsdale!  We decided to pop in and give it a try...  We are thrilled that we did.  From the moment we walked in we were pleasantly surprised.  The entire staff from the hostess, waitress, sushi chef, etc. ensured that the service was excellent.  The food is delicious and the portions are very generous.  I enjoyed a nice Thai curry dish while my better half enjoyed sushi.  Unless you enjoy the glitzy Scottsdale fanfare, this place is to add to your must try and enjoy list.  We will definitely be back sooner than later and often.

The customer is NOT always right. Don't try to order your French fries the way you like it...  They'll tell you NO and let you know they only make French Fries one way!  Read it and weep people. I hate that the counter lady was so blunt about it. At least smile and tell me no next time... If there is a next time at this location.   They have an amazing burger and they know it. Too bad the unfriendly customer service will prevent me from coming back because I really, really, really like their burgers but the juice isn't always worth the squeeze.

One of the Valley's best taco and burrito shop. Not only are they all over the Valley but they are open late!  My favorites are the carnitas burrito and the beef tacos!  I hear they have other tasty eats on the menu although I've honestly never tried anything else. I'm too satisfied with my dual favorites thus far.   The salsa bar is great and the pickled veggies rock!  Go hungry!  I find that they have 'gringo' friendly service.

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! I am saddened by the lack of customer support I have received from Verizon Wireless regarding my iPhone 5.  You have replaced 6 phones since October 6th.  ALL 6 have been defective.  People cannot hear me on them or you've sent me phones with bad screens.  Today, I received phone #6 and what for it...  people cannot hear me.  Can you hear me now?  NO!!!  No one can because you mail out defective phones!  Your manager doesn't return voice mails, your social media team is powerless and your yelp guys are non-responsive!!!  AWESOME JOB!!!  Stop focusing on shareholder value and focus on customer support.

Bait and switch raw deal... Walked in at 2:55 and saw that lunch was ending at 3 pm. We specifically asked if we could still get lunch. The gentleman behind the counter pointed to the lunch menus and we started browsing and asking questions.   Just as we were about to place our order a woman came from the back and told us that now lunch was over. We would have to now order from the more expensive dinner menu.    We asked if we could still order lunch as we were offered that when we came in and she insisted no.   I was stunned. Shocked. We really were in the mood for Thai but chose to leave instead of getting bullied into buying the same food at a higher price.   Too bad. Bad service = loss of business. They seem to forget that we vote with our $$$. I've eaten here before and they have good Thai food. Not sure why we got the raw deal today.   Great hidden location at the corner of Hayden and Pinnacle Peak. Ample parking and the best gelato shop in the Valley is right next door. Save room for it!  It's worth every extra calorie loaded bite.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:  Fili B's rocks!  Open 24/7 so whenever you've got the craving that only Filiberto's can fill.   My review is rather limited, as I admit that I order the exact same menu item EVER single visit. I hear they have other delicious menu items although I'd never know.   I order the carnitas burrito and it is delicious. Starting with the fresh tortilla...  It's perfect. Warm, fresh and very tasty...  It only gets better from here. The pork is succulent and perfectly caramelized perfection. They've added fresh guacamole and pico de gallo that add an additional explosion to your impatiently waiting tastebuds. Top this off with their salsa bar and pickled carrots and you've got one of the best burritos in the Valley!  They have 8 valley locations and offer weekday specials.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: We've been to Soul Cafe now twice.  Once for dinner and most recently for a Sunday breakfast.  During our first visit, we enjoyed a nice dinner on the patio shortly after Soul cafe opened.  We had the fortunate opportunity to enjoy meeting the owner and chef Sheila.  She is a rock star!  Her food is epic and her personality is contagious!  Soul Cafe has plenty of patio space featuring 2 separate patios on 2 different sides of the establishment.  We swore we would be back and frankly, we waited far too long to return!  We recently had breakfast here last weekend.  The first thing that stood out is the glaring question, why have we not been here more often?  Soul Cafe is not only delicious but it also has a killer vibe and energy to it.  We were put on a short waitlist and passed the time briefly at the bar.  My wife ordered a Bloody Mary and it looked amazing.  Big, bold, garnished with BACON!  Hello?  Bacon belongs on a Bloody Mary and Soul Cafe flat out nailed their Bloody!  About 30 seconds after our dining party received their drinks, we were seated.  This was the first time I have been inside.  The inside is decorated very nicely and it flows.  We had a party of 8 consisting of 4 adults and 4 kids for breakfast and we were waited on quickly.  Everyone ordered a variety of entrees.  I ordered the berry and yogurt bowl.  I was not pleased with the added cantaloupe only for the reason that it is the only fruit I will not eat.  I politely sent it back and the waiter was super cool about it.  This was totally on me and I am grateful that the waiter didn't make me wrong or feel weird for this.  My wife ordered the spicy "pancakes" and they are delicious.  They are so good, after tasting them I wished that I had ordered them myself.  I don't recall what the other family enjoyed but they all raved about their breakfasts.  The kids ordered something that they enjoyed,  it kept them busy and the left full....  good sign!  We have friends that brunch at Soul Cafe regularly and they always send us happy, smiling pictures enjoying the Moscow Mules!  You cannot beat this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Bottom line, we will be back frequently!

I was NOT impressed with the typical Scottsdale douchebag doorman who kept us outside in the freezing cold even though the bar was half empty.  Once we were finally inside, we had a great time.  We met our friends at the bar and enjoyed a great evening.  Good vibe inside and decent drinks.  We will be back!

RECOMNENDED: if you haven't devoured their Mojo burrito, you are sorely missing out!  This is hands down one of the tastiest breakfast burritos this side of Earth!  It's a delightful combination of chicken chorizo, sweet potatoes, cheese and more. I am a fan. They also offer a variety of coffees and adult beverages ;)  To top it off, the staff at Mojo's are super sweet, very friendly and cool.   The atmosphere is laid back and unless someone pointed it out, you'd probably never know that you were eating at a gold course clubhouse. They have plenty of shades outside seating & have put out water bowls for your 4 legged babies!

I've been eating at the Shroom since they opened their doors in 1974.  With that being said, I also realize my expectations are high and nostalgia plays a part too.    This is a great location and I really want to see them do well but they have a long way to go in my book.  This Shroom opened on Monday BUT this place sucks!    The pizza has too much cheese on it.  Literally covered with 2 fingers deep of cheese.  You cannot taste anything else.  Server was ok.  Their beer list is awesome!  The decor and ambiance is good.  The inside is super big and nice.  I'll be back again to see if they are Shroom worthy!

YES! YES! YES!  I am so happy to have gone back to the Shroom the other day.  I was hesitant.   My first review of the Shroom here in AZ back in June 2012 was pretty bad.  2 stars.   It pained me to leave one of my all-time favorite Atlanta originals a 2 star scathing review.  The Shroom here in AZ has it dialed in.  It is as good as I remember from growing up in Atlanta.  The yummy whole wheat crust is awesome.  Baked on the stone.  My mouth is watering just typing up this review.  I have to admit that I love having a server that is passionate about something and it shows.  Our server assisted me in selecting the perfect beer for me.  Having 50 beers on tap to choose from makes selecting the perfect beer hit or miss without a aficionado.   As my man Schwarzenegger says, "I'll be back!"

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: I've been wanting to go to Rusconi's American Kitchen for a long time!  The restaurant is simply amazing. From the moment you step inside until you walk out the door, it is an experience that rocks!  My buddy and I arrived early and made our way to the end of the bar.  The bartender was friendly and not the least bit overbearing. Wanting to just talk for a few before the remainder of our party arrived, this was the ideal spot, especially with the Monday Night Football game playing silently in the background above the back wall of the bar.  Once the rest our party of 10 arrived, we were quickly seated to our table towards the back of the establishment.  Our waiter was right on time, super friendly and very attentive.  Handling a party of 10 can be daunting but not for our guy.  He shared so much useful information from appetizer selection, to specials and what the chef is known for.  Speaking of... Chef Rusconi came out of the kitchen to say hello and he too was a joy to speak with!  It is not a big question as to why this place is so good and why it can be a little tough getting in sometimes! Pro Tip: Make reservations! THE JUICE IS WORTH THE SQUEEZE!!!  The wine special was any "wine by the glass" was 1/2 price by the bottle! Which was good, as our party of 10 put a little dent in their wine stock!  They carry a good selection of wines.  We ordered a couple orders of the short ribs, a meat and cheese plate and the tomato bruschetta as appetizers to start with based on our waiter's recommendation. If it would have been polite, I'm guessing someone would have licked the plates clean...  They were that good!  I ordered the seasonal green chili stew which is a small kettle pot of green chili pork and some fresh tortillas to be made into small tacos.  There was just enough for about 4 tacos, if my memory serves me correctly.  This made for a delicious starter.  I was informed by my buddy who frequents Rusconi's that the best 3 dishes on the menu are: scallops, lamb and salmon.  He ordered the salmon and was delighted with his meal.  Even though we were offered to add the scallops to any dish for a nominal price, I elected to go with the scallops as my entree.  To say I was pleased with my selection is an understatement.  The scallops rock and I look forward to returning again sooner than later to explore more of the menu items.  Not a single member of our party was less than delighter with their meal.  Everyone ranted and raved about how good and delicious the food was.  I cannot wait to come back!  This is a must try dining experience!!!

Good solid and friendly service. The BiG Smashburger was delicious. Good comes out fresh and fast. The burger was juicy and one of the best around. The chocolate shake was sooooo good, I gave myself a brain freeze and it was worth every ounce of pain. Well played Smashburger...well played.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: This is a great hidden gem.  Teharu is not your typical North Scottsdale frilly and fuss sushi bar.  It's low key and extremely easy on your wallet.  If you are looking for fancy, this is NOT the spot that will satisfy you.  If you are looking for inexpensive sushi, this is your spot.  They utilize a conveyor belt system to deliver fresh sushi throughout the restaurant.  We were not familiar with this method and by the time we had pulled a few items off the belt and finished them, we flagged down a waiter to find out how to keep track of what we had already eaten.  It turns out that the plates are color coded with each color representing a set price. Blue = $2.00, Green = $1.50 and Yellow = $1.00  My favorite item on yesterday's visit was the Haru Popper.  Essentially, it is a jalapeño popper filled with "krab" and cream cheese.   The location is easy to get to.  Teharu is located on the north east corner of Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd at the 101 Freeway.  Parking can be sparse during lunch hours.  Enjoy.

Disappointing!  I stopped in to grab some bagels and whitefish to bring home to the family. They were out of nearly every kind of bagel so my choices were limited to 3 non-premium flavors.   When I got home and opened the bag I discovered the kicker: I ordered and paid for a  1/2 pound of whitefish but only received ¼ pound.   I tried calling the number listed here in yelp twice without an answer.   I should have read the reviews and I would have avoided this establishment. Read the reviews. I wish I had.   Their location is conveniently located on 16th Street just north of Bethany Home Rd. Staff wasn't overly friendly but they weren't rude either.

RECOMMENDED: I'm super impressed by Discount Tire!  This is my 3rd time buying tires from Discount Tire in each time is easy. I don't feel like you're trying to rip me off or take advantage of me. Every single employee has been courteous.   The stores are super clean and not like your typical tire store covered in filth. I greatly appreciate the bottle of water I'm offered at every visit.   This particular location is directly next door to their international corporate headquarters. It's easy to get to, as is located in the Greyhawk shopping center at the corner of Grayhawk Drive and Scottsdale Drive. I will happily recommend family and friends to purchase their new set of tires from Discount Tire!

Recommended: went to Evo for the Yelp Elite event. I was impressed with the decor and the staff. We grabbed an open table adjacent to the open kitchen and were welcomed by a couple of friendly people. Next, our server stopped by to take our drink orders and to get us situated. Some of the guests around us were complaining about anything and everything. The Bloody Mary bar was a little sparse with its offerings so we went to the bartender to doctor up our drinks. Jake the bartender has a crazy cool mustache and some of the brightest inked tats you've ever seen. He's a fun guy with a ton of personality.  Our waiter was awesome too!  All in all we had a good time and the food/drinks were spot on!  Some of the others at this Yelp Elite event were being super critical about everything. Turns out they were understaffed, however, we never felt it...  We ended up both ordering the pork belly quiche and it was really tasty. The portion was a little on the small side but each bite was better than the previous. I could have polished off the entire quiche, truth be told.    We later found out that the entire brunch menu was brand new and we were the first patrons to taste the new offerings. I think that was totally ballsy and I've got mad respect for the chef!  I cannot wait to go back!  The bottomless mimosas were a hit and luckily we took Uber both ways to and fro! We could not find the end of the mimosas no matter how hard we tried.   The location is solid and it's nicely tucked away from all the old town craziness but still right in the heart of the mix.   We will return!  That's a great sign!

RECOMMENDED: If you like watching live sports with an ice cold beer and a big, juicy cheeseburger, look no farther than CBCB.   Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers is an instant classic. Their handcrafted menu paired with one of the Valley's best beer selection is sure to make even the toughest critics mouth start to water.  The crowd has an electrifying energy throughout, especially on big sporting event nights.  Improving on the original North Scottsdale took some serious effort but the Old Town spot is the CBCB Flagship locale.  The wait staff and bartenders are knowledgeable and super friendly.  If you get lucky or ask, be sure to get seated in Miranda's section...  Miranda is the best!  There is adequate public parking directly behind CBCB or take an uber.  The Cheeseburgers are great and I really enjoyed the tater tots.  I'll be back sooner than later.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: I didn't know what to expect, as I had never taken hot yoga before. Would I like it? Would it be too hot? Would I feel awkward?  Would the instructors and expert class members shun the novice?  Using a free class pass, I decided to give it a go at Sumits Yoga and I'm glad I did!  I'm hooked.   I loved it! The hot yoga  was everything I expected and more. The hot is not just sheer raw heat. They add moisture to crank up the humidity too. It's the perfect combination. I loved how it gets you loose and adds to your workout.   I've been more than once now and I really enjoy it. Sumit and the instructors are super nice and very encouraging. They are friendly and extremely helpful. The fellow class participants are eager to assist and super friendly. There is not a shred of pretentiousness or arrogance!  No awkwardness. The studio is super clean and a great atmosphere!  The location is conveniently located in the big Fry's shopping center at the corner of Thompson Peak Pky and Hayden Rd a mil or so north of the 101 near Grayhawk.

RECOMMENDED: 2 words. Before I share this magical combination of yummy deliciousness go ahead and make sure you're sitting down and not driving. Ready?  SPICY GYRO!  There. I said it.   Holy schnikes. It feels good just saying it. I better be careful because my mouth is watering profusely just recalling this for you here and now.   They take regular gyro meat and throw it in the grill with Sriracha sauce. The end results is perfectly crispy and spicy gyro meat. They make the rest of the gyro exactly like any other gyro. Lots of freshness, including veggies and tzatziki sauce. The pita was perfect.   Everyone who worked there was extremely nice and friendly. They are conveniently located right off Camelback and have ample parking.   As Arnold Schwarzenegger said, "I'll be back" and I will be ordering the spicy gyro. Bam!!!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: I love this place!  Not only do they have the best upscale gourmet Chinese food in North Scottsdale, they have a super friendly staff and an opulent new location.   I had the pleasure of dining at Jade Palace last night and I was blown away. I've been to the new location before but it was only to pickup a to-go order I called in. Last night I got to enjoy the new location in all its glory and if is gorgeous.   We sat at the bar and even though there was a decent crowd, the service was among the most attentive I've experienced in a long time.  The manager and/or owner, Devlin personally greeted us with a hand shake and a giant smile.  He is an excellent host and his staff is super friendly, as well as knowledgable.   The food was incredible. I enjoyed one of the finest prepared filets of my life. It was cast iron skillet seared and out of this world. Yes. Steak in a Chinese restaurant!!!  Do yourself and your palate a flavor and trust me here. Order the filet! Medium Rare. I'm not even sure if it's on the menu. Ask for it.   Thank me later!  We also had an egg roll specially prepared extra spicy. It was delicious.   It's no wonder why this is the local go to place for gourmet Chinese food!

RECOMMEND: we have heard how much fun The Living Room is, so we decided to pop in and see for ourselves. They remodeled the inside and it now looks and feels nothing like the previous wine bar.   The vibe and energy are great. This type of spot is welcomed up north and they should be very successful here.   The staff is friendly, especially Steven the manager. Cool guy. We grabbed a couple of seats at the bar. I love how they have seats "behind the bar".    The drinks are good and not a cup full of ice. I decided to order something to nosh on and selected the meat and cheese plate. Nice selection of meat and cheeses to choose from.   We especially liked the fact that they were playing the UFC fight on TV.   We will be back!

RECOMMENDED: Smashburger rocks!  The food is made fresh and to order. The staff is super friendly. It's no surprise that this chain is expanding fast.  My personal favorite is the Truffle Mushroom Swiss Big Smash!  The organic arugula adds the perfect flavor. If I've been extra good, I'm happy to reward myself with either their smash fries or a butterfinger hand spun milkshake.

RECOMMENDED - North Scottsdale finally has a legit taco and burritos shop!    Located conveniently off Pima Road / 101 access road next to Dunkin Donuts just across from Walmart, Señor Tacos rocks!  There is plenty of parking in a private lot directly out front, as well as an abundance of parking overflow across the street in the Walmart parking lot.   Immediately upon walking in the door, guests are greeted with a spotless restaurant and friendly smiling faces of the staff. Everyone is very warm and cordial.   The menu looks delicious and if my breakfast is any indication as to the rest of the offerings, this place will be well received by the locals.   SMART PHONE users are notoriously looking for power outlets to top off our battery hungry devices.  Well, the cool folks at Señor Tacos have  hooked us up big time. Each booth has a power outlet readily available to power up, which includes a standard plug in plus dual USB ports!    Ok, I digress...  Back to the food!  It's delicious. I enjoyed a custom designed breakfast burrito. It was super yummy. They have several flavors at the salsa bar to choose from. In addition, they have pickled jalapeños and carrots to add some extra heat to your taste buds.   We will be back OFTEN!

Tesla has further upped the automotive game yet again. The Tesla Service and Delivery Center took my entire idea of a new car delivery to an entirely new level. I believe I'm 'fairly' qualified to share this, as I grew up around the car business beginning at a very young age.  I've easily witnessed thousands of cars being delivered to their new owners, with countless being high-end Cadillacs and Lexus vehicles.  Tesla takes this experience to an entirely new level.  The delivery specialist invested over an hour going over every feature of my new electric vehicle. She showed me how to set the car up exactly how I'd get maximum joy out of it. To say that I was impressed is an understatement of gigantic proportions.   The service and delivery center is super clean and stocked with all kinds of goodies for new owners. It is conveniently located on Hayden Rd just past Raintree Rd in the Scottsdale Airpark.

NOT RECOMMENDED: Portillo's is the "famous Chicago" hot dog place and sorry to say but it sucked! Awful is putting it nicely. To say we are disappointed is a gross understatement. CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE DRIVE THRU!!!  I've heard so many great things about this place, especially from Chicagoans...  I don't get it?  How a hotdog establishment  messes up a hot dog is beyond me.  The hotdog was drenched in ranch and ketchup. It had so much liquid on it our kid refused to hold it until we poured ¾ off.   My wife order a grilled tuna sandwich and what she got was a DRY chicken sandwich?!??  Reminds me of Joe Pesci's character in the "Lethal Weapon" movies saying, "they'll f@€£ you in the drive through!"  They did.   My hotdog was a sad shriveled up sight. The bun was wet and chewy?  Must be a Chicago thing, as I tend to enjoy my bread not wet?!?!  I want my $20 and wasted time back from this place.  I'll avoid this place moving forward.

Highly recommended: from the moment we arrived on the property we were impressed. The valet offered to plug my Tesla into their Tesla Destination Charger, which is a big deal to me!  Ummmm....  Yes. Please. And. Thank. You. The valets were super nice and very cool guys.   Next, we joined some out of town friend's that were guests in the hotel for lunch. The inside was not too loud and our friends selected inside...  We were quickly seated at a nice spacious table. The waiter greeted us warmly and quickly began to take good care of our party.  The decor is clean, light and very tasteful. They have a nice glassed in wood fired cooking area for patrons to watch.   The manager was a familiar face to our friend and they chatted. It turns out he is someone that has provided great service in years past. He was super nice and stopped by frequently to chit chat and check on us.   The kids ordered off the children's menu...  1 cheese pizza and 1 macaroni and cheese. I always fear that it is crappy store box Mac and cheese and cardboard crusted pizza. Not the case. Their pizza looks like authentic pizza from Italy!  If you know what I'm talking about then you know what I'm talking about. There is a HUGE difference!  The Mac and cheese looked hand crafted and amazing without the Kraft looking orange glow!  The menu really features 1 main signature sandwich...  Bacon Brisket Cheeseburger. It is boxed off on the menu and for good reason!  3 of the 4 adults ordered their signature Bacon Brisket Cheeseburger....  It was everything we expected and much more!  I tried to order medium rare and was told by the waiter that they can only go medium or more done. Admittedly, I was a little apprehensive to order it this way as that typically means dry and tasteless as shoe leather. Not the case. The burger is definitely juicy and a great combination of flavored!!!!   The only negative of our meal is that all 3 of the burger eaters order crispy potatoes and they were far from crispy. It's pretty common with restaurants to undercook potatoes even when ordered well done or crispy.   The location works. Located on McCormick Ranch between Scottsdale Rd and Hayden Rd. They offer complimentary valet and for Tesla owners having a Tesla Destination Charger is icing on the cake. We will be back!

Let the good times roll...  This was a super fun event.  We entered right next to Olive & Ivy.  We heard live music somewhere in the background.  After passing the usual ID & security checkpoint, we picked up our plastic glasses filled with 15 drink tickets.  We were hungry and ready to attack the adult bevy's...   Starting off, we were instantly met by the best pizza at the event:  FABIO'S ON FIRE!  This is some of the best pizza this side of Italy!  We tried the other pizza vendors but they did not compare to FABIO's!  Unfortunately, the only downside of Fabio's pizza is it is a private event driven business.  Fabio is super nice and it shows that he loves what he does for a living!  He is the business.  Sidetone: his Italian only speaking Momma was helping out and she is a doll.
