This more so goes for ALL corporate movie theaters...  Do the major film companies still question why people download movies? How about the $7 minimum to get in? Way overpriced, extreme unhealthy food choices? Or sitting through 20-30 mins of ADS?  $30-40 just to be marketed at. Sad days for the movie theater business.

My parents originally brought me to Nando's and I started to like it more and more with each visit. I turned vegetarian about 14 months ago and was pleased that I could still eat here with my parents when I came to visit them. Chips are thinly crisp and the salsa tastes very fresh. They guacamole taco, as simple as it is, is very very tasty. Their black beans are also delicious. I've also had the vegetable tacos with grilled veggies, the potato jack taco, which is like mashed potatoes with spicy jack cheese, and the enchiladas. All great vegetarian options. Prices are good and servings are large. The coconut margarita is also worth mentioning.

I've been going to Manuel's with my family for years. They have very good chips and salsa, it's definitely their strong point. Unfortunately they no longer carry black beans and their refried beans contain lard. As a vegetarian, I cannot eat here any longer unless I want just chips and salsa or a cheese crisp.  Sad, sad day :'(

Great thin pizza with fresh mozz and plenty of toppings. The kalamata olives were a bit too salty for me. Good caprese salad and large 'small' salads. The small pizza is definitely not small either. Oh all you east-coasters and your moving to AZ gig.

Ridiculous amounts of bottled beers from all over, especially rare for AZ. I can't believe they had some brews that I can't find in SF or Oakland, geez. Not to mention a lot cheaper! Must be some CA distributing issue. I haven't tried their house beers on tap, sorry but with all those bottles how could I. Atmosphere leaves a ton to be desired, they could make the space awesome (like beer revolution in Oakland). Honestly I don't get the people who come here but I'll give them credit for drinking good beer. Seriously though, why so slutty/messy looking? Did they just come from the river? A little too 'bro/ho' for my style.

Really good beer and beer selection. My favorite beers include their Sunbru and the Arizona Peach. The seasonal Hopsquatch is pretty intense and the Pumpkin Porter is amazing. Their food is pretty good too. I am a fan of their soft pretzels, side salads, the vegetarian burger and sandwich, and their beer battered fries! The best time to come is during happy hour to get cheaper pitchers. Downside to Four Peaks has to be the crowd, tons of college bro's and ho's, so to speak, and lots of sports on the flat screens. We sit outside which is nice since they have heaters for chilly nights. Service can be slower on busy nights. They used to have bike parking but had it removed, they should put the bike rack back in.

Excellent happy hour! Great selection of vegetarian items! I recommend the Krisp Greens roll, it has lettuce along with asparagus, avocado and carrot. They top it with a vinaigrette that makes the roll taste like salad sushi. It's light and delicious. I was also impressed with the amount of avocado they put in my roll, no skimping on the fillings!   Cheap, yummy vegetarian sushi!

I used to come here about once a week for their amazing vegetarian sandwiches. My favorite is the griefo with pepper jack cheese, hemp cream cheese, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce, black olives, onions, mushrooms, cucumbers, and tomatoes. The hemp cream cheese is to DIE for seriously! I also enjoy the humbolt, which is very similar, and the majic mushroom with sliced portabella mushrooms, teriyaki glaze, green bell peppers, pineapple and pepper jack cheese. The 8inch is soo big but makes a great and filling lunch. You can't beat the prices either. Get the garlic herb bread, it is the best. The only thing I do not like about this place is that the whole "marijuana" theme can get old and annoying. This location can also get really really busy and the sandwiches take time to make. Staff is usually pretty friendly and social though. One last thing is that if you eat there or have to wait for a while your clothes will smell like food :/

I've been eating at Oregano's for as long as I can remember. It's definitely a staple of amazing locally owned AZ food. The guacatony is the best thing on the menu, a thin thin thin pizza crust with garlic, onions and herbs served with a huge pile of italian-inspired guacamole. I order this baby every time I come here. Other awesome thing about Oregano's is the beer selection and prices. Pitcher of Fat Tire for only $12? Sounds good to me! I am a big fan of their salads, when I used to eat meat their antipasto was amazing. Pizza is great great great. Thin and large! I like eating my pizza in square and mini-triangle end pieces. I always enjoy my meal at Oregano's. Some gripes include long waits, as the restaurants are rather small, and sometimes less than awesome service, but only sometimes. Oregano's is always a great spot to meet up for drinks and excellent food. I heard they are expanding the chain to other states, here's hoping SF gets one! I miss you Oregano's!!!

I really really love Green's menu. Just because you are vegan/veg it doesn't mean you have to eat healthy boring food all the time. My favs include their buffalo 'chicken' sandwich, apricot miso noodle bowl and 'crab' puffs. I wish I had their recipe for the fake chicken, it is aaaamzing. Servings are large on the sandwiches and slightly smaller on the noodle bowls. Their iced tea is also really good not surprisingly. The food here has been consistently good and it is definitely my spot to hit up when I am in the valley. I really would like to try the 'wings' as well as other sandwiches, I guess I need to visit AZ more.

I'm shocked I forgot to write a review on this place. Excellent, innovative mexican food. The margaritas are amazing and there are so many to chose from! Wonderful salsa's, crispy chips; the total package. Tia Rosa's had become a staple when I lived in AZ, I'd go with my parents, my friends, anyone. Vegetarians can rely on their black beans and most waiters will let you customize your order (I've had black bean tacos before, delish!). This is fresh, smokey and smart mexican food, something new from all those chains. Beware the large parties with several kids, is it located in Mesa after all.

One of the largest selections of gelato I've ever seen. This place is always happening and I love that its open late. I've seen many couples here, seems like a post-date place. Beware the crowds and try as much as you can. I hate that I was not often in this area considering their gelato is so damn mouth watering. My staple is always the pistachio.

Lackluster, flavorless breakfast. Do not go out of your way to come here. I was shocked at how many people were waiting to eat here. I ordered the poached eggs with toast and potatoes. They overcooked the eggs; a place with the word EGG in the title should be able to properly poach an egg. The potatoes were very basic and sad. The bacon my dad ordered was fatty and kinda undercooked. The big killer is that the prices were more expensive than a diner yet the quality of the food was the same.

Honestly this place was not that good. They had lots of flavors but many tasted way fake. The pistachio was just awful! Like a box of Jello pudding! The texture of the gelato was off for me, it was almost too creamy, like eating marshmallow fluff or something. Reminded me of Cold Stone's crappy powdered mix.  Go elsewhere -_-

I forgot how much I love this place and miss it. Super tiny space, super filling delicious pasties. The faux-chicken they use (quorn) is incredible and very realistic. My fav pasty is the balsamic portobello, the dessert pasties are also tasty, granted you have room. Only downside is the size and wait time.

Very nice 1 screen theatre showing independent movies. The place is clean, friendly and rarely crowded; it's a great place to catch an afternoon showing. I am very glad they still offer student pricing, $7 for a movie is very reasonable. Hope this theatre never leaves Mill.

I've been to Sauce several times and am always satisfied. I absolutely love the mozzarella, tomato and basil chopped salad. It is always so fresh and delicious. Perhaps I am just simple but their cheese pizza with mozzarella, fontina and basil is my favorite. Their crust is super thin and crunchy and the cheese is melty, salty and delicious. This isn't your normal cheese pizza, the slices melt in your mouth. I don't eat meat but my parents love their sausage pizza and the chicken noodle soup. The iced tea is decent and I enjoy that I can get a bottle of Fat Tire. Staff, although high school aged, are accommodating and friendly.

Beautiful outdoor cafe where I am finally okay with going somewhere filled with families and aren't bothered. Seriously though, PHX area is overflowing at the brim with families out to eat everywhere so it was awesome to find a delicious, fresh, local breakfast option where I wouldn't lose my mind over all the screaming children. While MGC does cater to families each table feels secluded and you can take in the nature and beauty of the farm, not to mention eat and chat in peace. Another reason for picking MGC is their use of local sustainable ingredients. As a vegetarian I think its really important to support local farmers so I am happy to see this trend picking up in AZ. I enjoyed the white truffle egg skillet with local veggies, it was phenomenal. Being veg I can sometimes get shafted by just eggs and toast dishes or the occasional bland omlette but this dish was so flavorful and full of deliciously chopped veggies (I know I saw some potatoes, cauliflower, bell pepper and green onion to name a few). I would considering bumping my fav breakfast dish 'eggs florentine' down a notch for this skillet.

I used to come here for lunch since their lunch special is such a good deal. I enjoy the variety of tofu dishes. The tempura was decent and the peanut sauce it came with was delicious, like honey and peanuts or something? I prefer the tofu dishes with flat noodles, spicy and with lots of veggies. The thai iced tea is also nice. I have not been there in a good while, last time I went I had the tofu pad thai and I could not eat it. It tasted like the smell of a wet dog. I am pretty sure it had fish sauce in it (no-no for vegetarian!) and yeah it made me gag. I wanted to give Lemongrass 3 stars but since moving to a neighborhood with amazing thai food I no longer feel theirs was up to par, thus meh, I've experienced better.

Love love love their bagels! Sesame and whole wheat are the best for sure! The veggie and veggie lite cream cheese are amazing! Very flavorful with slices of green onions and carrots, it's my favorite on top the sesame bagel. The blueberry cream cheese is also a treat, it tastes freshly made and not fake. Bagels are large and the perfect texture of chewy and crunchy (when toasted!). Deli is very fast so picking up a bagel takes only minutes. I've eaten here for breakfast as well and they have a nice selection of goodies. Their pickles are also top notch. Mmm I often miss Chompies!

I just love Sprouts and their vegetarian and bulk items. They have lots of natural body products and loose spices and herbs, something I rarely see at other natural food stores. This location is definitely still 'Mesa' in that no one uses recycled bags, the majority of shoppers are older and rarely anyone I've seen shopping here is vegetarian. Sprouts in Mesa, in my opinion, isn't really out there to replace corporate shopping centers; it's for speciality items, organic produce and bulk items.

I got to say this is probably the most accurate 3 star overall rating I've seen on Yelp in some time. I'm proud of you Phoenicians! This place was simply meh, especially given the huge amount of delicious mexican food places in AZ where you can get a kick ass margarita for a whole lot less than $10. We ordered a couple drinks and were disappointed with all of them; consensus was that they were all too sweet and not enough tequila, the sangria tasted like juice for peets sake. The chips are a nice thicker version however the salsa is thin and flavorless. Roast those tomatoes or something, throw in some heat! Their guacamole, although a decent flavor profile, needed a lot more lime and was super blended to the texture of those nasty avocado 'dips' you find next to french onion and ranch plastic containers. We all ordered tacos of various types for dinner, I had the roasted veggie ones with a hard shell. Man these were no good. The veggies were really oily from their saute and were used sparingly; the bottom of the tacos was cabbage. Honestly, the only good thing I ate tonight was the black beans, abet a bit salty. I will say our server was very friendly however the food just don't hold water to the prices. Try Tia Rosas in Mesa for some excellent mexican food and margaritas worth their $8 and more in tequila.

Happy hour is where it's at. Their margaritas are pretty damn awesome, super fresh with only 3 ingredients. None of that sugary neon green mix to be found here, only fresh lime juice and 100% blanco agave tequila. Even not on HH $6.50 is a really good price. Guacamole is also good, perfect texture, nice portion and limey. Salsas are fresh and flavorful, the pico tastes like it was just picked from the garden. While the crowd isn't for me the price and freshness draws you in. I like how the wash stations are outside of the bathrooms, very hip but approachable design going on here.

This native-AZn now Portlander gives Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co a thumbs up! It reminds me of some of the Portland breweries but back in my hometown. The beer selection was great, I was able to find something for my dad who normally kicks back bad beer, and something special for me, the beer connoisseur. The sour wheat with grapefruit was impressive and the IPA was a citrus hop bomb. These guys know what they're doing. The food was also very good, I am happy to see so many vegetarian options! I went with the veggie burger, which came on a delicious pretzel bun and amazing house-made beer thousand island sauce. The burger came with a side of house-made chips, so thinly sliced you could see through them, seasoned with sea salt and rosemary; divine. Service was friendly and prompt, prices were great, decor was fun, you dont even feel like you're in a shopping center. Will come again next time I'm visiting home.
