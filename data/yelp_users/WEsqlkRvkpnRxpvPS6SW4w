used to be a daily lunch spot when I didn't want to deal with the chaos inside ajs just for a salad. I've never once disliked anything. the service is quick and quiet. 99% of the time it's busy but the ticket time is super quick so tables are turned in no time. idk wtf is going on with those little peanut cookies they give opposed to a fortune cookie but I could eat a million of them.

if you like food in your mouth you have to eat here regularly. late night drinks... brilliant service... I fucking hate seafood but I'll eat anything that spent it's life swimming in saltwater as long as it's prepared in the kitchen at salt cellar. #shrimptoast

okay so... had a 45 minutes wait, which was to be expected on a Sunday, but unnecessary considering only half of the dining room and half of the patio was open. I have no idea what all the fuss over the margs is about, ours was left full on the table when we closed our tab. the food was actually good... but not good enough to deal with the terrible service. our server was clearly miserable from the very beginning. her adorable little rainbow rowed pens in her apron gave me a positive initial impression, until she opened her mouth. my husband was severed the wrong dish, he holds an executive position in food and beverage and isn't one to "complain"... luckily the food runner realized and brought him out something else. the wrong dish. again. we didn't see our server for 25 minutes after the food was dropped. we waited, finished, in search of the check so we could gtfo. I approached a manager and asked him for help, he asked me if I had lost something to which I replied yeah, my server. he giggled and walked off. while walking out I caught a glimpse of the kitchen and I'm SO glad I didn't catch it prior to eating because it would have been a struggle. the turtles in the pond were super cute though. for whatever that's worth. ownership change? management turnover? whatever happened it definitely wasn't for the better.

the server has no idea what alcohol they had available..... and the fact that the pretentious bar tender didn't know how to make a proper Manhattan was laughable. the sushi itself was sub par considering all the hype. definitely not returning unless I'm forced to. bleh.

fresh fishies. super friendly, quick service. PERFECT iced green tea. this place was such a great find. I love love love a long running "hole in the wall" sushi spot. a million compliments to the chef. tip - always check the blackboard.

this place makes me a whole new level of happy. the lines move crazy fast and the people that work here are so strung out of caffeine you can't help but to smile at them. chocolate almond milk and whip stix for my midgets is a definite bonus.
