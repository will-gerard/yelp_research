Mediocre at best. Food was ok but nothing special. Had the Carne Asada, it was over cooked with a wilted green onion draped over it. Soups were ok I had the Abondogas and my husband had the chicken tortilla , we've had better at local Mexican places. All in all not impressed. Better places around for a great Mexican meal.

Great selection of sushi on the conveyor belt. Very fresh made and ingredients are crisp and tasty. Nice fun spot for lunch. Tables available or sit at the conveyor belt sushi bar. Huge menu also available with bento boxes, soups and more. Will return and try the menu items for dinner soon. Yay I found a new sushi spot that doesn't break my bank account!

Great place to go if you like a fun n relaxed atmosphere. Great way to try sushi, fresh, inexpensive and fun to choose off the conveyor belt. I've had the menu entrees and they are great too! Service is great, very family friendly!

Excellent! Worth the price of the meals. Try the lobster Mac and cheese, but be prepared it's HUGE and delicious!! I had Spicy seafood pasta and hubby had the gumbo. Huge portions, excellently prepared. You will not be disappointed. It is a lot more high end than Angry Crab (more like a restaurant vibe than a true crab shack) So if you don't want to get dirty eating your seafood stop by this place and enjoy without the bib and extra napkins!

Wonderful healthy menu choices. Great for Breakfast, lunch, dinner or even just snacking! Clean and welcoming. Very courteous staff. I would definitely go again and try more off their menu. I had one of the Fruit and Granola Bowls, and it was delish. Met a friend and we chatted and enjoyed our breakfast, with out any issues with it being noisy or too crowded. Love this spot for a great meal.

Got take out and it was fabulous. Pho was amazing, I had the traditional with meat and meat balls. Also had the pork and shrimp spring rolls. They were also great. Next time I will stay in the restaurant to eat, as it was super clean and had a very friendly staff when I went to pick up my food

After a seating debacle with being sent outside and then asked by management to go back in and wait which we didn't, our server Jay was awesome! The food was amazing! Had the Diablo burger and the onion rings PRIMO! Highly recommended if u can handle the ding a kings handling the seating. Waited 45 min I know on weekends it's a 2 hr wait but totally worth it.

Horrible, high priced and no customer service. Went in with a party of 4 ordered 2 steaks n 2 seafood dinners. All  4 dinners were under cooked, scallops were quarter sized n raw inside, halibut was the size of a post it note n raw in center. Baked potatoes were so cold when cut into the butter didn't melt. Steaks were riddled with veins n grit. When we sent each meal back they re fired the seafood, replaced the steak and potatoes with new and it was still terrible. Bill was over 200.00 and they didn't even offer a comp. desert for all the problems. Save your money and your time and go somewhere else
