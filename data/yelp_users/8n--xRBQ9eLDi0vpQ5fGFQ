Rock the Casbah! Rock the Casbah!   A group of us went to the Casbah for a girls' (and one guy) lunch.  It has been ages since I've been to the Casbah, and since I live clear across the country, I was looking forward to going back.    All of us enjoyed our meals -- many ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Chopped Salad or the Wild Mushroom and Goat Cheese Omelet.  Both were nice portions. I was fixated on the Orecchiette Pasta, grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Capriole goat cheese, sage cream, and it was a home run!  (I wasn't watching calories that day!)    Service was excellent . . . surprisingly so, especially with a table of eleven, a bunch of "Sallies" and one "Harry" if you know what I mean.

I've been going to Tessaro's for years. Every trip back to the 'Burgh wouldn't be complete without a lunch or dinner there. It's my go-to place for meeting friends for a meal when we want something tried and true with no froufrou. And I am never disappointed.   I have heard grumblings for the past couple of years that Tessaro's partially cooks their burgers throughout the day and then finishes cooking them "to order" so I asked the waitress if I could have a fresh patty, not pre-cooked. She didn't seem bothered by my request. And honestly, I don't know if I would be able to tell the difference. That being said, it still was the best tasting perfectly cooked burger I have had in a long, long time. With all the new specialty burger joints popping up across the country, I still dare any one of them to stand off side by side with Tessaro's. Our usual picks are the Deli and the Bacon-Blue Cheeseburger, but you can pick any burger on the menu and be satisfied, and then some. I also love their home fries. Yummy! The marinated gourmet chicken sandwich is also a winner if you aren't into red meat!   One of my other favorites at Tessaro's which I have to admit I haven't had in eons since we haven't made it there for lunch recently is the tuna melt on rye. It has been on the menu forever. If you want one, you have to go for lunch as even though its on the lunch menu, they refuse to make it at dinner :(   The atmosphere here is strictly neighborhood bar/restaurant. Nothing fancy. I am sometimes put off by the way they offer seating (first-come, first-serve) and they will try to cram four people at a table that is meant for only three. If they are not scrambling for tables to seat people waiting, I'd ask for another less cramped table and wait; but on a crowded night, take the first thing available or you could be waiting a long, long time.

It has to be at least 25 years since I ate at Pamela's. It was one of my mother's favorite places to grab a quick bite. We met a dear friend on Saturday midday for brunch/lunch, and I ask myself, why did I wait so long to go back, after a multitude of trips back to the "Burgh" throughout the years?   I had an omelet -- cooked to perfection. I am a picky omelet eater. My eggs have to be cooked just so . . . and so they were! Truly a rarity. The accompanying potatoes were heavenly. My husband loved his corned beef and hash with eggs and potatoes. The short stack of pancakes that our friend ordered was huge . . . and after one bite, I was in Seventh Heaven. Oh, how I wish I could make pancakes just like that! The thin pancakes, almost crepe-like, with their crispy outer edges are divine.   This location begs for an aesthetic makeover . . . looks like the same furniture as 25 years ago, but what it lacks there, it makes up for in the yummy food. Service was quick but unremarkable.   Next time we're back in town, we'll definitely stop by for breakfast -- early so we don't have to wait!

Harsh to say, but I hate arenas. The only time I go is to see s concert, show or special event as I'm not an arena-type sports fan. Last night's event was Cirque du Soleil's Michael Jackson-The Immortal Tour. I have to say as far as arenas go, the US Airways Center is pretty amazing.  Entering and exiting are easy-peasy. It didn't feel overly crowded and parking was plentiful in outdoor lots or the adjacent indoor multi-story connected building.    There's a Starbucks on site, which was like heaven to me . . . I wanted a nice hot tea to savor through the show, There are other well-known food concessions throughout the arena, as well as some fairly comfortable seating areas to pass the time until the powers that be allow you to go to your seat.  Since we were sitting in Section 102, first row, we were in the makeshift seats (the same as they put on the floor, foldables with no real back support.  This was probably the only negative for me as after about an hour, my lower back was killing me (and I still feel it this morning!).  But . . . the seats were wonderful for viewing the show.  Couldn't have been better.    Sound quality was what you'd expect in an arena not built specifically for music, so I didn't have high expectations.   I have to say that I am very impressed by the US Airways Center and all the "nightmare" worries that I had about entering the building, exiting the building, finding something I wanted to drink, and of course, parking, were something I didn't have to be anxious about at all!  Bravo!

Early on a hot Saturday morning, we headed to Baker Nursery to find new plants for our landscaping adventure. What a lovely nursery! It was well organized with plenty of shade so you didn't have to wander the aisles with the sun blazing down. All the plants looked so healthy and beautiful. My husband and I are both pretty uneducated when it comes to plants. We had so many questions, and there was always someone there to tell us about the plant, what kind of soil, sunlight and water it needed, etc. I wanted a particular cactus that our neighbors have in the front of their house, but I didn't know it's name, so we played a kind of Pictionary meets Pantomime in describing it.  It took about 10 seconds for the gentleman to understand what I was talking about, pointed us in the right direction and picked the healthiest of the bunch. We loved the personal attention, and we were grateful to all the people who helped schlep the plants up to the front for us and load them in our vehicle using plastic to make sure the dirt didn't dirty the car.  Two weeks later and all our plants are thriving! Whether you're a seasoned gardener or newbie to the plant world, your time won't be wasted at Baker Nursery, and you'll get the best of the best in terms of plants and service!

All car wash spots love to up sell . . . and we got the chip in the window one yesterday, but I have to say, they didn't high pressure sell us. They gave us information we didn't know, and we ended up using their service for the windshield not just for the car we brought in, but also the one at home! We were totally amazed at how great my husband's windshield looked after they cleaned and filled a nasty chip.   The wash was great as well.  No streaks, no water drops left behind . . . We bought a package of four top of the line washes from an on-line discounter. Not knowing what to expect of the quality of work, I shuddered when my husband bought multiples, but we were very pleased with the wash both inside and out.  The service people were so polite, from Sean who handled our windshields, to Jason, the manager, who checked out the small details before handing my husband the keys.  I actually don't think the up sells are so high pressure . . . dine out and servers always push appetizers, drinks, desserts . . . this isn't any different.

If I can avoid going into a Verizon store, I will, but the iPhone 4s was being released on October 14, and I couldn't wait. I called the Scottsdale Promenade store at 8:05 am and they didn't even answer the phone, so I called the Desert Ridge location. They picked up on the second ring. They assured me if I came in the morning, I would get a phone, but they couldn't promise one in the afternoon.  Since I was driving down towards Scottsdale to get on the 101, I drove by the Promenade. The line was at least 40 deep outside the store, so I headed over to Desert Ridge -- one person in line! They had employees outside handing out info sheets and forms to get you started. They were so upbeat and friendly. Really, was I at a Verizon store?  When I got inside (they were letting in small groups at a time as people were leaving), they had another employee directing us to the new phone test area, where we could ask additional questions before being turned over to the sales rep. (And I had a lot of questions, since this is my first iPhone).  Billy, my sales rep, was efficient and really patient with me. It was a pretty easy and quick process until we realized the keyboard on the phone didn't work. There was a process he had to go through to undo all the work he had done and then get me another phone. I am grateful I tried to use everything before I left the store. It just made my visit a little longer, but when I left, I felt confident that I could at least do the basics on my new phone.  So happy with my new phone . . . total shock and awe with such a wonderful experience at the Verizon store. This will be my store of choice from now on!

My hubby and I have been fans of Roy's since our first time at the flagship location on Oahu . . . and we've watched him expand to the mainland. Our experience with the mainland Roy's have been hit and miss, but the Marriott Desert Ridge location pretty much knocks it out of the park! We went at the tail end of Arizona Restaurant Week. We really liked the menu options for this special week, and the warm chocolate souffle cake is always out of this world . . . If that was the only thing that tasted good, then we would feel we got our money's worth . . . but we didn't have to worry about it because everything was perfect from beginning to end.  We had an adorable server who had a great personality and excellent people skills. She was unassuming and let us linger between courses. As I am a stickler about food coming out too soon after just finishing one course, this was just perfect! And so relaxing. The ambiance on the patio, which is where we chose to sit, almost felt as if we were on one of the islands, not in the middle of the desert . . . with the tiki torches lit and the sound of the babbling water features throughout the resort, it came pretty close . . . it was just missing the trade winds.  The resort had a band playing as well . . . they were pretty good, a few ups and downs. I would have loved if the music was a little more subtle than the pop-jazz mix they were playing . . . oh, but I have digressed.   My hubby and his daughter chose the restaurant week menu. Hubby had the Grilled Szechuan Spiced Pork Ribs Smoked & Glazed in Roy's Original Mongolian Sauce. A bit cliche, but they were finger lickin' good! My step-daughter and I shared the Crispy Spicy Ahi Sushi Roll with Ginger Wasabi Beurre Blanc -- it was huge and almost a meal. The rolls were fresh, crunchy, and had a little kick . . . not too spicy. It was a good thing I agreed to help her with it! For entrees, my hubby had the Roy's Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi with Spicy Soy Mustard Butter Sauce. It, too, was an ample portion of tender ahi that was complimented by the sauce but no overpowered by it. My step-daughter had the Roy's Roasted Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi with Maine Lobster Essence. Another nice portion of perfectly cooked Mahi.  We all were starting to feel the aloha spirit . . . I had to be the exception by ordering off the regular menu and chose my most favorite entree of all . . . the Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish . . . Aah, what a delight, so melt-in-your-mouth delicate . . . I was in island heaven.  Desserts were total home runs -- the melting hot chocolate souffle is mandatory for any chocolate lover. In fact, it tastes the same at every Roy's we've been to . . . it never disappoints. A total surprise . . . and a delightful one . . . was the chocolate coconut cheesecake which came with a side of mango sorbet . . . or did she say it was pineapple sorbet . . . whatever . . . it was the perfect accompaniment to the light and fluffy cheesecake.  We also ordered a bottle of Newton claret which was a modestly priced wine and as my husband said as he swirled and sipped it . . . "I know my wines . . . " Having to always be the exception, I ordered the he Original Hawaiian Martini, which was what I considered my dessert. It was a juicy combination of Maui pineapple, vodka and coconut rumMMMMM!  It was truly a beautiful evening from start to finish. You may be asking why I didn't give it five stars then if there were no misfires . . . that five star is reserved for Roy's Hawaiian restaurants that really do create the aloha experience with some special touches only that can only be enjoyed there!

It has to be eons since we've been to Chompie's for Sunday brunch, or any other meal for that matter. When we first moved to Scottsdale seven and half years ago, Chompie's was our go-to place . . . it didn't matter if we wanted breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Personally, I could eat breakfast for all my meals anyway so Chompie's fits the bill perfectly for me. But we tired of it after probably four years and thousands upon thousands of calories . . . so we gave it a rest, a two and a half year rest. And the funny thing is . . . now having gone back for brunch, I think I could put Chompie's back on our regular go-to rotation.  Some things have changed since we were last there, but all for the good . . . new upholstery, new look to the menu, new carpet . . . but the same faces are still there . . . and the good old standby items are still on the menu . . . Service on this particular Sunday at 11 am was brisk, polite, friendly. The coffee refills came on time without even asking. If I had any complaints, it was that the napkins are a little thin for such huge and sometimes messy meals and they neglected to set out place with knives.    My French omelet was divine, cooked perfectly.  I asked for the onions to be almost overcooked and they were, and my eggs were soft. If there is the slightest bit of brown on my omelet, it's a minus sign in my book. I usually can't finish a 3-egg omelet, but this was so delicious, I almost finished it -- okay, I left one bite. The home fries were also yummy, some a little charred, just the way I like it.  My hubby had the Long Island Expressway Skillet which came with plenty of Nova Lox, cheese, mushrooms, onions, scallions and potatoes. Loved it!  As were were approaching the restaurant an older couple in a car rolled down the window, said they were from out of town visiting and asked where Goldman's was located . . . I said, you are in Chompie's parking lot, stay here, you'll love it . . . it's an experience!  Somehow I made it past the bakery without buying a thing! Everything looks so pretty. They even have high-heel shoe pastry.  That was new to me! I'm sure we'll be back soon and I won't be able to control my urges.  Thanks, Chompie's, for reminding me of what I was missing . . .

We love Italian food done right!  Living in Scottsdale for the past five years, we hadn't found an Italian restaurant that we could call "home" until a friend recommended La Torretta . . . and now, I'm hooked!    From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted with warm and friendly service, and it doesn't stop there.  The owners of La Torretta are on site, and everything oozes "mom and pop" and "son" . . . Compare that with the two opposing corners of busy Scottsdale Road and Frank Lloyd Wright which house two of the largest cookie-cutter chain Italian restaurants in the area.  La Torretta is hands down, head and shoulders above the rest!    The portions are hearty, but not overwhelmingly so, and they are more than willing to do things to your specifications or whim!  Big high fives for the butternut squash ravioli that melts in your mouth.  The clams oreganate (on the appetizer menu) is enough for a meal, especially when you have to lap up every drop off the sauce.   One more thing that sets La Torretta in a different class is that the owners care about their clientele and they often give back to their community by offering special menus with proceeds benefitting local charities.  In such difficult economic times, it is such a rarity to find such generosity.  Bravo to La Torretta!

One of my favorite quick go-to sushi restaurants when I am meeting friends in that area.    The restaurant aesthetically and general ambiance is nothing to right home about by any stretch of the imagination, but it is comfortable, quick, and most importantly, reliable for good sushi.   Two things I love on the menu -   Sushi Ko roll - baked rock shrimp, scallops, and crab over a spice tuna roll.  It is not fried, but served warm.  It is a satisfying meld of flavors and textures. I dare anyone not to love it!  Sashimi Salad - Tuna over mostly lettuce. I ask for it with the Sushi Ko House dressing instead of the special soy dressing. Makes a huge difference.  The sushi chefs are very accommodating if you want to make changes.  Yesterday I asked if I could have the Red Snapper (my new favorite fish)instead of the tuna in the sashimi salad. It was heavenly! It was served with heaps of the red snapper on the plate, a rarity in a sushi restaurant.  Are there more innovative sushi restaurants in the area? Absolutely.  But there is a reason Sushi Ko has been around for fifteen years -- no frills, reliably fresh and moderately priced -- it will always be on my dining repertoire!

After the Pei Wei identity theft closures and subsequent reopening, this Pei Wei has gotten even worse! My Japanese Teriyaki with shrimp tasted off as did the vegetable spring rolls. The shrimp in the Teriyaki bowl was the smallest I have ever seen them use, and the vegetables in the spring rolls were hard and tasteless. This is the second time this has happened. The first time I thought it was an anomaly; this time I am wondering if Pei Wei changed their "formula"??? Don't waste your time or taste buds!

High on Pie! (For your pies only . . . )   We were shopping at the Anthem Outlets and decided to make the additional 13 mile trip north on I-17 to the Rock Springs Cafe to do some take-home pie! After reading the previous reviews, I couldn't make up my mind which pie to choose, so hubby and I initially made a pact on the trip there that we would get one or two pieces of each -- a tasting extravaganza, so to speak! Once we walked into the general store, my husband made a bee line to the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie and grabbed a whole one! Then, he said, "get whichever one you want." I thought he was joking, but he wasn't. I could not bare to bring home another whole pie (these are not your typical supermarket 8" or 9" pies), so I picked a slice of peach and a slice of blueberry. My hubby chose to get a piece of rhubarb crumble.   After we had dinner, at home, and digested it, hubby cut himself a gigantic slice of the JD pecan. He oohed and aahed . . . then said, "this is the best pecan pie I've ever had . . . " I had a teeny bite of his, and then had to have my own small slice. It was heavenly . . . not as gooey sweet as regular pecan -- it must be because of the JD. Loved every bite. Then I had a "taste" of the blueberry -- OMG -- my most favorite blueberry pie -- even beats out the blueberry pies that were made at summer camp in Maine, when we actually picked the fresh blueberries of the bushes ourselves!   I am eager to try the peach . . . as well as the pecan sticky buns. I have been told everything freezes well, and will last 4-5 days in the fridge. I'm sure I'll have more to say after my taste buds savor those goodies!   Rock Springs Pies . . . worth the drive and the calories   As a side note, the little farmer's market and store on its north side have an incredible array of specialty items, like flavored honeys and butters. The sweet potato butter is to die for!!!!

Great theater that hearkens back to the olden days when theaters were elaborate in design and a production in and of themselves. Seats, despite being traditional, are comfy. I don't think there's a bad sight line in the house. We were in the 21st row, center and had no view or sound problems.  I especially loved that they served coffees and cappuccinos in the lobby.

I was looking for some pretty basic khaki shorts and my friend and I popped into Talbots at Scottsdale Fashion Square. So, I didn't get a pair of shorts because they were low on sizes, but I must have tried on so many other pieces. My friend did find two of the most perfect black 3/4-sleeve t-shirts, and I found a sleeveless cutaway polo that works with just about everything in my wardrobe.   The women who work here were so helpful and patient that I have to give them a major shout out -- Robin and Ida -- you were fabulous! You made it a very comfortable shopping experience!

I am still thinking about the miso-glazed salmon, and we dined there four days ago . . .   I am the kind of person who bases my reviews of a restaurant not only on the food, but the ambiance, and pretty much weigh them equally when determining my rating. Elements satisfied both those categories and more.   Just driving up to the Sanctuary where you are greeted by friendly valets makes you feel special. They ask if you have been there before and wish you a great time, telling you you'll have a special evening. Maybe that puts everyone in a positive frame of mind to begin with. The restaurant itself is striking. We arrived just as the sun was setting. We walked out on the deck/patio and watched for a few minutes. At the same time we were able to see the spectacular pool and grounds of the resort as well as the lively goings on on the deck. Everyone looked like they were having the best time! This is definitely the place to go for just drinks!   We made our reservation with Open Table. When Elements called to confirm, I asked for a booth with a great view, and that is exactly what we received. Our waiter was enthusiastic, but not over the top. We asked a lot of questions about menu items and he offered his suggestions. He was patient with my needing more time to decide, and he was not confounded when I asked him which entree was a better choice, when clearly I asked him to compare apples and oranges. Usually, I get the answer, "which do you prefer, beef or fish?" I like a waiter who is confident in manner and trusts that in either instance I will have a great meal so he's not afraid to give a direct answer.   On to the food . . . hubby had the Island Creek oysters and the elemental soup which was lobster bisque with corn. He thought the oysters were just perfect and the soup, which he didn't even offer me a spoonful, perfection. My cousin had the spinach and frisee salad, which she thought was so clean and fresh. I ordered the dungeness crab and spinach hot pie for the table to share. It came with perfectly seasoned taro chips. The "hot pie" was rich and creamy. One bite would cover Weight Watchers points for an entire day! Needless to say, we scooped up every bite with the taro chips and then used the spoon to polish off every last bit of it!   Hubby had the bacon wrapped filet of beef with garlic mash, blue cheese, balsamic onions, merlot demi glace. I did get a bite of his filet, and it melted in my mouth. Hubby said the combined flavors of the beef with the garlic, blue cheese and balsamic onions were superb. My cousin had the duck. She had a hard time making up her mind, but said that she definitely made the right choice. She was so happy. I can't speak to the dish myself since I didn't have a taste. I ordered the miso glazed organic salmon with skillet roasted vegetables, somen noodles, toasted coriander. I generally do not order salmon in restaurants as my hubby makes the best salmon around, but since our waiter said that they were known for this dish, I went for it. Wow! Perfectly cooked (I think this might be a first for a restaurant in my experience)! It far surpassed hubby's version (sorry :( ) Everything about this dish was top notch. As I said above . . . I'm still savoring it in my mind.   We opted to skip dessert, but they brought the check with three warm 5-spice chocolate chip cookies. Yum!   Elements is now at the top of my list for special occasions, and maybe less than special occasions. Do I really have to wait for another special occasion to go back? Oh, my birthday is in three weeks!!! You'll see me there!

We wound up here unexpectedly when we found out the crepe place in the same center is closed on Mondays.  Wanting real table service instead of ordering at the counter at Wildflower, we spied the Cove as we were walking back to our cars.  At 12:30 on a Monday, it was virtually empty.    The menu looked good enough with plenty to choose from.  Both my friend and I wanted salads.  She ordered the calamari and I chose the Asian Chicken.  Her calamari was slathered with breading, and my chicken was dry to the bone.  We both agreed that we should have gone to Wildflower where the salads are always reliably fresh and tasty.  Our server was actually very nice and gracious. But for me, it's a combination of food, ambiance and service that make a restaurant rate above a 2-star, and the food and ambiance at the Cove didn't cut it for me.

How is it that I did not know about this place in the almost eight years I've lived here in Scottsdale? After we dropped our dogs off at 7 Dogs Grooming, we walked across the courtyard and saw how busy this place is . . . we just had to try it out!   First of all, let's just talk about its concept -- part breakfast and lunch restaurant, part general store/convenience store, part post office -- a true throwback to the western days of yore.   You can dine inside or out . . . inside is dark and homey . . . outside is the place to be in the often gorgeous Scottsdale weather. We opted for outside even though there was a little bit of a wait. I was totally surprised when they handed me a buzzer to let me know when our table was ready. (Oh how I wish every restaurant would do this!)  The hostess was so friendly and accommodating . . . made us feel like family right from the get-go!  The outside patio is uber dog friendly, and I am sure we will be bringing our fur-kids with us next time. The tables are also large and the seats comfortable (nothing too skimpy like some outdoor patios). And the courtyard is so lovely with fountains and plants.   Once we were seated, our waitress took our beverage order -- coffee came in a carafe (something else I wish every restaurant would do except fine dining!) -- and it was good and hot! We both ordered the three-egg omelets . . . hubby had the meat and I had the spinach. Both came with choice of home fries or hash browns and choice of toast (or tomatoes). The waitress recommended the hash browns over the home fries, so we took her advice.  Per my usual, I ordered my omelet done on the soft side. When our waitress brought it out, she exclaimed, "that doesn't look like soft to me; let me take it back and have it done again. It'll just be a few minutes!"  What a doll!  That is exceptional service! Most servers would set it down and not bother unless I said something. When she returned, just a few minutes later, I had the perfect omelet! I also asked for my hash browns well, and that's exactly what I got!  Hubby enjoyed his omelet, but thought there wasn't enough meat . . . I saw what it looked like and it was packed with plenty of meat!  I thought the portion sizes were just enough and the value excellent!  I love this place!  We'll be back again and again! (No more driving double miles to get to Chompie's for an omelet!)

I was starting to feel like I'll never find exceptional sushi in Scottsdale, especially close-by in North Scottsdale. I have been driving by Toyama almost every day for almost two years, never thinking it was a restaurant . . . then one day, I stumbled upon a Yelp review while looking for something completely unrelated. I am elated!  Toyama is totally unassuming and unpretentious. We were greeted warmly as soon as we walked in the door by Mo, the owner, who creates the delicious fare. He really must love what he does as he wore a smile on his face the entire time we were there. Next time, we will sit at the sushi bar so that we can get to know him as we will surely be back again and again.   Everything we ate was top-notch, fresh, flavorful. We ordered the Sushi B dinner which came with California Roll (which for a small add on we upgraded to spicy tuna) and six pieces of sushi. Oh, and we got the "real" wasabi -- so different from the powdery stuff you normally get -- a nice bite with a sweet finish. That alone is reason to go back. My husband had the miso soup and a salad came with our Sushi B. Loved the dressing on the salad. The real kicker was the Orange Cup Tuna - chunky pieces of tuna, dressed with a citrus sesame sauce presented in a cut out orange rind. Simply magnificent. The Volcano Roll was delicious as well, although I prefer the raw vs. cooked fish.  We contemplated going back the next night, but as hungry as we were, we knew on a Friday night we'd have a long wait. We will definitely be back mid-week so that we can nab a spot at the sushi bar to savor the divine sushi.

It was my birthday, and though most times I want to pick the most extravagant restaurant I can find to celebrate, this night I had a hankering for Chinese. It's been forever since I've had Chinese, and the only place I've ever liked in the North Scottsdale area has been Jade Palace on Shea. We've now moved to way, way North Scottsdale, so it was time to try out the sister restaurant at the Pinnacle of Scottsdale Plaza.  I don't know what it is about this complex, but it houses two of our other favorite restaurants . . . Toyama (for Japanese) and Parmigiano Italian Bistro. Jade Palace made it a perfect trifecta!  First of all, I was surprised at how large the space is, and you would never know from the outside what a lovely patio they have. The perfect evening weather made it a no-brainer to sit outside. It faces a little water feature, walkway bridge and lots of foliage. Except for the noise from Jalapeno's across the way, I felt like I was in another world.  Tables are spaced well so you don't feel like you are on top of any other diners.  When we arrived, we were welcomed by everyone, including the owner.  They have a nice little bar area, and the waiting area has plenty of room if you have to wait for a table. But we didn't have to wait since we called forty-five minutes ahead and made a reservation.  After all, it was a Saturday night. I loved, too, that they had live instrumental music which was perfectly toned and didn't interfere with conversation.  Our server was polite and attentive but didn't have much personality. As I looked around, this seemed to be the case overall, except for the darling girl who also works at the Shea location who we've come to know from dining there for so many years.  No harm, no foul, in the service department.  The North Scottsdale location seems to have the almost identical menu as the Shea location as I remembered. My husband had the hot and sour soup which he claimed is the best in the valley, and maybe even better than any he's had anywhere!  They serve complimentary crispy fried wontons with hot mustard and the most divine duck sauce west of New York!  We also ordered the sauteed green beans which were so delicious I might just have to stop for takeout to have with our home prepared meals.  My husband had the special Chow Fun noodles. They are delicious!  All they need is a :drop" of soy to compliment the flavors of the chicken, beef and shrimp amid the thick noodles. My favorite dish on the menu is the Home Style Bean Curd.  I have never tasted tofu and vegetables this incredible! The sauce is a little spicy but they will accommodate your preference of spicy, and I always get medium.    With the warm weather comes dining out more often so we don't have to heat up the kitchen . . . there is no doubt we'll be spending quite a few evenings somewhere in the Pinnacle at Scottsdale Plaza, Jade Palace included!!!

Tonto Bar & Grill is tops on our list! We took out-of-town friends for dinner since they wanted to see what restaurants are in our "backyard". Tonto Bar & Grill did us proud once again. We were seated promptly in the fireplace room which is adjacent to the bar. It was cozy and comfortable on this particular chilly night.   First, they brought a basket of bread. Tucked amongst the ordinary bread were freshly baked petite muffins, spicy and delicious, perfect for holiday time. I asked if they had any other bread which was not seeded for my husband, and then they brought out the most divine bread twists which we learned we didn't get at first because they were still baking. They were like twisted croissants, buttery and warm. We all could have filled up on the muffins and twist alone.   Starters: Hubby had the Braised Ham Hock & White Northern Bean with Fresh Herb & Walnut Pesto which he devoured without even offering a taste to me! I had the Tempura Ahi Tuna Roll with the Wasabi Soy Vinaigrette, not the usual kind of thing one would order at a Southwestern style restaurant, but it was easily on par with some of the best sushi restaurants in Scottsdale. The wasabi soy vinaigrette had just the perfect bite and did not overpower the melt-in-your-mouth ahi. Our friends both had starter salads. both commenting on the freshness of the greens.   Entrees: Hubby ordered the Pork Schnitzel with came with Warm German Potato Salad, Lemon Caper Butter, Green Beans, Carrots & Spiced Apple. He was in "Seventh Heaven". Our friend ordered the Orange Barbecued All-Natural Salmon on Sweet Potato, Poblano Pepper & Roasted Corn Hash, Sautéed Spaghetti Squash, Spinach, Roasted Garlic & Mesquite Honey Jus. "The sauce is incredible . . . " he kept saying over and over again. My friend and I shared the Vegetarian Nosh, heaping servings of a choice of five vegetables amongst a list of about a dozen with a choice of one sauce. The Sweet Potato-Quinoa Cakes, butternut squash risotto and the spaghetti squash and spinach were my favorites. This is also a fantastic dish to order for everyone to share as we had plenty of leftovers (I think we might have gone overboard on the bread now that I think about it!)   Service: Our server was pleasant and efficient . . . perhaps a little too efficient overall since our entrees came out before I had finished my ahi. And for this reason only, I couldn't give Tonto Bar & Grill five stars.   And in the end . . . to top off the evening of great food, our server wrapped up the rest of the breads for us to take home! Yum!

Love, love, love Tonto.  Just had the sand dabs . . . never ever had sand dabs before . . .  ridiculously delicious!!!  On a wickedly busy night, with private parties in the main rooms and patios, Tonto still delivered with excellent service and great food!  It is my "go to" restaurant when we have company from out of town!

We love this homey diner tucked into the old west backdrop of Cave Creek that serves up delicious moist pancakes on their own or accompanying any other entree. It's also a fun place to people-watch as you will see all kinds dropping in for their morning fill-up! I always get a good belly laugh when I look around the room!   Sometimes the service is a little slow to start, but it is basically seat yourself so when they are busy, I can understand it being difficult to figure out who just sat down. No worries . . . once you order up, you're in great hands! The servers are friendly and patient (especially when I have a difficult time making up my mind) . . . and they always have lots of newspapers to read if you're sitting at the counter!   The choices are plentiful and so are the portions! As many times as I have been here, I still haven't gotten up the nerve to order the oven baked apple pancake, but it looks and smells so yummy! I'll need a full six-top of friends and family to help me with it . . . but I will someday (hopefully sooner than later)! The omelettes are also cooked to perfection and when I ask for my hash browns well . . . I get them very well, thank you.   Not only is Oak's Diner and Flapjacks a great place for breakfast, but it's also a fun way to start off your day exploring the Old West of Cave Creek!

I had no expectations for Giordano's . . . none at all. That's good thing because I hate being disappointed. I should try that approach with all restaurants. This lovely Italian Trattoria in a strip mall in Carefree is terrific. It is so totally unpretentious - a welcome break from so many of today's Italian restaurants - especially those that have displaced the little Mom and Pop shops.   The service was not over the top either. Our waitress gave us plenty of time to chat with our friends without rushing us to order and just asked us to flag her down when we were ready. I was a little overwhelmed by the menu which had so many traditional Italian items. My eyes lit up when I saw two of my favorites - eggplant parmigiana and eggplant rollatini. I chose the rollatini and it was so delicious. The eggplant was perfectly cooked and the filling was so rich and creamy. The marinara was so tasty, I almost could have eaten it in a bowl by itself. All the main entrees come with a side of spaghetti or penne. My husband had the special of the day, veal rollatini. It was the best Italian dish he has had in ages. Our friends had the chicken Marsala and the veal parmigiana, both which they proclaimed were excellent.   Hubby and I split a yummy chocolate dessert laced with a hint of orange which looked like it was bought at a bakery, not made in house. Nevertheless, it was divine. We would have been satisfied with our meal without it, but just had a hankering for something sweet. If the decision was up to me solely, I would have had the cannoli -- do you sense a them here -- that I like thinks that are rolled up and stuffed with cheese? I do. Next time, I'll have the cannoli, but it probably won't live up to my friend Jan's homemade.   Since it is so close to home, we will be putting Giordano's on our "regular" list. Buon appetito!!

We were so disappointed, and not that we expected to see the famous "family" or Chumlee, but it was so not what you see on TV. The shop is a dump for the most part and much smaller, darker, and dustier than it looks on TV. We waited in line outside for about 20 minutes as they send you inside as people leave to avoid a zoo atmosphere. One-half of the store is filled with Pawn Stars promotional garbage like mugs, shirts, posters and bobble heads. I asked one of the gentlemen behind the jewelry counter where everything is and he said a few blocks away but you won't be able to go there. Other than seeing the Superbowl ring display in the jewelry case, I was not impressed with any of the merchandise on hand.  Apparently, you have to have a "black" card to lay your hands on the really cool stuff!  I guess the only glimpse I'll ever get of those is from watching Pawn Stars on TV from the comfort of my own home. P.S. I hear the guys are usually there on Monday and Friday.

Just returned from a three-night stay . . . Most of the positive things about the Bellagio have been said over and over again.   Here's what I love about the Bellagio: There is security at the elevators checking room keys. Might be a little willy-nilly, but just having someone there keeps the riff-raff away.  The ever-changing conservatory and botanical garden is always a surprise and amazingly beautiful, aromatic, fun and colorful. In all the years we have been going, we have never seen the same display twice! No crazies at the pool! Casino smoke is not overpowering like other mega resorts. (We've been through them all, and played at most, so we know.) The location is the best on the Strip, a short walk or tram ride to some of the world's best shopping and dining.  We have friends who were Bellagio die-hards, but when the newer places opened, they had to try them (Palazzo, Aria, Wynn, Cosmopolitan, etc.) . . . they now have come back to Bellagio and swear they will never stay anywhere else.  Words of advice . . . if you are unhappy about something, physically go to the Front Desk, don't just call. A voice on the phone is easy to refuse, but a face-to-face person can't be ignored. Plus, they don't want other people to hear your frustration or complaint, so they are quick to resolve on the spot!

It has been almost a year since our last stay at the Bellagio, and in my opinion, things have gotten even better. Perhaps it is the newer competition that has driven Bellagio to step up its game.  My newest favorite at Bellagio (and it's really not that new, just new to me) is the VIP Cypress Lounge at the pool area. Drop $75 a person, per day, and you get the most comfortable lounger, freebies like mini cups of virgin smoothies, cool cucumbers, and tasty orange sections. More importantly, you get personalized attention when you want it. Service is with a big friendly smile. The patrons there seemed less inclined to show off their bodies and tans, and were a more mellow crowd than the groups fighting over lounge chairs and umbrellas, drinking carelessly, shouting and causing a ruckus. It was so relaxing. This is the only way to do a pool day at the Bellagio!  Another thing I noticed was the abundance of drink attendants throughout the casino. They were actually more personable than ever before. No waiting to flag someone down, having to spend more time at a slot machine because you're tied to it waiting for the server to bring your drink order.   One of the major standouts to us was that we ate at fewer Bellagio restaurants this time and tried a couple of sister restaurants to Bellagio's greatest Yellowtail (Japanese) and Picasso (French). We ate at the recently opened Kumi (Japanese) at Mandalay Bay and Julian Serrano (Spanish Tapas) at Aria. They were a disappointment, to say the least, compared to their Bellagio outposts. Bellagio definitely scores way ahead of the other MGM properties in the restaurant department.   As an aside, the new alliance between MGM/M Life and Hyatt is a real bonus now. If you are a member of both frequent guest programs, you can earn points and stays which is a real plus for us Hyatt die-hards. Stay and spend money at Bellagio (or any other MGM Las Vegas property with a few exclusions) and you can earn Hyatt Gold Passport points and stay credits. Finally, a quasi-Hyatt presence in Las Vegas!  Just gives us more reason to head back to the Bellagio!

Jade Palace reminds me of the East Coast Chinese food that I used to have.  The New York egg rolls are fantastic, and the duck sauce is an A+.  They used to have cold sesame noodles on the menu, which is one of my favorites and hard to find in Chinese restaurants here in AZ, but if you ask, they will make it for you.  The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside it is comfortable and very upscale.  The prices are moderate and the portions generous.  Their lunch specials are terrific!

RA! RAH! RAH! If I was writing about the Arizona locations, I probably would have rated it a three-star, if that, but this location situated on the plaza at the Fashion Show Mall has always been a favorite of mine.  The lunch Bento boxes are a bargain -- good on quality, great on quantity. What really wowed me was the Dengaku Tofu - Crispy like tempura but not greasy fried tofu served with tempura sauce with a red miso ginger glaze. Absolutely delicious! The Hamachi nigiri was very good, but if you want sushi, there are better places.  Service was pleasant and attentive. The only negative -- sitting on the outside patio listening to competing music with the restaurant next door as well as the ambiant noise from the center itself and Las Vegas Boulevard.

When I am in the mood for an omelet, hash browns and sourdough, this is my new go-to place! I don't care that I live 45 minutes away, and frankly, I don't care about the wait either!  MBB is worth every penny! So the place is really a hole in the wall, and it is noisy at full capacity. I haven't gotten out of a sit-down breakfast joint with even mediocre omelets and terrible coffee for less than $25.00 for two, but at MBB, we hit the jackpot! Here, I got a fluffy omelet with mushrooms (not from a can) and a mound of cheddar cheese, cooked perfectly (and I didn't even have to ask for it on the soft side), along with a heaping portion of the best tasting hash browns (fully cooked and not part raw)! And the sourdough toast . . . at least an inch thick, already buttered -- yes, buttered -- with homemade strawberry jam on the side. And, did I mention how great the coffee is, and within about four sips, they are there to give you a refill without having to wave them down?  Everyone was so nice, from the nice young man who seated us, to the two (or three) waitresses that alternately handled our table (one took our order, two refilled our coffee, another took our bill). Service was top-notch! I can't think of any restaurant in our area of North Scottsdale that is even close to being this good! Especially for the price!  When our waitress asked if she could get us anything else, I said, "another Matt's Big Breakfast . . . in North Scottsdale!"  I've already started coming up with a list of things we have to do in Phoenix so that we can go back to Matt's again!

Absolutely love this restaurant, and for so many reasons . . .   First, it is family owned (always like to support the little independents), and the owners are so nice and friendly (more on that below) . . .   Secondly, the food is awesome and portions are generous. The hummus is heavenly. The babaganoush is brilliant. The dolmas, delightful. And that's just for starters.   Here's what tipped the scales way in their favor . . .   We stopped in on a lark on a Tuesday night to order take-out. Just as we placed our order for the combination appetizer plate and the kefta and chicken combo entree, the wife came out of the kitchen to serve a couple nearby. The scent of the entree as it passed by was perfume to my nose and senses. I asked, "what was that?" The owner enthusiastically replied, "We are serving Passover dinner this week, and that's our brisket." "Oh my, I said. That smelled so incredible." The wife of a couple seated next to us said, "it is the best I have ever had." As a Jewish girl, growing up on the best brisket ever made, only by my mother, that was a throwdown for me to try some. The owner asked me if I want to try some. I think he noticed that my eyes were popping out of their sockets and a little drool was coming out of my mouth. "Oh yes!" He proceeded to serve me a nice-sized slice of brisket which he said mother cooked over eight hours. It was as delicious as I remembered my mother's to be and ordered an entire entree to take home. Then, I said, "it's missing only one thing . . . horseradish . . . " To my surprise, the wife said to wait, she had some in the kitchen. I couldn't wait to get up and gobble up more of the fragrant and perfectly cooked to perfection brisket. That's the upside . . . the down side is that it's not on the menu any other time of the year . . .   That being said, our other entree was equally worth returning for the other 51 weeks. Not to be forgotten is their rice chock full of raisins and almonds which accompanies the entrees.   I can't believe that it took me five and a half years to find this place. I can't wait to go back for more!

This was not our first experience at Sensi. We were fans from almost the day it opened at Bellagio several years ago. We had some extraordinary meals there. Maybe it was an off night, but our latest experience wasn't anything close to the Sensi we remembered from not even a year ago.    Ambiance and decor is still outstanding . . . and one of the few places in the area that is not overwrought with 20-something women in stilettos and men in their saggy jeans.   There were ample items on the menu that sounded delicious, but in reality did not live up to our expectations. Unlike one of the previous posters, we found the Sensi Roll Call sampler almost too ambitious with a combination of flavors that left a sour aftertaste.  We also had the Sensi Original Noodle. While the combination of the various items reminded us of something along the line of a pad thai or chow fun type dish, it was actually heavily laden with cumin. Oh, how I wish the item description would have said so . . . cumin, while a great antioxidant, is one of my least favorite herbs . . . so disappointed.  The house-made naan bread was stellar . . . I could have eaten at least two bread baskets all by myself! The best part of the entire meal . . .   Unfortunately, the less than stellar food along with the surly manner of our waiter made for a very lackluster culinary experience.

5 stars across the board . . . My 5-star reviews are few and far between these days, particularly because many of the restaurants I've visited in the past few months have missed the mark in some way or another.  Social House provided that rare experience that combines the best of ambiance, food and service.   The modern restaurant is visually stunning from the moment you first walk into the lounge area and then sashay up to the host table. We had made a last minute Open Table reservation on a Friday night, and we were seated as soon as we came in. I loved the set up of the restaurant. First, they put us in the back area, but it was a little too dark for my taste, so we asked if we could have one of the booths in the front section. They were so accommodating, and said we would love this new table as it gave us a view of everyone who parades by. And it sure did! I am 100 percent sure my husband was the oldest person in the restaurant, and even being 16 years his junior, I am about 80 percent sure that I was the next oldest. But it sure was fun people watching . . . bachelor and bachelorette parties galore with some of the most interestingly dressed and entertaining people gliding by us.  Our server was fabulous! The menu offers so many wonderful options and he helped guide us through the choices, pointing out the fabulous and steering us away from the ordinary. We started with the Yellowtail Jalapeno. Don't be put off thinking it might be too spicy . . . it's not . . . a perfect melding of flavors with the tender Yellowtail and the crunchy jalapeno in a cilantro soy base. Next up . . . the salmon tartare, which was my favorite. The combination of the fresh and silky salmon layered with wasabi cream and drizzled with citrus soy was heavenly . . . so much so that I ordered another just for myself while hubby was licking his chops -- literally -- the tender Kurabuta Pork Ribs smothered in a sweet soy glaze were falling off the bone. We then shared the Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups . . . while we loved the dish, we found this a little skimpy for the price with only two pieces. As I was getting quite full, I opted to order only the roasted miso eggplant which put the finishing touches on my great meal.. My hubby with his big appetite ordered the hangar steak with roasted shallots and more of that delectable wasabi cream sauce. From pig heaven to cow heaven!  Social House is totally a hip place, even for us not-so-hip middle-agers. We had a fantastic meal, conscientious service and "free" entertainment. No doubt we will make another trip to Social House on our next trip to LV.  P.S. Unlike some other reviewers, we felt we got great bang for our buck!

Hey folks, this is the Bellagio Cafe in Las Vegas not Denny's in Podunkville, so it's going to be on the expensive side, but you do get what you pay for and what you don't!  What you don't get . . . ketchup in dirty refilled bottles, sticky maple syrup bottles, paper napkins, and the list goes on and on!  What you do get is great atmosphere, delicious food and courteous service. Even while standing line (and there often is a long line), you get to enjoy the stunning seasonal display and fragrant smells of the Bellagio Conservatory. Our favorite spot to sit is in the clover-shaped 4-plex booth to the left when you walk up the ramp, facing the conservatory . . . what a view and you get some of the best people watching in Vegas!  The food is consistently delicious.  Over the years (most recently in early March 2012), we have tried just about everything on the breakfast and lunch menus. For breakfast, I highly recommend the Bellagio Classic Omelet or the Maryland Crab Cake Benedict.  I always ask for my eggs on the soft side and they have never failed me. I also like my hash browns well, almost burnt, and they for the most part, that's what I get. For lunch, try the Cobb. My husband swears by it!  Coffee is top notch, and they will leave a carafe on your table. They have real cream or milk, not the faux stuff that comes in mini plastic cups. I adore the fact that when you order an iced tea, the ice cubes are actually made with the tea itself as well.   We used to love to linger in the cafe when they had Keno, but they have removed the game it seems from all MGM Mirage properties across the board. So sad! We really missed it on this trip!

It's been about two years since we went to MBFG in Old Town. After we were seated and already ordered the Saganaki, I realized why we hadn't been in such a long time . . . the place is a d-u-m-p!  The only atmosphere that reminds me that we're in a Greek restaurant is the startling cry of "Opa!" when the flaming whatevers are brought out from the kitchen.    Once I got past that, I was able to concentrate on the actual food and drink.  Apparently, they are changing the menu and they were out of quite a few of the better known, middle-of-the-road type wines and had only Greek varieties available. Greek wine? Would it taste like ouzo? The water, by the way, does not taste filtered, even with a lemon wedge, it tasted industrial strength.  Saganaki, according to my friend and my husband, was divine. The combination platter was huge, enough for three people with dolmades, spanikopita, koftes, tzaziki, and hummus.  MBFG is one of the few restaurants in the area that put lamb in the dolmades.  Very delicious! The spanikopita was light, fluffy and perfectly seasoned. The koftes was also very flavorful. I am not a fan of their hummus (too sour), nor their tzaziki (too runny).  Their pita was on the hard side and a little too greasy for my taste. Hubby had the pastitsia which he enjoyed . . . a nice hint of nutmeg sealed the deal. My girlfriend had the Greek salad . . . a big disappointment.  It had all the right veggies, but the dressing tasted like Caesar . . . a major faux pas for my girlfriend who is the Greek food diva!  I have been to the Paradise Valley location and the atmosphere is much more spirited and well, it just looks brighter.  The Old Town location is like eating in a cave.  If you can get past that, you can have an enjoyable meal.  I can't speak to the service since it was a very quiet Sunday night and our server was quite attentive . . .

We finally made it to Yasu and it is now at the top of our list for sushi restaurants. It's a little far from home, so it won't be a regular stop, but when we're planning to be in the Paradise Valley area, we will certainly make reservations to dine here. Who would have thought, in the dead of summer, at 5:30 pm they would have no inside table available? Okay, granted it is a small restaurant, but like a previous reviewer, I found the ambiance and decor inside lovely. They also have fantastic background music, at least on this night . . . a nice mix of jazz (Diana Krall) and standards.   Because they had no available tables inside so we opted to sit outside on this sultry evening. There are no misters on the patio, but the little discomfort did not take anything away from the fabulous meal we ordered.   They have a great tapas menu which gives diners and newbies like us a chance to taste a multitude of items at what I would consider very reasonable prices. (There has to be another word in Japanese instead of the Spanish tapas to use instead.) They also had "happy hour" drinks for $5, so we each had a Shochu cocktail - his with cranberry, mine a mix of cranberry and grapefruit. Refreshing!   We started with the Red Snapper sushi - OMG, it melted in my mouth. It was so fresh. I could have ordered more and just made this my meal . . . the best red snapper I have tasted bar none . . . including Tokyo!   A total hit was the Bistro Green Beans which were flash-fried (no breading) and had a melding of incredible flavors. The beans were so fresh and cooked to perfection with a little snap in each bite. I have had this dish, or similar ones, at other Asian restaurants, and what set Yasu's apart was that it was not oily or greasy.   The shrimp noodle skewers were more a novelty than a great choice. Minced shrimp, skewered and then encircled with an abundance of noodles wrapped around them was the only disappointing item we had. Too much noodle to get to the shrimp. I deconstructed the noodle on my plate to get to a bite of shrimp.   The Snake Shiitake was delicious! It was actually fun to eat as well. It has nothing to do with snake . . . the shiitake is cut up into long pieces which resemble snakes. Very creative naming . . .   One of my other favorites is the shrimp stuffed Japanese eggplant. (I am an eggplant lover.) The slightly sweet miso sauce was yummy, and the eggplant tender.   I was full at that point, but my dear hubby had to order one more item, the special roll of the day . . . spicy yellowtail. Beautiful! The yellowtail was so fresh, and the spice just gave it flavor but did not overpower the fish at all. Some sushi places forget that the real star of the roll is the fish and put the emphasis on the spice. Not Yasu!   A comment on the service . . . our server Liz was top-notch. She answered all our menu questions and made excellent recommendations. She was friendly and attentive. When we go back, we will undoubtedly ask to be seated at her table.   One more thing . . . there are lots of veggies on the menu so if you are a die-hard vegetarian like so many of my friends, you will be able to have a great meal here, too.

So I've been in Scottsdale for over five years and I seriously can't believe that last night was the first I heard of That's Amore! We had just finished dinner next door at Thai Pan and as we were saying Arrivederci to our friends who were headed out of town, I looked up and saw the sign. I said, "what's that?" My husband said "That's Amore!" "What is it . . . let's check it out! Ooh, gelato!" I said. He said, "you go, I'll wait." I said, "let's just get a taste." Twenty dollars later we took home four flavors of the most creamy and delectable gelato we've ever tasted.   The owner is the real Italian deal! He has a robust personality and was willing to let us try any (almost all) the flavors. He enthusiastically explained some of the flavors that were unfamiliar, offering up suggestions of what to pair with our chosen flavor, pushing little mini spoonfuls across the counter for our tasting pleasure.   My husband and I are typically on opposite ends of the flavor spectrum. He goes for the fruity and cookie type flavors; I go for the bold chocolates and coffees. Honestly, we couldn't have gone wrong with any of them. What we took home: Black Cherry, Coffee, Malaga (similar to but better than what we know as rum raisin), and Biscotto. If my husband allowed me to choose a few more, I would have gone for the Toblerone (incredible dark chocolate), Amaretto, and Dolci di Latti.   When I got home, I couldn't wait to put a little of each in one dish and devour it, and so I did. The Biscotto was the perfect selection to accompany any of the other three, so it will be a staple in our freezer.   Simply put . . . "That's Amore" . . . "mi piace moltissimo!" (Now go Google that!)

Hubby and I wanted a quickie lunch, no fuss, no muss, so we headed over to Saba's Mediterranean in Carefree.  It had been eons since we ate here, at least two or three years ago.  I remembered fondly the gyro sandwiches.  It's satisfying to know that this little restaurant can still please even the most fussy gyro fan!  It was a different gyro than I remembered, this time with beautifully warmed and toasted pita bread.  At first, it looked like a lot of shredded lettuce, but then after a couple of bites, I hit upon the tender and well-seasoned gyro meat.  The tzaziki sauce was so creamy, I had to ask for more.   It is quite the sandwich.  My hubby had to finish it for me.  Hubby had the kofta sandwich which was equally as flavorful and hefty in portion.    We had the most unique waiter I think we've ever had in any dining out experience.  I asked him where he was from originally (he had an interesting accent -- a little European but sounded Australian -- and he said he was pretty much a nomad who picked up bits and pieces from his travels.  He proceeded to carry on some interesting conversation with us and the other folks dining . . . most of which was historical and philosophical and went way over my head!  But, he was amusing, charming, and great entertainment!  We won't wait so long to go back!

What a delightful find we made tonight! This sweet little bistro is flanked by Starbucks and Subway in North Scottsdale, but has nothing in common with his neighbors! It is authentic, homemade Italian at its best. Inside is a bit kitschy, but it's decorated to resemble a true Italian bistro. The service was efficient and friendly. It helps that the owner makes his rounds, greeting patrons, making sure everything is just right.   First, we were served cheesy bread with a side of marinara -- it was a great starter. With the entrees, they brought warm fresh foccacia and Italian bread (not needed after the cheesy bread, but nevertheless scarfed up by the guys!) I had the cannelloni al forno stuffed with chicken and opted for the marinara sauce instead of the cream sauce. It was a hearty portion, covered in mozzarella. It was delicious . . . My friend had it with the cream sauce and devoured every bite! My husband had the penne al forno, and he proclaimed it to be the best Italian food he's had since we moved here a little over five years ago! Our other companion opted for the Caesar salad (with anchovies) and the stuffed mushrooms, which she loved so much she didn't even offer to share a bite!   We were pleasantly surprised when the owner brought over complimentary cordials of Amaretto for all of us as well as a large portion of tiramisu to share. Wow! And I don't even like tiramisu!   The only reason I didn't give Parmigiano a five-star rating is because the waiter cleared plates while others were still eating, and the tables are on the small side and feel a little cramped.   Definitely we will be back to try more of what this lovely little bistro offers. Buon Appetito!

We don't normally shop for our dogs in designer doggie stores, but something compelled us to go into See Spot Shop.  Perhaps it was the two adorable and well-behaved golden retrievers who spied us from the parking lot who invited us in.  There is nothing pretentious about this store.  The owner is friendly and knowledgeable.  We were looking for something specifically for our dogs that are natural and odorless and they could chew on for a long time.  The owner directed us to the antler dog chews.  I was a bit skeptical, but we brought two home.  Our dogs, who usually abandon all other chews like Nylabones and such, got their paws and teeth on these and wouldn't let go!  They are a little expensive, I thought, but realized later that they could get hours, days, weeks on one antler and be satisfied.  Still, I had to check out the internet prices, and I was so pleased to see that See Spot Shop didn't mark up very much for these incredible treats and that in fact, her antlers sizes were heftier compared to what you get on line for the price.  We are very happy having found this little shop at the Summit in Scottsdale, and we will be frequent visitors.  And it's really cute to see that the two goldens get paid a commission of treats with every customer purchase.

What we expected to be a quick jaunt from Bellagio to the Forum Shops at Caesar's was anything but. Hubby and I had discussed well before we left for Las Vegas that we would try new restaurants this trip which meant skipping Joe's, but as we sashayed through the doors of the Forum Shops, there was Joe's smack dab in front of us, and he was calling our name . . . we thought there was no way on a Friday night without reservations we would get in without a long wait, but we looked at each other, each of us with puppy dog eyes, imploring each other to break the rule we already made and try to get into Joe's. Amazingly enough, they had availability for two in the back dining room in an hour which meant shopping a little longer than expected, but we were entirely grateful for the extra time to spend more money! Ha!  We really didn't have to look at the menu. We knew that a plate of select stone crabs was in order. As many others have said, they come in sizes from small to large and then "select". We always get the select. We are never disappointed. The stone crabs, meaty and succulent, are the star, but the mustard sauce is the kicker. Oh how I love that sauce . . . so much so that when I ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail as my meal, I asked for the mustard sauce instead of the cocktail sauce. Hubby had the Chilean sea bass. It was the best we've ever had in any restaurant. We also ordered the four cheese mac and cheese which was so delectable and creamy. As an aside, you could pick any item from their list of sides and be thoroughly entranced.  Atmosphere at Joe's runs the gamut and can please just about anyone. They have the "outside" patio which provides a casual experience and is perfect for people-watching. Just about everyone who walks into the Forum Shops from Las Vegas Boulevard walks past you. There is the bar room and can watch your favorite game while you drink, dine and root for the home team. And then, my favorite, the back dining room which reminds me of an old Italian steakhouse where your servers are dressed in tuxes and provide some of the best service in Las Vegas. I love the maitre d at the entrance to the back room. Even if he doesn't recognize you, he pretends he does!  That's a real art!

Why don't I think of First Watch more often? It would seem that this great breakfast place would be on my radar . . . it provides the quickie delicious breakfast without sacrificing service. I have been here at least a half-dozen times and I am never disappointed!    It was a fairly busy mid-morning on Sunday, but wait time was less then ten minutes. The actual size is much bigger than it looks from the outside.   Their omelets are a good size and they make them soft when I remember to ask. They made my husband's hard, as he always asks. The potatoes with sauteed onion are seasoned perfectly, and they both came with an English muffin - yum! Our server was friendly and very efficient -- we were in a hurry to get to Scottsdale Fashion Square!

So funny that I've been eating here for eons and yet haven't been compelled to write a review until now. I happen to love Pure Sushi although it caters to an upscale showy crowd most evenings. I try, instead, to go for lunch with my girlfriends which I find to be a delightful experience, especially if the weather lends itself to sitting outside. Inside can be on the noisy side.   I have tried almost every item on the menu it seems. My favorite is and will always be the box sushi. It combines all my favorites -- tuna, salmon, crab mix and rice mixed with smelt eggs. It is always fresh and yummy, and actually needs no accompaniment of soy or ginger. It is that good! The server usually asks if we want them to cut the pieces in half as it is difficult to manage with chopsticks without the "box" falling apart. So, if you do the "Box", definitely have them cut the pieces in half. The White Monster Roll is another winner - shrimp tempura, spicy crab and cucumber inside with baked ahi tuna on top, served with savory peanut vinaigrette sauce and sweet eel sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!   The lunch Bento boxes are wonderful as well. You can't miss with these if you are not a sushi or sashimi person. The soft shell crab is also delectable as a starter or its large enough for a meal if you combine it with another appetizer or small salad. The Katsu style chicken breast is top-notch if you are averse to sushi.   Everything is always fresh. The service is always good, and sometimes even excellent. This is not, however, your neighborhood Japanese sushi joint. Prices are on the higher side, although I am not complaining.   One suggestion is to stagger your order . . . otherwise, you will have a table full of dishes. Go slowly . . . pace yourself . . . so you can really enjoy each bite.

By far the best thing about Grand Lux is that it can satisfy the food cravings of just about everyone when you can't otherwise decide where to go to eat. That Grand Lux serves hefty portions for mid-range prices in the middle of downtown Scottsdale also makes it a winner! The downside is that it is virtually impossible to go there without shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square, and according to my husband, that's dangerous!  We have eaten at GL many times, and we've never had a bad meal. We've always had cheerful service from the staff, except at times the hostesses who never seem to smile. The food is almost identical to the Cheesecake Factory, but presented in a little more upscale fashion. My hubby loves their burgers -- pick one, any one and you will be pleased -- juicy, cooked to order, with an abundance of toppings. GL also has fabulous salads in various sizes to satisfy any size appetite. And any appetizer would fill you up as a single meal!   I particularly love their brunch menu, as they make a mean omelet, and I'm a fanatic when it comes to how my eggs are cooked!  Grand Lux and grand shopping -- a perfect day at the mall!

This was our second time to Roka Akor and it was just a great as the first.  I don't know why we waited so long to go back . . . maybe because it is a little further from home than some of our other Japanese/Sushi hangouts.    We went during restaurant week. The special menu was lovely -- and that was what my hubby chose. His Butterfish Tataki with Yuzu-Shallot Dressing was heavenly. The Ribeye with Wafu and Garlic Chips was delicate - no knife needed.  And the dessert of Exotic Fruit and House-Made Mango Sorbet was so colorful and delicious, and so pretty, it looked like it should stay just put!  When I saw the Yuzu Miso Marinated Black Cod with Pickled Red Onions on the menu, I said "no thank you" to the Restaurant Week menu.  OMG, it was divine. Black cod is almost a delicacy . . . we've try to replicate this dish at home . . . no way. All the meals came with the side of Japanese Wild Mushroom Rice Hotpot. I've never quite tasted anything like it.  It's similar to wild mushroom risotto, only better and more flavorful. Since we were celebrating my birthday, they served up a freebie of baked green tea custard. It was uniquely refreshing and the perfect end to a delectable meal!  Service was spot on . . . just attentive enough without smothering. The space itself is beautifully designed with various different areas to sit in according to your mood.  The atmosphere is upscale, along with the prices, but don't let that deter you from going.  You can make it a special occasion restaurant!

I would never have picked a museum cafe for lunch, even though it is practically in my own backyard, but with my friend's endless ravings about their Dreamcatcher Salad, I relented.  And I'm glad I did!  It's now become a staple for lunch meetings!  The dining area is bright and cheerful, but the outdoor patio is truly a delight on a beautiful day!  It is serene and is surrounded by a plethora of desert plants and a lovely water feature.  The menu is rather short on items, but long on freshness and flavor.  Many of the offerings lean towards Southwestern style.  I have found my favorites on the menu, in particular, the Hummus Veggie Wrap which is filled to the brim in a healthy spinach tortilla with Tepary bean hummus, tomatoes, roasted red bell pepper, grilled red onions, pepitas, smoked gouda, and romaine.  (I've tried to duplicate this wrap at home with underwhelming success!)  Each sandwich comes with the choice of salad or chips. The portions are hearty.  The service is attentive, but not intrusive.  An absolutely divine dine!

Overpriced, yes! But like other reviewers have said, it's Vegas, it's Bellagio, and OMG, what an incredible view if you're fortunate enough to sit by the windows facing the exquisite fountains or on the outside patio! Unfortunately, we weren't sitting there, but we had a huge booth, big enough for six, all to ourselves, just two of us!  Service was good, not over the top.  Our waiter was a great photographer, so he gets kudos for the most excellent picture he took!   The specialty drinks are stunning and creative in presentation, heavy on the alcohol by my standards, but expensive - $20 for one martini!  Loved the Lychee martini!  The food is fresh, inspired, and pretty!  We had the Big Eye Tuna Pizza.  I could have eaten two of them by myself.  It really isn't a pizza at all, but an artfully covered cracker with plenty of tuna accented by shiso and truffle oil. To get my daily dose of veggies, we ordered the grilled eggplant skewers which were covered in miso and sesame. It was sweet and good enough for dessert.  We had to try the Popping Spicy Crab Roll, the claim to fame being the addition of pop rocks (remember those?) amongst a more traditional crab, asparagus and cucumber roll.  We were expecting an explosion of sorts on our mouths but it was actually very subtle and sweet on the finish. It didn't wow us like we thought it would, but it was still a delicious roll.  Yellowtail is really all about the combination of atmosphere, service and food, and it was a great experience!  Next time, we might try sitting in the lounge area that faces the casino as you get a prime spot for people watching as the throngs of people come through Via Bellagio! That's entertainment!

I had never been to the Herb Box for breakfast before; in fact, it wasn't even on my radar until I did a little more digging for a nice (not chain) breakfast place in N. Scottsdale near Grayhawk. We were meeting some friends from out-of-town and wanted some good food with great atmosphere. Having had scrumptious lunches and dinners here before, it was an easy decision.  Since there were six of us, and the forecasters were calling for ugly weather, I had the foresight to make reservations for a table so that we wouldn't have to wait. Moments after we arrived, the place was practically full!  Our server was a gem and so patient as she easily picked up on the fact that we all had lots to talk about, so she gave us plenty of time to order. We were already on our second mug of coffee by the time we ordered!!!  The menu is not extensive for breakfast, but there were so many different types of items, I had a hard time making up my mind. I saw a gentleman seated at a table next to us having what looked like an incredible sandwich . . . turned out to be a BLT on brioche (with eggs). That's what I ordered . . . couldn't resist. Neither could my friend. This was a truly beautiful sandwich with the egg cooked perfectly, the bacon crispy, the tomato and arugula fresh, the goat cheese so creamy, and dressed with an amazing aioli that had a slight kick to it.  The guys at the other end of the table ordered a side of potatoes which was enormous and came with the same aioli . . . yum!!!!   The only near-miss, and they rectified it before we could say anything, was that they forgot to put the cheese on the side of my friend's BLT so they had to remake it, so she had a little extra wait before they brought her meal out.   I am never disappointed at the Herb Box. The food is always top notch and the service always attentive. I have to move it to the top of my list for breakfast!

It's good times when you're sitting on the patio of North people watching on a gorgeous day, and it's even better when you're eating some delicious Italian cuisine. I have never had even a so-so experience at North . . . the service, the food, the ambiance have always been consistently above par, sometimes even excellent, depending upon the time of day dining. The food is always fresh, then menu always has something for every possible craving or desire . . . salads, sandwiches, pizzas, entrees.   Two couples sitting across from us had two pizzas, and as they saw me perusing the menu, they held up a slice and exclaimed "you can't go wrong with the pizza!"  I am a huge fan of the thin-crust Neopolitan pizza, and North did not disappoint.  The crust was thin and crispy, the eggplant on top grilled to perfection, the onions caramelized but not soggy, and the portobello firm and tasty. My husband had the Angus burger, which was cooked medium rare to his specifications.  It was accompanied by a huge serving of pasta salad which rivaled the one I make at home that is his favorite (saddens me a bit, but nice to know that we can find a substitute when I'm not in the mood to mess up the kitchen . . .  )  You can always find a great class of wine by the glass, not too expensive either.  They pour a nice-sized glass.  When the weather permits, I always ask for patio seating. It is much more relaxed and quieter than sitting amongst the hubbub of the indoor dining areas.  The garden patio furniture along the far outside railing is prime seating, so comfortable that you could linger there for hours.  Hmm . . . today is another  ideal day . . . Look for us on the patio! :)

After driving by Cafe Bink on numerous occasions and noticing the lovely outdoor patio was packed, we decided to give it a try for dinner with some friends and family.  It was a beautiful day in North Scottsdale so we made reservations for a group of five (they don't take reservations for parties of 4 or less), and thought patio seating would be awesome. When we arrived that evening, the weather was cold, but we were assured that we would be cozy on the patio with the propane heaters, and they provided blankets to boot!    Our server was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and helped steer us to the special of the day, a veal tortellini, and numerous other dishes.  We ordered a large order of fries for the table, which came with three sauces.  The fries were crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  While I munched on a few with no sauce (they didn't need any), the consensus at the table was that the truffle ketchup was extraordinary.    I was excited to try the French Onion soup, one of my faves when done properly . . . and it was a good night for soup on the patio!  It was delicious . . . the onions sweet and the broth smooth.  The crouton was just enough to hold up the cheese.  I loved it so much, I could have ordered another for my entree!  Because we couldn't make up our minds, my step-daughter and I shared two different entrees - Bolognese with Creamy Polenta, and the Catfish. The Bolognese was hearty and complemented the smooth texture of the polenta.  The Catfish was perfectly cooked and accompanied by crunchy hush puppies.    Unfortunately, when food gets cold, it's not pleasant for anyone, and that evening was not the night to be dining al fresco on their patio.  Shortly into the meal, the propane tanks by our table were empty, and there was no replacement. In Cafe Bink's defense, I will say they were gracious and moved us inside when a table freed up, and comped us dessert for our trouble.  Also, we brought home doggie bags of my entrees and heated them up the next night, and even my husband agreed that having it hot made a huge difference!    We will certainly give Cafe Bink another try, but we will sit inside on the chilly evenings.

Since we moved to Scottsdale four years ago, we had been looking for a neighborhood Thai restaurant that we could go back to again and again, and we found it with Thai House.  The food is consistently good.  The servers are friendly and knowledgeable.  They never forget to ask you "how spicy" on a scale of 1 to 5.  The red curry is my favorite, and they don't mind making it without bell peppers for me.  I ask for some green beans or broccoli instead and they are always accommodating for me!  A huge thumbs up!!!!

This was the second time I went to Heart and Soul Cafe. I overheard a little conversation that the restaurant was sold, but that everything was going to stay the same. I had two wonderful experiences here, one with friends for lunch about a month ago, and the other last week. Both our servers were warm and attentive. The restaurant is really homey, except for the pretentious 1957 Chevy car booth, which we had to sit in just once for the experience. Interesting how people either love the car or hate it . . . True classic car aficionados can't believe that someone would actually do that to an otherwise glorious specimen!  Our lunches, both the first time and the second, were fresh, of good quality, and plentiful. There was no skimping on the sides of potatoes, or on the sandwiches or salads themselves. I do wish they would serve some breakfast items until later in the day, but it gives us another reason to go back.   Unlike some other reviewers, we found that we received great value for the price.  I hope with the new ownership that nothing changes. You know what they say, "If it ain't broke . . . "

4-1/2 stars for food . . . 2 stars for service.   I had no idea this place even existed . . . it is tucked away in a shopping center behind Pinnacle Peak in the Troon North area. I am so glad our friends recommended that we have dinner there. First of all, the dining room is really pretty. It reminded me of an old style Italian restaurant from back East in so many ways . . . and you would never know it from the outside.   The offered a summer special menu of $34.95 for a starter (appetizer, salad or soup), entree, dessert, and coffee -- a true bargain if you were to add everything up separately.   For starters, we all ordered something different . . . calamari fritti, mixed green salad with Gorgonzola, Prosciutto di Parma over fresh seasonal melon, and the beef carpaccio. All were a hit except my salad was pretty unremarkable and ordinary.   Entrees were AMAZING! All entrees (except pasta) come with a choice of side, either pasta or the daily veggie (green beans that night). Hubby had the Veal Martini (Veal cutlet breaded with parmesan cheese, sautéed in brown sauce and topped with asparagus). I had the Veal Parmigiana, as did one of our friends. The veal was so incredibly tender you could cut it with only your fork -- heavenly. For me, the veal parm hearkened back to the old days in the late 1960s and early 1970s when I was a kid in Pittsburgh, PA. We had a favorite restaurant that my family went to every Sunday called the Park Schenley. Perhaps I have romanticized my experience of it, but I always compare any veal parm to the one there, and Gianfranco didn't disappoint! BRAVO!! My other friend (another Yelper) had the Scampi Classico (I hope she will write a review too). The shrimp were huge and looked really succulent, but we were so busy chatting away, I didn't get a chance to ask her how it tasted. I am assuming because she finished it with no complaints that she was very pleased.   For dessert, hubby had the Tiramisu. It was a very hefty portion and he made no excuse for orgasmically moaning how delicious it was. I had the cannoli . . . it was just okay. The filling was a little too creamy for my taste. I like my cannoli heavy on the ricotta texture. Coffee was delicioso! I forgot to ask what kind they serve.   Service was a downer, to say the least. S-L-O-W. Our server apologized for the slow service and blamed it on the fact that the restaurant was closing for two weeks for summer vacation and everyone decided to come in that night . . . they weren't prepared for such a crowd. I have to wonder how that could be when we were one of the first tables seated and we were the last to leave, why that was . . . Believe me, we were not lingering . . . It seems that this is not unusual based on other reviewers comments.   Even still, the food (and the company) more than made up for the lack of service. We will definitely be regulars here, but we will make sure that if we are pressed for time (which fortunately we were not this particular night), we will let them know in advance.

If I had it in my heart to give a Starbucks a five-star review, this would be it. But in writing a review, I have to take into account the coffee product itself, and honestly, with our Jura machine at home, we get better coffee and espresso, and go figure --  we use Starbucks beans.  I'll chock it up to our grind and strength.  Having prefaced it by the above, this is probably the best Starbucks location I've visited. Even with ten people ahead of me in line, it was less than five minutes before I had my cafe latte and spinach, egg white and feta wrap in hand! The place was packed with nary an available seat inside, so I grabbed one of  the comfy outdoor patio seats. It was a perfect morning to linger over my drink while I waited for a friend to finish up at the dentist.   It's also great for people watching as just about everyone who works at Kierland Commons stops by for "whatever".  As an aside, it was the first time I tried the spinach, egg white and feta wrap, based on the recommendations of two young girls in line behind me, and ooh, it is by far the best "fast food" breakfast I have ever had!  Kudos to Starbucks for steering me clear of the former beloved Egg McMuffin!

I am the pickiest client of all time!  My nail tech "retired" to be an artist (she was extraordinary) and I had to find someone who could match her in talent.  It took me a couple of months and I finally heeded the advice of a dear trusted friend who told me that Martin of Shea Nails is the best!  She is right!  It took him no time to get the look I love down, and he is precision perfect when it comes to doing the whites of my pink and whites!  I have naturally ugly nails, like the illusion of a longer nail bed, and he "nailed it"!  Today I went in for my first pedicure there! OMG! It was truly one of the most relaxing experiences I have ever had. I asked for the works -- and it was worth every dime. It is much less expensive than the "high falootin" salons in N. Scottsdale, and they really do pamper you! The salon is clean, uncluttered, and very comfortable.  No rock music, no hairdryers, no women dressed to the nines who think they are God's gift.   To those who think they are always waiting, I suggest you take the first appointment in the morning or the last appointment of the day so that you can call ahead to see how they are running so you don't have to wait.

I love going to get my hair done at Boujis!  It is so welcoming. While the salon is current with all the latest styles and trends, you don't feel put off by attitude. Dona, the owner, always greets you with a smile and knows you by name.    One of my favorite things about Boujis is that they do not let clients walk back on a whim to talk to the stylists and interrupt them while they work.  My time is my time!  Okay, call me selfish, but I like having the undivided attention of Ainslie when she is working her magic on my hair!    The other thing I love about Boujis is that the salon is light and bright, so when Ainslie colors my hair, we're looking at it with natural light, not the artificial light mimiced in many salons these days.  Speaking of Ainslie, I give her an A+.  I am a pretty easy client, and I like to change up my look, but when my hair doesn't need color, and I insist that I want it, she does not give in! She truly cares not only about the look she creates, but also the health of your hair.

I've been a huge fan of Jean Georges for years beginning with Prime at Bellagio, followed by Market in Paris. In Las Vegas, we used to go at least once each trip we made there. With so many new restaurants popping up in Sin City, we've chosen to try others, but after our dinner at J & G Steakhouse at the Phoenician, I think next time we go back to LV, we'll have to make a reservation at Prime. The menus are very similar, in JG's typical French-Asian inspired steakhouse.   First of all, the restaurant space is just gorgeous . . . and its location atop the Phoenician is a perfect setting for twinkling city views. Patio dining in the premium months alone would make it worth the price of admission. I particularly love the semicircle booths that ring the main dining room. We opted for seats by the window, and really enjoyed the "corner" like booth we shared. It was our 22nd wedding anniversary, which I let them know by reservation through "Open Table", and we were greeted warmly by the hostess acknowledging our celebration, as did our waiter, the restaurant manager, and just about everyone who served us at our table. It was lovely.  Our server Brian was delightful . . . very unassuming, friendly and informative. He was very helpful in offering suggestions, highlighting favorites, and not overselling, which I find to be a real drag at many other finer dining establishments. The one thing I found incongruous in the entire setting was the "butcher paper" place mats. They just seemed so out of place for this elegant establishment.  To start, my hubby ordered a half-bottle of Mount Veeder Cabernet. Neither of us are big drinkers, and the fact that J & G had a pretty extensive list of half-bottles was a real treat! It was full bodied and delicious, and just a perfect amount to see us through our dinner.    My husband ordered a sampling of the days selection of oysters on the half-shell.  All were perfectly shucked, but the Blue Points were supremely meaty with a little salty finish. For starters my husband ordered the wildly popular Tuna Tartare. The tuna was so light and fresh and melded well with the bed of avocado and ginger marinade. I opted for the Butternut Squash soup, a favorite of mine at Prime as well. It was just how I remembered. The oyster mushrooms come in the bottom of the bowl, and the attendant then pours the soup over it . . . it is so creamy, a little sweet, a little savory. I would have licked the bowl had I not been in a public room. Yum!  Hubby splurged and chose the 16 ounce Six Peppercorn Prime NY Steak. He was on Cloud Nine. I totally forbid eating red meat at home, so when we dine out, I don't make a fuss if that's what he chooses. The steak came perfectly medium rare and it was accompanied by four sauces from which he could choose.  In order of preference, Béarnaise, Smoked Chili Glaze, J & G Steak Sauce and Black Pepper Condiment. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with Honshimeji Mushrooms in a Miso Yuzu Broth. It was to me an unusual preparation for Chilean Seabass, but was simply refreshing and clean with a bit of a citrus finish. Honestly, I could only finish half as I was so stuffed from the starters. In addition, we ordered two sides, the Caramelized Brussels Sprouts with Balsamic Vinegar and Pecans and the Potato Gratin with Comte. Both were great for sharing. The potato gratin was so rich, between the both of us, we could only eat half the order. Needless to say, we brought a little of everything home with us in a "doggie bag" and had it for lunch . . . and it was just as delicious warmed in the microwave now that the flavors had time to sit.  If you can believe, we saved room for dessert! For our anniversary we were treated to a free Raspberry and Rose Pavlova with crisp Meringue and raspberry sorbet. We also ordered the Warm Chocolate Cake with caramel ice cream. Hubby loved the Pavlova the best and pretty much consumed it all before I could even get a good taste. He was on a major sugar high. I had a couple of bites of the warm chocolate cake and was blown away by the texture of the cake with its warm bittersweet chocolate center. I was in chocolate heaven. The caramel ice cream was a perfect pairing. Some of the best ice cream I have tasted in eons.  As we left, we were both in our "tummy full, nap now" mode . . . very sated with the atmosphere, service and cuisine!

I love Babaganoush, and it's been hard to find  some that is traditional, smoky and not overly seasoned. And now, with Pita Jungle,  I have a place to satisfy my cravings fairly close to home! I can't believe in all the years we've lived here, I haven't been to a single Pita Jungle. I actually thought it was more of a fast food place, order at the counter, rush, rush, rush.  I have never been so happy to be so wrong!  Honestly, everything we had for lunch was fantastic! Hubby had an ahi salad which was sublime with the ahi seared to perfection. I had the hummus and ahi. Simply divine.  I would never have put the two items together, but it worked for me -- two of my favorite foods on one plate. I agree with all the reviewers about the hummus here -- probably the creamiest I have ever had with a delightful flavor that I could pair with anything now.  I wanted some baba but didn't want to order an entire appetizer size, so our very helpful server brought out a side dish of it . . . yum! Had we not been heading to Costco for some groceries, I would have taken some to go!  The seating options are many - dine inside at a table, banquet or communal high top, or dine al fresco. You couldn't miss sitting in any of those locations, although, if you want a little more quiet, I'd recommend sitting on the patio. Service was great and you could see that the managers were watching with a close eye.  There will be many meals, both eat in and takeout, in our future with Pita Jungle.

This is the only place for donuts in the valley.  A friend of mine who drives by Lamar's on her way to work, picked some up for the office.  I just happened to be in her office that day.  I usually don't eat donuts, but they were so temping . . . large, fresh, fragrant in the box.  I couldn't resist.  The assortment was overwhelming but I managed to pluck out an apple fritter which was the size of a dinner plate.   It was the best I ever had . . . The next week, I asked her to pick me up an assortment on her way to work, and I'd stop by . . . I couldn't wait to try the Bavarian filled Bizmark, and when I bit into it, every bite was filled with the luscious creme.  I ordered a dozen and ended up making a little tour of North Scottsdale, dropping a quarter one of this and a quarter one of that for my friends and family to partake of the calorie-laden but oh so scrumptious delights.

I had some serious doubts about this restaurant when friends suggested it. I am in no way a sushi snob, but I have to admit that I have had my share of bad experiences at the larger chain restaurants that serve sushi. I'm not sure what all the negativity is about, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Does it stack up against my go-to favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale . . . Ah-No. Having said that, Ah-So still delivered on some fresh melt-in-your-mouth sushi that satisfied this demanding sushi lover.  The space is cavernous . . . very large, with modern decor. Tables were nicely spread out in the center while one side was lined with very spacious booths, the other wish a sushi bar and the far wall with teppanyaki tables. First a first-timer, teppanyaki tables are fun, but don't really work for conversations. It is really a show. For us, we had a table smack in the center. I am not a fan of being in the middle of a large space, but it was not cramped and actually quite comfortable. On a Saturday night, the space was not overly loud and we could still use our "indoor" voices and hear one another.  We had a fantastic server who I put to the test three times with my drink order. So, I have a particular mixture I like, and was quite specific. The first time he brought my drink out, it was way too sweet so I sent it back. The second time, for some reason it had soda in it, which wasn't in the list, and send that back as well (I don't do anything carbonated). Before he brought back another, he had the bartender come to the table to ask again. She was a doll, and brought back a perfect drink for me! I was impressed that our server didn't get rattled by my being so picky!  My other dining companions all had the teppanyaki dinners, and it was quite the serving, with soup, salad, a huge mound of rice and veggies, and their protein. The jumbo scallops were really jumbo. My only complaint in the food department is the soup -- bland, bland, bland. Otherwise, even the salad made of mostly iceberg lettuce was good when mixed with their tasty dressing.  A few more words about my sushi and sashimi plate . . . for $25 I also had soup and salad, but when they brought the plate, my eyes bulged out of my head! It was huge . . . enough for three people, at least. Seven pieces of tuna, yellowtail and salmon sashimi, seven pieces of of sushi, and eight pieces of spicy tuna roll!  You certainly get your money's worth here.  All in all, it was a way better than average dining experience. If you are not a sushi snob and live in the area, you will be very happy!

What a disappointment! We usually have breakfast/brunch at Cafe Bellagio, but decided to head over to check out the Aria Cafe for a change of pace, and what a change it was!  If you want comfortable and warm surroundings, great coffee and impeccable service, Aria Cafe is not the place to go.   In a huge cavernous room with soaring ceilings and glass walls, it is hard to sit back and relax. The room echoed so loudly that I could barely hear my husband talk across a small table!   The menu was similar to Cafe Bellagio, but the food was not on par. My omelet was overcooked and my husband's salad looked like it had been sitting on a shelf for days. They did one thing right . . . I like my french fries almost burnt, and I asked for them that way. Given the rest of the meal, I am not sure that honored my wishes, or they just came that way?!  Service was so-so, and should have been spot on for the prices they charge!  Needless to say, we won't be going back to Aria Cafe.

I could never imagine myself eating fried chicken and waffles -- not for breakfast, not for lunch, not for dinner . . . but hubby and I were looking for a quick bite (not drive-thru or fast food) on our way back from south Scottsdale.  As I tend to do often these days, I picked up my cell phone, clicked on Yelp and looked for something with great ratings nearby.  Up popped Lolo's.  This worked as hubby wanted something breakfasty and I wanted something more lunchable.  When I think of fried chicken, all I would think of is KFC -- greasy, ordinary batter, yuck!  I was thinking, I better get a waffle and some eggs, or the macaroni, but then our darling waitress (who by the way told me I have beautiful eyes) said, "I promise you, you'll love the chicken, which would you like, white or dark meat?"  I picked the drumsticks . . . oooh, and I am a convert!  Absolutely delicious steaming hot drumsticks with a perfect coating of perfectly seasoned batter.  My husband loved his breast and wings equally.   There are so many choices on the menu, and not just chicken, so even if you are a vegetarian, you can still find something like beans and rice on the menu, or on their list of sides which is enormous.   The atmosphere is very casual and open . . . and the people are very friendly, which makes it even better. Gotta go back and get some mac 'n cheese since it looked like everyone except us was ordering it!

Breakfast at the Rustic Cafe - what a treat! Sweet little place on Cave Creek and the 101, but never noticed it before. Based on the reviews here on Yelp, I had no real expectations so I was completely surprised when we had a most delightful breakfast.   Nice menu with lots of options. Hubby had the Breakfast Changa. He was in Seventh Heaven. This is a huge burrito filled with eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, and cheese, then fried. I can't believe he ate the whole thing. I ordered the spinach and mushroom omelet and it was just perfect. I am "Sally" when it comes to ordering eggs, and I'm difficult to please. I was thrilled when my omelet actually arrived on the soft side and the hash browns came they way I ordered - almost burnt.   Our server was very pleasant, as was the rest of the staff . . . I would have given Rustic Cafe 5 stars except for one thing -- they serve their toast with Country Crock (not real butter). I should probably have asked if they have real butter, just when they brought flavored coffee creamer, I asked for plain and they graciously provided me with it.   We'll be back soon!

I sure didn't feel like I was dining in a shopping center even tho' it was in the tony Scottsdale Fashion Square. The decor is so beautiful . . . maybe a little over the top for its location.  We were practically the only people in the restaurant except another couple with a screaming toddler.  Service was excellent, and I feel that even if the restaurant was packed to the gills, service would still have been attentive and spot on.  The food was delicious. I ordered the Modern Club Sandwich with Turkey, Smoked Ham, Bacon, and Havarti. You're probably thinking . . . how could anyone mess up a club sandwich . . . well, they can, but this wasn't the case. The bread was toasted perfectly, accompanied by fresh lettuce, and the sandwich was not overdressed.  Not a soggy bite in the bunch . . . the makings of a really fine club.  My dining partner had the Kobe burger and he was loving every juicy bite!  The french fries came out crispy and yummy.  It had been quite some time since we dined at Modern Steak (it was just after it opened). That time, we had a beautiful meal, too, which makes me wonder why we hadn't been back in so long. It's got to be something about the location . . . in a mall. Yeah, that's it . . . I remember now . . . a little pricey meal in beautiful surroundings becomes a shop til you drop adventure!!

Maybe I am just getting pickier with each review and less generous with my stars, but I am trying to figure out why the previous reviewers raved so much about Culinary Dropout.  There are certainly things to love . . . the expansive outdoor patio with some of the most comfortable seating around. It's great for people-watching as it fronts Camelback Road, just across the street from Scottsdale Fashion Square. On a hot and hazy summer afternoon, we were still very content sitting on the patio.  On the negative side . . . The food was not even so-so.  I expected so much more from a Sam Fax Restaurant. We have been fans for years with True Food, North, The Greenhouse and the now-closed Bloom, and they are on our regular dining rotation.  Culinary Dropout was how its name sounded, someone dropped the culinary part when they made our meals. I had a hard time finding something that even sounded appetizing on the menu!  We started with the potato chips and onion dip. Nothing to write home about, although I think that if I had a real salt craving, these might just satisfy it. Maybe I should have ordered the pretzel and provolone fondue . . .   For an entree I ordered the ricotta gnocchi with sausage and mushroom . . . sure sounded like a winner . . . NOT! The gnocchi and sauce were pretty tasteless, and the mushrooms and sausage were so salty I couldn't eat them. Mix them all together and it tasted even worse. My husband ordered the Beef Stroganoff and was very disappointed.  There was no sour cream taste whatsoever. Boring was what he called it.  So the food is not up to par with the rest of the Fox restaurants, but the worst part was the service. The place was pretty empty, and while our server was attentive to our needs prior to our order, after our food was delivered, he pretty much disappeared -- no water refills, no iced tea refills . . . nothing. On a 106 degree day, that should never happen on the patio!!  Needless to say, we won't be making any trips back to Culinary Dropout!

What is there to say about Mastro's Ocean Club that has not already been said? It's funny . . . we live in Scottsdale, home of the original Mastro's and Mastro's Ocean Club, and yet, this is where we decided to dine in Las Vegas. Having never been to Mastro's Ocean Club in Scottsdale, but knowing friends far and wide have been so delighted there, we thought on our vacation, we should give the sister restaurant a try! We are so glad we did!  The space itself is very unique in design. We were seated in the "Tree House". It is quite a spectacle from inside as well as outside as the wood towers from the lower level of the Crystals shopping center to the very top with a rounded platform area, that kind of resembles an open wooden spaceship, within which is the dining room seating. It is very light and airy. There is plenty of room between tables and despite some of other reviewers complaints that the music is loud, we had no problem with it, even on a Friday night.  Our waiter (I think his name is Robert) was one of the best servers we have ever had, in just about any restaurant in which we have dined. He was knowledgeable, friendly, didn't hover, and was not pushy at all. He gave us time to order, time in between courses, time to finish the humongous plates of food.  The rest of the waitstaff was also attentive. Having sat outside at the pool all day, my husband was parched, and I think he drank at least eight glasses of water . . . he never had to wait for the glass to be refilled! When I couldn't finish a course, the attendant asked if he could wrap the remaining up to go. I didn't have to flag anyone down.  The food was top notch, bar none!  We started with the ahi tuna tartare. It was a massive appetizer of tiny cubed ahi piled above avocado and what I believe were panko chips. Fresh, flavorful and enough for a table of four (not two) to share! Not knowing how large the portion was going to be, we also ordered an Ocean Club Salad to split - fabulous! And, huge! It had chopped egg, onion, shrimp, lobster, blue cheese . . . you could eat one as a meal. At that point, I issued a proclamation to my husband, aside from our main entrees, we could only order ONE side. Hubby ordered the bone-in rib eye . . . a hunka hunka burnin' love of meat, perfectly seasoned, perfectly seared to medium rare. Bliss for my hubby who gets no red meat at home!  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass Oreganata . . . melted in my mouth . . . and, it too was a giant piece of fish! I couldn't even finish it. The twice baked potato was delish, even luke warm, as we couldn't even finish it during our meal, but instead had it as a midnight snack back in our hotel room!    One other note . . . and this was pure genius. I couldn't finish my wine. If I put anything more into my stomach, I think I would have exploded! Our waiter said on the way out, take my drink to the hostess and she will give it to me to go. Apparently, the hostess can do this, but the waiter can't. Thinking I am going to get my wine in a plastic cup . . . the hostess actually poured it into another wine glass and told me to keep it!   Without a doubt, this was the best meal we had in Vegas over this three-day holiday. And despite what some would say is a hefty price tag, I beg to differ. The quality of the service and food were spot on. We had dinner at two other similarly priced restaurants and left feeling robbed. Not so at Mastro's Ocean Club.   I think I have finally convinced my husband to make the Scottsdale Mastro's Ocean Club on our regular rotation for fine dining . . . I hope it lives up to the Las Vegas outlet!

You don't want to shop at Tiffany or Cartier . . . you'll get what everyone else gets, even though it's a name brand. A special piece of jewelry should be just that . . . and created for you by someone who "gets" who you are, and gives you the opportunity to play a big part in your own design.   I met Scott, the owner of Addison Taylor Fine Jewelry, through another jeweler who referred me to him for an appraisal of my mother's diamond ring. When I went up in the elevator and rang the doorbell, it hearkened back to the jewelers in NYC or other East Coast metro areas. It was a long time since I rang a buzzer for entry!!!   Scott is amazing! He is so welcoming and open. He's a good listener and also a great story teller. He gets to know you and you also get to know him. He asks questions. You immediately feel like he's a part of your family, and you a part of his. Together, we created the most beautiful setting for my mother's diamond ring, and at his suggestion we took the old setting which had ballerina set diamonds and made it look up to date and new by setting it with a large center black diamond. Stunning! His idea! I get so many compliments on both of them.   Scott's showroom is full of amazing jewelry, including some extraordinary watches. What he carries runs the gamut, from wallet friendly to off the hook expensive! I am always excited to see what he has in store! He also carries an ample supply of men's jewelry, so don't feel awkward dragging your male friend or significant other to see him . . . believe me, he will not want to leave empty-handed!   When you want something special, Addison Taylor Fine Jewelry is the place to go!

There is not much I can say that hasn't already been said about the MIM. I am absolutely the anti-museum girl, and yet I found myself feeling almost child-like inside this wonderland of instruments and music.   The space is stunning and bright; exhibits flow naturally from theme to theme on the first floor and then regionally upstairs. We spent about three or so hours there and barely scratched the surface of the first floor.   Admittedly, we took a break for lunch in the cafe which by the way was delicious. This is not your standard cafeteria fare. It can please all palates, from pure decadent to strict vegan. My turkey burger was moist and flavorful, and the accompanying eggplant fries were yummy!   Some of my favorite highlights . . . John Lennon's upright piano, Eric Clapton's guitar, the Steinway piano exhibit which shows how they are made, and then the xorgan.   The MIM is worth your time . . . probably time and time again. I can't wait to go back and spend time on the second floor (world regions) and then spend some additional time on the first floor playing some obscure instruments in the Experience Gallery . . . a real treat!

I was really surprised at how much I actually enjoyed this restaurant. We had just arrived in Las Vegas and we were starving with no dinner reservations. We hopped the train from Bellagio to Crystals at City Center and within minutes we were seated at a booth overlooking the cavernous Crystals bottom floor. What a treat! While we dined, we were treated to a quasi-flash mob of dancers as well as various duos of dancers performing modern and classical dances. Without a doubt, these are the most coveted seats in the restaurant!  There was no pretense at all at this "celebrity" outpost of the famed Wolfgang Puck. It was casual and comfortable, and the service was attentive but not overly so. We started with the calamari fritti which was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned. My husband had the Veal Scallopini. It arrived as an abundant plateful of succulent and tender veal 6covered in mushrooms and artichokes. My hubby, who has a huge appetite, was "complaining" he was full about half-way through his plate.  I had the Eggplant Parmesan which came with a side of Capellini Pasta. It, too, was a generous portion of delicious eggplant which was not overly breaded or greasy.  (I consider myself an eggplant parm connoisseur and order it whenever I see it on the menu.)  This one did not disappoint! Like my better half, I could barely get through half and was bummed that I had no place to heat it or store it back at the hotel to devour later.  What impressed me most, after the food and unexpected entertainment, was the modest bill. With all we ordered as well as a glass of wine and a martini, we didn't even hit $100, a feat I wish we could duplicate at other LV restaurants named for a famous chef!

I don't know if I could eat pizza anywhere else now!  This was the best of the best -- real Italian pizza, nothing at all like what we Americans have called pizza for a gazillion years.  How did this scrumptious pizza morph into Domino's, I do not know.  We went unexpectedly early afternoon on a Sunday.  We had a table right away, and didn't have to hunt for parking. The service was excellent with our delightful server offering up suggestions and favorites keeping in mind our likes and dislikes.    Being cheese lovers, we ordered the Quattro Formaggi.  The flavors of the cheeses melded with the crisp thin crust. I thought I was in heaven.  We also ordered the more traditional Diavola.  It was reminiscent of the pizza we had in Italy years ago.  The red sauce is delicioso.    What I like most about Pomo's pizza is that it is simple, fresh, and scrumptious.  No doubt that we will go back again and again.  "Lo amo."

I still love Pomo.  We tried a couple different pizzas this time.  Hubby had the one loaded with meat.  He devoured it.  I had the vegetarian with eggplant, zucchini and mushrooms (substitute for the bell peppers).  It was delicioso!  Usually when I eat pizza, I leave the crust, but the crust on these Neapolitana are too good not to eat!  I was totally impressed that our waitress, Michelle, remembered me!  Actually, I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but still impressive!  She was a sweetheart, by the way, so I highly recommend sitting in her section when the opportunity arises.   Would have loved to have been seated on the patio but they were full when we arrived at 2 pm on a Sunday.  After we were seated inside, two or three tables on the patio cleared.  I wonder why the hostess didn't say, it might be a few minutes wait if you want patio seating . . . she didn't even scan the area to see if there might be availability soon :(

Sam Fox is making money hand over fist at this gem of a spot. We arrived late by lunch standard mid-week and the place was packed to the gills.  It was a perfect day to sit on the patio. I loved the people watching . . . and dog watching. I wish we had brought ours with us. They, too, would have enjoyed it!  Service was excellent, even at such a busy time. We ordered some sides to start, zucchini fries and sweet potato fries.  The zukes were delicious, cooked in an ultra-lite batter and sprinkled with a little parmesan. The sweet potato fries were equally as good. Both were large portions!  Not a meat lover, I ordered the ahi sandwich minus the slaw and avocado and topped with braised onions and wild mushrooms. Absolutely splendid! My hubby ordered the Kobe burger, a nicely seasoned chunk of Kobe covered with cheddar cheese and wild mushrooms. The best he's had in a long, long time, he said.  I don't know where he put it, but my dear husband ordered the salted caramel shake. Wow is all I can say about the one "bite" I had . . . so thick and creamy . . . I was on Cloud Nine . . . and my husband was in a food coma afterwards! Yummy all the way around!

Sure, when it comes to painting the inside of your home, you want it to look good, but you also want to create an atmosphere.  Some like their home to be relaxing, some opulent, some understated. Why would anyone want to leave that kind of work to a handyman or nonprofessional?  This is YOUR home!  You paid good money for it!  D W Crandall's owner, Mike, and his crew made our recently purchased 16 year old home look brand new and changed the entire look from drab to fab!  He loves what he does, and you can tell.  He's attentive to every detail, offering suggestions from corner wraps to accent details.  He and his crew take the utmost care in providing professional service.  We are thrilled with the quality of work that we received.  And by the way, except for the new paint and atmosphere to go along with it, when they leave, you wouldn't even know they had been there!  We highly recommend D W Crandall Painting and thank them for a job well done!

It's all about the experience . . . the food, the atmosphere, the service. Amaro scores a home run! It's been on my list for months, but we never got around to it until it showed up as an Arizona Restaurant Week participant. I'm a picky eater and always have a hard time making up my mind as to what I want, but when I see a "fixed price" restaurant week menu that has multiple items that I'd order, I'm there!   We were greeted at 6 pm on Friday night by one of the owners, Tagan, who was the catalyst for what became a most remarkable dining experience. We were seated at a comfy booth, safely tucked away from the happy hour scene. Tagan then introduced us to Mauricio, a true Italian waiter (I think via NJ) with a "grande personalita" -- just what you would expect in Italy! I was surprised that when I ordered a special martini combo, Mauricio wasn't quite sure what it was I wanted, so he called over the bartender Frank, who also happens to be an owner as well, who made one of the best Vodka-Midori-Pineapple martinis ever, garnished with a maraschino cherry! Loved the personal attention, and it never ceased throughout the entire course of the meal. My husband and I really appreciate when owners really want to hear what their patrons think, and we engaged in wonderful conversation about food, wine, travel, etc. Okay, some people like not to be bothered during their meals, but we like to get to know the people and the places we go, especially if we are going to go back . . . the next night.   Amaro, as some have said before in their reviews, is not your typical pizzeria. The Vino Lounge atmosphere is more appropriate. Pizzeria and Vino Lounge are certainly oxymorons and conjure up completely polarizing images. That being said, the restaurant design itself is also an oxymoron with its spacious dining area and its cozy lounge area. But it all works. Friday night they had great live music . . . Oh Baby Baby Its a Wild World by Cat Stevens, one of my favorite songs . . . I'm showing my age . . .   The food . . . yum! My husband opted for the AZ Restaurant Week menu and kicked it off with the Calamari Croccante. The calamari aficionado he is, he was wowed. He loved the two accompanying sauces, one a marinara type, the other, a lemon caper sauce. I had the Kantak Chop salad . . . it is my new favorite dish . . . The melding of flavors and textures just made my tongue tingle! (When we went back the next night, we ordered both the Calamari and the Kantak again!) My husband's Chicken Parm was melt in your mouth delicious, and it was a huge portion, enough for two, maybe three people. I had a pizza with mushrooms, spinach and Tellegio cheese -- the crust was thin, bubbly, and cooked to perfection. I was so full from my Kantak chopped salad that I could only eat one piece. I took the rest home and had a couple of pieces for breakfast . . . honestly, it was better than the night before, maybe because the flavors had a chance to meld with each other. Loved it! For dessert, my hubby had the Tiramisu which he devoured while making orgasmic sounds with each bite.   When we returned on Saturday night, we were warmly greeted as if we were old friends. We asked to be seated in Mauricio's section . . . I think he was happy to see us again. He's now familiar with my ordering idiosyncrasies . . . Again, we had a delicious meal. Hubby had the Con Pollo Salsiccia Tagliatelle (black pepper pasta, chicken/provolone sausage, asparagus, roasted tomatoes, garlic/tomato pesto) and I had the Giardino (house-made fettuccini verde, garlic, shallots, grape tomatoes, scallions, broccolini, shaved parmesan, EVOO). Both pastas were incredibly fresh and perfectly seasoned. (FYI, there is no salt or pepper on the table, for good reason, nothing needed it!) The portions are quite ample and I ended taking more than half of my pasta home. My step-daughter ordered the Pollo Carciofo pizza with house-pulled mozzarella, parmesan, basil pesto, wood fired chicken breast, marinated artichokes, extra virgin olive oil, basil. She loved it . . . and I loved it even more when I had pizza for breakfast the next morning . . . ooh la la! Lastly, we ordered the Panna Cotta for dessert. It was scrumptious - one of the best desserts I've tasted in eons. It was purely decadent and sinful . . . and definitely not on my food plan.   I've read where some reviewers have said the wine list begs for better wines. My husband didn't find that to be the case and had a difficult time deciding between some great options. He ultimately chose the Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc and was very pleased.   If there was anything negative at all to say about Amaro, it would be the lack of an outside patio, a subject upon our first arrival that became quite the joke.   We are definitely hooked on Amaro . . . it has the whole package, and it's almost in our back yard! Buon Appetito!

A beautiful Friday afternoon at the Biltmore Fashion Park . . . we're hungry! Do we go for decadence at the Cheesecake Factory or healthy food at True Foods . . . aah, we spot Seasons 52, and I look it up on Yelp! Great reviews so we decided to give it a whirl!   The patio, although small, was just perfect . . . intimate and comfortable. It is set away from the parking lot, so you don't feel like you are at a big shopping center patio with cars and fumes passing by.   I love that every menu item is under 475 calories, and they all sound interesting. My dining companion ordered the Farmer's Market Vegetable Plate with spring snap peas, grilled ponzu tofu and toasted almond tabbouleh. The tofu was yum! Even more yum was the tabbouleh with its mildly sweet taste. I could have eaten that just as my meal. I ordered the day's special flatbread -- Smoked Scottish Salmon with creme fresch. It was delicious and huge. I don't know how it came in under 475 calories, but if they say so, who am I to question it. The flatbread is about 5 x 13, plenty to share, so I ended up just eating the smoked salmon and leaving a good portion of the flatbread.   The service we received was outstanding! Our waiter was very patient with me as it takes me a long time to make up my mind, especially when I haven't had a chance to peruse a menu in advance of going somewhere. I'm always the one who says, "take everyone else's order first and come back to me" and often, I still haven't made up my mind . . .   As much as it pains my wallet to have to go to Biltmore Fashion Park to shop (hee hee hee), I think I can now find another reason to head in that direction. More importantly, I will have to find someone to go with me who will share one or two of their Mini Indulgences for dessert, but again, I'll have a hard time making up my mind which flavor. Aah, if life's problems were only that simple!   Bon Appetit!

This is the real deal!   Having traveled to Thailand and having lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, let me just say that the reality is Thai restaurants in the valley were lacking in authenticity. Sure, I could find some neighborhood Thai joints that satisfied my craving for the sweet and spicy flavors of Thailand, but it wasn't until I had dinner last night at Soi 4 that I remembered what Thai food really tastes like!   Don't be put off by the upscale location and mod decor. That's not reflected in the prices!   Once we were seated, Dee, the owner, came to greet us, explained the menu and answered our questions. She was absolutely delightful as she pointed out their specialties. It is such a rarity that the owner takes the time to introduce him or herself, that we were impressed from the start.   A must . . . the sauteed steamed turnip cake with egg, bean sprouts, and chives served with Sriracha sauce on the side (kanom pak gard). Had we not had the guidance of Dee, we most certainly would have passed this up on the appetizer menu. Wow! An explosion of flavors -- sweet, spicy, textured. I could make a meal on this alone. The Golden pouches of crab and pork served with sweet Thai dipping (toong tong) are a home run, too.   We ordered two salads, both of which were fresh, scented, and full of flavor. They can easily be shared by two or three people. The Grilled eggplant salad with minced chicken & prawns topped with lime, coconut dressing (yum makuer yao) is my new favorite salad. I'm a huge fan of eggplant, although I recently learned it has very little nutrition content :(   We all wanted the Pad Thai as our entree, so we ordered two. It hearkened back to the Pad Thai we had throughout our trip to Thailand a few years back, when I was surprised to learn that real Pad Thai was not orangey-red and covered with peanuts!   Just a few comments about the cocktails -- top notch! I had the Full Moon (Ginger vodka, pear nectar and cranberry) which was full of grating of real ginger - amazing! My husband had the Mango Cosmo which he thought was equally as good.   Service was so-so, but I have to overlook that on this occasion because Soi 4 has been open less than a month and it appeared that some of the staff was just learning the ropes and didn't quite have the menu down. They were otherwise pleasant and patient, gave us plenty of time to just sit and chat before ordering.   I can't wait to go back to try some of the other small plate and entree dishes. This won't disappoint! "khorb khun" for a yummy dining experience!

We were on a mission . . . to check out the space for a possible 18-guest dinner on a Saturday evening in March. We were excited as it was the most perfect day to enjoy the patio at True Food Kitchen. Apparently, everyone else had the same idea! What we didn't expect was that at 12:15 pm on a Friday afternoon, the wait for a table for two would be 40-45 minutes! Yikes! So we decided to not put our name down and try somewhere else . . . but before we left, we scoped out the building and patio. On the far end, the side with the really picturesque view of the mountains and the fountains (no streets), was a near "lounge" area with large comfy patio like chairs and low cocktail tables. I made a beeline to the hostess and asked if they were reserved or available . . . she said "the table is a little low . . . " We said, "no worries." We had our seats and we were ecstatic!!!!   And our experience continued to get better the longer we lingered. The patio area is much more conducive to talking . . . inside, it is very loud, and it would be difficult to carry on leisurely lunch (or dinner) and good conversation. My friend commented how nice it is to go out to eat and feel like you are doing something healthy for yourself. That is the foundation of True Food Kitchen and we likey!!!!   The menu offers so many wonderful choices to nourish your body. Their refreshing nonalcoholic elixirs were calling my name, so I had the Green Arnie which was perfectly sweetened with honey. They also have a beautiful selection of hot teas not usually found in most restaurants, and they serve it with honey as well. (Not a Splenda in sight!)   For our entrees, my friend chose the Panang Curry with Tofu. I was skeptical (having visited Thailand with the real deal). It is a large portion filled with a plentiful amount of tofu and veggies. The tofu was cooked to perfection so that the fragrant and delicious sauce clung to it just so. Yes, I tasted it -- I couldn't help it -- my friend was inhaling it at a vigorous pace! I ordered the Spaghetti Squash Casserole. It was delicioso. The squash and zucchini maintained a little of their crunchy vegetable texture, the tomato sauce was smooth and not too tangy, and it was just perfectly topped with just the right amount of slightly browned mozzarella cheese.   What I loved was that our server, while attentive, was not in the least bit smothering. On such a busy afternoon, she was gracious when we asked for more time to order; she offered my friend more hot water for her tea; and didn't rush us to leave and turn the space when we concluded our entrees . . . she gave us the opportunity to linger . . . and so we did.   No doubt that we will be back again and again. And I'm pretty sure my friend will be booking her 18-guest dinner there, too!

April is an artist extraordinaire . . . and she is quickly climbing the ladder as a topnotch pet portrait artist in the area. She has a keen sense of color and texture, but more importantly, she captures the essence and inimitable characteristics of each animal she paints.   Typically once a month, you can watch her in her element doing quick renderings of pets on the patio of Press Coffee at City North. On her first outing at Press, I brought our cockapoo Bella for a rendering. It looks like April spent hours painting her, especially Bella's gorgeous eyes which are her most expressive feature.   April is a supporter of most pet causes, often volunteering her time and services to pet charities in the Phoenix area.   With the holidays approaching, you won't have to look far to get a one-of-a-kind special gift for your family and friends!!!!

We went on Christmas Day to see The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I loved that we could order and choose our seats on line, even the type of theater, as it was showing on two screens. This is my first experience at one of the new "ultra" "luxe" theaters, so I have no real basis to which I can compare it.    I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the seats in the "Star" theater were. They are a tiny bit stiff, but so much better than traditional theater seats. It would be even better if they reclined with foot rests or had foot rests that could be moved out from under the seat to have that true "lay back and watch a movie" feel. I didn't in the least miss the pillows and blankets that some other theaters tout, just for the sake of germs, cleanliness, etc.  You just don't know.  The screen and sound quality were spot on . . . and the fact that you can order from a real server by pressing a little button is a great feature.  If I had been hungry, I probably would have ordered something from the diverse menu.  It was also nice that the theater had comfortable chairs while you wait to be ushered into your theater.  That's a really nice touch.  Oh, how I hate to queue up in a snaked line and wait and wait.  That was a real plus!  The bathrooms were completely designed with germophobes like me in mind.  There are buttons you press to get in and out of the door, so you can just use your elbow or another part of your body instead of your bare hands.  Toilets automatically flush (mine was a little slow), and they have the Dyson hand dryers - my fave! Then you just nudge another button to get out!  This is definitely on our list for our next movie if they're featuring a show we want to see!  Good job UltraStar!

We're always seeking out yummy dining spots north of the 101 in Scottsdale, and we've found a winner!  Although this part of the patio faces nothing but the parking lot, it was a beautiful evening and just perfect for dining al fresco.  The Drunk Bread (crusty bread soaked in white wine + melted gruyère cheese) is AMAZING! We could have had one order per person.  Sharing with three other people -- well, it wasn't enough.  This is the most delicious starter hubby and I have experienced in eons, five-star restaurants included.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  It's served piping hot in a cast iron skillet . . . so delectable!  Entrees were delicious as well.  Our waiter was right on the money when I asked him what the most popular dish is  . . .  the Papardelle Bolognese was so flavorful with huge bits of veal, beef and pork in a light red sauce.  The portion was bountiful!  Hubby and a friend had the Steak Fritte (hangar steak) and french fries.  It was buttery and so tender, especially for hangar steak, you could almost cut it without a knife. The other diner had the spaghetti al crudo - tomato, olives, capers, anchovies + garlic - and she enjoyed every bite.  They even made it with whole wheat pasta at her request.  They are happy to do this as long as you understand that it takes about 20 minutes longer than usual.  Service was good, not superior, but definitely above average. No rushing, no hovering.  The only glitch was that I was looking forward to having the fig and vanilla bean bellini (minus the champagne plus vodka) and they were out of fig :(  Since we were celebrating two birthdays, they brought us two desserts on the house.  My hubby and friends were in Seventh Heaven with the bread pudding while I loved the chocolate mocha like mousse concoction. We were more than full when we finished.  There are so many tantalizing items on the menu -- lots of pastas, pizzas, salad and more hefty options - that we have to go back for more.  I am thrilled to have Local Bistro truly local for me!  Buon Appetito!

I can't believe it took me so long to try this wonderful little gem tucked away in a strip mall across the street from Desert Ridge!   It was the perfect afternoon for dining al fresco. My dining companion had been there before so she knew what she wanted right away. I had a hard time deciding between breakfast and lunch (they serve breakfast until 2:30). Everything on the menu is organic, and they have gluten free options as well. All I knew was that whatever I chose for an entree, I had to get the sweet potato tots on the side. My co-Yelpers . . . you are so right! The tots arrived fresh and hot . . . I was so excited to try one, I burnt my mouth on the first. OMG, they were so divine . . . sweet, crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside. You could easily order these for dessert!  For an entree I had the veggie omelet. I didn't even have to tell them I liked my omelet on the light side, not overcooked. It was splendid! I also loved the fact they the didn't butter my rye toast!   My girlfriend ordered the summer rolls which she loved, and the hummus. The hummus came with a huge plate of pita, not the typical little serving you get at some restaurants. I tentatively tasted the cilantro hummus (I sometimes like cilantro and sometimes don't), and I was pleasantly surprised at how the flavors worked so well together. Who would have thunK?   As I watched other orders being delivered to tables, I couldn't help but notice the gigantic hamburger and the huge salads. I will definitely be suggesting Tryst as a regular meeting place for lunch, as there are so many items on the menu I still want to try.  Service was very good. Our server was actually quite unobtrusive, but still expedient. Unlike some reviewers, I didn't find Tryst to be overpriced at all.

I have allowed my husband for the past few years to deter me from going to iPic because we could go to Studio Movie Grill for one-third the price and still have comfy reserved seats. (He had been here before, but I had not.)  No offense to the SMG, but on a semi-discounted mid-day week day, this was worth the price of admission and then some!  Really, comparing these two are like apples and oranges, or more like Ruth's Chris to In 'n Out Burger.  Both are great at what they offer, but it depends upon what you want out of the experience.  First of all, this felt like a real date with my hubby . . . the all out wine and dine with a movie. We were in the high-end seats which recline, and ones that are just two together, instead of an entire row of seats. I didn't notice anything else going on in the theater. Contrary to some people's opinions, the servers never distracted my view. This has always been a problem for me at SMG as servers are always ducking in front of the screen.  Not so at iPic.  We also ordered off the menu -- we were both delighted with appearance and taste of everything we ordered . . . The Chinois Chicken Salad Rolls were delicious and filling. The Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls were heavenly. You could taste all the flavors of the blue cheese and buffalo sauce with tender chicken. And lastly, we had the Loaded House Baked Potato Chips -- plenty to share . . . for two or maybe even more.  The menu at the adjoining restaurant Tanzy looked tempting, so next time we might have brunch first on the weekend and then do the movie.   Bravo to iPic . . . an Academy Award in my book!

Yume is yummy!   You have got to love a place that before you even order, they bring you free miso soup and salad! The Happy Hour menu is two pages long and priced just right. We ordered all kinds of rolls, squid salad, tempura, Tofu Gooey (golden pan fried tofu with sweet miso sauce), and a couple of very interesting and tasty appetizers that I have never seen before -- Monkey Brains (Deep Fried Mushroom stuffed with Spicy Tuna) and Tuna Ball (Spicy Tuna served with Tortilla Chips). A friend ordered the Chicken Noodle Soup -- I was envious -- a huge bowl of soup laden with oodles of noodles, vegetables and chicken. I should have asked for a taste, knowing that he had ordered it before and loved it. Everything was fresh and flavorful.   Our server was lovely . . . very personable and sweet. She let us order at our own pace, and made sure that everything didn't come out of the kitchen at the same time.   The restaurant is small but welcoming and comfortable. I love the "grease pen" concept. You can use it to mark your choices on the menu . . . and then the menus can be wiped off and reused.   Can't wait to go back and try some of the Korean offerings, like the seafood pancake and bi bim bop.  I'll definitely be a regular here!!!

Still yummy!  First of all, I have to rave once again about the free miso soup and salad that comes before you even begin to order.  I am addicted to the salad dressing.  They should bottle it and sell it!!!  We were craving the Monkey Brains ever since our last meal here (an incredible melding of flavors and textures that melt in your mouth) and wanted to try at least one of the Korean dishes.  We ordered the Summer Crunch Roll (Fried Shrimp, Spicy Crab & Cucumber with Crunch outside), and it was fresh and quite tasty.    The owner came by to see how we were doing (he remembered us from a couple of weeks ago, even remembered that we were with another couple trying oodles of appetizers) . . . That is impressive!  We talked a bit about the Korean options on the menu and he recommended the Beef Bulgogi (Grilled Prime Cut of Beef, marinated House Sweet Soy Sauce).  He promised we wouldn't be disappointed . . . and we weren't.  Out come a long, large rectangular plate with mounds of the most moist, flavorful and tender beef, with a heaping  portion of white rice, and two delicious Mondu (potstickers).  We were in a lovely food coma after having polished off the entire plate!  Next time, Pork Katsu!  Early on a Friday evening, they had a steady stream of customers which is very promising for a restaurant just starting. And it looks like as the warmer weather draws near, they will have some patio seating as well. Yippee!!

I've been here twice in the past two weeks with friends for lunch. For some reason, this restaurant was totally off my radar since it opened, and we've even been to iPic a few times as well, never even giving it a glance. Based on recommendations from a friend, I gave it a chance when my friend came to town from Sydney . . . and neither of us were disappointed.  First of all, the restaurant is visually stunning with a living room like area which is accompanied by a glass fireplace when you walk in. There are tables that line the exterior wall for a view of the happenings below in Scottsdale Quarter, or their are some huge comfy booths with marble table tops that line the inside and middle. Either way, the seating is comfortable.  Both times I dined there the place was virtually empty.  I am not sure if this is because there are less moviegoers during the week at lunch time or something else.  Service was friendly and attentive, although both times I had to ask for sweetener for my iced tea when they didn't bring it with the tea. Minor. Both times the server introduced him/herself, which I like since I hate saying "excuse me" to the air to get someone's attention.    The first meal was brunch that was offered on a Friday. Both of us were delighted as neither of us had breakfast that morning . . . eggs it was!  My Australian friend excitedly ordered the Eggs Sardou (for those who don't know what this is, like me, it's poached eggs, baby artichokes, crispy prosciutto and truffle hollandaise). It came as a brunch special with a side (hers was the brown sugar bacon) and a cocktail (the Boca mimosa). She was on Cloud 9! I ordered the omelet with spinach and gruyere; the eggs were cooked as I ordered - light and fluffy).  But I was really bowled over by the hash brown casserole that I ordered as an upcharge instead of the usual hash browns or breakfast potatoes that accompany the omelet. The cheesy crispy blend of the potatoes and the parmesan, gruyere, gouda and cheddar cheeses, as well as the crispy onion, were to die for.  I could have eaten an entire plate of these alone . . . yum, yum, yum!!!!  My second meal was a true lunch with a different friend. She had been there many times before and said that the salads were the way to go.  I could not make up my mind as all the choices sounded delicious. I was torn between the Pan-Seared Branzino salad and the Spinach and Strawberry salad (to which you can add your protien).  Since my friend ordered the Branzino, I opted for the Spinach and Strawberry with grilled chicken since she agreed to let me taste her Branzino. Both salads were fresh, plentiful and delicious. I have to say that the grilled chicken on my salad was some of the tastiest, moistest, grilled chicken I have had in a long time.  (I suspect it is the same grilled chicken that is used in the Chicken Chinois rolls on the iPic menu about which I have raved in an iPic review). The salad was perfectly and adequately dressed with the most delightful herb balsamic vinegar. Each spinach leaf was perfectly covered -- a rarity in most salads I have ordered, even at some of the finest restaurants.  My friend and I stayed long past our welcome in the restaurant . . . three hours had gone by, and yet our delightful server Jill offered us more tea and more water, or anything else we wanted each time she passed by our table.  Two fantastic experiences surely deserve more visits!!!  We'll try dinner next time!!!

What a stunning space was the first thought in my head as we first entered Parc Central! With it high ceilings, sexy and sleek decor (as if Scottsdale needs more of that, right?), I hoped the food would at least match my first visual impression. It was a Tuesday evening, and early (about 6 pm). There were a few tables already seated and not many people at the front bar. Perfect, I thought, for my old high school friend in from Dallas and I to catch up. The restaurant started to get a little busier around 8 pm, and the noise slightly ratcheted up, but we were still able to have great conversation without speaking louder than our normal voices.   Let's start with the drinks . . . The wine list takes up the entire back page of the menu and we started there, but then were persuaded by our server to try one of their specially mixed cocktails. She raved about the mixologist and how she could blend unusual mixers. I had the Lemon Tree which was so delicious I could have drank it like I was drinking iced tea . . . it was garnished with a very unusual cherry soaked in rum or brandy (what a confection)! My friend had the Park Central Harrington, a citrus-orange based concoction which I tasted and was equally as tasty as the Lemon Tree. Mind you, the cocktail prices are upwards of $11-$13, a little hefty in my opinion, but worth every savored sip! So far, our server has batted 1000.   The appetizer and salad menu had so many interesting choices we had a hard time deciding. One of the most unusual items on the app menu is Welsh Rarebit. The cafeteria at our old school used to serve Welsh Rarebit and we had a good laugh about that being on the menu. I wanted to order it for old times sake, but my friend couldn't remember if she even liked it, so we passed. (Don't worry, I won't pass up the opportunity to go back and try it although I doubt our old cafeteria version had beer in the cheddar sauce.) Again, based on our servers recommendation, we chose the Parc Central Salad and the Crispy Tiger Shrimp Tempura. Both were beautifully presented. The salad was dressed perfectly and a nice size for sharing. The shrimp was out of this world delicious. I saw that one previous Yelper thought the sauce was too sweet. Hoisin sauce is always sweet (ever have Moo-Shu pancakes -- that's hoisin sauce!). We languished over ever morsel. The shrimp were huge - plump and juicy, and the tempura batter was crunchy -- just perfectly coated. Again, our server has batted 1000.   The entrees ran the gamut from smaller hand helds (like mini-burgers) to larger portions of fish, beef, poultry and lasagna. It has something for everyone. My friend had the ahi tuna grinders which she enjoyed -- I didn't even get a taste :( -- which came with either shoestring fries or beet chips. She chose the beet chips, which came as a plentiful helping, more than enough to share. I opted for the Roasted Chicken Lasagna which our server described as more of an alfredo version of lasagna (no red sauce). The fact that it had truffle beurre blanc was the real selling point. What came on the plate was a deconstructed version of a lasagna. It was superb, but I was so full from the prawns and salad, I only had two bites and brought the rest home. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach, so I am always bringing home a doggie bag. However, the true testament to a great dish is being able to bring it home, heat it up in the mic and away from all the ambiance and distractions, and still love it. Sometimes it is even better when the flavors get to meld together a little longer. Another home run this afternoon for lunch!!! And just in case I was a little tipsy from the alcohol at dinner, I had my husband (who wasn't with us) try some for breakfast, and he was equally as pleased!   So with all this batting 1000 and home run references, why didn't I give Parc Central 5 stars? They struck a nerve with my biggest pet peeve -- bringing out the entree when we weren't finished with our appetizers!!! A huge faux-pas in my book.   But don't let that deter you from going to Parc Central . . . it was a great meal in fab surroundings. Also great for people watching -- my friend found it interesting that there were so many tables scattered about with groups of women dressed to the nines. I explained with three words -- "that's so Scottsdale". Now, that might deter you :)

When I review restaurants . . . service, atmosphere and food get weighed almost equally. Maybe it was an off night for CPH, and perhaps based on previous reviews, my expectations were too high. I so wanted to give it five stars. I took a friend from out of town there for the last night of Arizona Restaurant Week.   The Pros  Food - (5*) The menu choices were fantastic -- something for everyone. We both ordered the Original Chopped Salad and the Scallops. Both were delicious. (FYI - I had the Kantak Chopped for three nights in a row now, twice at Amaro in Cave Creek. It is my new favorite!) The flavors and textures in this salad are perfect. The pan seared scallops were tender, juicy and sweet. Desserts for me were overkill, but it came with the meal. The "Pig in the Orchard" Bread Pudding was delicious, but not as delectable as the Irish Coffee Pot de Crème which sent me to Cloud 9.   The Cons:  Atmosphere (3*) Even on a Sunday evening, the dining room is really loud. Even though we were sitting next to each other, we were borderline shouting just to be heard. Nevertheless, the design is cool and inviting.   Service (2*) Our server had zip personality, made no suggestions whatsoever, and didn't bring any bread. She brought our entrees to the table when I was clearly still working on my salad. (One of my biggest pet peeves!)   Will I go back? Absolutely. Based on all the other reviews, this just might have been a peculiar instance so I'm willing to give it another shot.

It was Mother's Day, and It was the perfect afternoon for al fresco dining at La Petite France Bistro.   As usual, I perused the menu on line to help me make a quick decision in advance about what I would order. They had a special three-course menu for Mother's Day, but you could still order off the regular menu. The special menu did not have crepes, and that was why I so wanted to go. I made a reservation and specifically asked for outside dining. I was "un petit peu" flummoxed when we arrived, and they had already seated our friends inside. I asked politely if we could sit outside and reminded the gentleman that when I made the reservation, he asked me if I wanted indoor or outdoor seating. After reminding me that they would have the misters on if it was very hot, I said, outdoor then. After waiting about five minutes for them to set up, we were seated outside on the lovely patio. The tables were set beautifully with white tablecloths, golden yellow colored napkins, and faux rose petals of various shades of pink and red.   It took some time for the waiter to get to our table for ordering drinks, meals, desserts, etc. He was a darling young man originally from Germany (I was surprised he was not French)! He explained that based on reservations, they didn't think they would be so busy so they staffed accordingly. I have to admit that we were all quite pleased that we weren't rushed through our meal and had the chance to linger and enjoy the food and the beautiful atmosphere. I don't know if giving us time would be considered usual practice.   The food . . . the menu had so many delicious sounding items, even more that I remembered from the on line menu . . . From Flammelcueche (a rectangular shaped Neapolitan like pizza dish that comes on a pizza board straight from the oven) to croissants to crepes to salads, as I watched orders come out of the kitchen, I had a difficult time making a decision . . . I think anything would have been a great choice! My husband and our friend had the Hawaiian Crepes which were creamy, lite, but still filling. My crepes Provencal were reminiscent of the crepes I had in Versailles at a famous little creperie with goat cheese, vegetables and eggs. Our other friend had the La Pacific quiche with smoked salmon, cream cheese, dill and capers. It was a gorgeous mini quiche, not a slice from a large pie. We were all very pleased. Each entree came with a side salad with homemade dressings. I had the orange vinaigrette and it was so fresh and flavorful. Hubby had the Honey Raspberry that also was so light and delicious.   The piece de resistance was the dessert crepes. Because we had waited so long for our "Banana Split" crepe, our waiter comped us a Royal Chocolat -- it was heavenly . . . with a crispy hazelnut bottom topped with a chocolate mousse cake. After devouring that, we didn't need the Banana Split crepe, even sharing among the four of us, but ohhh, I wouldn't have missed it for the world! I rarely order desserts out, but this was an absolute must . . . the warmth of the freshly made thin crepe with the coolness of the vanilla ice cream, accompanied with banana, strawberries, caramel, chocolate, butter, coconut and fresh whipped cream, it was completely sinful and worth every calorie!   This particular day, I felt transported back to the little creperie in Versailles. Okay, so we weren't surrounded by centuries old buildings . . . but our stomachs felt like we were! Bon appetit!!!!

"Ab"solutely "Sinthe"ful Fun!  My jaw is still aching from laughing so much! The 90-minute show went by in a blink of an eye and left us wanting more, more, more! Absinthe mashes up bawdy comedy, titillating burlesque, and stunning acrobatics to create one truly memorable show! Sit in the front row and you might become comedic fodder for the rest of the lively audience! That's exactly what happened to me . . . and while I'm a little on the shy side, I took it in stride as I was pegged as the "Republican Lady" brought up on stage to judge a male lap dance competition between Mr. Middle White America and Mr. Cool Hip Black Dude. I won't tell you any more . . . but it was a riot!!!  A definite must-do in Vegas!!!

Butters was a great spot for our Sunday brunch. I was anticipating a very crowded restaurant, with a long wait, much like its sister restaurant Butterfield's on Shea. I was pleasantly surprised that we were seated right away.   Neither hubby or I could decide between the breakfast and lunch menu. Everything we saw that was brought out from the kitchen looked enticing. Hubby opted for the corned beef hash skillet with raisin toast! He proclaimed it as the best corned beef hash he's had here in the valley -- quite the compliment. I, being the pickier eater of the two of us, ordered the grilled cheese sandwich on artisan bread with bacon . . . my preference always is the bacon had to be done very well and the fries, almost burnt. And that is pretty much what I got and loved every bite!   Service was friendly, but not overwhelmingly so. Coffee and iced tea were both refilled without having to ask or wait too long. The restaurant itself is pleasant, clean and well laid out. I hope to be able to sit on their patio soon, if we get a day below 100 degrees. Expect nothing fancy. The bathrooms were immaculate. Prices are very reasonable!   I loved that the employees get to eat in the restaurant on break . . . if they sit next to you, then you'll know what to order next time. The salads looked so delicious!   We'll be back . . .

I'm definitely torn on how to review this "new" restaurant  to the N. Scottsdale/Carefree which was previously located in Phoenix. The location is fantastic, on the second floor of the El Pedrigal Shopping Plaza. The views are beyond stunning. The decor is really cool and the seating is so comfortable. Tables are generously spaced from one another, with various different configurations -- booths, banquettes, tables, bar.  I love the red and white checked tablecloths that screamed Italian to me. They have poker chips and Bicycle decks of cards on the table to pass the time . . . A great idea considering my husband And I played four games of gin rummy before our food arrived, and that was at 1:30 pm on a Friday afternoon with only five seated tables.  They menu is much more extensive than I had anticipated, given that it is a pizza place. I was really pleased to see that they offer a 9" personal size pizza. Great when no one else wants pizza and you do. They have so many gourmet pizzas as well as a "create your own" option. There are several salads and sandwiches. On this occasion hubby ordered the Philly Cheesesteak. It was delivered piping hot, a beautiful specimen, with a cheesy coating melted from the grill.  I had to pick off a piece and try it for myself . . . Ooh, so yummy. The sandwich came with a side of fried zucchini which was lightly dusted with Parmesan. Delish!  So where I am still on the fence is with the pizza. We ordered a medium sized thin crust with mushrooms, ricotta and spinach and half with pepperoni. It's not Neapolitan style to which I have become so accustomed and is currently my favorite style, nor was it wood-fired. The red sauce is really tangy, and overwhelmed the toppings, including the cheese and the pepperoni. It isn't bad, but not at the top of the list.  All things considered, I probably would go somewhere else for my Pizza cravings, but I love everything else about Brugo's so it will likely be a part of our regular rotation for salads and sandwiches. So happy to have a fun, cool restaurant devoid of the cowboy vibe in our way North Scottsdale neighborhood! The sunset views are a definite bonus!!!!

This is a mixed star review. I have averaged it out to a 2-star, but there is definitely a reason for a return visit which will hopefully garner a more positive updated review.   One-Star:   Two of our four entree orders were wrong. My friend ordered a salmon salad and specifically asked the waitress about the dressing. What she received was the salmon entree. I ordered the Pasta Primavera without peppers, substitute eggplant, and add shrimp. My pasta had NO shrimp and NO eggplant. At least they took the peppers out! Our server said she checked the order and that the kitchen made the mistake. Ten minutes later, the owner said the order was put in incorrectly. Go figure . . . he threw the server under the bus. (I hope she wasn't fired because she was otherwise really sweet.)   Also one-star:   Entrees were brought out at different times. Restaurants say they do this so that the patron will receive his or her meal fresh and hot without it withering under the heat lamps. I disagree . . . it is poor kitchen management and/or lack of skill in the kitchen end. Coordination is key. I don't want to be eating while my dining companions are still waiting for their meals . . . so by Emily Post standards, waiting under everyone is served, my food would be cold anyway.   Three-Star:   The food was okay, nothing spectacular. Maybe I too had high expectations based on other Yelpers reviews? Maybe we ordered the wrong items? I should also look more closely at who is reviewing the restaurant because people who tend to have only one review posted are not really reliable Yelpers. I digressed . . . The garlic knots where doughy and flavorless -- if you're going to call them garlic knots, you need to put more garlic in them! The calamari fritti was actually quite tasty. Both appetizers are good for sharing and each came with a salad accompaniment with a very delish dressing. My husband had the Veal Marsala which came with veggies and whipped potatoes. He polished it all off and thought it was a satisfying meal. One friend had the penne a la vodka and he too was satiated, but neither were bowled over. My friend's Salmon Salad (which they brought out long after the others had finished their meals) was good (I did taste it) and the lime dressing was heavenly. My pasta primavera was not only made incorrectly as stated above, but it was blah.   Four-Star:   The wine list has great options and my husband found a great Nebbiolo by the glass. Rarely does he order two glasses with a weekday meal, but this one was worth it. My girlfriend and I each had cantaloupe martinis. They were divine. Mine has a huge piece of cantaloupe which I saved until the very end as my "dessert". On the other hand, the bartender forgot to put a piece of melon in my friend's, so we had to ask for one. (More inconsistency.)   The restaurant itself is aesthetically very nice with dark woods and stone. They have some very cool high top dining tables as a seating option. I can see how they would be really fun for sharing pizzas, bruschettas and having drinks. The restaurant is on the noisy side.   Five-Star:   How they handled our wrong orders and complaints. Let me start by saying we are not mean people and we are pretty easy to service. When the salmon salad came out as the salmon entree, we politely pointed it out to our server and she made good and apologized. Shortly after, when I discovered that my pasta was wrong, I laughed and said, "well you're going to be a little sorrier . . . " She again apologized and offered to have it redone. At that point, the guys had finished their meals and my friend was going to have her salad shortly, so I didn't want to linger and said I didn't really want it now. She took the item off our tab (packed it up to take with me), and also took the salmon salad off the tab as well. She offered to buy us another round of drinks or dessert, which we declined. She asked if we wanted to speak to the owner . . . we told her it wasn't necessary but then we thought better of it and asked to speak with him. I don't think our server was too happy about it . . . we didn't throw her under the bus . . . Joe, the owner, was very apologetic and sincere and asked if were would give Stone and Vine another chance. He asked us to wait one minute and came back with two gift certificates for $20 each. Big kudos to Joe for doing the right thing!

What makes a fabulous all-day breakfast joint even better? When they move to a larger space that's lighter and brighter and even has a small outdoor patio, that's what! You can't miss with anything on the menu at Pamela's. A must is the Lyonnaise potatoes with any meal . . . so scrumptious!   I love the fact that they give you a nice-sized carafe of coffee so you don't have to wait for refills, and it's pretty good coffee to boot!  If I lived in the Burgh, there is no doubt this would be on my regular rotation for weekend breakfast . . . maybe even a couple of days during the week, too!

This was our second time having food at Cibo e Vino, the first was take-out, and this time we actually dined on the patio. Both times we have had very good food, so I am not sure what the deal is with the negative reviews.   When we ordered take-out, my husband had the calamari, which was quite good, and we both had the pizza.  I am in love with Grammy Rose pizza, which is loaded with eggplant, ricotta, tomato, garlic, and basil. The crust is thin, but not too thin where the crust can't hold the toppings. My husband had the vodka penne with chicken. It was delicious!   A couple dining beside us had one entree come out and it was cold. She asked for it to be warmed up. The manager/owner brought it back out afterwards and said he would take it off their bill. That is excellent customer service!  We actually brought our dog with us and they were fine with her on the patio. They even brought a little bowl of water for her.  We are very happy to have this little casual Italian eatery in the far north Scottsdale area.

With all the hype, I was so hesitant to even go within a mile of Dominick's until a girlfriend from the East Coast here on a two-day trip made it there before me! Glad that I had a real foodie give me her honest opinion before I ventured through the door on a Saturday evening. My hopes were high, my expectations realistic.  Random thoughts I jotted down in my notes section of my iPhone . . . the decor is dazzling with its crystal chandeliers which are much less pretentious than I had imagined. They need to fix the chandelier in the dining room adjacent to the bar, separated by the glass panel . . . it's crooked and with my OCD, it drove me crazy. Watch the floor and steps, the hallway leading to the bathroom downstairs slants, the steps leading up to the third floor pool bar and dining are a disaster waiting to happen with patrons going up and down at the same time servers are carrying large trays . . . seriously in need of some dumb waiters. The live music was a great accompaniment for the setting and not intrusive at all. In fact, the female vocalist had a lovely smoky, jazzy voice which was quite enjoyable. Mr. Piano Player . . . Please skip the Neil Diamond ballads. The bar was definitely the scene. I have never seen so many bleached blondes in platform heels all in one place. Gentleman wearing the baseball caps . . . not proper attire, even in the bar!  Getting down to the nitty gritty . . . our server J. Lee was fantastic! I have read some other Yelpers opinions of the service, including that of my foodie friend, and had some concerns, but J. Lee was totally on the ball. I wouldn't hesitate to ask to be seated in her section whenever she is working.  The food . . .   Reminder to self . . . easy on the bread if you want to eat your entree and sides and maybe save room for a bit of dessert. The bread basket offers something for everyone, and then some. The stick-thin breadsticks, the fig bread, the onion focaccia . . . incredibly delicious. We had oysters on the half-shell, six Blue Points that finished beautifully, accompanied by cocktail sauce, a tartar like sauce and "atomic" horseradish. We also split a spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. (I had heard that they don't split salads, but this wasn't the case for us. In fact, they gave us two plates with dressing on the side.) Nice, nothing fancy.  My hubby ordered the chef's cut filet, his daughter the petit filet, and for myself, the Chilean Sea Bass Spiedini syle.  The filets were cooked rare per our request. Totally awesome . . . melted in our mouths. The Chilean Sea Bass was huge . . . it, too, cooked to perfection with a light coating of gently seasoned bread crumbs. All main entrees were seasoned well . . . Everything is a la carte, so we ordered two sides, the Signature Au Gratin potatoes and the Creamed Spinach Spiedini. The portions are colossal! The potatoes were so creamy. The spinach was divine. We ate maybe a third of both, brought the rest home and polished them off this morning for breakfast. They were just as delicious! As it was my husband's daughter's birthday, which we had mentioned when we made our reservation, they offered her a dessert on the house. They brought her the flourless chocolate cake with a candle, Happy Birthday drizzled on the plate. She ate two bites, said she was in chocolate nirvana and had the rest packed up to go. Hubby ordered the Bananas Foster cake . . . OMG! What a sensual experience . . . and way too many calories, but heavenly.    Not big drinkers, we ordered a bottle of Duckhorn Migration Pinot Noir. Reasonably priced I'll admit for a swank restaurant. We also ordered coffee to accompany our dessert. It was the only negative . . . very bitter.  Our experience at Dominick's exceeded my realistic expectations, and then some. The service was attentive and spot on, the food was top-notch, and atmosphere purely Scottsdale. I was reminded of that as we walked across the street to our non-valet parked car . . . a gleaming white Rolls was pretentiously parked right in front . . .

I'm always looking for a great casual bite near Scottsdale Healthcare on Shea. Lo and behold, I found Taste of Greek as I was waiting in the endless drive-thru lane at Starbucks. Greek . . . one of my favorite cuisines . . . could they possibly have Babaganoosh? And if so, will it be any good? Today, on my way back from a doctor's appointment, I stopped in and there was my beloved Baba on the menu.  I ordered some to go. Ahh, it is so delicious . . . very smooth and smoky.  I wonder if they make it themselves? Who cares? It's delicious. Can't wait to try the gyros. Everyone seated had one and they looked very satisfying :)  The counterperson was very sweet and enthusiastic. The gentlemen cooking were very focused on what they were doing. They barely looked up until one of them called my number for pick up. He, too, was very personable and thanked my for my business.  The restaurant itself is small, great for take-out. Drinks are self-serve. Taste of Greek will definitely be part of my regular rotation!

I love this place and can't wait to go back in the beautiful warm weather to sit on their patio and languish over another delicious pizza!  We have tried all the newer pizza places that have sprung up in North Scottsdale, but none have come close to LAMP's fresh ingredients and perfectly done thin crust. I had a hard time making up my mind on which ingredients to add to my pizza. (There is usually something I want on all the different pizzas, and because I'm not a meat person, I make my own combo.)  This night it was onion, mushroom and ricotta. The wood roasted crimini mushrooms were so tasty I could have eaten them all by themselves, and the onion, which was described as a caramelized onion marmalade, was amazing. I think I picked a winner!   My husband had "The Scientist" which was topped with different kinds of salami and green olives. He devoured every bite in record time. Our friend had the Grilled Vegetable version and she, too, ate it all, except a few pieces of crust! We all agreed that we would definitely go back!  At LAMP, they don't over-sauce the red pizzas so you get to taste all the flavors of the toppings. If you make your own, they advise not picking more than four toppings so that the pizza slice will still be manageable to eat . . . .as it should be. (I try to stay away from knife and fork pizzas!)  A friend of mine was there a couple weeks ago and raved about the Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake . . . I begged my husband to order one so I could taste it, but he said we'd save it for another time when he remembers to leave a couple pieces of his pie to take home. He was just too full!  Our server was friendly and attentive, and gave us plenty of time to make up our minds. He was efficient, but not intrusive.  The restaurant itself is pretty funky, but comfortable. The red tile LAMP oven is one of the centerpieces of the room. I loved the mixed up chair designs. The space is comfortable. By 6:30 pm, the place was packed with couples, families and groups of friends. I can see LAMP having great success as it is unpretentious but serves up some great food.    In the immortal words of Arnold . . . "I'll be back . . . "

We're not big beer drinkers so I can't attest to the beer selection. If you are looking for beer reviews . . . this isn't the one for you.  The restaurant came as quite a surprise to me . . . upscale North Scottsdale and the name "Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers" didn't seem to fit the area. Nevertheless, Hubby and I had read about the Make Your Own Mac & Cheese and were instantly intrigued.  I personally have been a fan of all mac & cheese, even the Kraft box cheese, since I was a kid, but now with all the gourmet versions available, I've become quite a mac & cheese snob. CB2's mac & cheese didn't cut it for me or my hubby. It is a nice sized portion to share, even as just a side.  It was creamy, but bland . . . made with what appeared to be wide egg noodles instead of actual pasta noodles. The base cheese is very mild pepperjack and provolone, so we added some swiss and gruyere.  Still not flavorful enough. So we packed it up and brought it home, doctored it up and ate it the next day for lunch.  My husband had the Bacon Blue Burger.  It was good, but he has had much better, even at BluBurger Grill. Because the burger is so tall, they bring it with a steak knife . . . you really do have to cut it to eat it. I had a grilled cheese sandwich . . . it was pretty decent, although if they messed something like this up, they would have received one star.  Both our main courses came with a side . . . we chose the sweet tots. They were good, but not as delicious as the sweet tots from Tryst Cafe. If you love those, these will surely disappoint.   The gentleman who took our order and ran our food was delightful and helpful, as were the other food runners in the restaurant. The restaurant is clean, fast and provides plenty of entertainment with a dozen plasma screens running mostly sports. The clientele ran the gamut, from older couples to families with kids.

This is one of the nicest Walmarts I have shopped.  We went on Black Friday, mid-afternoon and with the exception of the electronics section, the place was pretty empty.  The fresh produce was really fresh, and we were surprised at how many wonderful items they stocked. The cashiers were friendly and the other store personnel quite helpful in guiding us throughout this new location.

Great place to sit on the patio, enjoy weekend brunch, and watch the planes take off and land.   Although the menu is rather small, it provided the basics for brunch. We ordered a potato chip stack and neither my husband nor I had a clue about how huge the portion would be. A table of four could easily share this! Definitely filling and delicious! Both of us had omelets which were very good . . . not the best we've had, but overall quite good.   Service was spot on and friendly.  I wouldn't hesitate coming back and would like to try it out for lunch as the menu looked very enticing.

This was the highlight of our trip. Amidst the clanging machines and the NASCAR fans late night whoop whoops in the casino, the bang-bang of the machine guns was a welcome respite! Seriously, the Mob Museum has so much to offer to the most enamored and infatuated mafia wanna-bes (it's romantic) and to those who have a genuine thirst for knowledge and history.  There are so many different types of media to view, old newspaper clippings, mob memorabilia, FBI files, films on "hits", "Hollywood", old Vegas, senate hearings, and interactive exhibits.   You start on the top floor in a "line up" where the museum page will take a picture of you along side four others. As you wind through the top floor maze, there is so much to read about the history of the mob (throughout the world and Vegas). It gets a little dizzying and the information is overwhelming. I just started scanning everything, then went to picking and choosing the parts that interested me the most. Had I stayed and read each little piece (and I am a fast reader), I doubt we would have left before the building closed for the evening (and we arrived at 10:30 am).    The second floor houses a courtroom that presented Senate hearings. Not only interesting, but it provided the ability to sit a spell after standing throughout most of the top floor. The second floor continues the story of the mob "connections" and the individual infamous mobsters. By the time you get to the first and last floor, you pretty much know what happened to all of them, and the status of the "mob" in today's world.    We took about three hours to see everything, which included watching all the films and listening to most of the information displays, playing with the machine gun, the interactive "shooting the bad guy" exhibit, and a quick tour through the gift shop.  Definitely worth the price of admission and then some!

I love sushi, pure and simple. I did not love this place even though I love the concept. If you are a sushi fanatic and want fresh, melt in your mouth fish, this is not the place for you.   I had three different sushi dishes - tuna, salmon, and whitefish - all the fish was dry and tasted the same. My husband picked up four different rolls - Hawaii, Dragon, Spider and Crunchy Spicy Tuna - with exception of the sauce, they too tasted the same. We thought the seaweed "nori" wrap was very "chewy" and tasted funny. The gyoza and the Inarizushi (stuffed tofu skin) were actually the best things we had.   Service was friendly and efficient. I like how you know the price of the item by the color of the plate it is on.  It is kind of like a reverse cafeteria. Instead of going through the line, the line goes to you!  Among the typical offering like sushi and rolls, they also have desserts (tiramisu, cream puffs, cheesecake), jello and fruit salad.  Think, and then think again, before you trek here. Weigh the choice . . . price vs. quality. The price was right, the quality wasn't.

We drove almost 40 miles (each way) to check out Porkopolis, and it was worth every mile there and back!  Our delightful server Megan suggested we try the Red Neck Tacos to start, claiming that we probably never had anything like them before.  She was absolutely right! The tacos are delicious soft corn pancakes topped with tender pulled pork, jalapeno slaw with sweet and smoky sauce. A fantastic combination, and would have been enough for my dinner alone, maybe with a side, but I had to share with my hubby, who also raved about this unique dish.  For his main course, hubby had the baby back ribs. They were finger-licking good! He claims to be a baby back aficionado, and when he finished his first rib with a Cheshire Cat grin, I knew I had to have a bite even though I have never been a fan of the baby backs myself . . . I am a convert, at least at Porkopolis! I ordered the Barbecue Salmon which came with polenta cakes and fresh veggies. I am always a little hesitant to order salmon out because even when I ask for it to be prepared on the rarer side, it never comes out right. I was even more hesitant here knowing that it had to be cooked and then recooked on the grill. Much to my satisfaction, out came a beautifully done hefty piece of salmon cooked to perfection. I opted to have it prepared with the sweet and smoky sauce instead of the hot and spicy, and it was yummy! The polenta cake had a hint of cheese, and was very creamy in texture, a great match for the salmon! The macaroni and cheese was equally creamy. Loved that it had a "crust" on top.  Both owners, Matt and Brady, came around to greet us and see how we were enjoying the meal. They engaged us in some great banter, commented on my picture-taking . . . "Are you tweeting?" "No, Yelping!" Then I told them they already had two 5-star reviews!  Unlike Brianna, I found the service to be spot on, especially for a restaurant that opened less than two weeks ago. Our server was attentive and on the ball. We never had to ask for a tea refill. We also were thanked by not only our server and the owners, but also by the other servers. Either they heard you Brianna, or you didn't hear them when you left???  By the way, we picked up a bottle of sweet and smoky on our way out. If we can't get to Porkopolis as often as we like, we can bring a little Porkopolis to our home. I can't wait to try it on some chicken, Highly unlikely we could find baby backs even close to the fall of the rib, though.

Let me preface this by saying I am not a big popcorn fan . . . my husband is.  Having about an hour to kill between appointments, I decided to pop into My Popcorn Kitchen to pick up some for him. "Some" is a relative term . . . and as I perused the popcorn variety menu, I was overwhelmed.  Over 60 flavors . . . remember, I am not a popcorn fan, but I wanted to try them all! Not just the individual tastes, but combinations of some of those 60 flavors, too! Without being too piggish, I tried just a few samples: pizza, ranch. loaded baked potato, salted caramel, Scottsdale Blend (white cheddar and caramel mixed), vanilla and cinnamon toast. I ended up buying a small bag of each, two to give to friends, and the rest for my charming husband.  The pizza tastes just like pizza -- a great way to have that scrumptious taste without all the fat and calories! I loved the Loaded Baked Potato more than the real thing! The salted caramel was the kind of savory sweet that I crave every night after dinner. And the vanilla and cinnamon toast were light and not too overly sweet, perfectly addicting.  This particular afternoon, they had bag on display of caramel and green apple. It was so pretty just sitting there, I was almost tempted to buy it without even trying it!  This is a fantastic place to buy gifts for friends or clients. They have all the fixings to make the perfect box, bag or tin. On the other hand, it could be fun to take your kids there, pick up some mini bags of various flavors and colors and string some holiday popcorn for your tree!  The two women who were working the front of the store were so friendly and accommodating! They encouraged tastings and offered up their opinions when asked. I know today was a first of many trips to My Popcorn Kitchen. I might just be a popcorn fan after all!

Isabella's Kitchen gets 5 stars for atmosphere . . . Just love this place based on our first lunch there. The building sits right on the Grayhawk golf course with expansive views of the mountains, and at night, they say you can see the lights of the city. There are plenty of places to hang your hat even if you're not dining at one of the indoor tables -- there are large outdoor couches, rocking chairs, fire pit like seating, outdoor tables, and lights strung from the building. Isabella's is surely going to be a very popular hangout as well as dining spot throughout the year.   Our server Christopher was so attentive . . . and he was very sincere about making sure that everything was to our liking. He was very knowledgeable for the place having just opened only a few days ago, and when he didn't have the answers to questions like "is your patio dog friendly?" he went to ask his manager. By the way, it is unfortunately not dog friendly, but I get it, since it abuts the golf course.   They had many available options on their limited opening menu, more than than some restaurants have on their regular menu . . . but, the regular menu starts tomorrow (October 15th) so no worries. Honestly, having seen the full menu, I probably would have picked the options we had anyway. The mac and cheese is dreamy. The noodles are almost the consistency of gnocchi and very tasty with the accompanying small cubed ham, creamy cheese and crispy bread crumbs. This was one of the best mac and cheese dishes I have had in a long time . . . It was the perfect size to share. If not for the calories, I could have had this as my main course and been full, fat and happy.  Hubby had the meatball sandwich which was a nice size for lunch. I had the eggplant Parmesan sandwich which came on foccacia bread. The layered eggplant was tasty but it could have been a tad bit warmer and had a little more sauce and cheese. Both sandwiches came with a choice of house salad or potatoes, and we both opted for the potatoes. They were just amazingly delicious . . . like a deep fried potato chip . . . very crispy on the outside with the real potato texture inside. Delicious!  We will definitely be back to check out some of the other items that we saw other diners enjoying, like the bruschetta, pizza, and pasta. This is a fun place with a big personality. Mangia! Mangia! Buon Appetito!

I had such high hopes for this new little spot in Cave Creek. It's menu was ambitious with offerings from almost every Asian cuisine, including India.  It was a beautiful evening t dine on the patio, but alas, they had mostly high top tables out there which in my book book does not qualify for a nice, relaxing dining experience. There was one table, and it appeared that the owners or employees were dining or taking a break there. So we sat inside at a four-top tucked in the back of the restaurant.  A server can make all the difference in a restaurant experience. The woman who worked our table had absolutely no personality whatsoever, and she barely spoke English.  At first I was not sure this was the case, and perhaps she was just having a bad night, but when my entree came and it was full of bell peppers (a no-no for me), I am sure she didn't understand what I ordered. My husband asked me, "why did you order something with bell peppers in it and not ask them to omit them?" I thought, "well, it had some veggies in it that were specifically listed, but it did not include the bell peppers in it." I sent it back for them to remake it without the bell peppers. As I was eating it, I thought to myself, this does not taste like what I ordered . . . Having just sent the entree back, I didn't want to put up a fuss . . . I just wanted to leave. My husband was still working on his Indian dish that was at least "3 peppers" hotter than the "one pepper" listed on the menu . . . he, too, wanted to leave.  On the way out I picked up a to-go menu and when I actually looked at it, after we got home, I felt so much better that I wasn't going crazy . . . indeed, what they served me and what I received wasn't even close to anything listed on the menu, and certainly a far cry from what I ordered.  The prices are also way too hefty for what they serve, and even the manager/owner who was lurking around the bar didn't even both to thank us for our patronage on the way out!  There is no way we will go back to Z's . . . a total bust!

So it was a "soft opening" kind of day and we were a little hungry at 2:30 pm, and we've been waiting for this restaurant to open. We don't really have a nearby breakfast/lunch neighborhood place other than The Good Egg (which is old and tired), so we were pretty excited to see what Summit Diner has to offer.  The restaurant is darling, very modern, decorated in greens and blues, with some regular tables, a bar with two plasma TV, and some comfy booths.  They also have some patio seating which will be especially nice in the cooler months ahead. There were a lot of employees abuzz when we arrived. We had a delightful server who wanted to much to please us.  She did!   The food is okay.  I could have given it a 3 star . . . my husband had a turkey Ruben. It could have had a little more turkey, cheese and kraut between the two pieces of thickly sliced bread. I had the chicken, bacon and cheese wrap (on a plain tortilla, though they have tomato basil tortillas as well). My wrap could have had a little more oomph to it as well. I like my wraps nice and full round. This one came out kind of flat. The flavor was not bad, but it just needs something . . . a special sauce to dazzle it up . . . nothing too fancy. Both sandwiches came with a side. We chose the fries, which were actually nicely thin, crispy and hot!  The menu has a bit of everything and they say they will serve breakfast all day . . . a big plus!!!!  So if the food was just okay, then why did I give Summit Diner a four-star review? Well, it is an ambitious undertaking in replacing the old Kashman's that was formerly in that spot, and I think they have the right idea in providing basic "diner" food at very reasonable prices. You can't really tell based on a soft opening what's really in store for this desperately needed type of restaurant in the way North Scottsdale area. I think it is definitely worth giving them a try . . .

I was stoked to try this new authentic Lebanese restaurant in North Scottsdale! I haven't had good, let alone great, Lebanese food in eons since I left Pittsburgh, PA, in 1990! (Okay, just once in all that time, and it was in Montreal (the same folks who catered Celine Dion's wedding)! A little too far to visit on a regular basis.)  Now, I have found my go-to place when I crave all my favorite  Lebanese goodies - like hummus, babaganoush, stuffed grape leaves . . . and the choices go on!  Originally, we were just ordering take-out, but the owners, two of three brothers, were there and offered us some samples of their dishes. I was blown away by the smoky, flavorful babaganoush. It was not pureed to pieces so you could still enjoy the texture of the eggplant as well. My husband wolfed down the roasted red pepper hummus and was smacking his lips the entire time -- best he ever tasted. I am always up for trying something new, and we received a small dish of Majadara which is steamed lentils and cracked wheat mixed with onions, a Lebanese traditional dish that I never tried or even heard of before. Mmmm, it was delicious . . . lovely texture, seasoned just right . . . a perfect combination of protein and carbs . . . great as a meal on its own for lunch!  We chatted for quite a while with owners Tater and Mohammed, asked about how they got into the restaurant business, how they arrived in Scottsdale, and learned more about their chef, who is also a butcher and does his own meat! They were all so friendly and really excited about bringing their family recipes and homemade Lebanese to Scottsdale.   Our take-out was ready! We ordered the original hummus, baba, fried eggplant, grape leaves with meat and rice, and the mixed grill. I was so full from the samplings, I had to wait a couple hours before I could begin to take a bite of the food we brought home! The hummus is creamy and no overwhelmed by the taste of tahini. A little bit of olive oil drizzled in the mix as they advised at the restaurant made it simply divine.  I don't even need the pita . . . I could just eat this by the spoonful, along with the baba as noted above.  The fried eggplant was a surprise. I guess I was expecting something like fried zucchini, with breading, but instead this was more like sauteed with lemon garlic sauce. Yum!   The grape leaves were tightly rolled, like little cigars, and served hot! I haven't had grape leaves with meat in them in a very long time . . . and maybe not ever in Scottsdale. They were the creme de la creme in my experience, just as I remembered those 20 years ago in Pittsburgh.  It was quite funny because my husband only knows grape leaves as "dolmades" which is Greek. When he ordered, the self-proclaimed "white" girl behind the counter taking our order didn't have a clue what it was he was ordering. Anyway, no where on the menu was the word dolmades, only grape leaves . . . guess you had to be there for the looks on both their faces.  The Mixed Grill was a savory, well-seasoned, very tender mix of Kabob, Kafta and Tawook, served with various veggies over rice. It came with a side salad . . . which as of last night, we were both too tired and full to dig into, so maybe later.The Kafta was extraordinary! And I am not a meat eater by any means. My husband dug all the way in and polished off everything, except some of the rice which surely he will gobble up today!  Before we left the restaurant, Temar gave us a couple pieces of baklava to satisfy our sweet teeth! And as we were already out the door, the very friendly chef came running after us to give us a little taste of the kabob meat he just cooked up! Oh we were so happy . . . and in such a food coma!  Tummy full, nap now!  Without a doubt, we will be back to The Mediterranean Grill.  I only wish we lived close enough to take advantage of their 5-mile delivery option. Truly a very pleasant, satisfying foodie experience! Try it, you'll love it!

Voila is the creme de la creme! Located in the space formerly occupied by the Dragonfly Cafe, Voila is a neighborhood gem and bound to become a must-go restaurant once the word spreads. My friend and I arrived at 11 am on a weekday to find the doors locked, but the lovely woman inside explained that the web site was incorrect (they are going to fix it) and that if we didn't mind waiting until 11:30 when the kitchen opened, she would gladly seat us and get us something to drink.  Holey Moley! The coffee was divine! And it was brought with real cream in a creamer! What a treat! We were off to a great start!  The menu was chock full of choices as well as the blackboard that lists specials, soup and mussels. My dining companion and I had a difficult time deciding what to order . . . I could have ordered at least a dozen items.  We agreed to share the eggplant tart as an hors d'oeuvre. The puff pastry was so delicate, abundantly filled with eggplant, spinach and mozzerella and lightly topped with tomato sauce.  Heavenly! It was large enough to have as an entree for one!  Both of us were drawn to the mac and cheese with crawfish and the grilled brie sandwich, but we both opted for the mac (one with crawfish, one without as my dining companion is allergic).  What came to our table was two huge dishes of creamy, lightly browned mac and cheese, enough for at least four people! They do not skimp on anything here! Let me say that other than a mac and cheese that I once had at BItrot d'a Cote in Paris, this was hands down the best I have ever had . . . the perfect amount of cheese to pasta, the ideal amount of chunks of crawfish . . . each forkful so heavenly. But after five sumptuous bites, I had to put my fork down and have it packed to go . . . I shared it with a couple of friends that I visited on my way home and saved just enough to bring home to my hubby, who savored each bite and said we have to go back for dinner . . . ASAP!  While my friend and I lingered over the coffee, we couldn't help but notice that the restaurant was starting to fill up around 12:15 pm. One couple who came in said their favorite table was already occupied . . . by us!!!  We watched as heaping bowls of mussels  were delivered to almost every table around us. I can't wait to try them!  Our server (the woman who graciously opened for us) was attentive and friendly, and the kitchen staged the plating perfectly. And although the small dining room was getting very busy, we were not rushed at all.  What a delightful experience! I can't wait to go back for any meal, although I am very interested in their weekend breakfast (my favorite meal)! Voila . . . aptly named for this restaurant that just appeared by magic!

Do you love fish tacos?  Then this is the place for you! A ray of sunshine has come to the Valley, straight from the shores of Maui!   Although my husband chows down on just about everything, I have to admit, without some prodding from me, he rarely raves about anything, and he had plenty to say about his fish tacos yesterday . . . He knew what he wanted when he walked in the door.  He had no idea he was going to get two plates with one taco each -- one mahi mahi and one ono -- both piled high with juicy fresh fish and 17 secret ingredients most noticeably the mango salsa and coconut slaw which are Hawaiian island sweet and tangy.  Both fishes were equally delicious!  I had the fish and chips, a heaping serving of ono and mahi mahi, lightly fried. It came with a mound of perfectly cooked skinny fries, enough for three people to share! It also came with a small side of slaw. I love this slaw -- sweet from the coconut milk with a hint (and I do mean the smallest amount) of heat from wasabi. Oh so delectable! Heaven!   I have a long list of must-tries including any one of the local fish cooking styles, and the chowder which is New England style with mahi-mahi and ono. Gluten free items are abundant, too.  The restaurant itself is on the small side, and it's order at the counter, get your number, server comes out when it's ready. Benches and tables imitate surfboards. The patio is the place to be if the weather is nice . . . much more quiet. They play island music to add to the ambiance. The owner Kim was on-site and we had a really nice chat with him about his plans for the Valley. We're so glad they picked North Scottsdale for the first location.   Love, love, love Coconut's . . . it's just missing one thing and it would be perfect . . . the beach!

Absolutely outstanding!  We've seen almost every Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas except Zarkana (it's so new) and Criss Angel's Believe (based on poor reviews). Michael Jackson ONE has all the elements wrapped up into one amazing package. With speakers in each seat, the music sounds and feels like you are at an MJ concert (and I've been to a few of those myself). The dancing is spectacular -- with all the signature MJ moves and then some new ones added. The acrobatics are on par with all the other Cirque shows we've seen. I don't want to detail too much and spoil the fun and surprises for other people.  Suffice to say that my first words to my husband after the show were . . . "I'd like to hide in the bathroom until the next show and grab any empty seat to see it again!"  MJ was the consummate performer . . . this tribute and legacy show stays true to MJ and provides the stupendous Cirque experience all wrapped into ONE!

With all the rave reviews and our previous five-star experience at Akira Back's Yellowtail at the Bellagio, we had high hopes for our dinner at Kumi on Saturday night. We had reservations for 8:45 pm after the Michael Jackson One 7 pm show (see separate review), and we arrived promptly at 8:45 pm. We were told by a very sweet hostess that they were running behind and we would be seated within ten minutes.  That should have been a warning for what was to come.   As requested on Open Table, we were seated at a semi-circular booth in the back room (or upstairs as the hostess referred to it). It could be an incredible room except that the lighting is so dim, you can't read the menu. Thank heavens we had read the menu and already knew what we wanted to order. It was quite disconcerting that we were asked by two different waiters what we wanted to order for drinks, and then we were asked again by two waiters what we wanted to order to start. The waiters were initially friendly, but then they seemed to be rushing us . . . and that was strange because the room was not even remotely filled with diners at that point.  Maybe they were playing catch up as the hostess did say they were running behind when we arrived?!  For a new restaurant, they should have spent a little more time explaining the menu, making suggestions, etc.   We ordered in stages so that all the food didn't arrive at once. We started with the Japanese Eggplant . . . one Japanese eggplant cut in half . . . delicious, but not worth the $12 price tag.  We followed that with the Miso Black Cod. Now, this is one of our favorite dishes, and we have had this at some of the best restaurants in Las Vegas, most notably Nobu, and my husband and I both agreed that Nobu has the best around. I'd put Kumi's close to the middle of the pack, not just for its taste, but also its value at $29. Then I thought about the portion and taste of the Chilean Sea Bass I had the previous evening at Mastro's Ocean Club ($45 for a huge piece) with the price we paid  for the Black Cod (similarly priced fishes), and we felt rooked!  We took the advice of previous reviewers and had the Hot Mess roll and the 007 Octopussy. Both were tasty, but we have had much better rolls at Social House. And by the way, good luck seeing what you ordered in the dimly lit room.  I had to take a picture with my iPhone flash on to see how the plate was presented!  The straw that broke the camel's back was that we ultimately waiting over 30 minutes to get our check. We wanted to sign to our room at Bellagio and apparently, according to our waiter, their system was down. He came back to inform us that his manager would be taking care of it shortly. Fifteen minutes later, we received our check, and it was inaccurate, so back it went. Our server, looking ever so stressed out, came over to say they were still experiencing issues and that a manager would again be taking care of things.  Twenty minutes later, the manager came over with our check. He did not apologize for the wait, or that the check was wrong . . . he just walked off.  At that point, my husband gave me the bill and told me that he could not bare to fill it out and said "you do it."  Neither of us were sure if it was the waiter or the manager who was at fault, but I called the manager over again and explained that we were quite shocked that the service was so poor. He said he didn't understand, and as I explained that we waited so long for the check, he said, "I'll have a talk with my server. I wasn't aware of it."  The end.   Needless to say, I have nothing positive to say about our experience at Kumi. I guess if you are stuck at Mandalay Bay and have a hankering for Japanese, then you might choose Kumi, but if you aren't, there are so many better places . . . including Shef Akira Back's other noted restaurant, Yellowtail.

Ventured outside of North Scottsdale and finally made a trip down to Nook for lunch. Hubby and I were big fans on Tagan and Frank's Amaro in Cave Creek, but sadly, things went way downhill when they left :(  We were eager to see what they came up with in their new digs, and we were over the moon!  First of all, just loved the space which is designed with comfort in mind. The spacious semicircle booths which line one side of the room are fabulous. I wish more restaurants understood the concept of the booth! And the bar . . . it has plenty of seating to schmooze up to it, grab a beer, kick back and watch a game with your friends. Nook could be trendy, but it reminds me more of a real neighborhood restaurant and bar, the kind like in my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA.    The menu is eclectic, but favors the Italian cuisine. You can choose decadent, like the Arancini, crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside, with the best tasting fresh house-pulled mozzarella, or choose healthy, like the halibut tacos or albacore salad. For our first time, we chose decadent - the Arancini was delectable, and the langoustines were sweet and tender while the accompanying sauce had just the perfect bite. Hubby had the scrumptious Black Forest Ham sandwich which came with perfect fries. I couldn't resist the Gamberetti e Funghi pizza (shrimp, enoki mushrooms, parmesan and mozzarella).  I issue a challenge to anyone who says that shrimp doesn't belong on pizza!!!  Our informative and friendly waiter Jorge almost issued the same challenge to me . . . by remarking that he had only taken two orders for that pizza before and both were decidedly thrilled with their choice! The thin crust pizza was spot on . . . a melding of flavors and textures that really worked magic in my mouth. As an aside, I initially wanted to order it with gluten free crust, but they were out of it. I am not gluten-free as a medical necessity, but by choice . . . Nice to know they "sometimes" have it. You might want to call ahead to make sure it is available if that's important to you.  We love that the owners greet you at the door, and that they make time to check in with you, see if you like the food, have opinions, etc. They are eager to make Nook a place for you to call home and feel at home. No doubt we'll be back and bring a bunch of our friends with us!

Couldn't resist another meal at Nook . . . especially the Arancini  . . . I'm totally addicted!!  I just have to high five this place another time for its fabulous food and friendly atmosphere. This time, not only were we greeted by Frank, but we were introduced to their adorable and talented Chef Nick who by the way was just featured in the Phoenix New Times.  I love a place where they treat you like family and appreciate your patronage!

Finally made it to Slanted Rice . . . and I was in Seventh Heaven!  What a beautifully designed space . . . and very comfortable!  I love the outside patio decor as well.   They offer a special lunch menu, but you can order off the main menu as well. There are so many choices from appetizers, salads, spring rolls, sandwiches, rice dishes, and dinner entrees. We had a difficult time deciding as we watched orders being delivered to other tables around us. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing and fresh! Hubby and I decided to split two different spring rolls -- the Shrimp and Pork with peanut sauce and the Fried Tofu with peanut sauce. I have to say, they really know how to do peanut sauce!  Hue, one of the owners, also brought out some miso sauce to try as well with the rolls, and that was delicious as well!  Definitely many more rolls in our future.  We split the Crispy Rice in Clay Pot with chicken as our main entree. It was hands down the most tasty rice dish I have ever had. (And I am not a fan of rice to begin with!)  It also comes with a large bowl of soup and a good-sized salad. Definitely enough to share, but next time, I will order one just for myself. I almost inappropriately licked the bowl!!!  The owners Hue and Ty are very gracious and welcoming. I have already decided to have another lunch here later this week, and can't wait to bring in another group of friends for dinner so that we can experience more of everything!!!

I needed a bulb replacement on my Z4.  I waited about two months before doing anything about it since I didn't want to spend more than a car payment alone on a simple bulb replacement at the BMW dealer . . . then I remembered the sign I passed almost everyday for German Motor Works right on Scottsdale Road.  Where did that sign go? Then I thought, wasn't the place just behind the Chevron Car Wash?    A quick call confirmed it was still there.  Andrew was so nice and made me feel like my little bulb replacement was as important as an engine overhaul! "Just give me a call before you come over and I'll take care of it," was all he said, and I knew that my little Z4 was going to be in good hands!  He's a really laid back guy who wants to make your BMW repair as easy and financially painless as possible.  While I was there, I asked his pricing on the Inspection 2 that I would need soon, and it was so reasonable, I decided to get it done at the same time!    I wouldn't hesitate to refer any BMW owner to Andrew and his German Motor Works. My little Z4 is my baby and he handled her with kid gloves!
