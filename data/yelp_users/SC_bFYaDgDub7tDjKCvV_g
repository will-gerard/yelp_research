I used to live right around the corner from this little treat, luckily it is close to work so we can still conveniently enjoy it!   The ironic part of Moto for me, I absolutely LOVE sushi but I order other items on the menu here because they are so freakin' tasty. Two of my favorites include the Moto Chicken Salad (cabbage, chicken, peanuts, celery, green onion tossed in a light sesame vinagrette) and comes in 2 sizes - regular and large. The large is huge - fyi!  The chicken teriyaki bowl is so "clean" - excellent pieces of all-white meat, no chewy surprises... with your choice of white or brown rice. I like the brown rice. The sauce is a sweeter version of teriyaki, but great consistency. Avoid the miso soup - just one salty mess.   Randomly tried their dessert, called "Mojos" - and they really brought out the "fat kid" in me!!! These rolls consist of Nutella, brownie and ice-cream rolled out with a layer of rice krispie treat and then sliced. Gotta atleast try them once!   Great little neighborhood joint. Spent many a night drinking wine on the adorable little patio area.

I have been to the Rokerij on several occasions. We had a marketing retreat there a few years back and booked the private room (which is a great size - seats 12-15 people comfortably) and is fully equipped with a flat screen and computer for presentations and what-not. I had a friend book the room for a bachelorette party (I wouldn't necessarily have a "party" here... but it's certainly a great private space for small groups).  The second time I went, I sat in the main dining space, it was so-so. A little dark for my mood (it was the middle of the afternoon - I just came for lunch) and wasn't feeling the darkness dungeony vibe.  The third time I went, I found that little spot in my heart that was longing for a happy hour space such as this. The downstairs bar is by far one of my most favorite spaces. Thebar stools - large and squishy - perfect for your bum. The fireplace - awesomely lit - and oddly no warmth comes from it? There must be some crazy ventilation - I don't care how but I love it. There are a couple of large circular booths - very private - in the downstairs bar area as well - perfect size for about 4-5 adults.   They have a superb selection of seafood - and everyone around me ordered it. From Sunday to Tues. I believe they have 1/2 priced bottles of wine, we asked the bartender for some reccomendations and he gave us a couple of samples. We ordered a very nice red from Carmel Valley - it was amazing. Coupled with the chicken tacos (quite a kick to them - disctinct horse radish nose tingle...but great spice) and onion rings (more of the gourmet variety - not too greasy at all with very unique sauces) and we had ourselves quite the happy hour.... err actually happy 4 hours...   That's what happens when you go into a bar with no windows!!! You lose track of time...inhibitions out the window... it becomes a black hole with food and wine and friends... it just sucks you in to this vortex of happiness. Rokerij you are my new drug!

Rokerij, I still think you are the ish but I have to tell you, since you began serving Richardson's menu on top of yours I don't think you can handle all of this attention. We booked a reservation of 10 people and you SPLIT us up into two cubbies. Not only did you NOT warn us you were doing this but you reiterated that we were told when we made the reservation that our party was split. We weren't told in advance and that bums me out!   After waiting 30 minutes for our split table, the service was wonderful, the food was divine, but some of the girls were in cranky moods. I jsut suggest when you have a larger party - I wouldn't leave them waiting - i know you are a super succesful and busy restaurant - but we all mattter!

I decided to write this really quickly while I was still full from the deliciousness that is the Tasty Turkey.   My sis used to work for Bruegger's Bagels back in the day and brought me home millions of bagels... this is how my obsession began (thanks for that Christine - probably has lead to my wheat allergy...)   Anyway, the sandwich is served on an Asiago cheese bagel, I prefer the garlic one... tastes better with the chive cream cheese. Add cucumber, tomato, sprouts and of course turkey and you have yourself one tasty sammie.   I only give 4 stars, 5 if my pickle wasn't always so shriveled. Also, 5 if you weren't so darn expensive. And, 5 if you were open past 4pm, some of us want to eat you for dinner!

Oh how I miss browsing the racks at Here on the Corner before my evening classes at ASU. Really great selection of jewelery and funky sunglasses. Bags and purses - awesome - and really good gift items.   Clothing is a bit pricier and tinier than thou - but what a great idea to open a store in the basement of the MU as well! Your "Here" sweats were a hit as well - great way to give us students a little local flair!

I stumbled upon Grooming Humans while still attending ASU. I was living 2 blocks away, and had a serious emergency. I decided to go to Sally's Beauty Supply and purchase "EXXXXTREME hair bleach" - (I swear it had that many x's) and bleach my hair.   Long story short, I goofed up and dropped a dallup of bleach RIGHT on the front/top of my head... the worst place! It bleached my hair a really nice eggshell tone, and I cried my way all the way to Grooming Humans. $200+ later my hair was fixed....I was broke. But damn, I sure looked good! I have been going to Erika ever since. She is a witty, hilarious girl, shoot I would go there just to hang and not get my hair cut! At $50 a haircut I don't get to see her as much as I would like, but I really enjoy the experience + the result. A PLUS!  p.s. being in Tempe, the parking can be a bit tight - bring quarters if you need to park in the street. Don't worry - Erika will run and refill your meter for ya!

"There are good ships, and there are wood ships - the ships that sail the sea. But the best ships - are friendships - and may they always be."  How can you begin a review of an Irish pub without an old Irish blessing? Let me start by saying, Rula Bula is the most understated bar on Mill Ave. Amongst the cherry pits, taverns and middle-aged somethings lurking at The Library Bar (why is that, anyway?) Rula Bula is like a big warm bear hug. The usually have a pretty steady lunch and dinner crowd - it could stand as a restaurant in its's own rite - fish and chips are not as greasy as some, and the potato "rounds" are perfect. My favorite is the Vegetarian Shepards Pie, but @ $10-$15 per meal we don't eat here frequently. BUT we do drink here frequently!    Around 9 or 10pm they have live live music every weekend. This is THE ONLY spot on Mill that you can find live, good local music. The bands change every night - but my local favorites are Shawn Johnson and the Foundation (a perfect blend of Hootie meets Sublime meets your favorite cover songs) and the Irish band that always plays there (I have no idea their name!) but they really bring down the house. Between 11 PM - 2 AM the band really creates a sort of "collective" atmosphere - everyone that is inside dancing (or jigging) to the music.   The crowd is the perfect blend of young college kids, late twenty-somethings and an older crowd. It has a great neighborhood, eclectic feel.   The drinks are average price - roughly $5 bucks for a mixed drink and $3 for a beer. My favorite is a Snakebite (which is 1/2 cider - which they have on tap- with 1/2 Guiness). If you like a lighter beer, try the Snakebite w/ Harp instead.   Like many of the other reviews have stated, they have a huge outdoor patio area (great if you aren't into the music and want something a bit more low-key).  Living in Phoenix 8 years, I have never been to a bar that makes me feel this good.

As you head south on 16th street toward Thomas Rd. it's easy to lose the Barrio Cafe amongst the nail salons, hair salons, and bail bonds (hey, it's a package deal folks!)   Smallish restaurant with tight seating. I can see why people have complained it gets loud. Luckily my co-workers and I were just about the loudest ones there...so my apologies if you were at Barrio today!   I ordered shrimp tacos. I order shrimp tacos everywhere now. I don't know what is going on. Is this a pregnancy craving? I could hop right across the street where they offer free pregnancy tests... just in case.   Anyhoo, the shrimp tacos were the bomb.com. I think the gallo blanco shrimp tacos and these could probably have a Lucha libre-style fight and it would truly be neck-and-neck.   They make their house margy with agave nectar (keepin' it the same plant family) which is a tasty twist. I like agave nectar in my coffee instead of honey...which I used to use instead of sugar. It's the neo-hippie coming out of me.   Overall, decent food, a little pricey ($15 for 4 shrimp tacos) - good serving but at $3 a pop Gallo Blanco might still be the winner. I'd like to come back for brunch - mimosas and chile relleno sounds like a perf Sunday activity. I'd most definitely be back.

I can easily add myself to the club of Last Chance addicts. I have had the beauty of working 2 miles away from this Holy Bargain Mecca for years now, and it has only fueled my Last Chance urges at lunchtime!   Last Chance is definitely not a secret here in the Valley, but I'm not sure if many of you know exactly what the business model of Last Chance is... how they get their merchandise (is this worn? is this Nordstrom's?) so I did a bit of digging, and here's your little Wednesday afternoon history lesson!  Last Chance store first opened at west Phoenix's Maryvale Mall in 1993, then it relocated to Camelback Colonnade in 1995, where it sits today (at the 51 and Camelback Rd.) This is THE ONLY store in the country of its kind - owned and operated by Nordstrom's LTD.   Based on the liberal return policies from Nordstrom's (they literally accept ALL returns, despite wear/tear and use) the company decided to create a bargain store for ALL RETURNS to be shipped to - because Nordstrom's prides themselves on refusing to re-sell any return from a customer. Therefore, the customer knows they are purchasing a truly "new" item. All returns, whether new with tags, returned after minimal use, or worn as their favorite loafers for 3 years are returned... and sent to Last Chance.   Nordstrom operates 112 full-line department stores, 68 Nordstrom Rack clearance stores, two Jeffrey Boutiques, and one final clearance store (Last Chance) all located in 28 different states.   I personally feel very fortunate to have this store close to mi casa. The secret is definitely out about this store - about 5 to 10 years ago this place was busy, but tolerable. In the last few years, there are times that I went and just decide to come back another time because it is just too busy. Lately, and I feel hugely impacted by the economic stresses we are facing - this place has been busting at the seams with excellent finds. Coach purses used to be sparse, now there are tons... want a North Face fleece? How about 2! (I just recently bought one white, one black for $30 each) Manolo Blahnicks for $89? Yes please! L.A.M.B. wallet for $40... it seems life is being breathed back into the place.   I agree with all of the other posts - some of the peeps are nutso mcbutso that shop here - not shopaholics or fanatics - bonafide LUNATICS. It adds to the excitement of it all, but don't get into any altercations with these people. No one needs to get knifed over a pair of Jessica Simpson flats!   I've had friends come in tag-teaming with walkie -talkies in hand. That's a little far for me. I like to come alone, stealthily - independently, so I can sneak in and out and enjoy my own personal bargain-hunting high!

Although this joint is by far one of the best restaurants NOT kept secret - I wanted to share my delicious experience with their temporary summer menu, inserted in their regular menu.  We ordered the "fried cauliflower" - it has now become a  pregger-status craving (anyone can have these cravings - sans baby!!) they are cooked, creamed with a yogurty sauce and mixed with fried sweet onions and dusted with curry powder, and at $3.99 you have no commitment. Just try it!  We also ordered a chopped chicken salad - I have no idea what the name was but it had a great flavor - and the addition of grapes and celery just made you want to take your clothes off and run through the sprinklers. THAT good.   Also, I wasn't aware that P. Jungle had a Happy Hour - let alone a REVERSE Happy Hour - which I would probably be more inclined to go to. I think they have $2 beer and $3 house wines - but the HH ends at 530 - a little early. Reverse HH starts at 9pm and offers a ridiculous array of cheap apps - $1 hummus, etc.   I O.D.'d on pita jungle awhile back - but I'm back baby!!!!

Dear Pugzie's,   I am going to have to change your name to "Granny's" because your warm bread, soft cookies and delicious homemade soups remind me of a little hug from my miniature pill-poppin' granny. When I'm feeling like I should have packed my own lunch, I'll come see you. The only thing missing is a sweet note written on my lunch napkin.    Today you made me some brocolli cheese soup, and I snagged a magazine from the community kiosk (US Weekly - summer bathing suits hot-or-not issue) and had myself quite the nice little lunch.    Thanks for keepin' it real grandma, I'll be back next week for another visit!   Love, MIchelle

This places is miles above the Filiberto's, Ariberto's, or any other widget-bertos that you come across in the great state of AZ. Like many of the reviews have said, the tortillas are soft and chewy and thoroughly delicious. I work right around the corner from this place, and it is incredibly crowded at lunchtime. May fav is the bean and potato burrito - just the tastiest thing. I know you are thinking - potato? In a burrito... but it's good I promise!  I have a very sensitive stomach.. this might be TMI but my friends always make fun of "Grandma" that can't eat at crappy food establishments.. i.e. Jack 'n the Box because "remember that one time we went there and then went straight to Disneyland? Michelle almost lost it on Space Mountain!"  I can't eat at a lot of mexican joints that will "tear you up" as my guy friends say... and this place doesn't do that! So, for that, you get 5 stars Carolinas!

I don't know why Sunset Clothing Exchange moved from it's way bigger digs at Southern & McClintock.. but I guess they wanted to be right next door to Buffalo Exchange...  Anyway, this store is very take-or-leave it. If you are going to BE, stop by there, but I wouldn't go out of your way. I did buy 3 kick ass vintage dresses on a fluke once... and they have really cool art on the walls from local artists, including art by my bud Wiley. I think this place has good, if not great intentions - but just doesn't have the purchasing power to keep the store fully stocked/ or interesting.

For $5.99 for daily lunch specials, Sylvia you are the bomb. Kudos for the shredded beef and non-greasy taco. I split your meal into lunch and dinner - and I'm still full!  You are minus a star because you gave me heartburn - your salsa and flour chips are TOO freakin' DELISH for your own good.

I had to laugh at everyone's review of the 'tude seeping from the little emo hipster nimrods that work here. My friends and I contemplate whether we "feel like dealing with that place" simply because of the little jerks that work there! I would never consider selling anything here, the prices are way too low for what you would get in return. But as a shopper - there are a few freakin' awesome finds that you can get at Name Brand Exchange:  - $4 army/surplus style caps (in khaki/green/black) that have a velcro back... so cheap and awesome  - belly button rings, you have to look beyond the blinged out handcuffs and cherries...but there are some good ones  - cheap shoes - most shoes are around/under $10. Most of my favorite flats come from this joint.   - rubber plugs for yo hipster gaged ears, they have quite the selection  - $3 rack outside, sometimes ridiculously good, sometimes ridiculously bad!   Just go into this place knowing that you may not get attentive customer service, but you could get a killer of a deal!!!

This just in: You know the feather craze going on in the world right now? Well, Name Brand has this awesome selection of feather earrings (and a bunch of other styles) for a buck, so when you cry about losing one by do-si-doing a little too hard at Toby Keith's you can get over it (basically the OPPOSITE of Kim Kardashian losing a $75,000 diamond stud in Bora Bora... don't be THAT girl).   Anyway. 99 cent earrings and a b*tch ain't one!   Do it. The selection is incredible.

The granny girl country skillet is what weekend breakfast dreams are made of. You know when you start to stir around 10:30 am and realize that you are... absolutely ... starving? Chompie's is that perfect 11 am brunch place.   The have a ridiculously thick menu - but I always order the granny skillet. I  have been going to this place since the day I moved to Phoenix (my stepdad took me there first day move into the dorms..aw) and now I feel I have graduated to the "adult" location at Shea Blvd. and 92nd Street. I don't know if I am shrinking, but the portion sizes at this restaurant are becoming astronimical! Everytime I have friends in town we hit up this place - and it seems to leave everyone satisfied, despite their craving. See example:  I wanted breakfast - so I got the skillet (egg beaters scrambled, with country potatoes, turkey bacon, onion, etc. covered in gravy...mmm)  My cousin wanted hot wings - which were actually delicious  My bud Gilbert got a tasty double bacon cheee  Ashley got a breakfast burro...  As you can see, wide array of selections on the menu. If you are so hungover that you can't take off your sunglasses or even begin to try to put a comb through your hair, then the Tempe location is for you. I have found that the Scottsdale location has an average age of about 45, and it looks like they have all gone on a really nice morning bike ride or hike on Camelback and stopped by Chompies on the way to their afternoon pilates.

Grabbed a quick bite here with my girl Amanda before hitting up a concert downtown, and the food was so tasty we should have just skipped the concert and stayed at the restaurant!   I got the drunken noodle - ordered it mild (I believe you can order mild, medium or hot) and it still had the perfect amount of spice. Amanda got hers with grilled tofu - it was incredibly good! Top that dinner off with a Thai tea and you have yourself a nice little meal!

I had the opportunity this last November 2009 to cheer on my beautiful and fearless friend Jordan on her first Ironman endeavor.   I arrived around 6 AM and stayed through her 10 PM completion. The event was very organized, excellent parking, signage, traffic control in general. Certain areas (especially in the morning from the swim to bike transition areas) it was close to impossible to see the competitors.   Throughout the day I truly enjoyed hanging out with my friends (we had an RV parked off of Rio Salado Pkwy) while cheering Jordan on. I did feel slightly guilty as she burned over 6,000 calories exercising I was in the sun, enjoying a little In-n-Out burger.   Consulting with Jordan after, she agreed that the transition areas were extremely organized, her packet and all corresponding material was simply top-notch and would do the event again in a heartbeat!

As we painfully window-shopped our way down 1st Ave. to Pattie's I couln't help but wonder how this rumored "cool" dive bar could be hidden amongst kachina dolls and leather-engraved belt shops...  A little smokey, gritty, hidden diamond in the rough that is Pattie's sticks out of Old Town Scottsdale like an '89 Honda Accord valet parked at Suede Lounge.  The bar is tucked away amongst Scottsdale's awful "3 C's"... cougars, country western attire and bad cowboy art. Upon walking into the bar, I was really surprised -- the crowd of people was plucked from every category - grunge kids, frat idiots, musician wannabe's, tommy bahama shirts, and the occasional Scottsdale douche. We ended up staying there all night, and I danced with a nice, (but hilariously nasty) retired couple with palm trees on their shirts!! This place is literaly a melting pot of drunk peeps.   They are a little slow on service, but I don't blame them on St. Paddy's it was packed! They serve their drinks pretty stiff (thats what she said) and I think I would definitely hit up this spot again!

If you ever find yourself at the corner of Shea & 32nd Street you really need to stop by this little hole-in-the-wall joint! The owner is the nicest guy, and I feel bad for him simply because these are the types of shops hit hardest during crappy financial times like these. He has let most of his employees go and cut back on his hours - BUT there are a few things here that are truly AMAZING!!!!  1. Iced green tea - it is so delicious I crave it. It's about $2 for a HUGE one... (thats what she said)  2. breakfast sandwiches - they taste just like your mom's. Seriously. Bagel or english muffin, real cheese, real egg, the ham is my fav.   3. Tuna sandwich - they put water chestnuts in the mix - it gives the sandwich this crunchy goodness - I swear!   They have a very tiny inside area with a few tables, but a nice little outdoor patio area. I heart this freakin' place, and you will too!

This restaurant's  little subtle southwest nuances make me love love living in the desert. I ordered a few tacos, a carne asada with just the right amout of kick, and the shrimp - which just might be one of the best little shrimp tacos I have ever had.  My friend Amanda suggested the side of local veggies - and they were simply delicious.   The mixture of people dining here was very interesting - a nice mix of professionals, hipsters who like to wear their over-sized sunglasses at all times, and families.   I noticed a bit of brown duct tape was used on the ceiling to blend a pipe end to the burnt sienna surroundings. I loved that. This place is real, they serve delicious food with a simplistic style that will make this one of my favorites from now on.

Came here yet again for happy hour and to check out some flamenco dancing (they offer it every Wednesday evening) and it was beyond amazing. The sangria was so-so ... a little too sweet for my taste.   I stuck to my jack and cokes... and was truly moved by the flamenco performances. The place was packed - so if you want to check out the dancing come around 630 or so. Made me proud to live in the southwest. Ole!!!!

Booking a presentation during the week of the Open and one of the busiest months during tourist season, we were lucky to catch six rooms at this hotel... at $134 (which includes our corporate discount) it wasnt cheap, but certainly one of the least expensive we found in the valley.   The basics:  Excellent beds... Soft sheets, modern all white linens  Tv was ok, nothing high quality there  No desk... Which was kind of a bummer  Amazing shower pressure, super hot water   My room was quiet... 4th floor facing east, minimal noise issues... Ah hem, as in ... A late night brown chicken brown cow situation, let's just say someone should have bought me dinner before having to listen to something that intimate. Over the 4 days it was quiet though. One guy complained of hearing street noise all night at the first floor facing highland.   Quite the tasty breakfast for being free, perfect spot if you are doing business in the biltmore business corridor. I will definitely be back!

Although I give the group of friends I was with Saturday night 5 enthusiastic stars, I have to say this was a very disappointing bar experience. Upon walking in, I immediately felt like the space looked exactly like every other brand new Irish pub - you know the ones pretending to look weathered and old ... and they all end up freakishly looking the same? This place is an exact replica of D'Arcy McGee's at Tempe Marketplace. Which isn't too bad, if you like the pre-packaged, generic Irish pub feel.   I ordered my usual favorite bevvy that I order at every fine Irish establishment - a Snakebite (basic term for a mixture of beer and hard cider) and I said "with Guinness." The bartender looks at me and snaps "that's called a black velvet - NOT a Snakebite" ...  which, I did look up later, and in fact a black velvet was created in London, England, and a traditional Irish Snakebite is made with Guinness - I know this argument is neither here nor there but he was really quite rude about it!  Anyway, the band that was playing reminded me of a cross between Irish music and Kenny Loggins... so we decided to go to our first love.. Rula Bula. I did confess to the bartender at Rula Bula that I did in fact cheat on them "a little bit" ... but they said that after a little bit of counseling our relationship should be back to normal in no time. It was like  I played "just the tip" (look up Old School if you don't know what I am talking about) and I definitely did not like how it feels.

Lately, I've become a huge fan of eating at the bar area of a restaurant. This may be because I've become as inpatient as an 85 year old granny, but I'm digging it nonetheless. Say at the bar with one of my coworkers on our last trip, and it was perry delightful. Efficient service, four peaks on draft, sweet potatoe fries, and a good quality burger. Nice crowd,  and good noise level for such an intimate little restaurant... Overall, solid!

There's no other way to say it:   I fucking love this place!  Mimosa's a plenty, dog-friendly, patio-lovin', brunch menu to die for...  Came here for the "Beer Brunch" ... (two of my favorite things) which is 10 items for $10 with a 10oz beer or Monster Mimosa! Brunch is served from 9a - 2p on Sat + Sun.  I typically can't get away from the green chili pork carnitas (which definitely has SPICE) ...  pork carnitas, scrambled egg, potatoes, beans, cotija cheese and whole wheat tortillas served with a side of fruit.   Happy to see a non-douchy spot pop up in this area - gives me hope that Phx can be cool after all!
