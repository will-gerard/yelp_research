If you're coming here expecting it to be like it used to you'll be slightly disappointed.  No more spicy or regular peanuts, no more real bacon bits,  no more spring mix,  watered down taco meat (too greasy),  watered down chili, no more Warm bread (just sitting out exposed to whatever little kids and other people might expose it to),  no more real butter on 'potato bar',  watered down cheese sauce (gross now!), soups aren't good any more and don't taste homemade like they used to... Seriously obvious they're cutting corners now.   Sweet Tomatoes or Sizzler for me from now on instead of here.  Just found out why... It has a new franchise owner.

I love this place!  My family doctor sends me here whenever I can't get an appointment with them, but now i started to just come here instead because I get in and out quickly, and the staff is always so friendly and professional.  I love that I can check in from home on my laptop, and then they text me when it's time to come in.  Why would anyone want to sit in a waiting room with a bunch of coughing and sneezing people, when I can be laying on my couch watching TV?  I also love that they care enough to call and check on me a couple days later.  Most places nowadays don't care about people like that.  They are treated as customers and not patients.  I was seeing my family doctor for a while about my painful and pitted tongue.  He couldn't figure out what was wrong, but I came here last week, and saw the doctor, and she diagnosed me instantly, sent in a prescription for me, and I am already healed.  Thank you Nextcare!!!

We were on our way to Cave Creek and decided to try somewhere different so we consulted Yelp to see where had good reviews.  It was Sunday during lunch and place was dead... so there was really no reason my burger should look and taste like charcoal.  I had the Hawaiian burger and wife had Greek Burger; neither were good but LOOKED good.  My Hawaiian burger was black on both sides like it had been on fire for awhile and my wife's was burned on one side.  My wife's Greek burger was bland.  She said it tasted like they use bottle dressing instead of making the sauce from scratch.    We had a side salad with our burgers and they had a good assortment of lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a few other things but the dressing wasn't very good (obviously bottled ranch, vinaigrette, and blue cheese).  I showed the waitress my burned burger but decided not to send it back since I never send food back.  I was surprised she didn't take action anyway (I would).  If they were in my neighborhood I MIGHT give them a second chance given the other reviews but I'll never go back.

If you're tired of the Bud/Miller/Coors/Amber Bock choices around here then you have a GREAT alternative!  They'll have food soon and it'll be even better!!   This place used to be Desert Liquors here in AJ and they took over and renovated what I've alwayes called the 'please burn it down' Cactus Club.  Now it is a terrific place to hang out and has a superlative selection of beers and can take home whatever you like too.  Everything they have on tap is top knotch!   I used to have to drive to Mesa to find this selection and could rarely find it on tap.   I highly recommended it! They have regular beer tasting and other events that they publish on their facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Handlebar-Pub-and-Grill/413937897673
