Thank you fellow Yelpers. You did not steer me wrong here. Food was good and price, well that was amazing considering how yummy it was! The atmosphere is fun too. I liked the little Italian grocery store. Wish I had taken more time to browse it, maybe could have taken some of the nom nom goodness home with me. Better yet, could have impressed the wife!.. Who doesn't know I ate here since it was a fun casual business lunch. ...Did I already tell you it didn't break the bank? I mean if you are going to pay for lunch, which I did, then pick this place! ..Hope Mat and Arnie don't read that.   Check it out already!   Did you really just read that entire review? Well if you did read this and you did enjoy the awesomeness of Defalco's then I would appreciate one of those nifty little icons below. Clicked -click.

Horrible experience with this store.   My iPhone was not giving me any sound. Apparently it was stuck in headphone mode. Went in to the Apple store on the North side of town. They did a quick clean out of the headphone port, and when that didn't work they told me I'd need a new phone and they'd have to schedule an appointment to do that. This store was booked up most of the day, and could get me in before my flight out. But their other store was closer to the airport and had plenty of openings. And since I already had it cleaned, I was told they should let me right in and take care of the problem.   So as with all Apple stores, you must set an appointment to get you phone or computer really worked on or replaced. Typically this means they will get you in and out in a timely manner because they are managing the work flow. Well in my case I got there 5 minutes early, was checked in, and then sat down to wait. And wait I did. 30 minutes past my appointment time. Stood up to see if I could get anyone's attention. Couldn't get any employee to acknowledge me. The tech across the table was telling another customer that the WIFI had just gone down, which meant no back up and no phone restoration. Since I overheard this and had to leave soon as to not miss my flight home, I simply walked out.    And I failed to mention earlier that when I arrived I tried to explain that a partial diagnosis from their other branch had already been done. The response was a gruff "that doesn't matter, we still have to do one here."   Overall, very unimpressed with this store. I understand that with the WIFI down, the situation was difficult for them, but the fact that no one even approached me to explain this is frustrating. And to have an appointment to be stuck waiting for 30 minutes is a failure.

These guys have been fantastic. They've got great equipment. They provide fast service. Their prices are the best. And they have funny t-shirts that say, "Get a Spine"  Con: Their signage out front is a little dated with the back bone base.  BTW, they have great prices on massages as well. It's a complete wellness center.

Awesome lunch for under $6. I have never been disappointed with their dishes. My favorite is the Chicken with Vegetables, add a little bit of spice. 2nd on my list would be the Mongolian Beef... You must like onions to appreciate that platter. But again, I have not been disappointed with any of their dishes.

Okay, perhaps my 5 stars is based on the screaming deal I got, but WOW WHAT A DEAL!!   My wife and I were looking at some laminate and vinyl flooring options. Fixing up a temporary double wide, so we were looking for cheaper options. Well a very helpful floor guy walked by and asked what we were looking for. We told him "Cheap". He said, "Let me show you some stuff I am trying to get rid of for dirt cheap."... A few minutes later we cleared out the whole lot of it for half it's price. So yes, the deal was amazing, and the help was super helpful. And now I tell all of my friends offline about this place, so why not tell all my friends online and whomever else about this place?!   Highly Recommended.

First off... very creative use of recycled ReBAR. Awesome to see businesses revamping downtown. Phoenix really needs some night life.  But the real reason for me being a fan... MACARONI & CHEESE. I know, I know, but really, it was that freaking amazing. I had the Naked Mac and Cheese. Naked because it didn't have the bacon and chicken in it. Honestly I don't know if I even want to try the bacon and chicken because the Naked was so divine. I'm not kidding. If you ever make it down to Phoenix and need a cool hang out and late night munchies, hit this joint and order the Mac & Cheese. You'll thank me. If you don't like it then your next lunch is on me.  I also got a little run down from the owner, nice guy, about the foods all being hand made and healthier ingredients. It's always a plus to have good people and a happy owner to greet you.  The only negative, just because I was shocked when I experienced it, was the bathroom. It's got a combined male/female sink area when you first walk in. And I thought I was walking into the ladies room when I opened the door to see a woman washing her hands. ...uhhh... did I just... uhhh... Funny now, but scary when it happened.

Had a very nice evening with my son for his big 12. We took our time eating and talking. The waiter was fantastic, very friendly and very understanding of the big important day. All in all, I'm  happy to have chosen Olive Garden for our dinner out. We will most likely return here for future special occasions.

Smokehouse BBQ cheddar sandwich is glorious! And love the Bee's honey mustard spicy sauce. Actually love the huge array of hot sauces they carry. Although they have not replaced the raspberry hot sauce. I was probably the only one that liked it. Back on track...  Smoked BBQ cheddar. Winner. Game. Over.

1st - Don't get on their calling list. They hounded my wife for weeks with multiple phone calls each day. (That should be a dead give away, but my wife still let them come for a "FREE" inspection)  2nd - OVERPRICED!! I feel that the price we paid for services does not equal the price for parts and labor.  3 Hours of labor at $65/hr would be $195. The parts replaced included a Dual Run Capacitor 60/5 $38.49 a Dual Run Capacitor 50/5 $12.99  and 2 Double Pole / 2 Pole 40 Amp 240v Condenser Contactor Relay $26.99 (53.98) The total at these prices would come to $300.46 plus taxes. Granted, that is Amazon prices, so I called another A/C guy to get a quote. He's quote was out the door $400 including taxes. But he went on to ask if the A/C unit was running. When I told him that it was he asked "Then why do you want to replace those parts?" I told him for maintenance, he said in his opinion that was unnecessary.  So now I feel like I not only paid more than we should have paid, but that the repairs were not even necessary.  We paid $727.32. Ouch. Which was with a "Maintenance plan discount" since we were on some plan...?  3rd - RUDE! I called to complain about the price and explain my reasons for not being satisfied. The first guy tried to sell me on how shocked he was and how much everybody loves them. I asked him to tell me how much the hourly rate was for their techs. He couldn't or wouldn't give me a price per hour. He said, let me see if I can get my boss on the phone. I could then hear the muffled conversation he was having with another guy. "What's his problem???...We aren't as cheap as amazon? DID AMAZON TELL HIM WHAT WAS BROKEN?? Tell him we will call him back."   4th - No follow up call. But wait... I had actually forgotten about this until... Ring. Ring. Ring. They recently started calling again. I answered one of their calls, "Is this the boss or owner that promised to call?"  Not shockingly it was not the owner calling to fix their problem but it was another aggressive salesman trying to sell us on the FREE check up maintenance plan we have with them.
