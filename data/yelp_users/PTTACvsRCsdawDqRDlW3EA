Other than the convenient location to the Diamondbacks stadium I was not impressed. It's continental breakfast consisted of two types of cereal, bagels and coffee with juices. They put me on the backside in the corner closest room to all the construction. Parking was very limited due to the construction. The window in my room looked into the backyard of someone's home. The AC only covered one part of the room and isn't strong enough to cover outside the bathroom and inside of it. Seeing as it's Arizona it was 110 degrees and the AC is highly needed.  The customer service was good.

I been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites. I attended a game against the Atlanta Braves and it was a great experience.  Food prices are typical for any MLB stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper. The bigger the beer the cheaper it seems. There really isn't a bad seat inside the entire place. Get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit. The staff is very friendly and talkative.  If I lived in Arizona I would get season tickets. The merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums. $23 for a hat compared to $41 at Dodgers Stadium.
