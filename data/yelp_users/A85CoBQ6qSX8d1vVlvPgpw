So my boyfriend has been to Canyon Cafe in St. Louis which is owned by the people who own Sam's Cafe and we had been meaning to go for a while so he knew what to expect but I didn't.  The meal started out with the chips and salsa which were pretty amazing.  The salsa had more bite to it than normal salsa you'd get at Macayo's or Arriba's.  The chips were a wide variety that included everything from sweet potato to blue corn to a white corn with a sugar coating.  I got the carnitas platter and my boyfriend got the enchiladas and carnitas dish.  The carnitas were mouthwatering.  The combination of the meat with the guacamole and rice made the tacos to die for.  The cheese used in the enchiladas was rich and mouthwatering.  Different than just the typical cheddar cheese.  For dessert, I had the banana burrito which was okay.  I much prefer the banana tempura at Benihana.  Besides the fact that the food was so good, I give Sam's Cafe 4 stars because I lost a piece of jewelry while dining and the staff helped me find it :)  Definitely would return here.

Compared to the one we used to use in Scottsdale, the employees are a lot friendlier.  The Drive Thru can sometimes be a pain after work and sometimes you see homeless people in the parking lot but it's 24 hrs which is a plus.

I've been seeing Dr. Keightley ever since my family moved here in 1990.  He is simply the best.  His office provides allergy shots in addition to their normal services and I would definitely recommend them to anyone who struggles with allergies,  They greatly improved my quality of life.  Usually if you're sick you can get in the same day or next day and Dr. Keightley is always very generous with samples.

I took my chinchilla here today for a checkup and saw Dr. Ingram. He was very kind and gentle with my little guy and was very thorough. He told me I shouldn't waste my money on unnecessary steps and that if I liked, he could offer me some antibiotic drops to make me feel better but it was my call. I really liked his demeanor and the staff was very kind as well. I would definitely recommend him for anyone with small animals.

This place is fantastic. I had a Philly Cheese steak that was greasy and delicious. They have a pretty varied menu so you're sure to find at least a few things you like.  It's a bar so don't expect it to be quiet, especially on game days but there are lots of families who come here to eat.

This is regarding an experience I had at Outback this past Saturday.  We arrived around 6:30 and were told it would be a 30 mins wait.  We weren't seated until almost an hour later and it only went downhill from there. We all ordered salads with our entrees but the entrees came out before the salads.  What?  Dessert was comped but the food was still medicore.  This is why I try to stay away from chain restaurants.

I've been coming to this practice since we moved to the Valley in 1990 and the doctor before Dr. Dameron took great care of my teeth and Dr. Dameron takes just as great care.  I have a small mouth and he's very considerate, especially when performing procedures.  His staff of hygienists and assistants are very nice and pleasant to deal with.  I would recommend this office to anyone in the Phoenix area looking for a dentist.

Having never been to a spa before I didn't know what to expect coming into Spa Lamar especially since the prices were so much more reasonable than any other spa in Scottsdale.  We arrived early and were given a tour of the place and then shown our lockers and changing rooms and given robes and sandals and taken to the waiting area where our therapists would call our names.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and they have plenty of water and tea for you to drink as well as some fruit.  My friend and I chose the Mid Day Break package as it was moderately priced and offered the services I was looking for in a spa day.  The massage was very nice. The therapist adjusted the pressure to my liking and helped me feel loose.  Next was the facial, which I've never experienced before but the facialist helped me feel very serene and peaceful.   And last, my friend and I were able to have our manicures together.  Afterwards we experimented with the sauna and steam room before using the pool and jacuzzi and showering and leaving.  No one ever pressured us to leave and we paid when we felt ready to leave and put the gratuity on our tab.  This is definitely a place where the service exceeds the prices. If you're looking for great services at a great price, come check this place out.

I love the Good Egg.  Every time we come here, no matter what day of the week, they always take care of you.  My boyfriend and I visited most recently last Friday before Christmas and we were in and out in an hour.  They have prompt waiter service and are on the same level of service as First Watch.  Pick this place over The Breakfast Joynt any day!  They're famous for their cinnamon rolls which are the size of a plate (literally) but I haven't had a bad dish from this place.

I'm updating this to a 1 instead of a 3 because in the two weeks since I got my nails done, they chipped and peeled significantly and I went and got them redone elsewhere.  I would also like to state that Jeannie commented on here that she would give me a gift certificate to come back and get my nails done and after I messaged her I never heard back from her.

Why does this place only have an average of three stars?  My boyfriend and I try to come here at least once a month and their punch cards makes it worth it when you get enough punches for a free meal :) I'm not a big egg fan so I usually get pancakes or french toast which are always on par.  Their service is always fast and efficient so you can't get much better than this place!

I love this Safeway.  It's right down the street from our house and they always have a great selection of produce and products that we enjoy.  They recently started carrying the soy yogurt I love which is a plus and Rochelle is probably the best cashier around.

Downside - They're closed on Mondays - They don't have a drive thru - parking can be a pain  Otherwise it's a nice branch, everything is self service and checkout but there are employees in case you need to ask questions.

I came and got my eyelash extensions done on Saturday by Valerie.  I had a Groupon and I was really excited to try them as the normal rate is too much for me to afford.  I arrived on time and was taken care of right away.  Valerie is a sweet girl who has pretty decent taste in music and was very friendly.  She asked me what I wanted and I wasn't quite sure because I'd never had extensions done before but I love the end result and they are so noticeable.  I definitely agree with Deep Blue's review.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking to get this service done.

We've only been here once but we fell in love right away. The waiting area is very clean and well done. They even have a parrot named Nacho who talks! Although he didn't seem very talkative the other day. Our vet tech was Melissa who was very sweet and caring with our kitten. She took very good care of him! Our vet was Dr. D'Monte who we instantly loved. She took the time to listen to us and ask us questions and she spent a good half hour or more trying to diagnose why our cat was excessively crying at night. In the end, her recommendation was the same as ours.   I like their principles and that they have aromatherapy pumped into the office to help calm the animals. I think it helped calm our kitten a little :)   Although they're 20 mins away from where we live, we will definitely be making this our permanent vet :)

Had to come back here yesterday because our dog hurt himself over the weekend.  We had the same vet and while we had to wait about 3 hrs (walk in only, no appointments) she was very kind and gentle with our dog.  Very happy with the service!

The first time I ate here last year I would have given them 5 stars, but tonight they got 1 star for the following reasons.  1. It took over an hour to get our appetizer and food.  Our appetizer came out only moments before our food. 2. It took another 45 mins to get our check and leave 3. The waiter barely touched our table  The only plus is that complaining to the manager is that we got our appetizer comped.  Needless to say we're never coming back.

I heard about this medical practice because it's right by my work and it's where my father goes. I've been here twice now and I love my doctor. She's very kind and professional and walks you through the exams so you don't feel uncomfortable. They're very good about getting you in same day in case you need an appt ASAP. Their entire staff is friendly. I would recommend this practice to any and all my friends. The only thing is that they charge a $60 administrative fee that they're very clear about on their website and up front on your first visit. This fee accounts for paperwork and the convenience of being able to schedule same day appointments. Several people from my work also go to this practice and have nothing but nice things to say about it. Don't let $60 dissuade you from amazing health care!

I was first turned onto Chino's when I worked at Honeywell 5 years ago and I've been hooked ever since. Their amazing infusion of Chinese and Mexican amongst other types of food is what keeps me coming back. The number of possible combinations is limitless.  Some people may comment on the cleanliness of the place.  All I have to say is in the 5 years I've been a customer I haven't had one complaint.  Take it from me, this place is perfect for the out of towner or first timer.

Stopped by here after my friend got a tattoo at Golden Rule and this food is amazing.  Their menu for lunch is pretty simple, a list of sandwiches and some appetizers.  My friend got a wrap and I got the Cuban along with some orzo pasta salad.  DELICIOUS! I don't know why this place doesn't have better reviews but it definitely hit the spot.

I got a sandwich delivered from here on Friday that I ordered from Living Social.  I got a toasted ham and cheese with a cookie and a side of pasta salad.  The sandwich was really good and the mustard gave it just a hint of sweetness.  The pasta salad was delicious and the cookie was still warm and gooey. I would definitely order from them again.

I don't know why everyone hates on this Walgreens.  This is the only pharmacy I go to since moving to the area.  Sometimes the drive thru is a hassle but usually I can get in and out pretty fast and they have whatever you could possibly need.

So I've only been living in North Scottsdale since November on the *other* side of Scottsdale Rd. for most of my life. Getting fed up with my nails chipping after a few days of being painted I recently decided I would start getting regular manicures so my nails always looked superb. I live at Thompson Peak Pkwy and FLW so I have plenty of nail salons to choose from but on Saturday picked Paulene's Nails because it was on my way to running errands. I got in and was seated right away. For the most part, my experience wasn't half bad until the nail tech asked me if I was pregnant (either for lack of conversation or just to be rude because I have never been asked this in my life) to which I just kind of got a sour experience from there on out. She criticized my choice in color (black on Valentine's Day) and was asking questions about my boyfriend and I that were frankly none of her business. She was chattier than any other tech I've ever had. She ended up slightly injuring one of my nails from filing them down or perhaps cleaning them.   It's just a small cut that has practically healed but not something I should be receiving when I get my nails done.  A simple manicure cost $15 (not terrible) but they wanted $38 for a mani AND a pedi which is WAY too much in my opinion.  Needless to say I will be looking elsewhere for my manicure next time.

Why does this place have so many poor reviews?  Their pizza is greasy and delicious and their wings are hot and spicy.  Yes, it costs more to get pizza from here than say Pizza Hut but the quality is so much better.  We live down the street from here and have gotten delivery and pick up and they're always quick and have never gotten lost finding our place.

We went here for my birthday last night (9-25-11) because they were participating in Restaurant Week.  I had never even heard of the place before last week.  The restaurant is small but quaint. They were offering a sampler menu with 3 courses as part of their RW promotion.  I skipped the butter lettuce salad as I'm not a big veggie person but my boyfriend and parents enjoyed it.  The chilled gazpatcho was a little odd.  I ordered the fried chicken for dinner which was delicious and I got the root beer float for dessert.  All in all it was a great meal and I'd love to come back and visit.

I've been to Blanco twice and I haven't been thrilled with the food either time.  Their chips and salsa are just okay.  I feel like their salsa lacks flavor.  I usually order the carne asada tacos which are nothing to write home about.  Their house rice is very creamy and not like most Mexican rice dishes I've tasted.

Some coworkers and I went here on Friday night for Happy Hour.  $4.50 soft pretzel appetizer? Yes please!  I'm a sucker for any place with soft pretzels.  I had the chorizo mac and cheese which was spicy but incredibly flavorful.  I would definitely dine here again but get a reservation next time!

This place is horrible. My bf and I stopped here because we had a groupon but it wasn't worth it. We watched as other people got seated before us even though our name was on the list. It took about 10-15 mins to get waited on and then almost an hour to get our food. Our waitress didn't stop to check on us once or apologize for the wait. The people next to us were being completely ignored by their waitress and waited an hour for food as well. It took forever as well to get the check. Maybe they should be better prepared for a Saturday morning. You couldn't pay me to come back here.

I decided to start going here after finding it was in my network, close to work, had a decent website and had really good reviews on Yelp.  I hadn't been to a chiropractor in several months and needed to establish myself with someone.  Dr. Frank took about an hour in the intake appointment to go over my entire medical history and chart discussing everything in detail.    I'm hoping my aches and pains will start to subside now that I'm getting adjustments and massages on a regular basis.  If you're looking for a chiropractic office that encompasses all levels of care (PT, massage therapy, acupuncture) then look no further.

This place is delicious.  They had these back in Missouri but they closed out of St. Louis. I'm so glad they opened one in Phoenix! I love donut shops that make their donuts in house and have a wide variety to choose from. If I lived closer, I'd be about 50 lbs overweight from eating here all the time. Beats DD and Krispy Kreme any day.

I started coming here once I switched hair salons and needed someone to wax my eyebrows.  After a while, I decided to start getting my legs waxed as well.  Never having to shave my legs is such a relief!  Rachel is a pro and it hardly hurts when she pulls the hairs out.  I try and recommend European Wax Center to any woman I know, especially because first time visitors get a free wax, no strings attached!  You can't beat that!

Just stopped by this place today after working out this morning. Decided on a whim to get a pedicure and I was pleasantly surprised.  This place is clean and they got me in pretty quick. My pedicure ended up costing $37 (before tip) and included a very through leg massage, callus removal, sugar scrub and neck massage.  Very swanky!  For what i paid, I feel like I got more than what you normally get at a nail salon.

I wish I could say that Tasty House was both tasty and delicious but sadly, I didn't even get to eat my meal.  We place a delivery order via phone at 6:30 and they told us 40-50 mins....no big deal.   At 7:30, the driver called because he was lost.  I gave him the gate code and he said he was okay.  Fast forward a bit, after over 15 phone calls between me, the driver and the restaurant, it is now 8pm and we still don't have our food.  The driver is clearly lost, I have no idea where he is and since he doesn't speak very good English, he has no way to tell me where he is.    I called the restaurant to let them know that he's very lost and at this point we just want to cancel our order, get a refund and go somewhere else.  The man on the phone kept telling me to "hold on" so he could contact the driver and kept insisting he was "5 mins" away.  At this point, our food would have been so cold it wouldn't have mattered.  After I finally told him I didn't want to wait anymore and just wanted a refund, he told me I would have to wait for a delivery drive to bring me cash back...apparently he didn't know how to configure a refund.  We ended up driving out of our way to go and get the cash back because we didn't want to deal with the charge back.  Turns out they had entered my address incorrectly into their system which is why the driver was completely lost...although I had repeated my address several times and never heard them admit an error.  I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone and I have never had such a poor experience as I have had tonight.

We took my parents here on Saturday for Father's Day to try something new. We got there around 6:30 and didn't have to wait for a table. We got seated immediately. Now, I'm a nondrinker so I can't really rate the drinks but their cocktail list is insane.   We started with the soft pretzels with provolone fondue which was TO DIE FOR. So delicious and flavorful. I recommend it to everyone.   We also ordered some cheese and meat off the antipasti menu which was delicious as well. The cheese was very moist and flavorful and the capicola had just enough pepper to give it a hint of spice.   For entrees, I ordered the short rib pasta which had delicious flavorful short rib in a yummy red sauce. It wasn't too heavy or too light. Just right. My boyfriend ordered the MAC burger which is basically just a glorified Big Mac only better. My mom got the smoked chicken salad and my dad ordered the coq au vin. Everyone seemed to be happy with their choices.   We had to skip on dessert because we were so full after wards but I can't wait to come back and try some more delicious food!

I visited this Danny's for an interior detailing back in February. Upon completion, I noticed that the 5 CD's that were in my side door pockets were missing...along with everything else that had been in my side doors.  I sent an email through their website notifying them that they had either been stolen or thrown away on accident and asked for $40 to replace them.  I spent almost two weeks emailing back and forth with Heather who is the VP of Operations.  She sent me several emails asking for more details (ex: where were the CD's? Was there a plastic bag of personal belongings left in my car? What CD's were there?)  In the end, Heather quoted company policy basically saying I was at fault for leaving valuables in my car and that the company isn't liable for anything that happens to my car after they take possession.  She offered me a $50 gift card as an apology but needless to say I will not be visiting Danny's ever again and I will tell everyone I know to steer clear.  I hope my technician is enjoying my Justin Timberlake CD.

I was really excited when I saw that Big Daddy's would be opening up by Shea and 101 ever since Bad to the Bone (at Scottsdale Promenade) closed a couple months ago and Scottsdale was lacking a good BBQ place. We tried this out on Friday and it blew me away.  When you're walking up to the place you can smell the wood fire and deliciousness. The decor makes you feel like you're down South enjoying some home cooking. The dining room style of picnic tables and the open air seating is very refreshing and even when it's night and still 80 degrees out, you can feel the fresh night air.   They have a variety of dishes to choose from. Since it was my first time I decided to go with the Slider combo so I could try 3 different kinds of meat. Their sauce is unbelievable and their meat is tasty. Their sweet tea is also delicious. I choose their Mac and cheese as my side and that almost filled me up alone. It was so cheesy and tender and fresh. It reminded me of the Emeril's four cheese recipe I've used at home before. Definitely recommend everyone try it!   My only gripe with the restaurant, and my reason this received 4 stars instead of 5, is because of their lack of cornbread. Out of the 4 people in my dining party, only one of us received cornbread and when I went to the counter to ask for more, all I received was another piece. There was no "side" option to choose for more corn bread or a way for me to purchase a plate. I just figured it wouldn't kill them to give everyone a piece and provide at least a PLATE of their mouth watering cornbread.   But if that's my only gripe with the place then I think they're doing good.

I found this place via Google and then decided on them based on their prices and all their 5 star reviews on Yelp.  Sharie was my nail tech and spent about 2.5 hrs doing my pedicure and manicure and I loved every minute of it.  I decided on rock star toes and a shellac/gelish manicure and I wanted a Halloween motif so she worked with me to find colors that worked.  She was very gentle and did an awesome job.  This place definitely prides themselves on the personal touch.  I will absolutely recommend them to everyone I know.

This was the first in class workout I've ever tried and I fell in love.  Pure Barre works you harder than anything else I've tried.  My muscles are shaking every session (which is the point).  I suggest everyone tries at least one class.  You don't have to have any dance experience and you see results within 2-3 sessions.  My butt is firmer and my arms are buffer.  Take a class with Marirose or Veronica Weyand to make your workout extra intense!

I had a groupon for this place that was about to expire so we decided to check this out on Tuesday night.  The place is really small compared to other yogurt places we've visited and they only had about 7-8 flavor choices.  Their toppings bar wasn't much better in terms of selection.  Like Dave said, if you're in the area, you're better off visiting Yogurtology or Sweet Republic.

We went here because we had a Living Social deal and are always in the mood to try something new.  Granted, we went an hour before closing so the service was lackluster but the food was delicious!  I had the chicken street tacos which were so juicy and moist I didn't know what to do with myself.  The chicken was tender and flavorful and unlike any street taco I'd have before.  Their house rice is super yummy with the added cheese.  Their house chips and salsa are yummy although the salsa is on the spicy side.  We would definitely come back.

Went here on Sunday to see an early morning showing of Chronicle.  I hadn't been to this theater since it was a United Artist (I think, right?) back in the day.  Boy, have things changed!  After stopping off at the refreshment stand and the espresso bar we sat in our theater (in the Ultraluxe section).  There was only one other person in there besides us so we got our pick of the litter.  The seats were plush leather recliners and probably the most comfortable seats I've ever been in.  I'd still pick Harkins just for the pricing structure but might consider renting out a VIP room here someday.

I went here to try something different from my salon.  I used to go to Aloosion's on Scottsdale and Shea and Jen used to cut my boyfriend's hair.  I wanted to try some crazy color so I decided to visit Jen Haldeman here at Jo Paris.  She's done an excellent job with my hair.  Her prices are very comparable to what I Was paying before and very reasonable for Scottsdale.  She got me from copper red to light blonde in one session without damaging my hair.  True magic!

Such a great concept they combine my two favorite things about a trip to the salon, a shampoo and style!  It's nearly impossible for me to style my hair this effortlessly at home so when I saw the Groupon I had to buy it.  I went and had my blowout done yesterday morning and after sleeping on it, some of the curls on one side are sort of droopy but all I had to do was pick through my hair and it still looks great!  I've gotten so many compliments at work today about it :)  I would definitely come back again

The first time we came here was in August and if I would have written a review based on that visit, I would have given them 1 star for the poor service that we received.  I called and spoke with the manager after that visit and he apologized and offered to send me a gift card to have us come back and try his restaurant again.  We went again last night, different server, and the service was much better.  The salsa and bean dip they bring out with the tostada chips is heavenly.  Their guac appetizer is pretty good.  Their tacos are to die for.  Both times I've gotten the street tacos and I have not been disappointed.  There is so much flavor in their food and everything is really fresh.  Their Mexican rice is super amazing too.  I would definitely come back here again.

I've been to this place three times and I've been happy with the service each time. They can accommodate pretty much any nail design you want and their prices are reasonable.  The location is great and right in Old Town Scottsdale but it's slightly hidden so keep an eye out.  I love the fact that I can make reservations online too.

This place catered to my work last week and I loved it so much I had to go back this weekend.  I got the Wicked which is 5 meats and 3 cheeses, including bacon. Delicious!  Hands down, the best sandwich I've ever had.  Plus they have delicious cookies and shakes.

I started going here the day it opened in January and I haven't stopped yet. The teachers here are very friendly and awesome. Each class will make you work harder than the class before utilizing different moves each time.  This helps reduce burnout because the choreography is constantly changing. If you're curious about checking the studio out, your first class is free and their packages are very reasonably priced.

This review is not about the food so much as it is about the service.  Here are my main complaints: 1. When I ordered my donuts, I was informed that I would have to wait a few mins for fresh glaze donuts.  That's fine.  My problem was that after I had paid for my order, I still didn't have my donuts. They were sitting on the counter because the girl had forgotten about them.  I had to remind another employee that I was waiting for my donuts. 2. When we were being rung up, I had to repeat what we had several times.  I told her we had iced coffees but she thought we had brewed coffees. 3.  The girl making our iced coffees made mine too watery with too much milk and it was warm on top of that.    For them being open a month, they still have a long ways to go in customer service.

I love this place.  I started coming here in March and haven't stopped.  Each time I know I put my all into the workout and didn't just skate by.  All of the instructors are great and friendly, especially with helping you correct your form.  If you're looking for an easy workout, this isn't it.  If you want to work hard and feel a difference, look no further.

We put in a work order through our home warranty company to have our garage door looked at because it's been causing us problems since we moved in.  Kyle came out on Saturday and diagnosed it as a bad computer board.  The part came in and he was back out on Wed to replace it.  Both visits were relatively quick and now it works like a charm! Thanks!

I've been coming to Eastwind since it was Tokyo Express years ago.  I love this place although I never eat the sushi.  I love their miso soup and their teriyaki chicken.  It's always consistently good.  My boyfriend usually gets the bento box which he loves and allows him to sample a variety of different foods at once.
