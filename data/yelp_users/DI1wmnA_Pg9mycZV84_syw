When I moved to Phoenix my dad gave me his 1995 Mercedes e320 convertable for me to enjoy in the desert climate. Since he does not get to have much fun with it in Ohio. The one condition was that I never take it to a hack mechanic. This car is his pride and joy (after my sister and I, of course) so I took this serious. However, it took a break down on the side of Thomas Road and frantic Google search to find this place. And so glad that happened, because this place is fantasic! They always do a good job, they offer rentals and pick up/drop off service. Everyone there is extremely nice and helpful. And they will go through everything with you before doing any work or charging you for a service. And as any Mercedes owner will tell you that is a nice, since these are never cheap stops. Also they give you a free coffee mug after every service..I have an Audi and Mercedes mug now.   They service all European cars. Audi, BMW, Mercedes,etc..

I am new to the area. And Einstein Bros is not in Cincinnati as far as I know. Before this I have only had it once in DC and liked it. But they have pretzel bagels. And pretzel bagels are my favorite kind. It takes the best of both worlds, the pretzel world and the bagel one. And I love their cream cheese. It is light and fluffy. Plus it actually fills me up. As far as service and other conditions of the place. Eh I never been too bothered to notice. The guy who takes my orders now remembers my name, which is a nice touch.

I started going to Elite Cleaners because it is so close to my house. And never dawned on me to write a review since most people go to closest dry cleaners to their house. But there yelp page seemed unloved so I took one for the team and wrote the first review.   The women who work here are super nice. They do an excellent job with both laundry and dry cleaning. And the price is not to bad for dry cleaning, I recently picked up 15 articles both dry cleaning/laundry and it was 30 bucks! And that was before my discount as a returning customer.   The only downside is that this place shares a parking lot with Arcadia Grill. Which I have never been too but based on their lack of parking and over use of valet service means lack of parking. So just dont expect to pick up your laundry durning lunch time. Though there is a drop off only parking spot, but just one. So here is hoping luck is on your side if you do try to pick it up durning lunch.

I wanted this to be great. I love Persian food. And the food here is really good. And I would totally eat it again, if it was not for having to go to the actual restaurant to eat. The service was so below par that it was actually hilarious. First, we were greeted and seated quickly. Which was very nice and the hostess was very polite. So far so good. Then we were told our waiter would be right with us. So we waited....  and waited....  waited........  finally, my friend asked a waiter that we would like to order. But this boorish lady with a Russian accent said "I will will get him". First, why do you need to get him. You were folding napkins (slowly, I might add) before we called you over. You could have taken our order and then told our waiter. Or at least, said with a nicer tone. I felt like we had just signed the death warrant for our waiter. And when she arrived, she was very pleasant and apologized for the wait. We ordered our meals and drinks. My beer and my other friend's ice tea arrived quickly. But my other friend's wine just didnt arrive. The excuse we got was "we don't have a bartender tonight, the manager is finding it".  Then she left. And we never saw her again. Our appetizer arrived and our main courses. But still no wine! Finally, we got someone over here, just for them to run off to get the manager. So another guy arrives and we get the wine. By the time, he poured the glasses, he was already gone from the table. And no surprise because the wine was bad.   Then as we chatted, with plates just sitting in front of us. And that Russian mob woman back to her napkins.   Then the "manager" arrived with our check. And told us our waitress had to leave. See what I told you?! Totally signed her death warrant with that Russian mob lady.   No apologies, no nothing. So while the food was good. I would just stay away, I mean the restaurant was half empty when we went and it was midweek. I can not imagine this place when it is busy.  So two stars because the food was great but just like how one F can ruin your GPA, the service just ruined it for us.

Strip mall, taxi cab armada parked out front, not knowing exactly what your getting into. That is fine dining hole in the wall style.   Basically that sums up of the reviews of Juba on Yelp. But I wanted to throw in my two cents because I now have a new favorite place to eat near my new apartment. While I never tried to ice tea, I was glad that I read up on this place on Yelp before going just so that I dont come off as a Sudanese restaurant noob. Since I knew not to ask for lamb at dinner (since they run out around 3) and that they will be out of your first pick so have a second one lined up when your order. All of which happened when I went to Juba.   I went with the exotic sounding "Number 10" which turned out to look like Sudanese hamburger helper but tasted nothing like that crap in the box with the talking oven mitt. Huge portion of "rice pasta" (still not sure if misprint or what) covered in a delicious red sauce with chicken and vegetables. Oh and it was served in a Texas sized portion so I had plenty for leftovers. My dad had the lamb shank. Which was tasty but a little too fatty for this fat kid. But the rice and the bread were amazing and the owner who was hilarious. When asked if he took credit cards he said (and I quote) "Of course I do, this is America!!!" (image a small Sudanese man channeling his inner Broadway diva with a smile to boot). And it was cheap like wicked cheap. Plus when we went there was a soccer game (I mean, football match). And the place was filled with Newcastle fans from Sudan. Which was just great hearing trash talk in a language you don't hear often. I am guessing they were Newcastle fans since that is the only word I understood. Though since I don't know Arabic, Newcastle could mean something incredibly dirty that one should not say to a loved one. So take your pick.   Anyway, go to Juba. Try the food and enjoy because not many places in America have a local "Sudanese place". So you better feel lucky that you do, Phoenix.

There are very few restaurants that make me sit back and think about how I should be kinder to chain restaurants when I write reviews. And Les 3 Brasseurs was one of the those lucky few. While there is not way to avoid chain restaurants all the time. I try to support local places. So bare with me as I explain to you why I love this place.   I was in Montreal for the weekend, visiting friends from Uni. I was also there with a friend from Cincinnati, taking him on his first Canadian adventure. On our first night, we were on our own and up to our devices for getting dinner. We chose Les 3 Brasseurs mostly because they brewed their own beer. I mean as a beer lover, that is just heaven for me. We got placed at the bar because it was a crowded Friday night. The bartender was very attentive and very beautiful. She was more then happy to speak English. And she pretty much gave us a college level course on their beer selection. We went with two liters of the Amber. I mean we were planning on drinking, might as well go "balls to the wall". Along with our beer, we ordered their Poutine. And while I try not to explain food as orgasmic. A plate of their poutine maxi is just that, orgasmic. My friend had the open faced seafood sandwich. And I ordered the Quebec Flammekuchen. Covered in a local cheese,bacon and onion. It was so good. We became friends with a few of our fellow bar sitters. And with the assistant to the bartender, he wasn't a busboy and he was allowed to take orders, just not pour them. Weird? Anyway. We kept ordering beer and shots of Sortilege ( a wonderful maple bourbon that is just amazing). Before we knew it, it was 2am. And we were very well gone. So with a few of our new friends we met at Les 3, we moved to a cheaper drinking hole. And the rest of the night is kinda blurry after that. But I will always eat here when I am in Montreal. Hell, until I find a better place. This will be my favorite place to eat in Montreal! Bring on the flame war.

Since moving here, I needed to find the perfect "special dinner" place. You know what I mean, we all have one. It is our go to place for a special event, birthday, date or family visit. And while I have not had that many special events yet, I have had some family visits. And my parents only stay at the Saguaro hotel when they come to Phoenix. But more on that later.   So whenever they are in town, we will go to The Mission. It is just a great place for a nice dinner without it being too stuffy. While every meal I have had there has been great, I cant honestly remember what I ate. But I do remember the guacamole. As a fat foodie, I love when a dish is prepared table side. And they do this for the guacamole, and it is the best guacamole I have ever had. How do I know this? I hate guacamole. I try to never eat on purpose, but when I go to The Mission that part of me dies. And I inhale this stuff. So you have to try the guacamole is what I am getting at. And order their house margarita or their Blood Orange margarita (if it is still on the menu). Another thing that becomes costly, because they go down so smooth and taste so good before you know it your a little drunk.   I have never had service problems. And both times I have gone, it has been packed. And while it does get loud, you can still hear yourself. Try to get a seat outside in the back. Nothing fancy about it but it just a great outside setting that is not patio or Jimmy Buffet themed (sorry, tex-mex places with outdoor seating usually go down the Buffet route).   Also the drinks are not watered down. Trust me.

This review has nothing to do with Dr.Levins. I never met him, so I can not say how good of a doctor he is. But based on the other reviews, he must be great. This review is about his staff. And only his staff.   Let me begin with why I was looking for a doctor. I had severe pain in my lower back. A burning kind of pain. Quite unpleasant. Basically if I was not standing or sitting at exactly 90 degrees, I was in heaps of pain. And this occurred over Labor Day weekend. So I could not call and get an appointment on Monday. And yes, I knew I could have gone to a walk in clinic. but I needed to find a primary care doc since I will be staying in AZ for awhile. So I thought I could kill two birds with one stone. So I read all the reviews on Yelp. Thought this is the guy for me and went on Tuesday.   And then it began.....  I walked in and  up to the window (now remember I am in a lot of pain) and the woman behind the window just stares at me. No hello, hi, howdy. Nothing. Just a pissed off stare. So I break the ice with "I would like to see a doctor". Her response "Appointment?". I told her I did not have one since I only needed to see the doctor because of some pain I had over the weekend and the day before was a holiday. All I got was "no" and she left her chain and walked away. Then another woman showed up. Even more snarly then the one before. And she said "Do you have an appointment?" and I repeated "No. but can I make one or see the doctor, because I am in pain". Is what I meant to say, what came out was "no" before she interrupted and said "Dr.Levin cant see you today, how about another doctor in the afternoon". Well, I was in pain so I couldnt wait till the afternoon. And after all that I just wanted to leave. So I did.   Here is what they did wrong:  1. No gretting - it is called basic human empathy. For f*cks sake say "Hi" before your rude to me  2. Never inquired why I was there or if I was in any pain. Your a doctor's office, I am not there for chit chat.   3. Never tried to help me find another doctor to visit. This could only have happened if they asked more questions then appoint time.   4. Snappy questions and comebacks. Seriously, you are in customer service along with medical care. You need to be polite.   Now for all those who say "well, that is what you get for going after a holiday". Okay that is a okay excuse but they could have told me that is why they were so snappy. "Sorry, we are just really busy since it was a holiday yesterday, Can we schedule another day or do you need to see a doctor now" easy straight forward answer they could have given. Then some might say "Well this review hurts Dr.Levin, why not go again and then right the review for him". I am not trying to hurt Dr.Levin. But my mom ran her own practice and her staff were always polite. Because they are the first thing the patient sees. This is not rocket science.   Now am I demanding anyone to be fired? No, I would never do that. I just wish Dr.Levin would read this and explain to his staff that there are words will more syllables than two. And that maybe some human decency because I don't know maybe because you work with SICK PEOPLE!!!   So I will never return. I will just need to find a primary care doctor elsewhere. It is a shame, because based on the other reviews, he seems like a good doctor.

Honestly, I have no idea what a good doggie daycare place is. Since this is the first and only one I visited.  And to continue down the path of honesty, I am still a shamed that I pay for a daycare for my dog. But I love my dog. And I like to see him happy and he loves it here. The crew that works here treat him like a little prince. They also greet him and give him special attention when he arrives. I actually have a this countdown when I about to let him out of the car because he runs so fast to get inside that someones I cant hold on to his lead.   And I know that it is not some prison of war camp for dogs. Because he hates to leave. He "cries" whenever we leave. Trust me, it uses up all your feels in one go when you see that. And I am saying that a manly bearded no emotions kind of man. It is a little costly but they have a buy 10 get 11 visits program that helps with that. And Tanuki (my dog) only goes 2-3 times a week. So I don't run through my visits that fast. And they are great for boarding as well! Since I travel a lot and do a lot of weekend trips that sometimes mean he needs to board ed, I know I can trust Tailwinds for a spot for my little bruiser.

Since I live along this park, it has been a nice place for walks and such. But since my dog has discovered it, an afternoon/morning/late night walk is not finished unless we go to Cross Cut. So if you see an over excited boston terrier with a less then overly excited owner walking around there multiple times during the day that is me.

This last sunday, one of my best friends was having his birthday dinner at Hulus. And since I have never been to a tiki bar outside out Japan or Hawaii (the one in Japan was just a Hawaiiian islands bar but same thing) so I was ready to see what Hulus had to offer.   The atmosphere is not over the top tiki but it could use a few more statues. They have a nice patio area which would be nice but it was too cold to use. But lets jump to the heart of the matter, that is the drinks. Oh my. Rum is one of my strong vices. Add fruit juice and I would mostly likly drink it out of a shoe. But besides the fact that sentence shows some crippling alcoholicsm, I dont get to indulge in rum beverages very often. But they had my favorite "Dark and Stormy" which had Ginger Beer as the main mixer instead of juice. And this was mixed perfectly, so much so that it gave off a Dark and Tan floating illusion. I would go back just for that.   How about the food? Man can not survive on rum alone. But dammit we try,   The food was very good. Three people I was sitting next to got the Tofu bowl and raved about it. The one guy who got the chicken was also pleased. I got the Calamari burger just because I never seen a Calamari burger before. And it was to be expected. It needed to be bit more spicy and a lot more crunchy but still good, since I ate it all.   Basically....they do a great Dark and Stormy. And if that doesnt get you go then nothing wil.

This place quickly became my favorite bar in Scottsdale. The staff are always amazing and are ready to recommend a drink. The bartenders treat their job like a profession not just a cool job. So they know their stuff and their drinks. John, the bar manager, is a great guy to talk to. In fact, I should go back when he is working and pick his brain some more about tending bar. Seriously, when my Dad and I were there. He just told us all about tending bar and all the cool things he learned. And as someone who is getting into the hotel industry, I might need this knowledge at some point. And go during Happy Hour, which starts at 3. Great drink specials. Cant speak on the food, only had it once. But the menu has changed a lot since then.   Drink of Choice at Old Town Whiskey: Moscow Mule  Because it is made in the traditional old copper cup. Which makes  it taste better, I swear it does. Also it made with my favorite Ginger Beer from Australia, which is always hard to find here in the US. Must remind myself to ask them where they get it.

This place reminds me of the local sushi place that I lived above while I was teaching English in Japan. Nothing fancy, just good sushi that is not horribly expensive. Is it the best sushi in town? No. But it comes to you on a conveyor belt! How can you not like that.   They have a location in Tempe/Chandeler (off Priest/Ray) and it is also as good. But this one had the best selection I have seen since I started coming to this "chain".
