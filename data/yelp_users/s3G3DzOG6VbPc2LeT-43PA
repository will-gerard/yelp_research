Very fast service! I went in at 1:50 to get an oil change and was paid and out of there by 2:10. I went in knowing they'd try to upsell me seeing I am a young female. To my surprise they actually didn't try to sell me a million things. Yes of course they told me what they think I should fix but it was no pressure at all! I will always come here for oil changes. Only down fall was it was $50 for a simple oil change.

A little hidden gem! I must admit this is my favorite place for sushi so far in az! I have been to plenty "high end" sushi joints and this one blows then away! Amazing fresh sushi for a good price! Their happy hour menu is perfect, it has almost everything on there that you would normally order. It's not just crappy rolls. Service is beyond good every time I go. If you want good sushi for a cheap cost this is the place. Last Friday I went with a group of friends together we ordered a Las Vegas roll, rainbow roll, California roll, edamame, miso soup, and 5 sake bombs are tab was only $45!!! Highly recommend this place over anywhere else!

Ok first of all, if you order a side of eel sauce they will give you a side of teriyaki sauce... We asked the waitress why she gave us the teriyaki sauce when we asked for eel sauce and she said that's what they always do... Obviously to save money because they're so cheap!!! All of their speciality rolls have spicy tuna in them.. Because again they're cheap. The saki bombs all come out in plastic cups... Again because they're cheap. If you want some nice sushi, stay away from this place. All you get here is cheap cheap cheap for pretty expensive rolls and drinks.

I had received a flat tire yesterday and went to Costcos tire center at first because I had been there before. He told me they didn't have my tire in stock but to go to a discount tire and printed me a quote so they could match that price. They had said $175 for one tire. I knew that 3 of my tires would need replacing as well considering they are old. When I arrived here he agreed that I would need 3 and asked me if I had a price range I wanted to stick in, me being in sales appreciated that because it didn't make me feel pressured or being up sold. I gave him the quote from Costco and immediately said I will give you a better deal then that. Needless to say I only paid $219 for 3 tires! Awesome service and it took less than 30 minutes. I now know where I will be coming in the future for my tires!

Food was ok nothing spectacular for the price. The Vegas roll was not on the menu but the chef made it for us. I do admit that was nice and it was a good roll. The specialty drinks were good as well. We were here for a friends bday and this is when it went downhill. It took 15 minutes to receive our drinks, it took so long we would order our second round before even finishing our first. Our server rarely came around and was not very educated. Sadly I am giving them two stars not for the food but for the service we received. With paying that much for a meal/drinks I expect much more then what sushi roku provided. I do not think I will be back.

Whenever I have the gambling itch this is my go to casino! During the day it is not so busy but I went at night for my first time on a Saturday and it was packed! I only play black jack which is good because they have plenty of tables. Typically when I go during the day they have more $5 tables then anything so when I went on Saturday I was somewhat disappointed to find no $5 tables. I ended up playing a $10 table which actually benefited me more considering I won $300 only playing $100! I went with my parents and they were wanting to play let it ride..well they only had one table that was packed so we had to wait a good hour until we were able to play. That is my only bad thing to say about this casino. Ps you will see a lot of younger kids in bathing suits considering there is always a big pool party.

Been coming here almost once a week now, it's so Yummy! The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is casual. I always get the Vegas roll and it is the best one I've ever had! They have this grey sauce on the side that is good it's addicting. For the quality of the sushi the price is insane! I say that because it is inexpensive. Strongly recommend

I've been coming here for years and I go to Amy every time. She pays close attention to details. I always come in with a complicated nail design off of Pinterest and she makes my nails look better then the picture! If you like complicated designs I highly recommend Amy!

Went for Father's Day not too sure what to expect and was completely blown away. They showed us right away how to get set up. You can practice on the virtual range first which they suggested so you can get the hang of it. The range will track where your balls go every time, useful so you can see your direction. They had a ton of courses to pick from. We did 9 holes and it was so much fun! You can be a terrible golfer and still enjoy it. Only suggestion would be to add food! I had to munch on a snickers

Been coming here for about 8 years now and every time I come it's surprisingly a pleasant experience! The front desk employees make you feel comfortable with their personable attitudes. They treat you like family. I hadn't been in in a few years(terrible I know) but they acted as if they missed me! It was that little touch that makes you feel comfortable being at a dentist. Turns out I have to get a root canal.

I am only giving it two stars for the reason that I have yet to have a bad experience up until this Saturday. Me and a group of friends went here looking to dance and have a good time for our buddies bday. After about an hour of being there we were outside when a bouncer by the name of Jesse approached the bday boy and asked for his id.. We were confused at this because he said he was "swaying" we had been there for an hour no one was that intoxicated!! In no way were we making a scene. One of my girlfriends had approached them and asked what was wrong. Jesse the bouncer looked at her and said "ITS BITCHES LIKE YOU THAT DONT LET ME FINISH" that right there is what set me off. In no way shape or form should any man talk to a woman like that. The manager was called and he did nothing about the situation at this point we wanted to get out! I have gone to Toby's every thurs night and on the weekends I will never return to this establishment. Also I will make sure people know what Jesse said and how "management" handled it, disgusting!

Found this place on Yelp and I am so happy we did. Me and my boyfriend were looking for a place that isn't a vape shop that constantly up sells and charges ridiculous prices, and we found it here. The inside is decorated rustic and is one of the nicest looking vape shops I have been to. They were so knowledgeable and knew everything! The number one thing I liked was they shook your hand when coming in and leaving! That is excellence customer service and leaves a lasting impression. This will be my go to vape store

Went here for my first time and I fell in love. The decor is amazing just like every fox restaurant. The Henry however is a more relaxed casual feeling but yet still manages to be high class. We went for breakfast and ordered the brûlée grapefruit, smoked salmon, sample of pastries. Yeah that was just our appetizers! The smoked salmon is to die for, it is on top of some hash brown. Strongly recommend it! Over all our meals and appetizers were phenomenal and well worth the price, which wasn't too bad. Excited to try there dinner menu.

Went for the first time with my friend who has a 2 month old. We knew it would be somewhat of a hassle to relax and hard on the nail tech. We both got a manicure and were blown away by the work and service at classy nails. They were patient if we had to take our hand away and feed the baby,etc.. It made it so nice for us when they were engaged with us and the baby it didn't make us feel guilty! With all that going on our nails came out perfect!

Every time I've gone it has been busy, however the wait never seemed outrageous. I've only tried the kale salad and the quinoa salad. They are both so good I don't want to get anything else lol. If you're in the mood for a quick healthy meal this is the place. The atmosphere is awesome and the lemonade is to die for. It is somewhat pricey but you leave feeling healthy and full!
