I like Lucy close a lot I have racks and racks of it in my closet and I buy a pretty regularly but what I don't like when I come in the store is it I have someone hovering over me all of the time And making comments about the sizing the pricing and the store and the product as if I know nothing about any of it It is really tiring I feel like I can never have any of my own space or quiet time when I come in there and just feel harassed and  I've actually walked out of the store because I was so tired of not being able to just look and take my time - sometimes I have purchased things because I was in a hurry to get away from your people and then I end up returning it  So please do not do that to your customers we are not children  I love your products let me purchase in peace and continue to be a loyal customer -thank you

This is an excellent restaurant - we have eaten there before and took company from California with us tonight and everyone was pleased with their meal  It is authentic food and it is delicious and the variety of choices are excellent - one of the choices I always order is the salmon because it is absolutely perfect - the side salads are terrific too as a compliment to the dinner it is a gem in downtown

Great sandwich today - had the veggie one - we love the granola - buy both kinds all the time - hubby likes the bread and I buy things as gifts too.  Thanks for being a good neighbor.

We had lunch there last Wednesday and I know from another experiences with food poisoning that it takes a couple of days before it hits you I had a miserable weekend being extremely ill and I know it is because I had lunch on Wednesday at Zipps I was sick on Friday Saturday and Sunday I'm just now beginning to recuperate  I know it was the tuna salads - the place is not the place it used to be - the food was not as good - it was not clean or felt safe to eat - we should've left when I had those feelings but we didn't I should never have not had the tuna salad in a place like that - it did not even look good It was as much my fault as anyone for having eaten the food brought to me but the truth is that is where I got food poisoning and I was extremely ill all night on Saturday night and Sunday and it started with getting ill on Friday  I paid a high price for having lunch there on Wednesday

They ruined the place - was a great place to go after a play or a movie - date night for us to have gelato and good coffee - but NOT now - you have a different crowd and pizza - it is not a gelato spot it is a pizza joint - there is no place to sit outside on these beautiful evenings like before unless you want to sit with the smokers - yuck.    How could you do this?  You had a nice and classy place before - unique to the area and you got greedy - the in crowd will leave you and the neighbors like us will not come back now that you have that big honking pizza oven - yes, it smells like a pizza joint - yikes - what a shame - we came for the last time tonight and hurried in and out with our lattes and gelatto in a half hour - could not wait to leave - AC everywhere - loud people - pizza smell and smokers too close to the door - could smell in all of the patio area - good luck to you - you have made a mistake with this one.

What happened?  The coffee prices are a lot higher with the new owners.  We had coffee and lunch while there on Wed.  We were in the area on business. The food choices are minimal - although the breakfast choices were pretty good.  The one young woman who tended the food service had no smile, no thank you and was in our opinion rude - wow - and the food service was slow.   The other young woman at the register did smile and seemed friendly but again - an attitude in the place that was not there with the other owner - we did not feel good about the experience - we go to a lot of coffee places and not franchise types as a rule - and a lot of restaurants and know good service and a welcoming feel.   Too bad - they bought a good neighborhood place and I am sure bought the whole package and now they are letting that go which is the good feel customers had from the buildup of good customer service of the previous owner. MY MY  - oh girls - take a look around -- you have a lot of competition - this is not about you - it is about the customer - it is not about saying no it is about saying yes and thank you and how did you like it and did you enjoy yourself.  Amen.

Great setting and atmosphere  Good food for a special dinner Unique menu if you are game for experimenting Thank you for using locals We were treated a dessert for our anniversary But they charged us a dollar for it anyway  Very odd And it was deep fried doughnut holes Yikes I was disappointed We were ready to order a nice dessert I have not eaten deep fried in over 30 years That was not a happy ending The coffee was good  We would go back maybe for lunch and dinner

We had wonderful food there actually delicious and I treated the friend who came up from Queen Creek we arrive a little after 6 o'clock and it was almost 7 pm before we ate and we had to be somewhere at the church across the street at 7:30 we were late we had to wait an awfully long time for a food and I had asked the waitress to check on it nobody came and told us anything about the food being so slow I thought the service was really poor and we have eaten there many times  I never had this experience in the past I love this place I have recommended this place to many many people I hope this is only a one-time experience thank you very much for the delicious meal and the consistency of the food being fresh and good

Good food at good prices A good place for us to go after church for a nice quick to light meal A good patio because our weather has been really great lately - one of the things I would like to see done differently is maybe the atmosphere be not so California beach and have a little more of a lunch restaurant breakfast restaurant feel to it The service is good and they go out of their way to take care of you in in a really casual inexpensive place but it almost is too much   I think they could get a little bit bigger clientele if they toned down the quick and easy in and out atmosphere and gave it a little bit more of a brunch feel to it  Not  sure how they can do that because they have it set up in a very casual way but there isn't much atmosphere or ambience there  It feels like a fast food place when you walk into it - you need to be ready for it and sometimes when we go out after church for breakfast I feel like I want to be in a little bit nicer place but we go there because of the food and the price is good so maybe that's all there is there  Good luck to them

This is my second time to the restaurant so I took company along - here for the morning  And it was certainly disappointing - my husband ordered hash something and when it came to the table we all gasped - did not look edible and my friend Pam ordered something else that I would not have eaten either - everything seemed deep-fried very heavy and not breakfast like at all - I was so grateful I ordered the parfait and Pam's son ordered the French toast but didn't say too much about it Nobody said they were excited about their meal - we just had a conversation and finished  And the service was slow we waited a long time for breakfast and there weren't that many people in there - we arrived at 10:30 and left at 12:30 since we were having a little bit of a reunion I'm not impressed with the place - the front door was open so hot air was coming in all of the time  The receptionist blame women for breaking the door and said they were pushing out instead of pulling out which I thought was really a rude thing to say about the customers  I was glad we moved to the back of the restaurant  The place seems to have gone downhill just in the few months since I was there the first time with my tennis group
