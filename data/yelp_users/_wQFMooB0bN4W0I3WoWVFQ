Been seeing Dr Ross for many years now and he's one of the best Doctors I've had the pleasure of visiting.

Can't give a good review... I showed up at 5:45 for a friends retirement dinner and didn't have my ID so I figured I'd just sit and have some food but the location that the party was "the coop" apparently doesn't even allow people in without ID so I had to leave the party and leave my girlfriend there to be with her family. I will never come back. Terrible customer service.
