We visited this place on Saturday night with some friends and it is easily the cleanest bowling alley I have ever been to- which is kind of a-typical of a bowling alley. The front desk guys were super helpful and aided both us and the group next to us with removing bumpers and struggling through technology. They had a good beer selection, the bartender/server was a bit grouchy and rude but otherwise it was great.  We also ordered snacks, wings, pretzels and a wrap- all were really good. We will be back.

Holy crap, the mac n cheese. My friend Syd had the Club which she gave me a bite of and it was amazing. We each had a different kind of beer, I had the blonde which I hadn't tried before. Delicious. Also- I love the atmosphere, it's open space and seating makes it so you aren't IN someone else's conversation.   We sat in the bar area at a table before we saw a movie, and the only negative was how long everything took. They were really packed and only had one server on, so it wasn't surprising but we were really hungry.

Avoid at all costs. they cut the interior cloth on my car, near the top of the door.   My mom warned me that they take forever, and are slow, which was fine, I wanted to enjoy the day, but after a half hour, and no one alerting me that my car was done, finally I saw one of the employees start to drive away so I had to chase him down to let him know I had been waiting. When I got in the car, I was in a time crunch and started zooming home. 2 blocks away something caught my eye, they had freaking CUT the interior of my car (on the frame of the car near my head, right in my line of vision. It looked like they had sliced with another key or something got caught. I was so bleeping mad, and upset, but I didn't have time to go back, and what were they going to do anyway, except offer me a refund, which would NOT make up for the damage in the car. My mom suggested I go back and have them fix it, but I wouldn't come within ten feet of their shop.   Avoid it, just avoid it.

I got a recommendation to go here from my car guy *Gary at Advanced Auto* and he couldn't have been more right. I took my car in to get a quote on having the bumper fixed post fender bender and the owner, a man named Kelly, was beyond helpful. He quoted me repair versus replace and offered to pay for my rental car upon my return to get my car fixed. I've never had such great personal service. I will definitely be bringing my car here when I'm ready to get the damage fixed.

I would highly recommend this business to anyone looking for quality and great service for an affordable price. The girls were not pushy, catered to the time frame my friend and I had allotted and we had a great time.  I took my mother back weeks later for pedicures and we were pampered by two ladies with great senses of humor.   LOVE this place.

I got contacts last year and recently got vision insurance. I was referred here through my boyfriend's family to see Dr. Carpenter. Being OCD, I arrived far too early for my Monday morning appointment, but the staff was extremely thorough, helpful and prompt. Mariah did my pre-check screenings, and I was beyond impressed with Dr. Carpenter. He didn't let me get away with 'kind of' answers or rushing through vision questions. He really got my prescription right, with astigmatisms on both eyes. He also talked me through having dry eyes with contacts, all my options, and took the time to make me feel like me seeing well actually mattered. The consultant who helped me price out contacts, Connie, gave me two options and when one was two steep, she helped me find another option, talked to the doctor then about it, and made sure I knew the hours and when I could come pick them up (since it's a 40 minute drive for me). LOVE this office.

Love it, love it, love it. had an impromptu date night, and after some hunting found out we were finally trying Kaz. The place was pretty empty aside from those at the bar and those doing a wine tasting, but we took a cozy high table near the wall.   Our server was great (Ashley maybe?), checked on whether things were available and helped with my adjusting items (taking meat off, etc). We both had a glass of Cab, shared some delicious cheese fondue and chatted while the band got set up and people filed in for the wine tasting. Then for dinner, I had the BBQ Chx pizza (sans the bacon and chicken-- I'm on a barbecue sauce kick) and he had the short rib tacos. Both were absolutely divine. The roasted Poblano peppers gave his tacos a kick that left his mouth pleasantly on fire. The barbecue sauce was tangy, sweet and just what the doctor ordered.   Overall, we had a great night and are looking forward to going again.

I really hesitate to say anything about pizza. I love pizza.   But I officially hate Joes. Last time I ordered here with my debit card, the next day my debit card number was stolen and used to buy prepaid phone cards.   I should have learned my lesson, but last week I was just craving pizza.   Now, I was checking my credit card statement, and I noticed that last week, they double charged my card once for the price of the pizza and again for the price plus what I tipped.   Unless you have cash, don't order unless you're ready for some shady stuff to occur.

I have lived here for the past 7 months and I can honestly say I absolutely hate my apartment, and property manager Alliance that has taken over. Here is a brief synopsis of my great experience so far. First off, cockroaches, everywhere all the time. No mater the time of day, or how many times they have sprayed or baited the apartment. Not to mention the cockroaches are crawling in my light fixtures attached to the ceiling.   Secondly, the "makeover" on the Cortesian has been the biggest pain in the rear. The pools, laundry rooms, and fitness centers are always closed, not to mention- When the "professional paint staff" came through they were 2 weeks off schedule, and one day when I walked out of my apartment a non-english speaking man wasn't paying attention and sprayed me and my poor dog HEAD TO TOE with brown paint. His only response was "I'm sorry." When I told the leasing office, they merely said "oh it's great you aren't mad, sorry about that." Well, guess what- I was mad. I am mad. The Cortesian is a complete dump. My carpet has come up 4 times already by merely walking on it, all of my bathroom fixtures attached to the walls have fallen off, and the new maintenance people pale in comparison to the old maintenance guy Aaron, who could and would fix anything, he even brought treats for the dog.   Paragraph three of annoyances. I have the most awful upstairs neighbors. No matter what time of night, this morning it was 3am, they had music blaring so loudly I could hear every word from my bed where I had previously been sleeping. Do they get a warning for noise? No. But the jerks can call and claim that my dog is barking, when in fact it was the dog who lives next door while my dog snoozed in his cage. Then the property manager can find time to call and let me know it's "in my file."  The last thing that kills me about this place is how overpriced it is. I pay over 820 dollars every month for a tiny one bedroom apartment. I would understand if I ever went out in old town, that there is a possible allure, however for a complete crap hole, the rent is outrageous. The ONLY plus of this complex is that utilities are cheap. I have yet to have a utilities bill over $50.   Live here at your own risk.

This is the worst apartment complex on the planet, they moved people into my apartment with me still in it. Tried to charge me over 400 in late fees, tried to put an eviction on my credit, and made me get a lawyer involved.  Do NOT sign a lease with these people. I urge you at the sake of your sanity.   I did nothing wrong, paid on time, and the leash agent Alicia is honestly the scum of the earth. Anything she tells you is a lie. I helped two people who were waking into the leasing office find another apartment as I was moving out.   Good luck to any potential renters. I would choose anywhere else.  Thank

If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I went with a large party on Friday night and sat out on the patio. We had a server, Shelby, who was hard to find and friends who left throughout the night, and paid their parts of the tab, which she was supposed to take off the bill.   At the end of the evening, I was the DD waiting for our check and to take my friends home. Our friend Tim split up the bill with cards listed and amounts divided out for her. She was to charge my card 40 (which was well over what I owed and included tip) charge another couple for their tab plus more, which included their tip, and put the rest on our friends card.   Except that Tim's sister had given her 60 in cash when she left and it hadn't been taken off the bill. We reminded her of this and she was insistent that it had been taken off-- finally she seemed to "remember" she hadn't taken it off when all of Tim's sisters food and drinks were still on the tab.   When I got my bill, I marked 0 for tip, signed it, took my copy and drove everyone home. I checked my account and saw the 40 on my card. Come Tuesday morning, imagine my surprise when 80 DOLLARS is charged to my card from Zipps. Fuming, I called the store and talked to a manager, Brady, who took my information, told me he had to call Corporate and would call me back. Still waiting on the call back.   I was even more pissed when I found my copy of the receipt with the 0 marked in my wallet and confirmed that she decided to give herself an extra tip. Now I have to dispute it with my bank because she felt like being a scumbag. Really hoping my bank will refund me my money.   THANKS ZIPPS FOR THE EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.

This restaurant is part of Houston's though it is smaller, and much more intimate. The menu is very limited, but the dishes are amazing and the service is outstanding.  Last time I visited I had the burger, which was excellently seasoned, and cooked perfectly. The visit before that I had the filet, with mashed potatoes, which was also to die for.  Each time we have arrived through the back entrance which takes you through the kitchen, the staff is so welcoming and hospitable even though we are walking through their workspace.   Amazing place for a grown-up outing or an intimate date.

We dined here for Valentine's Day and had a lovely time. The place itself has a southwestern upscale vibe. They added tables for the evening as they were booked solid, but it didn't feel overcrowded.   We had an awesome server who was able to explain offerings, and suggested a Burrata salad to start, phenomenal with some beets, a vinaigrette and mozzarella to die for.   We had a bottle of the Carpe Diem cab that was delicious. I had the Sea Bass -- I've never had Sea Bass, but it was delicious, and melted in your mouth. He had the Flank Steak with chimichurri ( a tradition for him since he was young at Rancho). My Sea Bass came with colored cauliflower that was well grilled and the lemon caper sauce was great.   We split an espresso creme brule and I had an 18 yr Glenfidditch for dessert.   Overall the meal and the service was phenomenal. The only reason it is not five stars is that I only eat fish, and I did not have very many options on the menu. Even the pastas (ravioli stuffed with short rib) and gnocchi with a lamb... also a risotto with prosciutto -- so that was the only disappointing part as I was looking forward to some pasta (they make it in house and their chef originates from Northern Italy.)   Would definitely recommend for price, service, quality, and atmosphere.

The food at Village Tavern is consistently delicious, the service is quick, and the prices are reasonable.  It's a gorgeous steakhouse, (I suggest the Flank Steak) the wine selections are varied, and you can get a great Sauvignon Blanc or a Pino at a good price.   Overall, I love this restaurant and will continue to go there until I have a bad experience, which I haven't had yet. LOVE IT.

I have been coming to Advanced through 3 personal cars, and since before I could drive with both my mother and grandfather. Once again I called Monday to Gary (a guy I have known for the 8 years I've taken my personal cars there) and he had the part I need and an appointment set for me today. They were ready to take in my car 10 minutes before my appointment, and I got to catch up with them about life, family, car loveliness.   Every time I come in, my car is in the hands of the same awesome technicians since I had my Pontiac in 2005. They have seen all my cars and problems and today got my repair and oil change done in about 40 minutes flat. Yes please!  If you are looking for a place that takes care of its customers no matter what, and someone you can call "car family," I've got ya covered. Also, if they can't do the work (bumpers) they always have personal recommendations for who can. (I got in a fender bender, and Gary suggested a great body shop down the road, that was awesome. See: other review for Auto Ranch) They have great fair prices, know you by name and by car, and will do whatever it takes to get your repairs done for you.   Thanks guys, as always. and I'm sorry that I have called you with all my car "emergencies" over the past 8 years.

Great service, and friendly staff. Was picking up the hubs suits and shirts for a trip-- Haven't had him check them to make sure there are no burns or button errors, as I don't often have things dry cleaned. They looked great to me.

My significant other and I were hungry after a symposium at The Yard last night and decided to mosey over to Mill Avenue. Loving sushi the way I do, I conned him into sushi at 11 pm. I was worried the RA servers would be irritated since it was pretty late but we were greeted by security and an adorable girl up front, seated in Gaby's section in back as it was pretty busy.   First off, this girl was great. I couldn't figure out what I wanted but decided on a Kirin Light and some appetizers, gyoza. Then of course two rolls of sushi, which my boyfriend doesn't eat (don't ask me why, he's crazy) so he ordered a Pepper Steak. Gaby was great to let us know that there would be a time difference as the steak takes longer than the sushi.  Our gyoza also came out with our sushi which was totally fine but she was great to make sure that was okay with us, keep our waters filled and humor me while I talked about my dog, we exchanged stories while she attended to other tables and she was great.   When I asked for the check she even gave us a discount card to come back for some appetizers and helped me understand what happened with the businesses moving next door (Correlones, etc) and the massive amount of people with odd church picket signs outside.  The experience totally made my night and I will be back, and asking for her section.   Thanks Gaby for making some post college kids feel welcome on Mill on a Friday night and for the great service!

Went here with my grandlittle last night, and had the best time. The atmosphere is always great, our server I didn't hear her name when she said it, but she was great. Her whole section was full with HUGE parties and she still catered to our constant need for beer and food. Between she and I, we had spinach dip, quesadilla, salad, and an ice cream cake. I didn't particularly care for the chef salad but OMG the rest of the food was to die for. Not to mention the Peach Ale is beyond amazing.   I'm already a regular here, and had forgotten how fun it is. Go there. Now.

went to delux for a date today and had the best time, the environment was great, the service quick and helpful, and as always the food was the best in town,  we ordered a burger and sweet potato fries with a flight of beers and it was the perfect meal to hold me over until dinner. Perfect place for an intimate date or a lunch meeting (seats both accommodations perfectly)

took the whole family here for grandpa's birthday, and they were SO great. The waitress made sure to get everything to us quickly. We shared the duck, orange peel beef, crab puffs and teriyaki chicken. very delicious. I also had my first ever Cosmopolitan which the owner came over and asked how it was. I will tell you, it was great.   For dessert they brought him ice cream with hot fudge and candles, and sang to him in Chinese. so cute.   A little pricey, but a great meal.

I have been here before and had a great experience, though that was years ago. That night we went with a group of friends, there were 8 of us. First, our waitress was extremely rude and dismissive. I work in the restaurant industry and where service is concerned, she definitely failed. She was impatient with us, when my friend asked for a clean plate, she investigated the plate before deeming it worthy of being replaced. I kept asking for more water, 4 times and on the 3rd time she just ignored me, physically looked around me, while getting my friends drinks. Finally, the same friend ordered water for us because she was pretending not to hear me. The food was mediocre at best, which was really disappointing. Then we ordered dessert and got a crepe with nutella and strawberries. While it was delicious, there were maybe 3 strawberries in the entire thing, which was a drag since the bites with strawberries were so good. When it came to the check, she split it by "couple" took our payments and then completely forgot about one of the couples and just brought it back with the card, not run. We were all just stunned that she had added 20% gratuity to all of our checks (Im sure is policy with larger groups) but we would not have left it for her awful service. I can't recommend this place anymore, that's for sure.

What a lovely establishment. Boyfr took me for an impromptu date night after we had both gotten over headcolds, and we were seated in the backroom near a large, fun group who had just come from the Phoenix Open. Our waiter, Chris, was extremely knowledgeable and he made our evening extremely enjoyable.   Because it was our first time, we really enjoyed that Chris explained the menu, how the entrees and appetizers worked, the sides for sharing and went over the wine menu with us. I had a sauv, boyf went for a chilean cab (the only one on the menu and I highly reccommend it (I stole a sip)  We split a ceasar, that was delicious. I had the citrus glazed salmon, he had a filet and we split some mashed potatoes. The salmon basically melted apart and was absolutely delicious, as were the potatoes. He really enjoyed his filet, and took the rest home for our pup to have.   Before rolling ourselves to the car, we got into a great conversation with Chris about the midwest, his background in Aviation (we didn't mention that Boyf is a pilot) and the dinner felt like a conversation with old friends rather than a stuffy atmosphere.  I would highly reccommend this location for a great night out, and ask for Chris.

Great evening with my grandparents. I had the NY strip, Grandma had the halibut, and Gramps had the jambalaya... We had a great time. We had a server who was training a guy named Tom, the trainee was great. The only downside was that they were not quick to refill drinks, even after my grandpa specifically asked for consistent refills because his jambalaya was so smokin' hot. Otherwise, great time, great menu, and Tom the Trainee-- you rock!   Also: There is a super tall bartender who is amazing. On the night I found out I am mildly gluten intolerant, I went in for dinner, sat at the bar with friends and he was so attentive to us and so helpful with me for ordering a gluten free meal and beer. He also took such good care of my friends and I, even though we were probably giggly and obnoxious because we were excited to shop for Vegas. Thanks again!

Finally checked this place out last night around 6. It was super busy and loud, but there were some tables open near the patio so we grabbed on there. Got an appetizer flatbrea- BBQ Chicken with jalepenos, cheddar cheese, red onions-- it was AMAZING. I even picked off some ingredients I don't like, but the taste was out of this world.  For dinner we both had 'The Hot Chick" chicken sandwich. It was absolutely amazing. It had this spicy avocado mayo, and the fries were outstanding.  Our server was this adorable girl who was super helpful, kept a good eye on our table and made sure we had everything we needed.   The only reason this is 4 not 5 stars is because I personally didn't like how loud it was. Once it cools down I will definitely be checkin out the patio.

Disclaimer: I am a super neurotic dog mom. And I have a neurotic german shepherd. So there's that.  My mom had taken my dog to get his nailed trimmed here while she watched him by her friend Judy who grooms here. I let his nails get far too long and decided that I needed to sack up and call to make an appointment.  I called and explained he had been in before, that I was nervous dog mom. The woman on the phone asked my dog's name, and then said "Oh, yes! The German Shepherd mix!" (insert sigh of relief)   The next day was the day before Christmas, and they were super busy when I arrived. They have two rooms, one for little dogs to play, and one for big dogs. Both rooms have monitors and the grooming area was full of dogs getting beautiful for the holidays. The dogs were all playing and having a ton of fun.  They led Ruckus back, and of course he starts being neurotic as one of the employees starts clipping his nails, so I see another lady start cuddling him and reassuring him (It was too sweet). He even fake yelps (anyone with a big baby dog knows what I mean *when you're making them do something they don't want to*) and out of nowhere this HUGE bulldog comes running over to the fence where they are and starts nudging him and licking him, and I just about melted. So as my overdramatic dog is acting like the world is ending because his nails are being clipped, these big dogs are coming over and checking on him while he yelps like he is dying (which, of course, he isn't). The staff were so patient and kind to him, when I know he isn't the easiest dog to deal with. They were busy, and had a full house of doggy daycare pups.  They knew each dog by name, and took the time to care. It may not seem like much but Ruckus has always been nervous with people so, not only for him to have such a social interaction but for them to be understanding of my anxiety was seriously awesome.

I really love this place. My boyfriend lives here, in a loft, but what I love is that it is always quiet. I'm not sure if they put him in the 'old fogies' wing, but for adults its a nice location, beautiful view, and a great pool. His apartment feels taken care of, and when he has a maintenance issue it can be resolved quickly. I looked here when looking for apartments, but the non-lofts just felt small for me, so his is perfect.

Obviously we all have "our" coffee places but I absolutely love these baristas. I always do the drive thru and am usually in a hurry, aren't we all? They always double check my order and are so pleasant. Thank you Starbucks for puttin up with even my worst mornin moods and always getting my complicated order correct and not rolling your eyes at me when I order it. You guys rock.

We dined here for Valentine's Day. It was great but a few things stuck out. My boyfriend had called ahead to make sure they had their regular menu too- which they did but they failed to mention it.  The maitre de also placed us next to another couple when we came in and the place was far from empty- we asked to move tables and lucky we did because it never filled up.  Otherwise, the food was amazing and our server was great. We really enjoyed the wine pairing with each course. I think we would try it again.

I have eaten here so many times and my biggest complaint has to be- SERVICE!   Yesterday topped my last few experiences which weren't that awful but, yikes.   I went with two girls from work as a going away lunch and at lunch it is "seat yourself." As they were very busy, we picked a table in the main dining room and waited. And waited, we were finally greeted by a great manager who took our drink and appetizer orders. The only time we saw our waitress was to deliver some food.  We jokingly asked if we could tip the manager, but we meant it. Then my friends lunch came, a club foccacia came/ and she bit into paper. Like a huge roll of paper that had been wrapped around the ham, and they didn't even notice.   I hailed another server who I told and she just nodded knowingly, like it happens all the time, grabbed the food, and said "I will have them remake it." What if she wanted something else? Why didn't you take it off the check? Why no apology?  She did go tell that same manager who came over and apologiZed profusely, but my friend barely touched the "remade" one which was the same dish just with the ham taken out.  I have to say I normally love Zipps but this location has never impressed me.

2 Things- We came in with an 8 top of indecisive people on New Years Eve.   It was beyond busy.   They had reservation after reservation coming in, basically everyone was a regular. Our server was overloaded, but kept us attended to- the food was phenomenal, the wine was delicious, we even had fun poppers with games in them and were joking around at the table. The ambiance was lovely. It was a place that would make you want to come back simply because the people around you were enjoying themselves.   I had the lasagna, a friend had the fettucine, boyfriend had the bolognese, dad had the veal, boyfriends dad had the piccata and everyone was satisfied. Would recommend ten fold.

great food, service and delicious coffee. I suggest the mediterranean scramble for breakfast if you're looking for something vegetarian (the feta cheese is the perfect addition to the veggies) and the iced coffee is to die for. I love all the families, the dog friendly patio and the beautiful surrounding agritopia. Can't get enough of this place!

Yuck Yuck Yuck. I went to Sumo with my best friend and her mom, and had the oddest experience. First off, the sushi was really awful. The appetizers were good, especially the garlic edamame. Now, I think the rest of our mistakes can be attributed to a large language barrier between us and our server, but we got the wrong saki, wrong drinks, just a lot of "wrong." Apparently it's under new ownership but the best part of the meal was easily the Kirin Light.

I've been coming to Cartel since 2009. They always have such great coffee, service snd the atmosphere is awesome. I got my iced Toddy and my boyf got an 'over rico' coffee. The staff was so sweet and kind, I love their expansion and can't wait to go back again.

love. love. love.  I had a stressful interview on the strip and wanted to get some lunch, so I stopped at a place I know in Town Center- CPK. I sat at the bar, and had the greatest server. He needed a shoutout.  I asked him for suggestions on the menu, he had options for me, and suggested two salads, and something that caught my eye- the Spinach & Artichoke Pizza. We discussed in length the difference between that pizza and the classic BBQ Chicken. Well, His suggestions were great, didn't try to oversell me and cracked me up the entire time I was there.   The manager was near the bar area and was extremely involved in the kitchen as well as his serving staff, which was really nice to see.   I have been there twice while in Vegas, and while I love small local business, this is a place I will frequent.

This is a great place to stop in for an intimate dinner or a bite before a movie. We went in and got a sandwich and a pizza, a glass of cab sauv and a mojito. The only confusing thing were how many people attended to our table. The pizza was just okay, but the hubs sandwich was delicious. I would go back and order some pasta, anytime. Would definitely recommend

Worst car wash I've ever been to.  Not only did this joke of a location do the crappiest job on my car I've ever had, they also managed to not clean the interior at all after I specifically asked for it to be cleaned. Didn't leather lotion the seats, or clean the windows, no air freshner after I asked or pacific breeze. The outside is still dirty, there were water puddles in my cup holders and dog hair was everywhere. Are you KIDDING me?  This place is a disgrace. Maybe if the employees stopped screwing around long enough to so their jobs I would not have wasted my entire lunch hour there.

I've been taking my dog Ruck to Dr Aric since I've had him, almost 4 years, through my dog jumping off my balcony like an idiot, having allergies, etc, and Dr. Aric has been the best both in actually caring and being thorough. I would suggest this vet to anyone that cares about their animal.

amazing servers, super attentive and sweet. You can ask anyone that works there for help and they will be there.  the potato skins were DELICIOUS, and for being on a date, the waitress was perfectly attentive. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because at about  8pm the bar became crowded with drunk, obnoxious girls who were yelling to each other from a 3 foot distance so I couldn't hear myself think, and we all know patrons can't be chosen by a bar, so that's a personal gripe.... I love the lodge when it's quiet or even with a group on the patio.   Lodge, you have always done right for me. Thank you!

As far as inexpensive, clean, well put together gyms go- Tempe 24 hour has it covered. Since college, they have renovated a bit, now they have a basketball court, as well as separate rooms for spin & group X.  I really enjoy the high vaulted ceilings, variety and plethora of machines, and the general friendliness of everyone there. I had only been on slow days, which was nice, and went at 4:30 on Monday- it was packed, but it's laid out well enough so you don't feel cramped.

Oliveo was my favorite place in college, but I have to say, it has never changed. Greek fries are heaven, and every dish delivers.   YUM

Wow, what excellent customer service and smiling faces. I really appreciate going the extra mile get my day off to a good start and the great attitudes. Also, thank you for writing 'Happy Birthday' on my co-worker's coffee- She loved it! If I could just donate part of paycheck to Dutch Bros, I think it would be safe to say, I don't think I would put my patronage towards a Starbucks again. Thank you guys for making my Wednesday great!

Had such an amazing experience here last week.   Dined here after early day from work with my best friend and my grand parents. We had appetizers, lunch (nana and I had pastas, zach and my papa had sandwiches, we had deserts (lava cake, cheesecakes, and tiramisu, wine, and coffee) and the entire meal was exceptional.  Lunch was super busy, but they always kept an eye on us and made sure we were well taken care of.   I have always had an amazing experience at Brio and love it there. Check it out for date night or for a nice family dinner.

We decided to do date night here last night; I had dined here twice in the previous 4 years but have not been in recently. We arrived around 7:30 and the place was moderately busy. It was a beautiful night and the patio was packed. The hosts put us as close the patio as possible, in a two top afixed to the patio doors, which was perfect.   Our server was just the right amount of attentive. She gave us time to look at the menu, order wine, and gave suggestions on what size pizza and pasta we should share since I remembered loving all the dishes I had tried there.  We decided on a glass of sauv blanc for me, a cab sauv for him, a yukon gold potato pizza with an egg baked on top and a small bolognese pasta. I kid you not, the food was overwhelmingly delicious. The white pizza was creamy and delicious, while the bolognese was just sweet and savory enough to be reminiscent of italy. The wine was a great choice, I will definitely look for Mt. Beautiful Sauvignon next time I am out.  A++ food, A++ service, and a great night.

I love my gym. Honestly, it's literally a hole in the wall, warehouse style. It is usually full of old people, and because it is the "Active" class, it is missing a ton of the machines I love (Hack Squat) it's really fun. It gets a bit crowded with 12 year old high schoolers who don't know how to lift - (asking me what a "skull crusher" is) and taking up all the benches to do basic curls. If you go at the right times, you can avoid that and take advantage of a more quiet gym with room to breathe.

Let's be honest. Who doesn't love Chipotle. No matter if it's a steak quesadilla, a salad bowl, or hard shell tacos- if you're in the mood for Chipotle, nothing else is satisfactory.   This location is always super busy, and the staff is 50/50 on whether or not they are on the ball, but yesterday I went in and their credit card machine was down, and they were super helpful. They gave us all our meals for free! I mean, no complaints.

Today was my first day in lulu lemon with my boyfriend picking out yoga pants for christmas. Lately I have heard nothing but rave reviews about the products so I went in. The store is very easy to navigate, the help is extremely friendly, and the clothes are phenomenal.  I am not kidding when I say I put the yoga capris on and it felt like I was wearing nothing, they are light weight, easy to move in, and durable material.   I normally would not under any circumstances pay money for clothes to sweat in, but lulu has all that is promised and more (my personal favorite was the Wunder Under)   check it out, the Biltmore is pretty awesome as well!

Stopped in the drive thru this morning on my way to walk some rescue dogs. I went through the drive thru and had the most pleasant encounter with a girl who had short hair and the spunkiest personality.  I pulled up and the first thing she says is "Hey, Nice Car!! I have one in black!" to which we started talking about hyundais and how sad I was that I had just gotten damage on my car.   I love this place, and will definitely stop in every time I'm down there.

Lovely location, and really well done customer service. Went in looking for a registry, and Diane was excellent for my non childbearing self. She helped me find exactly what I was looking for and was patient and fantastic. Ramiro helped complete my purchase and was hilarious and a great asset. I will definitely shop here for all 4 of my upcoming baby showers. Recommended for products, prices, and customer service

Hit this place up on a recommendation from a friend whom we were out in Peoria to see. This place was great. We had a sweet server named Ashley, and even though we were sitting at the sushi bar, she was awesome. The sushi chef also answered any questions we had. The sushi rolls were so different, and delicious. Mom had this cougar roll, that was wrapped in cucumber.    Overall, amazing services, great food, and if we are out there again we will definitely be going there again.

First off, I love sushi. Mostly all sushi, and I used to love this place but after my visit today- there is no way I would be back.   I came in at about 1:20, they close briefly from 2-4 everyday. There was one other couple, a server and no sushi chef anywhere. The first thing I noticed was this huge tub sitting out behind the sushi bar that had some kind of fish/meat in it. No refrigeration, nothing. Also, the refrigerated area with fish in it was a disaster, and the fish just looked nasty.   I figured it was just me so I ordered a beer and some gyoza. The gyoza came out burnt and slimy with some odd consistency I couldn't place. At that point the other couple left and it was just me sitting in there alone looking at this fish sitting out.  I had already ordered my sushi, a Las Vegas and spicy tuna roll so I waited. Finally a chef emerged and I asked what the fish was sitting out. He responded it was Salmon and then promptly put it out of sight. My sushi was disgusting. I mean WOAH gross. The spicy tuna had a weird gray color to it and tasted off. So I ate one, and decided to try the Vegas. The vegas was awful. It tasted like I was eating old hot tuna, hopefully not something that had been sitting out.   Regardless, I could only stomach the few bites I took, finished my beer and bailed.  I've been there in the past and this wasn't the case, but judging by my stomachs reaction to that food, I really won't be back.   Bleh. Super dirty and disappointing.

amazing service. I mean it, between the managers Ryan and Matt, yes they are twins, don't worry you aren't seeing double. The bartenders Angel and Cody are fantastic and I have to say I was SO impressed with the servers Alan and Desi tonight.  All day today, the restaurant donated 10% of each bill to an amazing local animal rescue that my mom and I are affiliated with, and have rescued from. But tonight, Desi was beyond accommodating. We took over a huge table, had about 10 people come and go, and she was so quick with drinks, food, and everything else that my head was spinning.   My family and I go to Tavern every weekend to hang out with our friends, drink, eat and be merry, and they take such good care of my family. Also, they have a dog friendly patio!   Thank you for taking care of us. Food Suggestions: Southwest Chicken Salad, Boneless Buffalo Wings, Zin Burger, or the Grilled Chicken Pita.

I'm going to preface this with... I don't like mexican food. But recently, after having some delicious Mexican food, I have been more easily persuaded. So after a hard workout on our way to TJ;s, we stopped off here. This place is awesome.  The food was delicious, the service was great, it was super clean (restrooms included) and did I mention- the food is delicious. When we walked out one of the servers bussing tables even yelled thank you to us, which just seems out of the ordinary for a Fast Casual location.

Called a bit before close on Memorial Day weekend and was met by a gruff girl who was extremely irritated by us ordering slices close to close. She finally agreed and when we went into the store there were over 7 people still sitting and eating, not even close to empty. She was nicer when we came in and she realized we weren't there to keep her there past close. But Jesus, do you want business or not?

I used to live right by here and come here all the time, but I actually drove out of my way to get here this time because I love this place.  First off, there is always an attendant to help you with the automatic machines before you enter the car wash, then an attendant to guide you onto the tracks and they always have the best attitudes. I have yet to encounter one who wasn't hilarious, even when it was 102 degrees out.   The best part though is the free vacuum station, and wet rags. and of course the other patrons who blast good jams while you vacuum.   Would recommend it to anyone, for a cheaper alternative to the expensive places.

Is there a ranking higher than 5 stars? My AC unit went out last night around 7pm.   At 12:43PM today, I called Air Conditioning of Arizona and crossed my fingers that they would be able to fit us in today, since we have two humans and a spoiled furchild without any AC on a 99 degree day. She promptly told me that someone could be out between 2 and 3pm. Around 2:30pm, Troy called and let me know he was on his way. He and Jose showed up and were absolutely amazing and professional from start to finish.   I have never had HVAC work done on this condo in 3 years. I had no idea where the AC unit was (or that there were not one but EIGHT units on my roof) so Jose was nice enough to come in and test the breakers to figure out which one it was (while my dog was being super tough barking at him from the corner of the room). Not to mention, my unit is NOT on my roof. its on my neighbors roof at completely different elevation. Sorry guys. Once they found it, they diagnosed it with a bad motor in about 20 minutes, gave me the cost, options and less than 30 minutes later Troy was at my door with completed work, and my house was cooling rapidly at a beautiful 80 degrees. (coming down from 90 when they got there).   The whole process was painless, smooth and in the grand scheme of things- pretty dang inexpensive compared to the horror stories you read about.   I would recommend Air Conditioning of Arizona to anyone looking for service with quick response times, professional technicians, and efficient work. I noted too, that they have 24/7 service, so next time I have a panic (or the other properties that we own have an issue- we are definitely calling them and requesting Troy).   Thank you!!

I feel a little idiotic because I have never been to the Cartel in Old Town until last night, and I had been missing out. I met a friend for a beer, and the barista- I think his name was Mikey? was amazing. He was super sweet, helpful and had amazing customer service. We stayed and played some chess, ended up being there until closing and Mikey simply came out to let us know we were welcome to stay as long as we liked, he merely had to lock the outside gate, which led to a hilarious conversation about old school tv shows including Legends of the Hidden Temple.  For being the only person in the store, he was attentive to everyone and as I mentioned, the customer service was impeccable. That's huge for a overcrowded place like Old Town Scottsdale.   Thanks for a great time! I will definitely be back again.

We have now been into this place quite a few times as it is about 100 yards from my home. My mom has turned into a Friday lunch regular and become friends with the woman I previously complained about. I am confident now that with the proper staffing, this has changed.  Two instances that have been awesome. I had to get my car's tires replaced so of course I thought, oh! I'll go to vitas for some lunch, I also had bronchitis so I was feeling like a bit of a mess. I walked in and the place was very quiet so I sat at the bar to watch the world cup. The bartender, not the same, as above, was so awesome. She made me a hot toddy for my throat, suggested lunch, and was extremely great for me being her only patron at the bar. The manger was also there and super friendly, and easy going. I walked out of there feeling relaxed and loving it.   Another instance, more recently, my boyfriend and I ventured over on a week night for some italian and wine. Our favorite bartender was working and the bar area was PACKED. She was absolutely phenomenal, getting our drinks, lasagna, refills, and making sure we were taken care of as well as the other tables. and seriously, that lasagna-- DELICIOUS!   I would definitely recommend this place, and have.

First off, I had been avoiding this place due to the small menu. Boy, was I wrong. I picked up my significant other from the airport and had the dog with us so we called ahead to make sure they were dog friendly, as advertised. They were, and when we got there the hostess lead us back out to the patio and got Ruckus water. Our server, and I cannot remember his name, was awesome. He helped us pick out drinks and food, with helpful suggestions. We got a glass of wine, Hall had a Red Bull Mule, both of which were great. Then we decided to get the sandwich of the day, a steak sandwich and a pulled pork sandwich. Both of which were DELICIOUS. the shoestring fries and garlic sauce suggested by our server was to die for. Not only did we have great service, but they were dog-friendly and the people dining there seemed to love it as much as we did. Next time we will return and sit in the oversized couches with friends. They looked so comfy. A++

I heard all about this place from a good friend who recently moved to SB and after dinner elsewhere, their bar was packed so we decided to try out 'The Little Woody." First and foremost, I love the "sign" out front that has the light up owl. We parked just as a man was walking out of a door (one of three) in front of us, he kindly showed us where to enter, cracking jokes with us the whole way. We sat at the bar at first to get a drink from the same bartender. He showed me the whole menu cocktails and otherwise. I had no idea what I would want, so on his suggestion I tried to 'Tongue n Groove."  If you want a delicious girly drink, PLEASE try this. It was amazing. Sweet, with a little tang, and simply garnished. My friend had a jack n coke, and we went to sit on the couches on the other side of the bar. The bartenders were amazing, great service, super nice, they checked on us every little bit. Eventually we moved back up to the bar, and started talking to the barback, who suggested that we really check out the back room, so we did. It was full of games, shuffleboard, foosball, skeeball.   We ended up staying for about 4 hours, and at the end of the night, my friend just HAD to have some Jeremiah Wheat Whiskey.... kill me. I hate whiskey, but it was good,   The one thing I noticed was how adequately they staffed the bar. Three bartenders were there around 8 so you always had someone keeping an eye on your drinks, and never had to do that awkward wave until someone came over. The other thing I liked was the people there. Everyone from women in their 30's to men in their 60's. It didn't feel like there was a "type" of person who went there, just everyone.  I love this place, I will definitely be back.

I have heard numerous reports that I HAD to go to Firefly while in Vegas. I hadn't made it in until my last visit.  I have to say, the service was great, the bus boys always kept our waters filled and table cleared, but holy crap- THE FOOD.  We had 6 different tapas plates. Everything from tetilla dip, meatballs, green apple & machego salad, ceviche, machego mac n cheese, and stuffed dates. Single handedly the best meal I have had in the last few months. It enabled us to try all kinds of cuisine without having to dine in different restaurants.  The other things that made it so great were the sparkling sangria (a little too much ice, made it hard to drink but it was still great) and for dessert- Banana &  Nutella on toast.  I could have taken the Nutella home to-go.   All in all, great experience. I know there are 3 locations, but I think this is easily the best one.

Love this place. Stopped in after an event at the senior dog rescue with another volunteer because Yelp brings them up on the "Bloody Mary" list. Our waiter, Fausto, looks as us dismayed because it's Saturday and they are closed Easter. They normally make Bloody Mary's on Sunday and because they will be closed, they did not get any mix. He then goes on a hunt and finds just enough mix to make one drink.   I happily order a mimosa, my friend orders her one Bloody Mary and we survey they menu while we sit on the patio. The menu looks amazing. Our server is swamped with tables, so by the time he gets back we've decided on a pizza. His suggestions are The Jess or the Con Carne. I don't eat meat so I ask if we can do the Jess without bacon. He suggests half bacon so my friend can have it on hers. Great suggestion so she can still enjoy the full combination.   We replenish with another round of drinks, mimosas, he keeps the water coming and our pizza arrives. It has baby spinach, ricotta, huge chunks of  sautéed garlic, cheese and bacon on her half. The crust is crispy through and through, no sog anywhere. It was phenomenal.   After our food, we ask Fausto if they have a dog friendly patio (of course we want to know if we can bring some of the senior dogs over with 'Adopt Me' vests on to relax while we eat and get them out and about). He says absolutely, gives us his name, his managers name, and is absolutely awesome.  Overall we had an amazing meal, a great server, and we will definitely be back and would recommend.

I really love asian food. I mean all asian food, from hole in the wall places to chains like this. This location has treated me well and the food is always great. It is super close to my new office, and on the day of my interview I actually dined there in an off hour and it was very nice. From my experience, the cashiers are exceptionally thorough, the one who calls pot stickers "POPstickers" makes me giggle every time, and they know how to move some bodies. I've had the honey chicken with both white and brown rice, as well as the POPstickers- all delish

This is a hard review for me to write. I absolutely love their juice combinations. Kale Liver Cleanse, the Orange Ginger-- amazing.  But the service is sub par. I went twice in one day (addicted) and the same girl behind the counter was super rude to my friend and I both times, and they had us wait so an employee could take a call.   Also- I know this place has a ton of fans, a lot of people I know, but I haven't found a dish that I like. I tried a salad and it was drowning in dressing, and the scrambled eggs were crusty. The second time I tried to eat there I had the steak sandwich, I ordered it without certain ingredients that came on it anyway, and the entire sandwich was lettuce.   It may just not be my style for food, but for someone who loves to eat, it has been repeatedly disappointing.

We were alerted at work today that these gentlemen were going to be in the area today and we could arrange car washes if interested.  I have a German shepherd mutt who sheds and was super excited to have someone clean my car and finally get the dog hair out of my car.  They did an excellent job on the interior of my car. They were extremely thorough, shampooed the carpets and there wasn't any dog hair to be seen - I was beyond excited!  The outside looked great with the exception of some dirt spots - definitely recommend. SO convenient that they come to you, at work, home wherever and do it while you go about your business.

My friend and I bought a groupon on Sunday morning and checked this place out for lunch that day. There at a few reasons specifically that I loved this place. The atmosphere was great, the service was phenomenal and thorough.  First, I am highly allergic to mango/ which is a frequently used ingredient in a ton of modern Mexican restaurants. I asked one server, not ours about the salsa flight, just in case. Not thinking about it when our server came back he said without missing a beat "oh and ma'am there is no mango in the salsa flight." I asked what he recommended and he provides options in every section of the menu in depth and when I chose his favorite, the chilled steak salad, he checked that there was no mango in the dressing either. He was consistent with water refills and checked on us just the right amount.  Second, he was super knowledgeable about the groupon. He let us know which foods and drinks counted and didn't act like we were any less of customers just because we had a groupon, though we wouldn't have minded paying full price/ it was worth it.  Overall it was an amazing afternoon, great food, wonderful service and we will definitely return with friends.  Well done Julian, well done!

I chose to stop here on my birthday for some drinks and dips, because honestly, who can go a full birthday without some salsa and a marg? Anyway, I just wanted to confirm that this place still has such great service and good food. Our server was attentive, knowledgable and not at all irritated that we really were just there for a drink and some snacks. Would highly recommend

Just in love. This bar is amazing, right in the middle of Downtown Vegas, super cozy and vintage looking. Now, here's the best part... the patio is gorgeous, and there is a wall, you go behind it to the smoking section and WHAM! There is a teeter totter. Just loved this place, I would suggest it to anyone.

What a great restaurant! We were looking for a fun new place to try after a late night out on the town. I yelped bottomless mimosas, as they tend to help after a late night, and found this gem - only a hop, skip and a leap from where we live. Our server was phenomenal with menu suggestions, kept our coffee hot, our drinks full. The biscuits and gravy, as well as the the avocado and salmon were beyond delicious. Definitely suggest this place to anyone looking to have brunch/lunch. We will be back   Side note: They have a dog friendly patio!

What a wonderful concept. To be fair, my significant other's family attended the location when it was a church, so it made it even cooler. When you walk in, they have the place somewhat gutted with the exception of some of the pews left as aisles.   Now, in our case, we went with a party of 10 and our server was new, so we had a few rough spots. One being, we ordered drinks that were missing, and food that didn't get put in.   However, the food was phenomenal. I had the steak tacos and I could have eaten 1394723 more. We also got drinks, We had mescal mules and they were also great. Not to mention, the manager/owner came over and had us try some $1300 tequila, told us all the history of it, etc. and there was live music that was REALLY good!  I would definitely recommend this place to smaller parties, or dates. It is worth the price and they have done a great job.

We had a boozy brunch birthday for a friend last weekend at Dierks. It obviously wasn't packed at 10am in Old Town, but it was good for what we wanted.   We did bottomless mimosas ($15 with penny refills in mason jars), and got some food. Our waitress was great, she kept our mimosas and waters full, and kept our large party tended to. We all split the monkey bread (holy delicious, gooey, cinnamon, heaven). I got the Big Ass Breakfast (sans the bacon), my boyf got the Breakfast Burger, we both loved them. The food was extremely slow for how good it was and how empty the place was. Who knows what was up with that- but overall, would definitely recommend for Brunch, or a Boozy Brunch.   They also have a great liquor menu.

My boyfriend and I rented beach cruisers on Saturday and rode over to Mill Avenue for a bar hop. He told me we just HAD to try Gringo Star because he loved it. It was dead, as expected for 2pm on a Saturday but the bartenders were great and the mozzarella sticks were delicious. This review is specifically for a few things, one- the bartender, Felicia, made us feel totally at home, and she didn't have to. We ordered food and our crown & 7's and we all cracked jokes with the people that were at the bar, waiting for the Derby to start, etc. When we told them we were leaving to cruise on, they joked that we would be back, and we didn't realize it, but we were back later. We went to Handlebar and were sorely disappointed and decided to come on back. Sure enough, we waltzed back in and were greeted with smiles and drinks, Felicia suggested we try a Crown Apple & 7 instead of our regular drinks, got me a redbull as the sun was wearing me out, and set us up to play some MarioKart. The afternoon staff was coming in, they were all friendly, and the manager, I think his name was Harley, was funny and informative to everyone who had questions about the fight. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good staff, good drinks, and a good time.   Thanks for a great Saturday!

We celebrated our anniversary at Top Golf last night. It was our first visit and it was rad. When we walked in, a girl helped us get memberships and get registered. Then the concierge took us down to our bay, explained everything and made sure we knew not to "Happy Gilmore" it. We had a server, Zach, who was FANTASTIC. He kept our beers full and our stomachs happy. We had some jerky people come to the bay next to us, two guys who were super rude to him and he was just nice as ever. He suggested great food, we had the nachos and the bf had the chorizo and egg sliders and he loved them. The only reason this isnt a 5 is because I ordered the house salad with chicken and it was awful. The lettuce was wilted, the chicken was charred black, and it wasn't so great. But I LOVED the rest of the experience.

Woooo, horribly overpriced, and iffy service. Went out with friends for drinks and food. Had the  ahi tacos (horribly overcooked, lacking any flavoring) a patron on the rocks, split guac (that was delicious) with the table. Boyf had street tacos and a patron and our bill was $100. Our server was extremely hard to find and there were all of 5 tables in the restaurant. Not to mention, they closed at 11 and at 10 they started flipping chairs over onto tables and the busser came over and asked us for our salt and pepper, drink book etc. When we cracked a joke to him about it he proceeded to go inside, talk to the other wait staff about us and point at us. You're closing down the restaurant with tables still in it. The waitstaff were loudly discussing how they had never closed before (probably new) -- just awkward. Definitely will not be returning.

In a fair disclaimer, no Pita Pit will ever out rank the Flagstaff Pita Pit. When you've spent late nights after studying, weekends when you're out on adventures and great times re-living your college youth in a downtown restaurant, I find it hard to believe you can safely compare it to another.   Regardless, this one is great and delicious. The staff is helpful with suggestions on fillers, parking is easy and the food is good. They did forget the cheese on the boy's philly cheesesteak, which is the reason for the 4/5. And the prices have gone up. But we are looking to move to the area, and will definitely go back for another try if/when we do.

We have been here twice. Once around 11pm with girlfriends for a birthday. It wasn't busy but took 30 minutes to have a server come to us, and even longer to get drinks and food. The second time we visited was before First Friday and it was dead. Our server was hard to find, and less than useful for re-ordering and getting more drinks. We probably would have ordered more but we constantly had to ask our busser to put in orders for us. We bragged about the food to our friends and were sorely disappointed in the service, especially when it was dead on a Friday night at 6:30. No thanks!

Great location for date night. This place was packed but luckily two seats at the bar opened up. The manager was gracious enough to explain how the concept worked.   We were able to try all kinds of wine and ordered a large charcuterie plate (well worth the price) and had enough left over for multiple people.   Perfect date night, pricey but worth it!

So. much. food. We love this place.  For dinner, lunch, brunch -- this place has it all. I will note, the brunch menu is limited, but they do have mimosas and if you have read my reviews, I love me some mimosas.  We love the service and the food here, great people, great mellow atmosphere. (we are clutzy people and have knocked many a thing off a high table while talking with our hands)  We've had a ton off the menu, latest was the mac n cheese, veggie burger, boyf had the meatloaf, warm pub pretzels, house chips.   The mac n cheese is HUGE, and great for left overs, and overs and overs. Also the veggie burger is amazing and made in house. The homemade chips are divine.   Great for date night and also--- TACO MONDAYS

I honestly have so much to say about this place. We've been there twice.   First, we went here before the Joe Nichols concert last month not expecting much. The service was slow, but the bartenders were friendly, the drinks were great, and the food was delish.  Then on NYE we were chasing some friends around the club district and had had QUITE enough, when I realized I left my ID back at the hotel. We jumped on a cart and on the way back saw the Goodwood when we remembered how good the food and drinks were. We walked in, cash ready, when the bouncers gave us a friendly smiled and ushered us in. The tables were covered in NYE hats, noise makers, and fun stuff. Everyone was dancing and smiling. People were running around with cowbells. It was like a scene out of a movie. I went to sit in the booth, but my bf said "no way that isn't reserved." I bet him $5 and sat down. Sure enough another couple came in and pointed to the booth across the way. The friendly bartender I recognized from our prior visit smiled and ushered the couple to the booth letting them know they could sit wherever, order food from the bar and have a great time.   We proceeded to order drinks, dance, and have an AMAZING time until the ball drop. They passed out champagne to everyone, people ran around cheersing and hugging like they had been friends for years. We ordered half the menu and ate like our lives depended on it, and left as the bar closed.   We will definitely start frequenting this place and are so grateful we found a friendly, welcoming and downright AMAZING place to ring in the new year.

Great staff. Consistent juices and lemon/ginger shots. They are always in awesome spirits and know the product. I had to get the boy a smoothie and can't have coconut so they told me their favorites and also provided alternatives. Love it. Please open even more locations so you can take more of my money. You can have it all.

I know this location has been a thousand things before it was Thirsty Lion, but can we talk about something for a second? HOW COZY IS THE LAYOUT? Does anyone else feel like they have been transported to Ireland into a tavern tucked away in a neighborhood with cobblestone streets? Or maybe its got a Hogwarts feel and I just really want to be a wizard.   Either way-- This Thirsty Lion beats all other locations. We stopped in after our movie to grab a bite because boyf told me I would not be cooking. Our server was sweet and understanding that we probably wouldn't be her most profitable table because we had just eaten our weight in popcorn, but wanted to grab a salad and a glass of wine, and enjoy the OH SO GORGEOUS weather and sit on the 'You're a wizard Harry' patio that is Thirsty Lion Fashion Square.  Reading the other reviews in the side panel, I now wish I had stopped into the "fancy British bathrooms" because I am sure it would have convinced me I had stepped into a time continuum on the escalator out of the theatre. Neither here nor there.   Anyway, 500000 stars for the build out done on the space. Salad was caesar and nothing to write home about, will return and try something to give a real rating for. 5 stars for great Sauvignon Blanc because good wine is good wine. 5 stars to the movie we saw because it was phenomenal.

We had previously been to the CB & C in Old Town and not had great experiences, but we totally excited that one opened up in walking distance from our condo. One Saturday we decided to stop in for lunch and some beers.   It was a busy afternoon with football on, and we were sat in the middle of the restaurant. Our waitress, Christy, was prompt and came over with menus and beer suggestions. We had hummus as a starter, which was really delicious. I loved the sirracha hummus with the warm pita bread and veggies. I also got a orange blossom beer which was ice cold. Boyf scarfed down the regular hummus and warm pita bread, and Christy was quick to make sure we had water filled and beers refilled.   When it came to the menu, Boyf couldn't pick because everything looked delicious and I wasn't sure about having tomatoes on my grilled cheese. Because Christy knew the menu she suggested I get them on the side so I could try them (dang I love when servers know the menu and have good suggestions) I got the grilled cheese, tomato on the side and house made chips -- HOLY DELICIOUS. Boyf got the Arizona Burger on her suggestion and literally cleaned the plate.   We had an excellent time, great service and have been wanting to go back ever since. Definitely glad we have one close and will be frequenting it for date night (and so I can stuff my face with housemade chips) Thank you Christy for excellent service!

I'd just like to give an update and another 5 stars. We went on an insane Friday night last week. The place was packed, no tables except the patio (which was where we wanted to sit). Drunken middle aged hilarity everywhere. We picked a table outside and waited. A few servers stopped by to tell us our server would be right with us, grab us water, etc.   We were finally approached by a tiny blonde named Jessie who was awesome. She was slammed with other tables and was patient with my boyfriend who couldn't pick a beer. We ordered and waited. His burger (Juicy Lucy) came out medium rare instead of well done. He took a few bites, but looked sick (loves his burgers charred). I called her over and explained what happened. She handled it like a pro, made sure he kept his chips to snack on and whisked it away to get it remade. She showed up no more than 10 minutes later with a fresh burger, an explanation of what happened in the kitchen, another apology and bought him a beer on top of it- which was not necessary.   We are so seriously impressed with not only the food and drink, but the service. Please give Jessie (sp?) our regards as she is a great server.

I recently became Pescatarian, but REALLY love Asian food. It's basically a guilty pleasure. So when we walked in and smelled the amazing Flo's smells, I almost died. Our server, a tall blonde man was great with getting us beers and waters, and made sure to help me find the right dish -- Sweet and Sour Tofu with white rice. and it was DELICIOUS. The atmosphere in the Tempe Flo's is great too. We will definitely be back :)

First off, I was born in the wrong era. I would love to go back to the Prohibition Era and be a rebel rouser and live in these speakeasy atmospheres. While The Ostrich is definitely far from authentic when it comes to the trendy hip hop blasting through the speakers and the obvious entrance, the craft cocktails were absolutely delicious and the atmosphere was phenomenal. The waitstaff was fun and knowledgeable. The menus are perfect, the bathrooms setup was epic. My Old Fashioned was divine, my friend went big, literally and tried the Big Max Tiki- it tasted like vacation in a mug. We will be back.

We finally tried the new Camelview!  We love local and were probably too excited to have the option to drink Papago Orange Blossom and Four Peaks 8th Street Ale with our snacks and excessive popcorn purchases. We were blown away by the addition of the cheese plate, artisan tray, hummus, nachos and gelato to boot! (Held off for future date nights)  I can say going in without expectations helped because we were excited about everything we saw. The recliners were much nicer than Studio Movie Grill and IPic, allowing us to recline almost fully horizontal in the very last row. For a packed movie, we had space around us and comfortable walking space in front of our seats for those seated around us.   It was such a fun experience, we can't wait to go back for another date night! (and more snacks)
