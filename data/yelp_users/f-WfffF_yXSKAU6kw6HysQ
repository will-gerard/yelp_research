I was refered to Pecan Grove by a friend and have had great experiences.   I live in central Phoenix, so changing to a vet in Tempe was a big sacrifice.  But, Dr. Holmes and his staff are awesome.  They managed the care of both of my dogs in their later years, keeping them comfortable and pain free when they needed it.  They are extremely friendly and show genuine concern for the care of your pet.  And the rates are just right.    Also just found out that they are opening a new office on 5th Ave and McDowell in central Phoenix.  Can't wait to walk my dog to the vet!  Jay

Trying to find a good, credible mechanic that won't give you the run around? Try Jake's Bethany Auto on Bethany/27th Ave.   I've been taking my vehicles to Jake's for at least 10 years and I have to say they offer the best service in town. They are a bit more expensive, but the job is done right and on-time with each visit. They always give you repair alternatives if money is tight and they never upsell you on additional services.   In fact, I trust these guys so much that I even called Bill (owner) and asked his opinion on a few vehicles before selecting one.   These guys are great. You don't want to go anywhere else.

Wow.  Talk about disappointed.  My wife and I have been loyal Molly's devotee's for years, but this weekend all that went to hell in a handbag.    When in Prescott and when Molly's is in the square selling grub, we're there to buy it.  Never fail.  This weekend my wife stood in line and ordered 5 "burritos" - not tamales.  When they rang her up, it was a bit cheaper than she expected, so she asked if the price was right for five burritos.  The old man behind the register says, "yes", and hands her a bag of grub.  The bag felt a bit light, so she again asks, "these are burrito's, right?" and he answers, "Yes, burritos".  So, the wife gets into car and we drive away.  One minute later she tells me that they've given us tamales - not burritos.  So, we drive back willing to stand in line because we simply love Mollys' food.    And here's when everything turns south. Upon addressing their "mix-up" with the old man behind the register, we are quickly told that the order was correct and they would not offer an exchange. Nor would they give us our money back.  Whatever happened to the old customer service mantra, "the customer is always right"?  Apparently the old man has never heard this before.    Needless to say, my once uber-loyal spouse was not pleased.  Hence this post.  Sorry Molly's...you just lost a few loyal customers over a few burritos.

In a sea of great Mexican restaurants, I've always found it difficult to find a great taco shop like the kind you can find in Mexico or even southern California. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places here in Phoenix...but, along came America's and man do I dig their grub and their vibe. I've ben eating here regularly (at both locations) since they have opened and have yet to have a poor experience.   The taco's are great and my wife swears by their bean burrito. Fire up a Pacifico on the patio and life is good. Very good. Best Carne Asada in town? My vote is yes.

It's been a long day at work, it's Friday night, and I want to chill. Then my wife reluctantly tells me that we're meeting friends tonight. I say, "OK... I guess. What about the kid?" No babysitter. The kids is coming along...so much for chilling out.   We end up at The Duce. Chill is written all over and we immediately fell in love with this place. After a short stop at the vintage soda fountain (and it really works), we headed to the bar and ordered a round. Then sat down in the atruim-like area and ordered the Whole Maple Roasted Chicken (they were out of brisket, which is supposed to be really good), baked beans and a salad. The kitchen is an old Airstream and the BBQ is out back. Total bill - less than 20 bucks with a tip. The chicken was killer, so were the beans (portions could be bigger). Best part - instead of giving you a number or taking your name when your order is ready they ask for a nickname. After taking longer than normal to place our order we went with "Indecisive" as our nickname. Seemed to fit at the time.   My kid was so enthusiastic about the soda fountain that we had to stop and have a malt. Apparently it was really good, because my wife and daughter finished it before I could have a taste.   The Duce has something for just about everyone - food, drinks, candy, candle, produce, vintage bikes and heck, they even had the D-backs game on next to some old school gymnasium bleachers. The Duce is an awesome place to chillout with friends and family (very kid friendly). Certainly going back for more.
