Food was delicious as can be. We had a gift certificate and got to order some really delicious stuff. The only thing I found disappointing was the banter from our server; when we come to the Melting Pot we are expecting it to be a high quality restaurant where the server is professional and takes their time explaining the menu.. When the server went through his script about how to cook the food and such, I could barely understand what he was saying.. He sounded like the guys at amusement parks who tell you to keep your hands and feet inside the ride at all times.. AND THEN, he started talking to the table next to us about the ridiculousness of Trump and politics... really?? Super unprofessional and quite distracting.. I will definitely come back to the Melting Pot over and over again, but I hope the staff tightens up their professionalism.

I liked the sandwich I ordered. The bread was stupid fresh, the veggies on the sandwich were crunchy, and the tea was brewed fresh so I left full. My only issue with this place is 1. they only accept cash, so I had to spend extra money pulling money out from the ATM, and 2. it took like, 15 minutes to get my sandwich and there were people who ordered after me who got their food first..

Beers are delicious, food is super filling and the staff is nice. The only thing I hate is when I have to wait to be seated, but that's a good problem to have and I'm patient. Go here for lunch or dinner and you won't be disappointed

The food here was pretty good, the birds are what I fell in love with. It was like sitting at a resort in a tropical paradise. I had a blast.

This place is terrible. Their hours are totally wrong online, so I ended up wasted an hour driving to the other side of town just to get to their front door and it's locked with the lights off. I would rather spend my money shopping online and paying out the ass in shipping than waste another thought on this place.

This shop is one of the best shops I've been to. Brandi was incredible and really made the experience fun and exciting. After going to David's Bridal, I was turned off of dress shopping, but Luv Bridal awoke all of my butterflies for my big day. I would recommend everyone go here

$12 for 6 pieces of sushi and miso soup? Never coming back. Service sucked, food was so so, not fun.

LOVE LOVE LOVE going here on Saturdays. Our friends DJ here often, and the drinks are always delicious and the food is to die for. Only one problem- the misters aren't on when it's hot as balls outside.. If there are 2/300 people in one location OUTSIDE and it's still 100 degrees at 11/12pm, why on earth would they put the misters on in 10 minute intervals and not constantly? I will still attend any show that I can, but I will remember to wear almost no clothes so I don't die of heat exhaustion.
