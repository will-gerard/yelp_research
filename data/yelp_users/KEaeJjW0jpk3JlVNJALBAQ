Best NY pizza spot in AZ!  Seat yourself type of restaurant where you can also order up front. Simple, quick, effective service is offered, but the pizza is what you go here for.   Been at least 50 times and it never disappoints. Typically grab a whole pie just cheese since the flavor is incredible. Pepperoni, sausage, etc. also is tasty. Salads are simple and wings are better than Native New Yorker's.   Do yourself a favor and go to Buono's more sooner than later.

This is a really great spot in Tempe. Authentic menu with lots to choose from.   We seated ourselves and servers were quick to provide chips and salsa. Coke is served from the bottle which is a nice touch.   The food was great. Ordered beef head, beef tongue and sausage and cactus soft tacos, along with a bean and cheese burrito with red enchilada sauce. The beef tongue taco was incredible and instantly became one of my favorite tacos.   I highly recommend this place for authentic Mexican food in town.   P.S. Get the beef tongue tacos!

Hate to rate a local business so low but have to keep it real. Sal's is overrated and overpriced.   Grabbed pick-up which took an hour but the place was jam packed so timing made a bit more sense once I got there. I mentioned a buy one get one special coupon with my order but they failed to apply when I paid. They did run a credit back to my card which was great, but the hassle just added to the poor experience.   The spaghetti and meatballs pie was gross and our Pepperoni pie was over cooked. Nothing special about their pizza!  I will not return as there are superior NY style pizza joints across Gilbert (Casanova Brothers, Brooklyn V's, Nicantoni's to name a few).   Who in their right mind would have suggested Guy and his 3D crew to come here?

This car wash is an absolute joke. Wanted to give them one more chance after a mediocre wash months back. Told them I wanted the standard wash and they tried to up sale. Only to then have them state a regular wash would take one hour since they're short staffed. Laughable as I wouldn't wait an hour for a hand wax let alone a wash. Everyone do yourself a favor and visit the Jackson's car wash on Market St. for a far better alternative in the area.

Chi little spot in a great Tempe location. Seated quickly and provided water immediately. Waitress came to take our drink order shortly after.   Ordered the medu vada as an app and it came with a few good sauces and had great taste and texture. Had the chicken chettinad extra spicy which had really great flavor.   Solid service and good food definitely makes this a spot that I will return to. Fellow Yelpers should for sure give this place a try.

Solid Mexican food spot located in a nice Tempe location. I've gotten orders for dine-in and take-out and have been pleased with both experiences.   Nothing stands out on the menu but I've tried the beef tacos, enchiladas, chili rellano, tostadas, green corn tamales, chimichangas and thought they were all tasty.  Consistent food spot and will continue to go there in the future.
