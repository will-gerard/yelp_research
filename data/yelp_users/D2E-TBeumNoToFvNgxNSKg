I will never go back to this place !!! Service was friendly but food was horrible. The three of us who ate there had an upset stomach !! I had heart burn all day :( the bar was dirty and disgusting (we should have known better) I really don't recommended this place :( sad sad sad the star goes to the server ONLY   Food, ambiance and presentation of the restaurant (dirty) get a BIG 0
