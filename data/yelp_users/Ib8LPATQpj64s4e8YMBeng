I've been here several times and have always enjoyed my experiences. The staff is really friendly and helpful. I like the grilled salmon with ginger sauce which comes with miso soup, salad, and rice. I think the range of items is really the neat part about Cherry Blossom. It seems impossible to come here and not find something you like. Although I haven't really tried any of their Italian dishes, I've heard they are pretty good also. Definitely worth a try if you are in the area!

Island Teriyaki is a no frills dive with less than authentic Japanese/Hawaiian food. However, my family has been coming here for the past probably fifteen years or so and I still crave it often! It has also been through several different owners in that time, but the service is always good and staff is very friendly. I always get the large Singapore (chicken curry) with salad. It is amazing curry! I love that they let you substitute brown rice for no extra fee too. My family's other favorites are the jerk chicken, fish tacos, beef, and shredded pork dishes. Recently, I noticed they have started adding new items like chow fun, orange chicken, and sweet and sour chicken. Not sure how good those are though. Don't expect anything fancy here, but it is a nice and cheap place for Asian food in Glendale.

Even after the "Del Taco Sauce Fiasco" involving an employee being filmed using expletives with customers over hot sauce packets, they still can't seem to get it together. At least the sauce anyway.   I visited today (different location) and asked for lots of packets of the Del Scorcho sauce. When I got my food and opened it an hour later there were none.   Two stars for decent fast food. Zero stars for the poor customer service.

Babbo's is a great little neighborhood Italian restaurant. I like it because it is casual and the food is consistently good. I'm a big fan of their salads: chopped, brussels sprouts, buffalo chicken...they are all amazing! Their pasta dishes are really good too. They also have great bread with rosemary and onion that they serve with all the take out orders and fresh with balsamic and olive oil for dine in customers. Everything is tasty and worth a trip!

This is a family favorite for us. Great food and great prices. I am a fan of the chicken kabob-platter (although it is A LOT of food), pita (make it a combo with hot french fries), or salad. Lots of options! Everything tastes real, healthy, and flavorful. Good West Valley spot for Greek food!

Never coming here before, I was surprised that this place is basically like a fast food Mexican restaurant. It even has a drive thru. But lots of people have told me how good it was so I tried it anyway. I ordered their street taco special which is basically like two small carne or pollo asada tacos with beans and rice for $5.50. It was a great deal and really filling for the price! There are bottomless chips for dine in customers although the chips were slightly stale because they were sitting out for people to refill themselves. They had a salsa/condiment bar and I sampled all the different kinds they offered. They were all fresh and tasty! Overall, great quick spot for Mexican food in the area. Definitely will be back soon!

Great pho! I had the number 4, pho ga (chicken) and it was really delicious. Chicken was really tender white meat and it was really cheap for the price. Also ordered the coffee which comes in a little steeper thing. The coffee was good too but a little too strong for my taste. Service was fast and food was yummy!

So good! I think you pretty much win with whatever you get at Chino. I love the Jade Red Chicken, Emerald Chicken, Jerk Chicken...the list goes on and on! The black refried beans are great too. I'm sort of a white rice fan, but I've heard the fried rice varieties are all yummy. I love that every meal comes with a snickerdoodle cookie. They are so good! The best part about Chino's is the mixture of flavors you get and the fact that they offer samples. Their ordering system can be a little complicated, but the staff is very helpful!

Just finished dinner at Haus Murphy's.  service was just alright, but the food was fantastic!  I got the classic German Bratwurst which was served with sauerkraut and German fried potatoes.  The Brat was flavorful and juicy.  Sauerkraut was sour and tangy.  Potatoes were a little greasy but delicious nonetheless.  My parents split a platter which came with a Brat, Jaeger Schnitzel, some beef patty thing, stuffed chicken medallions, and potatoes and sauerkraut.  It was a great deal for $18!  Definitely recommend!

I'm giving Pho Avina 5 stars mainly because they make what is probably one of my favorite dishes on my side of town. Their tofu curry is so good! Better than any Japanese, Thai, Hawaiian, Indian, etc. curry and I'm the biggest curry lover in the world. Now I am usually the only one in the whole restaurant who orders anything but pho, but that is because most people haven't discovered it yet. If you come to Pho Avina and have a craving for anything besides pho, do yourself a favor and get the chicken curry. It is amazing!!

The Place serves up the biggest portioned breakfasts you've ever seen! I ordered the meat and eggs with diced ham in scrambled eggs, diced potatoes, and toast. The meat and eggs were basic but good. The diced potatoes were greasy and tasted like the curly fries at Arby's! Toast was covered in butter. Probably not the greatest place to go to when you are watching your diet, but great for feeding a bunch of really hungry people! I like that they give you the option of ordering toast, biscuits and gravy, pancakes or tortillas with your entrees. Good prices for the amount of food you get and super quick service too.

Queen Creek Olive Mill is a little hidden gem out 50 miles past Phoenix. We took the Olive Oil 101 tour first. It wasn't really a tour since you sort of just stay in the one room where they make the olive oil. They give you lots of information, but it was a little dry since they aren't actually pressing the olives during this time of year. I bet it would be really cool to see during their olive oil season though!   After the tour, we ate at the eatery at the mill. I had the Manzi panini which had grilled chicken, fontina cheese, sun dried tomato and Parmesan tapenade, and basil on a rosemary focaccia bread. It was fantastic and probably not the least bit healthy! It came with a side of kettle cooked chips. I wish you could do a half panini with a half salad but they only let you do that with cold sandwiches. My parents ordered the Kalmata sandwich featured on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on the Food Network. They both enjoyed it but I wasn't really a fan. Then again, I'm not really into cold sandwiches. I just wish they offered more olive dishes because I'm such a huge olive fan and they are an olive mill after all! Overall good visit and great food.

Leo's has amazing food at such reasonable prices! You can't beat the plates here for the price and quality. I love the Lemon Pepper Chicken. It is the most flavorful and tender piece of chicken breast and the light marinade they cook it in is super tasty. All of their plates come with rice and macaroni salad. I still don't understand how restaurants can charge extra for brown rice in today's day, but that is one thing they do. Still, if you have a craving for quick, delicious, and cheap Hawaiian food, Leo's is a must!

I don't think you can really get breakfast "wrong" but there are definitely places that stand out. Butters is one of them. They have unique options (we had the salmon and cream cheese scramble and corned beef hash skillet) that you might not find elsewhere. The pancakes on the side were also great, though I'd like to come back and try some of the more unique pancake options!

Basically we only stopped here because it was across the street from Beckett's Table, where we were having dinner. I'm always up for a good doughnut. I went basic and got a raised doughnut covered in sprinkles.   I thought this was a fantastic doughnut! In general Dunkin Donuts is fine for me, but this beat every other doughnut I've tasted. Since then, I've been on a kick and have been trying many other popular Valley spots such as Lamars and Rainbow. And still nothing has come close to Bosa!

Great Food Truck Friday experience at Luncha Libre! I had the Steak and Bleu which came with a side of chips and homemade salsa. It was delicious! Definitely interested in trying other menu items...

I've been wanting to check out Vovomeena for a while, so when my mom and I found ourselves in the neighborhood, we stopped in for Sunday brunch. We both got the basic Wilcox Avenue which came with eggs, toast, potatoes, and bacon or sausage. I got the bacon and my mom had the sausage. We both agreed the potatoes were awesome. I liked the bacon and tried some of my mom's sausage. It was the real, fresh kind of sausage and cooked perfectly. The best part is they have a cute patio area they share with the other restaurants in the section. Made for a cute and relaxing dining experience! Service was good though they did run out of the Sunday special, chicken and waffles.

Being the breakfast fan that I am, this was one of my first stops after a long trip to the East Coast.  I love Matt's because of the freshness of the ingredients they use.  Everything is hot and REAL, from the eggs to the the thick cut multigrain bread and scrumptious rosemary potatoes.  The daily specials are great, but classics like the "Hog and Chick" are just as tasty.  Be sure to come early or be prepared for long waits!

After having a less than stellar experience trying out the new US Egg on Bell, my mom and I decided to try Biscuits Cafe which is also relatively new. We had high hopes for Biscuits, but were even more disappointed. We both ordered the "Keep it Simple," which allows you to pick three breakfast items from a long list. My mom got eggs, Sourdough toast, and turkey bacon. I got the eggs, red potatoes, and turkey bacon. The food came out really fast which was a plus. Everything was decent until I noticed a GIANT BLACK HAIR halfway through my eggs! I was disgusted and notified the waiter. His response was, "That's gross." He returned with a new plate of food and added a piece of wheat toast to make up for the hair I guess.   The thing is, normally I don't make a huge fuss about hairs and bugs because I know things happen, but we were just a little disappointed overall because Biscuits Cafe did look promising...

Stopped in for lunch at Otro today and was very impressed!  We started with the chips and salsa and my friend had the Elote Callejero, which is a corn on the cob dressed in mayo and cheese.  For my entree, I had the Inca Salad with added grilled chicken.  It was delicious and there were so many flavors happening in the salad.  It was very refreshing!  There was actually too much chicken for my taste probably and I would have enjoyed more of the quinoa in the salad.  My friend had the carne asada torta, which she really liked as well.  We both ended up taking half of our huge lunch portions home.  Both of agreed we would be back!

Today my mom and I had the pleasure of eating at Coconut's Fish Cafe after our hike at Brown's Mountain. We both ordered the grilled Mahi Mahi "Local Style," which means it was served over brown rice and with a side of coleslaw. You can choose between Mahi Mahi and Ono fish and your preferred cooking style. We chose the "Asian Flair" which was a light ginger wasabi mayo marinade. There were many choices though, from butter, salt and pepper to Cajun style to South of the Border. We both really enjoyed our plates. I thought the fish was perfectly grilled and flaky. I'll definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu.

Just got back from breakfast with the family at the newest location of US Egg.  Having never been before, I was not sure what to expect.  Overall, I left a little disappointed.  I ordered the egg white garden omelet which had bell peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, and cheese.  It came with a side of hash browns and an english muffin.  The portion size was amazingly huge, but the food was a bit bland...  My hash browns and omelet didn't really taste like anything.  My dad got an avocado and jack cheese omelet and my mom got the chicken and waffles.  All of us agreed that US Egg was just okay, but there are definitely better breakfast places out there!  I felt that they sort of nickel and dime you for everything.  I asked for a side of salsa (which was small) and they were going to charge $0.75 extra for it, which I didn't think was worth it.  On the plus side the service was good and our waitress was patient while I took forever to choose my dish and asked if we wanted to-go drinks.  I suppose I might try US Egg again, but I probably wouldn't order the same thing.
