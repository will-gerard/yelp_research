Postino. Oh, how you bring love to my heart with your bruschetta boards and interesting atmosphere.   Love this place! Here's some tips; everyday before 5pm the glasses of wine are $5.. You may have a tough time finding parking so make it easy on yourself and bring cash to valet. Make sure to stop by the LGO grocery store after you eat at Postino.   Now, onto the food at Postino. Pretty much the best thing you can order is the Bruschetta board because its SOOOO AWESOME!   As many other Yelpers with great taste have mentioned, a couple of the best bruchettas (although it's tough not to just order 2 boards and get them all- except the artichoke, that one should be avoided).   Highly Recommended (I don't have the exact names down, but here's the main); the salami one, the one with fig, apples and brie (****BEST*****), the roasted red pepper and mozz/basil/tomato.   The first time you go, you may just have to order 2 boards if your party is big enough, because they are all so good, except for the artichoke one- that one is NOT good.   The wait staff does a great job, and I love everything about Postino! After writing this review I need go, like this weekend... Like now, wait, "Can we go to Postino for lunch?"

Went to this place last night for a BEARDO and Dirt Nasty show. Wayyy fun! (Even though Andre Legacy didn't show).   Wow, I cannot believe what a good time I had. Really intimate venue when they performed on the first level. Moderately priced drinks and my favorite was the outdoor patio.   Clean women's restrooms, and that is certainly a godsend, even on a Wednesday night.   We got our pics taken with the artists since the outdoor patio is near their chill room, where the artists were hanging. I also thought it was cool that they split the venue so the 18+ kids could get in too... they like music, man!  Overall, really liked the style, the less is more inside style with guitars on the wall and calm colors.   As a San Diegan now living in Scottsdale, this place gets my pick:)

I LOVE Ra Sushi.   This location and VIBE is amazing. I love the waitresses and its always a great time going there. In the evenings and on weekends sometimes they have these amazing DJs making your happy hour even happier! I think their vegetable roll is really great since I don't eat fish. It has a great mix of Veg. Overall the food is WAY better than Jimmy Woo's just north on Scottsdale Rd. The atmosphere is awesome, and there is just some great ENERGY that you feel. I go ALL the time but I did have a bad experience once on Good Friday when all the cute waitresses were taking the day off, they were short handed and a gentlemen took care of us and was not attentive enough. But that is out of 15 times, and I understand there are off-nights. That still is not enought to keep me away, I will be going to RA for as long as they are open.   PS. They have bento boxes at lunch that are a great deal & super fun. Their house Pinot Gris is BOMB, hits ya' strong.

This is a solid Mexican food restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. Frank and Lupes is traditional, and a little off the beaten path of other "mexican restaurants" in the area. The food IS top notch. I have taken family members there many times and introduced them to the restaurant, everyone is always pleased. When the weather is nice, the back patio is an ideal place to sit. Their margaritas are great!

Bandera has a simple menu, and really solid food.  They do not have a happy hour, and you may want to make reservations if you plan on dining after 7pm. But overall the food is good, but don't expect a changing menu. Their focus is on a chicken they roast, and cornbread and mash potatoes. I would say the style is comfort food with culinary flare. Don't get me wrong the food is awesome. Although my boyfriend would disagree I LOVE their vegetable platter with fun, seemingly farm fresh vegetables charred to perfection. Their macaroni and cheese, appetizer of skillet cornbread and half-chicken come recommended.   Drinks are of higher price, but the atmosphere makes up for it. EXCELLENT service, definitely a highlight of the Bandera experience. This place is perfect for date night or when you're just looking for a yummy, solid dinner with fresh ingredients.

I usually have so many nice things to say, I am just one of those people, but unfortunately this is not the case for Chances Are. I went there for my moms birthday, and we brought a coupon. Yes, I know coupons are lame but if a restaurant puts a coupon out there they should expect to honor it.   The dancing was fun and I thought the singer last Saturday night was a very good one man show.  There were three of us, my mom, my boyfriend and myself. We each had three drinks, we ordered two appetizers and each had an entree. The food was nothing exceptional, and neither were the drinks or appetizers, but maybe the atmosphere could of made up for it?? (No). The bill was brought to us totaled over $210 dollars, and then they took off $50 coupon with purchase of $100+. I don't believe the price is reflected in the quality of the food or atmosphere. The ribs were not baby back, they were beef? Uh, weird??   Way overpriced for what you receive in return, and I do believe the gauged the prices in order to make extra profit from my coupon.   I won't go back.

When I read the reviews about Jennifer about one year ago I knew I had to check her out. Every where you go online you see her amazing reviews.. and it is for GOOD reason! She is exceptional and worth the wait in getting an appointment (you have to book a few weeks ahead).   Once you become a member of her "club" you get discounts on her products and her services. I try and go once per month. I never knew what dermaplaning was and it's a really great thing. You should definitely try it.  I had acne when I was younger and have some scars from it and in general have never felt the best about my skin. After seeing Jennifer about 8 times last year I have found my skin to look SO much better.  Jennifer will ask you questions about your make-up and face care and she's super realistic. When I explained I've been wearing mac for years many would probably think she would tell me to stop wearing that because it is heavier. However since we've found it doesn't irritate my skin it's A OK with her. It's those type of personalized conversations she has with you on each visit that help the process to go faster. She also sells skin care products that work so well. The facial cleanser (milk one) is amazing and I try and use my "Jennifer in a bottle" acid almost every night.   I am 27 and serious about preventing aging and I think going to Jennifer is a great way to keep that goal on track. She's also very sweet and wonderful to talk to. I leave Jennifer with better skin and a better peace of mind with whatever is going on in my life. She doesn't charge for that service but she probably should. :)  I usually get the mix of a facial, extraction, dermaplane then microderm and top it all off with a cherry.. no actually you get a chemical peel at the end. About 5 days later you'll have lost the top layer of skin and you will look absolutely fabulous darling. You look great the next day too but after you peel is when you really see it. It's a hard hitting combo that works.   She's also a great person to talk to about filler and botox although she doesn't do that herself. Her recommendation for botox is awesome although I haven't gotten it yet if I do I would only go to her. Her name is April.  Totally awesome experience and the only person I'll ever go to for my skin. She gives you results and is very affordable.

This is a pretty good Denny's location... and I have eaten at many Denny's locations. In fact my mom and I have a song called "Denny's Blues" that we sing on the way to Denny's. I have a more sophisticated pallet, but sometimes a deluxe chicken salad or Grand Slam at 1AM really hits the spot. With that said I had a delicious 1AM meal at this Denny's a few weeks ago.. and a even yummier milkshake.   Food always seems to come out really fast, which is a major plus since Denny's cooks can either be super busy or lag hardcore!   *Thumbs up*

Being from California I have days where I just want to go to the beach. My boyfriend suggested we check out Big Surf because we live so close. It was a really great time, and probably as close to feeling like I was at the beach that would have been possible that day!    The big wave pool sends a HUGE wave (bigger than I expected) every 3 - 5 minutes. There is also a boogie board session a couple times a day, which I liked. The boogie board rental was totally reasonable. We went early in the morning, just when it opened and enjoyed the big wave pool, and the tube slides.  I think we should have just bought a season pass! They were grilling up some food that looked pretty yum, but we wanted to head to a restaurant and cool off when we left. All the prices were reasonable, and it was a fun time!!!

If this was the first club I ever went to in my life... maybe then  I would write a favorable review. Unfortunately for Axis Radius this is one of many clubs I've been too and simply said... it lacks hardcore. I don't know why people honestly think this club is cool?!  The coolest thing about Axis Radius is the exterior design, and go-go dancer sitting atop a platform outside the entrance of the club, and the fact that it is two clubs in one. One side plays house music and the other plays hip hop.   Once you get into Axis Radius check out the bathrooms... they are dirty. Dirty bathrooms in VIP, dirty bathrooms on both sides of the club, upstairs, downstairs... it doesn't matter. Now, I don't go to the club to use the bathroom mind you, but still, it is a little scary to think about what the bar tidyness level is like if the bathrooms are never, ever clean.   Drinks are rather expensive. Entrance to the club is free or $5 bucks for the ladies, gentlemen, I think your paying around $10 on an average night.   I think Axis Radius is a lot of hype. The gogo dancers are pretty, but it is over crowded, muggy and the entire club feels dirty.   I'd suggest Dirty Pretty or American Junkie.

Olive and Ivy gets four stars for decor, atmosphere, location and overall food. But for me, I wouldn't say Olive and Ivy has the best food in Scottsdale for the price. I been here three times, and tried appetizers, entrees and desserts.   Let's talk about the wine menu, it is expansive with various wines avialable by the bottle or glass. Also O & I does have a specialty drink menu. I think the chopped chicken salad is better than the Meditteranean.. The bread they give you is light and served with a thick pesto sauce, and is very delicious.   The patio is great. As we get to the close of the fall, spring and winter season, heading into summer, get out on that patio asap. It is on the Scottsdale Waterfront, and they have misters and nice patio decor. Very relaxing, "upscale" feeling place.  Also, they do have a small market, with food available to go, made-to-order and wine  available. I might check that out for lunch one day. I'm always tempted to raid the market before I go home, but I haven't yet.  One thing that jades my experience evertyime I've been to O & I is the hostesses. They usually have a weird attitude, and it seems like they are doing you a favor by seating you.  Waiters/Waitresses are always great, and I love their style!   This is a great place to take family or go on a special day.

Waitress took a long time to seat us. Then didn't give us an option on table choice (we didn't want to sit in the doorway), when I asked her to move she told me "you can sit over there" in such a rude tone. We decided to leave.

To Owners, you should really consider covering the bright window so your first booth can be sat around 6!! We got the last booth avail and then saw 3 parties try to sit in the too much glare booth as they were warned by the hostess, and then upset that the only seating left was upstairs.    The happy hour was good, I tried the house margarita, tinga taco, and an al pastor taco as well. I really didn't like how small the plate with the taco was, the tacos were almost falling off of the plate. I eat a lot of tacos at different restaurants and the entire experience was messed up because the 2 tacos were falling into each other on the really small plate. I liked the tinga taco but not the Al Pastor.   Might come back for the atmosphere.

For starters, the decor is awesome. It is OLD TOWN SCOTTSDALE. Saddle Ranch, and it's "western vibe" make Old Town, feel even more "Old Town'ish."   The restaurant has a patio AND a huge interior, with plenty of seating, a bar, and a mechanical bull. It just wouldn't be the same without the mechanical bull, now would it?  But, let's cut the crap and talk about what's really important... the food and drink! In that order.   I am a big Wedge Salad person. Their wedge is official, an actual wedge of iceberg lettuce, topped with bacon, bleu cheese, tomatoes and all the fixings. It's big enough for me to call it dinner. I like to pair it with a light wine, and then get my fattening grub from the boyfriends plate (which is usually ginormous!)   Usually my bf gets the ribs, and as the side he gets the sweet potato. Now, this isn't your mamas sweet potato (unless she's Paula Dean). This is an amazing griddle served hot, with burnt marshmallows on top and you can just taste the brown sugar! Mmm..   And as you finish your dinner, full as can be, they bring out a festive bowl of cotton candy. Me and my boyfriend played with it more than ate it (I can't believe I just admitted to that), but it made the night even more fun.  The drinks are very good, wide variety, just strong enough + they have flavor. If you order a "signature drink," be ready... They are HUGE. They are enough for two to share and way too much if you have work the next day and want to be coherent.   Perfect place for a Tuesday night happy hour, dinner, or a Sunday lunch.. I would go to this place all the time (as in weekly) if I wasn't more adventurous!

Kabuki serves up edameme as a free appetizer for you to snack on. They have happy hour until 6:30p, and their food is good. I had the veggie roll (I'm not a fish person), and it was very good. The house Pinot Gris was also nice. The service was consisent, as I sat in the bar on thier couches with table.  I came alone before heading to the Gap, and relaxed playing on my phone..   They also have a sushi bar and regular dining including an outside patio. The restaurant seems very new, and clean. I will definitely go back. I did have on experience awhile back where I ordered the organic noodles (they were green); I would not recommend those unless your into their ingredients or have had them before, the flavors were VERY foriegn.

Salty Senorita has awesome atmosphere, easy location w/ tons of parking and is probably best for a happy hour and drinking spot. Their menu leaves a lot to be desired, and their restaurant appears to be infested with flies... I didn't have the best experience, but did have an OK time since the atmosphere is cool. I would go back with a big group, but I won't be back for dinner or lunch, specifically.   TIPS Great cheap happy hour $1 shots Queso dip is good Lots of parking

The menu of salads is expansive!! And on Wednesday nights they have a special on the salads for I believe around $6.50. They also have sandwiches, drinks and an outdoor patio. I was really impressed with the salad I had.. I know salads are hard to get wrong but it was a big heaping portion of greens with yummo fried chicken atop and a bonus that I happened to go on a Wednesday night for the special. (:   I know this place is popular, they stay open until about 12A every night and serve food very late. Millions of TV's, seating and a chill atmosphere.  I haven't had a drink there but am definitely thinking about it next time before I hit up Old Town Scottsdale since I live nearby.

I really enjoyed my first dinner at The Mission, the service, atmosphere and menu were all exceptional. Going to Mission was a spur of the moment dinner idea, and we made reservations just an hour prior to dining. I would suggest reservations, we had to sit outside because they were full inside, and although they had a large and amazingly quiet fan outside, it was a bit hot. We sat by a fountain though, and that kind of made up for it, definitely will be back for more patio seating here when the weather cools down.  The waiter was very attentive, I think in part because we were one of the first tables seated on the patio. By the way, I am talking about the back patio, not the entrance area patio- I think the one in the back is better.   Our app was the cheese plate, we chose the cheese similar to manchengo (I don't remember the name exactly, but the waiter related it). The cheese plate came with all kinds of goodies.   I had the kale salad for dinner, and my boyfriend the pork tacos. We also got a side of street corn, our favorite. Everything tasted great. The kale salad had tons of marcona almonds, oranges and a light dressing, the portion was large. I had a bite of the tacos and they were great, but they are small and 3 to a plate, so for bigger appetites consider getting extra tacos.   Dinner here was great, we will be back soon.  (:

We had an excellent time at the Montelucia Hotel and Resort over Spring break 2012. Their pool area was very enchanting. The old waterfall area of the La Posada that those of us remember is long gone, but it has been updated with a modern chic pool area equipped with cabanas and lounges. The main pool is larger with a nice jacuzzi. They have waiters walking around taking drink and food orders for their poolside restaurant Roc which has a small menu of burgers, tacos and specialty french fries. The drinks are a bit of expensive but well worth it for the resort atmosphere and service. The touches of the mountains in the background are definitely can't be beat, a reminder that you are in Sonoran desert paradise.

This place has a great atmosphere. I can see myself hanging out in the morning, round 11, and into the evening before heading to the clubs in Old Town. And surprisingly they have pretty good food. Get the pretzel and cheese it's always good! The nachos are another good appetizer. The woody feel inside gives you memories of adventures in Northern Arizona. For me though the taxadermy animals on the wall are kinda scary, but honestly I'm probably drinking and not even noticing them half the time.   The waiters/watiresses are good, and there's plenty of seating and room. Music is cool- a mix of new and old.   My favorite part: the bar stools that are made up of tree stumps, so every stool is a little different.

This place has a fun atmosphere, great drinks and fantastic food. I had the chicken burrito, a simple dish yet absolutely delish. We had hung out by the pool all day, and I had worked up quite an appetite! The burrito had pico de gallo, beans, yummy chicken and cheese. It was the perfect size and I finished the whole thing! (YUM!) I also had their margarita. Both of these items were on their happy hour menu- the margarita was $5 on hh and the burrito was $1 off.   I will definitely be back!

I've eaten at David's many times and the restaurant is a unique staple in old town. The restaurant has a feel of a 50s diner with great authentic American cuisine. Bonus- you can also order authentic Mexican food. There's something for everyone in this casual atmosphere. The shakes are delicious. This is not a super fancy restaurant but it's not trying to be and that's what makes it so good. I've always had a great meal here!

Better than Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles. #8 The Betty Boop which comes with a waffle and a breast of chicken is my absolute favorite. How can you go wrong?  Savory waffle, sweet syrup and even more moist chicken. Yum Yum Yum! Great service and delicious mac n' cheese... my new sinful pleasure.   I take all my favorites to this place for breakfast, what a treat, a down-home good food get down in the heart of Scottsdale

Cuinary Dropout is alice and wonderland, a purple room Beyonce would have in her house, and Elton John. Mix that in a blender.  The menu has some gastro pub favorites,  unique takes on classic dishes and then burgers, fries, appetizers, desserts, wines, beers, well drinks, fluffy purple things..   I would recommend   drinks- room service moscow mule   food-  meat/cheese. sopresatta, manchengo, marcona  the butternut squash raviolis or corn cannelloni fun  the M.A.C. Burger   (wayyyyy better than McD's makes- yes there is a middle bun present)  Many more dishes to try with their seasonal menu. Will definitely be back, especially for happy hours and after going to Fashion Square.   Walking around the Scottsdale waterfront afterwards is definitely worth checking out.  *~*~*

You would miss this place if you drive by it in a random small strip mall on the side of 16th st, but the muerte that is so beautifully decorated outside will catch you! My first trip to La Condesa was great, the music is very authentic, almost like Latino pop. But the FOOD- lets talk about it... First you get chips and you wonder, where is the salsa lady?! But then you realize that amazing salsa bar at the back of the restaurant is where you get to pick out your salsa! My favorite was the strawberry salsa it was so unique, I've never had something like that before- and it was fresh fresh fresh! Then there's other usual salsas and more fun ones, probably about 12 or 14 to choose from and lots of lemons and limes.  I had the tinga chicken tacos and they were very spicy, but I like spicy! But if you don't like spicy do not order them, they have an after burn and don't require salsa. The amount of chicken on the two taco plate was amazing for $6.99!   TIPS-  Try the strawberry salsa $2.00 Modelo Sat&Sun Happy hour M to F 3 to 6 looks great

R n R is beautiful, I just love the architectural features.. delicious before you even step inside the door! They have two floors of inside/outside seating, tons of waiters/bartenders and usually great music.Saturday/Sunday afternoons they usually have it loud!! (Which I like).    I like this place because you could bring your mom for lunch or your boyfriend for late night. They have all kinds of appetizers. I would say the flavor is mainly American with a twist. I've had the "animal fries" and they are delicious, also the nachos are good and the sliders.. Actually I have to say all the food I have tried has been good. For the portions it does seem like a medium priced place in comparison to other spots that are fancier (Herb Box and Bandera). I have sat inside, and on both floors of the outdoor patios. The decor is very nice, and overall I really like this place and plan to come back.

I liked Zinburger, but did think it was a little overpriced since the burgers don't come with fries. The food was good. I had the chicken sandwich, thought the bun was really delicious and ate the whole thing. My boyfriend tried the Sam burger with bacon and thousand island + american cheese and said it was very good. We did start with the zucchini fries even though we thought it was a rip. They were pretty good but nothing amazing, certainly for paying five or six bucks.   We were having a little bit of a Saturday Funday and so I drank a girl next door (pink and fun, really good), and my boyfriend had the margarita, which was also yummy. Both drinks were beautifully served.   Also, I want to mention that the waitresses at this restaurant were doing a really good job. I would even say, a stand-out-good-job.  I'm a big fan of FRC and so as usual, this restaurant did not disappoint.

Moving here from San Diego stunted my style because my best friend was no longer there to help me try new things at stores. So when I found Divaz I was really happy because I love to look fashionable and try new things, but naturally I'm not very good at picking out and matching stuff. This place reminds me of a spot I always went to before nights out in Pacific Beach and a lady that always picked/made me the best outfits. SOOO I have been to Divaz two times now and each time I leave with a great outfit. The staff is very helpful, and knows the stock of the store. The prices are reasonable for fashionable/trendy clothing and it doesn't seem like cheap stuff. They have bags, belts, candles, accessories and all kinds of styles from edgy to classic. Oh and they have shoes! My favorite part was that someone on the staff gave me a pair of pumps to try on my outfits with, this really gave me a better idea of what the stuff will actually look like when I wear it out. They were very nice and picked out TONS of stuff for me to try. I found an outfit I loved and purchased it for $56 bucks and I know I will get a lot of use out of it. I'll definitely be back!

We were surprised when we walked in, it was really stylish inside and had great atmosphere - loving the clear chairs! I liked that the place was both family friendly and good for couples. The happy hour was from 3 - 7 pm and features half price apps, cheap beers, and well drinks.   We split the pork gyoza (dumplings) as a starter.  I tried the veggie roll which was delicious! (if you like veggie rolls).  My boyfriends'  vegetables with chicken & udon noodles was cooked perfectly, good quality chicken!!   Overall I was surprised to find this delicious little spot in this part of town, which appears to be filled with cookie cutter corporate restaurants for the most part.

I am from San Diego, CA, the nearby border city to TJ, Mexico. With that said, I have high standards when it comes to Mexican food. In fact, one of the most irritating things about relocating from San Diego to Scottsdale was the lack of a bomb taco shop on every corner here... Super Buririto and Fiesta Burrito you are not doing it for me!!   But America's Taco Shop does not disappoint! While I usually am a chicken chic, I cannot believe their El Pastor taco.. With pineapple slices.. yes pineapple in your taco with pork, salsas and much more! Their margaritas for just $5 taste good.  And I think the hidden secret is the America's Corn (do yourself a favor and order this in addition), but here's a tip, have them cut it off the cob for you so that you don't have to worry about getting corn in your teeth or on your neighbor... Ew.   Oh man! America's Taco Shop is one of my favs!!

This is my second review of the herb box because it is SO AMAZE-FACE.   I love this place, for the decor, the waiters/waitresses and most of all the awesome food. Everything is fresh, and has a good taste, I've actually ordered many things off the menu and liked everything I have ordered. The recent "NOSH" selections are definitely worth checking out. Most recently I discovered their SATURDAY/SUNDAY BREAKFAST!!  $5 bloody's or mimosa's and reasonably priced farm-fresh feeling fare, such as the standard 2 egg breakfast. But, trust me, there's nothing standard about it, with delicious wheat toast and yummy eggs with cheese automatically on the menu. You can't go wrong with the avocado toast either. I'll definitely be back, for um.. breakfast, lunch and dinner. Thanks Herb!  TIPS-  * Try their breakfast on Sat/Sun * If eating dinner order some of the veg "NOSH" and don't be afraid to get a couple to try (the 3 pair is the best deal) * Pizza's are all very good * The meat/cheese board also yummy * Extensive wine menu

Sat at the bar this weekend and had brunch with a friend.. Again the food and service didn't disappoint!! We shared the chilliquiles and a roasted corn pizza.. The bartender, Matthew, was totally awesome, introducing us to their kale mimosa.. SO GOOD!!!   Also I had a bloody mary that had a great smokey flavor, good form. It was my first time sitting up at the bar and I will definitely do that again!  Game was on too which was cool. :)

Stopped here for a drink with my mom and we both had a bulldog, which is a margarita with a corona pouring into it, slowly. If you don't know what a bulldog is, you really need to order one asap and give it a shot.   My only problem is that they didn't automatically salt the glass for us, so I would make sure to ask for salt and the bulldog on the rocks. The decor inside was southwestern chic, and it looked like an upscale modern mexican dish type place. I might go back for dinner sometime, but I would recommend to management to make sure to ask customers if they want salt when they order the bulldog.

I've been walking past Big Earls around 2pm to appointments in the area, and it always smells SOO good. My boss, co worker and I were in the area for lunch and we stopped there on my endorsement. It was kind of a disappointment. The chicken and waffles I had seen on the happy hour menu in passing before were not available. I had the wedge salad which was pretty good, but not as good as Saddle Ranch (I believe that is the best wedge in Sc). My boss had the tender belly and it was ok, my co worker had the pork nachos (kind of fail there).   Overall the service was good, but for the decor and presence of the Big Earls BBQ sign, the food just didn't live up to it. Maybe I was expecting someting facier.

Citizens public is a really chic place, especially on a fri or sat night before going out. I love the indoor / outdoor feel created by the large doors at the front of the building. Interior decor is classic fine dining elegance with minimalist qualities. R and D is the upstairs speakeasy joint, you should definitely check that out as well, after dinner. Be sure to check with the host on getting up to R and D as that part can be tricky. When I first went to Cit pub almost a year ago I was enticed by their Moscow Mule served traditionally in a copper cup, with a garnishing of a sugar sucker. It's a very good mule. I tried the chop salad and while all my girlfriends die over it, it's not my thing. I didn't enjoy the separation of flavors and didn't overall like the ingredient mix, but I'm sort of particular so I encourage you to try that salad for yourself. It's pretty famous. I had the chicken entree which has a delicious sauce, was not dry, and had a lovely hash type bean and brussel sprout thing on the bottom of the plate. It was amazing, definitely a step up from not loving the salad last time. I paired it with their better rose available by the glass. Wonderful meal and highly recommend eating at this restaurant soon.

WOW.. I did not know this was such as PARTY.   We had planned to eat there and arrived on a Saturday at 5pm. It was PACKED, definitely did not look like dinner was going to be a pleasant experience, and PS. I was not on that level, quite yet. We ate at Majerles (it was ok, review to follow).   Afterwards we came back to Hefe for an after dinner drink. It was a good party. The bar was super busy, and I had one of those moments where I felt like the bartender wouldn't serve me because I was a lady. LOL. Don't you hate that, ladies?   Anyhow, we got our drinks, and we had a few. We watched the fight on the TVs and danced, as the music was pretty GOOD! it was packed though and you had to fight through the crowds to move around. But, still it was a really fun place with good energy and if you're trying to party.. than PARTY!

This is a fun POOL party club in Scottsdale next to everyone's favorite, American Junkie. I have never eaten here, other than a dessert that I don't remember. ;) It can also be a fun place for after dinner drinks or dance. The ambiance of relaxing and drinking next to a pool always brings about a good time. The music is LOUD and the bartenders are nice. Their bathrooms are clean and pretty.   Spanish Fly rages during the daytime summer weekends, and is a great place to hang out when you still want to enjoy the outdoors and it's blazing hot outside. I will be going back - glad to have you in Scottsdale, Spanish Fly.

We went for late night before the band NORTH came on, and the chicken fingers were really great, thick breading and tenderly cooked white meat. The waitresses were awesome, I think Jenn helped us out, she did a really good job. I will be back for both good food and music, which is something I can't say about most places, its usually one or the other. No! Not at Copper Blues, amazing food, feel good music, packed house, energy and noms for this foodie. :-D

Very exceptional Italian restaurant in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale! We unexpectedly ended up here on the evening before July 4th and had a great meal. Happy hour goes until 6:30 and is very reasonable with $5 glasses of wine, and inexpensive well drinks. The wine menu was expansive, I enjoyed a good merlot and white from Chile.  We started with the mozz bruchetta, and it was served traditionally, with pieces of mozz mixed in. This was on happy hour as well.   For dinner, we got two plates, the eggplant forte, and also the butternut squash raviolis, which was on the super happy hour portion of the menu. Both dishes were deliciously delicate and you could tell they made the ravioli dough in house. The service was also stand-out and I think the owner is the one who sat us, I respected how he was helping the waiters get tables sat and involved in his restaurant, that's probably one of the reasons why everything about the restaurant was exceptional, with attention-to-detail. We will definitely be back.

My brows look great and she's very sweet. She doesn't over pluck. She spends a good amount of time on your brows. Easy location to find and a lot of parking. Very cute room where you get your brows done.

THIS PLACE IS THE ONLY PLACE I GO! SO AWESOME!  I have been going to Pro Nails by Julie for about 4 months. I am a very loyal customer because I like to get the best mani pedi.. every time. I had an old place I went to and I just couldn't take the inconsistency anymore. A friend (thanks Whitney), recommended Pro Nails by Julie. It is so easy to get to, close to my house and not in a busy shopping center, so I can easily zip over after work.  They are open until 7:30 PM! And they will take clients up until the last minute but please remember.. they have families too. :)   Their prices are affordable and I get gel manicures and their technique means two things 1) the gel lasts and 2) my natural nail isn't ruined. I get french gel a lot and that is complicated but theirs does last well. In general, french gel doesn't last as well as color or glitter (glitter is like the roaches of nail color; it never dies).. but I like the french so I put up with that it may not last past two weeks.  Kim is one of my favorite technicians at Pro Nails by Julie. She really takes her time to give you a unique result. All the techs are great but I feel like it's a treat when Kim does my nails because it seems like she knows about all the cool trends in nails like designs, glitter and rhinestones. Definitely get rhinestones by the way. You'll thank me later. There are some up charges for these extras but they are worth it because you leave with a unique mani.   All of the techs do a fab and relaxing pedi.   The other thing that makes this place awesome for pedicures is that they put a new liner for EVERY CUSTOMER. I have never seen this done before unless you're at a super high end and super expensive salon. Here they do it and charge you the same that you'd pay for a dirty place. Pro Nails by Julie is clean, clean, clean. No toe nail fungus here (gross!)...   Go to Pro Nails by Julie and go there often. You won't be disappointed by the prices, service, quality product or awesome staff. I highly highly recommend. If you have a problem talk to Julie, she's in charge and she does a great job running this place.

Surprisingly fun and affordable mex place on Mill Ave.   My boyfriend and I wanted to eat a different mex food than usual and he thought of Fuzzy Tacos since I hadn't been there.    I had the fajita chicken and veggie taco both w/ corn tortilla. My boyfriend ordered the pork, fajita chicken and beef tacos with flour.   The pork taco was by far the best! All the tacos had a garlic sauce, melted cheese and feta cheese +fresh lettuce and tomato. I know the feta cheese is kind of unexpected in a mex place, but it actually works perfectly- also I am a fan of saving calories!! *Lame I know...   I had the margarita and my boy had the beer. Both served in a cold glass, a BIG cold glass. The margarita had a fun taste and was not too strong, which I like. PS. I asked the bartender not to make it strong, because I was driving.   Also, everything was served with a smile and the cashier and bartender checked up on us a few times. The place looked very clean.   Happy hour margaritas are $1.00 off (around $4.50) and huge!!

Definitely a four star restaurant. Amazing decor greets you upon entrance. Don't miss the espresso and margarita drinks available frozen for $6.00. They are served with Boba large straws and have some fun floaty treats, yay! :) Yes, there's still a kid inside of me that loves to discover new flavors through a straw (or wait is that the old person inside of me?Ew.)   The LUNCH was amazing! You have your sandwiches; meatball and chicken parm, and served w/ choice of fries or salad. We had the best of both worlds and it was almost too much for two to share, but still, very good flavors and fresh ingredients.   We really enjoyed our time. A Stella that was served in the appropriate glass finished off our Satuday Funday, as the frozen drinks for $6 were very good. Not to sound cheap, because their wine menu was great, and they have a full bar, seemingly a perfect place for drinks with friends or more fancy times-- but this was lunch.   I will be back, maybe just for the really great decor and frozen drinks, but the food shouldn't be missed either. Nice spot to know about in Phoenix.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!  The concept of this place is awesome, and so is the food! I think once the weather cools off it will become a regular place we stop by on nights out. First of all I thought that the two restaurants side by side and the back area with tables/chairs and decor was a cool concept. Also the prices were very reasonable, and the service was good too, seemed like a happy staff that wanted you to enjoy your time. We went on the launch of Oktoberfest and it was great... maybe because I love seeing guys dressed up in liederhosen, or maybe because the two man german band was so cool. Very traditional & they made us dance!   Here's the scoop on food + drink:   + San Tan Beers + Waffle Fries  + Beet Salad + Spicy Brat + Apple Strudel   We left happy and I got a picture next to the awesome Brat Haus van parked outside (coming soon, I'll add it to the photos).   We did eat outside even though it hadn't quite cooled off yet, but when I went inside it looked pretty awesome so we'll have to check that out next time. I'll definitely be back.

This is one of the best undiscovered restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale. Their pasta is hand made, the apps are unbelievably priced and they have tap wine. Have you ever had their tap wine? It. is. so. good.   Everything about EVO is delicious and it's definitely a place to get to know. They have a late night menu and crowd.

Really nice staff and super delicious food. Needed breakfast to go before they opened, didn't know and walked in, they took my order. Best toast and fruit! This isn't your mommas toast!! Well maybe your mommas but not mine... Wonder bread anyone? Def not! Someone tell me what they do to their raspberries because raspberries I buy never taste like that. Really appreciated the service and the coffee was freshly ground from an espresso machine. Menu looks killer. Will be back for dinner and a bottle of wine soon!!! Interior decor is clean, simple and elegant.

HELLO FOX RC!    First of all, um, The Henry rocks.   What I love about this place: When I walk in everyone is dressed up either like they spend their Sunday sitting in lounges like Mad Men or they just left church. Either way, I'm digging it. The decor is wonderful, it's a Mad Men era-esque style with a modern vibe.    Call ahead, seems like breakfast on the weekends gets busy and you need a reso.  They have a juice and coffee bar with danish and other delights available for eating in their sofa / lounge / community table area if you don't want to wait. Full menu isn't avail there though.  Service was a little slow but it was 10 AM on Sunday, and who's in a rush anyway?  My friend had the moscow mule (it comes in the correct copper mug), it looked awesome. I wasn't drinking, only having coffee, but their bloody mary cart looked cool and had infused tito's vodka selections.  I ordered the egg white turkey swiss omelet but with the whole egg, not just the white part. LOL. Also I had the fresh grapefruit juice and aforementioned coffee + cream. Very delicious. Breakfast potatoes came on the side.   Not a huge menu but definitely something for everyone. Looks like they have good sammies and salads too.   Will most definitely be back. :D

I'm not sure what the other people here are talking about. All of the clubs in this area can have these problems if you start out by being rude to the staff. If you politely ask for anything you usually get it. I think cake has the best music because it's pop edm and rap mixed together. It's a party in cake every night it's open.   Every time I have gone to cake I have been treated nicely and had a wonderful time. The bartenders are really nice and it's easy to get a drink (not a long line). The bartenders are fast too which moves things along.  Cake is kind of a show, and you have to go into it appreciating what it is.  If you prefer only decent music and a slow energy level then you should go somewhere else. If you want to have a great time and dance your booty off... Go to cake!

I'm not sure what the other reviews are talking about, I've eaten here several times since it reopened and the food is better than it was under the old label.  Their steaks are delicious and fairly priced. I've actually never had anything bad here, it's all been delicious. And that pretzel, definitely order it. Did I mention how good the steak is? Bonus- it comes with a side, so you don't have to order and pay for on a la carte like some of he other steakhouses in town.     The interior provides for a great atmosphere for relaxing with friends. I've always found the service to be really good, and the food far above average.  Definitely give pink pony a try, it's delicious, reasonably priced American food!!!   Oh and hey make their own beer and fireball-like shots; try those!

This is a clean studio with an elegant atmosphere. The owner practices good business and I recognize that as a business person myself. I would HIGHLY recommend Let's Lash to a friend or family member.

Very cool new spot in the Old Town Scottsdale area by Maya. Was surprised when this opened because there was no hoop-la on FaceBook or Instagram however it was totally packed the first two nights it was open. Awesome atmosphere! I haven't been for the food yet but according to new times they will serve breakfast and lunch, even dinner until about 11pm when it turns into a bar / club.
