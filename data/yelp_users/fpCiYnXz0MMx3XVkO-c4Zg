Sweet Jesus!  Checker pool and pump rocks.  Exactly the kind of place my  (ex) pool boy hoped I'd never find.  Good prices (free advice) and friendly, honest service.  Eat your heart out paddock, I'll see you at checkers!

sshhh...  Come on peeps.. quit writing all these great reviews and giving this place the cherished 5 stars.  I mean seriously... you're my village homies and we have to stick together.  If we don't, you and I both know, the word is gonna get out on this place.  Pretty soon we'll be waiting in line just like all the suckers at la fitness and 24hr.  Then what?  Besides $100 a month for a gym... thats just crazy talk.  Oh, and please don't mention the bar either.

4.5 stars...wtf?  puff puff give mofos... am I the only one that thinks this place totally sucks or what?  I know its lame, but I was actually excited to stop by and check this place out.  Anyways, about half way through the store, it hit me.  This shithole is nothing more then a glorified walmart.  Full of second rate food and faux-good prices.  Seriously folks, even with the shitty 'economy' this place sucks.  spend the extra 5 mins and go down the st to trader joes (shea/tatum).  better prices and way way better warez  now back to the puff puff thing...
