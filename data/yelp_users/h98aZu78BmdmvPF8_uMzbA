Like most people, I've been in and out of LAS a few times... Ok... Perhaps a few times more than most.   100% of the time, I was on United Airlines... So I'm speaking just of the United Airlines terminal....   Pros: -It is huge... and there is always a seat to wait at your gate. -There seem to be alot of food options, but I admit, I haven't tried many... but if I did, there would be alot of choices that seem decent. -It is clean. -Free WiFi -Easy to get around, get your luggage, find a cab etc.  Cons: -It is huge (a pro and a con) .   Because it is so big, it does it really isn't easy in and out.   There is significant distance from the luggage counter to the gates... and it requires a tram ride... and alot of walking.   Just be sure to plan ahead. -Also on the "too big" theme, the rental car facility is equally as big... and requires a shuttle ride... and takes a long time to both rent and drop off...  In short, it is a decent airport.. just not that easy to get in and out of... Plan ahead and give yourself alot of time!

I was in Vegas for two days and got some horrible news.  My favorite restaurant, Rosemary's, had closed that day and I was looking for some decent food.  As good as Lawry's is, it is a DISTANT second choice... but.. they are in business ... so it is an easy choice.  I was lucky enough to try the Lawry's in Singapore once a few years ago and I remember it was decent.... This didn't disappoint.  On par with the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco, they offered all the same menu items and side dishes.  I did find their cuts to be a bit inconsistent... Two in our group ordered the "Lawry's cut" and I ordered the "Jim Brady" cut  (one size larger)... and It didn't look all that different than the Lawry's cut.... So less one star!  Service was great... what you would expect from a high end prime rib house.

Sad News....   Looking forward to my second visit here since May of 2010....  I called today for reservations and was told they closed for good.  Very sad... awesome place!

One of the highlights on a recent trip to Vegas.  Word of advice, spend the extra money and get the lower level seating.... We were near the back and some of the tricks were hard to follow from such a distance.  When you think of Vegas shows, you should think Penn and Teller... A great evening!

I caught a game here last month.  Pro's: -All the seats face home plate.... No awkward seats where you face forward but have to look slightly to your left or right... This park is set up nicely.  -The seats are appropriately sized.  I'm a big guy and was comfortable sitting in these armed seats  -Lots of shade... Depending on where you sit and the time of day... but most of the seats in this park are in the shade so the Arizona sun won't fry you.  -Very clean  Con's: -It will be difficult to find something healthy to eat here. Hotdogs, hamburgers, pizza... fried this and that are your only choices.  Other than that, this is a very nice park.. It is brand new and is a great place to check out a game.

I really wanted to like this place.... But...   I flew into town to surprise my father for father's day weekend.   On Saturday night I asked the family where they would like to go for Father's day brunch and they recommended Betty's Nosh.    A quick check of Yelp showed some average reviews, but the parents had gone there and liked it... so how bad could it be right??  So I booked a reservation online for 10:30am.   When we arrived, the hostess told me that "I was set to be sat outside... Is that ok?"   Since it is Glendale in June and the temp was well over 100, we asked to be sat inside... Note the reservation never gave an indoor or outdoor option.   So they said they would "move some things around" but we had to sit at the "high top" tables.    I was fine with it, but my mom has a bad back/leg thing happening and she eventually agreed.  As we walked to our table, I noted a sign on the door to the outdoor patio that said "outdoor patio closed due to heat".   I thought this to be odd as they were just going to sit us out there....   So we order our food.... and for brunch, several of us ordered coffee.   We were told that all their creamer had "gone bad" and they gave us two small containers of skim milk.... Didn't really do much to their dark coffee.... But really?  You can't send someone to the store to buy cream for your Father's Day Brunch service?  In the front of the place, they have a pastry display with a latte machine.   My wife ordered a latte and we were first told essentially that nobody working knew how to work the machine.... they later changed their story to the lack of a creamer.... Again, Father's Day Brunch, they know they are out of cream yet it is beyond them to send someone to the store to buy some....  Service was SLOW.   We saw 6 or 7 employees.... all appeared to be doing something, but I only saw two actually waiting on tables.  Then the food comes.....  My mother's omelet had the wrong ingredients, she sends it back.   At the same time she noted it was "al carte" and ordered some has browns with her new omelet.  My father's omelet was wrong, but he ate it.  My omelet was ordered with jalapeno peppers, I didn't notice any... I still ate my omelet.   I noted (see photo) it was SWIMMING in oil.... Not just a little oil, like enough oil to over my entire plate with a 1/4 inch of oil... It was really disgusting.  My wife ordered Eggs Benedict.  It was basically just thrown on a plate... No garnish, no effort to make it look nice and the "homemade" English muffin wasn't toasted...a basic thing on eggs Benedict.... She eats it... doesn't send it back.  My mom's second omelet comes.... and guess what?.... wrong again... We send it back again.... but by this time we have all been done eating for quite a while... My mom ends up eating a small bowl of fruit.  As they are cleaning up our plates, the side of hash browns my mom ordered arrived, she sent it back as we were leaving....   The blueberry muffin I ordered within the first few minutes of sitting down arrived.... perhaps 40 minutes later... when we were all done eating..  Now here to their credit they did some things right:  They recognized that they had messed up my mom's meal... and they sent over the "owner's assistant" ... who apologized about getting the omelets wrong....  They ended up not charging us for the two omelets my mom never ate... and took a bloody Mary off the bill.   They also gave my mom a gift card for $25.00  BUT essentially they didn't do any dish right.... ingredients were missing, muffins not toasted, meals floating in oil.... They couldn't even make a latte or provide cream with coffee for a Sunday Brunch.  They missed on EVERY level.  When I mentioned this to the "Owner's Assistant" she seemed surprised we weren't happy with the food that did come.   I even told her about the excessive oil and she told me they had an "experienced omelet chef".  I will come back as it appears they do care... I'm really hoping I caught them on a bad day.... Perhaps breakfast just isn't their thing?
