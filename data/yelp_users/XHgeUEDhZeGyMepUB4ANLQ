One of the lousiest lunches I've had in a long time.   Caprese sandwich and breaded mushrooms with (curdled) ranch.  Sandwich seemed to come with strange rectangular processed mozzerela, and, aside from the strong purple onions, it was practically flavorless.  The breaded mushrooms were the skinniest shape and weirdest texture...seemed like I was biting into really dry fried cornmeal or something, there was no plump mushroom texture at all! Or taste! Were they real mushrooms? I don't know, I threw them out after one bite. The ranch dressing was curdled anyway (!!!), so they were beyond salvage.  Girl who took my order on the phone was (as others have mentioned) mumbly and careless, didn't even ask my name before ending the call. Chef/cashier was hard to talk to also, once he eventually came out, 5 minutes after I (one of two customers) arrived.  Weeeeeeeeeird place...baaaaaaaaaad food...

I don't like spending money a lot of money on haircuts, but I'm not one to go to Great Clips either.  I look for style and value, and I found it here.  Nate gave me a great short cut that I can style messy and piece-y and fun (my favorite look).  Only $35!  The place is trendy, which to me can be offputting, but the vibe was fun and cool (think Alice in Wonderland on MTV)... When I was waiting in the front, I saw many people walk by with VERY progressive hairstyles (like maybe the left side of someone's head would be shaved, and the rest was purple...), so I wasn't sure what to expect, but the haircut I got was not outrageous; it was perfect.  I'll definitely be returning :-)

Well... I guess it pays to not make a judgment until you've given something a couple tries... Got my second haircut here, and it was veeery uneven.  It was so uneven that the next day, people at my work asked me "What happened...?"  Lol There are worse things in life than getting a bad haircut, and everybody makes mistakes, but I don't like to take chances on my hair (I'm not vain, but growing out a really bad haircut can be painful).  I won't be returning.

This restaurant makes one of my favorite meals of all time; their tomato, mozzarella and basil sandwich.  Each and every time I bite into one, I can't help but close my eyes and get lost in the joy.  Everything about it is perfection, from the freshest warm ciabatta to the generous drizzle of balsamic that balances every last bite.  I've been going there for years now and there's never once been a single variance; it just always blows my mind.  Might not sound substantial either but it will really fill you up without weighing you down.  (Because AToEu is kind of far from where I live, I've tried to get my fix of this sandwich at other closer restaurants such as Pane Bianco, but no other place comes close!)  Whenever I can break away from ordering the sandwich, I also really love the hearty, home-cooked Polish platter, which includes homemade pierogies (not frozen) and homemade kielbasa (tender and flavorful), in addition to hunters stew and stuffed cabbage... all wonderful, warm, and comforting.  Also wonderful and warm is the family who owns this restaurant.  They're a special family, and they make me feel like family whenever I go there.  If I lived closer, I'd be there every week.

I didn't see any review that mentioned this, but sometime in 2008 (I believe), the store was sold to new owners.  The previous owners had a new endeavor to pursue and opened up the store Stupid Cupid right in the same plaza - it's a very cool home decor/accessory store, with great owners.  However, Smelly Dog has been on the decline ever since this transition.  The only reason I continued going there is because they carried my dog's favorite treat.  They just stopped carrying it.  I've never had them wash my dog, but I can say that the service is just not what it used to be at all.  I'm so sad that things changed, because I used to love coming here.

They serve gluten-free pita here!  No review has mentioned that yet, but to anyone who loves hummus/other-dippable-Middle-Eastern-dishes but can't eat gluten, it's pretty big news and really sets them apart :)  Gluten-free, pillow-y soft pita bread.  I have a bite of it in my mouth as I type.  (They sell it by the dozen to take home, or you can order it with your meal.)

Every time I eat their burgers I am reminded how salty they are!  I love the other ingredients, buns are fresh, lettuce is crisp, mushrooms are magical, sauce is mmm... but the MEAT is SALTIER than...chocolate salty balls I guess.  It's salty, to the bone.  Enough to make me never go back.  But... it's cheap, it's a good location, and the breaded mushrooms... well I love breaded mushrooms, and these are pretty decent.  So... *sigh* I'll probably go back, God help me.

I hate to say it, but this is some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Edible?  Sure.  Mexican?  Not a chance.  My hopes were high; with a name like "Two Hippies," I thought it would be a funky little place that served addictive street tacos... (I've never actually had *authentic* street tacos, but I KNOW they're not supposed to taste like THAT.)    My friend tried the three taco combo; one carne asada, one green chili, and one fish taco - all on the low end of mediocre (though she couldn't even stomach the fish taco).  My burrito tasted like they wrapped bland beans, rice-a-roni, boiled chicken breast, and one ton of chopped onions inside a Mission tortilla.  Don't get me started on the chips and salsa either... Mission and Pace for sure...  The horrible part about all this is that the service was REALLY wonderful!  I think it was one of the owners who served me, and it was probably one of the most pleasant experiences I've ever had service-wise.  She had a distinct Midwestern charm; unfortunately, that's also what the "Mexican" food at Two Hippies suffers (severely) from.    VERDICT: Go to Rosita's or Juan's instead...  (In response to Bryan L's callout:  1)  Yes, I'd take Bertos [or ROSITAS, or JUANS, or Chipotle] anyday over Two Hippies Beach House, and I'm not afraid to say it.  And 2) Everybody [staff and kitchen] speaks English at Two Hippies because they're white as ghosts.  It's like eating at a Chinese restaurant owned and run by Wisconsins.  When English is NOT the primary language of an ethnic restaurateur, to me that's a wonderful sign.)

I'm not a steak fan, and that's all they serve here, but darn it if I don't love these tacos.  There's rarely a night that I'm not in the mood to have them for dinner.  Here's the rest of my two cents:  -THE BEST salsa I've ever had at a restaurant.  That's just my opinion, but it tastes like homemade... it's fresh and chunky and the perfect amount of cilantro... there's enough kick, but the flavor is just delicious.  -The corn!  What they do to that corn is amazing, it's a flavor combination I've never experienced before and I love it, you have to taste it to understand though, I can't describe it. (the corn itself can be hit-or-miss... sometimes it's a little hard).    -Every time I go, I feel like I've been transported to the movie "Honey, I Shrunk the Limes".  Is it possible that they get smaller with each visit??    -And yes, it is pricey.  I didn't notice it at first, because it's so good and I didn't spend that much money, but for what you get? (case in point: LIMES [see above])  Chips and salsa are $1.50, which is fine with me, but they upsold me to guacamole (I'm not a hard sell, or quick at math), and after I paid I realized that ordering the guacamole added $5 to the bill!!!!  Things like that add up...  Great place though, and the atmosphere is cool and relaxing, with a Mexico beachy vibe... I do recommend it highly, but bring your own citrus.

Just stopped eating meat, and not because I don't like the taste... believe me, I miss this carne asada a lot... but it gave me a reason to try the bean and cheese burrito - DELICIOUS!  And it says there's no lard it in... I didn't know what to expect (I thought the lard was what gave the beans that buttery good flavor), but WOW - best bean and cheese burrito I've ever tasted!  Slightly different flavor, but it's wooonderful.    That burrito, with the salsa that comes when you order chips, and a mexican bottled coke... preeetty much as good as it gets.

I was really excited to try this place.  Have been wanting to change my diet for a long time (from your typical diet of processed and often greasy foods [see my top restaurant reviews] to something actually nutritious and natural) but it is an overwhelming undertaking.  Thought this restaurant would be an encouraging step in that direction.  But no... This place was SO bad that, for the first time in my ENTIRE life, I dined and dashed, because I couldn't even stomach the thought of giving money to these people.    The whole vibe of this place (and staff) screamed "trendy" so loud that I couldn't hear a trace of any positive message (about life or nature maybe, or food).  If I want to create more balance in my life by incorporating more natural habits (i.e. diet), why would I want to go somewhere that was so blatantly superficial and shallow?    ON TOP OF THAT, the food I had here was the most disappointing excuse for a meal that I've ever put in my mouth.  No flavor at all (does it matter what I or my partner ordered?  It was too bland to remember).  Now I'm new at this and not an expert, but I know that eating healthy doesn't mean you can't have flavor.  Garlic?  Onions?  Herbs?  Flavor and character *can* be found in mother nature's kitchen.  Just not at True Food Kitchen.  This restaurant is more like a true disgrace.

I've been here twice and I love this place.  Very reasonably priced (I get a haircut for $35).  Fun, colorful, stylish environment.  Down-to-earth, talented staff.  Rick (the owner) is wonderful; puts you right at ease, is a lot of fun to talk to, and really cares about giving you a cut you'll like.   Think I've finally found *my* salon.

Excited for a new Vietnamese restaurant; there aren't many in this area.  Maxim is my favorite restaurant based on quality of food, but the service has become very unfriendly (to the point that I feel uncomfortable even picking up my food there).  Rice Paper down the street from me is good, but a little pricey and trendy for an ethnic restaurant (and the "mix-ins" they provide with the pho are VERY MUCH lacking [no cilantro!]).  At Pho House, I ordered takeout of beef pho (I ordered it with no beef, just noodles and broth... my vegetarian compromise) and the shrimp spring rolls.  The broth had a much stronger beef flavor than the balance I'm used to at Maxim.  Tasted a little overpowering to me, but I still enjoyed a good bowl of pho.  They didn't skimp on the mix-ins :) And the noodles were separated from broth, but soft, not requiring any further boiling at home.  Shrimp rolls tasted great, but I did not realize they came with pork inside also (menu didn't specify).  Wonderful, friendly service.  Looking forward to trying more of their food.
