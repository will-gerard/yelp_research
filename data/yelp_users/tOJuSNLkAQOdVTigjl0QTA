We have just finished a dinner at the Citizen Public House and were still not just feeling like going home yet. Maybe grabbing another drink and a little bite to eat before we go home. It was after 9pm Saturday night. We naturally strolled around Marcellino's on our way back to garage and I said: "What about trying this before we go?!" Told the hostess we are looking for a drink and maybe a little bite to eat and we would not mind sitting at the bar. She told us nothing is available for another 45 mins, and she asked if we are going to eat food...?! We said we have already finished our dinner but would not mind to taste a bit of their cuisine and inquired about sitting on a patio or at the bar. There were 3 or more 2-place seats at the bar while we were not offered either one of these. With quite a sarcastic voice she told us: WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY. We have decided to follow her suggestion and left the restaurant -  which made us happy.

This is simply my favorite restaurant  for brunch/lunch/dinner in town. As a small business owner the fact I I appreciate the most is the CONSISTENCY -  or great food and great service. There is no bad days here. If you see a person there ordering chicken nachitos over and over and over.... that's me :) Congratulations to management on tightly run ship!

I got  to know Michele as she was doing my make-up and styling for shooting of my Yoga DVD (currently #1 flow DVD on Amazon - Yay!) AND SHE DID INCREDIBLE JOB! She made me look like an angel - perfect light make up - so I was looking natural but spectacular....and I am super picky regarding my looks especially for yoga shoots - where you can over do so easily ;-O  Now I am frequent flyer at her studio coming for an organic spray tan! Being "scandinavian type" and trying to stay away from the direct sun - I became addicted to this.   As I am in service industry myself, I truly appreciate how professional and experienced she is. The results are perfect = so natural. Believe me - I know what I am talking about - I have turned out orange few times already - NEVER with Michele.  Have you seen her pricing? No comments necessary - it is a steal!

This has not been my favorite restaurant and ambiance I would immediately connect with - but for some reason I felt like I should keep returning, giving in another chance (maybe the salmon appetizer has something to do with is). I guess closeness to Blue Hound (one of my favorites) made it a natural second stop with pleasant walk through the City Scape. Last time we came for later dinner Saturday 9pm - we were seated ordered food (that was not very good except oysters - surprisingly wonderful). After 15 mins of our plates being laid down on the table THE LIGHTS CAME UP - to announce that it is time for us to go. This has not happen to me for 10 years - I was feeling like teenager who should be spanked and feel guilty for drinking on Saturday night at quarter to 10pm!

Me and husband have fallen in love with the bar right away -  classical and new/innovative hand muddled cocktails & FUN ambiance was a recipe for perfect Friday evening. Slowly venturing into food menu - not as impressive as the cocktails ... up to few months ago - seem like the menu has significantly changed. Although originally we were planning only on drinks and couple of appetizers, we were so impressed with the food that we continued ordering more and more of the new menu - as we had a full dinner there at the bar. All the flatbreads were wonderful - my husband's lamb was a bomb - and they even wrapped the bones to take home for our dogs ;-O Also the pedestrian area that allows you to walk right in (very unique in PHX) makes it perfect spot to enjoy urban life - coming from Prague - this makes me feel closer to home.
