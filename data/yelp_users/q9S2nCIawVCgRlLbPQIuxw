I love this place! We come here so much its like Norm walking into Cheers. They have great Sushi and the food is awesome. If you haven't been here you got to try it once. If you try it you will fall in love with how friendly they are here. Come see how good it is!

This is a great place to have a personal mail box and for all my business shipping needs. Less lines then the post office with a touch of small business personality.

I was always not willing to try new foods and then my wife talked me into trying indian food. Guru Palace is the best in the east valley that we have eaten at. Great service and great food.

These guys are always helpful and can fix mostly anything that needs to be done. This store is pretty busy most of the time but the wait time usually is quick.

I don't know what happened to this store but they are not customer service driven anymore at all. Plus 95% of the good people are gone. Go to Lindsey and main they are better to deal with and they can take care of commercial accounts also.
