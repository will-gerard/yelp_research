Best lunch specials during the week. Great service. You will get chips and salsa before your meal and the plate is a decent portion. I highly recommend having lunch here if you have only a few dollars.  I like this place because the atmosphere takes you out of your work zone.  I did see that they have huge margaritas.  They look good.  Didnt try one because I was on my work lunch hour.

Had the crusted salmon with mash potato and asparagus lunch.  All can say is mmm mmm good. This is my first time at a cheesecake factory and wont be my last. Having good company and a good appetite makes a perfect lunch.  The choices on the menu makes it so very hard to decide.  I also have a couple of friends that tell me you can not go wrong with anything on this menu. I would love to come back again maybe on a special occasion because it is special occasion kind of money you will spend. You do get complimentary bread and that is a plus because its not bad at all. I like the wheat one it seemed to be softer than the white.  I did not get the cheesecake maybe next visit.

I do recommend this place. The food was really good and the staff was friendly. I would go again. I like the atmosphere and it was clean. I had the enchilada plate and a taco. We left full and satisfied.

I love to go to resale stores thrift stores yard sales and all places where  I can find deals  and treasures. This is a cute store the staff is cool but the prices on used stuff here are outrageous. I seen a few used items that could be found at kohls and and Ross. These things were used but sold at full price. Wth! Don't get me wrong there are really good quality items here. I just will not go back. Lol I seen girls going crazy over used thong bikinis. Just saying.

Faaaaaaancy lol. I really like this frys. It has a bar!  I wish there was something like this on my side of town. That will probably never happen. I am happy with marketplace. I bet I missed a lot more things here since I was in shock and awe. Well I really enjoyed the experience. If I am out this way again yes I will VIP it all over this store. With a buzz.

I can tell you this I will not be a regular here. Sorry Big Apple but me no likee. You get good size portions but quality and taste is a big part of it too. chicken strips overcooked with a hard crust. .Whatever the heck the corn mush was tasted bad.  They are testing out a dark loaf of bread was supposed to be served with meal we got that toward the end. No bueno no flavor to it. I ordered a steak it was nasty dry and small. I was like this aint no rib eye. There was no steak sauce. Oh and the smoked chicken was so overcooked it was very dry I think it was old ugh. Well at least we had a nice time with the family. Thats all that matters.

Everyone that walks in that door should work here. If you need help just wait for that little bell to jingle when someone walks in because that's who is going to help you. The have the workers disappearing to the back of the store. Maybe a secret salon back there who knows.. they pretend to be stocking when the shelves are full. What's up with that??? Hey how about stocking some helpful employees? No scratch that stock some Mr Pumice you seem to never have that.

Nice 99 cent menu... better then the then others that are around. The service was fast and friendly and the food was actually good.  I keep forgetting about this place for a quick bite out with the kids because its sort of hidden in a corner next to Dennys where the parking is mostly all for Dennys. Now I will try to remember because there is something for everyone on the value menu. And I will carry their coupons with me too just in case I do happen to stop by. They do happen to send out some awesome coupons that will even make it cheaper. yay!!!

I really like this UPS location . Everyone here is so friendly and patient. As I write this review I can see their smiles on their happy faces. I know these guys sometimes have some rough days but they always seem like some cool folks. This location is just off the 303 freeway near the Albertsons grocery store.

So far so good. I come here for my antipasto salad. I can always tell when there is a different chef preparing it. But always happy with the outcome. Looks like they may be under new management not too sure. But what I did notice is the lunch salad seems smaller than before. It has been plated in a smaller bowl. Just thought I would throw that in. Other than that some good salad and a few passion bread bites and I am happy.

First time here. I have passed this restaurant for years now and I have never ate here. I decides to try it last year after buying a groupon. My groupon expires today just in time before my brothers birthday. Now I have to say it is a nice little cozy place nestled on a corner close to the freeway. Parking is limited. There is a line of spaces in the back of building maybe holds a good to 12 cars against a 3 ft brick wall right by the alley. Don't let the location chase you away.  The building itself is cute lined with arched beautiful windows. When you walk in you can seat yourself someone will come to you and take your order.  The inside is nicely decorated with typical Mexican decor Pancho Villa pictures and all. Not overly done but tastefully done. You will be served fresh hot chips with mmm mmm salsa. I bit spicy maybe for the weak but still full of flavor. We had an excellent waitress and she made sure our basket and salsa was always full along with our drinks. Water is not tap lol so that was nice I was a bit thirsty so didn't mind the refills. We ordered the platter with seafood for 2 you get a salad Mexican potatoes and rice. The platter was abundant with several tasty items sea bass grilled and breaded. Shrimp grilled AND lightly breaded and bacon wrapped and to top off a lobster tail. It truly was alot we definitely could not finish. If you ever are in the area and would like some authentic Mexican dishes stop by Rita's.  The menu will not disappoint anyone there is something for everyone.

Paper is what this place has. I like the prices on cases of paper.  Staff is nice. So if you are looking for paper of any kind this is where you go. There is also envelopes, boxes, colored paper, laser paper, rolls of paper, invitation paper, big paper, small paper, binder paper, light paper, heavy paper, card paper. Just ask and someone there will help you.  Give it a try if paper is what you need!

Maybe it was that uncomfortable stare down when I walked in or maybe it was the pure uncomfortable feeling when we pulled in to get gas. This location has hookers and tweekers scattered up and down the streets in this area. Hanging out by entrance. Well at least I got gas. Could be worse...I could have been stuck out in some desert or strange town where chainsaw massacre kills me or the hills have eyes captures me and kills me slowly.

I do not go to the malls too often. I did used to come to this one year's ago. This mall is packed. There aren't too many great stores. Just the basic ones. I remember when it was a bit nice. Things have changed over the years. You do have to factor in the location. Nothing against the westside just saying lol. Anyway... there is a messy Burlington,Dillards,Sears, kmomo, footlocker, some discount stores oh a food court. This mall is not too big. But ok enough. Best time to go is during week.

I love this place one of my favorite Chinese food places to go to. You get so much food. Sizzling rice soup is bomb. I love everything I have eaten here over the years. I also love to have a nice cup of hot tea too. The service is fast and friendly. Everything is fresh too. You know these guys must be doing something right if they have been open probably almost if not more than 20 years.

This little place is a gem. Great lunch specials. My yelp buddy has told me that this place has been here for years and not a thing has changed. When you walk in its quite dark with decor that has probably been here since opening many moons ago. But putting that aside the smells are awesome. Seating is mainly booth style with maybe 4 to 5 rectangular double tables down the middle of the dining area. Each booth is separated by old mexican style blankets which blocks light but gives a cozy feel. Waitresses are hustling and always attentive. I am pleased with the service they provide.   While you wait you are served chips and salsa. Chips are made to perfection. Two different style salsas are served with them one slightly chunky and one smooth with mild heat both are red. I had the lunch special beef taco and tostada. Both were delicious. The beef taco is made of tasty shredded beef nestled in a perfectly crunchy shell. Lettuce and shredded cheese top it. Simply made. Full of deliciousness. Tostada is made the same way. The shells of both had the perfect crunch. My choice of side was rice. The rice was good. I ate it all. Once you get the check you get up and pay at register. And you are out. I did not mention parking in beginning. There is parking on side of building and in the back of building where abandoned offices are but I do believe the resteraunt owns them for storage. If there is no parking there you will need to resort to street parking.  It is always a good sign of a good place to eat when you can't find parking. The times I have passed this place the lot has always been full. Seems to me this place is doing something right all of these years.

I like Kohls. .There are times that I find something for myself and then there are times that I don't. Either way I always find something here. It seems to me that they always have racks and racks of clearance. I love clearance but its all over the place and its just not that organized. I like that you can just go into dressing room and that they have enough rooms in there and that you are not waiting in line to. So far the cashiers that I have had were really nice. I think I will go again soon I have some Kohls cash to spend ,

I do not come here on a regular basis when I have come here with family we chose IHOP over Dennys.  After coming here my next choice will be anywhere else but IHOP. I do not like the choices or the menu change. Everything seemed very generic and bland not only to me but everyone else. It is not worth the prices. I know times change but even simple menus at other places have more effort to make food taste good. Besides that the service was great. These ladies work hard and did deserve the tip for their service.

I am so happy with this spot. The only thing missing for me is the Bahn Mi. Loved the spring rolls the pork is seasoned and grilled not boiled. This gives the roll a different taste. A very delicious taste. Shrimp was cooked perfectly not chewy. Peanut sauce is on point. I could eat just this for lunch and be satisfied. I did order the beef pho and enjoyed every drop of it. The broth is not not as aromatic as I am used to so maybe a first time pho eater would take to it. I like that it does come out piping hot which makes the first sip of broth just run through your soul. And that is an amazing feeling. Warms the tummy. The resteraunt is clean an cozy. Our waitress was very nice and extremely helpful. There is seating outside too. I will most definitely be back.

This Best buy was very busy. But it was Monday 2 days before Christmas.  I did have to stand around waiting for a rep to come and open a case for me to help out a friend because he was looking for someone also.   I assume to prevent theft of a IPod they took it away from me to give to a cashier. LOL I am not a thief but he kind of treated  me like one. He could of used better words or a different approach. I do understand why but it was just weird. I actually walked around with more expensive merchandise at other Best Buys with no problem. I prefer not to come to this location ever again lol.

Five stars because it smells so good in here. I want to get something here so bad. The people here are helpful and so nice. You can get lost in here and trapped in the small spaces in between scooters motorcycles ATVs and all the fun stuff. There is not much room to walk around when you constantly run into toys and accessories. Very tempting. Wish I was Rollin in the dough it would be on and crackalackin.

Nice cozy place to have lunch. The waitress was nice and attentive. I had the side ceasar salad it was very good but 7.00 was pricey ! I had the parm panini. It was ok I felt that the ham was a bit to tough for me it should of been tender and thin sliced. The mozzarella and basil was the best part of the sandwich oh and was not warm enough. My cousin had the eggplant dish. She said it was actually good it looked good to. another problem we had here was that they did not have bread. You need bread some meals. We asked for some and I think they ran to bashas and bought an old baguette. they cut a piece off and then cut that into fours it was cold and stale. So overall I think its too pricey just for lunch food was ok the service was great. Thats why I give this place a 2. just because its in Verrado doesnt mean it deserves another star.

I am not reviewing the store yet just the gas pumps.  I do not like the arrow deal that you have at this  FRYS gas station.  Half the world does pay attention to the lines and arrows on pavement to go in a certain direction.  But at the same time the other half does not.  Just get rid of them.  The ones that do not use arrows are making getting gas a struggle at this location.  I have came here to these pumps several times and see the same thing every time. Ok I am done.

This location is not stingy with the portions. The staff is very quick and some what friendly. I can't complain it's fast food and they need you to get your stuff and go. Now if you plan on being snobby. Just dont. Please be nice to your servers and you just might get the same in return. It does seem darker in the seating area inside so if the weather is great enjoy your meal outside. FYI I did not get e coli.

On the Northwest corner of Mcdowell and 7th avenue.  Very congested gas pumps.  Of course this is expected at the time of day.  Just had to make an emergency gas stop. Did not go in. Just waited in line for gas. Please do not park at gas pumps just to go inside and get a drink. That is not cool.

I have shopped here many times to get a few things. I really like the juice bar everything is fresh and so delicious. I sampled every single fruit water and the horchata. Each and every one was refreshing and tasty. I get the fresh tortillas still nice and warm. I still need to try the eateries inside. Maybe when I have time. This place is not as packed as it was when it first opened. I still remember when it was abco many years ago. My husband said it used to be an alpha beta before that. Wow.

Cute little General store across the street from post office.  They have saddles cowboy hats sunglasses food if you need something quick on way home they also have beer. This store also serves pizza and subs I have not yet tried them though I did have a pretzel.  It was warmed in the microwave  packed with salt but you get a lot of cheese. I will never get one of those again. I like the popcorn though.

Waiting area has been remodeled. Shilo Thomas is the express lane advisor.  Smart friendly young man. He knows his stuff. So unfortunately I have to wait for the master tech. To fix an electrical thingy in my headlight.  Hopefully this issue will be resolved quickly. Other than that all of the other techs are so nice and down to earth. So far so good. Also nice to hear tips on new restaurant that opened across the street. Rudys. Hearing good stuff.

I really like this place. We had very good service. The waitress was friendly and helpful so we're the other employees.  I ordered the special beef dish can't think of the name now but it was a bit on the spicy side which I really don't mind. This dish came with naan bread and a delicious side salad oh and rice. They do not skimp on rice. And fyi if you order it as a side you will get the same amount as you would if it came with the special. I decided to upgrade the bread to spicy and that was pretty good too. If you are not into the spicy thing don't do it or even order the beef special I will edit the review later when I get the name of it. own The beef was so tender it just melted in my mouth. I was very pleased that I didn't have to chew meat for five hours or choke to death. Please try the tandoori shrimp appetizer it is the bomb.  the shrimp is very tasty and it seems grilled it has some char like it was. It lies on a bed of some grilled peppers and onions. You will receive a few sauces with your appetizers and they are very good.one is red one is green and the other is a pickled ginger kinda sauce. Each one has their own unique flavors. So it is totally up to your own taste buds. Oh my friend ordered the tiki masala dish and that was so good.  The chicken was cooked to perfection in the beautiful curry sauce. I think it's curry but if you eat Indian food you know what I am talking about. They say most of this food has been cooked in clay ovens. That is why it has an original old school flavor. I will tell you that I will be back. I want to try the wraps. We seen this lady across from us tearing up a wrap... and I am sold. More reviews to come.

Large open area to sit and have your lunch. But just ordering your food seems like a hassle.  The time that I went to have lunch there was not a friendly face to help.  My friend was in the middle of ordering her sandwich by maybe someone that did not know what was on the menu then in a split second someone took over and asked to repeat order all over again.  I then proceeded to order and felt like i had to hurry up or else.  I ordered the disgusting new soup and half a dry plain tasteless turkey sandwich just thrown together like they did not care.  There are several cash registers that had someone standing next to them so I just went to the one at the end of the line to pay just to lose my spot and wait in another line to pay with a grouchy old lady.  I wish I did not come here to spend my money or waste my time. My soup which looks good on the mailings that i receive in mail (yakisoba) was bland. I would rather eat paper.  Sorry Paradise Bakery you are not what you used to be years ago when you had delish sandwiches.

So I finally tried it and it was ok we had the baked spaghetti plate that Guy had on DDD ....um not all that ...so dry there was not enough cheese or sauce. It was nothing like it was on tv it was like dried block of spaghetti. But what I did like was the Italian Stalion pizza. Now that was the best thing served that day. My son got the spaghetti with sausage ....no flavor whatsoever.  We ordered the cheesecake at the end and those fried dough balls covered in powdered sugar. Then the waiter forgot about us. We ended up getting those dough things for free. I have tried them before at an Italian festival and the were so light and powdery delicious I thought I was going to experience that again. NOPE... the dough was chewy cold  and gross. Basically fried pizza dough. Well I can say the Carmel drizzled cheesecake was bomb.  I say go ahead and try it you may like it then you might not. That's my review for this place. I think they did their best for Guy and Food Network. Not for me

Was excited to come back but this time was not to happy with the sandwich choice. I got the mufletta. It was bland and not tasty at all. Olive spread was gross. The ham was salty and to over powering. Pulled that out and that went to waste. So I will never order that sandwich ever again. The home chips that they serve have no flavor. That's ok because my big chip bag contained about 5 and a half chips. Never again... service was ok just seemed like the staff was in their own little world. Tables were dirty too. I like which wich   but I was just not feeling it at this location.

I guess same as any other Bevmo. I had one of the rudest staff member ever. I asked about the etched glasses for beer and it seemed like I was bothering him. He was no help at all. Didn't even try to promote the refillable beer bottles to me when I asked him about those too. Yikes bad customer service!

I really like it here. I do not like the wait though. It is worth it to wait. If you ask for water while waiting they will give you a nice icy glass of water which helps because it is warm out.  You get nice filling portions. They do charge for Orange Juice refills. I ordered the Shrimp Po Boy. This is new on the menu. Bread is so soft but way to soft for this sandwich. Bread will get a bit soggy because of the sauce they put on it. Shrimp is not exactly Louisiana style. It has ok taste to it but not spicy enough the breading on the shrimp was a bit too undercooked. Everything falls out when you try to bite into it. I do not recommend this sandwich to anyone that has had a good one before from somewhere else. If you don't care how a Po Boy is made and you like a big sandwich to get full off then I guess go ahead and get it. I will just stick to the other things on the menu like the Pot Roast sandwich or chicken fried steak plate. I have eaten here before and was very satisfied with what I got. I just wanted to try something out of the ordinary and new from here. I give Black Bear 5 stars because of everyone else  plates and my previous experiences eating here. Oh and I love the red skin mash potatoes here the are the bomb thought I would throw that in. If you sign up to be on the mailing list you will receive a free meal on your birthday.

I like Honey Baked Ham. I did use a Christmas gift card to get some goodies. I have been told there was turkey and ribs sold here. And there is.  I never knew that there were other meats other than ham. I ended up getting some ham and turkey pulled pork and some white bean soup mix that I am going to make this weekend.  The turkey is very good nice and moist and has the brown sugar on it that the ham does. It comes sliced so you can make turkey sandwiches. I have not tried the pulled pork yet that will be for a quick dinner one of these days I will update that later. What I did like was the friendly and patient employee that took her time with me and didn't try to rush me out the door because they were almost closed by the time I got there. Thumbs up for being very helpful tool.  I did save some of my gift card so I can make it for lunch here one of these days. I bit pricey but good for special occasions.

Now this is the place to come for some real good tacos. Price is inexpensive and you get the real deal tacos. Flavorful carne asada fast service and salsa bar.  Staff is real helpful for those who can't make up minds. I like this place because I know I can get some good eats with family and friends. They do have an outside patio with plenty of seating for a group. Now this is how you eat simply and deliciously.

This location is not to bad now that I come here so much for business. Got to know all the friendly faces. They know me. The major problem I have is the parking here. I do happen to notice that landscaping here is out of hand. Well not only here but at most of the post offices that I go to. Wonder why? Hmmm. Going back to the service inside ... These guys bust butt. They work hard. I feel they can only do so much. I see the stuff stuff that they put up with while I wait in line. I just suggest please treat your post office people with respect and they will give you respect in return.

I am a fan because I do like This super target. It's huge. It's clean. It's organized. They do have a whole lot of registers but not so many cashiers. Oh those guys must show up near the holidays.  Well anyway they do have good clearance but you must make it before the housewives get there. I also find it slightly difficult to coupon here but that could mean some have ruined it for others. This is my Wal-Mart get away. Oh and the parking lot has a nice sound system lol.

This location is busy. I was happy with the prompt service and good food. I have visited the other locations in the past 75th McDowell and Estrella parkway and McDowell and this location is by far the the friendliest. Next time I feel like soup and salad without ghetto or cold treatment I will definitely stop at this location.

I love PHO.  I can come here and tear it up. I love that the location is near. I have tried the beef Pho and it hits the spot every time. It is clean and refreshing. Good enough for me. It hits the spot when you have had a few beers the night before. It also hits the spot if you just want some good ol soup. I am also a fan of the spring rolls and the sandwiches.  Everything is fresh and its just a good food that does not weigh you down on a busy day.  The prices are inexpensive. Quite affordable for the big family. So far I have not had any problems with the service or food.  For now I will keep a good rating on Central King Eggroll.

Another place I had to try for lunch. No wait time was seated immediately. Waitress was definitely on top of things. It was a bit dark in there we read the menu by the light of the 52 big screen tv's they had. Or was it 54? Well anyway besides that my lunch was good. We started off with fried pickles. I have never had them before so we decided to get them my good friend Angela has had them before not from here but somewhere else and she makes them herself.  So it was time for me to try...I get it they could have been better but the breading was like a cornmeal coating I expected a batter dipped pickle. The dip was disgusting. An orange like concoction of wing sauce and mayo um yuck. Those were sent back. I ordered a honey bbq chicken salad for lunch and I must say that was pretty tasty. They did not drench the chicken in honey bbq. I was pleased with the size. I got full so I was happy. Angela ordered a buffalo chicken wrap I  it looked good too. Wraps come with a side of chips and salsa. Chips are good I like they are light thin and crispy. I would have eaten some of it but I hate to pig out someone else's lunch. Good thing I didn't cause I left full. Ok now yes I would come back again. Oh Monday's are double punch Monday's too. They give you a card and when those get punch full you will get 5 dollars off next meal. That's not bad because they do have specials.

Great lunch specials. Priced 6-7 dollars. Served in a bento box you will receive soup eggroll and salad with your choice of white or fried rice.  I choose the hot and sour soup. And it is very tasty.  I like the chicken lo mein.  This place is under new management and the servers are very nice. If you have been here before you will notice that they knocked out a wall for a more open dining room.  I like this better.

Food is ok.  Service not so good. The guy that helped us was not too friendly kind of had an attitude. They did not have a few items that we asked ordered. My brother swore he has eaten pepper steak at another Filipino restaurant while this guy insisted that no one sells pepper steak. Well tell you what Halo Halo has it... My neice had the pancit it was kind of overcooked and had way too much celery in it.  That is something I will never order again if I happen to be on this side of town.  I had the sinigang I really enjoyed that. 5.00 for a small bowl. Lumpia was veri tiny smaller than my pinky finger. This side was good if you just need to sample it. Lechon is not bad at all.  This is the plate to get if you are craving some good eats. I wish they would serve more.  So basically the prices are a bit high for the servings.  Flavors are all there but just feels like there could be a little more to it.  Maybe its the open seating in a food court atmosphere.  Good luck with finding a clean table.  I just dont think I would load up a bunch of family just to come and eat here.

I come here every sunday morning to pick up my sunday paper. I do a walk around  because I do end up finding good stuff. Name brand items for 99 cents. They also have good Halloween items and when Christmas comes around they actually have good decorations. I also find items there that I do see at a regular grocery store that may cost over 2 or 3 dollars. So I really like it here but in reality you cannot do your whole grocery shopping here. I see people load carts with stuff like its the end of the world. They end up spending over 100.00 on mostly generic stuff. Oh well. Cashiers here are cool.  This store is next to Central King Eggroll.

Love the pizza....but wings are very small.  I will try wings again but if they are small I will never buy them again.  The garden salad was so fresh and it was good too. Can't wait to try other things here. So this may be my new place for pizza and salad...maybe wings we shall see.....

This was was my first time here. I was really excited to try this place out I have heard so many good things about it. Parking sucks... drove in circles then found a spot. The building itself lookes like it was closed but it was just the shades that made the windows look blackened.  I was seated immediately. The waitress was not much help when I asked a couple questions. So I just went and ordered what I was familiar with a gyro and side greek salad. I did order the cilantro hummus now that was very good. Tasty perfectly creamy and well seasoned. Glad that came out because I was starving. And it took forever to get my lunch. I kinda almost wanted to pay for my hummus and leave.  I couldn't though because as everyone else was getting served my taste buds and stomach told me not to. I kept seeing plate  after plate brought out to my neighbors. I wish my server offered me some of the other things that I was seeing. But oh well. When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there. It was actually good. Now I have had gyros at a few places and I just kept thinking is this pita from frozen?  I have seen pita bread that has been frozen and thawed before and it looked exactly like this.  When I have had pita at other places it looks like the Greek dude in the back hand made that sucker. Just wondering.  Oh and another thing is if you are serving hummus please provide enough thawed out pita. I do have to admit the hummus was delicious. My gyro was huge and filling and the price was not bad for it. But this is just another joint for people to say OMG Hey lets hang at the pita jungle and be cool. I think its a nice place to come for a business meeting or meeting of something. And lighting does suck in there.

These guys here at this location are nice. They help you out and they seem to have extra people working there. I remember back in the day it was a long wait. I am glad that they put a small seating area over by the windows but I do think that they should put more. Not everyone that goes in needs a phone. They just come in with the people that need one.  Oh and kids need a place to sit. I notice that people do have to bring their kids and those kids just know that T mobile means boring... This is my favorite location though.  This location is so much better than the one on Cotton Lane. Oh and parking sucks.

If you want unfriendly service come here. I don't care for subway much but for work lunch meetings this place seemed like the place to go for something quick and simple. The service is poor. I hope these ladies take a class on customer service because  your ghetto mad faces and attitudes are giving your subway a bad name. Just saying. I may have to look for another location for future meeting purposes.

357... I like it here not because of the gas prices but because of the nice cashier and the cleanliness of this store. The location is just perfect off the 303 highway. If you are low on gas you can get off at Bell and go west this little convenience store is in the Albertsons shopping center in clear view of the street. There is a O Reily's Auto parts next door if you need something for your car and a drive thru Jack in the Box for fast food.

The staff here is very helpful. They have a nice little sale going on right now.

They don't have bikes for sale but they do have all the accessories that you need. This will be my go to place.

I am a fan of this location because it conveniently located off the 303  not to far from the office. I do find some things that are cheaper than the location by my home. that is weird. Well I like this one because the lines are not so long when I go. But maybe that is because it is not the weekend.  I will continue to come to this location. Oh and I really like the yogurt parfaits they are the bomb and cheap.

This is the place we get our pizza from when its pizza night. It tastes good the people are friendly and the price is not bad at all. Since we have moved out here my husband craves Angie and Jimmies and that is too far to go to. So after passing Taste of Italy many times and smelling the aroma coming from that building I swore to myself we are going to try it. Once we did we were hooked. We did try other places in the area but non are like this place. My brother in law came to stay for us with a while and when he did I swear he wanted to order from there almost every night. eeeek good for Taste of Italy but bad for us lol. We had the baked Ziti a while back and that marinara sauce is sooooo good. The fried zucchini is really good too. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Lunch specials are not to bad.  Loved the Antipasto salad.  Perfect lunch portion. Lettuce cut to perfect bite size pieces. Everything in the salad from meat to olives were so good.  The house dressing it is delicious. Friend had the calzone. Looked different. Well it looked more like a ricotta calzone more than anything. I might not ever try it. She was told there was mozarella and pepperoni and sausage but I really didnt see any of that going on.  Oh and they do have New York water you can serve yourself. lol.  That was pretty good with some lemon.  So try to make it ther before the lunch rush and you may get some decent parking.  They also have valet if you feel like parking right by the building and do not like to walk. I will be back!

Just happened to notice this place as I was leaving the food court. We did because we are going to try El Salvador food when we take our trip to California. We have never had it before and we were curious. Everything on the menu looks really good. So we just decided to pick up a papusa. These looked popular because I would u of see people ordering and walking away with several on plates.  The nice girl that works at the counter did tell us the popular papusa was the bean cheese and pork and of course I ordered 1 to go.  She was also nice enough to say that it takes 8 minutes to make I was totally fine with that.  Now to the papusa ...it's a delicious flattened circle of masa filled with beans cheese and pork fried and seasoned to perfection it is served with a side of slaw like salad. I will give 4 stars now hopefully I can give 5 when I go back. And you have guess a the food is authentic if you see people from the old school in groups lining up to eat there.

I hope we get some Asians out here to open up some businesses in some of these empty spaces that are all over. We need good food out here!!!!!

I really like Chipotle. I like how its just simple and fast. My favorite meat here is the Barbacoa. I was quite surprised that it was so tasty and tender. This is my choice of meat here. Everything on the line is pretty good from the rice and beans to the salsa and chips. Rice at this location is perfectly cooked not to hard and not too mushy. you can taste the cilantro and a hint of lime. I have heard at other locations from a friend that they have overcooked it or maybe put too much water in it and that sucks. But anyway what you do is just walk along the counter and tell them what you want and they put it in a burrito or bowl for you. Easy. So they ask you if you want chips at the end. The chips are so good they are lightly salted with I believe sea salt and they have the right crunch to them. I only go to Chipotle for Chipotle food. Once in a while I say hmmm I feel like Chipotle. When I want Mexican food then I go to real Mexican food place or my mother in law or any of my friends house. I do have a white friend that cooks like a Mexican too. Well anyway Chipotle is nice for fast tasty food on your lunch break or happen to be out and about. Yes I am a fan :)

This is a very quick and friendly Chipotle. The staff is always outgoing and helpful. If you need lemons you need to ask. Make sure your chips are fresh. First time I ate here they were stale. But I simply went back and the young man made sure I got some fresh ones. You can sit outside to enjoy what's left of our awesome weather but there are only 2 tables to do so. Other than that seating inside is plenty.

So glad that I we came here for lunch. We tried spring rolls they were so refreshing and light. Perfect appetizer. Then on to my lunch....I tried shaken beef with garlic yakisoba type noodles. This was bomb. The beef was so tender and well seasoned a a sauce that makes my mouth water as I write this review.  My friend had the pork lunch special which came with a bowl of soup salad and rice. I give both these plates a thumbs up big time. Service was outstanding. I did notice they had alot of regulars. I do like to see this. There is inside and outside seating. The only thing that killed me was my plate was 16 dollars. I had to try what everyone was talking about on yelp. It was worth it to me. Sometimes it's ok to treat myself lol. What made this lunch nice was that I enjoyed it with good company. I will definitely be back.

Chicken citrus avocado salad. I did try this salad because I like everything that's in it. Glad we had coupons. It was ok it just seemed like more lettuce than what the picture looked like. I like really good thick salads so if I am going to pay 8 dollars for one it better be a mega salad. It is El pollo loco so they could have put a bit more chicken on that sucker. Maybe a few more slices of avocado. Well it was tasty though. I really like el pollo loco the chicken is bomb. Wish they had one closer to me. :(  I am still a fan though.

I have tried Raul and Teresas breakfast. It was very good and simple. I had the Chorizo and egg breakfast and liked it alot. The chorizo was actually very good and it came with beans and tortillas. Not bad. We were served chips and salsa before our meal and enjoyed that also. We did actually wait for a while for our meals to come to us but luckily we did not have any starving kids with us. I will go back and try lunch or dinner then I can give a better review. The breakfast I had was worth going back to try it again.

Happened to stumble across this store as I was walking to my car from Dons cigar shop.  I did go in and decided to look around.  I was greeted by a friendly sales associate.  He seemed very honest helpful and knowledgeable. He was not pushy at all. I will definitely go back when i need to get my spray for the yard.  This place sells weed and bug spray they even have traps and poison for the bigger critters. Parking is limited.

I still need to make several more trips to this place because everything on the menu looks delicious. I have tried the frybread with the green chile. It is so good. The bread is perfect. The green chile is very good. I have also tasted the red off my husbands plate and that also very good. I recommend this to anyone who loves frybread done right. They also have soups. I need to try the albondigas but everytime I have went they did not have any. I did have the calavacita soup and it is very good, clean tasting and filling they will serve it with plain frybread pieces if you like. They have friendly service and it is very clean and simple. This is place is a hidden jewel. I highly recommend trying it. Oops almost forgot... they have the bomb salsa it is also delicious mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Total Wine is my choice over Bevmo.  I just like everything about it. What else can I say?  There are far more choices. Its more of a cozy relaxing atmosphere.  I can spend a lot of time here just browsing. Maybe it was me just being thirsty. But I can say there are a quite bit more CSRs there ready to assist with whatever you need.  As I passed a few helping other customers I happened to hear honest opinions in choices.  They weren't trying to force sell anything.  And believe me what I heard was something I would say about something that I have tried.  They also carry my Bud Select which is nice to know that I can pick that up if I cant make any decisions on what to drink.  I am sure I would the next time I visit.  I do plan on being dutchess of Total Wine.

First time here and was happy.  Its is very simple you walk in get a hamburger if you tell them what you want one two or three patties tell them what else you want off the menu to put on your burger and that it not very difficult. Burger Fries  I think they do have a a hot dog or something on the menu but you really go there for the burger and fries.  Fries are awesome !  They have stacks of potatoes lined up as  you walk in and stand next to them in line. When they run out someone comes and grabs a bag so they can freshly cut those bad boys and then into the deep fryer they go.  I did try my fries with malt vinegar for the first time ever and the taste just explodes in my mouth. Mouth is watering as I write this..... I do also love how they have the fancy soda machine. This machine rocks because I do get my Cherry Ginger Ale. And that makes me happy.  So when I crave these mouthwatering fries I will know where to go. 5 Guys Burgers and Fries.  Um the prices are a bit high. So I can tell you that I will crave fries more than the burger,

So far so good. This was our first time eating here and we were not at all leaving hungry and unsatisfied. Staff was very patient and polite and very helpful. She also offered coupons on top of our online deals and that right there saved us half off of everything. We all had a different kind of butter burger. All extras are also free I couldnt tell you which one was better than the other so try whatever your heart desires at the moment and you will not be disapointed. I did take a bite of everyones burger so I know they are all good. We also had onion rings cheese curds and chili cheese fries. I just love those cheese curds I will always order those everytime I go. One thing in my opinion is that the burgers are a good kinda greasy so grab some wet naps at the condiment station. I also feel they lack in the salt in fries and maybe in burger too if you want some salt with your buttery burger there is nothing wrong with that. If you are on a diet you shouldnt be eating here anyway. I will mention they do serve salad but why suffer watching everyone else indulge in delicious burgerness and topping it off with some good ol concrete ice cream? Not me... with all that being said I will come back I hope it goes as well as it did today. This will be a fam fave.

Great place to go when you have people with you. There are several trucks to choose from. The reason I say go with friends family or co workers is so everyone can try something different and you all can sample each others goods. The down side about going with a group is that you need to find a place to sit all together.  I love the glass jars of fruit waters one of the trucks sell. You get a big mason jar of fruit infused water that sits ice cold in the truck.  I believe its the Burger Amore truck.  That jar will cost you 5.00. and you get to take home with you to reuse. Be prepared to take a few dollars with you because you do not realize that you want to try everything. Good thing they all take your credit card. Its getting a bit warm out there so dress comfortable and have fun! Oh parking in a dirt lot located north of the trucks. Go at a decent time before it gets packed.

Nice Location off the 303 love that I can just jump off the freeway and pick up a few things that I need on the way home. For some reason I have noticed  the cashiers seem happy here. Maybe its management maybe its location. I have never been here on the weekend so I do not know how packed it gets here.  Wal-Mart is Wal-Mart. though.  Maybe I have just been lucky and came on perfect days when people decide to stay home or fill another Wal-Mart. Thumbs up so far at this location!

As soon as you walk in you and your party get stamped. Then you walk right into the counter where you you can order over priced pizza and wings. They offer a salad bar for 6.00 it's a one time deal you get to load op a plate with withered lettuce and sloppy fixings. The drink machines need service most of choices were carbonated tasteless water. Finding a place to sit with your family is just horrible tables are wobbly and quite small. It also seems there really isn't anyone that tends to them. When we finally found a caople tables next to each other we wiped them down our selves.  The luxury family style benches are located in the reserved for party area.The wait for 2 pizzas and about 15 wings seemed like forever. So why I give 2 stars? That is because every single game is 1 token! So yes I actually had some fun. Now if you put aside and ignore all the little children that run up to your tickets and try to rip them out. Or the inappropriate dressed women that do not understand this is a family establishment then I guess you will be ok. I am not going to complain too much about the staff. I did need a few things and they were very  nice and responsive. Reminder...these are mostly teens and young adults doing as much as they can in this hectic busy environment. As time passed this place just seemed to get busier and busier on a Saturday afternoon. Cashing in tickets for some cheap prizes was not bad at all though. That was wierd. I think my wait was like 2 minutes. In the end I needed to pee bad. I waited to go home just wasn't too sure if I could handle the restroom. If we had to wipe down our own table. I just didn't feel like walking into a disaster zone.  This place just needs to be a lot bigger. More tables that a family can actually sit together in. Better food. And maybe more staff. Well that's all I have to say. I might not be back. If so it will be a long while.

I really like this location it is so much faster than the one in Goodyear.  The staff is much more friendlier.  They also look like they know what they are doing. Easy access for me just to exit freeway and walk in and walk out. There are no drive thru tellers which is fine because there is plenty of parking in lot. This location is right next to Albertsons.

Always nice to come here. Every one is so nice. No one likes to go bank after work but it's not bad at all for me to swing by here. Right off the 303 in the Albertsons shopping center.

This will not be my to go to Thai place.  I am not saying that it was disgusting. I did eat my pad thai.  I did not like the spaghetti thin noodle.  I like the flat noodle.  My dish had more egg that was disguised as chicken.  So maybe I had 2 small flattened weird pieces of chicken and 2 shrimp.  I did not order anything else because lunch prices were like dinner prices. I did happen to see some reviews on PBS and I think it was quite exaggerated. I don't think I will be back. There has to be another thai food joint out here...

Love this location it is very busy though.  Well I guess all QTs are.  I wonder why they don't just build an extra island of pumps when they build.  I also wonder why they don't add extra registers.  Overall this location is clean and convenient. I love the many choices of drinks and ice,  There is something for everyones type of munchies.  They also have this area in the back where they make smoothies or concrete mixers.  I have not yet tried anything from the back of the store.  Oh this location does have a little sitting area if you have a minute to just sit I guess. I do like that you can drive behind the store to exit north or south.

I called for my brother to see if they had his favorite dish.  They said yes.  We traveled from Goodyear to Mesa.  Got there and they lie! Looked at the display of food they had and it looked like it had been sitting under the heat lamps for 3 days. I believe they offer buffet. So I was told.  I think regulars go here. I really dont think I will ever eat here.  So this is what led me to the Mekong Plaza. They may have good items here at Manila Sunrise. But I was turned off by the false information that was given over the phone.  For those of you that like this place sorry that I have to say these things but this was my experience.  Please enjoy what you like here. For those who have not been here give it a try. You may find something that brings you back.

Pad thai chicken is the bomb!! I love this dish. You get a good amount for the price. I want to try more dishes here. I have also tried the shrimp rice and the shrimp pad thai and they are good too.  When you eat in, there is a server there by the name of Ana and she is very nice. Excellent customer service and very pleasant to have as a server.

One of my favorite lunch spots. Green Chile is very good. New Mexico style. The green Chile burrito with beans is cheese is how I like it.  Red isn't bad either. Chimis are delicious. Love the shredded beef tacos. But if you just feel like beans....get a bean and cheese burro. Omg the beans are so delicious. Home made just like they are supposed to be. Beware you will get very sleepy after eating. Not good if you are working after a good lunch here.

Located in Buckeye off Watson. Staff is not friendly or very helpful. They seem to forget about you once the curtain is closed to your room. My friend has been here a couple of times and they neglected her needs.

Awesome Ice tea. Great service. Had the turkey wrap and it was really good. They use the Boars Head line so that is a plus. You get a choice of chips or pasta salad with your sandwich or wrap. Pasta salad a bit on dry side. The prices on some of the stuff that they sell here are cheaper than the cafe at our building so that is a plus. There is plenty of seating inside and out. If you check in you get  free scoop of ice cream.

Yes I am a fan so far. Had a breakfast burrito here and it was really good it was bacon potato egg and cheese. The portion was filling the taste was delicious. I know it seems plain. But you can tell bacon was good quality. You had breakfast in every bite. You know what I mean you get a burrito and you don't get bacon until the end or it has two pieces of potato and all egg or even when the cheese is not evenly distributed. You so t get that with this burrito.  Now I understand it is a deli so I plan on trying deli style sandwiches in future. The menu is packed of goodies I don't even know what to start with. I will not forget to tell you about the fresh baked goods the have in their display. Please take a good look at that when you visit. There is a sweet for everyone. The staff is friendly I did pick up so I did not have opportunity to dine there. One day I will let you know how that goes. There are daily lunch specials so that's nice to know. Prices are a bit higher but from what I hear it is worth it. I believe in good quality and that's what happens with good stuff.  I say give Archies a chance I will be going again. Thanks Angela for introducing me to this fine establishment.

Never again. 5.99 for a 6 inch Italian sub. FYI not an Italian sub. It's a bologna sub lol. Well it has alot of cotto salami. The bread was actually good. I don't know where it is ordered from but I liked it. Just by having this sandwichI have a feeling the rest of stuff is not so good. Sorry Farmhouse I am not a fan. Sometimes people find a gem in these little hole in the wall joints. Not here. For those who did give a decent review good for you and I am glad someone enjoys Farmhouse. I believe in supporting the local small businesses. FYI I did not smell food when I walked in. That was wierd.

Perfect chicken strips. Pretty good lemonade. Like the sauce not to bad. They do serve Texas toast. That's nice to have with your plate. Chicken is only thing on menu. Kids that love strips  will like this place. I like it.  Pretty simple place to eat if in mood for a chicken strip.

Don't think I will be back I am not a fan of soggy cold sandwiches and cheap tasting deli meats. The girl behind the counter was great. She was very nice and friendly. That can make up for my trip. but that will never give my money back for my nasty sandwich.  Sorry Jersey Mikes you may be good some but not this girl.

Recommended by a co worker. Location is Central and Camelback on the west side of Central.  Lee is the owner and he is really cool. He knows his stuff and he is very friendly.  He has a nice selection of cigars.  Sitting area is toward front of store and was full when I was there.  I like him because he talks to you and wants you to come back and looks forward to seeing you again.  He introduced himself and hooked it up with free cigar cutters. That was nice of him.  Even though he had customers he still made the time to come right back to you to make sure that you were good.  His store has a huge variety of the humidors. and other things to buy.  I am not a professional cigar toker but I have been to several places to pick up a cigar and I find this to be my favorite.  I think I will make this my go to shop from now on.

Nice clean new Goodwill just opened in Goodyear on McDowell and Pebble Creek parkway.  The lines went smooth. They are always stocking. I noticed that there were a lot of employees keeping stuff neat and organized. Hopefully this continues.

Parking Lot was empy Office was empty.  There are no visual signs reading hey this is Hanger Clinic!  so I just walked through a dark tinted door that happend to read Hanger in small letters.  Like I said the waiting room was empty.  But oh my, behind the glass was a whold office full of cackling hens just lauging and talking away. I stood there wondering if was looking into an interrogation room because I could see in but they couldnt even look my way.  Well anyway ended up leaving I really did not need a knee brace that bad.  I would rather get my own. Such a waste of time.

We were very pleased with everything. All ingredients were fresh. They serve huge amounts of food. The dinner combos come with egg roll cream cheese puffs lo mein with fried rice. We also got a free order of chicken fried rice.  Our dishes that had chicken was made with chicken breast. That's a plus. I ordered the chicken with veg in white garlic sauce. It was very tasty. Veggies were perfectly cooked still had the fresh crunch but cooked enough where you can taste the name of the dish. Spicy orange chicken was good wasn't overly sweet but had a light kick of the chili flakes. Chicken jalapeño was a little spicy but spicy enough for the person that likes some heat. Chicken and mushroom was really good too.  No can mushrooms used here. I really hope this place sticks around. I like Chinese food and panda express does not do it for me. Yans is near but I am not a fan. All  good Chinese places are ridiculously far. Now maybe I am overly excited to welcome this new establishment but who cares. Give these guys a try maybe for lunch  it's a few bucks cheaper. Let's help keep them in the community. We honestly need something different out here. I will go back. If my experience is any different I will yelp about it.

I really like this location it is a bit small. There are no crowds that I have ever ran into. It is convenient for me off the 303 freeway and Glendale. I can just drive and drop off mail.  If I have to go inside there are friendly faces there to help me. I wish I added this location a long time ago.  I would have had more check ins.

So far the employees are super helpful. The prices are decent. Coffee is not bad. The only problem I have is the drive thru. Kind of tight for big trucks. I have to try again to completely enjoy everything. the stars are for the coffee and staff.

. Much much faster. I had a nice young lady that was so helpful and patient with everything that I needed. There are so many window like MVD but more friendly faces. I will definitely be back in the future. I gave them 4 stars because I could not complete one transaction because the system went down.

Kind of new to the area. I have been here a couple times and was helped immediately. This place is clean the parking lot is clean. This location is not as busy as most in the city. I would recommend going here to avoid the lines that you encounter at other auto zones. The people that work here are nice and quick to grab the things that you need if you don't know where it. Building is located on the far southwest area of the Frys marketplace lot.

This is a very large furniture store. What I like about it is the selection. Prices are not bad either.  Usually when I go to furniture stores I am in and out. I actually found something that I did like for every room of my home.  My husband did not mind either probably because we do not have to go every furniture store in AZ.  I do recommend coming here if you are just browsing.  I was not stalked by any desperate salesperson. That was nice. I will update once I do actually purchase something.

I was really excited to give this place a try.  I hate to be a bit negative but I will be honest.  Rollover does have quite a few different doughnuts to choose from and the names and descriptions seemed very tempting to me.  I decided to buy a few so I can share the goodness with my family.  Bought 6 (pricey) but thought it would be worth it. They looked so good to me. The description of each doughnut was sounding good. Took them home and everyone had a taste of each doughnut.  There was no mmmm, there was no OMG. Just ehh ok.  So I believe it is the dough itself that just killed it.  The variety that I picked were the maple doughnut , pistachio,coffee cake doughnut, chocolate, and vanilla. To me the dough was very heavy. These doughnuts tasted like they were literally a week old. Everyone at home said that.  Maybe we did get old doughnuts.  I don't know. So a lot of people asked me at the office what I thought I said I didn't like them.  I didn't tell anyone not to try them. But no one wants to pay for a pricey doughnut and be disappointed.  Especially if you have that craving for just a doughnut. Just with that being said when we went to Food Truck Friday everyone went for the pies.

This new Winco is located off of the 303 freeway and Bell in Surprise. My first time here is during the grand opening. No parking and no cart available of course due to that.  I knew that was going to happen. There was only one way in and that was congested because a lot of the deals are right when you walk in and it continued as I tried to get through the produce.  That was also expected.  Then as I maneuvered my way through that I was able to walk freely through the large store.  This store has bulk goods and an good deals on meat.  I find that the prices are bit cheaper than Walmart and other competitors. You will find a random deal here and there and that is a plus. I found some awesome deals on meat.  Eggs are cheaper than the other stores. So if you are looking for a dozen eggs your best bet is to come here during the spike on eggs.  When I came here every register was open which made my checkout easy.  I cant say this will be the same after the grand opening but at this time it is nice. My cashier was super friendly. Winco takes coupons and that is a plus in my eyes.  You do have to bag your own groceries.  I will shop here in the future but I will continue to shop at other stores for sales.

Another great spot in west phoenix for some good carne asada. Good meat makes good food. Very simple menu. Salsa bar and lots of seating. Glad that they can recycle an old tire shop to a place where people can enjoy good food and leave happy and full. Wish this was around when I used to live out here.

Not very happy with the wait and my drink. Ordered the coconut boba. Tasted like straight milk. No coconut what so ever. Waited too long for 3 drinks. And paid like too much I even got small. So far best coconut boba I have tasted is Little Saigon in Glendale.
