Assholes. They close at 5:30pm and left me stranded in Phoenix. I tried to call at 5:22 to tell them I was 3 minutes away. No answer. Gates were locked at 5:31pm when I arrived. Not even a sorry when I arrived the next day. There are plenty of other places to get your Benz serviced in town.

I love coming here, food rocks, coffee rocks, even the cocktails at the hipster local joint. Shabby Sheik is a good look. However all the couches and comfy chairs look like they should be in an abandoned building. They are even too dirty and cracked for a homeless shelter. The staff is very friendly too. Time to hit the recycled furniture spots around town.

They like to hide that Happy Hour Menu at the bar so "ASK FOR IT". I had a little chuckle while they "pretended and tried" to look for it. They should be proud of that menu because it is pretty awesome. I enjoyed the roasted Brussel sprouts and the Cauliflower. Keep a look out for $6 Modelo and be careful to carefully select a Margarita or they will make you a 17.00 one with upgraded Tequila. I really enjoyed the Salmon Burger and Duck Fat Fries. The restaurant is awesome but they hide it in a strange way near the lobby ....Don't be shy march on to the bar and order up. Its worth it

Pretty good cuisine here, my wife forced me to play the AYCE game. I still had a great time and wound up ordering lighter dishes so I would not get filled up and feel like I hit a buffet or something. I took it upon myself to fix that nonsence with the new hours with the hostess. Fine job on the simple items and plate presentations. Loved the PB and J, Lettuce Cups and Fingers. Octopusy gets Chef Ant's thumbs up

Since 2014 new owners took over this place and they now have rocking sushi. I am so down with this place, it's our only sushi bar in Fountain Hills, but it is still pretty awesome. The Sushi chef always goes that extra mile to impress me with new rolls and fresh seafood. I have had both dine-in and take-out always the best. Cheers

That was a really nice lunch, food was great and the staff was very friendly. Tried almost every Empanada they had all of them were very tasty.

I will be nice and give you 5 Stars for the Iced Toddy and House Made Biscotti, but please please fix your WIFI. Understand that the expectation of a quality coffee house also having reliable wifi.

The food I ordered was really good, I had a Spinach Salad and Some Quinoa Stuffed Peppers. Pretty cool owners too. Its a really tough location in that spot so I really hope everyone gives it a try. Menu was small but they are planning to expand it. I would advise to please post the hours of operation and "stick to it". As a fellow restauranteur I would say don't give up and stay strong. -Ant
