Stay here if:  1. You enjoy being solicited every time you walk through the door or head for your room. 2. You love the stale smell of vintage cigarettes from 20 years ago. 3. You like housekeeping that does not respect your "do not disturb" sign 4. You like beds so cushy that your body sinks down and pillows so fluffy that your head is perpendicular. 5. You do not have extra money to spend and have exhausted all of your other options for accommodations.  Even despite #5, just go stay at a hostel or couch surf.

I DON'T GET IT!!  Everyone at my table of 6 found this place absolutely disappointing and unspectacular. 3 of us ordered the following dishes to share:  1. Smoked salmon toast- Thinly sliced smoked salmon with dill sour cream and capers. It was a'ight. The taste was nothing noteworthy. 2. Tuna tartare- Raw, cubed tuna with avocado in sesame oil. This was perhaps my favorite dish, with a great savory flavor. 3. Stuffed dates- Bacon-wrapped date stuffed with an almond and goat cheese. I commend them for the flavor matching of the sweet fig and the savory bacon. I can appreciate the different textures- soft fig with crunchy almond and creamy goat cheese. The favors were perhaps too bold for me that I could only eat one. 4. Roasted eggplant cannelloni- The eggplant was mushy, with a thick layer of mushy goat cheese. The textures did not bode well with me. The tastes were unremarkable. 5. Pulpo asado- Grilled octopus with potatoes. This is actually the best octopus I've tasted, simply because it was not chewy like other dishes I've had before.  6. Petit filet-  This was a'ight. I think I meant to get the sliders, but instead ordered the filet. I've definitely had better steaks. 7. Merguez- Lamb sausage was dry and not particularly tasty. 8. Sparkling sangria- Delicious and bubbly sangria.  Total price ~$30/ person  I do admit that my expectations were high upon entering. However, I do believe I've tasted much better tapas before. Firefly did not the mark for me or the rest of my table.

DELICIOUS.  A short drive away from the strip, but way way worth it! Here's what I had:  1. Deep fried calamari with eel sauce. Perfectly crunchy, not too chewy. It was the perfect start to a good meal. 2. Spicy ramen. This broth was really tasty. I've eaten at many ramen joints, but this broth is actually quite spectacular and savory and complex. It wasn't at my desired spiciness level, but the waitress left a bottle of ground chili to bring it to my liking. I thoroughly enjoyed this, but definitely wished there was a piece of char siu in it, or some kind of meat. 3. Sunkissed roll. Spicy tuna roll with salmon and avocado on top. This was my favorite dish of the meal. I am a huge fan of sashimi and fresh fish. The spicy tuna was okay, but what made me happy and brought me joy was the huge piece of fresh and tasty raw salmon atop the roll. Certainly some of the freshest salmon I've tasted.  I was so happy with this meal, especially having been deprived of good sushi for about half a year. The total for the ramen and roll was ~$22. Definitely a steal compared to those other pricey places on the strip.

The Spice Market Haiku  Champagne brunch is fun. Taste foods from around the world. All my meat is dry.  The end.

I got the Earl's Club, per suggestion of the cashier. The sandwich was decent, with warm, crispy bread, turkey, and bacon. It was just okay. I took a bite of my friend's chipotle avocado chicken, which was also okay. I took a bite out of another friend's Montague, which was, again, okay.  Am I missing something that everyone else seems to see in these sandwiches??

One Coffee Co was ridiculously close to my hotel in downtown Phoenix. The place was very quiet and contemporary. The woman at the register was sweet and easy to talk to. Originally, I was going to order a regular drip coffee, but my eyes wandered over to their specials board and saw "Mexican Mocha." I asked the barista about it, and she informed me that it was a mocha with a warm, spicy twist.  Sure enough, the taste of the mocha was quite shocking. I've had Mexican mochas in the past, but nothing like this one. Spicy upon first sip, I couldn't decide how I felt about it. But after the first sip, with the spicy warmth stuck in my throat, the next sequential sips were no longer surprising. The spice was meant to warm the drinker on a cold morning, while still being a pleasant beverage.  If given the opportunity, I would surely return to this wonderful coffee establishment!
