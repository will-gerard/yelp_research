Don't use the drive through! I used the drive through and got my meal and a kids meals. Not only did I sit at the speaker for 2 minutes before I could order but then something was going on with the car in front of me as it was almost 9 minutes before I got to the window to get my food. The guy at the window repeated my order to me and handed me the drinks and the bag of food. I got home ( about 10 minutes away) only to realize the kids meal was not in the bag! I called right away and was told the manager on duty said yes in fact there was a second bag of food that was not taken to the guy in the window. I was told that only coming back was the only option to make this right! So it was the fault of the restaurant and I have to drive 20 minutes to get a kids meal that they forgot to give me? I asked for a refund and was told "we don't do refunds" so then I asked to talk to the manager and was told he was too busy to come to the phone. Long story short I made the drive back so my kid got his food.  I then gladly did their on line survey and it asked if I wanted someone from the location to contact me, of course I said yes and left all my info and to no one's surprise it has been over a week and no one has contacted me.. I can only assume they have been too busy the entire last week to call.  Too many other fast food places around there that actually care about their customers for me to waste my time going back there.

Love this place. I make it there on Fridays for happy hour and the bar area is almost full by 5pm. Always something great to watch on their many TV's. Food is outstanding, for as long as I can remember I have not had a bad plate of anything. Wings are superb, nachos are best around! Friendly staff and the new management that is out on the floor greeting customers and checking on things. Highly recommended if in the area.
