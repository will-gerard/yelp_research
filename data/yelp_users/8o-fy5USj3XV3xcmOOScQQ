This place is a serious no brainer for vegans! Lots of options to choose from considering they have a vegan section on their menu. I got the vegan combo to go and everything was delicious. The portion sizes are large and I got over 2 meals out of my take out! I wish it was a bit spicier since siracha flows like ketchup in my house, but it was all very flavorful non the less. Tried the vegan raw strawberry shortcake dessert from new raw and organic menu and it was ok. I wasn't crazy about the frozen strawberry portion as it tasted like Italian ice, but the creamy filling and crust under that satisfied my sweet tooth!

Delicous pasties and great beer selection! They will make vegan pasties too if you call ahead of time to order.... What more could you ask for?! I email them asking if they have vegan options and this was the response (I hope they don't mind me posting this):   "Yes we can make vegan pasties with your choice of ingredients chosen from any of our vegan ingredients in the menu, or we can come up with a surprise pasty from one of our cooks...? Please just call the store of choice an hour and a half before you wish to eat."   Loving this place!

Disappointed! I must have caught this place on an off day, I am willing to try it again maybe at the hookah lounge during the evening. The falafel pita was good and the my dining partner enjoyed the gyro. We had ordered the garlic dip to start and we were immensely disappointed. It literally tasted like garlic mayonnaise. While I know some garlic dip is made this way, I was a expecting fresh, lemony potato or bread based garlic dip. Needless to say we hardly touched it, I wish they would have specified this in the menu so that I would have saved my money for the hummus.

I have been meaning to try this place for a long time as it is right by my office. I love, love love green curry so I ordered it with tofu with brown rice to go. After seeing my dish then reading the reviews, I just think that their curry is not their forte! It was watery, totally lacked the rich flavor I have come to expect from thai curry. The dish did not have a pleasant smell nor did it have any "zip" as I asked for medium spice. The veggies were fine but sparse (heavy on the bamboo shoots and carrots), but the actual curry left much to be desired. I will probably try another dish (maybe pad thai) at some point as I don't want to judge them solely off of one item! But for now, heed my warning and avoid the green curry.

I have been here before at the old location in Goodyear and was enjoyed my initial experience. However, the last time I stopped by their new location I was unimpressed and a bit frustrated. We arrived in a group of about 5 and ordered lots of appetizers, pizza and salad to share. I am not sure if our server was overwhelmed (there was a large military event going on at the same time) or new but we had a hard time with receiving our beverages we ordered- having to ask multiple, MULTIPLE times- club soda, coffee you name it- it was going to arrive towards the end of your meal.   We asked to start off with the hummus trio, garlic fries and stuffed crab mushrooms then the watermelon feta salad and farmers market pizza. The appetizers were among the last things to arrive (aside from our beverages we tried to order). Again, possibly a server input error. However the fries, pizza and salad were great! The hummus trio tasted awful not to mention the veggies served with it were frozen! I am not sure if they were placed too far back in the fridge and accidentally froze or if they intentionally freeze their veggies but it was bizarre and not appetizing, we left most of it on our plate. The hummus itself was not fresh as it had that slightly *tingly* mouth feel (the beginnings of the fermentation/expiring process). The only good part was the flat bread served with it. The crab stuffed mushrooms tasted and smelled extra fishy (again a sign of lack of freshness- but what do you expect when ordering crab in AZ). It was not worth the money we spent.   Lastly, we asked to split our checks at the end of the evening and the server seemed to deem this an incredibly difficult task stating that it would "take a while". I waited tables and bartended all through college so I know that it is not that difficult to divide a tab evenly among 5 people. Again, maybe our server was new.... To be fair we didn't give the management a chance to correct things as we kept silent about our issues with the food/waitstaff since we were just trying to enjoy a nice girl's night out and didn't want to ruin the evening by making a huge deal out of everything. Overall- I would just stop by for a quick coffee or wine but don't expect decent food or friendly/efficient service as they both seem to allude this restaurant.

The food here is wonderful and I am never disappointed! The owners are so friendly and the food is soooo flavorful. I was also happy to learn that they cater! I loved the vegan eggs benedict and the chicken salad sandwich is delicious. One time I had a tomato soup that was to die for. I am so happy to have stumbled upon this restaurant and plan on spreading the word!

The reviews are totally right! I had a Brazilian and it was the least painful I had ever had. D'Lisa was done in like 20 minutes flat and used 2 different kinds of waxes which made the experience comfortable and quick. I prefer this place over Suddenly Slimmer Day Spa, she was far friendlier and much more efficient. The salon itself is super cute, she offers snacks and a variety of beverages to keep you quenched while you wait. I will definitely be coming back here!

Scramble gets 5 stars in my book for having a vegan menu! Usually vegan breakfasts are limited to oatmeal and fruit cups, so I was pleasantly surprised to actually stumble across several options to choose from! The soyrizo tofu scramble burrito was pretty tasty, nothing crazy special. I was so happy that they had nutritional yeast, I added that for a cheesy kick. Cute place, wish there was one in the east valley!

I should have listened to the other reviewers but I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt. I bought the Groupon and scheduled a time for them to come out, got a call a 30 minutes before they were supposed to be there saying the housekeeper quit suddenly. I mentioned the other poor reviews I have read on Yelp about their company and she agreed with me that the company was having problems. The girl on the phone seemed genuinely empathetic and I was able to get a full refund through Groupon. So frustrating but I guess I shouldn't be surprised given the other reviews. My advice? Read the writing on the wall and don't even bother with this company, sometimes a deal really is too good to be true.

Obsessed. Period.   We have been ordering delivery from Miu's for quite sometime now and are slowly making our way through the whole menu. We have always been pleased with our delivery orders and have yet to be disappointed. We recently decided to venture out and dine in, we knew what to expect in terms of ambiance so we were not thrown off by it upon arrival. The restaurant was a little rough around the edges but seemed clean, the service was super friendly and the food was delicious as usual.   Here is our list of favorites:  Dan Dan Noodle (must order) Yu Xiang Eggplant (must order) Kung Pao Chicken Won Ton in Spicy & Sour Sauce Green Beans w/ Saut√©ed Garlic Sauce (must order) Lamb or Beef w/ onions Stir-Fry Mushroom (soooo fresh and an awesome mix of 'shrooms!)  Other items we have tried are:  Bean Thread in Spicy & Sour Sauce Water-Boiled Fish Spicy Lamb Rib  The portions are always large and we usually have a TON of leftovers. We are a little concerned about whether or not this place is actually making money based on how much food they serve at such a low price, we would hate it if they are operating at a loss. We want Miu's to stay around and would be heartbroken if it ever closed!   Overall we would highly recommend Miu's and will continue to support this restaurant!

Great food, great price! I am a fan! Got the two scoop spicy tuna and salmon. The staff was super helpful and patient since it was my first time in. Everything was super fresh, fast and tasted delicious. I got the house sauce, And did half brown rice and salad. I was a fan, I'll be back!
