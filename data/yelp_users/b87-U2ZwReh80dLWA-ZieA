I seriously thought I was going to cry the day the sign went up:  No more tacos.  Sorry.  This is not a punishment!  ~Rito's  But in reality it doesn't matter because everything else on Rito's menu is so wonderful you won't miss the tacos. My favorite - red burro, enchilada style. Amazing.  A couple of things to remember about Rito's: -No inside seating, which makes it difficult in the summer. -No credit cards accepted. -They are always busy, so expect to wait. -No use in calling in an order. Every time I have I have waited anyway.  The last time I was there, my lunch companion said "I love Carolina's, but this really is the best Mexican food in town." Even though I am a HUGE Carolina's fan, I have to agree.  P.S. Word on the street is they occasionally make tacos. If anyone wants to tip me off on taco day, I would greatly appreciate it!

I probably make it to the Rhythm Room at least a few times a year, and I always have a good time. The place is a sort of a dive but the bar staff is fast and the bands sound good. Their prices for shows and drinks are reasonable and if the music is not fabulous the people watching always is.

I cannot say enough about Carolina's. By far the best Mexican joint in town. It's nothing to write home about in terms of atmosphere, but that's part of the experience.  My favorite foods: - Any burrito, enchilada style with red sauce. Like everyone says, the tortillas are absolutely the best anywhere and that red sauce cannot be beat. - Chorizo anything. - The chips and salsa. I always buy an extra bag of chips to take home and the salsa is phenomenal. - Chocolate chimichangas. Small but oh so good.  Try this one or their location in North Phoenix. You will be beyond impressed.

I really like this place. The food is consistent and high quality, and the prices and service are excellent. They are often busy and the actual restaurant decor, etc. is nothing special, but you are there for the food, right?

It's your typical neighborhood nail place. The people are nice, and the prices are average. However, they do not appear to get pissed off when you walk in 30 minutes before close and ask for a pedicure, they take their time, and their work looks good and lasts a bit longer than the other nail places I have tried in the immediate area. Give them a shot.

Beware of the minute clinic.  Paid copay and bought $30 in over the counter drugs because they told me I had a bad head cold. A week later and a visit to an actual doctor and they said I had a sinus infection, ear infection, and pink eye. I told them about my minute clinic experience and they laughed and said they see people all the time getting awful care from clinics like this.  Total waste of time and money.

This place is pretty awful. I clearly did not remember how bad it was when I suggested it while shopping. Should have stuck to the food court. Menu is limited and expensive. Service is ridiculously slow. Flat sodas. Small portions (kids menu is a total ripoff). Asks for condiments, lemons, etc take forever. Taste of food is just meh. Bathroom is dirty with trash on floor. Lighting is awful and makes you sleepy. Expensive mistake to make while hungry. Next time, well, anything else.

So we finally tried Espos. We had a chicken burrito, enchilada-style with red sauce. We also took home chips and salsa, as well as some cinnamon crisps.   The prices were good, the service was fast, and the owner was super friendly, even offering a large bowl of salsa for our takeout order, which I think they normally charge extra for.  The salsa rivals Carolina's in terms of taste and quality. The tortilla that my burrito was wrapped in was also excellent. Chips were ok. Next time we will skip the cinnamon crisps.  I was a little worried about cleanliness issues, especially after I read the review about cockroaches. I opted against getting a drink, but everything appeared to be ok at least near the checkout area and the half of the kitchen I could see.  This is a much better alternative to the Filiberto's, etc. in this area of the Valley. Much more authentic.

How do I give NO stars? Ok, I get that it is Walmart and to some degree you have to just buck up and deal because it is going to be dirty, everyone who works there is going to by unhappy, etc. However, this Walmart hit a new Walmart low for me this week when I ordered a camera and storage card online to pick it up on this store.   The card was ready immediately, but the camera would not be ready for pickup for one week. No problem, except I received an e-mail that if I did not pickup the card with 48 hours the card would be put back on the shelf and I would be credited. So I called the store and politely explained that I would like to make only ONE trip to Walmart and asked if they could hold the card a few more days. Before I could finish, I was interrupted by a teenage boy manager and was told there was NO WAY they could hold it and that was policy, no exceptions. When I pressed him he told me I could not speak to the store manager and instead I should call walmart.com. Which I did, and they hung up on me. Awesome.  Bottom line: they were unhelpful and because I need the camera for work I kept the order. But that will be the last time I ever deal with Walmart.

I am addicted to The Buck. It is the only thing that I crave in the summer. The price is fantastic and the flavor choices are vast. Teenagers appear to run this location, but don't let that stop you. They are usually friendly and are always super fast.

Great pizza, but lots of confusion at this location about the groupon now deals. Showed up to pick up my pizza and was told I could not use it. Be careful.

I feel no guilt at all eating chicken, waffles, and mac & cheese from Lo-Lo's because their food is worth what has to be a ridiculously high caloric intake. The waffles are hands down the best I have had in the Valley. My mother will also be excited to know I will even eat the okra at Lo-Lo's (it's fried). Their sweet tea is also amazing, and everytime I go I wish I had a brought a jug with me so I could have them fill it up and take it home.  Improvements they have made over the last few years include an additional add-on to the restaurant (a converted house) for more seating, as well as some signage off of Central so you don't miss the turn onto Yuma Street.   For first timers concerned about the neighborhood and/or what some believe to be the strange combination of chicken & waffles -- JUST GO. I have been to Lo-Lo's at lunchtime as well as late at night and never had an issue. To the chicken & waffle non-believers - try it once and you will get it.

Frasher's recipe is simple - great food (St. Louis style) and an incredibly friendly staff. It's not the nicest place in the world (the booths could use some TLC) but it does have some charm.  The filet, smoked chicken, and ribs are all amazing. The side item choices you get with your dishes are also great. I would suggest the loaded baked potato and the corn.   The desserts are also fantastic. As mentioned by others, the gooey cake is excellent, as well as their cheesecakes.   My boyfriend and I can never seem to get out of there for under $70. Well worth it though! We plan on going back soon and trying the pizza, which always looks so good coming out of the kitchen to the other tables.  Frasher's is worth driving a bit south of Old Town Scottsdale and trying something off the beaten path.

Four Peaks is clearly well covered territory. Two quick things: - Run, do not walk, and get yourself some pumpkin porter. I rarely go to Four Peaks anymore but I went twice last week it was so good. When it goes away I am going to cry.  - Stay away from the Kiltlifter. It's good, but I can have just one and every single time I wake up with the most wicked hangover. I know several other people that say the same thing.

Basically, I have to be in love with a band and desperate to see them to suffer through a night at the Marquee. Although the location is convenient, the sound sucks, parking can sometimes be difficult, it's nearly impossible to get a drink at their bar, and they treat their customers like criminals.  They make you take your shoes off to get in the venue! Need I saw more?

P. Croissants keeps it fairly simple, so I am going to do the same with my review:  Croissants - AMAZING. Like everyone says, get their early. I really loved the cherry cheese, strawberry, and peanut butter varieties.   Sandwiches - Meh. Maybe my hopes were too high. They took forever to make and were just so-so.  Coffee and Espresso drinks - BOO. Overpriced and not very good. Go somewhere else for your java.

I basically love this place. Easy in, easy out by car and light rail. The beer prices went down, you can see from any seat in the house, it's always clean, and almost everyone that works there has a nice, pleasant personality.  Two recommendations:  - They need to check tickets. Nothing pisses me off more than when they allow everyone who paid $7 for nose bleeds to infiltrate the first level. Yes, they are empty seats, but the nose bleeders didn't pay to sit there. There are ushers at every section. They should check tickets.  - Get rid of Mike(?) and Vanessa. They are painful to watch and lend nothing to the experience. I don't know one fan who enjoys watching them. It looks like Chase Field just threw two ASU interns in front of the jumbotron camera.

This place is a dump. What happened? They could not even provide salt and pepper shakers. Seriously! And the bathroom stalls did not lock. Gross.

What can I say that has not already been said about Fez? It's fun, it's inexpensive, it's convenient, and the drinks are great.  In regards to the service, only once did I have an issue. We went during the lunch rush and waited several minutes for a table. The host forgot about us and ended up seating several other groups before I asked him about it. We ended up having to wait even longer. We were upset, but they offered us 5 drink coupons a piece for future visits. They made it right and since then I have had no problems.  Personal food highlights include the burgers, rosemary chicken sandwich, the lamb, and the fries. They also have wine fusions. Ask the server about them.   I remember the first time I ate at Fez. Something about it felt really different. I thought to myself  "Am I actually in Phoenix?" That feeling soon faded as I exited the restaurant and realized I was in a Kinko's parking lot. SIGH.  :)

Just saw U2 there a few week ago. And although the band was great, U of P as a concert venue stinks for several reasons: - Parking and traffic flow. The streets and freeway around the Westgate area were not designed to handle the traffic. After finally reaching the stadium, I was sent into one parking lot, only to be sent back out and then to another lot, etc. This went on for a good 25 minutes. Oh, and did I mention they wanted $20 to park?  - The sound was awful and my ears will never be the same. Now, I know this may or may not be the stadium's fault, but I know this venue was not designed for perfect concert sound. It was built for football. But I could not understand half of what Bono said the sound was so bad. And it was so loud my ears rang for two days. - Insane lines for everything. I realize they were near capacity for this event, but lines for the bathrooms, food, booze, everything were ridiculously long.  I understand that Cards games are much more organized. I may still go to a game someday. However, I will NEVER attend a concert here again.

The Roosevelt is a welcome change to the packed, loud, and generic Scottsdale-type bar. They have an amazing beer selection and the location is quaint and charming.  Things I like about The Roosevelt: - The beer selection - Parking is easy (except on First Fridays) - The wait staff is quick - The snack food (yes, the pretzel!) is yummy  Things I do not like about The Roosevelt: - The seating/layout. Because the place is pretty popular, it's nearly impossible to walk in there after dark and find a place to sit. I know the house is small, but I don't think the seating was planned to maximize the space. In the future I might think twice before going to The Roosevelt, just so I don't have to worry if we are going to end up standing in the middle of the house (and in the servers' way) because we cannot find a place to sit or mingle. - There is a beautiful outside deck and no seating out there. In fact, you are not allowed to take your drink out there. I am sure it's some alcohol/zoning thing that they have zero control of, but it would be nice to sit out there.  Side Note: The last time I was there a security guard (or was it an actual police officer?) was standing in the back, stopping people from taking drinks outside. I totally understand that they need to regulate that situation and the guard/cop was VERY nice, but it was still a little odd to have him standing in the middle of the restaurant.   In conclusion, I really like the Roosevelt, but I think they need to re-think the seating.

I had high hopes for Wicked. All the product choices on their website got me excited. I also love supporting local businesses so I decided to give it a shot this weekend.  On my first attempt to visit I decided to call ahead to verify that they were open so I could swing by on my way home from work. I called on a Friday at 1:30 p.m. and the phone rang and rang. After three phone call attempts, I assumed they were closed. Weird.  Saturday morning I decided to try again. Went to the website this time and noticed they didn't open until 10 a.m. A bakery that isn't open early in the morning? Ok. No biggie. I go around 11 a.m.  Like many other reviews noted, the place is tiny. Slade was there and very nice. However, I was taken aback by the lack of selection. He had four muffin choices, a few croissants, and three (maybe four) cupcake choices. From the looks of the website, I assumed there would be cookies, cakes, etc. Not a big deal, I really only wanted muffins and cupcakes anyway. I bought a lemon poppy seed and chocolate muffin, as well as a red velvet and vanilla creme brulee cupcake.  The muffins were ok. Nothing special. The lemon poppy seed was also kind of dry. Again, no biggie, I knew the cupcakes were what it was all about anyway.  I actually really enjoyed the look of the cupcakes. I liked the way the frosting was applied and the fact he used parchment paper instead of muffin cups. However, the red velvet cupcake was also just ok.   The frosting was good, the cake was a little dry. BOO. I haven't even bothered to try the vanilla cream brulee cupcake yet. Maybe my hopes were just too high.  I have read most of the other reviews and it's clear with Wicked there are some inconsistencies. Maybe I just went on a bad day. Not sure if it's worth it to try again though.

I have been to Fuchsia four times, all for facial treatments (no massage). The first time was a few years ago, and my treatment was pretty standard. I decided they were too far away from my home and left it at that.  But recently I decided to try microdermo and did some research. Not only was Fuchsia's price one of the most reasonable in town, they used the diamond system, so I decided to return.  First visit - HEAVY sell on the membership even before my treatment, which I understand and expect but it gets really old. My treatment goes well, although I am a little upset they do zero extractions during a microdermo facial, apparently. Heavy sell again on the membership again when I checkout. I opt to buy a special 3 treatments for $150 card. 15 minutes later I get a phone call asking if I can return to the store. They apparently gave me the wrong card. I tell them I am already two far away. I was slightly shocked they would ask me to return to correct their mistake. Oh well.   Second visit - The air conditioner is not working. IN JULY. It's not horrible, but it is unpleasant enough that they opt to keep the door open while I get my treatment, which I find slightly strange and not very relaxing. I wish they had called me and asked to re-schedule. When I check out this time I receive the big sell on products. Again, I expect this, but it's still annoying. The products I am shown are very expensive ($65 mask, for example) and I politely decline. No samples are offered. I leave feeling and looking like I have a sunburn and still look that way the next day. I figure it must be working and this is normal.   Third visit - Explain the sunburn feeling from the second visit and am told this is normal because they have "gone up" on my microdermo handle/wand/tool thing. At checkout another sell on the membership because now I am out of treatments on the card I had purchased. I tell them I will think about. I then got a sell on product, but this time they offered samples. I happily take my product sample and the membership brochure and am on my merry way. However, now I am worried that my treatment was either bad the 1st and 3rd time, or bad the 2nd time, because I do not feel or look sunburned. So which time(s) did I get ripped off?  The front office ladies (possibly also the owners?) are very friendly and nice and seem to know members names, etc. However, they are always a bit disorganized (making appointments over the phone is always a little taxing) and heavy on sell of memberships, extra treatments, products, sparkly things they sell in the store. And frankly, I don't blame them. They want to make money!   Bottom line - I don't think my treatments were consistent and they are too far away from me, so I am not sure I will return. If you are interested in a membership (at least 12 months) and you find a good person there who you can trust, it's probably a great deal. I, however, will probably continue my search.

The husband and wife that appears to run/own this nail shop are absolutely lovely. However, their children use the salon as their personal playground, and during my pedicure I was treated to their 5 year old begging in his mother's ear for food, toys, attention, etc. It was not a relaxing environment and I feel like my appointment took so much longer than it should have because they were both constantly tending to their children.  24 hours after my appointment was complete I had three chipped nails. In comparison, I went somewhere else to get the polish fixed and went chip-free for six days. I will not be going back to Music Nails.

This place is always extremely crowded with people and merchandise, especially during the Halloween season. Most of the temp help is around 15 years old (and lack basic customer service skills), and the store is dark, dirty and disorganized. I hate going to this store.  I put my feelings aside yesterday because they had a Halloween costume I really wanted. Actually, I THOUGHT they had the costume I wanted, since I called them, they said they had it, and allegedly they put it on hold for me. However, when I arrived the costume was nowhere to be found and they had no extras. After waiting over 10 minutes to talk to a manager, I was offered no apology, no explanation and only the option of checking other stores inventory. After spending another 20 minutes of my life while the manager called two more stores (none of which had my costume) I left empty handed and irritated.  From now on I will go to great lengths of inconvenience to never set foot in this store again.

I love this grocery store. Nice, friendly staff and a large selection of everything. Three things to note: 1. The beer section is fabulous. They stock my favorite beer from the midwest and I swear I am the only person who ever buys it there. 2. Their made-to-order cakes are fantastic. Go for a lemon filling. So amazing! 3. Bonus having an attached Blockbuster, just in case you are in between Netflix discs.  I have a had a few problems at this store (like the time the bag boy turned my custom birthday cake on its side to get it in a bag!) but they have made up for it every time with their stellar customer service.

Completely unimpressed with this place, and I tried it twice.  The first time I went in there I was barely pregnant and I thought it would be a great starting point for seeing what prices were like. No one ever acknowledged my existence the whole time I was there and their prices were so high I almost left the place in tears because I was scared I would not be able to afford anything. I chalked it up to hormones and decided I would give it another try again at a later time.  I tried again recently, as I now have stuff to sell and a few things to buy in the clothing department. I walked in and was told everyone came in at once to sell and that I would either need to wait 20 minutes or leave the items. I said I would leave the items and that seemed to cause a problem because then the manager(?) asked someone else to look through my items immediately (again, I was told 20 minutes or leave) but with a bit of an attitude.   I got the impression they did not want me to watch them go through the items, so I wandered and noticed the prices. Especially now that I know what everything costs, the prices are INSANE. The toys, when on sale at a place like Target, are cheaper. The equipment is way overpriced and looks so used. $26 for a bumbo? They are $36 brand new with coupon at Buy Buy Baby.  The clothes, when on sale at their respective stores, are also the same price or cheaper. I stopped shopping because the prices were so bad and I wandered back up front.  That is is where I found a teenager going through my clothing. I asked what the process was and she said she wasn't done so I took that as my hint to wander again. I then returned and asked if she was finished, as she was now fixing bows in another department. She told me they could offer me $8. However, I had to ask what they took and why. I then asked what they were offering for each item and got no answer, again just a total. I am still not exactly sure what items they took, but in the end I think I averaged about $1 per piece. Interesting, considering how high their prices are for everything. There is no way they even gave me 30% of their price.  Don't misunderstand me, I understand they do not have to take my stuff and I am not offended at all. I was just unimpressed with the process. When you go to other resale places the process is clear: 1. Stay with your stuff or drop at your own risk. First come, first served. 2. If you stay, they usually explain why they pass on a piece. If they take it, they offer the price. You can say yay or nay, even negotiate. 3. The ticket is handed to you to take to the register. 4. You get your cash or credit and bounce.  Not hard, folks.   And, may I add that although I love teenagers (I truly do) how exactly are they qualified to judge brands, quality, etc. of baby/children's items if they have not had their own child and/or extensive training? My guess is they pass on items all the time because the teens have no idea what they are looking at or what something is.  In conclusion, I will not give this place a third chance. You are much better off giving your items to charity for a family that needs a bargain, rather than a business overcharging their customers.

My first experience to Tavern on Mill included ASU co-eds in tube tops dancing to Kanye West, so when a friend suggested we go there to watch a football game and get some food, I was skeptical. I had no idea that on weekdays and during the day on weekends it is an actual restaurant.   Anyway, the service started slow but we moved tables and things picked up. My friends all took advantage of a Wednesday night happy hour special that included a beer and a shot for $5. We all sampled various appetizer including the tater tots, cheese curls, chicken fingers, and nachos. Everything looked good, smelled good, but the taste was sub par, even for bar food.  It was also hard to enjoy watching the football and basketball game there. The tvs are on but so is the music.   The only upside was our bill. We were there for at least 2.5 hours and ordered lots of drinks and several appetizers, and yet our bill was VERY reasonable.  Whether people are dancing on the tables or eating on them, either way I would rather not return to Tavern on Mill.

What is the deal with CVS? They are consistently inconsistent. There are times I find what I need and get checked out in a reasonable amount of time. But for every one time that happens, the nine other times I cannot find what I want (or they are out of it) and the cashier seems to be moving at the speed of turtle. The only reason I keep going is the convenient location and the fact that occasionally they have amazing deals.

In search of the perfect, cheap pizza we recently picked up a $6 large pepperoni from PM. Our expectations were low, so we were pleasantly surprised to find the pizza was a nice size and the ingredients appeared to be good quality. Although I thought the crust was a bit thin, overall the taste was pretty good.  This is not pizza to get excited about at all. Oh, and did I mention you have to cook it yourself? But it you were having a ton of people over and wanted to save some money, this would be a great cost saver and most people would think it was delivery. And it is way better than frozen pizza any day.

I am posting an update for two reasons: 1. Their customer service is great. 2. With coupons and special offers, we are able to receive a large pepperoni pizza and a container of cookie dough for $5.06 with tax. You cannot beat that.  Still not my favorite pizza, but I throw a little oregano on it and it's pretty good!

I can't believe I have not reviewed Gymboree! We have been attending classes here for over a year, and my child looks forward to them each and every week. The staff is seasoned and knows how to include all the children (shy, rambunctiousetc.) in a positive and safe environment. The recent remodel of the facility is also nice.  My only con would be some of the parents. Just like in any situation with families, some parents just don't get it. I have seen parents use it as social hour and not participate at all. I have also seen some parents watch as their child takes a toy from another child, knock another child down, etc. and do nothing. SIGH.

Spicy Pickle is easy and cheap (sandwiches are currently only $5 after 5 p.m.).   A few things bug me about this place though: - They close early. 8 p.m.? Really?  - If you go after the lunch rush they will be out of the soups you desperately want and need. - If you go after the lunch rush on Mondays they will be out of free cookies they promise with any sandwich.  Good things: - Pickles are yummy. - The basil mayo is yummy. - The kiddos who work there are very nice.  MEH things: - The sandwiches are ok. Not amazing. Ok. Still better than Subway, Quiznos, etc. - BF thought the panini crust was too hard.  I will try it again. It is a nice departure from the usual fast food.

Solo Cafe offers some of the best coffee and coffee service in the Valley. They are super friendly and their ambiance is also very nice.   Two reasons I cannot give it a five: 1. It is not a fast, in-and-out place. Most of the time there appears to be only one person working. You often have to wait several minutes for your drink. I am usually not in a hurry, so no big deal, but if I was in a hurry Solo would not be a place I would stop.  2. It is often VERY quiet in there. Again, not a real problem. However, it sometimes feels a little like a library, and more than a few times I have been afraid to talk to my friends when sitting on their comfy furniture for fear a nearby computer user would give me the evil eye for disturbing their "work" environment.  Great, independent coffee house. Check them out!

Super cute decor, but I think their prices are a little higher than a normal neighborhood nail place.   Last week I walked in the door at 6:15 p.m. right behind another customer. They took her, but would not take me, since it was apparently "close to closing time" (which happens to be 7 p.m.). I did not argue, even though they took the other woman with no problem, and instead went down the street to another nail place that was happy to take my money.   Unless you want the thrill of the same old mani/pedi with cute IKEA pillows and fun paint colors to look at, you can get the same service elsewhere for less.

My boyfriend is in love with Firehouse so I eat there quite a bit. In terms of quality they blow away Subway, Quiznos, etc. Their subs are also quite large, and the hot sauce collection is amusing. I tried the DBacks hot sauce as a joke, and actually found it to be quite tasty. At the same time, I realized I do like hot sauce on my sandwiches. Who knew? Thanks, Firehouse!  I give them four out of five stars for two reasons: 1. One night they gave me the hard sell on the brownies and I caved. They were not anything special. Don't bother. 2. The last time I was there they took way too long to make one sub and there were six people working behind the counter. In addition, two people that ordered after me got their food first. That is seriously irritating.   Definitely a nice alternative to other sandwich chains.

Their gyros are now a staple in our takeout dinner rotation and their fries are amazing. The meat is super tender and has incredible flavor.  The owner is always extremely friendly and really wants his customers to have the best experience possible. Last time I was there he talked us into buying some Greek beers. They were good, but they were $4.50 a piece. Next time I will stick with just a gyro and fries.  Try them. You will not be sorry.

I really like this museum. We took out niece when she was five and she loved it. We now take our daughter and even though she is just a baby the room on the 3rd floor is a perfect place for her to explore.  Try to go on days when they have special events in The Junior League of Phoenix room, etc. as that will make the trip even more special.  My only feedback would be that the museum is a bit expensive. However, they do have free events/days and reasonably priced memberships.

I have only been there one time. I got a $10 manicure during one of their promotions. It was the longest and sloppiest manicure of my life. However, the young woman who worked on my manicure was very nice and they do use quality products. I would not return, but you can't beat their prices, especially during promotions.  UPDATE: Kohler sent an e-mail after I posted this review offering me a free manicure. While I appreciate the offer, I declined. I did want to share with all of you that although I did not have the best experience, they definitely tried to correct the situation.

Some time had gone by since my last visit to Kohler and I felt like giving it another chance. A Groupon was available so I purchased the deal and headed back to Kohler with a friend who goes there regularly and we spent the morning getting a facial and a manicure.  The facial - I get facials often at other places and know the general routine. The tech was sweet but she did not explain what she was doing to me, ask me questions, recommend products, etc. There also was really no privacy for taking off/putting on clothes, etc other than a sheer curtain that did not cover my treatment space. She also did not do extractions even after her instructor told her too. However, in the end I still left feeling clean and moisturized. The next day I woke up and I was broken out all over my face AND my chest. I have never broken out on my chest in my entire life. It has taken almost two weeks for my skin to clear. I have no idea what products they used but clearly it was not right for my skin.   The manicure - Much better this time, but the polish was still way too thick. Three hours later I had three chips and I had done nothing but have a late lunch, do some light shopping, and drive home. The next day the polish looked so bad I had to take it off.  Bottom line - I will never be returning to Kohler again, no matter how great the deal is. You get what you pay for.

Madison Avenue has most definitely upgraded by moving their salon to the much nicer Chandler and 48th Street location. However, I think most of their hair stylists are pretty mediocre, and their prices are high for the quality of cut and color you receive. I have yet find a hair stylist there that was worth the money and have decided to look elsewhere.  On the flip side, if I could give 5 stars to Pearl, who has worked there forever doing waxing and facials, I absolutely would. Her prices are reasonable and my eyebrows are always perfect.   Side note: As a regular customer of almost 6 years, it also irritated me that earlier this year they refused to give me a gift certificate for a non-profit fundraising auction I was organizing. I understand that times are tough, but I am long time customer who has given them several referrals. They need to appreciate and support the community.

I finally checked out Press for the first time last night and was very impressed. The staff was incredibly helpful, the store was laid out well, service was quick, and the patio is a nice hangout.   The staff told my friend that they have the best latte in town. I am a latte freak, so I bit and decided to try it out. Not only was the latte amazing, but they also spent an extra few minutes explaining the latte-making process and then attempted to make some cool shapes with the milk. AWESOME.  I am so, so glad to see a decent coffee place on this side of town. They have a great product and it's great people watching out on the patio. I definitely want to go back with friends and have a glass of wine. Now, if they would only stay open later than 9...

I am afraid to Yelp about Joyful, because I absolutely adore this place and I don't want to become too crowded!  I am a yoga novice and they have been nothing but helpful and encouraging. All the yoga instructors are very nice and each has their own unique teaching style.   I also very much enjoy the Zumba classes. They are crowded but the energy in those classes is electric. You will leave sweaty and energized.  Syd (the owner) is amazing. She knows everyone's name and adds a personal touch to your experience.   I will never be a member of a gym again. I love Joyful!

This CVS drives me BANANAS. First of all, I think CVS is setup to be slow and crappy. One line, one person working who has no idea how to use the register, horribly high non-sale item prices, bad lightening, old school (and not in a good way) layout, etc. That being said, I continue to go there because of it's proximity to my workplace. Basically, I have no choice.   Which brings me to the pharmacy. While I have no one to blame but myself when I go into buy a candy bar and it takes 20 minutes to check out (see paragraph above) I have a higher standard when it comes to the pharmacy. There are literally 10 BILLION people working back there (ok, maybe 6) and yet they cannot get it together. I have literally waited in line inside for 30 minutes with a baby in my arms as snot ran down my blouse (from my nose, not the baby's, I was the sick one) and only one person is working the counter AND the drive thru while 5 other people chat  about their vacation plans (seriously!) and fill prescriptions. I took note of this issue and next time I used the drive thru, as the baby was sleeping and they seem to favor the drive thru to the people waiting inside. When I got to the front they told me my prescription, which had been called in 6 hours prior, was not ready. WTF, CVS? Totally unacceptable. I demanded it immediately and told them I would not move my vehicle until I received my medication. After all, it was a zpack. Grab the box and throw it at me. No "filling" required.  UGH.  I will do almost anything to avoid this CVS.

This has become one of my favorite places to grab a quick coffee on my way to the office. Their pumpkin spice iced coffee is fabulous. And the prices are so much better than Starbucks, etc.  However, the donuts are "meh." I would rather have Krispy Kreme, etc. They do have a croissant sandwich with sausage though that is pretty good.

I am updating my review because even though the coffee is good, the service is really inconsistent. Conversation in the drive thru today: Me: Do you have a special on lattes right now? DD: Ok, so one latte. Me: Are they on special? DD: LAUGHING. SILENCE. LAUGHING. Ya, 99 cents. Me: Ok, I will have one with non fat milk and vanilla syrup. DD: SILENCE. THEN LAUGHING. Ok, latte with splenda. Me: No, latte with nonfat milk and vanilla. DD. Ok boss, anything else? Me: No thank you. DD: Total at the window, boss. DD At Window: That will be $2.63. Me: I thought they were 99 cents. DD: Oh, ya. That will be $1.08. Me: Here is $1.10. DD: Thanks, have a nice day. Me: PAUSE WAITING FOR MY CHANGE. DD: STARES BLANKLY BACK AT ME.  Then, I get to my office and try my coffee and there is no vanilla in it. Awesome.   So, long story short: 1. Professionalism/manners are severely lacking. Also, please do not call me "boss." 2. You tried to overcharge me. 3. You got my order wrong. 4. You did not give me back my change. Granted, it is two cents, but it is still my change.  Even though I still think the coffee is good, I may start heading back to Starbucks.

Maybe it's because it's convenient and easy, but I am going to give Lucky Lou's four stars. Would I drive more than a 10 minutes to eat there? Probably not. However, the service is always good and the food is better than average. I especially enjoy their hamburgers, the caesar salad, and the buffalo chicken sandwich. I have also tried their fried pickles and they are worth the calories. However, I would not bother with the other appetizers unless it is happy hour because they are overpriced and underwhelming.

I have only been there once, but I am a definite fan of Tonic, mainly because the bartenders are stellar. They keep the drinks and food coming, asked for our names (and remembered them) and gave us coupons for free food the next time we return. It's not a destination bar (nothing I would drive across town for) but a nice neighborhood bar.  It's trying hard to be upscale, but the customers are mostly locals of various age groups and backgrounds, in everything from sweatpants to clubbing outfits. I would not worry too much about dressing to impress at Tonic, despite the fact the decor has a very club feel. The night we were there I got the impression that many of the patrons were starting their night there, having a drink and some food, before moving onto Scottsdale or Tempe.  We went later in the evening, after HH, and our bill was more than we usually spend on drinks and food. However, we each had several drinks and we tried three or four appetizers, so the value was good. Next time we will return during HH to save a few bucks.

I am sad that it is always packed because ahwatukee is a wasteland of nothing but chains, so this place is dubbed hip and different, and thus continues to be packed every weekend with soccer moms and their families. As long as it is packed it won't change and it could be great. The service is almost non existent. Be prepared to wait for everything, starting with a hostess the minute you walk in. The last time I ate there I had to go get silver wear and a menu myself. The menu tries hard but doesn't quite make the mark and the prices are high. Finally, beware of the ever changing beer prices in the cooler near the entrance. Signs clearly mark that beers are 6 for $8.95, but some employees charge more for certain beers even though that are not marked as such. After spending my Father's Day morning trying to make a special six pack for my husband and getting denied even though signs are everywhere and they had not pulled these shenanigans for the same beers before, I will not be returning. The McDonalds in the parking lot would be better food and service.

I am here at least once a week for something. It is organized, the staff is helpful, and you can use your Bed Bath and Beyond coupons there. Their return policy is liberal and they make registering very simple. I like this place 1,000 better than Babies R Us.   Also, Shooting Stars is fabulous! We purchased a package right after our child was born and we take her there monthly as part of the package we purchased at no charge!

This place has me hooked! I will take their yogurt over Mojo and the pinkberry knockoffs any day. Cute decor, nice service, and AMAZING flavors. The red velvet is a must. The peanut butter is also fantastic. This place has already become a big hangout in Ahwatukee. They are open late too! Love zoyo!

I had zero expectations for The Ostrich Festival. This festival delivered beyond my wildest dreams.  Parking - easy, $5, volunteers were super helpful and walked me to a premier parking spot right in front of the entrance. I came back later in the night and told them I had already paid earlier in the day, and once again they led me to an awesome parking spot at no additional charge.  Admission - $10. Their was a groupon and I wished we had purchased it, but I think $10 is fair. They take credit card.  Beer - $5 for 12 oz. shock tops. For a festival of this nature, I consider that quite a bargain. And thank god we were not all stuck with bud and bud light.  Entertainment - extremely interesting but also extremely crowded. You can still see the ostrich, emu, and camel races above all the tall folks in front of you though. Pig races were impossible to see.   Food - Like the state fair, but cheaper and better with more choices. They had ostrich burgers, although I did not have one.   Carnival - they had the normal amusement park games and rides. We did not partake but the lines seemed short.  Music - With the cost of admission we got entrance into an Eddie Money concert, FTW! He sounded great and the joint was packed. Totally fun and totally worth going back for in the evening.  People watching - not as hick as I expected, but still it was fun to just sit around and watch the attendees.  We will definitely be back next year. Thank you, Ostrich Festival!

The yogurt is average but it is convenient and so I have returned multiple times. However, this place has some of the worst customer service I have ever seen. I have witnessed employees leisurely sitting with their friends at a table while customers wait to check out, I have had to yell to the back of the store to let the employees know I was there and was ready to check out because they were too busy talking on the phone in the stock room, and I have had to watch my yogurt melt because the employees are so slow the line gets backed up and I have to wait several minutes to pay.  I found another yogurt place in the neighborhood. It is a little farther away but I would rather drive a few extra minutes then give this place my business.

Love this place. Clean and welcoming facility, front staff is helpful, and the instructors are top notch. I have been thoroughly impressed with their baby swimming program, and IT'S FREE until they are 6 months old.   The facility can be a bit tricky to locate. Basically find Toby Keith's bar and grill on the far north side of Mesa Riverview and go east in the parking lot. You will see it on your right.  I have heard some of the other Hubbard facilities are not that nice, and I have also heard about issues with instructors at other locations, but again, I have had zero problems at Mesa Riverview.  The only drawback - the cost is about $80 a month for a swim lessons once a week for 30 minutes. That seems high, but the kids can learn to swim year round, inside, in a heated pool.

Hey, it's Baskin Robbins. No gimmicks, it's not hip, but the ice cream is excellent and the prices are ok. FYI: They are now offering specials on yelp and on foursquare for checking in!

Disney does so much dead on, perfect, right it's ridiculous. The stores are no exception. This store is so much better than Arizona Mills location. Employees are very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. We love the viewing area with a jukebox type machine where my child can choose the store's music selection. Little touches of magic are nice and could possibly distract you from the prices for the costumes. Check the back left for clearance.

This place is a total dump.   Went on a Tuesday night and were seated in a completely empty restaurant area at a dirty, uncomfortable table in the dark. So dark I could not read the menu. The entertainment that evening was a cover band playing "Hello" by Lionel Richie and it was not a so-bad-it's-good band, but awful, out of tune, hurts your ears band. While we read the menu another family came in and I overheard their server explain that they were out of several items on the menu. Wish our server had provided that info. Our server arrived and my husband asked about an item he read about on their website that was not on the menu. After checking with the kitchen, he said they would make it special for him but normally that is not a menu item. WTF? I never walk out of restaurants without ordering but I had to bail. I just had a feeling it could only get worse. Wish I had read the reviews here first.

It's all about the beer selection here, period. The food is mediocre bar food. But the atmosphere is lively, the service is decent, and the beer is outstanding. Get there early on a night or weekend or be prepared to wait.

Really wanted to like this place, but after three visits we are not fans.  - Location is clean and the employees are nice but not necessarily helpful. - Burgers are a higher quality for fast food but on the expensive side. - Fries are super greasy. - Cheese curds are nasty. - Custard is not much better than a dairy queen soft serve quality.  Every time we ate here, we felt like crap afterwards. So many better, cheaper fast food options.

I hate this location.  I am still bitter that the Ahwatukee store closed. Always good service. Always well stocked. Easy in and out. Why or why?  But here is why I hate the Old Navy (Outlet??): - How is it an outlet? Basically a regular Old Navy. Same prices and HORRIBLE clearance sections. Regular Old Navy stores have way better bargains in the clearance area. - No one appears to work there, except the one cashier helping the 15 people waiting in line. And he/she appears to be on day 2 and still training.  - Stuff is everywhere. Same shorts in three different places in store. WTW? - Re-stocking appears to be a low priority. They rarely have the size I need.  At this point, I only go in there to return items I bought online and do not want. And that process takes no less 20 minutes. This store clearly does not value customer's time.

We used to go here when it was BoomBozz because we liked the food and beer selection but the service was terrible, especially towards the end. We decided to try it again now that it has changed names and owners. Beer selection is still pretty good, but the service is still pretty bad and the food is "meh" at best.  We walked in, were seated immediately, and then told our server was missing. Not a problem we thought, someone else took our drink order, and then never returned. Several minutes later a man I saw smoking in the parking lot when we drove in came to the table and announced he would be taking our order. Glad he got his smoke break in while we waited with children on a busy Saturday night. Awesome.  From there the service was REALLY SLOW and at times non-existent. When the food came the order was wrong for my daughter but they did quickly fix it which I really appreciated. I can't say much else about the food except that it was just bland. Mac and cheese was bland. Pizza was bland. Everything bland. So much potential. I mean, it is all basically comfort food, and there was nothing special there at all.   There are so many other places in the area with a better beer selection and much better food and service. We will probably not be back.

Musicology has been instrumental in my daughter's development since she was 6 months old. She loves the music and activities. The instructors are knowledgeable in early childhood education and have a wonderful, happy demeanor. We have incorporated several music toys at home that she fell in love with at Musicology. We also use one of the "pick up the instruments" songs when we pick up our toys at home.   One thing to know - the parents are expected to actively participate in the classes with their children. It's not social hour for the moms, and I think that is super cool.   Worth the investment to participate in a fun, parent-child activity with instructors who know their stuff.

We were excited for this place to open and we left pretty impressed, especially since they just opened.   Pros - Beer selection is what you come here for - period. They let us try anything, which was amazing. All the other tap rooms usually charge for tastes. The food menu is limited, but the prime rib sandwich at the pretzels were both good. The pizza, with pretzel crust, was so-so. Wait staff was delightful, owner was nice. We sat outside which was lovely.   Cons - The inside is mostly high tables. I prefer low. It is also on the small side, so I would be worried to try to meet here with a large group.   We will be back!

We held the youngest class Carole has ever conducted, and the party went off beautifully. Both the parents and kids loved every second. And the cost, for all you receive, is completely reasonable. I can't thank Party with Paint enough. I will be back for an adult night soon!

Such a disappointment. Just drove across town to enjoy this place. Called ahead and was told 45 minute wait. Got here 40 minutes later and there are probably a dozen parties still ahead of mine. So many waiting they could not even tell me how much longer it would be. Bar was so busy we couldn't get close to have a drink and wait. Nice staff but they should have been more realistic with wait time. Also really small and loud. Will probably try again another time but only on a deader day.
