Save your money and avoid this place!  For $15.24, I ordered the two meat platter with the beef brisket and pulled pork, which was lacking a side dish and some of the beef brisket that was very dry. The pulled pork was delicious and the down low barbecue sauce was very good, but that's about all that was good about this meal. I got my order to go and gave them a call once I got home and realized that it was missing a good portion of the meal. Was extremely disappointed! The lady that I spoke with told me to come in at my convenience and she would give me a compt'd meat platter. When I went to collect, a very rude guy told me that he had no idea what I was talking about and that they could not help me. This place is absolutely ridiculous and I would never recommend this to anyone! Very over priced bbq with horrible customer service!
