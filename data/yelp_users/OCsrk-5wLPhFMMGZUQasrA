I've been coming here my whole life and now the prices are too high and the portions are smaller. *frowny face*

This place is better than all the 'Bertos & Salsitas combined, especially when hammered at 1am. It's f-ing amazing. You might crap your pants afterward due to the massive size of their burritos but it would be worth it. So don your adult diapers and go to town!

Ethiopian is so tasty, especially at Lalibela. Blue Nile is good but Lalibela is better taste-wise. Great prices too.

This is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Tempe/Mesa area. Its the tastiest and has the best prices. The lunch buffet is the best too.

I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box. The tables are folding tables, like the kind you play beer pong on. And they have pictures of kids and babies on the walls and signs asking people to send in pictures of their kids for the walls too, which has nothing to do with Asian/Mexican cuisine, it creeped me out.

The food here is amazing. The atmosphere is nice too, when you sit at the counter you can watch them cook. Its the best place to go in the winter too. Nice cold beer and a hot pasty. *drool*

Woah woah, this place is closed? Wth?? This drive-in was awesome. And pretty packed on the weekends too, how could the overhead be high enough to shut down. It was only a dirt lot with crappy old screens. They probably made the rent selling popcorn alone. I hope someone buys and reopens it. It was awesome for date nights during Fall. I'm still surprised it's closed, it doesn't make any sense to me. Lame.

When I called to ask the hours the owner snapped and said "Who is this?!". When I showed up she made us sit in the parking lot in July while she locked up her dog. Then proceeded to tell us that she was gonna kick us out after I told her I was just browsing. Then she told me I would be the last customer ever because she's closing down to turn it into a B-movie screening theater due to people like me who just browse and waste her time. According to another review she said the same thing to someone else over a year ago. My boyfriend asked if her new business would be friendlier (lol) and she said "No, in fact worse.". Horrible customer service, horribly disorganize, no wares of interest, smelled like dog and mothballs, and the owner is rude & insane.

Flo's is the bomb-diggity. My family has known Flo since she was the cook at Eddie Chan's in Scottsdale. I loved that little hole in the wall Chinese restaurant and was sad when they closed and reopened in Cave Creek as an expensive up-scale place. But Flo's is still affordable. The portion sizes are good (I can't even eat a whole kids order of sweet & sour chicken) and they now have steamed bbq pork buns *drool*. The atmosphere is a little nerve-racking though. Maybe it's the bare floors and high ceilings but it always seems loud and chaotic there.

What to say about 92nd St Cafe? Well, it's kind of crappy but at the same time it's kind of not. I mean, the furniture is nice and they're remodeling the bathrooms. But the layout is so bizarre and there's so many beer ads, posters, neon signs, & pennants that it makes all the nice stuff irrelevant. The shape of the bar is weird too and there's not much room to move around when it's busy. The karaoke has a new guy that's cool, right now it's my favorite place to Karaoke. The staff is friendly and they remember customers. After only two visits the waiter remembered my favorite drink. The food is pretty good quality but their menu is a crazy clusterf*ck of different kinds of food. Nachos, fried shrimp, linguine bolognese, omelettes?  All in all this place is a cozy neighborhood bar that's fun to have a few drinks at.

Best homemade cookies ever! They're all thin and slightly doughy. Whenever I have one I pee my pants a little cause they're that good. THAT GOOD! The fact that more "popular" ice cream franchises directly next door to it have come and gone over the years while this place remains should give you a good idea of how yummy these cookie sandwiches are.

I've taken about 2 classes a day, 4 days a week, all summer long and I've already lost 25lbs. It's alot of fun here, I wouldn't call this a professional dance studio where you'll end up the next Fred Astaire but for entry level dancers or people who hate the gym it's great. They even have yoga classes and so far this is the cheapest yoga I've found in the entire valley.

No one answers the phone when I call and I can't find an email address on their website.  I need to cancel my membership and here is why;  "Magic Mike" was incredibly rude to my mother and told her she couldn't have the student discount because he didn't believe she was a college student. Even after she showed him her student ID he said "Ok...but I don't buy it." Why? Because she's an older woman? Since when is there an age limit for college students? That's blatant discrimination! How dare they treat their paying customers like that! I've been going to Abby Bella on and off since 2010 but this incident ends my relationship with their business here and now. I'm appalled at how they treated someone that I now regret referring to their business. Since I can't get ahold of anyone there and their website won't let me remove my credit card without first agreeing to a vague and poorly written contract, I now have no choice but to stop payment with my bank.   Not to mention the quality of teachers and class options has gone downhill over the years.  Many of the teachers single students out and make rude or embarrassing comments to humiliate you if you're too good or not good enough. Plus there's random dogs running around the studio during class when pet allergies and phobias are a common thing! I will never recommend this place to anyone again.

The food is great but its a little pricey for a poor college student like me. The food is really awesome though so I suppose it's worth it. It's also a great place for a nice little romantic date. Out of all the Indian restaurants I've been to in the valley this one has the nicest atmosphere. I especially like to browse the little Indian market next door when I've finished eating.

I'm not the biggest fan of Paradise Bakery. Only because it's so busy when I go in there around meal times. However if you get there really early in the morning it's empty and everything is fresh and warm. The employees are really nice people. In fact I came in and bought the chocolate babka so often that on their last day of serving it (it was seasonal) the manager David gave me a whole babka cake on the house! So rad.

This is my favorite restaurant/bar in town. The pasties are AMAZING and the beer choices are awesome, not mention decently priced (though together you should expect to spend about $40 for two people). The Chandler location is the only place I've ever found with Franziskaner Hefeweissen on tap!

Good happy hour prices, fancy yummy food, and an awesome patio bar. Robbie Fox himself is there sometimes and he is a delightful, foul mouthed, Irish man whom I wouldn't mind making babies with. He even serenaded my table with everyone's holiday favorite "Merry F*cking Christmas". I also river danced for the whole bar and they were a lively group. Saw some old ladies doing the electric slide. Fun for the whole family...(except kids probably)

Really really laid back. Order at the counter and sit at a picnic table. The portions were huge, the prices weren't bad at all, and the bbq was reeeally good. They even sell old school candies. When the weather is nice they open these garage door like windows and it turns the whole restaurant into an outdoor patio practically. It's rad. I came here on my birthday and I thought it was awesome, I think people are missing the point of this restaurant being simple and not fancy. The drink prices need to be lowered however, $4 for a pint of Budweiser is just silly.

I went in with serious pain in my shoulder blades and they gave me the best deep tissue massage I have ever had. I'm going to keep rebooking for sure.
