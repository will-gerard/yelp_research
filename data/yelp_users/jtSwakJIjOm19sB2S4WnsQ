Love this place!  I go pretty much every Wednesday to listen to Paul Knight play/sing. Great atmosphere, great people, love the chai and mocco (sp?) cocoa latte (both hot and cold), and of course love the fact that it's all for a good cause. They also sale crafts and other things to help raise money for NATN.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed.

I booked my daughters first birthday here.  We were promised in the $164 we paid a month prior, 10 free tickets for day of, a entertainer for 1 hour, party favors for the kids, and a free year membership for the birthday girl.  We were supposed to be there at 3:00 for the party to be at 330.  The party before us ran over, pushing our set up time to past the party start time.  Our guests had to wait out in the mall for almost a hour.  They gave us extra time at the end, which we didn't even use. We didn't have an entertainer, the guy that was supposed to be doing it was only there for a max of 10 min. No party favors, glad I made my own. No membership at all.  Then they wanted to charge me $170+ for the 10 people who were already part of the $164 plus the additional people who came to the party but didn't actually go through the aquarium or paid already. I for sure won't be going back for another party or to visit the aquarium, which is a shame cause my daughter loves watching the fish.

Review update! Glad that I was able to talk to Cherilynn and find out that I am still within the delivery area.  We had pizza and fried zucchini last night and yum yum. The slices are huge, the zucchini was amazing, I should have got two orders for my family of four cause they were just that good and they are good sized too.  Shelly was friendly and chit chatted with us while we were waiting for our order. For sure sticking with these guys and probably will be going in to visit to try some other things out on the menu.  If they had TVs we would be there every Sunday for football!
