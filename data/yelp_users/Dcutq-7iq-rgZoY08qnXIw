If it wasn't for the waitress I would give the experience a one.  The food was not hot- even after sending it back the 2nd time.  I ordered onion soup- and the first time it was luke warm...the 2nd time...not even that...then the french dip was delivered with cold aus juice.  The waitress was exceptional.  She was actually a new waitress and very very good.  If this establishment doesn't get their back end up to par, this waitress will find herself at another establishment, probable the competition and I have no doubts doing very well for herself.  She was on top of everything. Even when the "manager" took off the wrong meal she caught it.  She was there for the refills on drinks and if it wasn't for her, we would have walked away.    I've been to Mimi's many times and the last 4 or 5 at this location the food has been a "C".  The service usually an "A" or "B".  Management needs to come across a little more sincere too with their apologies.

Mimi's not sure if you have been listening...  On another trip to Mimi's (had a coupon) decided to try it again...  New Years Day...it was busy- we decided to sit outside- no wait.  We were waited by the manager Aaron as they were so busy and unfortunately some of their staff called in sick...  anyway...  he was extremely attentive and more importantly the food was prepared exactly correctly.  Good job Mimi's! and Aaron!!!

On a recent visit to Outback on a Wednesday evening so you know they were not that busy we were greeted by the hostess (very friendly and nice)...unfortunately went down hill from there....  when the waiter asked us what we wanted to drink it was 5 waters and an ice tea- he was literally annoyed that we were not ordering drinks....  took our order and 3 of the 5 meals were wrong...ok they got two meals right...and when they had to bring my salad out twice because they do not know what seared means for tuna- first time it was raw and it was obvious it was not seared- the second time it was butchered over well done...the manager came up...apologized and said we're not going to charge you for this (really- like I would pay for it anyway).  Never offered to fix me something else but did offer dessert.....  With so many choices out there I'm really surprised this quality of service and food preparation continues...  it will be the last time I set foot into this Outback Steakhouse again along with the 5 other people that were with me...  very bad service, food and the oh well attitude was noticed.  Charlestons and Carrabbas is in the same complex...  hello C's

The service level of Nordstrom's never ceases to amaze me. On a recent visit to ladies clothes I found a really cute dress that I didn't notice until I got home had a flaw in it- brought it back...the Assistant Manager, Alex Bixler was nothing short of amazing.  She called 7 different stores while I waited to find one that was not flawed.  I would highly recommend this person to assist anyone looking for clothes.  I heard her helping others too.  She is professional, knows the lines and is honest.  I will be making sure I shop when she works and would recommend her for anyone looking for someone to assist them to ask for Alex.

Horrible Experience!  Waiter lacked manners and was more interested in getting a date with the table next door then he was to making sure other tables were taken care of. Went there Monday evening for my boyfriends birthday.  Been there before but never had this bad of service.  Issue with the food, but that wasn't the issue...while trying to share with the waiter what the problem was..he walked away...and manager when she showed up...didn't listen either...guess they're too busy to want repeat business....won't be giving them my monies in the future...issues happen but how they are dealt with is what matters.  Very disappointed with the waiter and manager's attention.  The only person that seemed to care was the kitchen manager and it wasn't her fault.  Guess this chain thinks that people skills are not important -  Update-  the manager finally called me 3 days later...we spoke briefly-  during that conversation he was going to check into whether the server noted about the allergies...  week later and I'm still waiting for that phone call back from the manager...  He was so quick to defend the lousy service and issue with the meal that he has not contacted me back....  kept apologizing but did NOTHING TO MAKE IT RIGHT!

I just got my vehicle back from the Car Shop.  I have been taking it there for years.  The technician always communicates to me about my vehicle and the staff is always friendly, helpful (explaining to me what needs to be done on my vehicle) and the owner is amazing.  He dropped what he was doing to take me back to work when I had told them I would wait but something came up.  I can't say enough good things about this place.    I have referred a number of my clients here and some have traveled as far as Gilbert and the West side for the type of professionalism and service they have gotten here.  Pricing is always good.  If there were 10 stars they would get that!

Usually I go to the Firebirds in Chandler but was on the west side.  I have to say the service was as wonderful as it is in Chandler and the food was equally as good.  I had the strawberry and shrimp salad.  The cook was a little to heavy on the pepper on the shrimp for me but everything was fresh, abundant and good.  Service was exceptional.  The other meals were the ribs and filet.  Everyone's meal was great...only wish the fireplace was positioned in the eating area and not the bar!

Went there on Sunday-  New Years Day...  they were busy but not that busy-  It took 20 minutes for the food to come out the first time-  cold...then 15 more minutes the 2nd time...but they got my meal wrong...they re-made it the 3rd time and it was still wrong....  made it 4 times...it's been an hour and 10 minutes...I ate it;....but it was still wrong...  you'd think I ordered something special....  hamburger without maynoise protein style cooked medium...they couldn't get it right...every time came out beyond well done...  not sure how many time the manager said I'm sorry and finally the 4th time said...maybe we need to check the grill...you think????  I bet most people would deal with it and just not go back....  If I'm paying for something I want it right and the way I want it....   I get mistakes happen...but 4 times...  they need to get their $#&%*)&%@  together or they'll find everyone going to the other Red Robins where you get what you order.

Went to Charleston's last evening and had an amazing dining experience.  The food is consistently good, the service was great and even though there were small kitchen hicupps the waiter and manager more than made up for them.  If you have not tried their Chicken Piccata you need to.  It is tangy and lemony and the capers and artichoke hearts make it amazings good!    I would highly recommend this location and like usual- they did not disappoint.

Joe the manager is awesome!  When I first went there last month I purchased a thinkpad twist, it had issues and has since been recalled.  The staff was helpful and completely understanding with my frustration.  They made sure I got into another product that would be the best solution for my business.  Everyone was great in getting me back and running and extremely patient with me.  They walked me thru and transferred all my data now I'm back there every week for the training.  Their technical support and trainers are great. A huge Thank you to Adam!  My favorites for training are Gary, Melissa and Alma they spend time with you and let you do it yourself which is how I learn.  From the moment you walk in to the minute you leave you're treated with respect, communication and a cold beverage.  I only wish they offered wine along with their water and soda's :-)  I would highly recommend The Scottsdale Microsoft Store to anyone looking to purchase a windows product.  They will answer your questions and help you make the best decision for you.  Debbie Nieman Realtor

This company does not return calls and does not pick up the dumpster when you order it picked up!  My client called the company to have a dumpster delivered and requested a pick up 3 days later, it was confirmed and yet never picked up.  As their agent who's attempting to get the property on the market I called on my clients behalf 3 times in one day requesting a call back, giving the property address, my phone number and the day (three days prior) when it was supposed to be picked up.  They never called me back.  They never called my client and looks like I'll be driving out there again tomorrow to see if they did their job.  If you're looking for a reliable company to deliver a dumpster and pick it up- DO NOT CALL Team Clean and Haul- they do not deliver what they say.  T

If you're looking for a local amazing restaurant to support- you need to check out the Perfect Pear Bistro.  The minute you step into the quaint establishment you are greeted with friendly people, soft music and an atmosphere that invites conversation and great fresh food.  Whether you're looking for a sandwich or salad or pasta, the food is fresh and good.  No TV's at this establishment- you actually get to converse with the person you're sharing a meal with.  The owner stopped by the table and genuinely wanting to know about our experience.  Even if you don't like in ahwatukee- it's worth the drive.  Let them know Debbie sent you.

Went there this evening with some clients/friends and wasn't sure what to expect when you drive up...you almost feel like you're going thru an alley on Wall Street in Chandler...the perch was everything you would not expect.  The greetings by the birds was followed with a very friendly hostess and sitting outside with the misters was actually pleasant and it was over 100 outside.  The food was great- different and the atmosphere was different, fun and exciting.  I will definitely be back and expect my next client appreciation to be at the Perch.  Fun place to go- if you bring your kids (of all ages) watch your fingers around the birds- they do bite!

I've been coming to the perch for over a year now with friends and clients.  Being a sunday evening I was not expecting it to be extremely crowded and I was correct yet it took over an hour for a table of 5 to get their food.  When asking the waiter we were told the kitchen had limited people working that night....if you're going to be open for dinner- be staffed correctly.  I will be thinking twice before coming to the Perch again...very disappointed.
