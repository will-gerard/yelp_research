Chips were great, enchiladas were great, and the ladies loved the margaritas! It's got a fun atmosphere and excellent service, will definitely go again! It is a little hard to find tucked behind the hilton and some apartments.

This little place tucked just south of the main Scottsdale drag is quite a gem. I found a food tasting forum on-line which mentioned it as a noteworthy stop for some really great food. That was an understatement; from the parking lot it looks a little sketchy but never judge a book by it's cover.  Not only is this place very easy on the wallet, it's so interesting!  In addition to being a deli it is also a small Italian grocery with numerous wines, oils, cheeses, and meats.  I originally stopped in for their Philly Cheese steak and, having been to Philadelphia this past year I can honestly say this sandwich earns that name, so delicious.  If I'm ever in the area I love to take my friends and family for a bite to eat.

I brunched at this quaint little diner recently with a friend and was not disappointed.   I ordered the corned beef hash and she, an omelette off the specials. Everything was great, and the warm little muffins were excellent! Make sure your order comes with the baker's basket.  Our server was very cheerful, and prompt. The atmosphere reminded me of eating breakfast at grandma's house, a happy feeling to be sure.

Ordered for game night,  Had both thin and hand-tossed. The thin crust is definitely the way to go, great pizza!  It's a little on the expensive side for pizza, and make sure you ask when you're ordering and have a question, Garlic Bread =/= Cheese Garlic Bread, both excellent, but completely different.  ciao

After a 20 minute wait upon arrival our driver came to our stop. He seemed very unorganized and there were numerous forms of ticketing which caused even further confusion and another 15 minute delay sitting in the bus on the curb. The ride proceeded with wild speed bounding between lanes, by the time we got to the hotel we were glad to gtfo of that nightmare.  Unfortunately our experience didn't end there. On our return trip to the airport we were told to be where we were dropped off at 1:25, by 1:55 there was no shuttle and we called in and come to find that our driver is TWENTY minutes away... And we had no notification. The call rep casually suggested that we find another mode of transportation. Uhh.... We pre booked this shuttle as part of a package and I WISH I had done a little more research.   TLDR: Save yourself the hassle and take a taxi/uber.

Stopped in had sushi a second time this last week and was not disappointed. It's a really fun little spot. Family run business, which I love, and wonderful fare. 5-6pm is their happy hour on, oh I'd say, 1/3 of their rolls. They play fun music and serve beer. I'm definitely making this place our go-to spot when were in this part of town.  Our favorite rolls were the tuna, shrimp tempura, and the captain crunch!

Great little Italian joint nearby with wonderful dishes at medium prices.   We love their olive oil and pesto dip and fresh bread. Great service with friendly and consistent staff.  Their outdoor seating area is reminiscent of an Italian street corner, very lovely atmosphere. Wine bottles half off on Wednesday too.

Great work!  We chose the hourly rate and put these fellas to work, orchestrating 5 different stops with two patio sets, two dining room sets, a bed, and two china hutches was no small feat.  They worked quickly, were strong, and packed everything very efficiently, nothing was broken and they took care of details like glass tops, shelving, drawers, and doors, very thoughtful.   They accepted credits and were done in a flash.  Very happy with this service and will definitely recommend them to family and friends, as well as use them again in the future!

After about half a dozen tastings at other shops and the bridal fare we landed at Kick Ass Kakes, and wow, what a relief! I don't think no is in their vocabulary, we were treated like family, any detail we were after, Jay would draw it up(if I can find the drawing I'll have to post it up alongside the cake). I think Jay might be a little shy but is a very generous fellow.  We had KaK cater the cake for our wedding which included a small 3-layer cake for us to cut, many regular cupcakes, and mini cupcakes to boot. Their toffee cake was my favorite and I'm so glad we booked with them.  I'm eagerly awaiting our year anniversary for an easy excuse to buy another! :D

I've been to this place a few times in the past two years and stopped in again today for a quick lunch. The lady at the register says, "haven't seen you in a while!" I was taken aback that she remembered me! I'm happy to say that I really like this little family-run market/deli and their fantastic selection of foreign groceries. While I wait for my order I love looking at their strange and wonderful selection of canned and dried goods, most especially their sweets!   Very good customer service and the little man with glasses is seemingly always sprightly and comical.   I get their Gyros and it's always fresh and tasty. I'm sure I'll be back many more times.

Fantastic little place, everything from the drinks and food, to the music and decor are all old time classics.   I went with a friend to their Tuesday night Swing Dancing lesson. Everyone was very friendly and encouraging, some music was contemporary rehashed in a swing style which was fun! I hope to visit again soon, and definitely recommend it for a night out of the ordinary.  Drinks are served in different sized mason jars, which add to the atmosphere even though prices have inflated a little since the 50s.

Hate to review after only one visit, I will be going back again to give it a second chance.  This location, like many of their others, have many many TVs, busy atmosphere, and happy people.   First off, I ordered a well whiskey and coke, which wasn't bad, but after that was finished I was asked if I wanted another. I agreed and when it arrived it was a glass nearly twice the size of the first. This would have been awesome had it been the same liquor/soda ratio, but this next drink was nearly all coke...  Ordered the grilled tenders with honey BBQ sauce and a side salad instead of fries. The salad and tenders came at the same time. Can't say that I'd order their side salad again. The chicken was served without the BBQ sauce and without utensils to eat the food with. My friend and I sat there for probably 10 minutes before we caught the waitress again to get silverware and the sauce for the chicken.  The server was very friendly but I paid for the food and service, in which both were unfortunately lacking.

Visited this place last week when my folks were in town,  It's an older style family restaurant, I ordered some carnitas tacos and a Chile relleno. The tacos were ok, the Chile relleno was good, and their rice was excellent, really enjoyed it.   I was terribly sick about a half an hour after leaving the restaurant and it lasted a day and a half. By sick I mean making sure a bathroom was within running distance.  Wish it didn't happen, but that's life. Won't be going back. :(

On first glance, this is a charming little pizzeria with an inviting atmosphere. They have a nice indoor-outdoor bar with lots of extra seating.   I visited at around 9pm and they were still busy with customers. They serve Four Peaks brews on tap which is a nice change.   I ordered their house sausage sandwich with a side of greens with a vinaigrette. The food took about 20 minutes, was a good portion, and very tasty. I'm glad there is a new bar/restaurant on Happy Valley Road, and will very likely be visiting again.

I dropped my iphone 6 on gravel shattering it's screen while working on my sprinkler system and had heard of this spot. It's Yelp reviews are of very high praise and I must admit the man works very quickly.   The Yelp coupon worked as advertised, I paid cash and the repair was completed in about 40 minutes, which was perfect for my lunch break.  The only reason I docked a star is the appearance of the shop. It's in a small strip mall, and the store front is unremarkable. You'll walk in and it's a very empty shop bare walls, very little furniture, and an overall shabby appearance. This may deter some but he does do good work MUCH faster than the Apple Store, and cheaper if you get the Yelp deal.

12 noon this place is packed! I've been to this location almost half a dozen times and it's a great alternative to the options in the vicinity. They have great daily deals and the Taco Tuesday crowd is especially thick, definitely expect a line.  My go-to is the pork tacos and pico, tasty stuff, and their tortillas are great! They go through them so quickly they're usually making them on demand right there in front of you.  The price is a tad high, but you do get what you pay for. I miss Bajio, but this restaurant rightly deserves the spot and I'm glad they opened shop.  Be sure you grab a frequent customer card as you pass through the check out. After 10 stamps you get a free entree. Enjoy!
