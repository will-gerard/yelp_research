On Friday September 25 we contacted the print area via phone regarding memorial flyers for our mother's funeral services. It was an unexpected death and we did not know time tables on these kinds of things. We arrived later that day and spoke with Cassandra in person. We want to let you know that Cassandra went above and beyond for us. We are very thankful for everything she did for us. She is the kind of employee that you want working for you. As a manager myself for the last 20 year, she did everything to perfection. In our eyes she deserves a raise for outstanding customer service. Again, thank you for having such a wonderful employee working for you. It's not too often that you run into these types of employees and you should feel honored to have her.

Best spot hands down for a cut and a shave!! I have been going to A&D since I moved to the valley...its been years.   Its always Top notch service at A&D. Its a great business and they always gets me in and out. I also have never...never had a bad cut. I can not say that for other places that I tried before finding A&D. No need for an appointment...walk ins all good. The barbers are cool, the decor is top notch with personal tv at your chair, and you get what you pay for.  What you get:   Professional Looking Cut  Hot Towel & Shave  Massage  Drink  and some good ol' barber shop convo.   all for about $20   If your looking for a good barber and a classy spot...this is it. I'm glad that I found the spot.

After 10yrs in the Valley, I finally found this Little hidden Gem. I honestly have to say its was the best Jewish deli I've been to. No more Subway when I'm craving a sandwich...Its close to the Biltmore area, which is a huge plus for me because its close to home. Just like any Deli its seat yourself type of place with a deli counter for your to-go orders. I luv this spot!!  Food: 5 STARS I ordered the Pastrami on garlic bread. It had a huge portion of meat covered with Swiss chesse and grilled onions. It also came with homemade fry's and coleslaw. I was very impressed with the size of the meal. IT WAS AMAZING!!!!  Not only do they serve sandwiches, but they had a huge menu from breakfast to entrees. Everything that passed by our table looked great.  SERVICE: 5 STARS From the moment we walked in ..we were welcomed with a friendly greet...to the moment we were leaving they made sure everything was perfect.  Location: 5 STARS centrally located in the valley in a nice shopping complex. Next to Ace Hardware.  PRICE: 4 STARS  $12.50 for Huge Pastrami Sandwich/ Fries/ coleslaw. It was a big portion, but just a tad pricey for lunch price. Take $2.50 off and it would of been a 5 too.  I def will be back all the time with friends and family regardless your pricing... Thank you for the Great Lunch.

First timers, so on a Friday night we decided to give another non chain restaurant our $$. Texas Grill it was. Upon walking in it kinda has a flea market vibe look. Definitely needs an update to remove clutter that should not be decor.(business cards, hats, etc)  if you can ignore that grungy look... the sevrice was great. Very friendly gal.   The food was huge portions..i couldnt finish and that doesnt happen often. No draft beers but a good bottle beer selection. Served with a tiny cold glass. We really enjoyed our meals and we will be back again soon to try something else

Pats pizza is very good. In fact this should be a 5 star, but they sent the wrong pizza on delivery. It was later in the evening aroun 730p and the gf wakes up at 3a for work, so to delay dinner for the correct one was out of the picture. The next time we order it came perfect. I probably would of even gave them 5star if the driver or business would of apologized for the mistake.. instead i got just a ..well u want me to take it back.  That is my only complaint..otherwise pizza was great.   We will try them out again..and maybe check out some other items off the menu.

First, Let me start by stating that I have been in the car business for over 10 years. I understand the service shop inside and out as a manager for many years. I also know a bad service rates (overcharge) and a good price. With that said, I had already diagnosed the issue with the girlfriends brake lights not turning on and had pre-purchased the part. It was raining this day and I had no dry place to make the replacement and it needed to be done immediately due to no break lights turning on. I had called around to several shops. It was getting late..around an hour or so before closing and Just Brakes did the repair quickly and professionally. Did I mention they quoted a very fair price and it is why I have given the gf the ok to get further work, oil changes, etc from this location. The price beat the next cheapest quote by $15, so glad they did. Repair was done in 20 mins.  They have proven to me they are good shop without the BS.   I have read some of the other reviews and feel that some are ill warranted. Most repair shops do the absolute best to get you in and out, however this isn't your barber or hair salon.. things can cause delays like lunches. I had a great experience and maybe they have new management now??  I would recommend highly. We are Very Please! Thanks again.

Best Chicago Pizza in the Valley... We wouldn't have it any other way. I have been in the Valley over ten years and have try'd them all it seems like. I still prefer Rosati's any day of the week.  Thanks for being a great location and great service as well as delivery. See you next time for another "Monster Pie"

I have been here a few times and every time it has been Awesome. Food is fresh and hot...did I mention Awesome!! Only giving 4 stars because dining room interior could use a major over hall. Which I would totally recommend the owners look into. With food that good, give us a nice spot to relax enjoy a drink and your Bomb.com food.

This St. Patty's Day,  we decided to try out the Gelato Spot. We have been in the same parking lot countless times, but never made it in. Upon arrival the Gelato Spot has a great looking case of eye tempting Gelato's. I was hoping they were going to taste as good as they looked. As I sampled a couple flavors, I must say I wasn't finding my craving. I decided to go with the cookies n cream. I asked the young lady what she recommended to go with it. She asked the other girl and she said the "salted Carmel" ....now I have had this flavor at many other places and enjoy it, so i didn't sample it. I should have. It was absolutely terrible!  It was so salty that you would think they emptied the whole bottle in it. Honestly you couldn't pay me to eat this garbage...because that is were it ended up when we got back home. Why on earth would you recommend this to a new customer.  On another note, other might think twice about buying from this business. When we arrived, a group of young folks were talking with the employee. she was going on and on about how the pop is over a year past the expiration date and the only reason they got rid of the lemonade is that it turned brown....now that is disgusting!   1. Either this place has no quality control and is run by young folks that dont care or  2. The management has no control of the employees  Its a true shame ...we expected a lot more out of this place and we will not be back. I would rather go to any of the other competitors in the area.

This place has Great service. We have been frequent customers  and will continue to be.  Not only is the service great, but the food is outstanding and I would highly recommend trying them out during happy hour to see for yourselves. We enjoy the sangrias here. They are some of the best we've  had.

Love the Location, it is right around the corner from our home. So we decided to give this a try for the first time.   The staff is super friendly and let us know about the special right away. Im glad we tried it out. The 5.99 burger deal was way worth it. It was also delicious! The Gf also got the fried ice cream which was very tasty.  We will be back to try out the prime rib

I must start this by saying I have been a long time customer and fan of Pei Wei. However, tonight this location has failed yet again and you have lost my business for good.   Appearance and cleanliness 1 star  This place is DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY... No care to the outside of the property or inside. Outside you have grease and food trails all the way to the dumpster which is open and in full view of the front door.. might consider trying to hide the garbage and buy a pressure washer or hire a weekly service. Just gross! Inside the floors were covered in rice and food all over. Worn decor the has this location screaming I'm in need of some maintenance and remodeling. Even the bricks behind the wok stations were dirty and stainless steel racks above where they are cooking your meals were cover in old dryer food! GROSS!   This isn't the reason for the overall 1 star.  Food 4stars.  Service 1 star This is the only reason Pei Wei has my business. Food is great. When they don't mess up your order.  Out of  the last 6 visits, 3 of those times the order was incorrect. All To Go orders both placed in person and phone. You've proven that it doesn't matter. This location just does not have a good quality control. Tonight your manager comes out to us as we were waiting for our TO GO order, an apologizes that the kitchen made the order wrong and it was being remade. I was great...yet again another bad experience, to try to make it right she did give us $20 gift card. Where this manager failed is my order when I pulled it out of the bag at home ...WAS WRONG! YES, all that extra wait and I still had to call and eat a meal I did not order, WTF! How does this happen, receipt clearly states shrimp and steak. No shrimp whatsoever that I paid extra for.   If you do not fix this locations problems, I see it closing. I spoke w my neighbors and they said they don't eat there either because of similar experiences. Such a shame. Owners/Corporate needs to get out of their offices and see the issues the hired help from the Management on down has been neglecting.

Jackrabbit has once again made it back on top as the place to be if your going out for a night in Scottsdale. Jackrabbit has new owners and New security/door men/ wait staff/ bartenders....basically from what I saw they came in and cleaned up the place. The patio is remodeled as well as VIP areas. I was very impressed the past 2 visits. I personally think they have the hottest wait staff in scottsdale, so if your getting a VIP table that is a big perk.  I recommend going here on a Thursday night. It's Thursday Baby! Thursday promotion in which they usually bring in live talent. The Night I was there ..FAR EAST MOVEMENT and MIMS were performing, which is all included in the cover. Or get in Free by FACEBOOK ...you can contact the owner Don Serpe on his personal page or one of Jackrabbit's other pages and you are put on a list. He seems like a great fresh face for a place that had problems. I also checked out Saturday night this week and DMX performed. From what promoters told me at the club they will have a Live Big Name Artist there every week putting on a show for all to enjoy.   Only Con is if you dont like a lot a people this is not the place for you. It does get full and takes you time to get through the crowd. Otherwise I am very impressed that they got rid of the rude staff and changed things up. I will be back with all my friends.

Jackrabbit Lounge is Still #1 in my book...Been back a few more times since the last post... Still the best spot. Still having great Service.  No cover before 10:30p and they always are having live entertainment show up.    B.O.B. was this last Saturday. Here's a link to the video from  facebook.  http://www.facebook.com/#!/video/video.php?v=1421432460623&notif_t=video_tag    Its worth the $10 cover if you show up later...no place is doing it like the new owners of Jackrabbit. If you pay this at other clubs....what do you get?? SOOO...get your friends together...check out Jackrabbit's Facebook page to pick out a night...and Do yourselves a favor and go have a good time at what I think is the best spot.  On  side Note...I see the horrible service comments ...Ive never had bad service....never had any extra charges.....The staff of girls at Jackrabbit are hands down the best ;-)   I also take care of my waitress and tip accordingly...Ive been to all the other clubs(Revolver,PCL,Dirty Pretty)...just my opinion. Also the reason Im reviewing the club again..at a later date. Its a great spot and gets 5stars!!

Went here for Monday Night Football. Great Sport for Bears Fans!!  They have a ton of TV's and 3 big screen projectors. Great food for a sports bar as well...  Half Moon is a relax chill sport to hang out afterwards as well. We had Great service and drinks were resonable....   It has a big Patio as well, looks like it could use a lil remodel however. Otherwise this place is great. You should go check it out.

Club Silver is back open. Great spot!!!!  This is a classy joint. I am very impressed with what they did to this club. I showed up to the Re-launch party Friday Night. It was a $10 cover, BUT it was OPEN BAR..yes OPEN BAR..everything was free til Midnight. I think everyone in my group couldnt believe it. After our 5th or 6th drink we switch to shots of Patron and it was still only 11p. All the drinks were strong Top shelf  pours...CROWN ROYAL, GREY GOOSE, JACK...How can you go wrong.  I mean the Light  rail is right outside the front door. No need to drive. This promotion is on every 3rd Friday....better call the club to find out more. This is just what they said that night.  I will def be back with all the friends. The place is going to be a new hot spot for us for sure. Young crowd...close to US Airways Center...and great DJ mixin it up.  Check this spot out. Im sure you will be glad you did.

3.5 rounded up.   I can say I have been going to Fuji Buffet since they opened. I am a frequent customer that is becoming a little less frequent.   This place used to be amazing and I'm afraid that its losing it freshness. My last 2 visits have only been OK at best. The place is always clean and service is good. What has been lacking is the buffet itself. Only about half the dishes are fresh the last couple visits and when asked to bring out fresh on some older dishes that need to be switched up ...they never seem to show up. Unless they did after I had left.   On a side note: The food that is Fresh is Very good, flavorful. I enjoy the crab puffs and alot of the chicken and seafood dishes. Also the Crab legs.   I'm guessing this is why the customer base is slowly getting smaller. In the past when I went here the place was always packed. Now not so much. I hope the owner or Manager takes care of the issues. Would still like to have a good buffet close to the house.

Upon arrival I was surprised to find No line at 700p on a Friday. The Norterra location had a car show going on right outside of Sauce, so we had a little walk...after finding parking. Sauce has a chalk board of menu items. Pizza, Salads, Bruschetta, and Pasta to choose from.   The atmosphere of Sauce is very inviting. Modern/ industrial look. Very inviting.  7 out of 10  So, after a long debate..at least it seemed that way because I was starving. We order the Chicken, Apple, Gorgonzola spinach salad and a sausage and caramelized onion pizza to share. I do suggest the thin crust over Sauce's hand stretched crust. The salad was Amazing 10 out of 10. We both enjoyed it very much and it paired nicely with our wine. The Pizza was an 7 out of 10.   If your a vino drinker ..they have a nice selection to choose from as well.  Service was good. You order at the counter and they bring everything to your table. Everything came out fresh and Hot! However, they forget to ask how everything was and as a Fox restaurant I know that is not the norm.

Tonight was my last night visiting a former Fox Restaurant  business that has gone downhill. I learned Sam sold off Sauce two years ago and it explains a lot. It used to be excellent..food, service, and upkeep. However, my last two visits have been very poor. So much so, that tonight when our pizza showed up 30mins  after our salads and it was cold and soggy. I outright asked for a refund. Something I normally would never do. The manager tried to tell me it was not sitting long, but you could tell by looking at it that was just bs. I've worked in the restaurant  business for some time. I would say your service is below standard. Cleanliness of this restaurant  was also in bad shape. On another note to the current owner that may or may not see this review. Management should look like managers. This young lady was not in business attire. She was so casual I didn't even know who she was when looking for assistance. So, that's why I stood back in line to ask for a refund. Total fail. Too bad..I will give my business elsewhere.

Culver's is a must if you have not had the chance to try them out. I believe they have several stores now here in the valley. The Root Beer is a must as well as the Butter Burgers, Cheese curds, Frys, Frozen custurd....lol ...the list goes on... I have not found anything as of yet that I did not enjoy.

So, Ive been drivng by this place for years...and when it came time to decide where to go for dinner...well it slipped my mind. All I can say is it wont slip my mind any longer...  It is a very nice spot. Dimmed lighting and great decor. Modern   The Food was excellent. We ordered the calamari, a dinner size portion salad and split it, and a pasta dish...everything came out perfect and service was prompt. Very friendly waitstaff.  Only negative was the seats...all of us would of had more drinks and stayed longer but they were not too comfortable. Otherwise it was a great dining experience. We will be back...hopefully they get some cushions :-)

Really cant believe the stupidity of the caliber of employees,  4 different Carls Jr. Managers from 2 stores. First store place order...order was discovered to be wrong NOT only the wrong burger, but absolutely plain several mins later after I left was on HWY....another Carls Jr. store on the way home I stop tell them the problem. NOW SAME OWNERS OF THESE LOCATIONS...I ASKED FIRST QUESTION... the store asst. managers both tell me NO they cant replace the burger from both stores...I have witnesses (a friend and 6 customers, 1 of whom left once she heard what was going on).....It gets better they both say they cant give away free food....and they dont want to get in trouble for it....MEANWHILE IM HEATED AND LAUGHING FROM THE STUPIDITY......Its was listen I paid for this shit $8.17 to be exact...your not giving me anything for free...Im looking for what I paid for...Meanwhile Now the Managers of each store is involved on phone and THEY REFUSED.......WTF REALLY IS WRONG WITH  YOUNG PEOPLE THESE DAYS...IS OUR YOUNGER GENERATION OF KIDS REALLY THIS DUMB!!  To FINISH I will be calling Corporate on both stores, the BBB, and emailing sites all over the internet.

Went to Stingray last night and Have to say Im a fan of both Stingray's (Scottsdale/Biltmore)... However, the New location is great ...chill location, so far not totally packed and always seem to be able to get a spot right away. Great Happy Hour. $5 sushi rolls,apps, and drinks. Can get a ton of food for cheap.  The bad thing was service is still lacking ...coin flip if you get a great server or one you have to wait on them verse them waiting on you...overall experience is good.

I suggest Trying the $14 Kobe Burger. It was amazing. It was a little wait for a seat ...usually a good sign. Also a little wait for the food, so dont come by yourself.  We grabed some wine and both had Kobe Burgers Med. They might of been the Best burgers I've had in the valley. Way Better than Deluxe. Cant go wrong with sweet potatoe frys either.

Soo, I decided to finally try this place out thats close to the house. I took a date here on a Friday night. I was a huge Fan of the place from the minute we got there. I loved the vibe of the place and the friendly staff.   When we arrived we were told about specials and wait time....so we hit up the bar and waited for our table. Enjoy'd some good Red wine. and our host found us and took us to our table.  We order the Gumbo and the Carne Asada plates. Both were good. But the GUMBO WAS GREAT!!! would def order again....

They always have great new things to try... visit this location every week and Im never disappointed.   Not only are Fresh and Easy stores cheap to begin with, but they run some of the best deals weekly in town. Not to mention they have a discounted section in every store. Luv the grab-and Go section for when Im in a hurry for a lunch or dinner...they are very good. Pizzas are excellent as welll as the Hummas and their brand of chips.  Can sign up online for coupons  = $6 off of a $30 purchase which make good deals even better....amazing.

First off let me say that I dont get the chance to eat Indian food as often as I would like. . . and that is because we don't have any good Indian restaurants in the central phx area. So when I ended up in the East valley today I had to check this place out due to all the good reviews!!!   I was skeptical and on edge that this might not be the experience that I was hoping for...maybe too spicy ...or old food under heat lamps...or bad service...NOT THE CASE!! THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!   India Oven is 10 out of 10 for me.   Service: 10  A smile and a greet as we entered with the wonderful aroma of the buffet made it easy...I was in the right place. Our waiter was very professional and personable. He made our first experience Great as he told us about the chef and his 40 yrs of around the world cooking from Europe to India to the USA. I couldn't wait to go taste his cooking. They also have a Full bar in a classy environment. Great place to take a client for lunch or date for dinner. Quick side note: India Oven is not that big and I'm sure once the word gets out...expect a wait. Great 42" LCD on the Wall , so we got to watch the College game.   Buffet: 10   Let me just say at first glance .... I was Lost and my mouth was watering... it all smelled so good and everything and I mean everything was FRESH. The Chicken Curry, Lamb Curry, Chicken Marsala all were Fantastic! We were told by the staff the buffet always changes for lunch and every dinner service. I cant wait to try other dishes from this place. It was all soo good .... you will want to keep going up til you explode. They also bring Indian bread and a Sizzling plate of chicken and Lamb to your table that also was amazing.   Price: 10   At $9.95 you simply can not beat it.   I just wish this place was close to the house. I would def be a frequent customer. I would also be gaining a few pounds. Do yourself a favor and try this place out. I can seriously say I dont think you can go wrong.

I drive 30 min just for some Yogurtini. This place is great!!   Its Cheap!  Its perfect for a group of friends!!   Best of all....  The Flavors are great!! and they have a ton of topping choices for you to choose from.  Also flavor combinations that they recommend are posted. Check it out its by the checkout on the wall...a little in the wrong spot, but hey you only have soo much room on the walls I guess.   I first discovered Yogurtini from a Friend who took me there for a healthy snack after the gym. All I can say is now I cant stay away. You must stop by and try it out. Sample cups are available to try any flavors out. Usually by the register to keep the kids from making a total mess of the place I assume.   Everything is low Cal and price is based on weight. It is all posted so you can check it out at the start of the line. Great location. Great looking decor.

Big Fan of this 24hr spot in the Biltmore area. Not the hood ...lol (Jason's post). As far as Mexican spots in central phx/biltmore area...this is your spot. This tops my list of places I luv late night but try to stay away from...lol...to avoid packing on those extra pounds.  I Totally recommend the Carne Asada Burrito and the Green Avacado salsa...soo good. I wish they sold it bottled up.  The food is excellent and you always get too much .....

I was very impressed with everything about this spot.  The Decor was modern and well done. Open Lay-0ut w/ Patio.  The Order style is Fast food style ...order at the counter and wait. Food was quickly made. Was Fresh and No complaints.  The Food: I ordered a  Street Tacos plate with Carnita Asada, Pollo, and Shrimp. All of it was AMAZING. Salsa was Great too!!!.  Will be back. ONLY next time I'll bring friends.

Well,  what can I say... this place sure has gone downhill. I ate here in the past and it was good. BUT NOT TONIGHT!  Ordered Chips/salsa, Chimichanga, ... all was BLAND and no flavor. Friend ordered: Pollo enchalada w/ beans and rice...same story Bland and old bean and rice.  ONLY THING I HAD THAT WAS GOOD WAS THE CORONA. LOL  I had to look around again to make sure I was in a mexican joint. I will def not be back. Over priced too.  I suggest u go anywhere else but here.

I headed over to ZOYO Neighborhood Yogurt this Sunday afternoon...and got nothing but good things to say. Plus its a couple blocks from the house...so glad to have them in the Neighborhood.  The Decor is Modern and has a total open indoor/ outdoor setup with sliding glass doors that opens this place up...very inice. Sit inside or out on the patio either way ..your going to enjoy the day at this spot.  The Pricing is great.....its a cheap sweet low cal treat. Only 39cents a ounce for all the frozen yogurt and toppings you want.  The Frozen Yogurt.  Its was very good. Many choices to choose from and they have sample cups to taste test. I was very happy with my selections of Peanut butter, Chocolate, and vanilla :-)   I will be back ...maybe too often... hope they change the flavors often...we will see.

Not much to add when an establishment has so many great reviews.  Just that this is by far the best burger spot in the valley and beat the chains restaurants any day.   The special is always a nice change if you've tried everything  else. I also like the French toast fries. Great treat for that sweet tooth.

After being a customer for just over 3 months, I wanted to compliment  this store on outstanding performance. Shelves are always full and stocked. The staff is friendly.  Most importantly, you save us a lot compared to Fry's, Albertsons, Safeway, and Sprouts.   For Example: 73% lean ground beef we got today was only $1.83 lb.   Compared to Fry's and Safeway $2.49 lb as well as Albertsons at $2.99 lb. Great price!  We always leave with what seems like double the amount of groceries for the same dollar amount. Keep up the stellar job on a clean store with great products.

This last Saturday we couldnt figure out what we wanted for lunch...this always ends up meaning time to grab some pizza. We love trying out new spots and boy are we glad we tried Federal.  This pizza spot has great decor. A modern look with bar.  We order a happy hour pitcher of beer for only $5, score! We started it off with the little side salads w yellow beets. It was very good.  We also got the meatball pizza. It was awesome. Best pizza Ive had in a long time.  BTW: HUGE FAN of the fresh parm grated on the pizza for you.   Cant wait til next time!

Note: We will no longer give any business to Federal.  This was a bad experience with the food. Sad, but its ruined all our pizza cravings for now. So, good luck w the place..but we will find a new spot the next time we want pizza.

Yes, I am a FAN!   Very Friendly staff from the moment we walked in the door. We did feel a little under dressed, after a day of shopping...however that did not stop us. The decor is nice and the food was amazing. I would highly recommend trying this spot out.  We enjoyed it and will be back for another meal and some more drinks.

Totally recommend the carne asada..it was fab! Great flavor. The chips and guacamole was ok. Nothing special. However, the papas fritas were outstanding..the best ive had.  Also, the mix drinks were great. Wish they carried Luna tequila..would of enjoyed that in my margarita. Anyways..we will be back many times more..close to home and awesome

Great atmosphere! Crap service and management.  Lets start  with our first impression. Show up and only a 15 minute wait with seats available at the bar on the corner. That's awesome for a  Saturday night! Told the hostesses we would be sitting on the corner of bar right by us ( 2 calls, apparently she can take a number but not notes) Not a hard position, my dear.  We order a couple margaritas from a friendly bartender. Drinks were good and his service was attentive. Your doing this restaurant a big favor.  That's when this review goes bad. We were then seated outside in beginning of March at 8p. Weather had changed to getting cool fast. Hello Mr or Ms Manager. When people have thier arms close to thier bodies and hands between thier legs, it should be a sign to stop standing around and start making sure paying guests are comfortable. Look around, be observant it's almost half the patio doing the same thing. Train your staff. Yes, I've managed for 15yrs and it's not rocket science. That's why your owner bought the outdoor heaters.  Our waiter was overwhelmed. We saw him twice. Order was right except for the extras we order did not come. I informed him on my girls last couple bites. And then he wanted to go grab them, no thanks! Too late, you should check with your tables within the first few mins of thier food arrival. However, he wouldn't have known. He didn't even bring our food out , nor did he pick up our check. We checked ourselves out...and your lucky we are not thieves. 10+ min to pick up a cc is unacceptable after u drip it off. Btw, u are welcome for the tip ..you didn't deserve it. Note to owner: if you need a consultant for you nice restaurant feel free to contact my company. Apparently your managers are failing you as this is our second bad experience, but food is good. I have people on my staff with 20+yrs of experience.

Attention Corporate: This is the ONLY location in the Phoenix valley that is failing all customer standards. And I highly suggest to any customers to go elsewhere. Zupas other locations are far better at everything from customer service, food portions, cleanliness of the restaurant. The management needs to be let go and this location revisited by your corporate office.   Let me say this review is after 7 visits. All visits have been about the same. Poor or rude customer service, an issue that is easily resolved by good management. Portions way under serving compare to other Zupas. (for ie. The soup was not even half full and she insisted she was correct) I refused it and so did the next 2 people after stating the issues to make a point. My last visit she missed the cup and didn't even clean it off. I had to ask them at the register. No sense of pride, for your brand. Salads are also skimpy here. I frequent your establishment to eat and be filled up. A half cup of reg.soup and 3/4 of a half salad will make any customer question if they should continue business with you. My $30 a visit could easily be spent elsewhere.  To top this location off, the staff is lazy. From dirty prep areas as you watch them prepare and question if you would pass a AZ health dept inspection. The dining room is also always dirty, which as a manager myself Im always tempted to take off the soda fountain nozzels because I'm sure they are dirty too. I am a long time customer of your Biltmore location and thank them for the great service, I hope you take care of this locations issues. Sincerely, Annoyed and Done with this location.

I Stopped in before Xmas for a gift for the nephew. They were very informative and helpful. This GameStop had a large selection, which was nice.  I would suggest stopping by if you need a game for your console.  However, just watch you change ... I happened to give the gentlemen a $100 and he handed back like 38cents..forgot the $50 bill... I'm sure it was a mistake, however I have seen this before as a manager in retail. So, buyer beware just in case it was not a mistake. As soon as I mentioned it..I was given the correct change.

This little spot has become our go to when we are in the mood for BBQ. OUTSTANDING on all levels. Location is a little hidden from the road, but you will love it when you find it. It a smaller restaurant and can be very busy. Decor is well done. WE ENJOY READING THE COMMENTS  ON THE WALL. FOOD Might be the best BBQ in the valley.  I really like Haps, but this just became our fave. The owner was very nice and let us sample the different  meats our first visit. 5 stars   We are so glad that they are close by. See you soon.

This Friday night, we decided to give this nieghborhood bar a try. We arrived around 8p. It was already busy and we seated ourselves(no sign, but its a bar) about 10m later we did get a server. He was excelent and very refreshing to have a great personality as well as the on point recommendations to our tastes. They did a nice job with the remodel from the former 16th st sports bar.   The atmosphere: Very similar to Little Woodys on Indian School. Wood accents on the walls with games to keep you entertained in 2 rooms. Fun place for a group. Hands down ..this is 5stars  The Food: I went with the Cubano sandwich and upgraded to the loaded fries. The gf got the  prosciutto grilled cheese and upgraded to the zucchini fries. I was amazed we hadnt heard that this place was bomb.com .. we live very close and no nieghbors talking about this hidden gem. Wow! The food is worth the stop in alone. 5stars We will be back many more times for a quick bite.  Later on in the night, a dj sets up and the dance party starts. We had sat down next to the dj booth not knowing. Eventhough he was great on the turn tables..im afraid Id fire him for how he interacts with your customers. We saw him repeatedly pushing back on ladies as they came over for requests leaning over top of booth. Believe me i know the business well, as Ive worked in the industry. It was uncalled for, a simple wave to show them to come over to the side would of been all that was needed. Not flipping out and being rude(putting hands on guests) and worrying about his unsecured laptop.  Remember these are your paying customers..he didnt seem to care.. This was our only dislike, but im sure he's just contacted help. Lose em.. plenty of other djs out there with talent.   I will speak with a manager in a less busy time the next time we stop in.   Overall our experience was good. We would of stayed longer but the above mentioned issue made the gf want to leave. Regardless we will be back.

I'll start with stating I was not going to leave a review however issues persist and we are going to make it public after 9  1/2months of the run around.  Derrick, whom no longer works for Seven apts/Greystar was a warm and very friendly guy. He did everything that he could to make our first bad experiences on this property a little better through compensation. (Maybe he was the smart one getting out right away) The new management stepped in about our 3rd month here. This property had a RM working it for a few weeks. The new manager had his work cut out for him to clean up all the issues. He is a friendly manager and will tell you what you want to hear. This has become the problem. He has yet to resolve our move in check list, our storage unit that was given to us per previous manager was re-rented and key given out without notice to us.(our items were stolen and Seven claims no responsibility for), and promises to resolve ongoing issues just continue. I like the guy, but you can only take things not getting resolved for so long before you feel its an act.  We were the first ones to look at the property and first to move in according to Derrick. Our move-in date kept getting changed and this caused a HUGE issue with the property in the Biltmore that our lease was up on. Because of the property being unfinished and still not released by construction, we were told things incorrectly. Those things we were told we would have that you will NOT find in this luxury property  are Stainless steel appliances, flat top (glasstop) range, or high end kitchen faucet. You will find instead black lower end refrigerator / dishwasher and coil burner electric range. The kitchen faucet is the standard cheapo .. and ours has broke off twice already and is loose again. These are NOT LUXURY apartments, and I do question what legality standing they have to classify them as such. Is it the linoleum fake wood floors, the  cheap Formica counters, low end appliances. Just more false advertising, in my opinion. If it was granite, high end appliances, or even wood flooring...maybe then Luxury.  The only thing super nice is the clubhouse and pool area (until damages were done by tenants)  With any new construction, issues are sure to be there.  We turned in a list of big issues we wanted corrected nine (9) months ago. However, those have not been addressed yet.  This alone is the reason for this review! Also, we have had to fight for those things that were promised to us upon signing the lease.  NOTE: GET EVERYTHING IN WRITING! Do Not take verbal promises. Also as stated in other reviews, some amenities have been changed without notice. We have pest issues with crickets and scorpions. Yes you are bill monthly in the rent bill for this service that is never provided. Yes, we have asked for such services and they are NOT provided...again the reason for this review.   As for previous reviews about noise around the pool and why would someone complain if they live by the pool. I will answer this one for you. Management on this property promised well built sound proof construction and ensured us as tenants that we would not hear noise from the pool area. Let me also state the rent is $1050-$1400 or so depending on the unit, so peace and quiet is not part of that rent???? Let just get this out there. These are NOT sound proof by any means. So be prepared to be disturbed at all hour. Yes, you get a double dose. Once late at Night from all those loud drunks at the pool til 2-4am yelling, playing music, or whatever and then the kiddos arrive at 8-9a in the Morning, so if you don't have to work at the crack of dawn..good luck sleeping in or getting any sleep. You hear everything thru the windows/sliding glass door to the patio. Now let not forget the LEASE states no more than 2 guests (management says 4 is ok) which is Fine, but NO ONE follows it and Management has done nothing to resolve the HUGE Parties. I Guess its ok to invite everyone on your Facebook and have them show up at 11p in groups of 40+ at a time from same resident.. AS Far as Security to call and take care of the matter, NONE. Yes that too was promised several times. That has NEVER Happened. Countless Health city violations with pets in Pool area too can be observed.  I agree with previous posts about crime on this property. Beware! Just this last weekend a large bag of Meth was in the hallway, so if you have kids here be concerned. This is not a joke I'm sure you can inquire with the police department on crimes on this property. Cops were called and police report on file as well as verified by officers the drug found was indeed Meth... with this and many other issues like public sex acts, break ins. This property has gone downhill in a short period of time.  BEST ADVISE, Stay Away. This place has been the worst place in my 12yrs I've lived at in the valley.  We will find somewhere that actually is "Luxury" and can keep the property safe.

Glad to see Firehouse in the neighborhood. We will be regular lunch customers.  Our experience: Warm friendly greeting as soon as we entered. They continued to make sure everything was good throughout our lunch. 5stars for service  Food: We both decided to enjoy hot sandwiches today. I hot the meatball and the gf the hot italian. Both sandwiches were excellent. But I think my favorite is still your brisket :)  Price: In our opinion it's not that bad. We normally get the medium size combo each and costs us total under $20. Yes, it's more than Subway, but we don't eat there after recent events about their spokesman.. Besides the sandwiches are way better.  Atmosphere: This location is well done. I enjoyed that it was Thursday afternoon and NFL network was on both the large tvs. Thank you. You helped remind me to set my fantasy picks...lol Normal firehouse theme, if you haven't been to one I would recommend it.

We were craving Tacos...well it was taco Tuesday afterall. So, we decided to try someplace new. This place is on the smaller side, but was slow when we got there. The staff greeted us immediately and we got a seat  not long after. This was a plus.  The server was also the bartender. He was very friendly and did his best, but i think the end result is they could use another server. He forgot a few things(like drinks), but overall not terrible.   The food was excellent! We both had tacos. I tried the carne asada, pollo, and green chili pork. All were good and on special. They are smaller size so order a few extra is you are hungry.   We will try this place out again. I'd recommend it.

We arrived on a Saturday night around 8p. The atmosphere  is hip and new with middle eastern music playing softly. We were greeted immediately  and seated. The staff was very nice. They did say that they do a club like vibe w music after 10 with hookahs. 5 out of 5  We ordered drinks from the bar. The pours were good and not too heavy.    The food was amazing. We ordered and appetizer and I ordered the gyro and gf got the beef shawarna. We enjoyed them both.  We will be back. 5 out of 5.

Located on Highland and 20th st.  This is in the old Miracle Mile location. It has been totally remodeled and looks great. They did a nice job.  A perfect spot to grab a bite before grocery shopping. 5 stars  Service:  We were promptly greeted as we entered. We were offered some great recommendations once she realized it was our first time. We appreciate that. 5 stars  Food: I ordered the pesto chicken capavatti, which as amazing. I also got a ceasar salad(1.75 upcharge for side) will skip that next time. It was just ok. The gf got the loaded baked potato soup and caprese salad. Also very good soup, again her salad just ok. I tried the soup..will get that next time. Price was avg. $25 for dinner for 2 w drinks.  Overall 4 stars for food  To top it off we were given each a free cookie. They were awesome. Will be back for these! 5 stars for the freebie.  See you next time. Keep up the good service

Stop in this Saturday night around 8p. This is in the old Native New Yorker building. Always liked the layout. It's big with large bar area. Great location for a sushi spot.   Upon entering we were greeted immediately and sat in the bar area. It was a little slow but it soon picked up due to an amazing happy hour. We had no clue of these deals but will be back.  Happy Hour is from 2:30p-4:30p and 8p-Close. Great prices. SEE PIC POSTED.  SERVER/Bartender was friendly and did a great job.   Food The calamari app was excellent. We also got 2 sushi rolls which were fresh and on point and did I mention CHEAP!  I will be recommending this new spot to friends.

Our food was good. As it has always been.  4stars  Our service was excellent. 5stars  Your standards in the kitchen ...not so much! If you are going to thaw a large slab of beef.. first it has to be at least 6 inches off the floor according to health code. Secondly don't break the rules in front of the kitchen door for over a 45min period while your guest can see such disgusting practices.   We will not be back. You lost our business

4.5 stars Need a barber .. look no further.  I was very impressed with the total visit.   The decor is modern and very well done. The barber, professional and quite the comedian. Not to mention did an amazing job on the cut.  Now for the same changes that i would say would improve the experience. First time in, guess i should of just asked..but could of used a water, beer..whatever, its hot out. At least Offer your $25+ customer something. Secondly, i felt the hot towel service was lacking. It was on and off my face within a couple seconds.  This is much different at other barbers I've been to...and for the charge..give your customers an experience.  I understand that people are waiting and its busy, however a min changes that experience from wow that was rushed to wow that was nice.  Overall,  I thought they did a better job than some other barbers in the area. I will go back for a second experience.

Another Friday Night First... we arrived around 745p. The place was jumpin and the vibe was an immediate hit with us. Old School hip hop playin and modern decor. Another great addition to the neighborhood. Things got even better as the night progressed.   The sevice was prefect. Our server Randy had a great personality as well as great menu advise. He made our night very enjoyable. 5 out of 5stars  The Food.. well we left not being able to eat another bite.  It was all soo good. We started with the curry cauliflower and marinated skirt steak w chimichurri. These apps were not only cheap in our opinions, but amazing. For entrées we went with the Notorious B.I.G. Burger and the gf got the Ahi tuna sandwich. We also enjoy these.  You will find a large selection of beers and wine as well as specialty drinks. We enjoyed quite a few..lol  We will be back many more time. We love the wood fire grill and keep up the great service!

We have enjoyed Phoenix Ale House several times. This new brew spot has a great look. Its a little confusing from the road with the boarded up windows, however they are in the back of this building along with another restaurant. Totally worth the find. The beer selection is great. Lots to choose from. ..cant make up your mind. No problem. They have beer flights.  The service is the only reason for the 4 stars. Out of the 2 times we've visited. Its seems they have a rotating server. Always someone different coming by. Im not a fan of this because it can cause issues and delays. Which happened on visit 2. Maybe they just are working out the bugs of being new. The food was excellent.  We will come back again
