I love this place! Im half Thai and I know Thai food! Most Thai food places are way to Americanized. The food here is as authentic as you can get. If you know your Thai food they will even cook something for you that's not on the menu. That to me, is amazing customer service. Everyone is always friendly and I've never had to wait long for my food. It always comes out hot and tasting fresh! No frills needed for this girl....just great food and this place delivers on that!

We came to have a small celebration for my daughters 7th birthday and as she put it, it was "the BEST birthday EVER" ! I'm very lucky to have such a thankful child who was happy with her mom and dad, 1 Aunt, 1 Uncle, 1 Cousin and Grandma and Grandpa as the party guest!  Let me start by saying that we walked in not knowing what the heck we were gonna do, even though we've been there a million times before.  So we talked to Matty, the Manager and he gladly helped us out with the carry out special that we ate there.  He was very accommodation and super nice!  The pizza was great and the cheese and peppers shakers were all filled.  I know that seems like a very miniscule thing, but when all you want is to shake some cheese and pepper on your pizza, it's nice not having to go ask them to be refilled or ask the table behind you to use theirs.  All the games were working and none were out of tickets.  Matty even gave my daughter a big, ginormous purple Peter Piper Pizza pen for her birthday.  She LOVED it!  So thank you for making her very "quaint" party "the BEST birthday EVER!"

My husband was ALWAYS talking about this place! Lee's this and Lee's that....so of course, we had to go. I was positive he wouldn't stop talking about it until we did. Right ladies? You know what I'm talkin' bout! Well, as much as it pains me to say this .......he was right. Shhhhh, I'll never live it down if he knew I said that! We had the Grilled Pork Bahn Mi and it was so tasty! So many different flavors that made your mouth do the happy dance! Everything was fresh and the baguette was simply delicious! We each had a large iced crack, errrr I mean coffee!! Best Vietnamese coffee around. We, rather I, usually get 2 because I demolish the first one like it's a shot! It's gotta have crack in it! Just sayin'.... we live in Glendale and drive all the way to Chandler when we get a hardcore craving for some Bahn Mi and Vietnamese iced coffee. The absolute BEST place!!!!

I like coming to this Safeway.  Scott, the manager is super nice and he is ALWAYS there!  There is not a lot of people that shop here, which is nice when you're in a hurry.  I do most of my shopping at Frys but have noticed the last couple of times that the produce at Safeway has been cheaper and of better quality than Frys.  They normally have 2 registers open but they quickly call for help when the line gets a bit backed up. So if you are in a hurry and just need to get in and out quickly or want really good produce give this place a try!

I really like this place! It's small but I don't expect a grandiose atmosphere like some of the reviewers obviously wanted.  Like one said "Go to P.F Changs for that".  I love the food here and the people! They are very nice and after you've been there a couple of times, they remember you.  Even when placing a phone order!  I have the house chicken, which is FANTASTIC! It is spicy but not so much that you can't even enjoy it.  They give you big portions, so one lunch special for $5.00 is enough for 2 servings.  $2.50 a serving?!? You can't beat that.  I can't really say anything about the oiliness of the food, since I do not find mine to be oily at all.  The food ALWAYS comes out HOT!  Some much so, that it can not be eaten right away. Never have I gotten my food in 2 seconds as one reviewer did and I eat there often.  If you are looking for good food that is not over priced and just want to eat and not worry about all the decor and what not, then you should give it a try!

Ordered take out for the first time. I got the Shrimp Tempura Roll, the Las Vegas Roll and the Salmon Sashimi. It cost around $29.00 which for the quality, I thought was a bit pricey. The sashimi was good but the rolls were not. The rice was very thick and gummy and lacked flavor. Each roll was covered heavily in sauce which I feel takes away from the great taste a roll can have. I only ate about 2 pieces from each roll because I just couldn't get past the texture of the rice. Service was great though. The staff was very friendly and I was greated right away. There was only one other couple in the whole place and this was around 5:30 pm so I would have thought there would be more customers. Even though they offer happy hour from open to close Monday through Thursday I don't think I will be returning any time soon.

Okay, so I finally went to P.F. Chang's and I'd have to say it was alright.  We went there for a work function so the bill was not something I had to worry about!  Which was uber nice because I tried a few things that I normally wouldn't buy myself. So here is a run down of what I had:  Appetizer: Tuna Tataki Crisp $9.95 ***** ~ This was very good! I am a sushi fanatic, so I really enjoyed this dish. It was Ahi tuna rare on a crispy wonton-topped with ahi, cucumber, and scallions in a citrus sesame soy sauce. It was very fresh! I feel it could have used a tad more on the citrus sesame soy sauce but other than that, fabulous!  Appetizer: Lettuce Wraps $7.95 * ~  I can honestly say that these wraps were not what I expected.  With all the hype I thought these were gonna blow my taste buds to smithereens! They did no such thing.  They were "okay" at best.  Not a lot of flavor in the meat filling at all. Will not be getting these again.  Dinner: Oolong Marinated Chilean Sea Bass $24.95 **** ~  This FISH was amazing! It was served in a ginger soy type broth with spinach.  While the fish was extraordinary, I felt there was way too much broth and it just made my spinach way to soggy and a bit on the salty side.  It would have been a 5 star dish with less of the broth.  Desert: Mudslide Cocktail $9.00 ***** ~ This deserved 5 stars! It was very yummy and it's alcohol! Win win!   While I enjoy the food, I felt it to be a bit over priced.  The wait staff was super nice and you never had to "search" for anyone.  Would I go here again? If it were another work function, yes.  Otherwise, probably not.

I love love LOVE this place! They have so much to choose from its hard to decide on just a few items. My boyfriend and I have been there twice so far. On our first visit we happen to get there during happy hour. Needless to say it was BUSY! I know a lot of people hate to go to restaurants when they are packed but not this girl! To me, it says a lot about the food! We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and started salavating as we picked out a few rolls. We decided on the Manhattan Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll, Las Vegas Roll, Soft Shrimp Hand Roll and one other that escapes me at the moment! Ha! Anyways, the Manhattan Roll was on point!!! Oh so good! The Soft Shell Crab Roll was amazing! Not fishy at all! I think my other half could have eaten a ton of those. The Las Vegas Roll was definitely different than you'd get at most sushi places. It had some sort of green sauce rather than the typical eel sauce. Because I am so use to the average Las Vegas roll, I was a bit taken back at first, but after each bite, I rather enjoyed it! Man I wish I could remember the other roll we had because it too was fantastic!  The second visit was not during happy hour. It was by far, not as busy. We sat at the bar as we usually do and was greated by Sean. This guy should be in comedy! He kept us entertained with his humor which was refreshing since most sushi chefs are so dang serious! On this day we ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Rose Royce Roll. I'm not even go into reviewing the Shrimp Tempura Roll. Don't get me wrong, it was delish! But I have to tell you about the Rose Royce Roll....can you say spicy? No.....spicy does no justice to this roll. Hot? Hmmm....no. Let's see...how about a nice subtle heat that turns into a punch in the throat like sneak attack from highly trained Ninjas! Yep that'll do! This roll was so delicious! Packed with fresh cut habenero, If you are a novice to hot food, you will never get through this roll! This thing had us both sweatin' to the oldies! But we loved it! Sean was gracious enough to let us try some jelly fish. The marinate was very tasty but the texture was like eating soft plastic. Very cartilage-y lol! The service was great! Never had to ask for drink refills since they were on top of that. We will definitely be back here. So far this is our "sushi place of choice".

***UPDATE*** I was craving this place so bad, I had my husband drive from Glendale for take out!!! If I could give this place 6 stars I would! Now get your magically delicious noodle butts to the WESTSIDE!!!!   ***Original Review*** We saw this place when we were at Lee's having Bahn Mi and we decided we were gonna try this place next. I am SO GLAD WE DID! This place makes their own noodles on site and I have to say they are the absolute best! We started out with the fried dumplings. These things were so big they could be a meal in itself. They were filled with well seasoned pork and served with a tangy vinegar soy sauce. I have a hard time with dumplings because most places seem to have a weird taste to the pork. They are not that way here. Very fresh!!! I had the Noodles with minced pork and it was amazing! My husband had the pan fried noodles with beef and XO sauce. Both dishes we rediculous!!! The noodles were just out of this world! And the portions are extremely large!!! No complaints here, since we now had leftovers. And living in Glendale makes it quite the trip but a trip I am happy to make!

As I sit here, I am so full and happily satisfied, all I want to do is lay down and chill! But, I had such great food tonight that I feel compelled to write this review.  My sister RAVED about this place so naturally I had to go and check it out.  And with her paying the bill, how could I lose! Win win for me!!!    So as we pulled up, it's a quaint little place off of Dobson.  It had about 3 tables that seat about 8 and about 6 booths or so.  It was very clean and not one ant in sight as previous reviewers had mentioned. I am hard to please when it comes to Thai food.  My mother is from Thailand and her cooking is phenomenal! I find that 98% of the Thai restaurants are too "Americanized".  Not here though! This is so much like my moms cooking that I am willing to drive the 50 miles/1 hour drive just to eat here.  While there were choices for the buffet, Joann (owner and chef) gladly cooks something fresh and tasty for you!  She will make it any level of hotness for you and even caters to the little ones with hot dogs or grilled cheese. So onto what we had for dinner....  Drink - Thai tea.  Sweet, creamy and the real thing!  Pad Thai - This is always a favorite for everyone, although not so much for me at other Thai restaurants because it is usually cooked with some weird pink sauce which should not be in Pad Thai (something you'd expect Sheriff Joe to serve in tent city).  But Joann knows what she is doing! This is the best Pad Thai I've ever had besides my moms.  It was very fresh with cool and crispy bean sprouts. YUM!  Lad Nah - I grew up on this dish.  It is very good! A yummy broth with thick noodles and beef! The broccoli was not soggy or sauce soaked, but crispy and fresh!  Curries - I had a few of the curries that were up at the buffet.  Spicy and good! It paired well with the steamed white rice.  They were rich in flavor and just the right amount of heat.  Spicy Chicken  - It was just fabulous! Spicy with layered flavors! So good with the steamed rice. It had that spice that kept you coming back for more!  Sweet Fried Shrimp - This was very tasty! Tempura fried shrimp with a sweet orange sauce.  And I'm not talking little tiny salad shrimp.  Good sized shrimp! More than you would expect from a buffet.  Desert - Sweet Sticky Rice with Banana and Coconut Pineapple Ice Cream! Need I say more.  As full as I was, I managed to eat this and enjoy every last bite.  The sticky rice was sweet and warm! Went well with the banana and ice cream.  A wonderful way to end a spectacular meal!  Joann, you are an amazing cook and a gracious hostess!  My family and I will definitely make the 1 hour drive to dine here again.  Thank you for the amazing food and wonderful service.  Although I sit here miserable because I am so darn full, I am happy, happy, happy!  And for those who are concerned about "ants" they have an A rating for their establishment.  The buffet was $9.99 per person and $1.99 for the Thai Tea.

I write this review as my boyfriend is next to me in a food coma! He just got back from a hiking trip and wanted a burger and fries. So I jumped on Yelp to see what we could find. After looking at a few places, we decided on Rocket Burger and Subs. When we walked through the door we were greated right away. Something I look for and think is very important. We were amazed at the soda selection! Some sodas I've haven't seen in YEARS! They even have Slush Puppies!!! What???? Yeppers, they sure do! We both decided on the birch beer. Sooooo good! I went simple and got a cheeseburger and fries. BF got a pastrami with cole slaw sandwich and fries. I have to agree with most on here and say the food here is outstanding! Very fresh and full of flavor. The fries were not greasy nor the burgers salty. And I for one do not use or like salt very much. I love how the skin was left on the fries! Very yummy! We will definitely be back when we have a craving for really good burgers and fries! Oh and if you check in on Yelp you get 10% off!!!

I really enjoy coming to this location! The staff is really friendly and they know what my usual is. I was worried when  Kelby (the original manager) was getting transferred that service just wouldn't be the same. I'm so glad I was wrong! Steven came in and took over with the same exceptional service that I'm used to getting! So Steven, Courtney, Iris, Devin, Taylor, and the rest of the staff, THANK YOU!

My boyfriend and I stopped in during happy hour on a Thursday. The happy hour menu was quite nice since it had lots to choose from. We had the Firecracker appetizers which we loved! Stuffed jalapeños lightly deep fried with a spicy sauce drizzled on top. Yum! We order the Las Vegas roll, Soft Shell Crab roll and the Red Bull Roll. The Red Bull roll was money! It had a smoky flavor to the meat and was just straight up delicious! The Las Vegas roll was your basic role that you can get at most sushi places. However the soft shell crab roll seemed a bit on the fishy side. By far not my favorite soft shell crab roll at this spot. Service was wonderful! When we sat at the bar we were served a small cucumber salad which was delicious and after our meal we were given a small fresh orange to clean our palates. Everybody was friendly and we would return to eat here again.
