We walked in on 6/3/2016 10 minutes before closing. The bartender (who was unbelievably drunk, slurring swaying, and red glassed over eyes) instructed us they had closed 50 minutes before. Meanwhile, 4 tables are sitting and a server is walking out with fresh made food.   This is not a mom and pop shop that closes when its slow. Their hours are until 10, the bartender simply didn't want to serve us when we would have been quick to order and quick to leave. Probably because he was drunk as can be, which is incredibly unprofessional, let alone illegal.  This double standard makes me never want to go there again. I don't care how amazing the view of the baseball field is, its not enough to bring me back.  Their are other options, like hard rock cafe.

Each time I've gone there I have waited at least 20 minutes in the fast food lane. Only to have cold food!!! Will never return.   Unacceptable.

I wouldn't recommend anyone else!! I researched pest control options for a few days before I called Bulwark. They had such outstanding reviews on Yelp and they are live up to the hype. They offer a guarantee for their services and they fulfill! We've had to do several call backs because we were having a serious cricket/earwig/scorpion issue. I even had them come set up termite prevention since we just bought our home and would like to protect our new investment. Landon (termite), Jason G., Lance, and Blake have all been outstanding, pleasant, friendly, and informative.   Like I said we just moved in to our new home and immediately began having tons of crickets. My wife was also freaked out about scorpions. The first round nearly stopped the army but we felt after a week or so to do a call back. Bulwark without hesitation was HAPPY to do so. There was no sound of inconvenience or bother in their representatives voice. This has been consistent with all the call backs. They haven't tried to up-sell me at all and I have not incurred any extra cost. I have a strong peace of mind having Bulwark as my pest protectors to my home!

DO NOT, FOR ANY REASON USE THIS COMPANY! There are other options I emplower you to use them. This company is a nightmare. My family had a shower lever break and left the water ON. I was forced to turn the main water off to the house. A family without water is certainly an emergency. I called our home warranty who gave us this contractor. I called Do It Right Plumbing within 45 minutes of my work order to try to schedule an appointment ASAP. This is supposed to be a 24/7 company who handles emergencies. I called 2 times within an hour and couldn't reach them so I left a message. I waited another hour and finally got a hold of their unbelievably rude representative Linda. She said she would look up the order and call me back. An hour later, nothing. So I returned my call in which she rudely and aggressively told me she knows my situation. got my message,  was working on scheduling, and would call me back. I GOT NO CALL ALL DAY! This company BLATANTLY ignored a family with an urgent need. This was an immediate red flag! I immediately looked this company up online and saw multiple similar reviews. I called my home warranty and requested a change in contractor. I am so thankful I saw the signs. The new company Gecko, came out promptly and handle my situation with SERVICE and QUALITY.   I will never allow someone to provide me a service who doesn't have any sense of empathy, attentiveness, service, or compassion towards it's clients. There are always other options and someone who is working hard to provide for themselves and family. Someone who appreciates the work.
