Broken grill and poor service.   We drove here all the way from central Phoenix belated on the Yelp reviews.   When we got here, there were other patrons waiting in the TINY wait area by the front door and the hostess didn't show up for over 10 minutes, even though there were 4 groups of people by now.   We order the BBQ combo for 2, and a quarter of the way into grilling, the grill breaks. They offer to move us to another table, or fix the one we have.   Are they going to work in repairing it while we're sitting here? Are you kidding? We asked that they grill the food in the kitchen, since other people seem to be having grill issues as well.   15 minutes later, and after asking the waitress what's going on, they FINALLY bring out the BBQ.   it's chopped up meat that cooks in 2 minutes!   This place is off my list. Not worth the time or money.

please do NOT visit this restaurant if you're looking for spicy tuna, dragon, or any such other standard sushi fare.  This is not your typical sushi restaurant, but a place where, (happily) not many people seem to go, because they haven't discovered it yet.  I had no idea this place existed.  I've driven by the shopping center at 43rd Ave & Indian School Rd at least twice a week, and if it wasn't for a Groupon deal, I would have missed out on what is now a weekly must-visit for me.  They could chuck the entire menu in the garbage, and only serve the following fusion rolls, and I would be VERY happy to gorge myself at EVERY visit:   GUAMUCHILITO, CIELO MAR Y TIERRA, TRES QUESOS, CORDON BLEU  there's only ONE word to describe the sushi at this place: A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!  A word of caution: if you don't like deep-fried sushi, then avoid these rolls.  I LOVE the crunch texture and that's why they're my favorite.  Also, the portions are ENORMOUS.  one two rolls can feed two people without the need for appetizers, or dessert.  Make sure you go on an empty stomach, and you will be rewarded.

great happy hour appetizers, for the most part.  Not a fan of the orange chicken or the almond chicken.  I find them kind of dry.  LOVE the other appetizers.  Pork gyoza, or the chicken "wings" (drumsticks) are also very good, and the pineapple fried rice is always YUMMY.

Not a place I would go again.  it took almost 40 minutes for the server to bring a dried-out piece of lime for my water.  the food was meh, nothing special, unless you order the kimchi fried rice, which my friend did.  If I ever wondered what zombie guts from The Walking Dead must taste like, then it's probably this dish.  the "aroma" made me want to puke.  Thanks, but no thanks.

RUDY was AWESOME!!! Even though he's the assistant department manager, he took the time to understand my needs and helped me to pick out the best tiles and supplies for my project.   The ENTIRE staff made the buying process EASY!!!!
