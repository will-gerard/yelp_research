Old Spaghetti Factory: the place where fat suburbanites bring their fat children to eat fatty, salty and bland pasta.  The parking lot is a Camry convention and the client√®le is as white as the bread that they serve with your meals.  On the plus side, kids love the trolley and they get to ring the bell when they finish eating.  Always good motivation.

An Italian sub shop with an Irish name, you gotta like that.  The subs are very tasty as well as affordable and the service is fast and friendly.  The location  is a bit odd and the parking lot might eat your car but the dining area is unique and pleasant.  I have been a few times and will continue frequenting when I'm in the area.

Really great food, really terrible ambience. I recommend getting it to go because sitting down to eat will just depress you.   When we walked in I thought that the place was under construction as it was nearly empty, consisting only of a few cheap table on a concrete floor. No music, no tv, nothing on the walls. It was nearly empty and nearly silent, not a good first sign.  Despite this poor first impression we decided to stay and eat. I am very glad that I decided to give the place a second chance because the food is both tasty and reasonably priced. Their chicken is well seasoned and moist so get that.  Pros: Good food, good prices  Cons: Order at the counter, zero ambience

I bring my dog in monthly for shots and I have never once had an appointment reminder.  To top it off, I always spend at least an hour and usually closer to two waiting.  The last time I was in, my appointment was delayed by over an hour.  That is not acceptable and if there was another vet in my area I would be jumping ship.  Please Alta Vista, get your shit together.

If you love your "Mexican" food overflowing with cheese and sour cream then this is the place for you. The service was quite possibly the best that I have ever had and the food came out promptly and was delicious. The dining room is a throwback to 2001 with Dbacks championship memorabilia taking up most of the space. Eat here, just not too often or you'll get really fat.

While it's nearly next door to Z Pizza it couldn't be farther from what they offer.  The pizza is New York style and is a nice change from the anemic California style offered at Z Pizza.  They offer calzone and I'm a huge fan.

Oh this hurts.  I was so very excited to check out Da Vang as I am a Vietnamese food nut and have longed to find a decent joint here in the valley. Da Vang is not that place.  Let me clear this up first. When I say that I'm a Vietnamese food nut I am not joking. I used to eat Vietnamese two or three times a week, there were eight (!) Vietnamese restaurants within a block of my house back home, my best friend is Vietnamese and his mother and sister cook for me when I go back for a visit. I know my Bun from my Banh, Pho realz.  Let's start with the good. The Bun was indeed tasty, well prepared and inexpensive like Bun should be.  Now for the bad. The service was terrible, they were out of bbq pork, they mixed up the salt and sugar in my drink (a briny drink is not where it's at, fyi) and their Banh Xeo was an abomination that likely would have begged for death if it could speak.  I wish that I could say that I had found my Vietnamese oasis in the dull and bland desert but I have not. My search continues and so should yours.

The subs are worthy of a four (long way from a five I'm afraid) but the lychee smoothie deserves an 11.  My goodness that is one tasty drink.  I could drink them all day every day.  Go enjoy a sub and try not to cream in your pants when you taste the smoothie.  Seriously, they're that good.

I take my boys here nearly every week and they LOVE it. Great big park with plenty of room to run, loads of other dogs to play with and many of tennis balls to fetch.  Water stations at both ends of the park ensure that dogs get enough to drink and good owners ensure that I don't step in anything.

This is one of those reviews where a qualifier is required.  It seems like everybody that gives this transit system a good rating is a Phoenix native.  That makes this, like so many other things, good for Phoenix.  The problem is that it's terrible compared to nearly every other metro system in North America and absolutely abysmal compared to more progressive parts of the world.  This is quite possible the slowest train that I have ever ridden in my life.  It seems to make stops every two blocks and it take far too long to get anywhere.  Factor in the terrible hours of operation and you're going to easily find yourself stranded at one end or the other after a night at the bar.  Please work on expanding the routes and hours, speeding up the trains and then maybe you'll be able to increase ridership.  I'm a huge fan of mass transit but this train falls far short of expectations.

I'm updating my review with an awesome story and question.  I last visited Revolver in May during my First Friday wanderings.  I found myself a cool old Prince 12" and didn't think too much about it, until I put it on.  Sweet jeebus this was dirty - I swear that someone was actually having sex in the background.  It made Controversy sound like Pat Boone and it was AWESOME.  I am so thankful that I stumbled across this rare gem in amongst the stacks of musty vinyl at Revolver.  So now I ask you, where else but in the crates can you find that kind of experience?  It's certainly not found in the iTunes store.  Support the cool local record stores kids, before they're all gone and the government forces us all to listen to Justin Bieber.

Hair Pollution is a super funky salon located in a pretty shitty part of town. I've driven by almost daily for the past year and a half and always wondered what such a cool looking place was doing here.  I desperately needed a haircut and decided to finally satisfy my curiosity. I called in the early afternoon on a Monday and they were able to get me in later that afternoon. That in itself is worth a bonus star - open Monday AND able to fit you in? Win.  I was assigned a stylist at random and wasn't sure what to expect. I'm feeling very lucky now that Samantha cut my hair because she did a great job and I feel great about how it looks.  She took her time to talk to me about what I wanted, what she could do and helped me plan for future cuts.  The best part of the whole experience was that a super good haircut was only $35. I've paid far more at other salons but never actually gotten anything for that extra expense. I am now a Hair Pollution fan and will be seeing Samantha for all my cuts. You should too!

I made the mistake of revisiting 1130 for lunch yesterday and immediately regretted it.  Bloody Marys were on special so we ordered up a round.  Big mistake.  They were chunky and revolting - mine went back.  I ordered the turkey burger and my companion had the salmon sandwich.  After a wait that was infinitely too long we received our rather sad looking meals.  My turkey burger came completely dry and solo on a squished and soggy bun.  It was obviously a frozen patty and not from a reputable brand either.  My fries were even worse as they were both undercooked and greasy at the same time.  My companion's salmon sandwich was overcooked and served with rancid looking lettuce.  Not a good way to earn our favor.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.

Oh yeah, the pizza itself is so good that you will definitely overeat.

I'm upgrading it by one star because while they have a very limited selection what is available is of stellar quality and flavor. I can't give them a full five though because they use the WORST SPOONS EVER. Seriously, they're so weak and flexible that you can't scoop your ice cream with them. What good is that? Get some proper spoons and you may revel in your five star glory. Until then, feel shame for your cheapness.

It's also a great excuse for getting drunk in public on a weeknight. WAKA does a great job of organizing and works out amazing deals with the sponsor bars. The fees for the season are reasonable and the amount of fun that you will have is limitless.

I finally made it up here last Friday night and was pleasantly surprised.  From the outside it looks like exactly the kind of place I avoid, it screams douchebag central, but on the inside it's open and airy and pleasant.  They have a "patio" in the back part of the restaurant the while totally enclosed gives the impression of being outside - perfect for Phoenix.  Because it was a Friday night they had a DJ spinning friendly down tempo stuff that didn't intrude on our conversation.  Nicely done.  The nachos with tandoori chicken were excellent and more than enough for two adults.  The service was quick and polite.  There were many food options for late night (we were there after 11pm) and the prices were reasonable.  Now for the bad.  The beer selection was rather weak and they clearly don't serve a lot of Hoegaarden as it came in a regular pint glass.  That is unacceptable.  If they can figure out how to serve beer then they'll have a very good thing going.
