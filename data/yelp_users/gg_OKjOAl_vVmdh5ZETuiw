Ci!  Comedor Guadalajara is a place that seems to always come up when discussing Phoenix Mexican food.  I finally found myself in the area and dropped by for early lunch and was not disappointed.  To the tourists and over cautious it may not look like the best area to be but have no worries.  This part of town is just old and run down.  You won't be knifed in the parking lot and there's even a security guard keeping an eye on the lot.  Have no fears.  As per usual when I hit a Mexican place I ordered the enchilada's.  The appetizer was the standard free house chips and salsa.  Oh, boy!  The salsa!  I always complain that the salsa in not hot enough (even at Mexican places) but one bite here and there was a temporary spice assault upon my eyes and nose.  Both started to run and I loved every minute.  When your body reacts, you know you're eating good salsa.  My Pepsi came soon after wards and it was the largest drink I've ever been served save for a liter of beer I had at a German tavern in New York City.  My food arrived soon after wards and it was served on a scorching hot plate.  Everything was delicious and I think they make their own refried beans.  Possibly the best beans I've had at a Mexican place.  The dining area is larger than a fast food joint but smaller than your typical restaurant.  Not long after I arrived it started to fill up quickly.  Expect to wait a few minutes at peak times.  Sadly this structure was an impenetrable fortress for my phone and I was unable to officially do a Yelp check in but, eh, I cannot hold that against the Comedor.  I'd like to note that quite a few of the patrons were Hispanic and that, to me, is always a good sign when eating at a Mexican joint.  I have been waiting to find a Mexican restaurant that I can officially dub as the best I've had.  I am confident I can dub thee, Comedor Guadalajara, as the best I have had.  Can't wait to take any visitors I have here.

Good eats.  My food was just short of epic.  The beef sandwich was delicious and the pork ribs were fantastic.  The ribs are not skimpy on the meat and it comes right off the bone.  Loved the sauce, very tangy and has a good kick.  I arrived just before the lunch crowd began to pick up.  Looks like it can get a bit hectic when large crowds come due to all the people swarmed around the small counter ordering and picking up their meals.

Great food at a great price.  I ordered three carne asada tacos that came with sides of beans and rice with a medium drink.  My grand total came out to $5.95. I've spend $2-3 more for the same meal at Filiberto's across the street.  The beans and rice were quality.  I've stated before in a review for another restaurant that the quality of the beans and rice can make all the difference.  Many places are generally the same when it comes to the main event of the meal but so many places serve lackluster beans and rice.  Tacos Mexico does not.  Everything about the meal is quality.  The salsa is legit.  Very hot.  So much so that they have a sign warning people.  It's not too hot for seasoned salsa veterans but for the average, um, white person it might pack a wee bit of a wallop.  It must be authentic style salsa.  I've noticed that some places serve salsa that has a very earthy or natural taste (maybe even bitter).  I'm not sure if that's the best way to describe it but it's almost as if hot peppers were blended or pureed with nothing added.  Bottom line, this stuff is hot and fantastic.

Today I finally made it to George & Dragon.  I was in a pinch and looking for a place that had Telefutera so I could watch my favorite soccer team (Chicago Fire) play.  I called George & Dragon and was told they could accommodate.  One packed light rail ride later I was there and ready to get my game and drink on.  George & Dragon is my type of place.  The decor has been described by other Yelpers as very British.  Since I have not been the the UK, I cannot attest to that but it does look like what I think a British pub should look like.  It actually reminded me of the Winchester in Shaun of the Dead.  The football scarves are always a nice touch.  Perhaps one day I'll donate a USA or Fire scarf and see if they put it up among the UK clubs scarves.  The beer selection was not as good as I had hoped it would be but it's still better than most. Today I was in the mood to drink German despite being in a British pub so I opted to drink Spaten.    For lunch I ordered the Shepherds Pie and it was amazing.  It's the third different shepherds pie I've had in metro Phoenix and it might be the best one.  My team lost an ugly one and it spoiled my day a bit but I was happy to have made my first visit to George & Dragon.  It will not be my last.  With easy access to light rail I plan on being back soon.  Cheers!

Kosher alert!  I ordered a pizza sub with pepperoni and was met with weird looks.  Did not realize I was in a kosher eatery.  Oh, well.  It made for an interesting Christmas Eve dining adventure.  The pizza sub was fantastic.  Made with fresh mozzarella, bread and sauce made in house.  The sauce made the sub.  Good sauce always stands out and these folks have one of the best sauces around.  I can't wait to try the pie one day.  I am partial to slaughtered animal on my pizza but I am willing to do without.  Service was a bit slow but that is to be expected when your food is made fresh.  A good meal is always worth a wait.

Samurai Comics is a good shop.  You'll find all of the latest titles and they have a decent back issue collection as well.  The graphic novel and trade selection is impressive and they support local work too.  My visit on Saturday yielded a local book called La Mano del Destino by Jason Gonzalez that I had never heard of before.    I've only been here 2 years and seldom purchase comics anymore so I cannot attest to how Samurai Comics stacks up against other stores (I'd say they're on par with Ash Comics in Tempe) but the place impresses me and is probably one of the better shops I've been to and they rival Graham Crackers from Chicagoland.  If you've just moved from the Chicago area and miss Graham Crackers, then I'd suggest a visit to Samurai Comics.  Samurai Comics will be my "go to" place when I get the craving for comics.

I had the lamb souvlaki pita and it was fantastic.  Plenty of toppings and the tzatziki sauce was superb.  Best of all was the lamb cubes: generous portion of meaty chunks.  Some places skimp of the toppings and meat and leave much to be desired but Cyprus Grill gives you the bang for your buck.  On the night I was here there must have been a call off or two as one woman was left to operate the cash register and serve the tables.  There was a wait but this lady handled it like a champ and kept her composure.  My friend said this place is typically staffed well so the longer wait was not the norm.  Props to this gal for taking it all in stride.  I was also impressed with the tropical tea they served.  It had passion fruit or some other tropical fruit that I'd never expect to find in tea but it was very good and refreshing after spending the day out in the sun.  Cozy restaurant in the Town & Country Mall at 20th St & Camelback.  I will be back.

I am a bit surprised at how many people refer to Ice House Tavern as a "dive".  It is not a "dive" in the true or hipster sense.  A "dive" does not have 6 flat panel television sets, a disc jukebox stocked with local music & a modern internet connected jukebox, a mean pulled pork sandwich or a great selection of booze.  It may be old (by Phoenix standards) but it's no "dive".  Ice House Tavern is one of the best bars I've been to.  Period.  Unique to boot.  It's attached to an ice rink.  While I was there a range from mites to juniors were practicing on the ice.  I was even treated to watching a Phoenix Roadrunners Zamboni resurface the ice between sessions.  As the practices died down the bar began to fill with hockey people.  It was amazing.  I was able to watch a Red Wings game with sound at a bar in Phoenix.    According to a calendar of events posted by the door there is also dart tournaments, local comedy and bands.  I think they get punk shows.  I found out, after the fact, that a few friends have attended shows there.    The beer selection was most impressive.  Have your pick of cheap swill or tenderly crafted micro brews.  A delicious pulled pork sandwich is the only proper eats offered.  If pulled pork isn't your thing you'll have to settle for snacks: Corn Nuts, Slim Jim and various candies.  Great service too.  Ice House Tavern is a must and I look forward to future visits and, perhaps, the opportunity to explore events that happen here.  I know I have found a home to watch hockey games.

El Bravo has a typical menu with the regular items you expect to find at a Mexican restaurant.  The success of El Bravo is the quality of the food and their ability to put a distinct mark on Mexican standards.    I ordered the #6: Chicken Tamale Deluxe Combo that included a shredded beef flauta, ground beef taco (with flour shell), chicken tamale with rice and beans.  The flauta and tamale were fantastic.  The green sauce on the tamale top notch.  The flower taco shell was an interesting experience.  It's the first I've had in the style offered at El Bravo.  I prefer the standard corn shell (also offered at El Bravo) but it made for a nice deviation from my typical taco experience.   My order took longer than I would typically expect but worth the wait.  El Bravo has a smaller staff and all the food is prepared fresh when you order.  This isn't assembly line style cooking.  You can even look into the kitchen from the counter and watch the magic happen.    The dining area is of ample size and fit for the solo diner or families.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly and attentive.  Overall, I can say that El Bravo is one of the best restaurants, Mexican or otherwise, in Phoenix.

I moved from Tempe to North Phoenix a month ago.  Aside from access to light rail the one thing I had been missing most was access to great Mediterranean food.  I'm always game for a good kebab or falafel sandwich.  A coworker mentioned Saba's and I was there just a few days later.  I stopped in after work and picked up dinner for me and the roommate.  The place was busy and almost filled to capacity.  Saba's is one of the places that lacks width but stretches back kind of far.  Looked a bit cramped but I can handle that style of seating for good food.  The waiters brought out plates of flaming dishes and yelled "OPAH!" each time.  Not sure if anyone working there was actually Greek but it makes for a good show and adds some to the atmosphere of the place.  My order for two was ready to go in about 5 minutes (not too fast or slow).  I was out the door and headed to home with the fantastic aroma of sheesh kebab sandwich filing my auto.  My roommate had the Rolled Baba sandwich, a veggie dish made with baba ghannouj.  She liked it a lot but I didn't try it so I'll take her word for it.  I had the lamb sheesh pita.  It was served with an ample portion of delicious meat and they were generous with the veggie toppings and yogurt sauce.  Fantastic sandwich.  The menu has a fine selection sides, salads, burgers, sandwiches and entrees.  They serve Greek beer and I think they have one from the Middle East as well.  One day, sooner than later, I'll venture back and dine in (even if it's a bit crowded) and take in the atmosphere and a great meal.  Saba's was very impressive all around.  It's on par with my two favorite locations in Tempe.  This place will be getting a lot of my eating out money.  If it wasn't for other favorite kebab locations in New York City, Philadelphia and Toronto that were a tad better I likely would have given Saba's a solid 5 stars.  It was that good.  Can't wait to go back.

It had been years since I played a round of mini golf.  I had been to Metro Mall a few times but payed not attention to the attraction sharing a parking lot.  Word of mouth was not very good and the place was described as "ghetto Six Flags" a few times.  It came up, however, in a discussion about mini golf and was told they had a nice course.  I rounded up two friends and we gave it a whirl.  We played course one and had a great time.  Many of the holes were similar but it was still fun and at times frustrating (which always adds to the experience).   Afterward I scoped out the arcade.  If you love pinball you need to check this place out.  Castles-n-Coasters has the biggest selection I have seen in one place.  They also had a nice collection of newer and older arcade games.  X-Men and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were the standouts.  Great memories playing those games as a kid.  The rides looked like typical carnival type and mostly for kids (not shocking).  I'm content with the mini golf and arcade.  I will be back.

Last summer I had my first sonoran dog down in Tucson.  Last night I stumbled upon Micky's right here on Yelp and was psyched that sonoran dogs were to be found in my area.  Micky's is a small joint that sells dogs and Mexican food and it's all cheap.  I ordered two sonoran dogs, paid and took my receipt outside to the man at the patio grill where he cooked up my dogs.  Delicious...just like the ones I had in Tucson.  I cannot wait to go back.  These small joints are always the best.  Viva Micky's!

Old and dingy burger stand gracing a part of town many folks would care not to venture over to.  The menu has a variety of options from burgers to wings to Mexican food.  Prices are cheap.  For under $6 I was able to get two cheeseburgers, a large sack of fries and a gigantic Dr. Pepper.  Great cheap eats.  Old school at its finest.  Don't expect anything fancy.  Even the trash cans are old.  If you're worried about the location just drop by during the day (though I don't think the night time would be any different).  My visit was void of the colorful characters mentioned in the other reviews.  At the end of the day Jimmy Jack's is better than any McDonald's or Burger King.  Give a local establishment a shot.  I shall return.

Today I took a trip to The Fry Bread House for my first taste of the famous bread.  Until just a few days back I had thought fry bread was a desert much like an elephant ear or funnel cake.  I had no idea it was used as the base for a meal (they do offer desert varieties too).  For lunch I had an Indian Taco with green chili beef, beans, cheese and the normal taco fixings only it was served on fry bread as opposed to a tortilla. The taco was tasty and the portion was large.  I paid $5 or $6 and it was well worth it.  Just think about the money that can be spent at any fast food joint and the Indian Taco becomes an even better deal.  Service was easy and fast.  I ordered, picked up my drink, grabbed a paper towel and sat down.  By the time I checked in my name was called and my taco was waiting.    I was very impressed with The Fry Bread House and I will be returning.

I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.  The buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items (no white rice).  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.  China Garden has, hands down, the worst eggroll I've eaten.  Given the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.  One guy at the cashier even commented that he'd been coming since 1970.  I don't get it.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at.  The staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food.

Love it.  Last night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.  Glad I did.  It's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.    When I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.  I also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.  Right here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever.  I cannot wait to return.  I only open they were open past 6pm.

Silver Cinemas is a favorite film destination of mine.  Given the current ticket prices for first run features, I don't frequent the cinema as much as I once did.  The $3 ticket price is a fantastic bargain.  The place has a retro feel.  A friend taking me here for the first time said it "looks like a spaceship inside".  Walking down the theater corridor there is definitely a Star Trek feel and I really dig that.  There's a good assortment of arcade games to keep you occupied if you have time to kill.  They have The Simpson's (one of the most difficult games ever made for the arcade) but something is wrong with the screen and it's too dark.  They also have a cabinet with a wide selection of Atari classics.  Concessions are pricey as with the first run theaters.  I'm not going to hold that against them.  They need to make money somewhere.  The worst I can offer about Silver Cinemas is the seats.  Not the most comfortable and I typically shuffle around a bit but for $3, I'll deal with it.

Ah, Texano's.  It's not always the cleanest place (I've seen the trash overflowing on a few visits) but the food is always good.  The dining area isn't the biggest but they offer outdoor seating as well and I'm fairly certain most come for takeout.  Finding seating should never be an issue.  At times the table may need a scrubbing but I generally look past that.  There's a jukebox stocked with mariachi music.  Most times it's silent but when it's on the mariachi is blasting.  Distracting for some, no doubt, but I always get a kick out of it.  Typically a song pops up after I order and sit down to wait for my meal.  The timing is such that it's almost playing in celebration of my patronage.  I have never been less than satisfied with the food at Texano's.  Typically I order the California burrito but I've also had the Oaxaca burrito and enchilada's.  The menu consists of typical fast food Mexican and is virtually identical to Filiberto's .  With the exception of the standard taco, I prefer everything from Texano's over Filiberto's.    One week I must have eaten here 3-4 days in a row.  I would on a regular basis if I had the money to eat out as often as I would like to.  Texano's might be my favorite Mexican joint in Tempe, possibly even my favorite Tempe restaurant in general.  Be sure to try the house spicy guacamole sauce.  This stuff is delicious and actually spicy (that will always impress me).  The sauce, however, has been out a few times when I went late night or early morning.  I think they make a supply for each day and let the customers partake on a first-come, first-served basis.

There's a reason why Yelpers are singing praise for Haji-Baba.  The few skeptics must have not taste for good food or must come from Middle Eastern families and hate anything not cooked by their mothers and grandmothers.  Haji-Baba is one of the better Middle Eastern eateries I have had the pleasure to try.  Not just in Tempe but anywhere (including NYC and Toronto).  I had the shish kebab plate that included generous portions of rice and salad along with the chunks of lamb.  It came with a pita slice too.    It's an unorthodox place.  You're given a ticket that you present to the cashier.  Anything you may purchase from the grocery side will be added.  If you cook you might enjoy the wide variety of spices and other items for sale.  They even sell a few edibles from Croatia and Serbia.  Be sure to try the baklava.  They have a few varieties.  I tried the Queen Baklava and it was fantastic.  One of the best I've had.

Since I moved to Tempe I have had no luck finding a regular place for a haircut.  One place in Mesa closed after two visits, one place charged me $17 and the other place never opens on time.  After waiting for 30 minutes I pulled out the droid and searched for another barbershop and opted to try Ray's.  Glad I did.  I'm not hard to please.  My cuts are always simple buzz cuts.  Ray's had a lot more to offer in terms of atmosphere.  The barbers were nice and the locals hanging out waiting for their services made the trip worthwhile.  We talked about baseball, the weather and local Mexican food joints.  Ray's ASU Barber Shop is one of those places that make going to the barber a cultural experience.  I will be going here from now on.

Dropped by Dazzo's before a hockey game the other night.  I heard good things and had read about that car that crashed into the wall forcing the dining area to close for some time.  After a long wait I was finally here and I was not disappointed.  Initially, I had gone in for a hot dog but ended up ordering the Italian Beef sandwich.  I spent 10 years in Chicagoland and the Italian beef sandwich has been one of the things I miss most aside from friends.  The owners son, working the counter, told me flat out they had a great beef sandwich.  That was enough for me.    As my order was in the works I chatted with the owners son and another guy working.  We talked hockey, hot dogs and about the car wreck that destroyed the wall.  Great, friendly people.  When my food was ready I sat down and dug in.  The beef sandwich was great an on par with those I had in Chicago.  It was made just right, the juice was tasty and the beef and bread were great.  The hot peppers made a great touch (you can also go for sweet peppers or none at all).  Dazzo's makes good fries too.  Dazzo's is a fantastic mom and pop restaurant.  The food is great and the workers are friendly.  You can't go wrong.  Dazzo's is a must.  Put Dazzo's on your "to do" list if you have not been here before.  I will back.  No doubt.

I was here from 8pm to 11:30pm on a Saturday night.  The joint was crowded and mostly mid 30s on up with a few younger scattered in.  A local cover band was playing.  They were terrible but most seemed too drunk or too busy dancing to care.  Service was slow, slow, slow.  I've never waiting so long for one beer.  No one was rude but there's no excuse for the lack of promptness.  It was busy, yes, but I've seen places just as or more busy and had an easier time getting drinks.  I tried the nachos and enchiladas.  The nachos were really good but the enchiladas were mediocre.  Better than what I could make on my own but you'll find better at any restaurant.  Cocomo Joe's has a lot of televisions and I was able to watch the Coyotes game.  It seems like it could be a good location to watch football on Sunday.  I'm guessing the atmosphere is decidedly different during the day than at night.  During the day it's probably a decent place to catch a game.  If I'm invited back on a Saturday night, I will pass.

Romen's was not terrible but easily the worst kebab/gyro that I have ever paid for.    My order took some time so I was expecting a delicious meal as I've found that great food often comes with a longer wait.  Instead I was treated to a small portion of bland meat, skimpy toppings and light on the sauce.    I've paid less for more food and have had better kebab/gyro sandwiches at many places.    It's a haul for anyone up in the Sun City/Surprise area but if you want a great Middle Eastern/Mediterrainian sandwich (or food in general) take a trip across Apache Blvd in Tempe and stop at one of the 5 or 6 places between Mill and McClintock.  They will not disappoint.

La Flor De Michoacan was a great Yelp find.  I found myself in at the high school across the street attending a soccer game.  This place popped up on my Yelp app and I dropped by after the game.  Glad I did.  This is a Mexican restaurant that offers up a typical fast food style menu plus some additional things I'm not familiar with.  You're bound to find something to your taste on the menu.  They also sell hand dipped ice cream and other snack items.    I ordered the No. 1 combo, beef taco and enchilada (my go-to Mexican meal).  My food arrived promptly on a plate instead of the typical Styrofoam carton.  The presentation was nice: two tortilla chips were sticking out of the beans and the lettuce and tomato were on the side as opposed to on top.  They also placed a piece of wax paper under the taco so the the sauce wouldn't soak in.  Brilliant move!  La Flor De Michoacan is the only place I've been to that does this.  Anywhere else I have to gobble the taco so it does not get soggy.  I topped the taco off with the house salsa.  Good eats!  The dining area was clean and tidy and a step above what most will expect from a local Mexican joint.  It's fitting to dine in with others or family.  I eagerly look forward to the next Phoenix Monsoon game as I know I have found the place I will eat at after the games.

Penn & Teller are amazing and this show is fantastic.  I've been a fan for many years.  I remember their movie Penn & Teller Get Killed.  I watched their show Bullsh!t.  On my first trip to Las Vegas I finally had the opportunity to see them live.  The show runs roughly 90 minutes.  Many of the acts require a participant from the audience.  If I recall properly they all left with a token of some kind from their time on stage.  They even show you how a few of the tricks are done.    After the show Penn & Teller hang around outside the auditorium to sign any swag you have and take pictures.  You might even get to hear Teller speak!  I was at the show this past Sunday (May 6, 2012) following the conclusion of the Libertarian National Convention.  It made the show all the more special because Penn & Teller are fellow libertarians and make several references to their beliefs during the show.  At the gift stand you can even purchase our beloved Bill of Rights on a little metal plate you can take to airports and whip TSA into a frenzy.    The price of admission was nearly $100.  No small sum to me but well worth it at the end of the day.  Even the under $25k per year crowd deserves some fun.  If you enjoy comedy and magicians without all the pretentious b.s. you will have a blast with Penn & Teller.

I love Bookmans.  It's one of the best sources for used media that I have ever been too.  Overall, it might be the best.  I've never seen a better selection of books, records, Cd's, video games and magazines in one place.  You'll even find collectibles and cassette tapes.    The Mesa location has the benefit of the cafe with wifi but I do like the Phoenix location a bit better.  I've made better scores here and the DVD selection is more impressive.  Don't let that detract from the Mesa store, however, as it still has much to offer and is still an awesome place.  A trip to both stores would make for a fun day browsing used books and records.

Wunderbar!  This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in metro Phoenix.  I've been there 3 times now and have loved each visit.  On two of the visits I sat at the patio area.  On both nights it was chilly but they keep propane heaters going that really warm the place up (you might not want to sit too close to them as they give off a lot of heat) the other time I sat at the bar watched a game whilst drinking German beer and eating a giant Bavarian pretzel.  Haus Murphy's has great atmosphere and darn good food.  The above mentioned pretzel is a must and goes great with the German mustard.  Their mustard has a great kick and will clear any nasal passage.  As far as the entrees I have had the sauerbraten and the schweinebraten and enjoyed both.  The German beer selection tops anything I've seen in Phoenix thus far.  I recommend the Konig Ludwig Hefeweizen.  Service was great every visit.  Kudos to the manager who dealt with a fussy customer at the table across from mine during my last visit.  She took it all in stride and didn't let if phase her one bit.  Very professional even when being wronged.  I can't praise them enough.  I'd give them 5 stars but I've been to a German restaurant elsewhere that was better (no fault to Haus Murphy's, the other place is that amazing).  It's especially nice this time of year since you can sit out on the patio and take in the Glendale Glitters while enjoying a great meal.

Stinkweeds is a great local shop.  You will find a larger selection of music at other local (and larger) shops but Stinkweeds is well worth a visit.  The used vinyl and CD selection is decent and they're happy to order anything they can for you.    This is a must stop, along with Revolver, if you purchase vinyl and/or your musical taste runs deeper than Lady Gaga, Katy Perry or Green Day.    Stop by if only to possibly expand your musical horizons or to keep your hard earned dollars circulating in the local Phoenix area economy.

This is the place to go if you're a soccer fan in Phoenix.  They'll show any game possible and are very accommodating.  They even let the America Outlaws (USMNT supporters) to use the extra room area to set up FIFA tournaments on PS3. Great times.  The beer selection is decent, service is good and I really like the food.  The hot wings are really good but they aren't actually hot.  Someone pointed out that should be expected as it's and English pub.  Our friends across the pond don't fancy the hot stuff, I guess.  Still very tasty and they will grill them too if that's how you like your wings.

I visit this restaurant with the same friend.  We get the same waitress and order the exact same thing: bulgogi and katsu, house selection of sides and Korean beer.  That's how I like it and I leave happy every time.  If you're a fan of sliced beef and breaded pork then order the above selections or find your favorite Korean dish.  The menu offers a wide variety of selections.  They serve at least 2 Korean beers (OB & Cass) and they're both worth trying out and each goes well with the food.  Just be aware of the booths in the center aisle.  The faux word/stone benches have these holes in them by design and it feels awkward if you end up sitting on one.  If you're going with an annoying friend or family member...make sure that's where they sit.

Monkey Pants was really dark, there were sombreros sitting here and there and there was a bulletin board across from where I was sitting covered with Polaroid photos (I assume victors of Burger Nation challenge they have).  The clientele appeared to be local regulars (always a good sign).  This is the only place I have ever been that offers 3 varieties of wings: fried, grilled or blackened.  I tried a hot grilled dozen.  The wings were very tasty but not hot by any means.  I'm not sure if my order was prepared wrong or if the grilling neutralizes the hotness a bit.  Either way the wings were very good so I have no real complaints.  It did take a bit for my wings to be served but the website did indicate that they employ only one cook and everything is made fresh.  I don't mind waiting for good eats.  The bar is large with ample seats at the bar and many tables.  If you're a sports fan they have television sets all over.  They don't all have the best picture but you won't miss any action.  There's a pool table, various arcade games and a jukebox (loaded with compact discs).    I dig Monkey Pants.  One day I shall return and inquire about the Burger Nation challenge.

Weaksauce.  The pizza was mediocre and had obviously been sitting awhile.  Two slices of pepperoni pie and a medium pop set me back nearly $10.  For that price I expect more.  Nothing special or notable about the pizza.  It's not horrible if you're strolling thru Arizona Center but don't go expecting much.  If you've devoured pie in NYC, skip it all together.

My first taste of boba was at an Asian market out in the West Valley.  Since that time I've found a few places closer to me that offer boba.  Boba Tea House is my favorite.  They offer a wide variety of flavors and most can be mixed.  I don't venture into paths unknown with my drinks and always grab a lychee snow with boba.    I've been impressed with each visit.  The only draw back is that I don't feel comfortable hanging out there.  If you're over 18 you will most likely be the oldest person in the joint.  Typically I drop by for a boba after shopping at the market next door and bail when my drink is ready.  I imagine it makes a good hangout place for a younger crowd.  The crowd won't deter me.  I will continue going to Boba Tea House for all my boba needs.

Johnnie's makes the best pizza I've had since moving to Phoenix.  I say this as someone biased against thin crust pies.  They have a distinct sauce that helps makes this a memorable pizza.  The decor is Chicago sports and culture centric.  If you're from The Windy City this is a place you need to check out.

I know, I know.  Why would I hit up a mall food court for Greek/Med style cuisine and expect it to deliver?  I was in the PV Mall, hungry and ready to eat and this appeared to be my best option.  I scanned the menu and went for the pork pita sandwich.  I was promptly informed that they did not serve pork.  I asked it they were out as pork was featured all over the menu.  I was then told they no longer serve pork.  A posted sign or an updated menu would work wonders.  No big deal so I order the beef/lamb combination.  The sandwich was made and then it sat behind the counter awaiting the fries.  After standing around about 5 minutes I was informed it would be a "few minutes" for the fries.  I expect fresh food and don't mind waiting a few minutes but why prep the sandwich this early when there was still a significant wait for the fries?  The fries were good but the sandwich was mediocre.  The pita tasted dry, perhaps even stale.  The meat and other fixings tasted generic.  Overall the food was okay but at nearly $10 for a sandwich, fries and drink there is no value to be had.    Update the menu, find more attentive staff and drop the prices a bit and this place could be a 3 star joint.  Mall court food will never be great quality but they can at least attempt to rise above food court mediocrity.

Revolver Records is my favorite music shop in Phoenix.  I have never left empty handed.  The vinyl selection is nice.  Mostly used but there's a decent selection of new vinyl as well.  The new arrivals bin always has something in to worth taking home.  You'll also find a good selection of used cd's and dvd's.  I don't always find a lot of what I'm looking for but most of the stock is generated from locals selling off their collection so it does reflect local music tastes.    Revolver is a good place to check if you're on the market for a turntable, receivers or speakers too.  They even have a small used book shelf that usually has some good stuff.  I walked away with a book about Robert Williams paintings on one of my last visits.  Revolver Records is a great local shop.  If you like buying vinyl or just checking out the local joints make sure you drop by here sometime.

I've been making trips to Tim Finnegans before I lived in Arizona.  On a past visit my friend brought me here.  It was a place me made trips to for the shepherds pie.  I had my first pie here and have now tried it many other places.  Tim Finnegans offers up the best and it's made with lamb (as opposed to beef in many places).  Always was it down with a pint of Strongbow or Magners.  It's a good bar for sports too.  There's always a soccer or football game on.  Man City swag is plentiful here.  Service is a bit slow from time to time but I can live with that.

Guerrero's is a fantastic mom 'n' pop place.  I drove past this place many times before I finally stopped in.  Glad I did.    The restaurant has a small dining area but most people seem to pick their orders up.  If you're looking to dine in you shouldn't have any problems.  When a small operation like this has been open for nearly 30 years you know it must be good.  Typically I order the enchiladas but as of late I've been going earlier in the morning and ordering from the breakfast menu.  Everything I have tried here has been great.  All items are reasonably priced too and the service is friendly.  Great little place.

Before today I had only one experience with Indian food.  It came in the form of an eating challenge in New York City.  It was fun but not very tasty and left me with a flaming mouth and weak bowels.  A friend wanted to try and Indian place in her neck of the woods.  I checked Yelp and saw that the reviews for this place were bad so I mentioned The Dhaba.  The reviews were good, I always wanted to try it and it's right across the street from my place.    Very happy we dropped by.  The restaurant was on the small side but had enough tables to accommodate anyone that dropped by.  The decor was nice and I especially liked the metal water glasses.  Very cool.  I ordered garlic naan and a lamb curry dish.  The naan was fantastic and the lamb was great.  The naan provided a great way to scoop up the excess curry.  For my beverage I selected a tasty Indian beer.  My friend ordered a veggie sandwich stuffed with potatoes that she really enjoyed.  She also ordered little bits of chicken tenders.  These were fantastic.  The breading was good and the chicken had a little kick.  If you check in you will get a free desert.  However I was not offered a choice.  It was mandatory rice pudding.  It's not what I wanted but since it was free I made no complaint.  I could take or leave the rice pudding.  Service was prompt and attentive.    Be prepared to spend some money.  The Dhaba isn't cheap.  Our bill came in just under $50.  It's not the type of place I can afford to eat at on a regular basis but it's fantastic for a special occasion.  If you're a fan of Indian food or looking for something new, I don't think The Dhaba will disappoint.

Nogales offers a standard Sonoran Hot Dog.  They're cooked up on a cart located at 20th St and Indian School (across the street from 7Eleven).  One plus over other Sonoran dog carts in they let you put your own toppings on.  This provides the customer the perfect opportunity to dress up their dogs to taste.  It's given to you with covered with pinto beans, diced tomatoes and mayo.  The rest is up to you.  I did get buns that were on the stale side the other night but I think it was just dumb luck.  Just read the other reviews and it's easy to see this is a quality cart.  An imperfect dog will slip thru from time to time.  Even with the inferior buns this was still one tasty dog.    Wash your Nogales dog down with a Mexican Coke.  It's a perfect pairing.

Lookout Mountain Preserve is a fantastic location.  Had I not moved just down the road I never would have known it was here.  It's not one of the hiking hot sports you'll read about in magazines or online.  From the bottom it might not look like much but you'll work your legs and maybe even your arms during your adventure.  I've made the trip up 3 times and each time I made it a different way.  There appears to be two main trails and then other unmarked paths that you can take at your own risk.  The journey may remind you of those Choose Your Own Adventure books from the 80s.  The view from the top is amazing.  Use caution and bring plenty of water if you intend to venture away from the designated trails.  My second trek ended up longer than expected.  Thankfully I brought along extra water.    Stay safe and watch your footing.  Almost took a spill or two.

This is a fantastic restaurant located in the strip mall on the Northeast corner of 43rd Ave & Peoria.  The sign out front still reads "Bisteces" but there is also a sign featuring Cuba.  If you see either, you're in the right place.  I popped in around 11am and had my pick of any table in the house.  Be warned it is very small.  Drop in around dinner time and you may have to wait.  If so, it will be worth it.  The menu had a lot of options from sandwiches to meals.  After reading over the entire menu I opted for the Cuban sandwich.  I've heard many great things about the Cuban sandwich but had never had the luxury of eating one.  Elected for a side of seasoned rice & black beans as well.  The sandwich has huge.  The grilled bread was stuffed with ham, shredded pork, mustard and pickle.  While stuffed on sandwich and rice I managed to save a little room for a guava tart.  They had a few desert options in the case and this one looked the most enticing to me.  It was a worthy selection and completed the meal perfectly.   Cuban Foods also offers a variety of Cuban soft drinks as well as American restaurant standards.  I walked away with a can of sugared water called Ironbeer.  It had a unique flavor that I cannot describe but the can boasts it includes "island spice".  It was not something I would drink on a regular basis but worth checking out for something new.    Cuban Foods Bakery & Restaurant is a great dining option.  It's even worth the drive if a bit of a long haul.  Definitely give this place a shot.

Top notch restaurant for breakfast options.  Please not that I tend to be biased against places famous for breakfast.  I can't give you a good reason why, though.  It's just how I am.  The food at Scramble, however, is worth mentioning.  I read about Scramble in Phoenix Magazine.  Turns out I have driven past it many times and never knew it existed.  Very happy to have picked up that issue (I don't read it on a regular basis).    Their Santa Fe style Eggs Benedic was great.  It's served with ham on jalapeno  corn bread and covered with a chipotle hollandaise sauce.  Rosemary potatoes are served on the side.  It wasn't as spicy as I hoped it would be but it was delicious.    The Costa burrito is also worth a mention as is the salsa it was served with.  One minor beef I have with Scramble is overpriced beverages.  It's a sacrifice I am willing to make.  When the food is quality I won't hold above average drink prices against Scramble.  Give Scramble a shot.  You'll be back.

After getting my haircut across the street I walked over to Dutch Bros. Coffee.  I've driven past so many times but never stopped.  I was aiming for a beverage and something to snack on.  Too my chagrin they offered nothing in the food stuffs category.  For some reason I assumed they would have donuts or something.  Oh well, my bad.  Since it was warming up I opted for a blended "Kicker" (at least that's what I think it was) a coffee drink blended with Irish Cream.  It was very tasty.  Better than anything I've had at Starbucks.  The service was uber friendly and fast.  Honestly, it's how I'd want service to be if I ran a business.  To top it all off, for reasons unknown to me, I was also given a free pair of D-Backs tickets.  Even if it was just a promotion to lure customers it came as a surprise and made my morning.  I will be back to Dutch Bros. and look forward to many Yelp check ins here.

Be warned.  A trip to Lo-Lo's will shave precious minutes off of your life.  Ah, heck.  I'm not a health nut and if you're taking a gander at Lo-Lo's reviews, odds are, neither are you.  Take a ride on the unhealthy side and enjoy your meal.    This morning marked my first visit to Lo-Lo's.  I wanted to hit up the original location south of downtown Phoenix but time dictated I opt for the closer location in Scottsdale.  The restaurant was of decent size and comfy.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Placed my order and it arrived quickly (easily within 15 minutes).    I ordered Sheedah's Special which consisted of a fried chicken breast & wing and a waffle and a side of grits.  For a beverage I ordered a Dr. Pepper and it arrived in a Kerr's canning jar.  Nice touch.  The waffle was unique and tasted of cinnamon.  The chicken was outstanding.  Seriously, it ranks as some of the best I've had.  Lo-Lo's should sell the chicken by the bucket.  My only gripe with Lo-Lo's is the ghetto glorification you'll see on the menu and the t-shirts.  A small annoyance that does not get in the way of the delicious food.

My experience with Vietnamese cuisine is limited to Pho Thanh and another place I dined at in Peoria.  Pho Thanh is my favorite of the two places.  I've been to Pho Thanh twice now.  Both times I ordered pho tai nam.  The dish is noodles in beef stock broth with slices of beef and brisket.  The bowl is dirt cheap (maybe $5 or $6).  Not only is the dish tasty but its easily one of the best values to be found at any restaurant in Phoenix and the surrounding area.  On my next visit I will expand my Vietnamese horizons and try something new.  The menu has well over 100 items to choose from.  Pho Thanh may not be in the best area and the strip center parking lot is small (and, sadly, filled with the vehicles of folks that have no clue how to park a car) but this place is a must visit.  If you're a fan of Asian cuisine in general or just looking to try something new. Pho Thanh is well worth your time.

I was pleased to find out about Fry Bread House East.  Not long ago I ventured to the original Fry Bread House in Phoenix and loved the food.  When I returned to Yelp to write it up I saw they had the East location in Mesa.  Happy to have great fry bread at a location that is more convenient for me.  They offer the same menu as the original restaurant.  Again I had the red chili beef Indian taco and, again, it was delicious.  At first glance the menu may appear pricey but the portions will leave you satisfied and stuffed.  Fry bread makes for a great taco base.  My only complaint is no free refills on the beverage and the cup is filled liberally with ice but, eh, I won't hold that against them.  The smaller mom and pop places need to find ways to make money and I'm sure this is a great saver for them.  On my next visit I have every intention of trying the desert style fry bread with the powdered sugar or chocolate sauce.  If you're in the east valley and looking to try something different, this is a place you need to check out.

I ventured into New China Super Buffet with a Chinese friend who was in need of comfort food from her motherland.  This joint was walking distance from her motel so we decided to give it a go.  An autographed poster of LaToya Jackson was the first thing I saw when I made my way to the buffet tables.  This, sadly, was the best part of the meal.  Well, the egg drop soup and chocolate pudding were good too.  Aside from that the food was abysmal.  Even the standard sweet and sour chicken was lackluster.  My friend stuck with white rice, broccoli and some noodles because the rest of what she picked over was not to her liking.  The staff, however, was able to serve her a glass of hot water that was to her liking.  In a desperate attempt to find an item to my liking I went for the American standard...pizza.  Even that was bad.    The staff was friendly and accommodating and it's a shame the quality of food could not match up to the people working there.  I really hate to say it but New China Super Buffet is the worst Chinese buffet I have ever eaten in.  Because I enjoyed the soup and staff I will grant two stars upon this, er, fine establishment.

The February 2011 issue of Phoenix Magazine featured an article about local artist Joerael Elliott and it featured a Native American themed mural he painted on the front of this local watering hole.  I wanted to see this for myself so I ventured out with a friend to 15th Ave & Camelback to take a look, snap a few pictures and wet my whistle.  Caravan is the epitome dive bar.  Golden Tee '07 and a Soprano's pinball machine are the most modern aspects of this place.  It seems like that type of place that serves the same devoted few over and over.  The crowd was Native American and I assume most of the regulars are (that may be why the mural is here).  Two pints of the finest Pabst Blue Ribbon can be had for a mere $5 and served by the pretty gal behind the bar.  This is my kind of place.  Caravan is the kind of place that will turn many off because it's not flashy or because the beer selection isn't impressive but that is what I love.  This place is a must for fans of dive bars.  I wish it was closer.  Luckily there's easy light rail access.

Dropped by Calico Jack's after tonight's Red Wings victory in Game 3 to kill time and let traffic thin.  Scanned the area and decided to give these folks our business.  We got inside where a total of maybe 5 or 6 other people were eating and drinking.  We took a seat and waited far too long for service for such an empty place.  Once we were served the folks were friendly enough and I was high on Red Wings victory so I let it slide.  Then we ordered...  Ordered the quesadillas and two beers (Tecate).  First our beer arrived...in cans.  I've never been served beer in a can unless it was PBR and even then we were told up front it was in a can.  Okay, I can live with that.  Then the quesadillas arrived.  They were no better than Taco Bell and probably triple the cost.  I expect to get gouged a bit at a restaurant just outside an arena but this was ridiculous.  Tonight was the first and last time I will visit Calico Jack's.  For the prices charged the food has to be superior to edible for me to even think of returning.

The food at Big Burrito isn't that bad but they have a lot of work to do.  I cannot think of a reason to visit this establishment over the other Mexican fast food joints.  I ordered the enchilada and burrito combo with carnitas.  The pork was diced as opposed to shredded and it was not very tasty.  To their credit, though, the portions were fair and I did not leave hungry.  The folks do a good job of keeping the place clean which is not the norm at other places I've been to.  If you're already in the area and in need of nourishment, Big Burrito is not a bad option.  Just don't expect anything special.  It's edible.

Believe the hype.  Short Leash Dogs owns!  The first sign that things were about to get very good was when a saw a fork on my dog.  Right off the bat I knew it was going to be messy and that's what I like.  I scanned the menu and opted for the Moki dog.  It began with my choice of dog (regular wiener) and then topped with green chilies, pinto beans, mayo, tomatoes, and onions.  It may be the best dog I have ever had.  It was that good.  All the flavors exploded in my mouth.  Short Leash Dogs has managed to turn a simple American culinary staple into something that is utterly amazing.  My only beef with Short Leash Dogs is they tend to operate on a schedule I cannot sync with because of work.  Today I lucked out when they opened shop for the day at a Whole Foods by my place of work.  Can I really hold that against them?  No, I cannot.  Time to find a new job!

I found Maui Dog on a whim.  A fantastic discovery for my taste buds.  I only wish I had found Maui Dog on Yelp sooner instead of catching it on a random drive down E Indian School.  A great city can never have too many hot dog options.  It's even better when a place has unique offerings.  This brings us to Maui Dog.  They have a variety of Hawaiian style options (dogs, burgers, wings) and sell tasty fresh cut fries and tots.    I had the all beef dog with volcanic chipotle mayo, Maui mustard, and a mix of coconut, mango and pineapple toppings.  All of which I never thought I'd eat on a hot dog.  It was a unique taste and utterly amazing.  The sweet bread bun is a great touch to this culinary treat.    Maui Dog has a new customer.  I will be returning in the not too distant future.  The only question is do I stick to the above or sample other items on the menu?  I'm curious to try something with SPAM!

I am now asking myself why it took so long to make the first trip to Beaver Choice.  Live and learn, my friends, live and learn.  To break my Swedish cuisine cherry I ordered the standard Kotbullar (Swedish meatball) plate.  It came with 3 side salads, a side and a small dish of very tart lingon berry preserve.  For the salads I chose tomato-basil salad, home made coleslaw and green peas.  For the side I chose two scoops of dill mashed potatoes.  All made perfect company for the 6 meatballs that served as the focal point of the dish.  The food was very good for $11.21 I had a hearty lunch that will surely hold me over for quite some time.  My belly is full and I feel like a nap (if only I was not departing for work shortly!).  Service was top notch.  The kid working the register was very friendly and answered my questions pertaining to the menu.  He was friendly and chatty with all customers.  I was told my lunch would take 15 minutes but it was more like 10.  There looks to be a few complaints here regarding service time but there's always a wait for good food.  If you want pre-cooked meals sitting under a UV light then go to McDonald's.  A nice touch is the IKEA decor.  Tables, chairs, table service and little Swedish flags.  Fitting.  I will be back at Beaver Choice in the not too distant future.  The only debate will be getting the meatballs again or trying something new.

I love me a giant slice of pizza.  One of those slices that is fit for folding like I was in New York City.  Oddly enough Sal's is based out of Boston!  The slices are 1/4 of a 19" pie.  They offer the standards as well as a few specialties and "Salzones".   Sal's delivers the goods.  I was very impressed with my pepperoni slice.  The pizza is good and they are open late which is a Godsend for me.

I am not a coffee drinker so I cannot attest to what JoBot allegedly best but the crepes were delicious.  The menu offered crepes of a hearty variety (with meats and cheeses) and those of a desert variety (fruits, chocolate and whipped cream).  Waiting next door for a band to begin I worked up a hunger so I opted for the machaca pulled pork crepe with mozzarella and a fantastic salsa that was actually hot.  As a Michigan native I was pleased to see JoBot stocks Faygo Root Beer and was happy that I could enjoy the sweet nectar of my childhood to wash down my tasty meal.  Phoenix's Roosevelt Row has much to offer.  JoBot Coffee adds to the mix very well.    I will be back.

A guy from work recommended this place Tavern Grille (formally Teakwood).  He said the wings were amazing.  I need of a place to catch the final 10 minutes of a hockey game last night after work I opted to check these guys out as it's just a short drive from where I work.  The place was dead.  In fact I've never been in such an empty place that was not a dive.  Being Scottsdale, though, I guess they close shop early along with the other restaurants in the area.  The set up was very nice.  It has a neighborhood tavern feel.  The bar is long and stocked with comfortable stools.  Lots of booths to choose from and the typical bar fare of darts and pool table.  Tavern Grille has plenty of televisions as well so this would be a good place to visit when multiple games are going on.  The wings were served up fast and they were quite delicious.  Not the best wings I've had, nor the hottest, but they were still very good.  Easily the best ones I've had in the Valley since I moved here.  Give it's location and hours of operation, Tavern Grille is not a place I will visit on a regular basis but I will be back in the future.  Maybe one a day off for lunch or dinner.

Thank you, Java Magazine!  Had I not picked up the latest copy at Circle K, Tacos Atoyac would have remained an unknown in my life.  The food here is amazing.  For lunch I tried every taco on the menu (carne asada, al pastor, lengua, chorizo and tripa o cabeza) and one off menu (carne asada/chorizo mix) plus the Oaxacan hotdog (diced bacon, black beans) and a bottle of Mexican Coke.  Not only was it all delicious but it was dirt cheap.  All was had for just over $10.    Be sure to try the house sauces.  The have a green and red and a fantastic guacamole sauce.  One of the owners mans the cash register and the other cooks your food.  Service is friendly and quick.  Best tacos around.  Easily.

Whilst walking the Roosevelt Row area I came across a sign for FilmBar.  This is a place I had never read about or heard about.  The sign boasted 30+ beer variety and independent film.  I had to check it out.  Glad I did.  This is one of the most unique places that I have been in.  There's a bar up front near the entrance and there's tables as the room wraps around the corner.  Most of the seating is in an area that is incredibly dark.  Too dark for me so I ventured back to the bar area where there was more light.  Very unusual but interesting none the less.  The decor was different too: puffy stools and benches at low seated tables.  It had an oriental feel almost.  The beer selection was impressive and they even have a cinema to screen flicks.    FilmBar is a very cool place.  It's a unique business and I'm so glad it's here and look forward to visiting again in the not too distant future.

It started two weeks ago when I purchased my ticket from their window.  I was charged $2.50 for a service fee.  What service was provided?  All I received was a ticket and it wasn't a real ticket.  It was simply a standard receipt.  When I go grocery shopping or go to any store I get the same thing without being charged a "service fee".  At the club I was treated to a two drink minimum.  I ended up with two bottles of Blue Moon for $12.  That's not a typo.  You read that correctly.  $12 for two bottles of Blue Moon.  A guy sitting across the table from me said he didn't drink alcohol and was offered a bottomless Coke for $13.  The server was obnoxious, took too long to bring out my drinks and irritated myself and the folks sitting around me.  During the act the server came around trying to sell shots on special.  Why were we interrupted during the show?  A 15% gratuity was added automatically to my bill.  This does not sit well with me as I do not believe in standard mandatory tipping.  A tip is for good service and should not be included automatically on the bill.  Besides, with good service I would have left a larger tip than what was added.   I could have lived with this and let it go but the waiter also asked each party if they would round up to 20% and leave a few extra bucks.  This was over the line and out of bounds as far as I am concerned.  The show itself was great and my review is not a reflection on the talent that performs at Stand Up Live.  I do not enjoy, however, getting overcharged on beer and paying fees for imaginary services.

For many months I watched and waited as Tempe Tavern came to be.  I wanted a good local watering hole that wasn't a sports bar or one of those Mill Ave joints that turns into a dance club at 10pm.  Tempe Tavern is neither.  It's a classic local watering hole.  The beer selection is impressive for a place it's size and they offer a good menu.  They serve some of the best hot wings I've had since moving to metro Phoenix.  Service is friendly and the beer is cheap.  On top of it all this is the only place I know of around here that serves Schlitz.  When you sit at the bar make sure to try the hot 'n' spicy peanuts in the carafe's.    The place has never been too crowded either but I've heard they do have some busy shifts.  I assume these are Friday and Saturday nights.  I typically hit up Tempe Tavern on Sunday or Monday.  My only complaint is petty: there's not jukebox.  Maybe that will come along with time.   They do pump in music from somewhere.  Mostly alternative stuff.  There's a little stage for bands to perform and I have hopes of checking out some of the local music soon.  Tempe Tavern is a fantastic place.  If you're looking for a neighborhood bar and want to get away from the college kid hell that is Mill Ave then this is the place for you.  The crowd is still mostly college age but it's not the same cast of Jersey Shore casting call rejects that haunt Mill Ave.

Good dogs at a good price.  Ed offers a nice variety too.  I often walk around downtown but never made to the courthouse until this afternoon when I had to report for jury duty.  Oddly enough, I had read about Ed somewhere before but this was the first I had been by his cart.  Today he was set up on the SW corner of Jefferson & 1st Ave.  I'm not sure if this is a regular spot or if he moves about the area but I'll be on the lookout for him again so I can try a variety of his hot dogs.  Ed stocks Faygo Root Beer in cans.  That alone is worth a mention.

Winco Foods is all the rage now.  Will this continue or will Winco lose it's luster once it's just another grocery store and the new kid in town?  There's nothing special about Winco.  It's your typical grocery.  I'm not a savvy coupon clipper or price matcher so I cannot attest to the savings to be had at Winco.  A thrifty shopper I know claims the savings are to be had.  That said there are two negatives that shine brightly at Winco: credit cards not accepted and cheap bags.  Do not come here if your earnings are running low.  I just gathered my weekly groceries and expected to charge 'em.  Not a surprise I was looking forward to after waiting in the long lines.  On my first visit most of the bags were torn up the seam and the handles were split.  For one reason or another the cashier actually helped bag my haul.  How she could hand over bags so blatantly ripped is beyond me.  On the plus side, Winco stocks Shasta Tiki Punch.  Winco isn't a terrible place but I don't see any reason to jettison Fry's and Target (unless I'm in the mood for Tiki Punch).  Take it or leave it.

It's the first week of the NFL season and I came to scout the place as a potential home for NFL games.  I came early and my game was placed on one of the large television sets close to my table.  The chips and salsa were plopped onto the table not long after I sat down.  Great chips and a salsa with a kick.  Nothing overly spicy but enough to get me a little snotty.  That's just how I like my salsa.  I started of with a Dr. Pepper that was refilled over and over without hesitation.  Filling my drink is essentially the only thing I look for in a server.  It's make or break when it comes to tip time.    I ordered the Pernil Asado tacos (roast pork & mango salsa) as it sounded interesting.  Not only was it tasty but the portions were generous.  The ample serving of pork made this dish of great value.  The imported beer was pricey at $4 per pint but my drink limit is two when I'm out so it wasn't terrible.  Fuego isn't a place I'd come just to drink at that price.  Service was very attentive and very friendly.  Based on other reviews here I suspect there's been some change in staff or overly picky Yelpers.  Fuego Cantina is a great place if you ask me.  I was more than impressed with the service and food and the layout of the screens is perfect for football games.  I aim to make this my Sunday home.

One of the newest places in town and it's already one of the best.  The beer selection is most impressive and the largest I have seen in Phoenix.  Some local, some independent brew and lots from Germany and Belgium.  I'm told the selection will always change a bit.  When one keg runs empty it will be replaced in back with a different selection on hand.  Expect to see some variance each visit.  The food menu boasted some interesting selections and they've made an effort to put unique selections or spins on traditional bar fare.  I tried the Spam sliders.  They were okay but that's all on me.  I learned I did not care for Spam too much.  Went for something new and wasn't too pleased but I live and learn.  I know there are items on the menu I would surely enjoy.  Service was great: quick and friendly.  To top it off, Angels Trumpet Ale House sells growlers!  Awesome.  Come in and enjoy and leave with a growler of your favorite beer.  Keep in mind the growler selection may not be open to everything on the menu.  Located across the street from FilmBar, this is in a great location and can easily be incorporated into a fun night out.    Angels Trumpet Ale House will become one of my regular haunts along with FilmBar and Revolver Records.

Anyone that has spent any amount of time in Chicago or its surrounding suburbs knows about Portillo's.  These folks will not look to Yelp for a recommendation.  The Portillo's beef is legendary.    For those not accustomed to Portillo's this is the place to go for a true Italian beef.  I've had a few out here.  With the exception of Dazzo's Dog House I have not been impressed.  Portillo's delivers the goods.  You can also get Chicago dogs, Italian sausage, burgers, chicken sandwiches, catering, shakes, malts and killer fries.    The restaurant is large and will accommodate a lot of people even with the hoards flocking to a new restaurant.   For my money you cannot beat the beef sandwich dipped with mozzarella.  It's my standard order.

I've heard a lot of great things about America's Taco Shop so I dropped in while my vehicle was being serviced nearby.  Reading over other reviews it appears this location does not live up to the standards that people expect from America's Taco Shop.  I cannot attest as I've never been to other locations.  Oddly enough my complaint is not the good but the price.  I ordered the 3 taco combo and a drink.  With a drink it came in at just under $12.  When my order arrived I was shocked, for the price, to see that it was literally just 3 tacos.  No sides.    I did enjoy the tacos but it was of no real value.  I can go to a hole-in-the-wall further south down 16th St and get great food, and more of it, for half the price.

There is a sign by the cash register.  It reads, essentially, as follows: "If you order a SODA, we'll give you a POP."  At this point I knew I was in good company.  Ordered two Detroit Coney Dogs, fresh cut fries and a Faygo Root Beer.  Pure Michigan right there.  The dogs were first class.  Meat was quality and the chili top notch.  The hefty batch of fresh cut fries made for the perfect side and, needless to say, Faygo delivered with their quality root beer.    If you're a Michigan transplant, this is the place for you.  Even if you have to travel a bit.  A taste from home is well worth it.

After my first visit to Detroit Coney Grill, I was hesitant to leave a 5-star review. I wanted to be more objective and wondered if I wasn't wearing homer goggles. After multiple visits it's clear that Detroit Coney Grill is legit. Everything I've ordered has been top notch. The coney dogs, the loose burgers and the classic burgers and, of course, the fresh cut fries (go Cajun style!). They do it all and they do it greatly. You will not find a better coney dog in the valley. It does not matter where you are from, the food is fantastic. Detroit Coney Grill has become one of my favorite dining spots in the valley. This is also the only place I know of where I can order food and wipe my feet on an Ohio State rug (the homer in me loves this).

We've been lucky to see quality pizza joints opening in and around downtown Phoenix. All of them, however, seem to be the thin crust wood or brick oven fired variety. I have nothing against that style of pie and enjoy the pizza joints that have been opening but if I'm going out for pizza, what I really want is a floppy NYC style slice. Enter Grand Avenue Pizza Company.  Dropped in around 1 AM on a Saturday. I was just sitting around on my duff and watching Japanese wrestling videos on YouTube when the desire for a slice hit. I had recently discovered that Grand Ave. Pizza was open until 4 am so I walked over and order some slices.  It's everything I expected it to be. A quality slice. Slices of pepperoni go for $3.50 each. Not too bad when I've paid the same for larger, but inferior, slices in NYC. My only regret is not visiting sooner. Grand Avenue Pizza Company was left on my "to do" list for far too long.  Prices for an entire pie are a bit high. An 18" pepperoni will set you back $21. I'm willing to pay more for local, though, and quality to boot.  The joint itself is small but has pizzeria charm and I think there's a dining area in back or along the side of the building but it was dark and I didn't explore so don't hold me to it.  Good pizza. I will return.
