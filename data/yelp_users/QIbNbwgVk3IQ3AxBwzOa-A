Fast and friendly service. Line goes fast, drinks are served fast and if there is any mistake it is immediately corrected.

No customer service. It took cashier 15 minutes or even more to run some transaction. Then the manager came and helped her to run it and rang me up. No hi, no how are you... nothing. I was in a hurry and waited for 15 minutes. Didn't wait so much time in Walgreen's before.

Absolutely like this hotel, it always has beautiful decorations inside and the stores I like including Guess. Some of the stores I visited had very nice customer service.

This is the place where you can drink variety of teas and I must say they are sooo tasty! Coffee is good too, but that green tea with strawberries is yumm. Baristas are always wry attentive and friendly.

I celebrated two Valentine's Days there. It was an extremely busy place those days. Service was very good, servers were friendly, patient and attentive, but it took some time to get our drinks (about 10 minutes or even more). I still put 5 stars because I would recommend this place for any occasion or just lunch/dinner. The food there is delicious.

I always face problems at this VS store. Returns and any kinds of transaction not related to purchase transactions are extremely hard to fulfill for cashiers. If it wasn't close, I wouldn't go there at all. Some things other VS stores say they can do, at this store are impossible!

The store impressed me by how clean and neat it was and sales persons greeted and said "bye" when I walked in and out. Very pleasant and friendly atmosphere inside.

One of the best places when me and my friends celebrate birthdays and have fun. Also, you can bring your own food for your party :)

Rude, unprofessional. Unwilling to help. Would not recommend to any one. Stay as far as you can.

Very delicious place for healthy eaters. My favorite plates are kale Caesar salad and shrimp protein bowl with quinoa. Definitely like this place. They also do tasty fresh pressed juices.

The best company for repairing phones I have ever had a deal with. They came out to me at the time that fit my schedule and fixed my iPhone 5s screen in about 15-20 minutes! I didn't think it could be so fast! The screen was placed very accurately and the phone worked as well as it did before. I highly recommend this company for repairing phones because I have received an excellent mobile service and iPhone repair at the place and time that fit my schedule. Very punctual and knowledgeable guys!

I needed some important documents to be translated and notarized. I called World Language Professionals, so that they could help me with that. I must say it is the best and fastest service I've ever experienced. The translation was very accurate and it's very convenient that translation and notary services are all in one place! I saved a lot of time by using WLP services. Next time I need help with my documents, I will definitely call this place!

I cracked my iPhone 6 screen one again, went to these guys since they are at Tempe now, got same excellent service as I did last time, walked out with my phone repaired 20 minutes later. I highly recommend them!
