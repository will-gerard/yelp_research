What a great Happy Hour at La Stalla!  My wife and I go quite a bit for an early dinner and can walk out for less than $20.   Happy Hour is every evening from 4 - 6 an we usually get a beer or two a piece (at only $2) and great authentic Italian pizza (at only $5 a pie).    When we've ate a full dinner - it's always been great as well. The desserts are fantastic ... Check out La Stalla!

Highly recommended and we will absolutely use again!  My wife and I wanted to add some LIGHT to our great room and some SOUND to our patio. After a little research with yelp, I decided on Dodge Electric. Why? Because Mike, the project manager, responded to my email within 24 hours. Others didn't respond at all or were a week later (after I had already secured Dodge). Of course, the initial request for a quote went out as a result of high reviews on yelp.  All via email (my preference), Mike and I decided on a date for Dodge Electric to come out and take a look at our home and give us a quote.  Preston arrived on time and asked great questions and made fantastic suggestions in regards to what we wanted. While we had a "wishlist" of what we might get done (dependent on the price of each mini-project), we decided to price out adding can lights to our great room, speakers to our patio, a speaker outlet for our backyard, can lights for the master bedroom, a light over the master shower (per Preston's recommendation, one that can handle the moisture and doesn't give off creepy, unnatural light) as well as two 'Christmas Outlets' on both sides of our house. In the end, we just chose to light up our Great Room and bring sound to our patio and add an outlet for future speakers in the yard.  The estimate came in at nearly what we expected. We had a quote from a contractor which we thought was a bit outrageous - Dodge Electric's quote was within what we originally might have expected. Everything, again, was handled via email. The quote was sent in PDF form, we signed it on our iPad and sent back the work request to Mike, who then emailed back to confirm a date for install.  On the installation day, the two electricians, Francisco and Roger, arrived within the time window Mike had provided. We confirmed the work we were having done. One snafu: they were going to install dimmer switches that didn't match what we already had. During the initial appointment, Preston had taken pictures of what we already had so they matched. No problem for Roger, he said he'd just run and grab the ones that matched! No push back or anything from Roger, just a "no problem," essentially.  Roger and Francisco went right to work after finalizing locations of our can lights and speakers as well as the new switches. All-in-all, it took about five hours to complete the work, which was less than expected. They cleaned up after themselves for the most part, were nice to talk to and always wanted to make sure things looked good and we approved.  Such a relief to hire a service that cares about customer satisfaction. They've created a raving fan. We will highly recommend them to friends, family and coworkers without hesitation.

Fantastic! I left this morning to a cool home that's only 2.5 years old. When my son and I got home tonight, it was 84 degrees inside - clearly something had gone wrong.  I called Chas Roberts first, because they were listed on both of my thermostats and I knew they installed everything when the home was being built. The earliest they would arrive would be 7 AM tomorrow/the next morning. Sure, I could've slept in the part of the house that still had air conditioning, but, the main area of the house was just going to heat up more in the August-Excessive-Heat-Warning temperatures!  I also called a few other places, but, I just got voicemail even though their websites claimed 24/7 service.  When I called April Air Conditioning, Mike answered and said he could be out within the hour as he was finishing up another job. Within the hour? Absolutely!   Mike arrived within the hour and went right to work, determining what the issues was (the capacitor had gone out) and fixing it. Within 2.5 hours of arriving home from work I had went from shocked to annoyed to concerned to relieved to a cool house.  I would highly recommend April Air Conditioning - and will whenever the subject comes up with family and friends!

I read about Classic Italian Pizza in a magazine saying it was one of the best pizza places in the Phoenix Metro Area.  Being HUGE Pizzeria Bianco fans, we heard a lot of talk that this place was just as good.  It's not.  A few days after reading about Classic Italian Pizza, we saw a Groupon and figured fate had intervened and was telling us to get our butts to this place!  We went on a Friday evening right when they opened at 5 PM.  We were surprised at it's tucked-away location in a strip mall that's way past it's peak time.  But, these are the types of places we love - family-owned, unique and *hopefully* amazing food and service.  That's why I love Yelp so much - it helps my family find these places and myself when I'm traveling for work.    Back to the visit.  We showed up a few minutes prior to 5 PM and were just walking around outside waiting for them to open.  Some of the employees were sitting outside on the patio and we got a less-than-comfortable stare down from them and at 4:59, one of said employees opened the door and said, "You know we open at 5, right?"  Umm, yes, I do know that's why we're not pressing our faces against the glass wondering why nobody is letting us in...  In other words: a less than desirable start to this experience.  We overlooked the menu (and had done so online already) and decided to go with the Aglio Oglio appetizer, a Margherita Pizza and a Vegetarian Pizza.  With our high expectations and all the comparisons to Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix, we were super excited to get started.    The Aglio Oglio was AMAZING.  Pumpkin seed oil infused with fresh garlic and jalape√±os - FANTASTIC!  Something we'll definitely try to mimic at home.  It came with freshly baked bread (from the wood fire oven, I assume) that was also killer.  A great start.  "Bring on the pizza", we thought!   And when it was brought, our high expectations were shattered.  In a bad way.  The Margherita Pizza was as expected in terms of initial appearance.  You can't really screw that up.  The Vegetarian Pizza, however, didn't look too appetizing.  Why?  Because it looked like ingredients from a frozen pizza.  The mushrooms didn't appear to be anything but baked, the over abundance of black olives was less than appealing, and the sliced tomato was just there - nothing extraordinary.    The taste is where it all fell apart.  With expectations set that it's true, authentic, Italian pizza in a wood-burning oven and an immediate analogy to Pizzeria Bianco, the taste was not remotely where we expected.  The wood burning oven taste was not there.  There wasn't the smoky flavor you'd expect.  It was just, pizza.  In fact, we could've drove twenty less miles and had a much better pizza in Chandler at La Stalla.  Or drove ten more miles and went to Bianco.  For our two pizzas, at least, the true potential of the 800+ degree wood burning oven was not met.  Bad?  No.  Good?  I guess.  Top notch and worthy of 'Top Ten Lists' for the USA?  Absolutely not.  No way.  No how.

As a beginning CrossFitter, I looked at a few CrossFit locations and ended up joining CrossFit Incite. I was a bit intimidated at before the first time going because it had been a few years since I had continually lifted and had only really been running on a semi-consistent basis. However, I knew I wanted something that would kick my ass, get me strong and keep me motivated.  I have all that with CrossFit Incite. The workouts are varied each day (as they are in any CrossFit box/gym). I don't have to think about what I am going to do each day, I just have to show up. The workouts are tough, too - usually quick compared to what most people spend at a traditional gym, but ass kicking hard. Better yet, as you get stronger and build endurance, they continue to get harder. The great thing about CrossFit is you're really working against yourself - continually getting stronger, faster, better.  I'd definitely recommend CrossFit Incite - whether you're a tenured CrossFitter or just thinking about getting started.
