Dr Sherman and Jessica are the best.  Jessica will bend over backwards to make sure you get an appointment, and find you cancelations if needed, she ROCKS!   Dr Sherman, is just amazing.  I can't say enough good things about him.  He is knowledgeable, efficient and attentive.  My injury was affecting my ability to do my job and live a quality life.  I was not sleeping due to pain, and suffering in my career due to range of motion and muscle weakness, in just a under a month he has gotten my full range of motion back, 90% pain free, and continues to read what my body is telling him.  I leave feeling 100% confident that I will heal.  If you have tried other physical therapy or chiropractic services, I strongly recommend you make the switch to Dr Sherman and let your body do the talking.

My husband and I rarely eat out due to eating very clean through out the week, so when we go out it is a splurge.  A girl from work told me about Cassanova Bros' pizza.  She said it was awesome, so I convinced my husband to go.  It was a drive from out house but WELL WORTH IT.  I got a white pizza with fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and tomatoes, spousal unit got neapolitan with sausage, pepperoni, and bacon.  SOOOO GOOD! usually i eat about 2-3 pieces but this pizza I couldn't stop eating it. Fresh, creamy, crunchy, chewy... delicious.  My man killed his entire pizza. Enough said.  We will absolutely be going back.  You should go, place is unassuming, and casual, they will make you feel like you have been going for years and are old friends.  go there.

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!! If I could give this place zero stars I would.  This is going to be a long crappy review, but the summary is do NOT take a vehicle to this place if you want it to be cleaned.    I came to this car wash on a referral from a friend to get my vehicle, a 2005 Chrysler 300c, detailed.  I met the sale person at the front lanes and he sold me on a $240 dollar detail and stated they would clean the vehicle from bumper to bumper.  I made sure to point out area's on the interior which I wanted cleaned including hang grime on the steering wheel, dirty carpet and the front leather seats which were dirty from a couple years of use.  The guy stated they could handle getting all of those area's cleaned, "No problem", and went on to tell me that its usually the red drink stains in the carpet that won't come out easily, which he did not see in my vehicle.  I again clarified that the seats, steering wheel and normal dirt in the carpets are what I really wanted cleaned.  I told him I didn't care that much about the outside, or about the engine bay at all.  I asked if they could just not clean the engine and he stated it was basically just a pressure washer off after degreasing it.  About 5 hours after I dropped my vehicle off the guy called and stated it was ready to be picked up.  I arrived about an hour after the phone call.  I looked at the outside of my car and noticed the clay bar polish looked good but the windows looked dirty as I walked up.  I then looked in the driver's door and was almost speechless.  The fronts seats had not been cleaned and it looked like they had just sprayed armor all on them.  The carpet was wet, but all of the dirt was still there.  I refused to sit in the car because I thought my clothes would get all shiny from the grease on the seats.  One of the detailers popped the hood as I stood there and I stood there trying not to freak out.  A female, who I later found out was the manager, whistled when the guy popped the hood and said, "Sure is shiny" as we both looked into the puddle's of grease all over my engine.    At this point I felt my car was actually dirtier now then when I brought it in to get detailed.  I looked inside of the driver's door again, and I guess the manager could see the disgust on my face and asked what was wrong.  I pointed to the obvious area near the door lock on the door panel which was still dusty and had not even been wiped and said theres a good start.  Then I pointed at the seats which were still dirty,  the dirt on the center console, the greasy overspray all over my radio, the dirt on the arm rest and the dirty carpets.    The manager said, "Oh, usually my guys do a better job than this."  I asked for my floor mats, and the manager told a guy to go get them because they forgot to put them back in the car.  The guy gets the floor mats and casually throws them on the back seats, which had just been "detailed".  I got the floor mats, popped the trunk to put them inside, and looked to find the trunk hadn't even been vacuumed out.  There was still dust and dirt all over it.  I called the manager over and she said they would take care of it right away. I told her I had bought a $240 detail, not a $20 driver thru wash and that I was very disappointed.  I said to her I would give the detail a 3 out of 10.  The manager replied that if I brought my car back in a day or two she would have one of her guys "FINISH" the detail.  I told her that was unacceptable and I shouldn't have to bring my car back.  She replied if I left it for a couple more hours today, they would finish the detail.  So after 3 more hours the manager calls to say my car is ready.  I show up and they had done a better job on the seats and carpet, but they still weren't at a professional detail level.  They had now literally covered the dash and door panels with armor all.  The was puddles of the crap in the window switches and it was running down the air vents.  The steering wheel was still dirty and they hadn't even cleaned the inside of the windows.  I told the manager to give me my keys and I left as soon as I possible could.  I left immediately because I was afraid I might actually start yelling and trying to fight the diminished mental capacity detailer and manager who had now officially made my car dirtier than when I brought it in.  I had the pleasure of stopping at an auto supply store and buying leather cleaner and conditioner and interior cleaner, so that when I got home I could clean off the grease all over the interior.  I called the corporate manager who never apologized for the horrible service.  Instead he just stated he would come get my vehicle from my house and take it to get detailed at another Classic Car Spa.  I told him there was no chance in hell of him or any Classic Car Spa employee's ever touching my vehicle again.  After he refused to give me a refund, I hung up and called my credit card to dispute the charges.  AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!
