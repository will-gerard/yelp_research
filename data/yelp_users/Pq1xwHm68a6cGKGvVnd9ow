What a complete ass of a person. He is the rudest person you will meet this week, probably this month, and that's so long as you don't meet anyone for the rest of the year. He will walk out of the room while you are in mid sentence, fail to answer your questions, and ignore you. Having said all that he is, unfortunately, very good at what he does. If you need a good doctor, and you always need a dr who is good, then Dr Solbel always fits the bill. He recognizes symptom and correctly diagnoses every time and on even very little information. His arrobance is annoying, but rather like Dr. House on TV. I stopped going to him about 10 years ago because I ccouldn't stand him any longer, and I cannot possibly recommend using him since there are plenty of other good docs, but if you have to use Larry Sobel, you can do so trusting you will receive good advice, if he actually takes thetime to give you some advice. Also, plan on spending an entire day. You'd think gthat since3 he spends so little time with each patient and is so abrupt, you would expect that he can run an on-time schedule, but such is just not the case. I have, in the past, spent 4 hours in his waiting room after arriving on time for an appointment. If you can possibly go elsewehre, I suggest you do so. If you find yourself stuck with this doc, you will receive good medical treatment. I am convinced that is the ONLTY reason he is still in business.

I found Hiro Sushi to be excellent. The quality of the fish used was high, and the service was good. I enjoyed the sunomono (cucumber salad) and their mango ice-cream dessert was very good. The Hamachi (yellowtail) was very good, and the portions were generous. The rolls did fall apart a little and could have been packed tithgter but the overall quality was terrific and the price was good.

This has to be one of the worst restaurants in Scottsdale.  The food is just pitiful.  The service is OK as befitting a small neighborhood restaurant.  We had egg rolls that were so dripping in oil that it was leaking out as you picked them up.  Bright yellow oily drippings. Not cool.  The kung pow was so-so as was the garlic chicken.  The best part of the meal was the almond cookie!  Even the fortune cookie was sub par. I will not be returning!

This is one of the best food stores in town. The staff are friendly & helpful. The store is always spotless & very well stocked. Their checkouts are all fully automated and they have a ton of them so there's alkmost never any line, you just scan everything yourself and swipe your card to pay. While you are doing that there is usually someone who will come by and bag for you. They often have boxes for you to leave your receipt in so a local school can get credit for your purchases and then money is donated to that school,   F&E is a great store for small families down to as few as a couple or even a single person. They always have good specials & they usually have some organic items too. Look out for their samples, it always makes shopping here fun. If you like English foods, they have more than most since they are owned by Tesco which is one of the largest supermarket chains in the world. Tesco has massive supermarkets in the UK and here in the US they have set up F&E as a chain of smaller stores, but as a company they really know how to conduct business. Look for Heinz Baked Beans which come in cans and are good heated and served on buttered toast. Another English favorite which they have in cans is a sponge pudding called "Spotted Dick" - don't knock it till you've tried it!! In England it's usually served with custard (English style - they sell packets of Bird's custard which is made by mixing the powdered contents in the envelope/packet with milk while heating slowly. This dish (custard) easily develops a skin on top which most people find pretty gross, so heat it carefully and follow the instructions carefully. I personally prefer Golden Syrup on my spotted dick, which is a treacle like thick syrup but F&E don't carry Golden Syrup. However, if you find a store that sells English items they will sometimes have Tate & Lyle's Golden Syrup - it comes in a can with a lid that you pop off them re-seal for storing the unused portion, rather like a tea can. Drizzle one teaspoon of golden syrup over the warmed spotted dick for a rare treat!! You can sometimes find English products, including Golden Syrup, at World Market.

I am not recommending Kampai any longer. Stay away.  I used to eat here a fair bit. At that time the place next door wasn't a karate studio, but a tropical fish store - at least as appropriate, maybe moreso. Kampai Sushi used to be good, I just haven't been to Kampai for quite a while - several years, in fact. Yesterday it was very so-so, in fact below par. The prices are not good, since they are priced as single pieces, & this is the only time I have ever seen sushi served in single piece servings. At $2.50 per piece, it matches the $5 per order (2 pieces) you pay everywhere else. The rice was not tightly packed, and the Tamago (egg) was tasteless. The Hamachi (Yellowtail), usually my favorite also lacked taste, and the eel may not have been too fresh - not actually turned bad yet, but not as fresh as it could have been. Either way, SOMETHING I ate there made my stomach go topsy-turvy & made me feel quite ill. Needless to say, I now know why it's been so long since I have been to Kampai, and it will be a lot longer before I return. Oh, and the owner is still the same guy, and he's a miserable so-and-so, I have never seen a frown which would make such a big grin if it were turned upside-down! My wife was the one who spotted that the eel didn't seem to be as fresh as it should be, though she didn't get sick.

We have eaten here before & found it to be excellent but this time will be the last time we eat at Beckett's table. We were a party of four and to say that the service was lacklustre would be very generous. My wife's white sea bass was actually served so cold it might have come straight from the refrigerator with the exception it had obviously been cooked, so that would indicate it was left out to get stone cold while the other dishes were prepared. There were four of us and although my food was excellent the food served to our two guests was very ordinary. But for the extremely poor, bordering upon rude, service, the evening would have been at least OK after the sea bass was exchanged for a warmer one, which took far too long since the other three of us had almost finished eating when the replacement arrived and was thrown in front of my wife. I have never had such poor service in any decent restaurant and unfortunately I don't feel I can recommend Beckett's table to anyone. No one visited our table to apologize for the cold food and I suspect the server did not even mention it to anyone in management because I cannot see any reasonable manager failing to at least visit our table to apologize.

We were seated immediately although the place was packed. The service was a little on the slow side but very friendly and they were, after all, very busy. The eggplant parm was excellent and the bruschetta was delicious. The calamari was lovely too. Overall  I would certainly recommend Stone & Vine.
