Worst buffet I've ever been to!   Decided to dine here after seeing how well presented the food seemed to be displayed.   The price is a little more than most buffets around the area at $15.99 per person for dinner and an additional $1.99 for a drink since it is not included. I did not mind the price one bit since like I said the food seemed to be well displayed making it look appetizing.   We started out at the Mongolian grill. Donner had started 20 minutes prior and already they were out of bell peppers, zucchini, and broccoli. Our Mongolian was bland even though we added a bowl full of sauce due to the cook pouring too much water once on the grill.  We moved onto the food. As I mentioned dinner had started 20 minutes prior to our arrival and the food options tasted as bought they had been sitting out for a while.   The rice was bland and noodles were starting to dry out.  Although I was hoping to have a great experience here, it was not the case and I was bummed.   There are so many options for Chinese buffets here in The valley this place does not make the cut to even attempt to try a second time.

So sad to have had a negative experience here after so many good ones.  Today was less busy than any other day we have visited the restaurant.  The waitress came to our table to ask for our order and bring check. I between we had to ask passing servers for service.  When we the bill came we tried to use our Groupon and were told that we could not use it. When we have the waitress our debit card to pay the waitress overcharged our card. (Ludmila) was the name stated on the receipt.   We are now currently waiting for her to return to our table to fix this issue.   Two stars were due to the food and other servers being awesome.  General manager "Carlos" came to our table and treated us as it was our fault for groupon a being used in previous visits. He didn't even apologize for the waitress overcharging is just dismissed what I was saying and said it was an easy fix"check your bills when Ludmila is your waitress.  Update: after having to show him we have been there many times with positive experiences, the general manager attempted to show us some fine print which even he could not find. He ended up letting us use the groupon with a heavy emphasis that it would not be allowed in future visits. Next time Carlos, how about a sorry about the inconsistency, and sorry for our server overcharging you. Don't blame customers for a waitress not checking up on a table and having your patrons flag down servers for service.   Last time coming here!

Favorite place to get a milk Thai boba tea Lunch deals are pretty decent my friend ordered the orange chicken and I ordered the sesame. Both came with an eggroll and your choice of white or pork fried rice. Egg drop soup is my fav.

Best boba tea ever! Love the taro slushie with boba and the chicken tenders with mild sauce! Sauce is sweet but still has a kick! Always a great treat to come here. Service is always fast and friendly.

Wish I could rate a one star  Horrible service was suckered into getting the inside and outside detailed due to the "ladies day" special by Abel.  Car was ran into the carwash but still had the lines of dirt on the top of car. The inside was not vacuumed and the seats still had crumbs on them.   When I lifted my car's mats there was still grass and debri proving furthermore that they had not vacuumed my carpet.   They did clean my mats but the guy giving me my car keys stepped on my mat and left his foot prints on the white design from his dirty shoes.

This place sucks! Had to tell them to vacuum my car again when I said why my inside looked so opaque customer survive guy said "obviously the services are rushed we're busy." Paid for the VIP. Waste of money. My car doesn't smell so I didn't get my air freshner and my inside was def not dressed. And to top it off they parked my car underneath a tree with pollen falling. Fail!!!!

Always a great experience when dining here! The entire staff from manager to hostess rock at customer service. Very attentive and helpful. Ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad (ask for the chicken to be warmed up) and a large pizza with pep and spicy chicken sausage. If you have not dined here, you are missing out :)   Also recently found out about their birthday rewards! Such a treat.

Wish I could give a 0 star review!!!! Old man with glasses not only cut me twice and left acrylic on my skin but you could see the previous color which was not removed properly. When I told him you could still see the black underneath the pink he said the gel color would cover it. Long story short you could still see he black through the pink gel color this is where he said it was my fault and that I had no common sense!!! I said "excuse me?!" He replied, " it's your fault you didn't turn your finger when I took off" I replied, "so it's my fault? Is it my fault you cut me too?!" He replied, "something like that." He then proceeded to insult me and I told him I no longer wanted him to do my nails and he tried to say I was talking to myself not you.. Umm no you weren't you were replying to me.   Paid $70 for a shitty ass service!

I placed an online order, when I arrived they had not even read the order; let alone started to make it. They offered a discount but as we waited, we saw other customers get mad about their lengthy wait times and wrong orders. An employee gave a customer the wrong order and when they realized it, they ran outside to the car to get it from them and hand it to another customer waiting inside! Yuck..  When we finally got our order we just checked to make sure we had recorded the correct flavored and you guessed it! We recorded the wrong flavor. Smh! There's 6 people working and only 4 orders being worked on, sad!  They def need better management.  Third time here and all experiences were the same. Third time deserved a warning review! Be prepared to wait 30+ minutes for your food and don't be surprised if you get the wrong flavor.

Love the pizza here!!!! If you like a thin crispy crust this is the place for you!  The unlimited toppings with no extra charge is a plus as well.  Prices are reasonable and staff is always helpful when you can't decide what to pick :)   My new fav place!

My boyfriend delivers beer here and told me about it. I was hesitant to try it out at first, but am happy we did. The atmosphere is so much fun to just relax and enjoy some games while drinking and eating.  They had life size connect four, jenga, and shuffle board to name a few.   I tried the seared salmon burger which was delicious. The salmon was crispy and the bun super soft. I would ask for light tarter sauce next time, but definitely a dish I would order again. My boyfriend ordered the burger which was juicy and flavorful as well. We sat at the bar and service was awesome.   We got a tour of the cigar lounge which was restored and still has adobe walls exposed.   Lovely little gem, I would gladly visit and share with friends and family!
