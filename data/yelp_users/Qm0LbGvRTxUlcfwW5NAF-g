This is my go to nail place!  They are located beside one of my favorite spots in PHX, so it usually works out perfectly.  I work in healthcare so my hands take some serious abuse. My favorite part to their manicures is the time they spend on my horrible cuticles.   I wouldn't pay as much attention to the negative reviews, I have been going to this place for 6 months and have yet to have any issue.

Hands down the best sushi ever!!!! I have been there at least 5 times in the last 6 months. Things you should know about me. 1. I LOVE sushi. 2. I have eaten sushi at SEVERAL different places. 3. I do not throw around the phrase 'best ever' lightly! 4. I HATE spicy tuna, or tuna in general.   My first time I went here, I was skeptical. Let's be honest, it is not the prettiest place and it is in a strip mall.  When I looked at the menu and saw the majority of the rolls had either spicy tuna or regular tuna - I was worried. ( Please reference #4 above) However, two of my favorite rolls are the green apple roll and the Primo roll... Both have tuna in them. I have taken two out of town guests here, ironically also NOT tuna fans. Both have adored this venue.   The only roll I was not a fan of had a fried green pepper and a sweet sauce on top. My recommendations/endorsements would be - Grand Canyon roll, primo roll, val vista roll, killer roll, dynamite scallops (ask for them to be served over rice!) green apple roll, green apple roll, green apple roll  - did I mention the green apple roll????

Was told one rate and were forced to pay another price upon arrival. The entire place reeked of weed. We tried the buffet which came out to $50 for 2- it was about the same level of quality as Golden Corral both the food and the service.  Never again will I stay here!

Very fun atmosphere. Went there with a friend just looking to have a couple drinks on a Friday night. We were pleasantly surprised they also has a live band which was pretty awesome.  The cocktail menu had several tempting... But we decided on giving the nachos a try. We were shocked how great they were. LOADS of cheese... And the portion was too big for us to finish. Of course it was our second dinner of the night. Had I not killed a whole pizza by myself just a few hours before I probably could have finished it.

Over rated. I'm gluten free for medical reasons. Those reasons being I get food poisoning like symptoms when I consume too much gluten.   I ordered the Fondue appetizer and asked for veggies to go with it as a substitution. I don't think my waitress understood this. Which caused me to have to remind her AGAIN when the appetizer came out.   There were only a handful of meal options, so I went with a salad which had delicious candied almonds. It is sad when that is the highlight of a meal.   The service was horrible. We had an appetizer, two well drinks, two salads and our bill was almost $70.   The worst part of the experience is that I have been sick for 12 hours after leaving there. If you have a gluten issue I would highly recommend not going to this place.

This is my go to place for Pho!!! I've also had the rice salad from here which was equally delicious.  Because I am gluten intolerant when ever I am sick I always crave Pho... I seriously can not count the number of times we have ordered take out from here. The service is always spot on!!!

This was the biggest disappointment since moving to Scottsdale. The reviews on Yelp made this place seem amazing. I took the advice and ordered the pork tacos and table side guacamole. The table side guac wasnt even made table side. The tacos came out as a chunk of pork roast, not shredded, it be slow cooked for hours, it was tough. I have made more tender pork at home in the crock pot. The tortillas were served on a salt brick, which was beautiful. However the taste, made me crave the prepackaged tortillas from Fry's. Dinner for four came to over $100, and we were all less than impressed. My advice, go around the corner to Rehab burger!

This is my current place to beat in Scottsdale for brunch. The portions are huge. We went there to kick off a friend's birthday weekend with a Saturday brunch. We had a party of around 10 and had an hour wait, really the only downside. Luckily, most of the crew going was running behind any way. I was able to sample a couple of the eggs Benedict - all amazing. I ordered an omelette with Salmon - delicious. However, the winner for that day was the breakfast nachos!!!!

FINALLY!!!!!   I moved to PHX about 6 months ago. Obviously, I expected to find lots of great Mexican places. So, on a Friday afternoon I had some extra time and a strong craving for Mexican. When I found out Guy from DDD had paid this place a visit, I had to give it a whirl.  First - it is TINY! I actually drove right past it the first time. The service was top notch with my waitress guiding me thru the menu. Unfortunately, at the time I am *starving* so looking at all the possibilities and making a decision is practically impossible.  About that time, the waitress walks past me with a quesadilla... It was love at first sight!!!!! And again at first bite!!! I went with the pork shoulder with pineapple. The thing about these quesadillas - think a Mexican version of a calzone! Which is basically pure magic. I can usually put down some serious food - I could barely finish 1/2 of the quesadilla.   Based upon the reviews, I had to order the Horcheta. WOW! They were not exaggerating about the size. It was a steal for $4.   My only regret was that I only had room for the Horcheta for desert. I saw another table with what i assumed was tres leeche cake - it looked delicious!!!! Next time perhaps.  This is my current place to beat for Mexican. 1000X's better than The Mission... Especially considering dinner for 4 at The Mission was $100+.... Here it would have been maybe $50.

I came in around 3p during the week. I really wanted a cupcake but found theirs looked rather small and lacking. I decided to go with a donut and their version of a Twinkie.   The donut was not a donut. It was cake in the shape of a donut. No, not a cake donut.... Cake!! This has become some what of a pet peeve of mine with being gluten free. Every time I have found gluten free donuts they are not at all like the donuts you would find at Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts. Honestly, it's as annoying as when I ask if something is gluten free and the response is yes - it's organic or yes it's vegan. Thanks!!! Because that's EXACTLY the same thing!!!!! Smh.  The Twinkie was fairly dried out and the filling was a weird sweetness that was too sweet to be icing.   I took a couple bites of each and decided they were not worth the calories. Honestly, my money would have been better spent on the 4 pk of cupcakes at Trader Joe's. However, I am a sucker for supporting local.   Bottom Line - huge disappointment. The search for a gluten free bakery in PHX continues.

Quick service for a great deal. Purchased the VIP service regularly $20, $17 with coupon from Yelp - WOW! Wash, wax, vacuum, tires cleaned... Much better than other places I've tried that charged as much for half the services!

Went there on Mother's Day for brunch with some friends. We were worried about it being a holiday how long the wait would be. To our pleasant surprise, the staff was extremely accommodating and seated us right away at a fun table/Foosball table. Our orders included: The Mac n cheese burger, Nutella Cream cheese stuffed French toast, and a cheddar bacon omelette. All of them were delicious... We didn't realize there is a Nutella cream cheese, which threw us off. We thought it said Nutella AND cream cheese. Where can we buy this stuff in bulk????? Also, on Sundays they have $15 mimosas with penny refills!!! Which the bartender adjusted to our taste as far as ratio of OJ. Be cautious, we had one mixed drink other than mimosas and it was PACKED with ice, next time we will ask for light ice. Also, I expected more bacon in the cheddar bacon omelette. BUT - I would also order everything again and highly recommend it!

Ok before you read this review you have to know a couple things about me.   1. I am gluten intolerant. Really! Not the people who just leave out bread and pasta and think gluten isn't in practically every processed food including broth.  2. I am a country girl. I believe people should not be judged by the amount of butter they consume. I believe everything can be made better by being batter dipped and fried.   So, I moved to PHX from VA in 2015. My hunt began for a decent gluten free bakery. On a Tuesday, I had extra time in the morning so, I consulted with Yelp and decided to give Jewel's a chance.  I hadn't even looked at the menu when I approached the cashier. I was speechless when he told me the entire menu is gluten free. All the cupcakes, brownies... Donuts (and real donuts not cake in the shape of a donut like all the other gluten free donuts I've seen).... All of it Gluten Free. In a rush to decide, when I saw chicken and waffles - I had to give them a try.   Have I mentioned my belief system on everything is better with a batter???? Also, I make some BOMB fried chicken and come from a family who can throw down on some soul food. So, to say my standards are high, is an under statement.   Oh... My... God.... Praise the sweet 8 lb 7 oz baby Jesus.... These were the best chicken and waffles I have ever had in my life. Separately, the waffle was light and chewy - just a dream!!!! The chicken had just enough batter and flavor. Then the dish came with two sauces a lemony honey one I dipped the waffle in which had just enough sweetness. Then there was a spicy honey one for the chicken.... Because every southern knows fried chicken and hot sauce are a married couple!!!! An added bonus was the fried Kale that was on top. It added a lovely flavor contrast but didn't take away from the dish.  I also adored the style of the place. Mismatched chairs surrounding tables. The place supports all local suppliers - which I have noticed is rare to find in AZ. I think I have found my new favorite place, I will definitely be back!!!

Waited for almost 15 min after being seated... No one spoke to me or even took my drink order while others were seated and drinks were brought to them. No thank you!!!!

Do not go there... Went with a coworker, we were both sick for the rest of the day. I had the fish tacos which decided to swim up stream later in the day. Plush there was only one person acting as our waitress, hostess, server and I'm fairly certain she was the cook also.
