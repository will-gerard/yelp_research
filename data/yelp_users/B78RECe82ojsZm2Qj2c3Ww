The long line moved slow and when I noticed that the employees had no sense of urgency, moving at a snail's pace I understood why.  I got a salad which was okay, my husband the burrito and my son a tiny kids meal which still left him hungry. The drink station was cool but pricey.  The employees were not friendly, never said thank you or smiled.  They acted like they were doing US a favor.    Next time we will just stick with Chipotle.

This place is the "sake" bomb!  The sushi was very fresh and presentation was very nice.  The customer service was outstanding.  Great atmosphere as well.   Definitely a great place for your sushi fix!

Best Pho I've had! Fresh ingredients and broth and noodles just right.  Staff is very friendly and food comes out fast.

Dee-lish! This is hands down one of the best places for Ph贸. It's a hole-in-the-wall place (I think an old Taco Bell) the guy who runs the place works his tail off as hostess,  server and cashier. The Ph贸 here has such fresh ingredients and is to your table in no time! Pretty  fast service especially considering how busy they get.    If you're looking for a fancy place with friendly service then go elsewhere. If you want some fresh,  delicious, fast Ph贸 then this is your place Ph贸 sho!

Amy does such a wonderful job on my hair. She listens to me, delivers and has great suggestions. Her shampooing skills are AMAZINGLY relaxing, like a spa massage ahhhhh. I've had Amy color, cut and style my hair about 5 times and have left happy every single time!

I don't know what I was thinking going to this place.  The red flag should've been the 300 lb man waddling out of the restaurant still shoving his face with pizza.     It is the Walmart of pizza places. If cold, cheap, cracker-like pizza is worth being surrounded by trash then  this place is right up your alley, literally.    Never again.

If you want the experience of "revolving" sushi then this the place. If you don't mind over priced, subpar sushi on that conveyor belt that is. The whole experience in my book was somewhat distracting . The service was absolutely terrible. The waiter was not friendly and was not knowledgeable of the sushi.   Overall good for a one time experience but we won't go back.  I'll forgo the conveyor belt for better sushi and a better atmosphere any time!

Great, trendy place to get your Carribean comfort food. Really good  for vegetarians and meat eaters. I had Achioto empanada and my husband  had the lunch special  which came with your choice  of 2 empanadas, rice and beans for $7.95. We shared the appetizers  combo caribe which although was over priced was very good. Good, fast service and establishment was clean and upbeat.
