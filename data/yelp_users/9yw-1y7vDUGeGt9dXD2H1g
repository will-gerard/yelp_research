My husband and I came looking for Pad Thai, which we both ordered as a main dish.  The ambiance was very quaint and the service was prompt and kind.   I started with a salad with peanut sauce, and it was absolutely delicious. I ate the entire thing, which is rare for me with a salad.  The Pad Thai was not as good. The chicken was of a very low grade and did not have a good flavor. I was so put off by the chicken that I could not bring myself to try the shrimp in the dish.  The noodles had kind of a dirty taste with an odd flavor that is difficult to articulate.  Even the water had a strange rotten taste to it, so much so that I stuck with soda which came from a can.  If I went back, I would only get the salad.    We ended up getting burgers after we left since neither of us could stomach the pad thai.

Who knew vegan food could be so flavorful and yummy?  The service is also above and beyond what you'd normally get at a casual or even a sit down restaurant.

The best drive thru restaurant around.  Never get sick of coming here and the service is exceptional compared to other chain drive thrus.

I love Mellow Mushroom.  I can't eat there often because I would be morbidly obese, but there is nothing like the Buffalo Chicken pizza there.  I've never had an issue with their service - it has always been good.

This place gets crazy busy sometimes, but it is generally worth the wait.  I would highly recommend the crepes for breakfast, and I've never had a coffee drink there that I didn't like.

Yum!  I was in the neighborhood for auto repairs and I'm glad I stopped.  The carne asada tacos and mini quesadilla totally hit the spot.

I was dreading taking my car in to have the broken air conditioning fixed, fearing a serious issue after a non successful at home recharge attempt.  I'm so glad I came to this place because I was in and out in an hour for a fair price!  I would definitely come back, and I see why this place is well-reviewed.

This is a little bit different of an option when you feel like pizza.  It is casual and inexpensive, and you can choose your ingredients.  My husband and I have been a couple of times and built a delicious pizza on both occasions.

I heard good things from several coworkers about this place and took my friends to check it out.  We weren't disappointed.  The team service concept (we had several servers) seemed a little disorganized and disjointed, but it was Saturday evening so it was understandable that they were busy and not able to be super attentive.   The drinks were good and we ordered several apps that were quite tasty.   For the ambiance and area you get, the prices are not too bad.   The craziest part is the people watching.  My group was probably the youngest in the restaurant with the most original unaltered body parts.
