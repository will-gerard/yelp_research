The food is amazing. I have never hade a macaroon that was so yummy. The breakfast is the best part. I would say that the cost for the portions you get is a bit high but the quality is there.

Worst experience ever. We planned to stay 3 nights. When we first walked in the Ac filter looked like it hadn't been changed in 2 years. The quickly replaced it. Then the AC broke. Instead of putting us in a new room they sent someone to fix it hours later and it didn't work. Then it took about another 5 hours to get us a new room. The new room had a huge leak in the sink and water went everywhere. On top of that the pool by our room flooded and they closed it. Then another pool was closed for a private party. The main pool was disgusting. Was super cloudy had floating bandaids and dead bees everywhere. Then I went to speak with a manager and check out and no manager or assistant manager or any one of authority was available to speak with. I will never stay here again. It is also in a rundown part of town.

The service here is awesome. The owner makes you feel welcome and appreciated. Pizza is made fresh. It is good pizza and the service makes it great. The wings are awesome.

This is the slowest most unorganized domino's I have ever been in. Service is terrible. They can't even fold the boxes right. There aren't many pizza joints to choose from out here but I wouldn't choose this one. Also when did they start charging for crushed red peppers and parm. cheese. That is just dumb.

Terrible service. Never came to refill water had to walk around to find 7 people standing in the back doing nothing. Pancakes were uncooked, kids food came out cold. Didn't bring all of our food. Sent food back because it was uncooked and they never came back out. Worst Denney s I have ever been to.

There drive through staff is terrible. Never get orders right and they repeat the wrong orders about 10 times.  I have never gone here and got an order right.

Overpriced. Several times I have ordered a sandwich and one entire half has had no meat. They are careless and try to go to fast and it comprises the food. They smother everything  in mayo. Was excited for a new place out here but am always disappointed.

This kneaders is always disappointing. We go long periods of time in between going and each time we go we remember why we don't. They have never gotten my order right yet. Apparently no mayo and no onions means more mayo and more onions. We were the only people there and it still took 20 minutes for them to make our order (and made it wrong). I am officially done with this place.

Food was good as always. It was pretty busy all the available tables were dirty. Let manager know he cleaned a table for us right away. Then our food took longer than it should have to get out. I am giving 4 stars because even though there was issues the manager recognized it without us complaining and gave us free entree certificates and was very apologetic.

took my wife and 3 kids for breakfast at dinner time. The employees were very nice and helpful but....my wife found a long hair in her eggs, they forgot to take the kids meals off the cost (kids eat free happy hour) I gave the waiter $10 for being so polite but then they charged my card twice. I then sat on hold for 10 minutes the following day to try to resolve. the manager said I would have to bring my bank statement in so she could send it to corporate and get it fixed. What a nightmare.
