Friend recommended this place since my place I was going to never could do all that fun stuff I found on pinterest.   Jenny did my nails and she told me to just show her a pic of what I wanted.  I did and she did exact same design in no time at all!  I was so happy with my results.   Going to try an ombr√© on my nails next time in.

I don't believe the women here are weak.  I have been to Bernadette and Lucinda and both women are amazing massage therapist.  I use to manage spas, so I have had lots of massages in the past.  These women are two of the best massage therapist I've encountered.    And..... They always ask about pressure during the massage. Sometimes they don't even need to ask because they can tell how my body reacts.  Definitely would recommend booking an appt!

Customer service sucked at the bar.   Employees didn't seem happy at all.  Heard them bitching and complaining by the computer.  Over this place. I'll go back to Marjorie's where the staff seemed happy to see everyone and excited they were getting business

Henna Happy Hour!  Never heard of it?  well I'm a fan because it's different!  Glass of wine and a henna tattoo for $10 starting at 6pm on Thursdays.  We got there early to enjoy happy hour first which is 3-6pm. $4 glasses of wine!  The food was flavorful but what really made the experience is the staff.  Everyone was so friendly and easy to talk to.  Suggested things on the menu that they really enjoyed and helped me make my decision on dinner which I had the Salmon and loved!

This place is my new favorite breakfast joint!  Mimosa glasses....LARGE!  Thank u for that! We started at the bar which was easy to get into because there was a break between chairs in the middle so that people on the wait can get to it easier.  We waited 30mins for a table but this place was well worth the wait. And the drinks are big so they lasted. Friend got a bacon Bloody Mary and was pleased with the flavors The Chilaquiles Benedict was amazing. Hash browns cooked just right! Asked for an expresso martini and they said "sure! What's in it?"  I told them.... And it wAs made perfect but not in a martini glass but a glass. And who cares. It was cold and yummy!  Our server Alex (I believe his name was) provided amazing and friendly service

Basil grilled chicken baguette...... Amazing   Expresso martini.... Amazing!  And.... Service from Beth behind the bar who I have encountered twice now flying out.... So personable and down to earth.  I myself work in the industry and it's hard going out because I pick things out constantly about what is wrong.  There was nothing wrong about my experience today.  Next time I fly out hopefully it's in the C terminal of southwest and I get to come back!

The food was amazing.  The attitudes of the service people..... A little hum drum.  Maybe the AZ heat is just getting to them.  But I like to go into a place and get smiles
