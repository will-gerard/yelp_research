**WARNING***DO NOT BUT APPLIANCES HERE!!!  I recently purchased a dishwasher for over $1300 at Home Depot. I have shopped there for a very long time and never had issues with returning things on occasion if need be. I looked around at both Best Buy and Lowes and was told the return policy on all appliances was 30 days if I needed to bring it back for any reason. I wrongly assumed that Home Depot would do the same because of this and my past experiences. When I tried returning it 4 days after delivery, I discovered you cannot return appliances for any reason. I cannot express how devastated I am that because I chose to purchase the dishwasher from Home Depot, I am out over $1400 (including delivery and installation). I spoke with customer service and was told that management was unwilling to allow me to return it because I purchased online and said there store would "have to take the hit". So instead they would rather lose a long time customer. I will NEVER again shop at Home Depot for anything.

The plumber I had to work with was extremely unreliable. Several times this person has stood me up and wasted my time. The plumber I was passed off to call is not good at getting back to me at all, even after I call several times. It's sad this company had to lose so much money because of a lack of care for my business and for the unreliability of it's employees.

I don't know what happened to this place, but I ordered take out today and it barely had any taste! I got General Tso chicken and it was super dry, and fried rice, which didn't have any flavor at all. I've gone hear before and the food was just ok, but this time was really bad.

George came over today with another person (I forgot his name) and put up used cabinets. They were pretty worn out but both of them did a really great job on putting them up! They look amazing. George and his teammate were both very fast and efficient and did a good job on making everything fit together really nicely. The price he charged me was also under the estimate he originally quoted, which was a huge blessing. I would highly recommend this company and will definitely be using their services again!

I was very pleased with the service I received from Taurus! The guys were very nice and they were very quick! I had to have a treadmill and elliptical moved up the stairs and they were able to get it up there with very little problem. Also, they were way earlier than anticipated and I appreciated that they called to let me know instead of standing me up and deciding it wasn't worth their time. I also had them move everything out of my garage. I was pretty nervous that they were going to take there sweet time so they could charge more, but there as none of that. They were here and gone in just about an hour! Very pleased and will be using this service again.

Matt came out to install plumbing in my garage for a utility sink. I was very pleased on the work that he did. Very good job. He was on time and was nice and professional. I would definitely recommend this company. Price was fair as well.
