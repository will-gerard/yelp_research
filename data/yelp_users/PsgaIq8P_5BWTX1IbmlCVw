My husband and I have been here numerous times but tonight had to have been our best experience yet! We were greeted my one of the new owners, David, who personally recommended the specials... Blackened salmon on garlic mashed potatoes and the crabcake on avacado corn salad. Both entrees were perfect! Perfect size, perfect taste!  Because the portion sizes were actually normal, we also treated ourselves to desserts... Carrot cake and BlackBerry lemon bars...o...m...g.... They were both to die for!  I highly recommend the BlackBerry lemon bar if you prefer tart to sweet desserts... Excellent!!!   While we were digesting our scrumptious dinner the owner came by again and spent time discussing their new decor and how the try to buy locally... Which explains the fresh food!   Now I'm almost done, but like every other time I chime here I can't leave without taking home a salt river bar... They are some of the best things I've ever tasted... I took home two... One to share with a friend so I can get her addicted too!   My suggestion... Go at off times... The place gets packed and if your impatient or in a hurry this is not the place to go... It's meant to be enjoyed and relaxed... No fast food... No hurry... Just a great dining experience!

I came to this salon after being recommended by a friend who is a frequent customer.  I admit the place was very clean and comfortable.  I got a basic pedicure with a specific design.  My daughter came with us and got the same.  My pedicure was ok.  My tech spent a lot of time on one leg but hardly any on the other.  When it came to the design part, the tech had a lot of problems even with step by step pics I had on my phone. Luckily the owner came over and did it for him.  My daughter had a couple issues..I don't like my cuticles cut and asked not to have hers done either...they didn't do mine but they did hers which resulted in a painful and swollen ingrown toenail that took about a month to heal.  When it came to paying I didn't have any cash.  They advised you can't tip on a credit card and they told me to go get money for the tip and come back. Uh huh...I left and never returned and don't plan on it.

I was driving home and noticed my "low tire pressure" light on. Since I live close by, I stopped in here to see if they could check it for me.  They were fantastic! Not only checked all my tires but inflated them and let me know how often I should check them and what the pressure should be. I think I knew most of it but I really appreciated their helpfulness and kindness! Will defiantly keep this in mind when I'm in need of new tires!

I go here almost weekly...usually get just the basic wash. They do what I expect them to...My car always looks great...only thing I don't like is their cinnamon smell, skip it and buy your own! :)

We are almost done with our second daughter getting her full set of braces completed and couldn't be happier! The staff here is fantastic and always remembers us when we show up. The treatment is fast and effective and the appointment times are so convenient!  Would totally recommend Dr Matt to anyone, child or adult, needing orthodontic treatment! A+

My daughter and I have been going to a certain nail place for years but the service was starting to go downhill. We saw this place and thought we'd try it out and we are so glad we did!  The hot stone pedicure was fantastic and my daughter's custom One Direction manicure turned out perfect! Will definitely become a regular!  Now if you like chatty techs this place is not for you. All the techs seemed quiet but friendly and really seemed to be focused on their tasks. My daughter wanted a very specific design on her nails and they did an EXCELLENT job and didn't even charge us extra! Will definitely be going back!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I've had my nails done before and was never very happy with the results...after going here I have never been happier! The service is excellent...the atmosphere is hip and modern ... even for an old lady like me! The only negative I have is the parking situation...it's all metered but if you ask the guys for a parking pass you can bypass that little annoyance!   I highly recommend these guys! You can't go wrong!!!

Have already been here twice... First to the VIP opening (thanks to my daughter who works here) and then again for dinner. Both times the food was great! Chicken is Super fresh and so are the veggies! Both times I got build your own bowls...mmmmmm!!!  I have a friend who had severe dietary restrictions and this is the perfect place! They do everything they can to accommodate food allergies and restrictions without sacrificing taste!  so glad to have a healthy alternative "fast food" place in the area! Go to Joe's!!!
