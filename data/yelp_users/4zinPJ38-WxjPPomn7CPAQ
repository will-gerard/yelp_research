Great bread baked on site?   Super fresh mozzarella, tomatoes & basil?  Available fresh fruit and salads.  This place is right up the alley for those that are looking for a healthier alternative to lunch in CenPho.    My only beef with Pane Bianco is the lack of choice.  They have a couple sandwiches, a couple salads and that's about it.  Now, what they do make is really good (along with the caprese sandwich, I suggest the sopprasetta- amazingly good salami- and provolone), I just wish they made more of it.    Also, be aware, this isn't a sit-down place.  You order, pay, have a quick convo with one of the friendly staffmembers and take away.  From there, you can choose to take it with you to wherever or eat on the picnic benches shared with Lux with the lovely backdrop of Central Ave construction.

Warning:  Do not wear a white shirt.  Continuing to scour the valley for Chicago food, I stumbled on A&J.    *stares at sign*  "Chicago Style Bar B Q"     hmmm.  I lived in Chicago almost my entire life, and I have no idea what this means.  I've heard of Chicago style hot dogs, pizza and beef and KC & Memphis style BBQ, but never Chicago style BBQ.    First thing you notice are the smells- Oh the glorious smells- that hit you from the parking lot.  It's a pretty simple place, really.  Slow cooked pork, beef, chicken and ribs.  Take your pick, it'll be slathered in tasty BBQ sauce.

So close!!!!!  For the last 15 months, I've been searching the valley looking for a passable italian beef sandwich.  I think I found it at Luke's.  It's not great, it's not amazing, it's not orgasmic, but it's good.  Ok, so probably somewhere in between good and very good.    The beef here is about as close to Chicago style as you're going to get; thinly sliced, properly seasoned with some nice sweet peppers.  The bread is a little different than I'm used to, most Chicago places serve their beefs on an 8'' roll that is close to a bratwurst roll.  Luke's serves theirs on about a foot long thing that resembles french bread.    The sandwich is authentically messy and drippy.  Please don't expect to eat this daintily.  It does not happen.  Roll up your sleeves and bring extra napkins.    I'll be back when I need a fix and don't mind eating an entire day's worth of calories in one sitting.

Hzappy Paczki Dzay Evzerzybodyzy!!!!  So, if you're from one of the cities back east with a large Polish population (like Chicago), Paczkis are pretty much a staple for Fat Tuesday.  For those of you unfamiliar, it's pretty much a filled donut, but they're really good, and made even more special because you can only ever get them 1 day a year.    I was told on good authority that Europa is *the* place to go in the valley for real Polish fare, and it certainly didn't disappoint.  They had a whole case of authentic looking Polish baked things like Paczkis and Kolachkis and other things I can't spell or pronounce, but also have lots of Ks, Zs and Is in their names.  From what I saw, the paczkis they had were:  raspberry, prune, cherry & cream cheese, apple, custard, strawberry & probably a few more I'm forgetting.   They also had a little Polish deli with more food I won't even attempt to spell, but it certainly seemed authentic.  Lots of sausages and meats and things.     Also, even the people that worked there were authentically Polish!  Well, I'm assuming so, at least.  They were white and spoke with accents I couldn't understand, but reminded me of the northwest side of Chicago.    Go forth and enjoy the fatty deliciousness that is the Paczki before you have to do the whole "Lent" thing, if that's the sort of thing you're into.  If not, enjoy it without having to do any of that pesky fasting.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken, which is apparently their specialty, and priced accordingly.  It was $7 for a medium sized bowl and drink.  The chicken was mediocre and the rice was kinda gummy.    Even still, this wouldn't have warranted the one star until I bit into a chunk of bone that they forgot to sift out.  Nasty.

Probably just north of 3 stars, but rounded up for the excellent service.    We got here a bit early for an 8 o clock reservation and decided to hit the bar area.  Be warned, it's not a huge bar area- only 3 tables or so and maybe 10 stools at the bar.  The wait staff there was excellent.  I ordered a pretty simple Hendrick's & Tonic (any place that carries Hendrick's is alright with me), but my friend ordered a specialized drink of 1 part Hendrick's & 2 part Ketel one, shaken, no garnish, with half poured and the other half chilled in a shot glass sitting in a tumbler of ice water.  SHEESH, talk about high maintenance, but they gladly made it and made it to a T.    The steaks themselves were ok.  For the price you pay (~$40 for my bone-in ribeye), you can get a better steak just down the street at Donovan's.  Also, they don't serve any complimentary sides or anything with the steak, unless you order them.  It's just the steak on a plate of sizzling butter.  Quite gluttonous.    I did save a little room for dessert.  I split a flourless chocolate cake with a hint of espresso and a strawberry drizzle.  It was absolutely awesome, and probably the best part of the meal, which, for a steakhouse, probably isn't a rousing endorsement.

Probably my favorite of the breakout of "fresh-mex" type places.   This place is very similar in layout to a Baja Fresh, except they haven't sold their soul to Wendy's like Baja Fresh did.    The quality of food here is really good.   I especially enjoy the carne asade tacos with a little salsa verde on it.   Thinking about it makes me want to go get some right now, except that it's about 930, and they're likely closed.  I never get the guac, but I've been told it's very fresh and very good.

Very good place for breakfast & lunch tucked away in the crowded shops at 44th & Camelback.  I kinda found this place on accident.  I meant to just run into AJs and grab a salad to go, but was forced to park basically across the driveway from Taylor's, and, being closer, I opted to go there instead.    Taylor's is open 6-4ish (I couldn't really tell, they probably just changed the hours and scratched off the hour number on the door), and they serve breakfast all day- well, all day they're actually open- which is always good with me.    I was in the mood for corned beef, and , bingo, there it was.  Nice mound of lean tasty beef with melty cheese (no saurkraut or thousand island, please.).  And the bread- oh the bread- grilled to be crispy on the edges but still soft inside.  How in the hell do they do it?  I don't know, but I'm in love.

Oh man, if you don't especially like your heart  (or at least can justify it by working out after), this is an awesome place.  I've been extremely skeptical of "Chicago" places here in the valley, because most are bad impressions, at best.  This place doesn't *quite* get it, but it's the closest I've found in Phoenix.    Of course, they've got the Chicago street signs and sports posters.  Hey!  Southport!  I lived right by there!  In case you missed the name of the place, they like reminding you by filling your vision with schtick.  The sliders, which aren't really known as a Chicago thing, are really good, and quite cheap.  These are really tasty little burgers that make an inexpensive meal.    The italian beef, which *IS* a Chicago staple, just isn't quite right.  I think I figured out what it is.  The beef isn't sliced thinly enough and they don't use enough spices, which makes for a store-bought kinda feel to it.    Props for the tasty milkshake, though.    I really, really want to find a place in Phoenix to get a beef sandwich.   My search did not end here.    I am Sean's unfulfilled yearning.

Phoenix has pretty slim pickings when it comes to good pizza, or at least pizza that I'm accustomed to.  Rosati's, while not quite what I'm used to, is the best representation of Chicago style pizza that I've found.    The Chicago style deep dish is good.  The toppings, especially the sausage, are plentiful and tasty and the sauce is good.  I think the crust is what is a bit off.    Overall, Rosati's is still my choice for pizza in the valley.

Ok, so Phoenix has no great Chicago pizza, no good Chicago hot dogs and I haven't found a place that has an even passable Chicago beef, but it does have one thing Chicago doesn't-  In N Out.    The one I was at is in Tempe, but I'm too lazy to add it.   They're all over the place, I'm sure you've seen them.

I'll give it to Taste of Chicago, it looks the part.  Chicago sports stuff- check!  And that's where the Chicago similarities end.  As I must do for any place that claims "Chicago", I tried the Italian beef.  Hmmmm.... notsomuch.  Pretty bland, overly chewy, too thickly sliced.  Wait.  Is this store bought?  You really shouldn't have to wonder that.

I wouldn't say I'm agoraphobic, I just don't like masses of humanity buzzing around me, and Arizona Mills is ALWAYS full of people.    This place is gigantic and circular, with streams of people going in every which way.  I feel like I'm in a roller derby when I go into this place.  It's definitely the place to hangout, which results in packs of teens randomly standing in clumps among the rat race.    Regarding the stores, there are plenty of outlet deals, but not a whole lot of stores I'd really shop at in the first place (who puts a Sports Authority in a mall?!).    Oh, and the parking is atrocious.

I would have never have even known about this place without this website.  It's tucked in the corner of a stripmall, pretty much across the parking lot from a Starbucks.  I wish I could sit in front of that store and direct them across the way to a place where your coffee doesn't taste like someone burned it.    I've had several drinks here, all have been good.  Pastries are always freshly made.    It's probably really a 4 star-ish place, but they get the extra star because the girl making my drink was wearing an Illini shirt.  Definite bonus points.

Very unassuming from the outside, Bella Luna is actually located at the end of a Safeway shopping center.   However, everything else about this place is great.  I've eaten here 4 or 5 times, trying something new everytime and have not eaten one thing that hasn't been great.  The wine list is rather large for a smallish restaurant.  The service at Bella Luna is also top-notch.  The wait staff is attentive and flexible to requests, and the owners (a husband and wife) will often swing by during the meal to see how everything is.     Prices are also reasonable with most entrees running in the $10-$18 range.  The only drawback is the size.  It's not a huge place, so call ahead or come early.    I suggest:   Veal Saltimbocca-  All of their meat is very good. Tournados-  Will usually only appear as a special, though the chef can usually make it for you if requested. Lasagne al forno-  Just like home.  Tiramisu-  Fantastic.  Not too coffee-ey.

psssst.... c'mere...... let me let you in on something kinda cool.  Medizona might be the best restaurant you've never heard of.  I mean, really, how is this place not huge?!   I don't have the descriptors to let you know how much I like this place.    The food here is creative, attractively presented and fantastic on the palate.  It's southwestern and mediterrenean.  Yeah, "huh?"  I know.  I had the same reaction.  It's like Chino Bandido, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't sound like it'd work, but it does.  Go try it for yourself.   Ratatouille quesadilla.  Chorizo potato cake.  Lamb with a moussaka tart with red pepper sauce. And, of course, the prickly pear tiramisu.  Go.   Tonight.

Take the word "bowl" away, and it goes from crap to awesome.     Very Benihana in nature, but I thought the food was superior to Benihana, and, best of all, $4 for a 22oz Kieren and sake.  Awesome deal.     Of course, the table-side entertainment was fun.  They set the table on fire and made a volcano out of an onion.  Fun stuff.

You're not gonna find this place from the street.  I barely found this place and I knew where I was going.  Well, sort of.   I knew it was in the Scottsdale Seville shopping center (another upscale outdoor minimall in at Scottsdale Rd & Indian Bend).  I walked around for a few minutes till I located a map.  Ah.  It's about 50 feet right in front of me.  Gotcha.  I had lunch here with a friend, and their menu, while pretty limited for lunch, is still pretty good.  They have a wide selection of handmade, brick oven pizzas and salads (not made in the brick oven).  You can also get a personal size pizza and salad for like $7.  Not too shabby.  I did exactly that and was quite full by the time it was all done.  If you want to get a proper salad (not the side version), they're meal-sized.   2 things outshined the food here, though:  1- big patio perfect for an outdoor lunch on a 75 degree afternoon. 2- great service.  there were only a couple people working, but they were seemingly everywhere at just the right time.  my glass was never more than 1/4 empty without an offer of a refill, my order was taken right after i'd decided and my bill was presented just as i was reaching for my wallet.    odd that good service, designed to be not noticed, was the first thing i noticed.

I probably should have studied up a little more on this place before deciding 8 o clock on a friday as a good meeting time.  Yeah, not the best time to go.  I'd been there around normal bar hours before, but totally forgot about the whole "restaurant" aspect of the place.  The time we went is kind of the odd in between time of people going to eat dinner and people still there for happy hour, so it was pretty packed.  There were several groups of people waiting for tables to eat when we got there.  Good thing we were invited to try to find a seat on the bar.   *Try* being the operative word.  It's a huge bar in the middle of the floor, with seating on 3 sides, but there weren't any seats at all.  Hmm.   So, my friend and I got to enjoyed our first brewery crafted treat standing in between a few tables, with the seated patrons kinda checking the two of us out like, "dumbass... didn't you realize it'd be this full?"  *shrug*  Thankfully, after about 15 minutes a couple seats at the bar opened up.  Hooray!    I suggest the Oatmeal Stout, Kiltlifter and Hefeweizen.  All are really good, and priced nicely at less than $4.  How cool is that?  Warning- parking here isn't the best.  You probably will be parking on the street and you probably will have to walk a block or two.  Don't be all shocked by this.  In fact, if your walk is less than 5 minutes, you did well.

Definitely a break from the usual Subway or Jimmy Johns.  They have an expansive sandwich menu and on top of it, they're good.  The bread is awesome, even when toasted.    The only drawback was that it took a long time to get my order, but then again, it's probably because I went at the height of lunch rush.

I dig this place.  Perfect location right in the middle of the strip.  Least amount of walking from your room to gambling. Friendly staff (always willing to help, quick and strong with the drinks, talkative dealers) Clean rooms with flat screens.   Cheap. Fat Elvis.  Sure, it's no mega resort.  Sure the gambling floor is small and the restaurants aren't the best.  But, it's one of the hidden gems of the strip that will surely be gone in a few years.    Enjoy it while you can.

One of my favorite places to eat dinner in Vegas.   It's nice without being stuffy, intricately cooked without being pompous and romantic without being kitschy.   You can eat on the patio and enjoy St. Mark's square, or the more formal dining room.  Everything I've eaten here has been great, and very reasonably priced for the quality.   I've had the fliet, the duck and the tilapia (i think... it was like a year and a half ago. i know it was an obscene chunk of delicious fish).  However, the real stars of Postrio, as with any Puck restaurants, are the desserts.  I've twice enjoyed the pistachio gelato with port cherries.  So good.  So very good.  The formal dining room is great for a nice, romantic dinner.  The patio is great for something more laid back.

I don't really do the whole "hang out at a coffeebar" type thing, so my review is based only on the drink itself, which has been awesome every time I've been there.    Best in the valley.   It's a shame Central is such a pain.

I love this place.  It's easily my favorite Mexican food in the valley.  Great service, great guacamole, great margaritas.  I've been here 3 times and have never been disappointed by the entrees.  Be advised, they don't take reservations, and there is usually a wait on the weekends.  However, if you're going mid-week, it's usually pretty easy to get a table.

Hands down the best place I've stayed in Vegas (I have yet to check out the Wynn).  Fantastic staff, fantastic rooms and great ammenities.  The food is top notch and the gaming is as well.    Obviously, the fountain shows are worth standing outside in the heat.    Normally, I would shy away from spending as much as the Bellagio costs, but it's worth it.

Overall a pretty cool place to stay.  However, not the place to go if you're looking to relax- for both the younger clientele and the roller coaster outside the hotel.     Being a new property, the rooms are still relatively lightly tread and the casino is well laid out.  The bars and clubs are fun.  Not amazing, but certainly a fun place.

The food here is very good.  I had a filet with merlot sauce and asparagus that was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.   Others I was with had the scallops, which were raved about, and the escargot, which, while scorching hot, was also good.  I tried my first escargot, just because, you never know what you might like.  Me- Not so much with the escargot.  This place does lose points on the environment.  It's very cramped and noisy.  Not a really good place for a romantic dinner, but a good place for really good eats.

Probably the worst place you could stay in Vegas.  The place is old, dingy and the rooms smell like smoke, the food was nasty and it's very far north.   The only semi-redeeming quality of the place was the fact that it had a decent poker tourney (which you can find at any legit poker room on the strip).  The only way I'd ever stay here again was if every other room on the strip was booked.

Very nice property, the pool is great, rooms are clean and well appointed, the casino is great and the restaurants are decent.    Why 4 stars instead of 5?  It's at the far south end of the strip, which means tons of walking and it's pricey.  Better bang for the buck can be found up the strip for less.

Ok, so this is going to be contrary to several posts I've made-  I enjoyed PCL.    Yes, it's SUPER Scottsdale-y, but I'll be damned if I didn't have a great night.  I think it's because I went in expecting it to completely suck, and I came out pleasantly surprised that I was only kind of aggrivated.  Also, it's a great place to people watch- both for scantily clad young things, and for the unintentionally humorous.  Drinks aren't horribly priced for this area of town... at least I'm assuming so, I don't really recall.  My wallet had more than I expected on Sunday, at least.  In retrospect, I should've busted out the coral shirt.  Maybe next time, PCL, maybe next time.

GET IT?!?  IT'S A EUPHEMISM!!!!!!  *PINK*. TACO. teeeheeeee BRILLIANT!!  As subtle as a fart in a rose garden, there lies Pink Taco on Camelback in Scottsdale, the epitome of style (errr... can you call it "style"?) over substance.  The food here is certainly nothing to write home about.   It's all pretty generic, middle-of-the road mass produced tasting Americanized Mexican food with overpriced theme-y drinks. Oh, and guess what?  It's not cheap.  You're paying for the ambiance (which does include attractive waitresses.... hello, if you're reading this).     All in all, save your cash or go to Los Sombreros.   No hotties in tank tops, but much better food, unless you like overpriced mehworthy vaginal-themed AmeriMex.

I love Chinese food.  I love Mexican food (or at least, Ameri-mex).   What better idea than to put these two together?  These guys are freakin geniuses.  I got jade chicken in a burrito, how cool is that?    It would be 5 stars, but I, honestly, didn't think the food blew me away.  It was good, and it was inventive, but not mindblowing.    One thing I did think was really cool was the little cinnamon flavored hockey puck you get for dessert.  It's not like the southern Snickerdoodles I've had before, but it's odd, which means it perfectly fits.

Yikes.   So, the first room I checked into had black mold on the ceiling of the bathroom.  The room they switched me into had a malfunctioning A/C unit that didn't work, but did leak water all over the carpet.  The 3rd room was actually in decent condition, but was about 200 feet from the interstate.    The gaming floor is limited, but the dealers were pretty nice.

I really dig this place.  Awesome decor, great mood lighting, really tasty menu, expansive wine list.  It's kind of an upscale take on mediterrenean food.  i had the chicken (which was perfectly juicy & tasty) with parmesan risotto & asparagus.  pretty good all the way around.  i'd definitely eat here again.

Huh, so I've never reviewed the Roo?  Well, now seems a good time.    Helpful hint:  First Friday is not a good night to check out the Roo for the first time.  Thankfully, I've been here a few times before last night, so the cramped sweatiness didn't sway my opinion.    This is probably my favorite "house bar" of the area.  I love Lost Leaf, but I think the Roo gets a slight nod because of the beers on tap (lots of great microbrews) vs. bottles & cans at LL (also lots of great microbrews).  My advice is to check this place out on an off night or get there early on a weekend night, or else you'll be standing the whole time.

I'll continue the broken record (get it?  BROKEN RECORD.  MUSIC STORE.  I suck.) and shamelessly laud this place.  Being consistently behind the times, I only found Stinkweeds last week (and that was only due to Yelp- Thanks Yelp!).  I'd been quite frustrated going into big box stores only to find copy after copy of Fergalicious, but no indie rock to speak of.  Stinkweeds is a fresh breath of musical air.  Lesser known bands, discount used copies, workers with great suggestions.    I'll drive the 30 minutes to go here.

A dude playing irish music on a fiddle in a bar in North Phoenix?  Count me in.  This is a pretty good pub-y place with your traditional attempt at irishness (stew, shepherd's pie, bangers & mash) with a few irish beers (guinness, of course, harp & smithwick's) while also having your traditional bar food.  Nothing fancy, everything is pretty straightforward.  Probably really a 3 star place, but the live entertainment adds a bonus star.

What a cool little accident!   What started out as a trip to find the Roosevelt turned into an impromptu journey into the living room of some random guy.  Check that, some random guy who just happens to really like to drink.    I can't emphasize this point enough... this is not the type of "bar" I'm used to seeing.  It's an old retrofitted house.   The "bar" is what used to be the kitchen.  Your table (or standing area if you go when it's busy) is in what used to be the living room (or "fronchroom", if you're a fellow chicagoan).  I liked the design on the inside.  Hardwood floors, exposed beams, art on the walls, very low light.  *very* low light.  I had to hold the beer menu a few inches from my face before I could decide what to order.  However, a bar shouldn't be bright.  Throw on some good tunes on Sirius Underground Garage and you've got yourself a mood.  On to the beer:  Huge list of microbrews, many from the area and a ton from Oregon.  I went with the Monk Madness Rogue in a 22oz bottle.  7.4% apv of tastiness.  I liked the hoppy bite at the end.  My fellow drinker did not.  That's the great thing about this place, though.  There are so many different beers to explore.    Let's review: -Intimate place -Conducive to good conversation -Great beer list (also have a good wine list, including sake) -No $30k millionaires  4.5 stars rounded up.

This place is awesome.    The gelato is really good and comes in a ton of different varieties (though, never having had gelato in Italy, it probably tastes completely different) and it's reasonably priced ($3-4ish).       Also, this place makes some pretty good coffee, too.  I would definitely stop by just for the espresso.

Overrated and overpriced.  The rooms in the old section of the hotel are bad.    The only worthwhile parts of CP are the gaming floor (great sports book) and the food (MeSa is great), but you can do that- and shop in The Forum- without overpaying to stay here.

Is it trite to give this place 5 stars?     Should I be contrarian and say this place sucks?  I... can't.   I just can't.  This place is hands-down the best breakfast place in the valley, and short of getting a $30 breakfast at a swanky resort, it isn't even close.     I'll start by saying that when you order coffee, they bring you REAL CREAM for it.   Do you know how long it's been since I've seen a breakfast place bring me real cream?  So long that I had to check to make sure it wasn't spoiled half & half.  It makes their already good coffee taste awesome.    Next, they have actual thick cut bacon, not the pre-packaged strips you'll find at Denny's..  I'm drooling just thinking about it.    Everything I've had off their griddle (french toast, belgian waffles, crepes) have been awesome.  If you get the chance and you're hankering something sweet, get their taffy apple french toast.  I think they put me in a sugar coma, but it's soooo good.  Tons of apples, caramel, pecans, other things I don't really remember cause I kinda blacked out.  Oddly enough, though I haven't had them myself, I've heard the pancakes were less than spectacular- crumbly and overdone was the description a friend gave  Strange for what would seem to be their signature dish.  I'll chalk it up to a one-time error.    Also, can anyone explain why I find the need to order eggs for breakfast?  For some reason, it just doesn't feel like a breakfast meal unless there are eggs present, but I only ever eat like half of them.   I don't even really like them.  That's not really related to the review, just kinda throwing it out there.

I don't know how many leather-bound books he has or whether or not his apartment smells of rich mahogany, but head baker Jeff Yankellow is kind of a big deal.  In 2005, he was part of a team that won the Coupe du Monde, so he's literally been a world champion at baking.   You'd think with that kind of cache, you'd find him working at some ridiculously upscale restaurant or in an overly pretentious bakery in the middle of an overly pretentious area.  Nope.  The Simply Bread bakery is a non-descript warehouse with a small house in front to serve as the shop located on 24th St north of McDowell.     But, trust me, if this is out of the way for you, make the trip.  Jeff and his staff make some of the most ridiculously good baked things you will ever have.  The baguette is his specialty, but the bakery also served dozens of varieties of bread, jams, jellies, cookies, rolls, etc... Even just the standard white bread you'd make your PB& J on is awesome.  I overbought the last time I went in and spent the next 3 days finding things to do with bread, because I'd run out of freezer space.    I can't deduct a star for it being pricey.  You get what you pay for, and at this place you get the best possible ingredients prepared by those who are actually passionate about making bread.  This is one of the true hidden gems of Phoenix.

Ok, I'm a dude that likes meat and cheese, so, hey, sandwich with meat and cheese should be pretty awesome, right?  I love Chicago-style Italian Beef, and this is kinda similar components.    So why is the Italian Beef so delicious and the Philly Cheesesteak so repugnant?    Wiz.  Blech, blech, blech, blech.    Whoever invented Cheez Wiz needs to be punched right in the balls and made to refund the $10 it cost for this sandwich.

As a general rule, I'd almost rather stay sick that venture out to an urgent care center. However, when you're on day 4 of a sore throat/ fever that isn't going away, sometimes you have to bite the bullet.  So, I stumbled in, signed in & found a seat.  About an hour & a half of feeling like hell and having what seemed like a dozen kids buzzing around my head like gnats, I finally got in to have my vitals taken.  Once that was done, I got to wait another half hour for the doctor's visit, which lasted all of about 5 minutes.    The last step seemed simple- go back up front & the paperwork will be there shortly.  After 10 minutes of patiently (no pun intended) waiting, I finally ask someone at the front desk if they have my paperwork.  She looks around, and hands me the sheets that were sitting about one foot to her left.  Thanks!    All in all, the place is just really, really disorganized, and I wasn't up for 2 hours of waiting, even though I'm all nice & med-ed up.

I love BevMo.  HUGE selection of wines.  HUGE selection of beers.  HUGE selection of liquors & spirits.  Pretty much anything kind of accessory you could want for a cocktail-y party.  Reminds me a lot of Binny's back in Chicago.

I drive past  this place at least once every day, and assumed it was going to be just another sit down overly trendy Gainey restaurant.  What it actually is completely surprised me.  The best way I can describe it is the deli counter at AJs on steroids.    Just from what I saw they have salads, sandwiches, a hot carving station, an ice cream counter, a bakery, sushi, gourmet cheese, wine and pretty much any kind of side you could want from hummus to pasta salad.  Being in a rush, I opted for a ready made chicken ceasar .  Henri is right, it's not fast food-y type cheap ($9 for a meal-sized salad, and, i think, $6 without chicken), but it's also a lot better than you'd get from a drive-thru.  Along with the fresh greens and tasty dressing, you get nearly an entire chicken breast that actually tastes like someone tried to make it taste good, which is pretty unique for many take-away chicken ceasars.  While mainly a take-away establishment, they do have some limited seating.  So,  if you're like me and work in the Gainey area and are really looking to get away from fast food for lunch and a place where you can quickly grab a variety of different tasty things for lunch, this place is an awesome choice.  If you're looking for fine dining, you'll probably be disappointed.

5 stars for the idea, 3.5 for the follow through.  Cool little 3 oz burgers that you can customize with different meats, cheeses, toppings, etc...   I had a Kobe burger with bleu cheese, steak sauce & asparagus.  It was their daily special.  At first, I was a little, "what the hell?", but, being a laid-back dude, I decided to roll with it and give it a shot.  Pretty tasty!  Also, pretty pricey ($8, yikes.)  Since they're little and I was venturing out into odd burger territory, I figured I'd order a backup, old-traditional bacon cheese.  Unfortunately, it was just ok.  (This one was $4).  Other pro:  Sweet potato fries.  Hooray!  Random completion of thought:  I'd like to go back & try a buffalo burger at some point.

For those that haven't been to Sonic and aren't completely averse to fast food, what are you waiting for?  This chain has some of the tastiest, most artery-cloggingly good stuff.    They immediately get 2 stars just for having tater tots.  Everyone knows tots are potatoes in their finest form, it's just a scientific fact that cannot be questioned.  The official list is provided below:  1.  Tater Tots 2.  Hash Browns 3.  Au Gratin 4.  Twice-baked (because 2 is better than 1). 5.  Baked  They get another 2 stars for having one of the tastiest beverage concoctions known to man, the cherry limeade.  Again, if you haven't tried it, I kinda feel bad for you.    However, I can't give them the full 5 stars.  While their peripherals are damn good, their actual main staples are kinda meh.  Also, at this particular location, there always seems to be a long, slow-moving drive-thru line.  They're probably just understaffed, but it does get annoying.

This place really just isn't my cup of tea.  I'm not especially Scottsdalian, and this place is about the Scottsdaliest Scottsdale that ever Scottsdaled.  Looking around, I can't help thinking, "I don't think I'm tan enough to be in this place."  On the plus side, we had very good service and they have quite an extensive liquor list, from well all the way up to top shelf and everything in between.    However, you'd think a place with a 10 page liquor menu would have more than a dozen or so beers (however, to their credit, they did have Samuel Smith oatmeal stout... so good).   Also, if you're coming here, you better flash the cash.  This place certainly isn't cheap.  Also, for being in the heart of a bustling community, right on the canal (hence the name), it's pretty well hidden.  I guess hiding it helps to pump up the exlusivity.

The perfect grocery store for the quick trip, Fresh & Easy is just that.   It's loaded with fresh meat, fish, cheese, produce and even flowers and super convenient to get in & out of.  The thing I like best about this store is the intelligent design of it (the architectural nerd in me).  The take away meals, fish, meats, produce & milk are all towards the front of the store.  It's designed with the convenience of the consumer, not the profit of the store, in mind.  Knowing that the majority of their shoppers will be quick in, quick out people, they have more self-check stations than cashiers.  Just awesome.  The place is pretty spartan on the inside that kinda gives the impression of a mini sam's club type place.  It's not brightly colored of fancily decorated.  No giant picures of freshly watered apples that look nothing like the produce on the shelf.  No gimmicky displays.  Good.    Another thing I love is that the food is even set up for the on-the-go person.  Being someone that lives alone and usually just cooks for myself, I hate having to buy big packages of chicken or beef when I'm going to cook just one.  They have individually packaged steaks!  How awesome is that?!     It's also very organic-y friendly.  Everywhere I looked I saw organic this & organic that.  They even have 3 kinds of tofu.  3 kinds!   I didn't know tofu had kinds.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's not especially convenient for me.  It's a good 10 minutes away, but in checking out their website, it appears one will be moving 2 miles down the road from me.  I can't wait.

So I told the swamp donkey to sock it before I give her a trunky in the tradesman's entrance and have her lick me yarballs!  Sorry, I guess the Englishness seeped in.  I dug this place.  Yet another Phoenix house turned bar (the whole concept is still novel to me, so I'm like a little kid with a toy anytime I find a new one).   This one is most definitely English-themed.    On the taps, they've got Tetley's and on the menu they've got shephard's pie.  What more could you want?  Darts?  Oh yeah, they've got that, too.  Pool?  Done.  A wide array of other British Isle beers on tap and a nice selection of microbrew bottles?  Yep.   The fish n chips were in log form.  Not great, but pretty good.

So I've been searching for a good pub to take in a few English soccer matches and grab some grub, to replace the fantastic Ginger's in Chicago.    This place is pretty close.    With the "Quintessentially British", it has to be pretty good, no?  So, after checking their sports schedule online, I found they were going to show my team (Arsenal, for anyone interested) on a late Saturday afternoon.  I also saw that not only do they show English soccer, but  a ton of rugby, scottish & italian soccer.  Not bad!  The food is pretty decently British.  I've had the Shepherd's Pie (err, "Cottage" Pie) and the English breakfast (thankfully served minus puddings, which saved me the hassle of having to exclude it),  Both were passable for my palate.  Not being a native Brit, I can't really say it's "authentic", but it's probably as close as you'll find in Phoenix.  The beer list is halfway decent.  Boddingtons, Tetley's, Sam Smith, Bass, Blackthorn Cider & Newcastle were all available from what I saw.  I, of course, went with Guinness (what goes better with breakfast than a pint of the black?).  About a dozen whiskeys are also available, if the dirty water is more your speed.

Ok, mole, enough is enough.  Your time has come.  I went here on a recommendation of a friend who had a similar conversation with an unwanted hanger-on (not literally), and have nothing but good things to say about them.  In the first visit, they check you over to see what needs to be done.  That took a whole 10 minutes, then they reschedule you for a follow-up if you need treatment.    The actual D-day for my mole also only took about 10 minutes.  In the door, straight back to the doc's office, 5 minutes later it's a little local anesthetic and see ya, little buddy.  No putzing around the waiting room for an hour.  No waiting for 45 minutes while your doc takes care of a dozen other people.  Easy in, easy out.

Warning:  I'm not a sushi guy, so this review is based only on food of the cooked variety, though, from what I heard from everyone else in the group who was enjoying the more raw variety, the sushi and sashimi comes in a wide selection and plentiful quantity.  I started off with a Kirin, which is a good way to kick off any Japanese-ish meal, in my opinion.  I ordered the Beef Teriyaki, which comes with a very tasty miso, a bowl of rice and a rather mediocre salad.  The teriyaki was very well prepared, the meat cooked just right and the sauce tasty without being overpowering.     Also, the prices here are pretty reasonable.  I think the meal was in the $13 neighborhood and the 22oz. beer was $7.  Along with the huge list of sushi choices, they also had a nice selection of cooked seafood, as well. So, there's a little something for everyone.  I'm proof of that.

A nice little find tucked away in the overly pretentious Borgata shops, Sugarbakers is a new entry (only opened last month, I believe) into the competitive lunch market.    However, like Transformers, it's more than meets the eye.  In addition to traditional lunch fare (sandwiches & salads), they also serve breakfast and have a full working bakery that churns out cookies, brownies, pies & made to order cakes.  At first I kinda thought this place was typically, Scottsdalianly overpriced.  However, look who they're competing against for your lunch dollar.  For $9 at Sugarbakers, you get a half-sandwich with REAL carved turkey they roasted that day, a bowl of homemade soup, a mound of kettle chips, a homemade mini-muffin, a couple pieces of carrot, a slice of pickle and an olive.  (I was a little like, "uhhhhh, why do I have an olive?" at first).  Compare that to $6 for Subway or $8 for something like Paradise Bakery.  The freshness and quality here are so far superior that you'd be a dumbass not to pick Sugarbakers.  Also, I had a bit of an "OHMYGOD" moment.  I'm not sure if it's because I'd pretty much cut sweets out of my diet for the last month or so or what, but their chocolate chip cookie is effing ridiculously good.   They also had something called a "Cowboy Cookie" that had pecans & rice krispies in it.   It was novel, but not holycrapworthy like the chocolate chip.    Most of their lunch items are in the $7-11 range.  Next time I go, I have my eye on the "Sedona Special Salad", which has greens, turkey, cranberries & pecans.with a citrus vinaigrette or the "Sugarbakers Chopped Salad" that has greens, avocado, blueberries & walnuts.    Their breakfast stuff seems pretty fairly priced- Stack of pancakes for $5, Apple Praline or Bananas Foster French Toast (whoa, sounds good) for $8, Bacon & Eggs for $7.   I'll have to check it out and throw on a homemade cinnamon roll just for good measure.  Also, like I mentioned, you can get cakes & pies to order.  When I was there, one lady was picking up 30 cakes for an event.    Sugarbakers also makes mention that they use organic & natural foods whenever possible.  The quality shows.

I've died and gone to alkie heaven.  I walked in & got giddy like an 8 year old at a Hannah Montana concert.  It's basically a grocery store for wine, beer & booze.  Unlike BevMo, my local fav, which is a couple aisles of wine & a decent beer selection, this is aisle after aisle after aisle of fermented grapey goodness (I think their selection of just French wines is bigger than all of BevMo's cumulative wine stock).    I found some great Spanish Riojas, a Greek Roditis, some great South American Malbecs, and a few more run-of-the-mill, yet still excellent, Zins & Shirazes (Shirii?  Shirazus?).   Their staff is knowledgeable and ever-present, so, just in case you miss their staff picks, you can track down someone to give you a pointer.    I think I ended up with 8 quality bottles for something like $90.    Their beer selection, sadly, isn't as huge as their wine selection, but it still includes all the favs for less than normal prices (Rogue Dead Guy was something like $7.50 for a 6 pack).    I was gonna check out the booze selection, but figured I'd save it for another trip before I passed out.

Yay, more strip mall fun finds!  Welcome to the far west valley.  First "Bella Luna", now "Tastings."    I have to admit, this rating is based on the fact that there really isn't anything like this in this area, and, therefore, it gets rounded up from 3.5.    When we went there, there were seriously like 5 other people in this place on a Friday night.  Hmm...   Anyway, $8-12 for some tasty flights, most glasses about in that range.  Also, some pretty tasty appitizers.  I had some boar and venison sausage.  Odd, but pretty awesome.

I think they've worked the kinks out, at least it seemed that way when I went.    I had an excellent petit filet accompanied by a piece of short rib you could cut with a fork.  My date had the ahi and said it was fantastic.  The service was excellent in a barely visible way.  I was a little hesitant from the horror stories posted here, but I'm glad I checked it out for myself.  It's on the short list of my favorite fine dining places in the valley, now.

Would have never found this place without direction from a co-worker.  McDonald & Granite Reef isn't an area I often frequent.    Pros:   -Staff was friendly and helpful and offered suggestions.   -Sandwich was pretty huge and stacked with the thick cut sliced sirloin. -The spicy BBQ sauce was awesome.  I'd bathe in it if I could.  Enough heat to clear the sinuses a bit, but not obnoxiously so. -They cater  Cons: -A bit on the pricey end.  $5-7 for sandwiches, then you add sides & drinks. -Something a bit off about the mac & cheese.  Had a flavor I couldn't quite place.  I'd definitely go back here for lunch.

Dear Chick-fil-A,  Your waffle fries are delicious, as are your chicken sandwiches.    Love,   Sean  p.s.  I'm scared to try your breakfast menu, because it just looks like a tiny chicken sandwich on a biscuit, which sounds pretty effing weird to me.  Actually, it sounds delicious.  I've changed my mind, Chick-fil-A, I will have one of your odd breakfast things as soon as I get the chance.

The people at the store itself were actually fairly helpful and the furniture is of decent quality.  Why only two stars, you ask?  Because I thought their delivery was horrible.    When I bought the furniture, I set up the delivery date for the day I was to move into my new condo and told them I'd prefer an afternoon delivery so that I can make sure I've got everything settled.   The day before delivery, they call and say I'm the first delivery of the day on the 830-1230 truck (which usually, I would be very stoked about), which wouldn't work, because I wouldn't have the keys until 10 at the earliest.  I told them this and they said it shouldn't be a problem to switch it to around noon.     The next morning, they call at 815 to say they are 20 minutes away.  "Uh, yeah, I told the lady last night that I wouldn't have keys until 10, and she said she'd set me up for around noon", I said.  "Oh, that won't work", says the driver guy, then procedes to tell me if I'm not there, that he can just put the furniture outside.  After explaining, in no uncertain terms, that he wouldn't be doing that, he said he'd make us the last run and would call when he was on his way.    Here is how the rest of the day played out: Around 12:  I ran to do errands, and completely lost track of time and everything else (which is pretty typical of me). 330: Return home and realized that I still didn't have furniture (I'm quite astute).  I call the store, they say they'll call the driver and get right back to me.   400:  No furniture and no return call.  I call them back, they say the driver will be there in about 20 minutes.   500:  Twenty minutes has now lasted an hour.  I call back again to see what the hell is going on, they say the driver is now stuck in traffic.  When I ask for an ETA, they say, "about 45 minutes."  It's at this point that I start losing it (and I'm generally a very calm person).  It seems, I was not aware of the normal person to delivery person time conversion rate.  Simple misunderstanding.   600:  Still no driver.  I call AGAIN, they say the driver will be there in 5 minutes. 630:  The driver finally shows up.   I would really, really, really love to know how twenty minutes became two and a half hours.  I still have no answers.  I did, however, have a broken dresser.   Yep, not only was it over 6 hours late, some of it was broken.    Follow up:  I called the next day to let them know the dresser was broken.  They promptly brought me a new one within 48 hours and were actually right on time on that occasion.

I must have a sign on my back that says, "Please make my purchase with your company as large of a cluster-f*** as possible."  I thought The Room Store had horrible service, but DirecTv takes the gigantic crap-filled cake.    Having just purchased a new condo in Tempe, I kind of would like to have things set up relatively quickly.  So, the week before I'm set to move in, I go online and set up a package deal for internet/phone/tv through Qwest (who uses DirecTv for the TV end of the deal).   Qwest sets up an installation date for the second day after I move in.  I'm thinking, "great, that was really quick."  One problem:  Qwest only set up the phone and internet.  At no point did they tell me beforehand that I needed to set up a seperate install time with DirecTv.  Since I made a one-stop purchase, I assumed a one-stop installation.     I was wrong.   Very wrong.    On September 30, I called to set an installation time with DirecTv.  Having just purchased an HDTV, I requested an HD tuner (duh).  They said the earliest possible install date would be October 25 for even basic, normal, no HD equipment.  I grudgingly accepted that date.  What else could I do?  Fast forward to October 24.  I'm excited to finally get TV in my condo.  However, I have yet to receive any kind of call to set up a time for tomorrow's install.  I decide to call DirecTv and see what was up.  Guess what?  Not only was I never put on the schedule for a delivery date and time, but even if I was, they have a backorder on the tuners for an unspecified amount of time.  I asked the supervisor what day I could expect to actually get installed, he said, "I don't know."  That's a pretty effing bad answer if you ask me.  Furthermore, while they were willing to do a basic install (about a week from now) and then bring the HD tuner when it came into stock, they said I would be charged twice for installation, and when the tuner actually did arrive, I would have to cancel service and then reactivate service with all sorts of fun fees they were unwilling to waive.    The bottom line is, it will likely be two months between the time I ordered my service and the time it actually gets installed.    "Somebody up there loves you", but it sure as hell isn't me.  UPDATE:  I finally got installed, and guess what?  It looks like total crap.  Their "custom" install involved propping the satelite dish on my balcony and advising I "go buy concrete blocks to keep it from blowing over" and then running cables through my window and my sliding door and across my carpet.  Sweet!     They keep getting worse.
