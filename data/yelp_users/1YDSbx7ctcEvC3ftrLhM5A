We had trouble finding this place and had to call them twice for directions as the hostess/phone answerer did not know where they were located apparently. The food was really undercooked and slow to get. The waiter was super nice and we did not have to pay for the few bites we did consume. My friend got the monkey cakes, which were undercooked.  I got "the hatch" which said it was chicken breast, but appeared to be chicken breast lunch meat. We won't be rushing back.

Not bad,  but not amazing either.  The Eggs Benedict Florentine had nicely blanched fresh spinach,  but something about the houlindese sauce is off.  Maybe the lemon or the lack of zing in the flavor.

Another trendy spot with not so hot food.  We had the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Pancetta Pasta with sweet peas both were really bland.  The rice ball appetizer with two dipping sauces was delightful however.    This may be better spot for drinks and appetizers.

Very flavorful black tea and the Kale and Quinoa Salad was a different combination for a salad and very tasty.  Friendly cheery staff, good music and atmosphere.
