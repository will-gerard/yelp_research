I use to love this place but in the last six months this place has gone to hell.  Their portions have almost been cut in half and their prices have gone up and the service has gone down. The last few times I have gone in there the only person that takes the orders is some girl named Phing who barely speaks english gets the orders wrong and then acts like it is your fault. The need to move Josh back up to the front. He always greeted everyone with a warm smile and always remembered people.  They changed their menu a few months back and I think that is when it started going down hill.   I went in there today about 12:30 ordered my meal after waiting 15 min for the food I went to get sauces and was informed they where all out of soy sauce and hot sauce. This store is owned by the same people that own the other Ono's in the valley they could have got some from another store before they opened or even gone to the Fry's in the same parking lot and got some. How can you open a Hawaiian BBQ place with out those. What really got me mad was the fact that they got mad at me for asking them for it. When I asked them to package it to go so I could take it home and get soy sauce the girl at the counter tells me "Fine then take it home"  I will not be back here for a very long time.

I love coming here to get a sandwich after my workout but I'm going to have to start going to subway. Paulette and Justin in the deli are the rudest most unfriendly people I've had to deal with. And managers don't seem to care

OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I went to this place today because my wife told me how good they where at the chocolate festival. I was thinking ok cipcakes whatever. I ended up getting three cupcakes Oreo Chocolate gunash Carmel Frappachino. All where great but the carmel frappachino was completly of the hook. I could make myself sick eating these. I may be in trouble now that I know where they are. My wife may end up getting a restraining order. LOL  On top of having great cupcakes the staff was extremely friendly. If you live any where in the west valley you need to check this place out.

This place is wonderful and the staff was extremely friendly. The food was amazing and the prices were about the same as any other Italian place. For those of you saying the service is slow maybe you should slow down. We enjoyed the fact we were able to go in and not feel like we were bring rushed out the door so they could put the next set of butts at our table. We choose to share a meal and the waitress and kitchen put the meal on separate plates to serve us. Maybe slow but good service.
