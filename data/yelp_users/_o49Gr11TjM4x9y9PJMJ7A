Never again. I feel like I need a pedicure after the crap they gave me. Super pushy, not kind at all. Ugh.

I have given this place MULTIPLE chances... and EVERY time I am disappointed. If Mikey is working, it's worth it. I planned on having a mani/pedi on wednesday so I called and made an appointment. I showed up before my appointment but sat in the pedi chair for more than 20 min before a tech came over... I ended up pulling my feet out of the water while I waited. I ended up not getting a mani because I didn't want to be there until 8pm. The "manager" apologized... but I've heard it plenty of times before!!!! I won't be going back....

Absolutely no customer service... Everyone there is miserable with the exception of 2 bellman who drove us to and from our destinations. I requested a fridge before we got there; wasn't in the room when we got there so I called the frog desk and was told, "i will send it right up"... An hour later, no fridge. Called again and told them we were leaving for dinner so they could come in the room while we were gone...2 hours later? No fridge. Seriously?? The bed was hard, we were only "allowed" 2 pool towels while we were there, the shower head sucked, and the AC BARELY worked which the front desk didn't care about either. Thank goodness we didn't pay full price! Oh and although the breakfast buffet was delish, our "waiter" was an ass. The busboy was more helpful. Never again!

Yummy! First time ever at Corbin's tonight...  What a great experience! Our waitress, Vicki, was fabulous! You can tell she loves her job... We never felt smothered or ignored.  Bacon man n cheese, carolina burger, fries are amazing!!!, chowder and wings... ALL delicious! Only con is the prices... A bit steep for us to make it a regular place.

The only pro was that this is way better than studio movie grill but nowhere close to ipic. I'm so glad we had a gift card because I would've been pissed if we were spending our own money.  Cons: 1. The seat I was in had tears which made it totally uncomfortable in my shorts.  2. They were out of the espresso mix 3. It took 30 minutes to get an iced tea, water and popcorn 4. The servers are not very well versed in customer service  Only way I'm going back is if we have a gift card again.

I don't really even know how to rate this one... I guess one should not expect great service when not paying. (This isn't the only place I've experienced this...) I won 4 free B12 injections at a health fair. Obviously they knew that someone would win as they chose to donate the certificate for the health fair, right? So, I called around the 3rd of September to make an appointment and I wasn't able to get an appointment until today, the 14th. I wasn't really in a hurry but surprised that I had to wait so long. So, I come in before my appointment (thought I would have to fill out some medical history) and there I stood while 4 ladies had their own conversations. Finally, one greeted me but didn't know what to do and another had pulled my info up. OK, so I talked to her. She asked me if I was there to pick them up and I let her know that I had an appointment. The NP that I was supposed to have an appointment with was out with food poisoning. So, one would assume that either they would have called to change my appointment or someone would be covering her patients. NOPE! After some confusion, on her part, she walked to the back and came back with a bag;handed it to me and said "have a nice day"... ummmm, ok? No instructions, no inquiry as to my health/allergies/comfort level with stabbing myself. Luckily, I have given myself injections before so I was ok with the needle part of it all. This was THE STRANGEST experience of my life!

Great family owned business... I have zero complaints! My fiance and I ordered invitations for our wedding from them. We recently had our save the dates sent out... AMAZING! EXACTLY what we wanted! I'm not a very creative person but Joanie took my random ideas and created beautiful invitations. She worked directly with our photographer to get the picture we wanted for our save the date maganets. I can't say enough great things...  I would like to point out to "Ashley S." that there are dozens of people who come in contact with mail and packages once it leaves their offices. It's not their  fault... I've never had an issue and they have MANY regulars from the neighborhood and local businesses.

I was VERY disappointed.... I LOVE H&M and have never had a bad experience (as I had to travel to get to one). Never in my H&M shopping have I experienced such S*&%TY customer service!!! No one acknowledged anyone and when my roommate asked where she could find a certain item she was told to "look around and find it yourself"! wtf? I get that it was opening day... but COME ON! Although that annoys me... the clothes are AWESOME! I only bought 2 items but received a 20% off coupon that's good until the 25th... I'll be back for sure... hopefully I'll run into friendlier staff! Oh, and the music was WAY too loud... love the music but I may have lost my hearing a bit...

A month ago I wouldn't have had a complaint about this location but after tonight, we won't be going back. It seemed as if the entire staff was new except the guy behind the grill annoyingly yelling out that the veggies/rice/steak was ready. They were way understaffed and poorly managed, come to junk of it no one seemed to be in charge at all. One would think with all the closures of chipotle in other states that they would be doing everything to keep their customers. To top it all off the food was horrible, the rice was undercooked and something had too much water in it as I was left with a puddle in my dish. Yuck.

No reason to not give this place 5 stars! Bought the hair cut groupon and called to make an appointment. Took me a while to get on their schedule but my life is busy! Took me a few minutes to find their cozy cove in the (pretentious) Sacchi Salon. But everyone I met at Green was more than friendly and not one bit fake! A nice change to see in a Scottsdale salon. Juan cut my hair. He was so great! I'm not much of a talker... And I never felt like he was too probing or disinterested. I will be going back for sure!

Hard to believe I'm rating a moving company so high! I have had ok and HORRIBLE experiences with 2 men and a truck so I was nervous about hiring another moving company. Garrett was friendly and able to schedule us with about a week and a half notice. It was a little more than I wanted to pay (only because my last movers took FOREVER) but in the end it was cheaper than I thought! TJ arrived with 2 other guys and got to work! My husband said they were quick and efficient. When I met up with them at the new house they were smiling and communicating with each other and had finished the job in 3.5 hours! What?!? Seriously, don't hesitate! Hire these guys!! We've already told our friends about them!!

Delish! We were looking for a treat after the Dbacks game... Picked the right spot! The girls are sweet and patient with my indecisive husband. I had the Vietnamese Coffee with a peanut butter cookie on the bottom (bomb choice) and he had the mint cookie which he says was "good". Reasonably priced...just wish there were more places to sit!

This place was recommended to us... Beer only. But it was pricey, warm and the happy hour didn't look much better so we didn't bother to come back. The guy who greeted us at the door was overly eager and excited to see new/more people. The bartender was lackluster and didn't know how to make an eclipse and it wasn't great even when I told her how to make it. This is a one time only visit.

I've visited this location as well as the north scottsdale one. My husband and I walked in and asked for a table for 7 and the "hostess" was rude, rolled her eyes and responded "wait here. I guess I have to put tables together for you". So sorry to be bringing business to your employer! Had a wonderful and patient waitress, sampled many beers as a table and I settled on the Orange Blossom. YUM! For dinner I had the carne asada tacos, amazing!! Others had the burger and cheese, az burger, salmon blt and surf n turf...no complaints except one of the burgers was pink when they asked for no pink. Oh, the fries are delicious! Only other con... The bathroom is disgusting!!! Yuck!

I must admit first that my husband and I are not church people. We both grew up going to church (him a catholic and me a Lutheran/nondenominational Christian) but as we became adults we chose not to go. I visited a couple of churches in the Phoenix area in my late teens and early 20's but never found a place where I felt at home like I do when I visit my family's church in Southern California where I grew up. After adding a baby to our life, we have been having separate and mutual difficulties in our relationship with each other and with others. So I put it out to the Facebook community to locate a church. I got a variety of answers and looked them up online but resonated with CCV as it reminded me of my church in California. We attended this Saturday and felt welcomed from the start. We dropped out 10 month old off in the infant room with Hope who was just so sweet. Her husband Anderson showed us around, talked a little about the church, his family and introduced us to the site pastor who was also so kind. I did not feel one ounce of fake from anyone (I'm a teacher...I know how to read people and their attitudes). The music was great (even though I always feel that Christian music is so wordy...), the musicians were VERY talented and the message from the Pastor resonated greatly in our relationship. Our daughter was visibly content with the volunteers in the nursery and they said she did great! We are excited to return next week!

I have been visiting various The Joint locations for a couple years now... This location opened up so close to my house and Dr. Roach has been treating for me for about a year now. I am a teacher and constantly have stress and tight shoulders as well as an old back injury that flares up now and then. Every time I leave a session I feel like a new woman! When I found out I was pregnant, I was a little nervous about continuing getting adjustments as my OB isn't keen on it. I was so miserable... I called and was reassured that the Dr could adjust me still. I met with him around 16 weeks and he told me that he adjusted his wife during pregnancy and his kiddos. Talk about relieved! I am 29 weeks now and have seen him 5 times so far... And I won't stop!!

SO YUMMY! I have been to a similar place in California so I was excited to drive past this place yesterday and even more excited that my hubby wanted to try it for dinner! It's a great concept for a great price. The staff seemed tired and there definitely weren't enough people there to cover the needs of the customers. We got 2 pizzas, a drink and a beer for under $30. Oh, they have Papago Orange Blossom on tap which is the best beer ever! Their ice teas were super delish but my favorite was the Caramelized Pear... I could drink a gallon of that! And to top it off they have the best ice too! Overall a good experience and we would go back but do a few things differently. I would ask for mine to be cooked longer, the crust was a little soggy and my hubby would not spring for the mega pizza as it was a let down but he would have been happy with just the mod style.

My husband visited earlier in the week for lunch so we stopped by on a Saturday evening. It was DEAD at almost 6:00. My husband double checked to make sure they were open. The 2 girls working were sweet and got our food done quickly. The food was delicious and I would definitely get the Cobb wrap again!! 2 complaints: the high chairs were VERY dirty (you would think the place would be spotless since they had no customers before us) and it is WAY overpriced. $30-something dollars for a wrap, salad and 2 drinks is steep! Yes I know it's organic and what not but it's still pricey. We would go back for sure regardless.

Love this concept but the service and quality is inconsistent.   I love that we can custom create our pizza but sometimes the crust is not so awesome. I was told to ask for it cooked longer but it has come out burnt too.   There are quite a few "copies" of this chain so I'll keep coming back unless I find something consistently better.   Oh, the carmelized pear ice tea is SOOOO good, best ice ever and they serve Papago orange blossom. Can't go wrong there.
