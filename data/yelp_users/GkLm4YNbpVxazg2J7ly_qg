From my Army days, party days, till today Waffle House will hold a place in my heart.  The price and 24/7 breakfast will always keep ppl coming. The small tight knit restaurants, "salespersons", ppl yelling Mark, will have them coming back. I have seen rich people and poor alike come together in this place and I always feel comfortable.

Dear god this Ribeye is amazing. Cooked to tenp. and 13.00. So delicious.  The bar itself is a total dive with dart leagues and beer. But somehow they have some great food and a ridiculious price.  But yeah come to grub out.

Funny thing. I don't normally frequent small shops. Maybe I should. But with Sports Authority closing I gave it a shot. My friends kids swim on teams so I asked her where she buys the pro stuff. She recommended this place and they hd everything. All professional gear at solid deals. I recommend them for swimming. They do other sports too though.

I was on a date in Apache Junction. My buddy said come here since there is only a few good places in Aj. Cool bartenders, cheap beer and good food. The karaoke on wed was awesome lol. But yeah, next time I rub though AJ I will most likely stop through here because it was not that bad of a place.

The tamales are like I remember  in Texas. It's funny, for Arizona being so hispanic heavy - the mexican food kinda falls short. But these tamales came through!!

Food and service are a joke! There is a reason their food is in the freezer isle. In fact the food they serve may have come from  Wal-Mart.

The food and service were cafeteria quality - the prices were high end. The vegetables were soaking wet from the steamer bag in the microwave. The Homemade chowder was clearly ordered from Sysco.  The 11.99 I paid for pasta turned out to be a lil cup of pasta in a wide shallow dish to make it seem like something. The server was ridiculous and ran from me after saying "you ready?" This place is a joke. Stay away!!!

I heart Bosa. Best in valley! Only reason they get 4 stars and not 5 is the coffee situation. As great as the doughnuts are the coffee is wack-tastic.

Man, I have been driving past this place everyday for years. From the outside it looks like some kind of dive. But it is not.        Finally brought in by the price, I was happy to see a newly renovated interior of a classic diner and a warm welcoming staff.        I ordered the chile cheese Fry's and the double cheese burger and they brought the  food to me. It was amazing and for the cost - outstanding!

Dr. Wold and his crew are amazing! The selection of eyeglasses not only worked with my insurance but were Gucci to boot. Competent employees make this place the best. Nothing worse than a good doctor with crappy front desk girls!

I sent a picture to my friend in India and he said the food looked normal but I was eating with a fork instead of bread - so I was wrong. There are reviews that say the food is not spicy as it should be and I would agree but that does not make the food bad. The food is amazing. The price is set to match and they have attentive great service. I eat hear alot and will continue to eat here.

I got food poisoning - twice! Yes I said twice!  The 2nd time they where super cheap with portions too and filled in the box with white rice on the bottom to make it look full!        The first time I had food from here I was actually impressed. The food was tasty and still relatively warm after the 45 min wait. But then I got the S**!. I didnt put my finger on Yummy Yummy right away  but thought it was suspect.       About 6 days later I wanted to give it another shot. This is when they gypt me out of the food as stated above. However, the same night and next day - I got the sh^*! Again! My guts hurt as I am writing this since I am on day two of not holding down food. F*!# This Place!

Thunderbird is a bar/restaurant that not only had hot tasty food at a great price but a more outback bar setting.       The other reviews make Thunderbird come off as more of a biker bar, but the reality is that Tunderbird Roadhouse is a quality restaurant e.g. Four Peaks, Chilies, or Texas Roadhouse. However, this reality is over looked by the "know one 21 and younger after 10" when Thunderbird becomes a full on bar.      It is what it is. If I wanted to eat lunch service again I would call it in so I could eat great food and enjoy the rest of my lunch break. Furthermore, if I wanted to goto a cool bar I would go after 10pm to enjoy the decor and hear live music. I will go back for dinner.

Lunch specials are on point. Lots of food for 5 bucks. Comes out hot and fast. I have only been here for lunch so not much more information. But if you call it in, your are good to go. They are the best example of Chinese fast food.

A bowl and a beer - 11.51. For my lunch hour I enjoy good fast food and Chipotle always delivers. The one thing that has always stood out about Chipotle is the fact that they have moist brown rice. This is a big deal because as I am trying to be heath conscious its a hard thing to achieve.  Always in the mood for Chipotle.

Winco is a chain from the north that opened in AZ. After looking in the whole store I conclude that its just another Wal-Mart except at Wal-Mart they BAG YOUR Groceries!       Yes, you heard me right. You bag your own groceries. Thank gwad I didnt do heavy shopping.       Same prices, Less selection, Bag your own groceries, and meat department smelled like fish. Wont come back.

The meat and cheese has me coming back. I am a serious lover of sandwiches. One thing you can do right and other places are doing is having fresh bread and veggies. However, the amount and quality of the meat and cheese is a good indicator to me of the commitment to quality. Why? Because the cost.       Cousins seriously stacks on the meat - and the meat in not thin or watery. The cheese is amazing and full of flavor. Its a great place. Yes, the cost is higher because of it but when I pay 10.00 for a sandwich I don't want a skinny Jimmy Johns bite sandwich.       Now with all that said 4 stars. This location in particular has a crew that needs some management. Some of the guys are good but the few bad apples hit hard.

After reading about this place in The Wall Street Journal I had to stop by. Based on "Authentic Napoletana" pizza, it was a target on my list. With that being said, I have never been to Italy.       But the food was really amazing for the price. I Spent 35 bucks and had an 3 course meal of high quality tasty food.         However, I am a stickler for service. Even though I did not see anyone wait very long to get seated (self included), It took 5 minutes to get acknowledged for a drink - and I sat at the bar. Followed by me flagging servers down to take my order plus asking the owners wife for a utensils and my napkin.        Bless the owner and his wife. He is busting his butt cooking for quality and trying to keeps things moving and his wife was very nice and tried to do the same.        Rare is it that I would consider going somewhere again with bad service. But - I under stood the issue, not the food, location, price, quality of restaurant - but staff. I will come again. lol.

Ppl were ranting about the "All natural" burgers - they are frozen patties. There was a long line of customers upset at the fact the food took forever. 20 min wait just for ice cream. The kicker of the whole experience was the 6 dollar burger that looks like it came from In and Out. Place is ridiculous. Wont last.

I have only had one bad drink here. The staff, atmosphere, and coffee makes this place the best. It also feel not as basic drinking coffee here since they are not everywhere hahah.

Exceptional quality and knowledge! The one thing that makes this place my personal favorite is their commitment to local glass and art. Watching glass blowers on 1st Friday to having any question and price  with!
