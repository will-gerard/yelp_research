First of all, if you think a bagel is a piece of bread with a hole in the middle, like grocery stores or chain bagel shops here in AZ sell, then you may not like this place. BUT, if you've ever had a bagel from NY or NJ and wonder why they are almost non-existent anywhere else, this is the place for you. I grew up in Fair Lawn NJ, home of the best bagels on earth. I'm not sure if I would be able to tell the difference between a bagel from this place and one from back home if I was given the blindfold test. And the best thing about it? THEY HAVE TAYLOR HAM!!!! You can get a Taylor ham, egg and cheese on a bagel for breakfast!  PS Real bagels are supposed to give your jaws a workout.

I have been bringing my pets to Dr. Cohen for the best care possible for years, ever since he was located in Phoenix. I tried many vets before I found him, and several after he moved up to Anthem (since I lived so far away), and none of them even compare to him. After spending way too much money and  seeing my pets suffer at the hands of substandard veterinarians, I realized Dr. Cohen is well worth the trip and I will never take my pets to anyone else again. His facility has the latest technology and Dr. Cohen stays updated on all the new developments in the veterinary industry. He is great with my dogs, cats and ferrets (you won't find a better ferret vet). As an added bonus, their prices are very reasonable for the great care they provide.

I used to love going to the location on the I17 and Bell Road, especially when they had their Tuesday wing specials. My BF and I used to share an antipasto salad and get 2 dozen wings plus beer and leave feeling stuffed with money still left in our pockets. I no longer live in AZ but recently went back for a business trip and was craving my usual meal, so we went to this location. The salad was about half the size it used to be, but the wings were pretty much the same. The biggest difference was obvious when the bill came. It was $50 for 2 dozen wings, a salad and a couple of $3 beers! Whaaaaa? They charge almost a dollar per wing! I realize it wasn't Tuesday night when the wings are on special (.60/wing isn't exactly cheap either, though), but MY GOD! Last I checked wings are the junkiest part of the chicken...when did they turn into gold? Throw about 3 cents worth of sauce on it and charge almost $1? I don't think so. This place was so much better before locations started popping up all over the place and they changed the name. Now they think they are all corporate and fancy. Not so much, people. And the real kicker? We were both sick all night because of whatever they served us. Needless to say, my wing days are over until I find a place that doesn't try to rob me blind.

I have lived really close to this place for years but didn't try it until last week. I always thought it was like a pizza hut...limited menu of mediocre pizza and slimy wings but with beer. Turns out I was wrong...it's a really fun sports bar with a wide array of bar-type food and a great drink selection. They even have NTN trivia if you're into that. The day we were there, the Three Olives girls were walking around giving out free 'Dew" shots, which was a nice bonus. We had pizza and wings and while the pizza wasn't the most amazing pizza I've ever had, it was quite enjoyable. And the wings were really good too, nothing like Pizza Hut's. They had a ton of other things I'd like to try someday too...salads, countless appetizers, sandwiches, calzones....something for everyone.

For a Chinese buffet....this is as good as it gets. The place is huge and is always packed. If you don't want to wait in line then go on an off hour or day. People have mentioned that the floor is dirty...but that's because there are so many people here at any given time (families with kids that drop food, etc) that its hard to keep up. I was never skeeved by the lack of cleanliness. Yes they do have a pan of hundreds of baby octopus which is kind of repulsive to me, but coincidentally they are my boyfriend's favorite. I just try not to look at his plate. And yes, the egg rolls are horrible, but luckily you have about a gazillion other things to choose from. Chinese spareribs, chicken on a skewer, sweet and sour chicken, soups...I have these as appetizers and by the time I'm done I'm too full to eat much of anything else. But I have sampled the main course dishes and they were all very good. They also have a Mongolian grill so you can choose your ingredients and have them cook it up for you. There are also steaks and a sushi bar too...all included. I would be surprised if you can't find something you love here.

This is a great restaurant! There is something for everyone....spicy for the adventurous types and flavorful for the rest of us. They have a full bar too, and an assortment of beers from India. Our waiter was awesome...very friendly and kinda funny. Everyone was very attentive yet not to the point of being annoying. They have the buffet for lunch and also for dinner, so if you can't decide on what to get, do the buffet and sample a bunch of things. It was a very good experience and I would recommend this place highly to anyone. Finally something other than a chain! Give it a try!

These guys are awesome! They had to move me twice in one month which was a feat, considering my hoarding tendencies. They packed and moved it all quickly and with smiles on their faces. They are super friendly and professional, plus their prices are great. They didn't even complain about the plethora of dog and cat hair that starting whirling around the house once they moved my furniture. I would recommend them to anyone! In fact, I will be moving again in a few weeks (hopefully for the last time) and I would love for them to come out here to California and do it!

Got takeout from here several times and ate in the restaurant once. This is by far the best Chinese food in the area...Everything I've had is fresh and delicious. I usually go for the chicken and broccoli, and if you get it to go they'll give you enough food for 2 or 3 meals. I am still on a quest to find the perfect eggroll though...you know the big fluffy golden brown ones with pork and shrimp in them (I'm from NJ and that's what they're like there) and still no luck. But this place is a breath of fresh air considering the best Chinese food we had around here was Panda Express...and Chinese food shouldn't come from a fast food restaurant.
