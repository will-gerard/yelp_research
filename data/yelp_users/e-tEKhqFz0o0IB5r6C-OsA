Love Cibo, the simple presence of this restaurant in the neighborhood is really good for the revitalization of downtown.   The salsicce sandwich and house salad are amazing and the staff is great. totally recommend

I was really concerned when we drove up and couldn't smell any BBQ smells. That is always a bad omen.  Let's break down the good points, first. Very nice staff and clean restaurant. I would roll around naked in their cornbread and ask to be buried with the mac & cheese. The meat preparation of the ribs and the pulled pork was really nice. However. The sauce sucks. Both the regular and the spicy are thin and lack flavor. You can taste the ketchup in the sauce and little else. The onion brick was cold and greasy and the shoestring fries were limp and flavorless. This is the first time my husband has been to a bbq place and not basically licked his plate clean. He left over half of his brisket sandwich. Unheard of.  The meal was pricey and mediocre. This is far from the best bbq.

Cute, cute, cute. Seriously, did I mention cute? Great selection of quirky, locally made items and a friendly staff in this converted bungalow. Loved it. Will definitely be back

if there was a way to give this place no stars, I would. I walked in on a Friday afternoon to buy a birdcage veil and a cake topper. I realize, this is not going to be the largest sale for the store, however...I am not sure how any of them would know I wasn't going to be a big sale because no one ever spoke to me. Not a "hello" or "how can we help you?" or even a "we will be with you in a moment.". Nothing. I found my own veil, with no help and my own cake topper, with no help.   Then when I went to the front to pay for my items, I waited behind a bridal party who were ordering dresses. At no point did any of the other employees offer to take my money, nor did the employee behind the register even acknowledge that I had been standing, waiting to pay for almost 1/2 an hour.   I left the items at the empty counter after two employees walked right past me to the back room and left. In tears. Way to make my wedding shopping an awesome experience. Not.

That this place has more than one star on average leads me to believe that there are many, many, many people in Phoenix who were born without tastebuds.   Let's start with the positive- La Piccola is cute and clean. Both of those are important. So, well done. That earns you the one star that Yelp says I have to give you in order to leave a review. Because, trust, little Piccola, if I could have given you negative stars, I would.   My business partner and I came after work today to have a little strategy meeting and take advantage of the Living Social deal she purchased worth $30. She was told when she called that she had to make reservations and that the Living Social coupon couldn't be used for the happy hour prices on appetizers. Okay, fair enough. We headed on over after making our reservation.  Reservation? ARE YOU SERIOUS, PICCOLA? We were, save the staff, the only ones there. During "happy hour". This should have been our first clue. The very snarky server greeted us with "Oh, are YOU the ones that called with the coupon?". Awesome! Nothing like making us feel like losers because we had the nerve to purchase a deal that you offered.   After being seated and given water, our waitress disappeared. We waited for almost 20 minutes waiting for her to reappear. She didn't. My business partner went to track her down and she came back, five minutes later. She rolled her eyes, and with a sour face begrudgingly took our order. She was flat out rude and it set the tone for our whole experience. We ordered the cannelini bean bruschetta, hummus and baba gannhouj, and the ham and cheese appetizers. My business partner had a glass of wine and I had green tea.  The food here is miserable. MISERABLE! Like, I would rather eat my own eye than have another forkful of food from this place. The ham and cheese, which is billed as swiss cheese and some exotic ham from the special pigs of the region of blah blah blah,  tasted like canned ham and chopped up grocery store cheese. The honey mustard is straight out of the McDonald's drive though. The bruschetta was overly vinegary and the beans were weird in texture. Definitely from a can, as they had a tinny quality. The hummus was bland and absolutely drenched in olive oil. It was topped with three of the squishiest olives known to man. Speaking of, how DO you mess up an olive? The physics of this flummox me.  But, the worst of all....the baba gannhouj. We have both had this on several occasions in our lives and this? This was a hot mess. A weird, gross, salty mess. It had the textural integrity of snot. Again, drenched in olive oil. When we asked for something else, we were given an interrogation worthy of an international  crime and told that it is "an acquired taste". My palate isn't unsophisticated, I know what baba gannhouj is supposed  to taste like (even if I can't spell it). What it's not supposed to taste like is funky old sweat socks run through a blender. And yet. When we asked to get something different, we were given fresh hummus and questioned more about why we didn't like the baba gannhouj. The fresh hummus?   Bland.  Slimy.   And? Decoratively festooned with a giant, long, black hair. This was, as the waiter told us, "the best hummus in Phoenix". If anything here is the best in Phoenix, then I am the Queen of England and I can guarantee you, no one is calling me "Your Majesty."

GREAT place to see useful, beautiful objects from local artists. The owners are sweet as can be and even offered me iced green tea while I browsed. I will go back again and again.

This place is really cute. The food is awesome and the service is WONDERFUL. we were seated outside today because the place was packed, but it was really cold. As soon as an inside table opened up, the owner came and got us and moved us inside so we were warm. So sweet.

Sweet ladies, running a stylish, fun little shop with an active facebook page. Great shoes and bags. My only complaint is that there are little to no plus size selections for us girls with big butts. But, with used clothes, it's hard to cater.

We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and were greeted right away. The restaurant was very clean and cute. The entire staff was very friendly and the food was homey and totally had value for price. It was our first visit to Rustic Cafe, but it won't be the last!

My husband and I have learned that having a truck in Arizona means you'd better get friendly with a good glass repair person. We lucked out when we found Blue Chip. My husband has dealt with Kelly, the owne, r getting things all set up with insurance and Freddy has been his tech for both of his windheild repairs. Each time the service has been fast, convenient and awesome. We will continue to give them our business and refer them to others! Thanks, Blue Chip!

Dr Bachenheimer is awesome. She is compassionate and kind and on the cutting edge of medical knowledge. Unfortunately, I will never go back to her practice because of her front office person, Carrie. Carrie is rude, interrupts you when you speak is confrontational and completely difficult and infuriating to deal with. I have never been treated as badly as I have by Carrie.

Julie and Tia have created a comfortable, fashionable cozy studio in the Landmark. I have been seeing them for about a year now, sent friends, family and purchased gift certificates for services for people I love. I highly recommend The Phoenix Studio!

My husband and I watched an employee scoop ice into a cup, and then throw the scoop, handle and all, back into the ice. As someone who got a life threatening kidney infection by way of eColi....I'll pass. Basic sanitary standards, people. I will never be back, your tea isn't worth me dying.

This place is awesome. As with most people, I found this little place through Groupon and I am glad I did. I bought two Groupons and had no problem scheduling a saturday class for me and my friend for the 2pm saturday class for the pottery wheel. A lot of the reviews I am reading are complaining about scheduling or Groupons not being honored. Groupon is an an incredibly popular service. If you call in advance of when you want to go, and don't wait until the last minute, scheduling anywhere with a Groupon is a breeze.  This place is no different. They aren't beholden to honor your expired Groupons, you are responsible for scheduling in a timely manner.  We loved our class, and are awaiting the drying time so we can go back and glaze. This class was seriously so much fun, that I am considering buying a class for 4 when my mom and sister come out to visit. Good fun!

Bleh. Bland, tasteless pizza, squishy pasta, watery sauce. The service was lackluster and the music is LOUD. Such a bummer, since it is so close to my house.

The front room is lovely. However, the massage rooms are cramped and awkward and the one I was in had a large Xray lightbox. My massage therapist was consistently running into things and having to squeeze around the table. Stephanie was my therapist and did a serviceable job, but I had a migraine and I specifically requested on my intake form for very minimal talking.  She talked the entire time, even when she got a notable lack of response, she kept talking. I left with a bigger headache than I went in. Very disappointing.

Dr Natalie is a compassionate, empathetic, caring DC. She listens, takes her time with you and always strives not only to make you feel better, but to keep you feeling better. Her new location is adorable. I highly recommend her!

Let me start out by saying, that I loved my food. Let me also start out by saying that our table waited so long for our food that I am pretty sure I would've eaten my own eye if you'd served it to me. Walking in to the restaurant, we were roundly ignored by the staff and left to stand in the middle of the restaurant and look pitiful. AWKWARD! When we were finally seated, it took 1/2 an hour to receive water. Another 10 to get menus. Another 20 to order, then the pacing of the meal when we finally got our food was weird. Our server was incredibly odd and vacillated between incredibly intrusive and absolutely dismissive. It took one of our friends almost a full 20 minutes after we received our food to get her beer.  However, the food really was good. We ordered poutine and it was delicious. However, our waiter insisted on correcting our pronunciation of "poutine".   Me- "I'd like a small poo-tin, please" Him- " You mean, the POOOTEEN?"  Actually, I speak French and it's not POOOTEEN. Even if it was, don't be a pretentious butthead.   At any rate, great food but the service needs A LOT of work. But I will be back, if only for the POOTEEN.
