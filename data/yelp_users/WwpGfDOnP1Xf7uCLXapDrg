Absolute worst customer service ever. Completely lied to me and promised me a vehicle, then said they couldn't provide one last minute. Would rather pay double somewhere else than ever use them again.

I have used AAA auto shop the last three times I've needed service work and all three times was extremely impressed. Not only is their work high quality, but it's also done in a very timely fashion. I just had my alternator replaced and couldn't get there until a little after close and Clark offered to stay late just for me....on Christmas eve!  If you want quality work finished in a timely manner with a kind and honest staff, then this is the place to go. Thank you Clark and everyone at AAA!!! Merry Christmas:)

I went into Pet Club for the first time yesterday because I needed to switch my very picky dog's food brand. Laura was there to guide me in the right direction, and not only took the time to answer all of my questions, but the food she suggested worked! I have never seen my dog eat so much at one sitting! Thank you Laura for all of your time, patience, and expertise!!! I will be a regular at Pet Club for sure now!
