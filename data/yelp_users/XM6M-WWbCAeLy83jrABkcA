This place is affectionately called the "soupy burro" around the office. On my way there, my fellow lunchies warned about three things:  1)Be cautious of the aluminum plate they serve the burro in, its 2 degrees hotter than the deepest realm of hell and will singe your arm hair if you get too close.   2)The enchilada style burro with a side of beans is two parts molten lava, one part devils breath and two parts awesome. Be warned.  3)If you happen to get the burro traditional (without enchilada sauce) try it Gary style.(He's a guy a work) Get a side of rice with your burro and eat directly over the rice bowl because the burro WILL explode  at some point and it is better to catch the molten lava goodness with your rice than on your pants. Unless you want to melt your legs off.  All in all, it is good stuff. Small menu, outside seating, cash only, No sign on the building. Sometimes you have to arm-wrestle a junk-yard dog for a place to sit but its worth it.

Perfect for a Quick lunch. And I mean seriously quick. Like ninja light speed fast.   Under two minutes consistently from order to table. How can you beat that! One time they clock-in at 1min 45sec for a table of five.   My favorites are the House Special Chicken, the Orange chicken and the Prawns. can't go wrong and you will leave stuffed and satisfied.

I wanted to like this place, but I didn't. It was really dirty. The BBQ pork was overcooked and tough. The sauce was so-so. This place is mediocre at best. All in all nothing was really that tasty.   On the upside they have some old pinball machines so bring your quarters, wizard.  I think people give five stars to hole in the wall places just to be special.   Truthfully, I'd be surprised if my post actually gets POSTED since yelp gets paid to take down posts that aren't four or five stars.   Look into it people - do your research.

Good food must run in the family. A few months back we stopped here by chance and I am so glad we did.  Later, we found out that Los Compadres are cousins to my favorite mexican restaurant Casa Reynoso in Tempe.   So many good things to eat here I just don't know where to start. Here are some items on my favorites list:  The salsa and chips are yum-diggity.  The mexican pizza  Shredded beef taco  Bean/cheese burro (with green chili strips)  Stay away from the red chile. Not that good.

After watching Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives review of Chino Bandido i decided to give it a try. On the show the owner said you can make something like  20 thousand different combinations. Wow! Sounds great right?  To begin this multi-cultural journey I decided to look at their menu online where they have a tutorial to learn how to order. Easy enough. As I spouted out my order "can I get a combination 8, 9B JFR; BLK" I realized I had no clue what I was about to get myself into.    The combination of all of the flavors was just odd. I really really wanted to like it, but in the end it was just a heap of odd-tasting food that just didn't work. I will give it to them for doing something new, but be forewarned the jerk chicken will light your face on fire!

I have tried a few different pizza's here and recently Chad M suggested I try the meatballs and jalapeno. Seriously good! The secret to this place is to have a few toppings  instead of loaded to the hilt.  If you are not into customizing your 'Za than try the Brooklyn -  it's a favorite.

Johnnie's Garbage dog is the work of the God's. You can't go wrong with any of the dog's here so when you can't make up your mind and everything looks so good - why not just have it all! Seriously try this one.   Be forewarned it can be messy, so get a good grip because once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down.

The easy rare pho and garden rolls are delicious. The lunch special is a great deal and filling.

Yo Pauly's is the best! I felt like part of the family after being there once.   It's like taking a step into NYC. What you will find here is friendly service from a real New Yorker, either Pauly or JT, a mural of New York on the wall, a few tables and  a counter displaying pizza-by-the-slice, cannoli and garlic knots.   When I asked JT if the meatball sub was any good, he replied "i never met a meatball that I didn't like." This is absolutely the case with their meatball sub. There is no way to describe the marriage that happens between the cheese, sauce and bread. It is truly delicious. The same phenomenon happens with the pizza.   If you like NYC pizza joints  you'll love this place.

Just because it's full doesn't make it good.   When we first arrived this place as so full we barely had a place to stand. So we thought, "this place must be good." While we waited, a server came over to take our order. Then about ten minutes later we were seated.   As the food came out we both had the same reaction. Meh. The soup was flavorless, the pad thai noodles  were undercooked the sauce in the red curry was watery, so much it was nearing bland. Which is unheard of in any Thai restaurant!    I won't be going back

A definite welcome to the neighborhood!!   I was delightfully surprised at how much the store offers in such a small space. Grant it you are not going to get many choices on some items, but you may be surprised at some of the items you do find. There were plenty of choices for organic foods and "green" products, also.   The good: convenience - for those of you that has one in your neighborhood. Easy to get in and out of with front door parking.  PRICE - The prices are as low as Walmart's but without the hassle of having to deal with the super-store size. (they accept coupons too - even better)   Ready meals - Great concept. Many places do this, but I found that it was easy (and fun) to create a full meal. Main courses, salads, sides, sandwiches and desserts all labeled and located in one place. If you don't have time to cook give it a shot. It is not as cheap as cooking it yourself but lasagna for two people for six bucks isn't bad.   The bad: Stay away from the Rotisserie Chicken. A little dry and over-cooked. I've had better at Fry's, Costco. Save your tastebuds.  In a world of Mega-stores with mega-parkiing lots it is nice to have a place that is actually cheaper to go to and within walking distance.   The best way to describe Marketside is if you were to cram the Walmart food section and the Wholefoods quality and organic cool factor  in a space the size of Walgreens.

This is a great find. The sauce isn't my favorite - it's a bit on the peppery side but it's still delicious. The catfish is some of the best I've had. Very clean place and nice people. Good prices too.

This place is a solid meh. The place is clean and open and has Espn pumping through the dining room.   The staff acts like their dog just died.  The food tastes like a cafeteria. Not bad just not anything special. Too many things on the menu without doing anything right.

I love this place. The food is fresh and has a unique flavor that can only be found at Tia Rosa's. The beans are smokey and delicious. The beef is amazing. Try the red chili. It's more of a spicy shredded beef than a stew.
