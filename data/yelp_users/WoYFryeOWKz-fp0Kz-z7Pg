Best sandwiches in the Valley! I live in Gilbert and whenever I make it up to Scottsdale I have to stop by for lunch. My usual is a #5 with garlic sauce and a side of their delicious fries. Everything is top notch and I love that it is locally owned and operated. There are so many sandwich places in Scottsdale including a chain right in their complex, but Croques is my favorite!

I assumed that this was going to be a typical froyo place like Yogurtland or Pink Berry but there was not a fresh topping to be found. The only choices were different types of chocolate toppings, sprinkles, coconut, or nuts in some type of gooey sauce. Where are the fresh strawberries, blueberries, black berries, mangos, bananas etc? If I wanted frozen yogurt with hot fudge and crushed peanuts I would have gone to McD's. Very disappointing.

I really wanted to like this place but the food is so blah. I got three tacos (pork, shrimp, and shredded beef). They took the tortillas and placed then on the flat top, which I thought was to warm them up and then they put cheese on them and waited until it melted. The kept them on for so long that they all burned and black on the bottom. Then they added the meat, lettuce, pico and sour cream. There was so much juice from the meat and pico that the tacos were dripping and soggy. But the bizarre thing was that they had zero flavor. The pork meat was very sweet which was kind of a nasty combo with the pico and sour cream.  So I guess I'm the odd ball based on the rest of the reviews. I think this would be a great place for someone who does not like spices or is afraid that Mexican food is too spicey. No worries here since the food is very bland.

I love this place, I eat here at least once a week. Great food, drinks, ambience, and the best cupcakes you will ever have. The only thing they need to change if their ordering system. They hand write your order on a post it note and then walk the note over to the kitchen and then ring your order on an ipad. They need to get a pos system so they can simply ring the order in on the ipad and it goes directly to the kitchen. The current process takes way too long and is seriously frustrating since there is always a long line of people waiting to order.

Bought some today at the Gilbert Farmers market. I had to try one as soon as I got home and they are delicious. Four minutes in the microwave and boom they are hot and fresh. Love that every bite had the filling, nothing worse then  the filling only being in the very center. got 1/2 dozen of green chili pork and chicken chipotle.

I woke up this morning with a stiff neck and I thought that if I relaxed and took some Advill that it would go away. Sadly I was wrong so I decided that I needed some professional assistance. I called and they were able to get me in within an hour, thankfully! Seriously the best massage I've ever had. Last month I stayed at a 5 star resort in Florida and had a 45 minute $140 massage. My 60 minute $33 massage was 10 x's better. I was more relaxed and all of my knots and pains melted away.

The only place in the Valley that I trust for an excellent pedicure. It's only $18 and it includes a hot rock massage. What more you could you ask for? I pass dozens of other nails salons on my 30 minutes drive here but I wouldn't think if going anywhere else.

We recently moved and the windows and screens in our new home were disgusting. When we moved in I knew that we had to contact Brad asap since he had done an amazing job on the windows at our previous address. Of course I was right and he even exceeded my expectations. He really should wear an "S" on his chest and have a cape. He also found a black widow spider in our window well and took care of it for me and took pictures of some other critters that we would need to contact a pest control right away. I can't say enough about Brad and the amazing service that he provides. He is the best!

This place was amazing!! I've been traveling a lot for work so my body is all out of wack from flying and bad hotel pillows. $30 for a reflexology massage that I would gladly had paid $200 for. I can't say enough about how good it was. I feel so good!

I have great health insurance so I could go to a chiropractor and have a $10 co pay. But I prefer to go here because I do not have to make an appointment (I don't think that I've ever waited more then 5 minutes), they don't try to sell me vitamins or massages, and they don't try to convince me to pay for other services that I don't need. This is how chiropractic should be. I've been going for a month and my back is the best it's felt in years. I love this place!

Pho was excellent along with their famous orange chicken. Love the look of their dining room, very modern and fresh. Finished our meal with an excellent Thai iced tea with boba and Vietnamese iced coffee. The drinks were addicting and I may stop going to Starbucks.

Our new favorite breakfast and lunch spot. We had almost given up on finding a great authentic Mexican restaurant and we finally found one in our own neighborhood. Breakfast are excellent! We get the chorizo plate( best Chorizo we've ever had), Menudo, and the breakfast quesadilla. All are fresh, homemade and delicious! Staff is always friendly and attentive.

Joyride Taco House is AMAZING! We ate there last Sunday and I have wanted to eat there every day since.  -Trio of ceviche is delicious! So so fresh and the flavor combinations are wonderful. -Mexican street corn, yummy! -We tried the shrimp, carne asada, carnitas, and carnitas tacos and they were all good. -Banana pudding and churros for dessert, I'm in heaven. -The drinks were insanely tasty. Must trys are the Key Largo and Pineapple Mojito. Also tried the Strawberry Agua Fresca with Rum. I wanted to try them all but we were so full.  Everything was so fresh and delicious and the vibe of this place is do cool I felt like I was on vacation.

I love a good sandwich and this place has stolen my heart. I can't say enough about how amazing their sandwiches are. I had the Bill Walsh (former 49 ers coach) but I think they should change it to the Joe Walsh because this sandwich rocked! I know that sounds cheesy but it's true. The menu is huge so there is something for everyone including vegans. In my opinion a great sandwich starts with great bread and there's is right in the money! And they used this amazing garlic aioli that smells like what I imagine heaven smells like. Damn it was good! A perfect mix of turkey, cheese, avocado and the heavenly sauce. Mmm Mmm good! It's been 36 hours since I've eaten there and I think I will go back there tomorrow for lunch. I'm a little surprised about their choice for the first location in AZ. It's across the street from Fiesta Mall which is quickly closing stores. And many nearby restaurants have gone out if business. I would think that they would have chosen a spot with mire traffic. So fingers crossed that they get tons of business because if they close I'm going to have to move to California to get my fix.

Second visit in a week. I can't think of eating anywhere else! I think they put an addictive chemical in their delicious sandwiches that makes me crave it nightly! This time I tried the Tony Soprano and it did not disappoint. Again amazing bread and great deli meats. Great blend of flavors from the meat, Italian dressing and dirty sauce. I also tried the Funky Fusion chips and they were amazing! I have no idea what the flavor is, maybe BBQ and vinegar? They are so good an extremely addictive. Funky Fusion is a perfect name.  I can't wait to eat there again!

I crave good German food which is hard to find in Arizona, but I found it! I tried their daily special, rouladen which was excellent! The meat was so tender that it just fell apart when it touched my fork. The homemade mashed potatoes were thick and flavorful and were topped with the delicious rich gravy from the rouladen. There was also a side of yummy red cabbage. It also came with a cup of soup which was yummy!  I hope this place gets some traffic since it's hidden in a slow  mall on the corner of Alma School and Southern. I'll be back to try their specials again!

Tried it for the first time today and I'm already thinking about going back tomorrow.  I explained to the very friendly and knowledgable manager that it was my first time and she explained everything to me. I decided on the Tropical Cooler and it was amazing!!  The first sip was unbelievable! The perfect blend of flavors and texture was amazing! I already felt like I was doing my body good by drinking this smoothie. I will be back tomorrow and I have a feeling that my punch card will be filling up soon.

This place could be better if they improved their sauce and made some other minor improvements. We got a thin crust with onions, mushrooms, sausage and green peppers. At first I thought their were artichokes on the pizza since the mushrooms were yellow. They use canned mushrooms, yuck. The peppers were very soft so I'm guessing they pre-cook them. The onions were non-existent until I dug around and found a few of them. The cheese and crust were good. So if they would use fresh veggies and add some seasoning to the sauce and kick up the sausage  the pizza would be a lot better. We also had a pan pizza which my husband said was ok but again the sauce has no flavor and there wasn't enough cheese. We also had the wings. They were too spicy for my taste but my husband thought they were great.

After reading all of the reviews I was super excited to find a great Italian deli on the East side. DiFalcos and Guidos in Scottsdale are two of my favorites but the drive from Gilbert can be rough with traffic. The menu looked nice but I was very disappointed that all  of their cold sandwiches came with Asiago instead of fresh mozzarella. I substituted provolone instead. Also all of the sandwiches come with mustard which I'm not a fan of. I had the #2 on their homemade bread that was hard and stale. The sandwich didn't have any flavor at all. Very disappointing.  All of the desserts in the case were pre-cut with pieces of paper separating the slices which screamed that they were not homemade. Disappointing again.  I wanted this place to be good so I wouldn't have to drive to Scottsdale anymore but it just didn't happen, sadly.

So I guess that this is where you go if you have no taste buds? The pizza has no flavor what so ever. I sampled 4 different slices and they all tasted the same, blah. I tried the pasta and it was also blah. Salad bar was sad, and not many toppings. The crotons, fake bacon bits and sunflower seeds had a small cup to scoop them them out. This is nasty since you have to hold the cup to scoop out the toppings and then the cup is thrown back in the container and touches the food. Ewe!  The pizza is under what I thought were heat lamps but none of the pizza was hot or even warm. They did not bring out a fresh pizza until every slice was gone so some sat there with one slice forever.  I did try a piece of the apple dessert pizza which was ok, I tried the cinnamon slice but it was hard as a rock. Most likely because it had been sitting there forever.  I didn't see anyone over the age of 18 working there. Maybe the manager was asleep in their office?

This is our new favorite place! First time we sat at the bar in Saturday afternoon. My boyfriend enjoyed a snake bite and I had one of their signature cocktails, Grapefruit and basil martini. OMG! Where has this cocktail been all my life? It's life summer in a glass. So delicious and refreshing. Ok, I didn't have one I had three.  For food we had the scotch eggs, calamari, kale salad and pulled park sandwich. It was all delicious. The bartender was very nice and our drinks were always full.  Ate their again for dinner and the drinks and food were all excellent!
