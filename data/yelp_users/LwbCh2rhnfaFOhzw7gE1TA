I love the Pub! I don't get there very often any more but I wish I could! Trivia Night (Thursdays) is a blast! They have a Great Beer Selection, Fantastic Drink Prices, and it is always a Good time!

I suspect that the person who took my order, which was vegan, intentionally gave me a beef and cheese burrito instead. Her name was Arbiata. Or something similar. The manager was also unapologetic and  uninterested. She rudely said she couldn't even refund me unless I drove all the way back. Totally disgusted.

I have a store around the corner from CJ's , Poor Little Rich Girl. CJ's has become our favorite lunch spot. The bar food is fabulous and it is so reasonable! There is a sort of Cheers atmosphere in that if you have been in a couple of times you are likely to recognize people the third or fourth time in and feel right at home. It is a laid-back, neghborhood bar and is very popular in the hood! Cheer's, CJ - to a wonderful place have a Tuesday afternoon Jack and Diet Coke!

So rude. I would not take my children back here. They do not speak English when there is a problem. They chose to talk to each other in Spanish. That is incredibly rude, I speak Spanish fluently, I just don't look like I do.  The experience we had is not what I would expect of a place marketing to families. The guy who cut my sons hair was terribly rude. He was rough on my son's head and then didn't want us watching him finish the haircut after hurting him. That was so creepy. Apparently he is the manager today. The other person working mentioned that he is not great with people.. Kind of a problem. I think he did t want me there because I am female. They had dads back there watching their son's haircuts.

I am so happy to have found Arcadia Tavern! We have a 3 year old and a 5 month old and don't get to get out much due to the kid factor. Arcadia Tavern is a restaraunt/tavern we can enjoy and not feel as though we are inconveniencing others because we have children with us! The atmosphere is great, the food is wonderful! Met a couple of the owners on our trips there and they seem like quality people who work hard to make the place succeed! LOVE IT!

Andrea is wonderful! I did the HCG diet and lost 18 lbs! She is friendly, easy to talk with, and really is working hard to build a great business! She works hard to make sure that you are on the right track! Couldn't be happier with my results!
