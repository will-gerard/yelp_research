I was really looking forward to finding a good Chinese food restaurant, but this was not it. The only reason this gets two, and not one star is because of the reasonable prices. 12.95/person for the Mandarin Family dinner was a good deal. However, the food was flavorless, overcooked, and the atmosphere no better.   The Wor Won Ton soup was fair. The wontons had almost no meat in them, such little meat that I thought there was nothing there until I took a closer look.   The egg rolls were overcooked and the filling was not tasty.  The fried wontons, like the soup, had almost no filling. My daughter said it looked like a tiny booger. She was right.  The shrimp with lobster sauce was fair, though too salty for my tastes.   The Sweet and Sour pork - again, overcooked, burned breading on the outside.  The House Special Chicken was just OK - the sauce was thin, runny, and also overly salty.   I can't believe how many good ratings this restaurant had. I was sorely disappointed.

I love this little shop! The yogurt is yummy! I especially like the Root Beer Float, Red Velvet and Cake Batter. I also love their selection of toppings and that they include FRESH fruit like blueberries. The only downfall for me was no Reese's PB cup topping (just minis). But this is definitely my yogurt shop of choice these days.

Finally had a chance to check out Tryst and man, am I glad I did! The food was absolutely delish! The portion sizes were just right for health and hunger. The food was fresh, seasoned just right, and my salad wasn't drowning in dressing. We had the hummus trio which was excellent. The pita came out toasted and crisp which was a surprise, but I liked it! I then had the steak salad with perfectly prepared meat, and my friend had the seared ahi tuna which she kept saying was wonderful. I'm definitely heading back the next time I'm looking for a great healthy and tasty meal.  Have since been two more times! I've yet to be disappointed. The beet salad with chicken - which was amazingly moist and tender - was wonderful. My third trip I went for the Kahlua pork which I enjoyed immensely. Perfect for my heartier appetite that day. Bonus, it came with sweet potato tater tots which were crisped to perfection. Can't wait to go back.

Fantastic gel manicure! Gentle on the cuticles, largest selection of gel colors I've ever seen and didn't skimp on the polish or top coats! Great job.

Thanks to Jessica I finally got to EAT here rather than just view the food on Facebook. Everything was made to perfection from the corn cake to the poached egg and gluten free pancakes. Simply delicious!!!
