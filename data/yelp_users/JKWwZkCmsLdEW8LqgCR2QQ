My son made reservations for Mother' s day for our family and specifically requested handicapped accessible  seating.  Upon arrival we found we were seated  upstairs,  not on the main level by the handicapped entrance.  When I asked the location of the elevator I was told they don't have one..."it called legs".  (not a good response for an Iraq veteran in a wheelchair).  After being told to go back outside and up the main entrance to the upper level we found the seating involved steps.  When I pointed this out to the waitress, she suggested we just turn the wheelchair  backwards and take my son down the stairs.  When advised this was not acceptable. we were moved to an downstairs location.  This involved my son going back  down the upper ramp, outside and back in the handicapped entrance...then to the other end of the building.  This situation stressed my son so much he was unable to eat with us.  The staff at Rustlers  Roost is in dire need of sensitivity training.

Recently rented a car from Enterprise and had great service.  The car was ready, clean and the staff was great!

We made reservations for Kai for our anniversary and had the most wonderful dining experience.  The attention to detail is amazing. We were welcomed by name and the servers used out names throughout the evening (appropriately so, not over used). I have dined all over the world and this tops my list of exceptional experiences.  The wait staff's attention to detail is amazing.  They provided great information and seemed genuinely delighted to share information and answer questions on the Indian culture, foods and wine.  The food was phenomenal. As each dish was presented, the staff explained each component.  The use of Native American food throughout the menu is delicious as well as fascinating.  Unique and delightful tastes wait on every plate. The Buffalo tenderloin and Elk Loin was delicious.  Upon retrieving our car from the valet, we found 2 bottles of water, a thank-you note and chocolates awaiting.  This is truly a fine dining experience.  A little pricey, but you get what you pay for, and the exceptional food and service are worth every penny!

We had an wonderful evening with old friends at House of Tricks.  The patio seating was perfect, the food amazing and the service excellent.  The wine selection was good and I enjoyed a great glass of wine recommended by our server.  It is nice to find a restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere, amazing food and amazing service from our waiter Sean.  I first visited House of Tricks in 1990 when I moved to Tempe and this continues to be one of the best restaurants around!
