Wonderful TJ's in the same strip mall as Whole Foods.  Wow.  So I got my staples here for my trip to Sedona:  water, a great country vegetable salad with grains, tofu, sesame oil to cook it in, and some veggies for stir fry.  So happy I found this store.

Veg burgers in Vegas.  I was ecstatic!  Add on the skinny fries, and you have a great meal for about $8 and for Green Valley Ranch, that is a huge bargain.

Awesome resort.  I was able to stay there to celebrate a birthday in July, and fortunately it wasn't as hot as it usually is.  I am a wimp when it comes to heat, but the resort was wonderful, even with many things being closed.  The summer is off season for this spot.  We had a great time at the spa, and lying by the pool.  Be sure to have your food and drinks served there.  It feels so luxurious.

Ok, so here is where Yelp might have saved me, if I had seen this Before I stayed here.  But unfortunately I got the room through a bargain internet site, and didn't know the hotel I was reserving in.  Ate in the buffet and was happy with the choices (there were veg options here, and that is not always the case in Vegas).  Had breakfast at the Tea House, and I don't remember anything too bad about that.  But then it is tough to screw up breakfast.  I agree, the best reason to stay here is location and the cars.  But would I ever go back, NO, NO, NO.

Nice little shop to stop and get fueled.  The iced coffee hit the spot.  We were in unknown territory on the way out of Vegas when we spotted this place.  We were happy to find it.

Not the biggest car museum I have ever been in, nor the most impressive, but very cool.  It was fun to see Johnny Carson's old car, and the Austin Healy I always wanted as a kid.  And if you like muscle cars, you are in for a treat.  The unique thing about this museum is that you can actually BUY some of the cars.  It is billed as the biggest antique car SHOW ROOM.  But don't look for any bargains.

Very good for a fast food style restaurant.  I enjoyed the Quinoa Salad without the cheese.  Seems like a popular place for families.

Had to use the drive thru, because I was on a road trip with my puppies, and it is just too darn hot in NV to leave them in the car for any reason.  That said, I got an iced coffee and some fries, as that was all I could find on the menu that was vegetarian.  Now I remember why I don't go here.  Then I realized, if I could have only found a Taco Bell, I could have had real food!

One of a kind, must see museum in Phoenix.  What I loved was that I learned so much about instruments that came from different countries.  And because of the earphones/receiver that you wear, as you go from spot to spot, you get to hear the different instruments.  And if you ever wondered what goes into making a piano, they have one disassembled hanging on a wall.  And a Martin guitar workshop showing how those beautiful quality instruments are made.  Listen to the cathedral in the National Cathedral, and amazing coliappes and other rarely seen instruments.  I was there for just a few hours, but could spend so much more time really enjoying the different exhibits.

I was so happy to find this market, and I looked for one before I went to Phoenix, as I like to buy food for myself in a place I can trust when I am on vacation.  This location was easy to find, and on my way out of town.  I found the Beyond Meat I was craving, and even some new products for the Engine 2 diet that I didn't know existed.
