Shopping at Shane Co was so much fun! I had gone elsewhere for my engagement ring and was so disappointed with the experience so when we went shopping at Shane Co, I was expecting the worst. Diane helped us right away, respected our budget and kept offering helpful suggestions since we didn't know exactly what we wanted. My only regret is not getting my engagement ring here too.

A very disappointing experience. My engagement ring was ordered online and it's great, but I always very sincerely dread taking it to the store for cleanings and repairs. I'm always treated like I'm an inconvenience and have genuinely never had a good experience with anyone there. Having never purchased a piece of jewelry in store, I can't say they lie to get a sale but I have been lied to about their extra protection plan (which you have to purchase of you want your ring repairs to take any less than 12 weeks). I caved, bought the protection plan since my ring so far has needed repairs 2x a year and I don't want to be without my ring for 6 months out of 12. I was explicitly told with the plan, repairs would be done in-store and would take 7 days. Come to find out, that's only true if you shell out an ADDITIONAL rush fee. Otherwise, they're still done in store, but it will take 3-4 weeks. I called them out on this and I get treated like I'm being aggressive and absolutely nuts. I just always walk away with the feeling that my business is unimportant to them and I'm wasting their precious time with things like (mandatory) cleanings.

I posted my original review back in 2013 and things have really only gotten worse with customer service here. Debbie, the manager, has absolutely no problem telling you lies straight to your face. First I was lied to by her about the turnaround time for repairs if I bought their additional warranty. Then I was lied to about the repairs being done in the store. She finally agreed to "allow" my repairs to be done in store with a due date of 12/12, after being told by C.C. that my ring was "too old" to be eligible for repairs (lifetime warranty, anyone?) and then got upset with ME when I got upset, stating that she doesn't know, she hasn't been there for 2 years, she needs to check with Debbie. I called today to check the status and they don't even HAVE an in-store jeweler anymore since they've moved locations. If she just would have mentioned that they no longer have an in-store jeweler, it wouldn't have been a problem. Why lie, Debbie? I don't get it. I'm still treated as an inconvenience every single time I'm in there. No one even greets me, I have to be the one to announce that I need help. I spoke with Katie today and was assured my repairs were on target to be back on 12/12 as promised, but I'm very skeptical (although Katie is the first pleasant person working for Zales I have ever spoken to).

The cashiers we dealt with the past 2 times we've gone were especially rude, and my expectations are generally pretty low. If we have a question, it's met with an eye roll. Our orders are never right. The last time we ordered, we asked for a medium fry, which we didn't get. We saw on the receipt that they put through the order for the fries and then removed it like they cancelled it. Certainly not the end of the world but annoying anyway.

The food and service here are always great. The bad reviews seem to center on alcohol, but I can't say I've ever bought a margarita or beer here. I've never had a complaint and I will keep coming here for good food and friendly service.

Shopping for my wedding dress here was beyond expectation. Jill was patient with me and so helpful (and honest!). When I found two dresses I loved equally, she had absolutely no problem helping me in and out of them 4 times each so I could really decide (like I said, she was patient). I finally ordered my dress and got a lovely handwritten note in the mail thanking me and telling me when to expect my dress. It arrived on time and everyone was just as friendly when I stopped back in to pick it up. I couldn't be happier!

I picked out my dress in January 2012 and got measured for it in September.  I got a phone call a month later that they can't find a manufacturer to make my dress. Ok,disappointing, but I was offered a refund or the opportunity to pick a new dress. When I arrived at the salon again, there was the dress I picked out, still on the rack (and not the rack designated as sample only; the rack of dresses available to be ordered.) I asked about it and got something of a brush off answer, no real explanation.  A lot of questions I asked needed to be directed to the owner, who was not answering or returning phone calls. I ended up requesting a refund as offered, but no one seemed to know how to issue one and, again, no response from the owner. I was also told they had no record of how much I needed to be refunded as my receipt was with the unreachable owner. Fortunately I had my copy with me, but still walked away with no refund. The only redeeming quality the shop has that I experienced was Megan, who helped me all 3 times I visited the shop.

This place is weird! The service is not friendly and in fact pretty awkward. The food was bad. Everything was cold and had no flavor. The music is super loud, the chairs (at least the 3 I tried) were quite wobbly. I definitely won't be back, I can't even think of one nice thing to say.

Awesome! Debbie is amazing. I had a vague idea of what I wanted for my wedding flowers, and she took every idea and ran with it. Wonderful!

This was a very fun experience! We tried the alien escape room and really had a good time solving all the puzzles. Chan and Jeff were incredibly nice and it was a pleasant experience from the moment we walked in. We would definitely go back to try the other rooms! Not a scary experience at all, which I was sort of worried about because I can be a little jumpy.
