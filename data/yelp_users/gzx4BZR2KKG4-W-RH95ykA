The security guard who works at the front desk is rude, unfriendly and offensive as can be.  He seems to think he owns the place and bosses people around.

I have not met a doctor who has refined the Rt of brushing off pzt ients btter than Lawrence Kramer.    After been show into the treatment t  room, I was asakved by the assistant: 'so what is your problem today? ' i told them it wasnt a problem but i was just having some symptoms. Nevertheless, after the doctor came in, his eyes were. glued to the computer screen and I think he only glanced my way f or a second.  after rhe entered some stuff into the computer and asked me a few questions, the session abruptly ended when he simply walked out after about five minutes.

manager Veronica delivers the best service. I ordered a dish that was too salty and she was courteous all the way and made sure I got a different dish. Thank you for the excellent service!

ASU wants all the money you have and more. Watch out for the parking patrol.  They will issue you a citation regardless of circumstances. I wouldn't be going here if it weren't for my classes.

I needed new brake pads and rotors put in and Isaac was kind enough to promptly do it. After driving it between scottsdale and phoenix, however, it started hissing and later on making a loud grinding noise, a metal on metal sound. I called Isaac back only to be told that was normal.  When the sound got worse, I had to just stop at the nearest mechanic in Phoenix and came to find out the clips were not properly put on.  I am disappointed bec I thought I could count on Tri City to get the job done right.

ON a sunny beautiful Saturdy, I came to the library to do some studying.  On the 2nd floor I find myself a station. Before I knew it a conversation started to the right of me where 3 african men were openly chatting very loud. This continued for about 10 minutes without anyone saying anything.  When I looked in their directions, they simply continued and another library staff walked by as if there's nothing going on.  i look to my right and there is a man cehcking out soft porn, while punching on chips.  He wiped his fingers cleaned and then proceed to type on the keyboards.  Another glance showed this is the mecca of the homeless (no offense to them). where every other person is sort o a 'bag' person who hasn't showered in days.  As beautiful and modern as this buidling is, it's a shame the staff do not care to maintain and the patrons have no respect for it.

I love this Walmart for the consistently superb customer service I've received even though I am not even a frequent shopper.  A big thank you to the manager Garrett (sp?) who went above and beyond his duties to resolve an issue I had with an online order!  The auto shop guys are awesome as well in helping me with little things like light bulb changing and tire air filling.

New to Scottsdale, I needed a specific type of screws for my stool.  I walked into the store on the lumber delivery side.  After finding the goods, I went to the cashier closest to that door to check out. Since there was a customer with a lot of stuff, I ran over to the self-check out on the other side of the store.  Quickly purchased the $1.24 screw, and ran back to the door I had entered. Just as I was leaving the store, a middle-age blonde woman (who was the cashier) came chasing after me asking if she could see the receipt.  I showed it to her only to hear her tell me, "now I need to check your bag as well'. Hmmm, is this racial profiling?  I only had my wallet with me and the screws (which weighed more like 3 oz) were in the plastic bag.   I drove home not thinking anything of it.  AS it turned out, the screws were not the right type so I had to return to the store to get something else. I told the head cashier in customer services and she apologized and let me know if was not 'normal' or acceptable behavior. I"ve been to other LOwes , HOme depot, and Ace and I"ve not been treated as such.  Something to think about.

I walked in the post office a minute before they closed. I went to look for a box. An elderly 50-some year old Hispanic-looking man in uniform comes over and asked if I needed help. Surprised by this friendly gesture, I started telling him what I was looking for.  Before I knew it, he had walked away as if he never saw me or said hi to me and started helping someone else. Okay, maybe he has ADHD. Fine I went to wait in line.   As I was waiting, he came back and told me they were closed already and that I would have to come back the next day. I told him I walked in before they close and that he has asked me if I needed help but didn't carry through.  He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about and simply said if he did it for me he would have to do it for other people. I look at the line and there is only one person ahead of me.   This is not the first time I've had bad experience with this post office.

good luck dealing with your shipment if you do come here!   The behind-the-desk ladies must be trained in meanness school.  The staff are mean as hell!!!!   Not just once but twice, I asked a older looking brunette lady for a little piece of tape for my envelope.  She gave me the rudest look and told me they have tapes for sale when it was obviously all i needed was a one-inch scotch tape to seal my envelope.  Another time I had to mail a package and I asked  for a marker.  Again, she gave me the dirty look and just said we do not give out markers.  I did not say anything to her but I went to the bank (wells fargo) and they kindly gave me tape and marker without asking anything. I would not use this post office unless my life depends on it!!!!!!   I would just use the machine so I don't have to deal with the brunette lady!
