I have been here twice, and both times were amazing.   The atmosphere is simple yet polished. You could enjoy it dressed down or up. The restaurant feels like it wants you to just enjoy the meal.   The service was fantastic. Everyone was attentive and knew the menu.   Most importantly, the food is exquisite and worth every penny. Yes, it can be expensive and the portions small, but every dish highlights the flavors and textures of all its ingredients, which are fresh and sometimes local.   If you're worried about cost, go with a friend and split it down the middle. You'll have more bang for your buck and still walk out satiated.   Hands down the best Japanese in Phoenix.

My girlfriend and I decided to try this place after seeing it featured in a food magazine. I don't know why the magazine chose this establishment because it isn't that awesome. Fact: it sucked.   The service was horrible because we hardly had any. It took about 20 minutes to order and another 30 minutes for the food to come out. My girlfriend's order was wrong, and mine took an additional 10 minutes after hers and my sister's came out.   If only the food were good. Their brats were flavorless, and their buns fell apart too easy. The only delicious thing was the Thai ketchup. Everything else was mediocre to average at best. You could probably make it better yourself.   I wanted to like it because the atmosphere/environment is interesting/hip (in an urban hipster way) and it has the same owner as La Bocca, which I love. It's just... I wasn't drunk enough to think any of it was worth it.

I came here on a whim because I wanted something sweet. It didn't disappoint.   The service was quick and friendly and the donuts delicious. I came in thirty minutes before it closed, and surprisingly, the donuts were still soft and melted in your mouth. I had the custard filled and blueberry cake (soo good).   Also, if you like boba, the taro is creamy and boba freshly made.   I will definitely be back.   Bomb (dot) com.
