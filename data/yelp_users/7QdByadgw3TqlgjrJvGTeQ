Although there is lots of fun to be had here- the atmosphere of the show does not make up for the lack of cleanliness and overall "ICK" factor.  I love me some dive bars, but this one was a little too subterranean.  That and please, ladies- when you are lip syncing, at least know HALF of the words to the song.  Just moving your mouth and jaw like an automaton is NOT fun or attractive.

One of my favorite places to dine out. LOVE the atmosphere in the basement!  If you ever have the opportunity reserve the banquet room-it is a must do!  The staff kept the drinks full and plentiful all night, dinner was hot and DELICIOUS! (Surprise I had the filet ,asparagus and sweet potato) And if you have friends like mine that are a bit boisterous (you know who you are) the banquet room creates a nice buffer between your party (literally) and the more sedate diners.  The menu has some less traditional items- like the twice baked sweet potato served in a chile...MMMMM. Or the shredded crab meat that tops the steak...This is a Phoenix institution- and a must try.  You can't call yourself a Phoenician if you haven't dined here.

This place takes hole in the wall to a whole new level. Tucked in BEHIND the petsmart. I am not a hockey nut by any stretch- but this is the IDEAL bar for anyone that is. The bar faces the glass behind the goalie- there are several flatscreens placed throughout the bar-All sporting a hockey game. LOT of beer options, a whole LOT. Very cool place.

The place is a nice backdrop for Jennifer "J" that does my hair. She is a fantastic colorist.  I won't go to anyone else.  Definitely worth the thirty minute drive.

A group of 7 families decided to book a family stay-cation for the Fourth of July at the Marriott Tempe Buttes for the first time.  The property is beautiful and well maintained, the check in staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool attendant Krystina was the absolute best. However- we did have some very serious service related issues with our stay: 1.  The main reason for staying at the Buttes was to spend the day at the pool so the kids could play on the water slide.  By the end of the day the little ones all looked like they had been used as whipping posts from the bruises and scrapes left from a too-dry water slide. ALL of the kids had multiple bruises and scrapes on their little backsides and backs.  That is unacceptable! A total safety issue that needs to be rectified.  2. Prior to arrival, we had checked with the front desk to clear snacks and water bottles at the pool.  Once given the go-ahead we pack the standard: water bottles, goldfish, popcorn, etc. Upon entering the pool our bags were searched for alcohol.  Anytime the pool manager walked by our area, our bags were searched again.  This happened SEVERAL times.  I can see searching once for due diligence- but after the second or third round- it was frustrating, humiliating and embarrassing. We didn't even stay pool side long enough to watch the fireworks from the pool due to the whole situation. Spent $145/night to sit in the hotel room.  3. Although I love a good party, and can not fault the staff for noise levels of guests due to celebration, it took 3 calls from 11pm-3am for staff to finally knock on neighbors door and insist on quiet.  Definitely not my best hotel experience. I honestly do not see myself going back to a Marriott property anytime soon.  Normally I will give a place a second or third chance before bashing them online, but this whole experience was incredible- in the worst possible way.

Mmmm! You have got to love being able to drop in and for under $5 get a huge slice of pizza, a soda and a salad.  For some reason the pizza always tastes better from the warmer! The chicken hawaiin pizza? HELLO HEAVEN!

I love this place!  I am married to an East Coaster- and he LOVES this place. ( You know how the NJ & NY natives are always ALL about the pies & the bagels!) The bagels are always fantastic with many variations- and the place does a steady stream of business starting at 6am.  If you are a salt bagel junkie- make sure you get there before 9am on Sunday- those seem to always be the first gone.

This is one of my favorite places to go.  I almost always have the Filet with a loaded baked potato and a glass (or two) of merlot. The staff is always courteous and quick, the food is always cooked perfectly- it is a little on the pricey side though...Especially if you have any drinks while you are there.

This place is SO SMALL, but the sound system is GREAT, and they play a nice selection of blues-y rock, classic rock , southern rock, and a sprinkling of honky tonk country. I had a BLAST. One of the better dive bars that I have had the pleasure of drinking in. Very relaxed atmosphere, mostly the 30something to fifty something crowd...perfect place to go have a drink after work.

This is bar none, har de har, my favorite bar. Had some really great times here. The drinks are always good- which is not always the case when you like the fruity frou-frou drinks- and I do!  I have tried several different things on the menu and have never had anything to complain about. Definitely better than your average bar food here. They have the BEST pizza and wings. And for those of us with A.D.D. they have 70 some odd televisions to keep you good and distracted. AND- they always have FUEL on at least a few of those- which I appreciate, because I enjoy the extreme sports rather than the standard men in tights- chasing balls -stuff that most seem to like  :-)

Love this place.  The deliveries are always CRAZY quick, the food is hot & fresh. Generally I get the Veggie fried Rice- has a TON of broccoli and other veggies in it, not all bamboo shoots and water chestnuts like some of the "other" joints in the area. My kids love the orange chicken, or chicken fried rice, and the hubby is a huge fan of the house chicken.  You get a TON of food, and the prices are very reasonable.

Great price, great service. Not a high end salon by any means- but if you need a trim, cut,color on a budget OR need an eye brow wax, it's a great place. $11.95 for kids, $13.95 for adults, and they ALWAYS give good coupons with each service.

This is a smaller store- but they have a great selection of fish & reptiles, and the necessities for each. I learned more in five minutes talking with an employee about our beardie than any of the other petshops combined. I always prefer to give my cash to the small businesses when I can. Great place, and they sell cheaper used aquariums/terrariums as well.

I have now done two work related dinners here. The food is always top notch, and the service is impeccable. The real jewel of this place is The Jade Bar, however.  I love a bar that I can say " I like frou-frou rum drinks", ad after the laughter dies down- they fix me up with a tasty, and stout beverage.  I have not been able to utilize the resort side- YET. But one day... The views of the valley at night are spectacular. This is a great place for a romantic date.

The Jade bar is beautiful and scenic as it sits atop the mountain, and the majority of the bar is either open or floor to ceiling windows. The bartenders know their stuff and the drinks are not as expensive as you would think given the ambiance and location.  One of the most romantic spots in the valley.  Has a great, scenic outlook over the lights of Phoenix, and with the light splash of lights on the grounds it is a perfect back drop for that romantic night out (above) on the town.

I can't really remember what I ate while I was here...The drinks, however were plentiful and potent. (Grin, wink, wink)  I love the atmosphere, being born a desert rat (that is hillbilly minus the hills, frills plus cacti) I loves me some honky tonk! This place fit the bill, the band was fun, played a nice gamut of country gold, honky tonk, and new age country. My little and I had a great time cutting up the dance floor to it. Fun place to bring the munchkins (or your mate) for some "San Antonio Stroll", steaks and whatever else you fancy. PLUS- you just can't beat Carefree on a warm, spring night. You just can't- everything else is just icing.

I don't even normally LIKE philly cheese steaks- but the sandwiches here are AMAZING! They put cheez whiz on them. WHAT?! I know, sounds completely revolting, right? Turns out it isn't. I though cheez whiz was E-Z Cheez. Nope, it is something completely different. Combine that with the grilled onions, and perfectly grilled steak chunks? Hello taste bud meltdown experience.    And the Cheez Whiz fries with grilled onions? HOLY Mother of God are those GOOOOOD! I don't even want to take a guess on what the caloric intake is on either- but if you don't care, or only want to eat once that week anyway- take a trip to Corleone's. You won't regret it. (Well, you may if you don't wear your stretchy pants when you go)

I have been going to Valle Luna since I was a kid. It is one of the few places left in Phoenix that is relatively unchanged.  I always have a good time, great service and good food. And the house margaritas are always plentiful. MMMM, margaritas.......

Nice, little family owned and operated style store. Very friendly- and when I needed to sell off some jewelry for some extra cash- they were fair and didn't make me feel like a low life thug slinging stolen wares.  As soon as the economy bounces back and I have money to spend on jewelry again- I will be buying all of my jewelry here instead of in the chain stores. I will be tken a broken engagement ring here for repair- and will let you yelpers know how they are with repairs soon.

Well- it's a subway. So the the standard sandwiches and services apply. I have never had bad service or food here- but the restaurant down on 43rd ave and Bell is generally cleaner, and the staff is a bit more friendly and outgoing.

Yes, this is a chain restaurant, and maybe I shouldn't get too excited over a standard hamburger chain-but what can I say? I love french fries! And Red Robin gives you bottomless steak fries. That's right, I said bottomless. steak. fries.  Delicious.  Oh, and the beer is always so cold that ice chips float in it. For those of you that enjoy that sort of thing.

The motif was interesting- not much of a "modern" buff myself.  The location is good, the food was good- the "gourmet bread" was not the best- unless by "gourmet" you mean charred- if that is the case- it was excellent!  The food choices were all  interesting- the sandwich I had that had goat cheese was pretty good- but not anything to write home about. The service for a party of ten was not the best- even though we had the entire second floor to ourselves- they only had two servers on at noon on a Friday at lunch. Not the best planning. Also, word to the wise ladies- do NOT sit your purse on the counter in the restroom. It LOOKS like a counter- but is a motion sensitive sink. Glad I have fast relfexes and a dry wallet! Just sayin'.  So, all in all, an OK place for lunch, but I wouldn't make a special trip here for lunch or dinner.

One of my favorite places to go to for kid's birthday parties. Why, you ask? Because the party itself is DOWNSTAIRS and away from the jangling machines and sugar crazed munchkins. You do the cake, presents, food the kids scramble up the stairs or elevator- and you can either enjoy the semi-quiet of the party area or go upstairs to play and watch the munchkins. Now that mine are older- I am LOVING the option to OPT OUT of the gaming area.

I loved the food here. The ambiance not so much- the TVs were crazy loud and the interior was very similar to Rodibertos. However, they had ice cold bottled " Mexican"  Coke, and the BEST street tacos I have ever had. Delicious! Super fresh salsa, plentiful lime wedges, And so much steak it was a tough job to power it all down. I mean, I totally did- but it was a bit of a challenge. The rice was only OK, and the beans were so-so. But the tacos were crazy good. They were also quite speedy which is always good when you are on lunch break.

I have to say that I was much more excited about this place BEFORE I went to it. It isn't a bad bar, per se- but definitely did not live up to the hype. and the drinks are more pricey than they should be for the flavor.  If I can make a better margarita than a place called "Margaritaville", well- then I will save myself the money and make them at home.  However- when they do the live music on the weekends- it is a great time.

If this had an "adult beverage section" it would be 5 stars. I love that the concession stand has White Castle Sliders. I don't know why they taste so much better here than they do out of the boxes in the freezer section- they must have better microwaves- but they do.  I never have a crazy long wait, the service is always good, and fairly fast in comparison to thier competitors-ahem! You know who you are! AND- you can get weird flavored toppings for your popcorn here- unlike aforementioned competitior. LOVE Harkins! Love Harkins Norterra MOST.  Also- the $1 refill cups that you can use all year round? GREAT idea.  Saves me quite alot of soda money in the long run.

I don't hit the corporate crack pipe too often, but when I do, I love me some banana nut loaf and Chai tea! For some reason though- this location, the last couple of times that I have ordered the bread it has been semi-stale.  I mean, at 490 calories a whack- it should taste PHENOMENAL!

I love being able to go to an early movie and only paying $5 to see a movie. Which is a good thing- because cheap is NOT the adjective that can be used to describe the concession stands.

Cute little neighborhood bar. Not my cup of tea- but seemed to the perfect place for the guy that just wants to watch the game -and not be distracted by any courtship rituals...There was a small percentage of women there- but looked like that is what they were there for too.

This is such a wonderful service! Altered tails provides low cost spay and neutering services for dogs and cats. When I broght in my boxer there were several repeat customers there, so that has to say something. The volunteers are all very friendly and caring.  The facility was clean, and my dog had no ill effects from his surgery. I would definitely recommend this place versus a standard vet. My vet wanted over $300 to neuter, altered tails charged $95.  There is a bit of a wait at drop pff and pick up- but for those of us struggling a bit financially- well worth the time.

Just a quick update- Altered tails runs regular specials for kitties to come in and get "fixed up" for $25.00.  This is just a really nice option. Even if you have pet insurance, and can afford the regular vet fees- most of us know someone that can use the assistance.

I personally like this place. They have play areas set up for smaller kids, and everyone here seem to genuinely enjoy the work, and most importantly, are gentle and compassionate. These are not always qualities found in a dentist office. So, hate on the trains all you want, but while hanging around with your mouth open, it gives you something else to stare at besides the hygienist.

I love this place.  Right around the corner from my house, the breakfast is CHEAP, cheaper and cheapest- HOWEVER- the food is actually good here. Beats Denny's (barf) and Waffle House (double yak) hands down every time on quality, cleanliness and price.  Also- you have to go in for no other reason than to see if you can watch the clock without developing a "Butterfly Effect" eye twitch or brain spasm. If you don't know what I am talking about- you just have to go in and see!

HOLY COW! An entire WALL of frosty specialty drinks?!?! Are you kidding!?!  I had a standard cheeseburger and it was phenomenal. The service was great- the flourescent green sodas that my kids chose from the wall were good. Weird, but good. Had a great time here with the family, will definitely go back the next time we are all in the mood for burgers and sodas.

I wish I had known this was closed as well. We camped out near here and thought would be a great photo opportunity- Alas, the gates were closed, the signs were hung- and the fence was BARBED.  First time I had seriously considered trespassing- it looked like such a great spot for old timey photos, was tough to resist!

A handful of things feel as good as a great pedicure. A little under a year ago I stopped in here to spend some of my hard earned cash, and loved it. So- needing a pedicure in the worst way- and not generally  having pedi money in the budget anymore, I figured, I would stop in and see how Andy's place was holding up, and if it was a good as I remembered.  Yep- still love this place! Andy keeps his store CLEAN and friendly! Competitive prices, and he is an artistic genius when it comes to nail designs. Plus, he is a smart aleck- which I LOVE.  Also- had my very first cup of REAL green tea- complete with tea leaves. ( yes, I am VERY American- and was a little shocked at the taste difference- but it was interesting. )

The hubby uses Wolz's every year for my anniversary flowers. Think he has used them for all 20, and they have never let him down. Flowers are always gorgeous, fresh and creative.  It's a small business, and we always try to go small business over big chain.
