I've been in and out of Sky Harbor quite a bit and it's wearing thin on me.  Here are the things that keep it from being a good airport:  1)  The rental car center, accessed by lumbering buses, is too far away and is heinously slow for picking up a car.  If you are going to shunt your rental car center to some godforsaken corner of the valley, couldn't you at least arrange a dedicated skyway for the buses or a tram or monorail or train that whisks arriving passengers there?  This is one of the few things SFO has done well, while Cleveland Hopkins and Sky Harbor have done it poorly.  2)  The food options are not all that great, and as one other reviewer noted, the best bits are outside security!  Who has the cool and collected psyche to sit there idling away over a meal while gigantic queues may be forming, unseen, at the security gate while you linger?  When I arrive at an airport, my goal is to get through security at the earliest possible moment to avoid any nasty, nerve-wracking surprise death marches.  Which brings us to....  3) The security lines are WAY too understaffed for the size of this operation.  Narrow little chokepoints with TSA agents of the bellowing variety, and rarely more than two lines open to get into any concourse, unless you want to walk endlessly to see if the line is shorter at another entry.   Heinous!  4)  Add in an unimaginative mix of vendors and drab, Houston Bush-esque brown decor and you've got a dreary experience whether it's your destination, your departure point, or a hub for transfers.

Even if you gave up on Andy when he started coloring snapshots of Liza, you should not miss this place if you are anywhere nearby.  To see Andy's work collected in one place and arranged in a chronology is to really appreciate what he achieved.  The building itself is a perfect showcase.  I love the cloud room that recreates the famous "factory" and the room full of his Mao's. The best room is the one that shows his early career as a shoe illustrator for department store advertisements.  I wish they would issue some good Mao posters.

Stuck in Pittsburgh overnight at some crappy business hotel?  Live a little!  Flip off the tube, put on some non-descript clothes, get a cab, and tell the cabbie to take you to Primanti's in the Strip downtown.  The original Primanti's is open 24 hours and serving up their signature sandwiches with the fries and vinegar-pepper coleslaw IN the sandwich.  These are among the best sandwiches I've ever had, anywhere, period, and I say that as a Clevelander who would normally die before praising anything about this town.  Fries in the sandwich make it special but everything about these sandwiches are scrumptious.  I love the classic corned beef verions but I also like it with  ham, fried egg, cheese, the fries, and of course the cole slaw.  I love this part of Pittsburgh and try to get a Primanti every time I come to the Steel City.

Our company held our fourth annual user conference here, and compared to our previous venues, this one was a smash hit in terms of facilities.  It compares particularly favorably with the doudy, sour old St. Francis in San Francisco, a venue I hope we never book again.  The standout quality of this place is the hustle and quality of the service.  Our opening night reception included an array of food service stations with different themes, including a noodle bar that was particuarly well done.  The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable, attentive, extra-mile oriented staff.  They were reading the nametags of our 200 guests and calling people by name whenever possible and chatting us up in line to make sure we were all happy.  The event coordinators were all over the venue throughout the ensuing two days.  Where at the St. Francis we struggled with temperature and electrical problems and grumpy, uncooperative, disinterested staff, here at the Fairmont, the very few glitches drew aggressive responses by people who cared about our event.

This is a very Stepfordesque DSW, but then again, it is Scottsdale.  In fact, this DSW is kind of freaking me out a little bit.  I visited this unit on an emergency basis--I flew all the way to Phoenix for our user conference and discovered, when I arrived, that the only shoes I brought were the ratty tennies I had on to walk the dog that morning before bolting for the airport.  I had 1 hour to find dress shoes and with a little sleuthing on Yelp found this huge, seemingly spanking new mall complex and what I *thought* was a brand new DSW.  I mean, the whole damn complex looks like it was just built, and the DSW is one of the nicer ones I've been in, very orderly, spacious, and filled with brand names like the Florsheim cap-toes with non-torture features (they're some kind of sub-brand within Florsheim with all kinds of bouncy cushioning and support to keep your feet from turning into hooves, but I'm too lazy to go see what the sub-brand is).  Another review (there are three listings for this DSW on Yelp, so it's not only another review but another listing) mentions that it has already been remodeled.   I mean, there is no way this store is more than about 2 years old, and it could pass for opened last month.  They got nothing else to do that they remodel stores that have only been open 2 years?  Sheesh.  Shouldn't they be building more DSW's further out into the desert, in order to achieve their goal of growing Greater Phoenix out to the Arizona state line in every direction by 2012?  Anyhow, compared to the DSW in the Union Square district in San Francisco, this one is so clean, tidy, and untrafficked in the middle of the day you could eat scrambled eggs off the floor without picking up anything untoward.

Wow, the other reviews here might be from local renters, because I have rented cars several times here at Sky Harbor and the Enterprise operation is easily the worst at this airport.  You get to stand in line at one counter upstairs with every third golfer in the world, while three admittedly cheerful but way too slow employees work their way through the EIGHTEEN parties in line in front of me--I am not exaggerating, it was a weekday and there were EIGHTEEN people in line at this Enterprise counter in front of me, and the line took 30 full agonizing minutes to wind its way to me.  Then, the upsells started.  Don't I want a class up from "intermediate" for $5 bucks a day more?  Even though the company was paying for this rental, I said no.   Don't I want this that and the other thing?  Am I sure I don't want to upgrade?  This car won't have electric mirror controls!  After painstakingly assuring the upseller that I had no intention of upgrading, he finally and regretfully gave me my contract and sent me to the escalator to go down to my car, where I found out I had to wait at YET ANOTHER COUNTER, this time to be chatted up by two more cheery, bustling employees.    Yes, they offered me a bottle of water, but this was all taking way, way, way too long.  Another upsell attempt (when did the little Sentra become an intermediate?); fending off inquiries from the vaguely missionaryesque dudes at the counter about why I came to Phoenix and what line of work I'm in and do I golf; the second (actually third) guy finally walked me to my car, where we had to do a full pre-flight walkaround.  I mean, there was constant scribbling in contracts.  Jeeminy Christmas, this is taking 45 minutes at this point!  FINALLY they let me go!    Look, this rental car center is TOO FAR from the airport, but that isn't Enterprises's fault.  But knowing that people are already annoyed with the bus ride and the queuing of the bus out front while the clock ticks up and the air traffic controller-like ground crew waves the bus into it's enormous dock out front, couldn't Enterprise do something to speed up the queue, the checkout process, and the getting-you-on-the-road part?
