Stopped by for the first time to get flowers for the lady.  I requested something with sunflowers in a short square vase. They were very helpful, but something together and showed great creativity.  Those flowers have been on display in her home for over a week and they're still going strong. I'll be back for more in the near future!

This had to have been the worst portion serving of chicken I have ever seen at a #chipotle.  It was consistently poor with other people they were serving too.  I estimate at about half the normal serving I usually get.  I just happened to go to this chipotle today since I had an appt in the area.  I'm never coming back to this one for lunch again.  I suggest going to one of the other many chipotles to get a better serving.

I don't have a lot of experience being at Animal Hospitals or dealing with Veterinarians but in terms of people skills, handling our little guy and communication they exceeded!!!  Dr. Page Mader was incredibly friendly and communicated procedures before diagnosis.  She was very informative, caring and answered all our silly questions with patience and understanding.  She worked very well with our Chihuahua and he seemed to be very comfortable with her as she handled him.  I hope we're never back other than routine check ups but if we ever need pet emergency services we'll be back.  They were a great option on a late Saturday afternoon when most places were closed and we'll be a customer of theirs moving forward.  We appreciate your efforts UAH and you Dr. Mader!!!

Had the Family Feast and it did not disappoint!!! The ribs were fork tender, great smoke flavor and smoke ring!  Their mustard sauce on their smoked sausages were great!  We ordered coleslaw as a side and made pulled pork mini burgers with the slaw which had great crunch texture and not overpowering in flavor.  Great balance!  Also included was smoked chicken and brisket.  Man was that some good eating!!!  Chicken was fork tender and the brisket falls apart easily with great flavor. I WILL be going back and think it's some of the best BBQ in the valley!  They did have these marshmallow bacon brownies that are on my list of items to try next!!!

I rate them so low due to several issues experienced in one visit with service of the kitchen and staff.  The food quality was excellent, however the experience could be attributed to numerous scenarios such as a new restaurant, kitchen, food runners, or servers all culminating in this less than ideal experience.  I do credit the manager with taking steps to correct the experience only after I had to ask for the manager to visit the table a second time.  Let me explain...  Lunchtime service there is a zoo.  They're in a great location and they have a good reputation for a quality product.  This was my first visit with a co-worker.  Service took a little longer to visit the table and get our drink order but that's not a major issue for me, since it was busy.  I went with the Zinburger with kobe beef and zucchini fries.  Some of the questions I was getting from the server gave me the impression she was new, and I asked her to confirm that she got the Kobe beef upcharge for my burger.  My dinning buddy ordered a regular burger with truffle fries.  The burgers took some time to get out, most likely due to how busy they were.  As we noticed tables around us getting their burgers we figured we were next.  Then the table that sat and ordered after us got their order and I felt a mistake was made. Then the truffle fries were dropped off at our table, with nothing else. The food runner dropped food off at the wrong table and never confirmed the order with the guests.  That was our order.  Shortly after the server came by and realized the issue I had already discovered.  She apologized for the confusion and the manager came by to apologize for the issue as well.  Our order was remade and delivered.  My burger was overcooked but it was still delicious.  The quality of product is very good.  My zucchini fries were seasoned and breaded nicely but I would have preferred them a little more crispy on the batter.  I informed the server that my burger wasn't cooked correctly and showed her and she agreed claiming to inform the manager.  I wasn't about to send this burger back because I was teetering on hangryness.  Once the check came out they comped my burger, which I noticed didn't contain my upcharge for kobe.  So I ate a non-kobe burger after I specifically asked, and checked that it was included?  Additionally, I was not thrilled that they were insulting me by asking us to pay for the other items.  So I had to request the manager again and after I pointed out the lateness of the food and the incorrect burger and it being overcooked she said she would comp the entire meal.  That was the correct course of action in my opinion however I should have never had to request to speak to the manager a second time. We did leave +20% tip in cash and I hope this proves to be a good learning and training experience for them.  I think this will be a great spot for burgers but maybe they still need to figure out their logistics. I still want to try that Kobe burger but may need to wait on a day they won't be busy in a lunch rush and they've worked out their kinks.
