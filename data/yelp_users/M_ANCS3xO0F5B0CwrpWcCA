This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch. The food is delicious and not too pricey and I love the fact that it is healthy. One of my favorites is the Lean Turkey Pita. I just love their slaw. There is no maynnaise - just green onions, feta cheese, and their terrific greek dressing. They also have great pasta salad and their chicken roll-ups are fantastic. You absolutely have to get a piece of their chocolate cake as well. It reminds me of my mom's Texas Sheet Cake and it's so good! They also have dinners to go that are amazing.

Came here for a birthday party with about 13 of us from the office. Food was good and the price was right. I had the lunch combo with the 4 cheese Mac & cheese with bacon and honey pepper chicken and the California shrimp salad. Both were tasty. The best part though was the $.99 brownie bite with a tiny scoop of ice cream for dessert. Just the perfect size! Service was good especially considering how big our party was.

Went here for lunch today with three other people from work. It was packed but we were able to get a table in the back. They have some great lunch specials and I ordered the Shrimp tempura Udon soup with a California roll. The soup was good however it could have had a little more flavor. I ended up having to put in some soy sauce to liven it up a little bit. The California roll was right on and I enjoyed it. I also ordered a side if Gyoza (potstickers) and they were very tasty as well. I really like how the wrapping was thinner than most places. The bread that they give you when you sit down is very good.  They are hot and fresh yeasty rolls and it was hard to have just one. They also have a great selection of desserts as well as baked goods. I did bring home a slice of chocolate cake for hubby so I don't know how it is yet but it sure looks good! Service was very good and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. I would recommend this place and will definitely come back again.

Great sliders! Went here for lunch yesterday with a friend of mine and we used a Groupon. It's not the first time I've been as whenever I'm craving a slider this is where I head to. I love their cheese sliders and french fries. Yesterday I tried a new menu item - garlic fries. They were okay but I don't think I would get them again. If you are into Chicago's sports teams then you would love this place. All the walls are covered with Chicago sports team memorabilia. You do have to get here early as the place fills up quickly but they do get the orders out fast. They have great prices and it's a good value for lunch.

Went here last Friday night with my hubby and used a Groupon. It was great! The Groupon was good for any appetizer, two entrees, and 2 drinks. I had assumed that they would allow us to choose from certain entrees and the drinks would have to be beer or wine but I was wrong. We could choose any entree we wanted to and the drinks could be anything as well! We we started off with the calamari for an appetizer. It wasn't that great. I've had much better many times. They tasted like they were from frozen and were overcooked. We didn't end up finishing them. The entrees were perfect however. I ordered the bacon wrapped filet mignon with blue cheese crumbles. It was perfectly cooked and tasted divine. It came with mashed potatoes and broccolini. Both were very good. Hubby had the ribeye and he said it was great as well. I was able to have 2 Long Islands as my free drinks and that made me happy. The highlight of the evening was after we were done eating we went out to the patio (Front Porch) and sat out on the couches and enjoyed the music and the great weather. This is a great addition to the restaurant and I will definitely be back to just relax on the patio and try the food they have there!

Very cute place! Went for dinner with a friend of mine. Our meal started out with a couple of appetizers. We shared the scallops and the mussels. Both were very good. I ordered the salmon and she ordered the duck. Although both were very good, I honestly preferred the duck. The service was good although there were a few times when I thought that our waiter had forgotten us. For dessert we shared the espresso crème brûlée and it was okay although I think I prefer just regular creme brûlée.

Okay I have to preface this with the fact that this is been the first Taco Bell that I have eaten at in over a year. So to be honest I was expecting to be over whelmed because I have been wanting these foods forever. However I couldn't have been more disappointed. It started with the fact that when I first got there I had to use the restroom. The first stall was solidly plugged up and no way was I even venturing into it. So I went into the second stall and sat down and proceeded to complete my mission and  lo and behold no toilet paper!  So I went out to join my hubby in the ordering process and I ordered one each of all of the following: regular tostada, regular taco, a Mexican pizza, and a bean burrito with sour cream and lettuce added plus a side of salsa.  I knew there was no way I was going to eat it all but those are the items that I had been craving and I thought at least if I had a couple bites of each it would make me happy.  Hubby ordered three pieces of chicken and a side item.  So when they charged us they overcharged us (by double the price of the meal) but Hubby said I'm not supposed to mention that in this review because they did rectify it. The Mexican pizza was pretty good. The tostada actually sucked a**. Hubby's chicken was really good. The taco was good and the burrito was okay. To be honest our biggest turnoff was the cleanliness of the place not only in the bathrooms but of the dining room as well. There was more trash on the floor underneath our table when we first sat down than we had after finishing our meal. Needless to say I do not think that we will be back anytime soon. I just wish there was another Taco Bell in the neighborhood that could show this place how it's supposed to be done!

This place screwed my friend Marlena. She paid $59.99 for a service call and they said they would be back the next day and they weren't. She continues to try and call them to no avail. Now she is sitting with no dryer and out of $60!

I thought they were great. I had five watches get new batteries and have links removed to make them smaller and it only ended up costing me less than $20. They were very friendly and did the work while I waited.

Jeremy Schachter at Pinnacle Capital Mortgage was the best! He made the whole process so easy and painless. He was extremely knowledgable and patient with all of my questions. I would highly recommend Jeremy to anyone looking to buy or refinance a home.

Okay I have to say that I loved this meal. It was one of the better meals that I have had in a long time. We started off with the bacon wrapped scallops. They were on a bed of asparagus with a ginger orange sauce. Very delicious! I had the Fillet Oscar which were two fillet mignon medallions with crabmeat and a hollandaise sauce on top. They were cooked perfectly. It was accompanied by asparagus and potatoes au gratin. I also ordered a side of the brussels sprouts with bacon. They were very good. Don had the 12 ounce New York with the garlic mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas. It was cooked perfectly and he ate every last bite. I couldn't pass up dessert of bread pudding and a coffee with Frangelica and Bailey's. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. We will definitely be back!

When we got there they said the wait would be 15-20 minutes. 35 minutes later we had to ask and they said it would be another 15-20 minutes. Finally they ended up sitting us about 30 minutes later. The food was not at all what I had expected. The waffle was very plain - no garnish or anything came with it. It tasted like sawdust. The pancakes were also very bland and their syrup is very watery and jus sits ont he table so it is not warm. The whites of my eggs were runny even though I had asked for over medium and the chicken fried steak was overcooked so it the crust was hard. The sweet potato tots were mushy and lacked flavor at all. Our entire party was very disappointed.

Not that impressed. Figured that tacos would be pretty cheap on "Taco Tuesday" like their website claims but prices were $6 for two street tacos. Pretty expensive for street tacos that weren't even that great. We shared the steak, the chicken, and the pork. The pork ones were the best. Also had the chips and salsa and the salsa is a little tiny cup.  The Fundido cheese dip was good however when I asked the waitress what kind of cheese was used she couldn't give me an answer. Also spent $7 each on a house margarita that is small and served in a plastic cup. Since it was kind of chilly outside we had to sit in the one last small table inside which was a high top. So if the weather isn't nice then I do not recommend coming because over 95% of their seating is outside.

Went here for lunch with 3 friends on a Living Social coupon. I had their special brussel bacon burger that the waiter talked me into. So glad I did! It was so yummy! It came with sautéed brussel sprout leaves, bacon, cheese, and a Demi glaze sauce all on a pretzel bun. I had asked for it to be cooked medium rare and it came out medium but it was okay as the flavor really came through. I had the side of jalapeño macaroni and cheese with it and it was delicious. My friends all really enjoyed their food as well. Would have loved to have tried their gigantic cinnamon roll but as it was I had to leave with a takeout container. Looked like they had a well stocked bar as well but unfortunately I was not able to partake as we were on our lunch hour. :-(  Will definitely go back again if I'm ever over that way!

Went again for lunch today and it was good again. I ordered the same Bacon Brussels burger and it was actually better this time as they didn't over cook it. We sat outside and it was very nice!

Crystal at High Effects Salon in Suite 120 is the best! I love the way she colors and cuts my hair and I trust her completely with it. She also sells Aveda products so if anyone is looking for a stylist I highly recommend her!

Came here for the first time using a Living Social coupon. I really enjoyed it. I got the $2 Strawberry Iced Tea for checking in on Yelp and it was tasty. We started off with the pof pof (sp?) balls which were really good but beware as they are filling. They are lightly sweetened donuts and I really liked them. We each also got a meat pie and to be honest I didn't care for it too much. Too spicy for me and I just didn't care much for the taste either. I got the Jerk Chicken platter with rice and a side of plantains. All of it was excellent and I will be having the other half for dinner tonight. We will definitely be back!

Took a friend here today for her birthday lunch and really enjoyed it. We ordered two of the featured rolls and split them as neither one of us had been here before. The first one we got was the Spicy Tuna. It came with the traditional seaweed wrap and we got white rice in it. We also opted to add the tempura crunch on top. It was very tasty. The second one we got was the Crunch Daddy and I liked it best. It came with the soy wrap and we opted for brown rice inside of it. It also had shrimp tempura, mandarin oranges, jalapeño, spicy mayo, tempura crunch, and chili powder in it. We both agreed that it was the better of the two. We ended up getting the combo that came with a drink and a side of edamame. I will definitely be back as the food was good and the prices fair!

OMG!! If you are looking for an awesome burger in a fun filled place with great service then this is the place! Came here with a couple of friends for lunch on our continual quest for the "perfect burger" and we might have found it! I had the Bacon and Blue Burger on pretzel bun and it was awesome! The bacon and blue cheese is infused into the meat and it was so juicy that I needed the three extra napkins the waitress brought me. I had the Jamaican corn as the side and it was delicious! Another friend had the Mushroom Swiss and it was delicious as well. As were the sweet potato tots that came with it. Although we were totally stuffed from our burgers we had to try the "Pot Brownies" that I got a coupon for when checking in with Yelp. And we were so glad we did! A hot brownie with layers of marshmallow fluff, peanut butter cup, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate sauce - can you say divine?!  Our server was fantastic and the place has a great vibe! Will definitely be back!

I was not impressed at all with my meal. I had asked for my burger to be medium rare and it was way over done. In addition it really needed salt and pepper to improve the flavor. The DD hash that came with it was very disappointing as well. The butternut squash was way over cooked and mushy and it seems to be swimming in grease. Other items that people ordered at my table looked pretty good however so maybe I will give it another shot one day...

Went here to use a Groupon and it was pretty good! Hubby had a 12" pepperoni and I had the 12" Reggie White pizza. Needless to say we ended up boxing most of it to take home as it was way too much to eat. But they sure made good leftovers over the weekend!  We got a free order of garlic bread for checking in when we first got there and it was awesome! Lots of butter and garlic! I really want to try a cheesesteak next time we go!

I just love this place! The veggie board rocks and their pizza is awesome! Today I had the At Last (?) pizza with broccolini, corn, basil, chilis, goat cheese, and lemon zest. It's one of my favorites! Great lunch specials too!

Excellent little find! Used a Groupon and went with a friend for lunch. Started out with two sushi rolls. The first was the tempura tuna with no rice and the sauce that came with was excellent. The second was the cucumber roll with tuna, salmon, and crab and no rice. It was excellent as well! We then split a teppanyaki lunch. We chose the chicken and shrimp and it was very good. Even though we were both stuffed we decided to end our meal with the green tea mochi. Loved it! Will definitely be back if I'm ever down on this side of town again!

Went there for lunch today with a friend. The place was empty except for us and I don't really understand why. We ordered a couple appetizers to share. My favorite was the fried plantains. I ordered the Pernil which is a slow roasted pork dish and I had the yellow rice with it. It also came with a side salad which is a nice touch. The pork was delicious although it didn't seem to have as much flavor as it did the first time I came. Also there was some fat in it that I had to scrape out. It wasn't a lot but enough  for me to mention it here. My friend ordered the fried chicken and yellow rice. She enjoyed it and said she would definitely come back. I love that they have the Coco Rico soda to drink. This is a coconut flavored soda that I really like. I can't speak to the authenticity of the food as I am not an expert on Puerto Rican food but I can say it's delicious and I'll definitely be back!

Went here with my daughter and used a Groupon that I had purchased. We went right at 5:00 and sat out on the patio. I liked the atmosphere and the Long Island Iced tea I ordered was pretty good. (For those of you that know me - I am very picky about my LIT!) I am not going to be able to give you the exact names of what we ate since the menu online is not the same menu that we had but I will try and remember what I can! We started off with an appetizer made of acorn squash and it was amazing! That and the dessert were both of our favorites. For our entrees we ordered the Salsiccia sausage pizza (with goat cheese added) and an entree made of ricotta dumplings and braised beef (Gnudi?). Both were pretty good. The desserts again were amazing. Our favorite was the Pumpkin Budino. Absolutely delicious! I was also very impressed with our server because he was spot on with all of his recommendations!

I don't have anything bad to say about my recent stay here. I arrived on Wednesday and left on Sunday and all of the staff were very nice and attentive. My room was great as were all of my meals in the restaurant.  And the cookies rock that they give you when checking in!

Came for AZ Restaurant Week with 3 friends. I agree with another reviewer about how it is a little disconcerting to come in from the south side. I wasn't sure I was in the right place at first and whether I should open the door or not. But I did get in and since I arrived early I ordered a drink at the bar. The bar seems fully stocked (although they don't carry coconut vodka) and I just ordered a standard Long Island iced tea. It was fine. I wasn't offered a glass of water with it however and had to ask for one. Although we were planning on ordering off of the Arizona restaurant week menu we also wanted to sample a couple of their regular appetizers. We decided to go with the brussels sprouts on a bed of sweet corn grits and the crabcakes. We all agreed afterwards just how good the brussels sprouts were. They ended up being one of our favorite dishes. The crabcakes were okay and in my opinion nothing to write home about. For my restaurant week's selections I chose the chopped salad, the scallops, and the bread pudding. I loved the chopped salad. It was like nothing that I have ever had before. I loved the couscous and the currants. Those and the pinion nuts really made the dish. The scallops were served on a bed of the sweet corn grits and they were absolutely to die for. There was four of them on the plate but I only ended up eating two as I knew that I still had dessert coming. The cola gastrique drizzled over the top was absolutely amazing and really added a lot to the taste. The buttermilk bread pudding that I selected for the dessert was exceptionally good. The blueberry compote added just the right amount of sweetness to it and the ice cream added just the right amount of velvety creaminess. One of the people I was with ordered the peach cobbler and I was able to taste hers and I have to admit that I'm glad I ordered the bread pudding. I thought it was much better than her peach cobbler. The other entrée ordered at our table was the meatloaf. It was a huge hunk of meat on a bed of risotto with mushroom ragout and although it was good, I don't think it was as good as the scallops. Service was good and our waiter, Nathan, was very nice and accommodating (as well as easy on the eyes according to my one friend!).  So in closing I would like to say we all thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and I will definitely be back with hubby!
