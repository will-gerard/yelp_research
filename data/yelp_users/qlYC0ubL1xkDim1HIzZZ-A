I have had my issue with this particular q.t....seriously thought I was gonna boycott. But shit happens and I really do have way more positive things to go off of. Them letting one bad incident hinder my entire perspective. Love this q t have gone here for years and will keep coming for years to come.

Only about taking your money. If the see an opportunity beat believe there gonna take it. They seem nice but are very non professional.  Charge you a pet fee when in fact you have no pets. If your human and make mistakes in your life...well be prepared to get evicted over the smallest of things.. (so they can keep your deposit) they give  nobody that lives here a key too by he pool area. If you get a package that gets left at the office...DON'T EXPECT THEM TO INFORM YOU.

I usually have great luck when i come to this Ross but since it is after x ma's much of the good stuff was taken. Oh well let's see if the one on happy valley has a better selection

The food here is alwYs hot and perefectly cooked.my favorite is there sausage breakfast biscuts!!! No joke there biscuts are freaking real!! No frozen oddly chewy gross biscuts. Just plan old real flaky warm biscuts. I recommend everyone try one of those breakfast sandwiches from Carl's Jr...and you will agree that it has one of the best breakfast sandwiches around. Not to mention the service was speedy friendly and accurate decent price. You will be seeing me again

Well may I first add I'm not one to bitch and mone but there is a girl that works here looks like mid to late 20's. Rudest person I have ever tried to interact with. Anytime she is working and I come in. She blatantly does not say hi back ignores any of my how's it going ANYTHING. she pissed me off so bad I now drive a mile and a half the other direction just to avoid her rank ass attitude.

I was very disappointed. ....brought in tons of clothing...walked around the store while waiting for them to look threw my things. Looking at all the brands they had, I had the same brands, and more! Items I've only wore once or not at all tags on them and what not. I looked over when I noticed her finally start looking threw my bag....she unzipped it,pushed some stuff around and stood up and called my name and said unfortunately we're not interested in any of the things you brought in today!!!!!!WTF! HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE OR NOT WHEN YOU DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO LOOK! pfft.....already had their mind made up when I walked in the door aparently......betsy Johnson purses Michael kors,guess DKNY , relic, coach,Kathy can zeeland.etc. I was so disgusted and dissapointed. Never going back to any of there "chains" cap corporation with garbage employees.
