Definitely one of my favorite places because they have great wine and yummy bruschetta! I've brought family, new friends and pretty much everyone here. We always get the bruschetta here! It's the perfect sharing plate. The live music is a plus when they have it and it's just a chill environment.

Great little place to grab lunch or Pho to go! My boyfriend and I come here often since it's not too far from our home. Definitely a place we go to weekly. We usually get the same thing every time we go and have not been disappointed. I'm hoping they add a few things to their menu...

I used to come here all the time a few years ago and then I slowly forgot about it as I got into a new relationship. We decided to pick up takeout because I was craving Mexican. Oh boy, I'm so glad because it's so good! Yes, I'm eating as I'm writing this. I remembered how I always mixed the hot salsa with the mild to get the perfect salsa and they sell pitchers of margaritas! My boyfriend enjoyed his meal, so we're definitely coming back. He even said he'll bring his friends. It's one of my favorite hole-in-the-wall joints! Oh, by the way... I'm eating the chicken fundido! :)

This is definitely one of my favorite places to go when I want to grab a meal with a old time friend of even with family members. The staff is very attentive and the food is great! My favorite - the creamy garlic chicken pasta. And to top of the meal (even if I am beyond stuffed!) - zeppoli. It's definitely a dessert you gotta share because it's more than enough. Mmmm...

Saw them at the farmer's market at Roadrunner's Park and my boyfriend was eyeing up the garlic cheese bread. I walked up and added 2 of the spinach cheese pastries. Just ate one this morning after warming it up in the oven for a bit and boy was it delicious! I have a pot of chili cooking up for Sunday football right now and we can't wait to try the garlic cheese bread with it. Definitely will have to try more the next time we go to the market. Maybe check out the physical store...

This is where my boyfriend and I go for teppanyaki now when we crave some great food and entertainment. We've been going and now request for the chef Jaime because he is hilarious and mainly one of the reasons we go back. All the teppanyaki places do the same tricks but Jaime has a great sense of humor. Not one for kids tho... But he will tone it down if there are children present. The servers on the other hand, are usually slow and are rarely available.

I'm not sure why it took me so long to write a review for this place. My boyfriend and I absolutely love it! It is a hidden gem in the area. We tend to order takeout more than eat there because we're usually in sweatpants and tired, but the food is just as good by the time we get it home. I love getting the potato cakes - it's a guilty pleasure of mine. We also share an entree because there is so much food in each order! It's definitely one of the places we go to at least 2 times a month. So it's in our rotation of places to go when I'm too tired to cook.

When it comes to a bad experience, I try to wait a day before giving a review.   I was definitely disappointed with this establishment. My boyfriend and I decided to try this restaurant out for our anniversary dinner and made a reservation earlier in the day. The person that took our phone call even asked if it was for a special occasion and we told her we were celebrating our anniversary.   We get to the restaurant and asked the hostess if it was alright for us to purchase some drinks at the bar and then sit for our dinner. She said it wouldn't be a problem at all so we decided to wander around the resort with drinks in hand. About 15 minutes later, we came back to the hostess stand to find a new hostess. She walked us to our table and we were greeted by our server. He wasn't exactly very friendly or warm. We ask him a few questions about the menu and then decided to take a few minutes to look it over. About ten minutes go by before we see him again.  We both ordered the filet. A side of the mushrooms, crab cakes, potato gratin and a few sauces. The meal also came with complimentary popovers and a taste of some sort of liver pate. The only thing I was impressed with was the popovers. Nothing else stood out. The service was mediocre. Our server checked on us when the food arrived and after we had a few bites. When I said he wasn't very warm or friendly, I really meant to say he had a cold demeanor. I understand that you didn't expect to take this career path at the age of 45 or whatever but you could at least try to smile.   Do not order the mushrooms. The crab cakes were edible - they tried to create a southwestern version that ultimately failed. The potato gratin - nothing special. I could have bought frozen potato gratin from Costco that would have been ten times better.   How was the dessert? I wouldn't know and that is pretty upsetting because I have the biggest sweet tooth. Our server never brought it up after we had our leftover steak boxed up. I wanted dessert but felt that it would be a burden to have him take my order so we just gave up on this place, paid our tab and left. It was the most disappointed I have ever been with a steakhouse. I'm not sure if I will give it another try. Spending $200+ on a disappointing meal is not very attractive. It was our anniversary on top of it all. We should have just gone to Ocean Club like we originally planned. This is what we get for trying out a new place that had decent reviews.   I think I would have less negative feelings if the staff recognized that it was also our anniversary. I mean, why bother asking when we made the reservation when no one would acknowledge it when we were there.   I'm giving this place two stars instead of one only because I enjoyed the popovers and the steak was okay. Second chance? I'm really not sure.

My boyfriend and I were craving some gyro the other night and wanted to order some takeout and just hangout at home. I ordered the gyro plate and he ordered the gyro pita with fries. We will definitely be coming back for more takeout! I also ordered a baklava roll because it striked my curiosity... I've never seen baklava in a roll before. My boyfriend is half Greek and he gave this place a thumbs up! He also likes the steak fries and how the gyro meat is sliced.   The location is tucked away in a corner on the NW corner or Shea and 32nd St. It seems to be a mom and pop shop and I asked how long they have been in business - 9 years! ...and I'm just now trying this place out. It's a very quiet place and there weren't many customers when we got there but definitely a decent place.

Let's start with the fact that I'm a fan of Apple. I have a MacBook, iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple TV. I currently have an iPhone 6.   I made an appointment for the Genius Bar a few days ago to get my phone looked at because I did not want to send my phone in for repair and not have one for a few days. Made an appointment for 4:30 p.m. so that if it took an hour, I would still make it in time for class. I even arranged to leave work early.   I walked through the doors at the store at 4:24 and waited in a line for 8-9 minutes so that a guy with a green iPad could sign me in. He tells me to wait at the end of the Genius bar, and from there, another 5-7 minutes before anyone greets me. When an associate introduced himself, he seemed pretty busy. He was also helping two other woman troubleshoot their products next to me. After running the diagnostics, he tells me there is an issue with the display and that it would take 30 minutes for the repair. He tells me to return around 5:15 p.m. Totally fine - still enough time for me to make it to my 6:00 class.   So I wander around Scottsdale Quarter and return at 5:10 p.m. to check in again (which I had to wait in line for - again). The gentleman tells me it will be another 5 minutes for calibration before it will be ready, which is totally understandable... I was 5 minutes early. So I check out some iWatches and other products for exactly 5 minutes and walk back to that guy. He tells me that it is about ready and told me to sit at a table near the end of the Genius bar. I make it to the table and wait...wait...wait for exactly 15 minutes before I asked a female associate if anyone was going to help me. She checks on her laptop and says, "Oh. It looks like they don't know you are here." Umm... what? She then tells me someone will be with me shortly.   Ten more minutes go by before someone comes out to greet me. (By the way, I am keeping track of time with all their electronics in the store if you are curious). This guy tells me that they couldn't figure out my phone and that I am getting a new one. He also mentions that he will need 5 minutes to upload firmware and such to make sure my phone is updated. I think to myself, "I can still make it to class if I wait 5 minutes."   I tell him that I will update my iCloud settings and such when I get home. It definitely took longer than 5 minutes and was closer to 10-11 minutes. By the time we finish, I realize I wouldn't make it to class on time. Yes, I ended up with a new phone but I wasted a lot of time and time is money...

This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the valley. I grew up going to Da Vang but for some reason, I like coming to this place more. Egg rolls and banh xeo are definitely some staple appetizers to get. Every time my mom wants to get together and grab lunch, we come here. I've even introduced this place to some friends and they love it too! It gets busy around lunch time so sometimes, there's a wait for a table but people get in and get out pretty quick.

Ordered takeout from here after going to another location with a friend. Definitely as good as expected! I am so happy that there is a Thai place near home that's so delicious. My boyfriend is not a fan of Thai food so if I'm not with a friend, it's takeout. I had the pad se ew with tofu and the chicken panang. This place is definitely my go to Thai joint from now on.

Sat outside when we came and it was a lively experience. Everything was very enjoyable and I got a little carried away with the vodka soda's because I was trying to keep up with my boyfriend's family... But it doesn't change the fact that the food was good and the environment was nice.

I've been here before but never got around to posting a review. Figured I'd post something right now since I'm laying in bed like a slob. Really had the intentions to go to the gym this morning but decided to eat leftover sticky buns in bed instead.   My boyfriend and I went for AZ restaurant week and both ordered from the ARW menu. For the first course, we split the Caesar salad and the cheese course. We both wished the lettuce was chopped up but I understand it's for appearance. Instead of normal croutons, they used polenta croutons which I enjoyed but my boyfriend didn't.   For our main entrees, I went with the halibut dish that came with jasmine rice and bok choy. It was a very simple dish. I liked it but nothing about it stood out. My boyfriend ordered the center cut filet. He really liked the peppercorn sauce and it was nicely put together. I remember him saying it was a great cut of steak.   For our final courses, we decided to take them to go because we were so stuffed. We took home the strawberry shortcake and the Chocolate cake. I wish we actually looked at the description or had our server tell us about the desserts. He listed our options but never mentioned anything about them. I was expecting a fluffy light strawberry shortcake with Angel food cake. Or maybe cake-like with pound cake, but when we got home, we found out it was just a biscuit cut in half horizontally with whipped cream and strawberry puree. Not really all that great to he honest. The chocolate cake is still in our fridge but I'll dig into it later tonight. No way anyone can screw it up right? It's chocolate cake!  Service was just average, nothing really to complain about. The drinks did take quite awhile but the server apologized each time. I enjoyed it the first few times we came so it will still be on our list of places to grab dinner or brunch.

I seriously do not know why we have not been here before. We've been to Talking Stick so many times and never thought to try this place out. We are definitely coming back and bringing people next time.  It wasn't all that bad waiting in line to get our seats but just so you know, it's a fairly small spot in the casino. Well worth the wait. I ordered the Seafood Creole and my boyfriend had the Pan Roast with crab meat and shrimp. It comes with a scoop of white rice or dirty rice. We both chose dirty rice. Since we are kinda hungover and tired, we couldn't stomach all of it so we took it to go. I seriously can't wait to eat it tomorrow.   Our server Sara was awesome. The heat (spiciness) scale is from one to ten. Three is apparently medium. I went with three and my boyfriend went with six but for some odd reason, our heat levels seemed to be the same... Oh well, it was still good - glad I ordered extra rice to tone it down. I was definitely sweating though and I usually eat spicy food, so maybe they got our heat levels mixed up...?  Thanks for an awesome meal. It was more delicious than our meal last night at Orange Sky that was not worth the price. I guess at Orange Sky, we were paying for the view at dinner as well as the private area for two.

My sister and I both told our mother that we did not want to come here for lunch. There's really nothing special about this place. I'd much rather go elsewhere for dim sum. Found a hair in my tripe and there was a very small selection of dishes. The baked BBQ pork buns were tasteless and I didn't even get my favorite dim sum pastry - the egg custard tart. When we wanted to order dishes off the regular menu (due to the lack of food available for dim sum), a man who I believe is the manager walked up and told us that the kitchen did not have time to make our dishes. He said it would be at least an hour before they could cook anything for us because they were busy making dim sum. I couldn't understand how they could be busy when there was nothing coming out of the kitchen. I have to add that this guy wore a button up shirt and a tie. His tie was tucked into his shirt in between some buttons near the bottom of his shirt - so unprofessional. Then again, what was I expecting from a man who could not really speak English and offered nothing but horrible customer service....   Got a plate of roast duck and it came with a sweet and sour sauce... Never in my life have I been to a restaurant that paired sweet and sour sauce with roast duck.   We won't be back to eat here again.

Oh my goodness gracious! I have driven by this place a million times and have even seen it on Yelp but did not visit until this afternoon. I am so glad I did because I think I just found my favorite French macaron place! It is a small shop with a whiteboard listing all the flavors of their cookies and macarons. I chose six different ones: tiramisu, Bailey's, pumpkin pie, strawberries & cream, salted caramel, and some dark chocolate one. I was planning on sharing these with my boyfriend originally but I've definitely changed my mind... Plus, half of them are gone already. I ate them while I was running errands because I did not have the willpower to wait! I'll definitely be back and next time, I'll give the cookies a try. Thanks for satisfying my sweet tooth :)

Stopped by today since I was around the area and picked up some macarons. I've tried 2 other places that "specialize" in macarons and they do not live up to Aunt Abby's. I have not been disappointed with any of the flavors I've had. Today, I ordered Bailey's, some sort of sin chocolate, and a strawberries & champagne macaron. Last time, I believe I ordered 6 different flavors. I don't know the gentleman that helped me but he was really friendly! When I walked in this morning, everyone inside was really busy and it was good to hear that business is going great. I was also told that they are moving a couple doors down to a bigger location. I cannot wait to see the new place! I even tried a gluten-free cookie today and it was ahhhh-mazing! I was recommended the chocolate lava cookie and it did not disappoint. I wanted to save it until I got to work but it definitely did not make it a mile away from the bakery. Can't wait to go back and try some more macaron flavors and cookies!   I might sound crazy... But when I finally get married, I'm going to have them cater my dessert table. Yup, this place is that good. I'm actually in bed right now with a strawberries & champagne macaron.

My boyfriend and I had went in for dinner and was not pleased at all. Instead of going to our usual spots for Mexican food like Blanco, LA Fonda Del Sol and Z'tejas, we decided to try somewhere new. I hoped that this little joint would be awesome but within 10 minutes of arriving, I lost hope. We sat, got our menus, ordered our drinks and received our drinks. 10...15 minutes later, no one had come to our table to take our order. I got up to ask who our server was. We got an apology and our new server was really nice but it did not make up for how bad the food was. I ordered the Chile relleno and it was pretty much a soggy bell pepper with cheese that was drenched with the same salsa they served with the chips. It just looked like a sad dinner. Not worth the money... Boyfriend ordered the enchiladas - no bueno. But the drinks were good! They took care of the first round of drinks to make up for forgetting us but nothing makes me want to go back. But we tried!

I could definitely say this is one of my favorite places. Not only is the food amazing, the staff is awesome! My go-to item is the beef shoulder. It makes you feel so homey and I'll be sending my boyfriend there for that when I'm sick. We've tried many items but haven't gotten to everything yet. Start with the eggplant fries and the truffled deviled eggs! They also have a tasting menu that is changed every week. I've been very pleased with that so far because I like to have a variety of things. The happy hour is great too! They serve awesome pork shoulder tacos with a fried egg inside and its my favorite. Sadly, those are only available during happy hour. But who cares! Happy hour is the best hour :)

My boyfriend and I come here pretty often and have never been disappointed. Service is always great and the food is amazing. Earlier today, we dropped in to try their brunch because I noticed a sign there last time talking about their Sunday brunch. It was definitely better to expected! We both left so full and guilty because we said we'd be better with what we eat but it was too good to resist. With family coming into town this month, we're going to try to get them to come with us for brunch. Thanks for another great meal!

I've been to the old location and loved it. When I saw that it was opening up a wee bit closer to my house, I was ecstatic! But that didn't last very long when I showed up and saw what the place had turned into... It's no longer a place I want to bring my friends to. It's a fast food joint now and it's quite disappointing. The last 2 times I was there, the meat and tofu was dried up and the quinoa as well... I think I would much rather go next door to Genghis Grill than eat dry Indian food that has been sitting out for who knows how long. Even the samosas were cold! I don't even want to order wine to pair my food in a plastic container... One cashier said they were going to change it up and go back to the old ways but I don't see that happening anytime soon... I'm gonna give the place one more try before I go looking for a new Indian restaurant.

Ordered takeout from the place and the food was great. We got the gyro salad, a side of falafel and also the gyro plate! Definitely will be coming back for more! Have been wanting to find a good mom and pops Mediterranean place nearby and this is it! Decent prices for a good amounts of food!

Great pizza, service and desserts! Probably the best tiramisu I've had in Arizona... We went there 3 times the month we discovered the place and each time, I ordered the tiramisu. I'll have to try something else next time. The arancini is yummy too! No complaints.

I've been wanting to come here forever and finally convinced my boyfriend to. After today's lunch, we are definitely fans. I got the Dungeness crab with the trifecta sauce (mild) and he got the king crab legs with trifecta (medium). We also got some of the oysters and Cajun fries. I am stuffed...  It's a very casual atmosphere and located in a strip mall with Sprouts. The service was great and while our server did not talk much, we ended up meeting another server (I believe his name was Matt) who was super friendly and is an Eagles fan. My boyfriend is from Philly and a die hard fan. The next time we are here, we are probably going to ask to sit in his section. As we left, he yelled out E-A-G-L-E-S! And of course my boyfriend followed with EAGLES!   Anyway, try out this place! Be prepared to get some very messy hands, plastic silverware and some really good seafood boil!

Boy is it hot outside... We heard good things about the burgers here so we decided to venture outside of our Sunday safe zone of restaurants and tried out this place. I understand that it's an open area next to Maya but it was quite warm sitting at the bar. You'd think there would be a fan of some sort available to keep guests cool. I was sweating the whole time I was here. We came with a Groupon for 2 burgers, 2 shakes and a side. Our burgers were good but nothing memorable. The fries we ordered were so bland... It seemed like they sprinkled paprika on just for presentation and nothing else. There were exactly 11 people at the bar. My boyfriend ordered a Bloody Mary when we first got here and when he finished it, it took quite a long time before he was asked if he would like another drink. The bartender walked by a few times without asking a thing. I had the bottomless mimosas for $15. Not too bad... It's kinda what every place in old town does. We are still waiting on our milkshakes. Asked for them for them to be taken to go and it's been at least 10 minutes. It's kind of awkward sitting here waiting for them after paying and all already. We'll see if those are any good. Honestly though, I don't think we'll be back. Nothing stands out and service was just okay. There are plenty of other joints in old town to try out.

I'm not sure why I haven't written a review for this place yet even though it is one of my favorite restaurants. My boyfriend and a few of our friends absolutely love the bruschetta board and the sweet & spicy margaritas. We had gone hiking prior to visiting today and drinking did not sound like a good idea because I felt dehydrated. Anyway, our main go-to's for the bruschetta are the ones that include: mascarpone, burrata, and goat cheese. The one with mascarpone, walnuts, fig and arugula is my absolute favorite. It is almost like a dessert!   I'm a big fan of crab cakes and this place knows what they are doing with it! Also, they just started serving brunch and we tried the Eggs in Purgatory this afternoon - So delicious! We would definitely order it again! It was such a comforting dish and it would be perfect for anyone with a hangover. Maybe we will go again tomorrow :)  Anyway, we left an envelope there during our visit and didn't realize it until a few hours later. The manager, Richard, was SO HELPFUL. He definitely provided outstanding customer service. I can't believe how far he went to find us that envelope. He went through surveillance footage and went dumpster diving for us. Who does that??? Well, Richard did that and we are so thankful. The oysters are good, the grilled cheese board is yummy, and I really enjoy the tri-tip sandwich. I heard the owner of this place is also the owner of Grassroots, which is in the same shopping center. We frequent there for lobster bisque on Fridays and I love getting the farmer's chop salad with salmon at Grassroots.   My boyfriend and I went to dinner at a steakhouse to celebrate our anniversary tonight. Unfortunately, we did not really enjoy our meal tonight at BLT Steak. We left early and just came back home to relax after a long day. I don't know why we didn't think to just come back to Twisted Grove tonight for our special evening. We screwed up. We would have had a much better meal and better time.   Long story short, I recommend Twisted Grove to anyone. The GM Richard went above and beyond for us and we definitely appreciated it. We are more than happy with this place.   Now go get yourself a Sweet & Spicy margarita.

Oh my goodness gracious. I feel like I'm in a food coma right now... Just left this establishment and I am wishing I had a bigger stomach. It took us so long to decide on what to order because so many items sounded so good. I ended up with the lump crab cake eggs benedict that was no joke. There was plenty of crab meat!   I am laughing as I compose this review because I told my boyfriend the eggs were poached perfectly and the table next to us heard me say that. They said, "Did I just hear you say the eggs were poached perfectly?" Turns out, it was the owner and the chef sitting next to us but we didn't know that until we got a complimentary cinnamon sugar donut dessert with a vanilla creme sauce at the end of our meal. I was so full but my sweet tooth could not resist the donuts that were laid upon a Nutella spread and the sauce complimented it so well.   Brian started with a bloody mary from the bar instead of going to the DIY bloody mary bar - big mistake. He missed out on the fun of making one himself and there were so many toppings. Not your typical bloody mary bar. The toppings looked amazing and I think I saw oysters. If you're not a bloody mary fan, this place might make you one.   For his meal, he got the fried chicken eggs benedict and it was scrumptious. Definitely a lot of food and probably full of calories but it's worth it. Typical eggs benedicts come with an English muffin but they used biscuits and it paired nicely. He wanted the chilaquilies (not sure if I spelled it correctly) at first but it is another reason to go back to this restaurant. Everyone seemed to be ordering this dish.   For a refreshing drink, Brian ordered the pineapple mojito. I'm not sure if there was a certain name for the cocktail but if you are sitting on the patio, it seems like it would be perfect for a warm day. We are so happy we found this place and I am happy I got Brian to try out a new place. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu and we will bring friends and family. The staff was very knowledgeable in the menu and really friendly. I can't remember the hostess' name but she was super nice and gave us a warm welcome and goodbye.   We also heard that they are bringing in a DJ for the weekend. I have a feeling this place is going to be the hip, classy breakfast joint in central Scottsdale.   Great job and thank you Christina and Joe!

Came here with a friend for Sunday brunch and it was a 30-45 minute wait for the two of us. The menu is pretty creative and we decided to share two dishes. We ordered the pancake flight with the sweet potato pancake, pumpkin pie pancake and the pancake of the day (tiramisu). I am a huge fan of tiramisu so I shouted yes before the server could finish describing it. We also ordered the breakfast pot pie, which was a large flaky puff pastry with pot pie filling on top. Since I like my eggs runny and my friend doesn't, we ordered the eggs on the side.   The pancakes - My favorite would have to be the sweet potato pancakes. We were both disappointed by the tiramisu one... It was more like a chocolate chip pancake than anything else. The pumpkin pancake had some sort of filling in the middle and it was delightful.  The breakfast pot pie - While it was good, I probably won't order it again. I want to try some other things on the menu. I did order my boyfriend their pretzel breakfast sandwich and he said it was just okay. My friend ordered a salad to go and it looked great. Can't remember it at the moment but I would if I saw the menu.  Mimosas were yummy and decently priced. I will be back to give it another try!
