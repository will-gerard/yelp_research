Meh.  While I don't have any experience with the rental department, the sales department is needing some serious lessons in customer service.  Latest example - called to ask whether they carry an intervalometer for my camera, and was met with a 10 minute hold on the phone.. Here's the conversation after waiting 10 minutes:  (Note - I found an intervalometer online for $39 bucks):  Sales guy: bla bla 99 dollars  Me: Okay, thanks.  I think I will keep shopping around.  Sales guy: *click*!  Seriously?  I won't be coming back to these guys, simply because they are pretentious jerks!

Coffee - cheaper and better than the competition.  Americano is my go-to.  Food - I've only had the club on sourdough(!) and chocolate chip cookies - both are excellent.  Atmosphere - nice.  Couches inside and a great patio overlooking the farms at Agritopia.  This is my favorite coffee shop in the east valley - hands down.

The barista held nothing back in describing the flavor characteristics of their roasted beans, and helped me pick out the perfect coffee for me, it being my first time in the shop.  I eventually settled on the 24-hour cold brew coffee, which is amazing, an I'm looking forward to trying their other flavors.    Big pluses are the friendly barista, atmosphere, and quality.  I'll definitely be coming back Macbook in hand to spend some more quality time here.  Maybe I'll be lucky enough to find some people to play chess with or make interesting conversation.

I've visited this place three times now, and I have to say the service and experience have been exceptional every time.  The barista, Josh, is always happy to exchange pleasantries or engage in deeper subject matter - the last time I was in line, I noticed he had been able to extract the previous patron's area of professional interest and started a conversation . . . it's nice to see that sense of connectedness between a business and the surrounding community because it's become so rare these days.  Also, Josh (the only barista I've encountered there) was there to only lightly toast my bagel since I was 'in a hurry' and needed to get to a meeting - these people actually care about you.  Last thing - I've encountered some other (seemingly) frequenters to this establishment and they seem like great people.  I look forward to playing some chess with them just as soon as I can come up for some air from the school/work combo.  This place deserves to do well!  Definitely choose to drop in and say hi when you're in the area.

First time here and I have to say the food was excellent!  Would definitely recommend to anyone who is a fan of Thai.  I had the spicy basil with chicken, and it was among the best I've had in the valley.
