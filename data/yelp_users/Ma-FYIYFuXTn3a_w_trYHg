Ugh. My least favorite airport.   I don't understand how you can be so massive and the walk between some gates is a legit work out yet you only have a dozen seats at each gate. How does that work? You make me walk a mile and then stand for an hour because there isn't even room to sit on the ground. Could really benefit from having a tram similar to the one at the Minneapolis airport.  Also, the terminal layout is so expansive and multi layered that it can often be difficult to find people you're picking up. Forunately, the system of roads and highways here is very rarely congested.  The food choices are decent if you don't mind all the walking.  Terminal 2 is by far the least comfortable.

Seriously everything about this place is perfect other than it's closed for the summer. I will eagerly be counting down the days until it opens again in September. Great place for groups and kids and dogs! I loved the breakfast burrito I got. They mixed some type of beans with the eggs to create this eggy-beany deliciousness. I got some apricot preserves and a butternut squash creme brulee to take home and they didn't even survive one day before I devoured them.

Hard to find the trail heads but beautiful views and well-maintained trails when you do.

Equipment is probably the most outdated of all the LA Fitnesses in Phoenix which is odd given the area. The staff is either non-existent or fairly rude, although the female janitor is quite polite. There's rarely someone at the front desk. They call nearly every day about personal training which is annoying as hell since I already told them I wasn't interested. They gave me a great big hassle when I tried to get a guest pass for my brother visiting out-of-state. I had to demand a manager and ask to cancel my membership before they were even remotely helpful. If my job didn't have me all over the city, I probably wouldn't have gotten a membership with LA Fitness but this location is the worst of all the locations I go to.

Got the "Award Winning Gyro Platter" but I liked my boyfriend's "Caprese Chicken Pita" better. The garlic hummus had a little spicy kick to it which made me a bit sad (I don't dig spicy). Love that they served the pita warm. The service was awesome, even the bus boy checked on us and refilled our pita dish almost as soon as we cleared it. The fries with the pita were cold but they brought us out fresh ones. The outdoor seating was very comfortable even in the heat.

Nice, big, clean pool. The waitress were kind of few and far between. The massage therapist walking around, think her name was Jatae, was AMAZING. Incredible massage and super personable. Would go back just for her.

My favorite Phoenix dog park thus far. Super big, lots of shade, couple different terrains, always a lot of dogs there.  The only con is the grass/turf sheds all over the dogs and they leave filthy in grass bits. Other than that, awesome park.

The water fountain doesn't work. So many flies it's nearly biblical. I expected a lot more dogs since it was near the university but was disappointed. The dogs were nice but no one seemed to picking up their poop. :-(

One of my favorite stops in Charlotte. The decor/ambiance is absolutely perfect. The food, suburb. I wasn't a big fan of lavender lemonade, it wasn't particularly lavender or lemony. The macroons were perfection, however.

The absolute worst pharmacy. Pretty sure most of the employees there are dipping into the supply. They ALWAYS, without fail, manage to screw up my prescriptions and/or delay them massively. I've always used the Walmart pharmacies because of the discounts on certain medications but this pharmacy is so problematic I'm switching. One time I called in to see why I prescription I dropped off 3 days earlier hadn't been filled and they claimed I have picked it up 2 weeks prior and was all out of refills and then condescendingly lectured me that I shouldn't be out yet. When I explained that wasn't possible and asked to speak to a supervisor, they hung up on me. Also, never wait in store for your prescription; 30 minutes translates to a minimum 24 hour wait. Ugh, I hate this place.

My favorite restaurant EVER. Best piece of pork I've ever eaten and amazing service. My boyfriend takes me here whenever he wants to butter me up :-)

The nicest strip club in Phoenix BY FAR. Yes, they're sticklers about the dress code and not letting people in who are clearly fucked up/reek of weed, but that's probably how it stays a nice club. The girls are gorgeous and I haven't dealt with a bitchy one yet. Strong drinks. Great food (for real). Love coming here with a group of friends because it's a large club.

My favorite place to take people for tacos. Great vegetarian options as well as great variety of traditional and contemporary Mexican food. It's small inside but the service is quick.

Way too salty. Seriously, even the bread was too salty. The scallop dish was creative but the salt levels ruined it. Super expensive given the very small portions and few ingredients.  The service was slow and unattentive. Saw our waitress only twice. The hostess texted that our table was ready but had no idea what table it was and kept us waiting at the counter another 10 minutes to figure it out.   The drinks were good. I liked the pink drink.

Came again on a weekend (Saturday) and I will not be coming back. The service was horrible. The hostess could not estimate a wait time to save her life and didn't say more than 3 words to us. The server couldn't remember our order although he was writing it down and then didn't bring us our appetizer or drinks. We pointed this out when he brought our burgers, he seemed annoyed at us and didn't apologize. He brought us our check mid-way through the meal (I kinda wanted dessert) and disappeared. Also, is it a rule that none of the people that work here are allowed to smile? The burgers are good, but not good enough for me deal with the poor service. :-(

This place is awesome and the stylists are fantastic. Tarah got my hair a HEALTHY pastel pink after 3 hair stylists told me it was impossible.   I cannot recommend Tarah enough. She has awesome skills and she's a blast to talk to. The other stylists are funny and sweet as well. Also, ice cream next door. You can't really beat getting to eat ice cream while your color sets.

Great seats and food options. Never all that crowded. Wish they had more options/variety with their showings; they'll often have the same movie on more than one screen.   The food counter people are absurdly slow and get confused easily when basic requests like "fill the popcorn bag only halfway."

Wading through a lot crap with not much to show for it. Also, unrealistic prices ($15 for a Forever 21 tank top with a hole in it, really?!). No one working acknowledged me the whole hour I was in there even though it was pretty empty.

AWFUL. Absolutely awful. The staff here is outright rude and don't bother with drive-thru unless you want to keep your car running for 20 minutes while they ignore you. I've been here 3 times and every time they've taken excessively long to prepare my order and STILL got my order incorrect. When confronted, they argued about it. Seriously, drive the 2 blocks down the road to the other drive-thru Mexican place and save yourself the headache.

THIS PLACE IS AWESOME. I heard they might be getting rid of free-play which would dimish it's allure but maybe they'll do penny games? Fingers crossed. They have some really great nerdy drinks on both name and contents (Princess Peach was super good and they used surge soda in my friend's drink which kinda blew my mind). The decor/environment is also awesome although they could use more seating.
