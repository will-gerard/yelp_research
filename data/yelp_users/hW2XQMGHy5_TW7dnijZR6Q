Let's talk about the good things at Moto.  1. Beer. The owner (who splits his time between CO and AZ) doesn't mess around with "typical" beers. You won't find Budweiser, Miller, Coors, Heineken, Corona or any of their "lite" varieties. Usual beers found on tap are from Four Peaks (local brewery), Stone Brewing (San Diego), Avery Brewing (Boulder, CO) and various other craft brewing companies.   Along with the beer comes an in-frequent "beer celebration" held at Moto. This happens for Stone Brewing Anniversaries along with other random events. Usually advertised on tables a few weeks prior to the event.    2. Non-sushi menu items. There is a good selection of pre-made bowls along with a make your own bowl option. I consider all of these bowls to be "to-go" options, I can never finish a full bowl (I'm 6'3" and 200+ lbs, to give you an idea of my size/appetite). Also, the buffalo burger and salmon entrees are good sized and won't break the bank.  I've had every appetizer available on the menu and can say that they are all good to excellent. The spring rolls come with a wonderful sweet sauce. The chicken quesadillas are large and filling. The asian nachos are piled high.   3. Desert - The "Mojos" are probably one of the best frozen deserts I've ever had. Ice cream wrapped in rice crispy treats. The ice cream can change daily, the servers usually do not know what flavor it will be. The menu states this as well.   4. The "Underground" menu. This is the menu of specialty rolls that are made. These clock in at $12 each and are very good. The Jalapenko is spicy and very filling for an 8 piece serving.    5. The "all you can eat" on Saturday. This is both good and bad. The good is that yes, you can get all you can eat (of the available sushi, not everything is on this special). The bad is that once it gets busy you will need to wait for your items, Moto runs two sushi chefs max. If you expect 20 orders of 5+ sushi items to come out in 5-10 minutes, you need to come back to reality. Get there early and order in a timely manner, be prepared.   And now the downside:  1. Sushi - The regular menu has, in comparison to other sushi bars, a very small selection. As mentioned in earlier reviews, only smoked salmon for some items rather than regular salmon. The sushi available is of good size without the "rice bloat" that some sushi bars have, you know what I mean, when the roll has more rice than contents (fish/veggies/seaweed or soy wrap). I recommend ordering a regular roll, such as spicy tuna and an "underground" roll (mentioned above).   2. Wait time and servers - This is a neighborhood restaurant, through and through this is how the owner markets the establishment and runs it. If it is very busy you will need to wait for a table. You will need to wait for your order to be prepared longer if it is busy.    That's all I have to offer you in the way of advice and opinion on Moto. Overall it is above average when factoring in the experience and goal of the restaurant. I wouldn't call it a "sushi experience", but rather a nice sushi restaurant in a good neighborhood. Go to have a nice lunch or dinner, or to watch a game and drink some great beers.

The ol' D and D. A quiet and lovely sandwich shop/bar in an otherwise boring shopping ce of Central Phoenix.  Each time I come here after work it is slow and the service is excellent. The bar is usually staffed by older employees while the sandwich counter has younger but still very nice employees crafting tasty eats.  The jalapeno havarti cheese is absolutely wonderful on a sonoran chicken salad sandwich. I believe the best reviews of this restaurant probably have taken full advantage of the customizable menu options. It does boost the price of the average sandwich up though. I almost always get pine nuts and pepperoncinis in addition to the standard options and the sandwich ends up being 9 dollars or so. A bit pricey but completely worth it.  As mentioned in numerous other reviews there are multiple seating options. An outdoor patio, tables next to the wines and bar area, tables at the east end of the lower floor and upstairs which are accessed via staircase at the east side of the sandwich/grocery area.  There is a great selection of deli meats and cheeses at the west end of the sandwich counter. A very respectable selection of tea, coffee and other local goods. Including hot sauces, coffee cups and various small gifts.  Great place to hang out on a Friday after work and listen to some live music while drinking a craft beer and enjoying their patio with a fire place.  A note to those parking here. The spots for customers is between the office building and the parking structure just south of the building.

Review #83 and nothing surprising to report here.   Parking is still rough, but if you know what you're getting into then you park a little bit down the street and hoof it up to the corner.  Bruschetta is still amazing. If you have a group of 3+ get two orders and a big mix of them so everyone can try something new.   I come for wine lunches because the 5 dollar glasses are great. The beer list was also surprisingly good the last time I visited (Late Nov 2008). Including some great imports and domestic craft beers.  I usually stick with a salad or a sandwich for lunch and I've never been disappointed. Nothing specific to suggest, go with something that you generally like and I'm sure you won't be either.  Wait staff has always been pleasant and available when we needed them to be. I always make an effort to ask how their day is going, be friendly and engaging on the initial introduction. This usually helps ensure that they look forward to serving our group, rather than cringe at coming back.  You cannot go wrong with a lunch date here and I'd venture to say that dinner is just as good. Don't miss this gem tucked away in the east/central Phoenix area.

Tucked behind an unassuming Denny's location and right off of the 60 freeway, a slumbering testament to American sporting lurks.  Every other Thursday my friends and I descend on the Village Lanes to drink frosty beverages and be rowdy, and Village Lanes always welcomes us with open arms.  For the weary, I can confirm that the lanes are clean, sufficiently oiled and staffed by a crew of mostly hospitable individuals. Sometimes the bartender is a little too friendly with my gal pals, but he's gotta hustle those tips somehow I suppose. Sometimes, but not always, there is someone who walks around to the lanes to check on patrons. You can order beer from this employee (and should tip!), making the sometimes long wait at the bar a long forgotten bad dream. Plus you won't make your friends wait while you're belly up to a less than expedient bar.  As you would expect there is a snack bar that serves all manner of oil dipped products to satisfy your deep fried cravings. From second accounts the food served is average for bowling lanes, things are prepared as ordered but there is nothing above and beyond to note. In the business of bowling food, I would say this is a positive. If only for the sheer fact that sometimes food at bowling lanes is abysmal.  Games are just shy of $5 before 9pm and a fraction of that past 9pm in the realm of $1.50 or so. If interested in picking up more than one lane I would suggest arriving before 9pm as business sometimes picks up when the discount price is in effect. Shoe rentals are also just shy of $5. If going in a large group you can do separate checks for all parties that bowl. No worries on trying to use 7 different cards and a smattering of cash to settle your end of the night tab.  The restrooms have always been in good order when I've needed to *ahem* make use. No truckstop like conditions here, thankfully. The arcade appears to be in working order though I've rarely seen people putting it to use, I leave this detail ambiguous.  Hope to see you at the lanes and happy bowling! Steeeeeeeerike!

Yum! What the hell are they putting in the food/pitas here? It must be jesus-sauce or crack-sprinkles.   My best guy friend who lives a block away and I ventured over for lunch today and hotdamn, we were not prepared for what we had.  As soon as we walk in we look over to our right and see a massive, sexy, salad topped with beef, feta, veggies and peppers. I think our simultaneous heart-flutters could be heard, as the couple looked up at us and smiled. We were seated quickly, which surprised me given the tiny dining area and it being prime lunch rush time (12:30pm). Our hostess wasn't the most cheery, upbeat girl I've had the pleasure to be seated by, but it was quick and no nonsense so no big deal there.  Our drinks came out quick and we didn't feel over pressured due to our indecisiveness, our server was very polite while checking every 4-5 minutes to see if we'd made our selections. It took us a few checkups but we made our decisions and we eagerly anticipated the coming fury of gyro and beef via pita and salad. Our meals came out quite quickly (around 7-8 minutes) and we were not disappointed.   The fries I received with my Gyro Picado Pita were the thin oil fried type and with a light salting (and peppering) they were delicious. My dining mate's salad looked great as he picked pita pieces and went to town with gusto. No complaints from his side of the table. Also, we had several refills on drinks that were quick and did not interrupt our feast.  My pita sat for a few minutes while I chowed my fries down, as I like to savor them hot, and I immediately regretted not delving into the gyro sooner. I probably didn't even need my tzatziki as the peppers, jalapenos and gyro meat were all perfectly tasteful. I usually try to keep my portions smaller, but there was absolutely no chance of that happening, I took down the pita in probably a minute and a half flat.  We got a box for leftover salad. Check came out quick and was returned quick. All in all, a great experience. Quick, filling, delicious and well priced.

Whisky shots, PBR and Punk Rock. A sure recipe for a good time at TT Roadhouse.  My roommate loves to come here and has got me going somewhat more often, never a dull moment.  Drink specials vary throughout the week. Bathroom (Mens) is small, don't come here for #2, sirs. Jukebox is still awesome. Bartenders are friendly and generally no-nonsense, which is appreciated. Patio is small but well appointed. High tops and rails around the edges for drinks.  If the parking lot in back is full, which can happen easily, then just park across the street. I've never had an issue with parking there.

Honesty. This is what has kept me coming to Scottsdale's Car Repair Company for the past 3 years.  I own a late 90s Japanese passenger car, so I'm not a frequent visitor of the shop. Every time I do need work or want to take it somewhere I feel confident in the labor, I come on back.  Turn around time is very good, an oil change will usually take around half an hour and is moderately priced. They have won numerous awards for excellence which are displayed in the office.  The staff is accommodating and pleasant. The owner is usually present in the shop as well. If there is extra work that might need to be performed while your vehicle is being serviced they will contact you before the work is done or parts are ordered to verify you want the work completed.  They offer a shuttle service for major work (read: not oil changes), which is great if you can't talk someone into driving you around. And if you do have to wait there are a few restaurants around the area you can walk to and relax at. (if you're adventurous you can walk about two blocks west to TT Roadhouse for a drink)  Overall the shop is clean, the service is timely and the price is reasonable. If you're looking for a car shop in the south Scottsdale area, look no further.

What to add that hasn't been said in the past 113 reviews of this Tempe favorite brewery? Not much, to be honest:  No other beer is served besides what is brewed at the location. Asking for a non-Four Peaks beer will most likely be met with a roll of the eyes. (standard brewery stuff here folks)  Happy hour is 4pm-7pm with a reverse happy hour from 10pm-close. Beers are $3 during happy hour with pitchers running $11.  After 11pm there is only a "late night" menu which consists of most appetizers and a few simple pizzas, kitchen closes at 1am. I personally like the pretzels which are large and come with tasty brown mustard for dipping.  The "bar food" is above average as stated in many reviews; food usually comes quickly and is prepared as ordered. I've never experienced a bad dish in the 50+ times I have eaten here. Recommendations are: Bleu Light Burger (real bleu cheese crumbles, not dressing), the Salmon BLT and for an entrée the Kiltlifter Filet (split it for a smaller dinner of two).  Inside has a large chalk board with the current (see picture) beers and alcohol percentages. Recommendations are 8th St Ale, Kiltlifter and Hop Knot. The Sunbru is the lightest of the bunch for those seeking a higher quality light beer. Flights are available for those new to the beers offered.  Parking in the back is usually full but there are plenty of options on the nearby streets. Don't try to get away with parking in a neighboring business lot, you will be towed.  Enjoy!

Absolutely great each and every time. That's pretty much how I sum up Tricks.  Living nearby has given me good opportunities to visit Tricks for lunch and dinner, I've never been disappointed. Lunch is nice for something a bit classier that won't break the bank, their salads are fresh and crisp, the sandwiches are just enough to fill but not weigh you down (at least for me).  For those considering taking their family out for a nice quiet lunch, Tricks is a no worry choice. I've taken my family here on two separate occasions and even the picky Grandfather of the family had something he liked. (He's super hard to please) I would only steer clear on the hottest AZ summer days as the misters can only do so much. Or you could sit inside for some A/C action.  I'll agree that Tricks is a great date destination. It's the first mention when someone asks me where to go in Tempe for a nice date (with Caffe Boa just behind it). The wine list is comprehensive without being daunting and the dinner selections are borderline amazing. I've had several and again, not been disappointed. My favorite has been the Ahi Tuna Wellington, prepared perfectly and with served with nice presentation.  All in all, one of the best restaurants in Tempe and probably the Phoenix area. A few Tricks lunches in the Fall and Summer should be planned accordingly.

Shady. That's my opinion of this Shell stations tactics on selling gas to those looking for a good price.  Their curbside sign only states the 87 grade price and includes a "cash price" addition. So basically they charge a lower fee for cash and debit and a larger sum for credit purchases. The kicker being that if you use your debit card outside, to get the lower price you have to walk inside to get a refund in cash (read: change). Now while I agree that walking in 75 feet is not that bad to receive a lower price for gas, it's the whole methodology that irks me.  They are counting on you to NOT go inside for the refund. My analogy to this practice is the same as mail-in rebates. Yes, it's advertised at the lower price but in order to get the lower price you have to first pay in full and then take extra steps to get that lower price. That's why I think its shady.  Past that I have dealt with rude cashiers in this location and that's a real shame being that this is the closest Shell station to my house. The bright side is that the QT a block west has the same price without the hoops to jump through, amen.

So Casey's has been reviewed up and down on Yelp. I hope to provide some detailed information to help you get the best experience you can when coming to this neighborhood bar.  First off, there are beer specials every day. If a review states that the beer was $3.50 it was either on happy hour or was the beer of the day. Most of the beers on draft are regularly $4-$4.50. They also have a decent selection of bottled beers (and Boddington's in the can).  They have a board inside at the end of the main bar that has daily specials, this will usually consist of a higher dollar specialty item and desert along with a lower cost lunch type item. Just ask your server and they will give you the run down.  If you are in the mood for a very fast appetizer, the clams or shrimp will arrive in usually less than 5 minutes. Other apps come out as usual 10-15 minutes. Sandwiches and salads run about the same time depending on what needs to be cooked. I personally recommend the Hippy Sandwich with Blackened Chicken.  If you are looking for less of a crowd avoid Thursday-Saturday, as said before the bar is very popular and the weekend warriors come out in packs. Tuesday is a great day to come out, the special is Black and Tans but you can get either Bass or Guinness for $3.50 all day/night.   A good place to park is the alleyway behind Buffalo Exchange or the parking lot to the east of it. If it's a busy night don't even try to get in the main parking lot.  Sunday's a bartender named Tyler works the outside bar and he makes a seriously spicy Bloody Mary. He also loves to high five, don't let him down.  Hope this info helps you have a good time at this great neighborhood spot, see you at the bar.

To be a bit more helpful, I gathered up the list of beer specials and have a few more tidbits to add for your e-consumption.   Daily specials:  Monday - Newcastle  Tuesday - Black and Tan (Guinness and Bass, either together or separately)  Wednesday - Stella Artois  Thursday - Four Peaks Kiltlifter  Friday - Smithwicks  Saturday - Fat Tire  Sunday - Sierra Nevada   There are five total televisions; four in the main bar (two LCD big screens) and one small TV at the back bar. Sports is usually a safe bet, assuming there is something worthwhile/local to watch. If it's slow and nothing is interesting, ask for a channel change. Wait a minute, why are you here watching random things on TV?   The dining rooms ARE handicap accessible, you will need to speak to a staff member to have them open the back door and then go around the south side of the building to access the ramp. Handicap bathrooms are also available, again ask a staff member.   The main bar has a "classic" dartboard and a chalkboard to keep score. Ask the bartender for the darts.

On a recent whim the best friend and I decided to venture out from our familiar Tempe surroundings and head into Phoenix for some dinner. While I had heard of the Los Dos before I have never taken the time to get here until one fateful November night.  We arrived and parked up close to the door which I thought was to indicate we would have no wait, how I was mistaken! There was no obvious signs from the outside that the seating inside was so small. We put in our name and waited on the outside patio where we had some chips and salsa to wait for our names. 45 minutes later, a bowl of chips and two frosty AZ dwellers were seated inside near the kitchen entrance. Hooray!  Noted was the décor of crazy New Mexico style. An employee took our drink and appetizer order quickly and our chips/salsa and guacamole came out quickly. Besides finding pieces of the core in our guac we were beginning to be satisfied. Another different employee came to take our food order which we were ready to provide. Things were looking up until the lights went off...  Apparently the tradition here at Los Dos is to turn the lights out for a birthday customer and bring them out a flaming Hispanic dish. The problem with this was that the lights were out for about 8 minutes before anyone produced said item. So there we sat, in the dark with no clue as to what was going on. Bells clanging, people clapping and fire spouting came the traditional celebratory food. Good we thought, we can carry on now.  Then things got ugly. Well, we got our dinners first, and then we notice a slight commotion in the corner table. What I originally thought was an older disabled man who needed help getting up after his dinner was actually a heavily intoxicated older man who had *ahem* thrown up his two margaritas and his dinner onto himself and the floor. From what my companion tells me the margaritas are particularly strong here at Los Dos and so we were present to witness this older man basically incapacitated from two Margs. Paramedics are called. Hoopla commences.  We decided to bite the bullet and finish our meal and try to make the best of things. The food it turns out is very good. Tamales, tacos and chimichangas were ordered and enjoyed. Very flavorful and well made, definitely enjoyed the green sauce here. Not too hot and not too weak, just right.  Unfortunately this brings the final flaw in our night of dining. After our dinners were brought out to us, we sat, and sat and sat some more with no employees even looking at us for nearly 35 minutes. No queries for drinks, more chips, dessert, nada. I finally went up to the register and the lady handed me my check. I asked if this was the normal practice because I had never been to the restaurant before and had sat waiting for additional help/check/anything. She nodded and apologized to then blame the craziness that had gone on. While I understood, there had been only two employees helping the elderly gentleman who tossed up his dinner and neither were the ones that had helped us thus far.   Nevertheless I paid our tab and we made our way out. Full and satisfied from food but disappointed in the experience overall. Whether Los Dos will get another shot is still undecided, perhaps another location at the least.

For a chain or restaurant in general with "wing" in the name, this place really doesn't impress.  If all you're looking for is standard draft beers, mediocre wings and sports, sure it'll fit that bill but it won't stand in any discernable way.  Wings are just average sized. Selection of sauces is good, the hottest is pretty hot but not extremely flavorful. I suppose it's just there to burn you twice, you know what I'm talking about.  I won't go on promoting a bunch of local bars or chains locally that do the same thing with wings, beer and sports. Oh okay, I will; Hazelwoods, Native New Yorker, Zipps and Tweakwoods all do some/everything better than Wild Wings.

What you (might) want/need to know first:  HTCs staff is friendly, professional and extremely knowledgeable. Unless you're a jerk you will have a great time getting a hole through your body.  HTC is an APP (Association of Professional Piercers) member. One of three shops in the greater Phoenix metro area. Visit - www.safepiercing.org for more info  Now with that said I have had several piercings done at HTC on Ash with nothing but wonderful results. I also have had several friends receive piercings here, same results.  Their aftercare cards are well laid out and informative. The aftercare products they sell are highly recommended for smooth and quick healing (Satin, H2Ocean, etc).  I do not have a negative thing to say. They are great and I will continue to take friends/family and recommend them to random people.

I'm hooked. After google searching and then seeing the Yelp rating, I decided to stop by Boba Tea House this weekend.  The couchs are comfortable, the TVs were tuned to something decent to watch while we waited for our order and the staff was pleasant.  I ordered the Green Apple Tea and my friend had some type of fruit slush boba. Both were delicious and had perfect density boba (not too chewy, not too soft). We did not try the food, but I may go back and give it a go after reading more details about the previous reviews.  Make note that there is a $5 minimum if you plan to use your debit card and that a regular size (there are two sizes) boba is not $5+.

Let me break down the Clubhouse really simple for you.  Parking is a bitch, there is a huge office parking lot to the west (across the street) that I've never had a problem parking in.  The staff is all business, don't bring some shady looking ID (vertical AZ ID, cracked, peeling, etc) and expect to get your wristband.  If you need to use the bathroom and can get next door to The Horse and The Hound, do it. Their bathrooms are approximately 350% cleaner than The Clubhouse's.  The A/C isn't the best, so if you go to a show in the summer expect to sweat your respective nether regions off. Be ready to put your hair up, leave your pants (wear shorts) at home and hoodies in the car.  That being said, they have great bands come through. The bar is pretty decent and keeping the above caveats in mind will net you a solid experience.

Beer. Bicycles. Food. The three essentials to Boulders on Broadway:  Ride a bike and have no worry about it being stolen as you can bring it inside to their spacious bike racks. Most of the employees ride bikes as well, so feel free to strike up conversation about cycling. On that note, all of the employees are friendly and (usually) prompt on drinks/ordering/etc, when it's busy sometimes there is a delay but that's standard for most businesses. Especially neighborhood places.  Lots of tap beers (12+) and even more bottles/cans in the cooler. Fans of Stone Brewing, Dogfish Head and other distributed craft brewing brands will be pleased to see their selection. The taps and stock changed semi-frequently but not enough that you won't have something to like week to week.  There are a few bland selections on the menu and other things that are very good. I can attest to anything "Southwest" on the menu being delicious, I usually go for the Southwest Quesadilla (which you can get veggie). Their pizzas are above average, we're not talking LGO, Cibo or Bianco quality, but they are worth a shot if that's your craving. My friend likes the Pepperoni Wheels, I find them a bit oily while still being good. One item I found lacking was the "Turkey Sandwich" and the regular nacho plate didn't impress either. They were both below average but not the worst I've ever had.  They have good specials throughout the week, with my favorites being Monday (1/2 price pizza), Tuesday (1/2 price apps) and Thursday (1/2 price select bottles, one each, as to get people to drink different beers).

I was warned.  I got called out to come here by some friends on a Thursday night and the experience went as such:  Enter to be carded by a young lady at the hostess stand. Which is completely okay, I'm in my late twenties I don't mind being carded.  I make my way to my friends and am informed of karaoke and a lack of waitresses. No sweat I say, I'll hit the bar.   I visit the bar and notice the giant wall of TVs, plenty of space to sit and a patio. Good stuff so far.  The bartender cards me yet again and then gives me a wristband to prove my age. I oblige but can't help but wonder why the lady at the door didn't perform this function as well, odd.   My Kiltlifter is served in a plastic cup. Now, I work in a bar, we serve in plastic when we're at or close to max capacity. There were _maybe_ 20 customers in the building. We sometimes get rowdy, but I doubt enough to warrant plastic, so what's the deal?  The beer was as it should be, cold and foamy. We also ended up with shots, as our resident karaoke queen needed her nightly round. Interestingly enough the shots came in standard glassware.   No one ordered food, so I'll not comment on the supposed quality. I wouldn't expect much though.  The patio was visited as I chatted with a surly Scottish gentleman smoker. I definitely would like to see this patio during a nice spring/fall day. Looked great during the evening.  The restrooms were not visited on this maiden voyage, so I cannot comment on the condition. After reading the previous reviews I'm perfectly okay with that.  I'd give it another shot, but I wouldn't recommend the place to someone looking for sports, beer or karaoke even. It was par to sub-par all around. Bummer, as it's a nice building and in a great location.

Standard fare, there I pretty much summed up what you should expect from this Native New Yorker location.  That being said they do a decent job at the standard fare. The food is consistently mediocre which, in my opinion, is better than somewhere with outstanding food one trip and lousy food another time. The wings (which my co-worker orders every time) always look and taste the same. Also, they are 0.35 cents on Tuesday and Thursday. The sandwiches are fairly good. I stick with the Italian and curly fries.   This location does stand out from other Natives as they have $2 Pabst Blue Ribbon 22oz beers all the time. Quite a good deal.  They also have free UFC fights, so if you're into those types of things it might be worth a trip to not pay for it at another bar with equal amounts of average bar drinks/food.

I made a reservation on the Monday after Valentines Day, just in case there was some post rush of couples who wanted to avoid the dreaded Hallmark day dinner madness. Well, that was easy enough; a phone call and a nice gentleman got us down for 8pm sharp. We arrived to find a mostly empty, should have known for a Monday, Eddie's House. The place is looks and feels great. We were shown to our two person table which was large without being too expansive and had some really comfortable plush chairs.  Our server was a young guy by the name of Chris, he came and asked us water preference (nice touch) and then returned to take our drink orders. We each had a glass of wine, for the lady a Cab Sav by the name of Dynamite and for myself a Pinot Noir going by Row 11. Both were good and the pour was generous from the bartender.   While munching our complimentary bread basket with tasty butter side (so good), we decided to try the Tuna Tar Tar Nachos. When they arrived I was underwhelmed to say the least. There was basically 2 ounces of chopped tuna with about the same amount of avocado and very little else. The chips were very good but I expect (especially for $12) that there be enough to go around for the chips provided, simply put, there was not by a long shot.  Undeterred we ordered our entrees. The Filet and Roasted Salmon were both extremely good. The portions were about what I expected and given that we had bread, wine, tuna tar tar already there wasn't any doubt I would be full. The salmon was cooked wonderfully and fell apart upon prodding with my fork. The filet was cooked a tad bit rare but still was within the range of medium-rare, I tried two bites of it and almost wished I had ordered it instead (it had been awhile since I'd had good filet). We both finished our orders and agreed we wouldn't be able to get a desert. Chris came by and ensured we were ready and got everything out of the way and our check with casual speediness. He was really great the entire meal.  Summed up; good wine, underwhelming appetizer, great entrees, excellent service. I might not be back right away, but a return visit at some point is definitely warranted.

I met a decent sized group of people at The Mission for a Sunday brunch and it was a treat.  My friend and I each had the Chicaquiles, which were prepared wonderfully and served very promptly (hot plate!). I had a mimosa while waiting and while it was very good, with fresh squeezed orange juice, the eleven dollar setback for a single drink was a bit much. While we waited, the wait staff brought out a guacamole cart and prepared a bowl of it especially for us based on what we wanted in it. The ingredients looked very fresh and the guac was delicious.  I decided on some coffee with my breakfast and I must recommend it to anyone who enjoys a brunch with some java. Apparently (as told by our waitress) the coffee is a blend prepared for The Mission exclusively. It was definitely a highlight during the meal.  Our group ordered almost one of everything from the brunch menu and I heard no complaints about quality, quantity or freshness of what we received. I'm sure I will make another visit to this lovely establishment in the coming months, when I do, I'll be sure to update my review and add any new comments.

Why haven't I gone to Cornish Pasty Co until now? This was the question that continued to plague me as I enjoy my two dollar Jameson shot (yep, the happy hour straight shot deal isn't just well) and then followed it up with Dogfish 90 Minute IPA while I waited for my veggie Greek pasty to arrive at my table.   The location is great, very visible for those not familiar with Mesa, you literally cannot miss it on the corner of the strip mall.   They were completing two big outside benches/tables on Saturday as we arrived, so there will be room for big groups of people to relax on the patio and enjoy their food and drank.   Everything was superbly clean and well placed. The service was fast and the food was prepared quickly. The music was just right, so much so I didn't even notice what was on, it all just blended together to make a delightful experience.   Definitely will be back here for libations and/or tasty treats in the coming months. I just hope there are some misters setup outside for the coming blaze that is our summer.

Countless pasties later and I'm back for an update.  The patio had some issues so the owners (who are awesome) tore out the glass top long tables outside and added huge (seats 6+) booths with flower pots on top with cushion seats and backs.  They've added more "dessert" pasties, plus more side dishes and salads.  Sunday's now feature breakfast pasties, a bloody mary bar and mimosas.  They are doing a lot more with this location than with the original Tempe shop, which I assume is because of the added space. Whatever the reason, they are doing it right.  If you want to get the expanded Cornish Pasty Co experience, take a few extra minutes and hit the Mesa location. It WILL be worth your time.

Better than a jab in the eye, that's for sure.  In all seriousness, TMI is a great spot thus far for the busy downtown lunch crowd. I've been twice since opening, once for happy hour drinks and another for lunch. While the draft beer selection leaves something to be desired, the bottled selection is a notch above standard fare. As mentioned in previous reviews, Four Peaks is near and dear to my heart but I can throw rocks from almost any point in Phoenix and hit a pub/restaurant with their beers. At least they have Hop Knot, which most places do not have on draft.  Sampled thus far from the menu:   Chips and Salsa, of which neither are store bought, chips are thin and appropriately salted. The salsa is medium, as stated on the menu, but with a good consistency and just a hint of heat.  TMI Dip, with bits of jalapenos in a warm cheese sauce this appetizer really hits the spot. A generous amount of bread chips is given along with and the quantity went the distance of the dip, which can be a problem sometimes (I'm thinking pita and hummus, never enough pita)  2na sammy, warm tuna with tomatoes and onions on a buttery bun. I can say I was satisfied but it seemed almost... bland. I'll probably give it another shot when I've gone through other menu items.  Past what I sampled personally, I've seen the veggie sandwich, the griddled cheese (very cheesy!) and the coney. A friend called TMI's coney the best "hot dog" he's had in Phoenix. A lofty claim to be sure, but it did look excellent, maybe I'm just a sucker for mustard (which looked homemade).  Chips with pickle or mixed greens as the sides of the hour for the entrees, I've had both and found the chips to be my preference. The mixed greens could use, something, anything really to win me over. Postinos standard greens, dressing, cherry tomatoes and pine nuts aren't over the top but seem much more appealing. I can say the house dressing on the greens is great.  I've finally arrived at my negative comment, the service. I'm unfamiliar with the experience level of the servers but on both occasions my party has sat on the patio and each time the servers were sub-par. First time around we sat with empty glasses for 5-10 minutes on multiple occasions, though it was 6-7:30 and not particularly busy outside. The second encounter (lunch) was met with a server who seemed nervous and failed to correctly take my orders "quirk", I asked for the mixed greens WITH the pickle as well (on the previous trip my friend had this done without any issue). It's minor, but worth the mention as I think pickles are divine gifts from the heavens.  I'm excited to have a good lunch spot to meet friends during the week, I only hope that the draft selection gets a bit more variety and the servers shake off the opening jitters to really kick some ass.

Busy, always busy. Great food, great cocktails, great service, always great in these regards. Perfect date place with a reservation. Bar seating is first come first serve, so try for that if you go on a whim. Ask about the specials too, always something cooking in the back there.

Go on a relatively slow night on Mill Ave. Bouncer talks to girls for several minutes before letting you inside. No server or if there is one the wait is completely up in the air. Go to the bar to order a beer on draft, wait 8 minutes while the two, then one bartender completely ignores your section of the bar. Upon conversation about said beer, are told they do not have it and then immediately starts to walk away. No questions about what else I wanted, no suggestions for further beer choices, literally is five steps away after he told me they didn't have what I wanted. I'll tentatively say I won't return. They have good beers and events but the staff ruins the experience. I'm sure there are some good employees, sadly those who are not ruin the experience.
