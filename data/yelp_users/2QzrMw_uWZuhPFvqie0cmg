Went here with a friend of mine that has been here quite often in the past. I can see why he likes it. I had two soft tacos, a carne asada and a grilled chicken. They both tasted great, had fresh garnishes, and a good amount of cheese without being overwhelming like some places are. Free salsa bar with good choices, and if you're a drinker they also serve margaritas and had several varieties of beer for sale. Planning to take my daughter here in a few weeks when I'm up this way again.

I was in the area and was looking for a casual Mexican restaurant and stopped in here on a whim. Juan's is in a older building and there's nothing fancy about the place, but the food met and exceeded my expectations, in flavor, quantity and price. I had a Chile Rilleno and a Chicken Enchillda with retried beans, and it was all delicious. When I ordered the Relleno my waitress raved about how good they were, and from the first bite I understood her enthusiasm - I wished I had ordered 2 more! The salsa was good enough for me to take home some - I'm kinda tired of the diced-tomato kind, Juan's is more like a sauce, and I'm still enjoying it at home. I'll definitely keep this place in mind.

I went here last night looking for a way to kill 3 hours while waiting for some friends. I get around on crutches so I needed a little assistance, and the staff here was very friendly and more than happy to help me.  The wi-fi came right up on my iPad and I enjoyed surfing the whole time with no problems, while enjoying a Medium (24oz.) Decaf Mocha Frapp and a serving of Apple Strudel and listening to the guitarist/singer and bongo player go through a couple of sets of some widely varied and enjoyable music.  A fun evening, I'll be back here again.

I went here with 2 friends tonight for a leisurely dinner. It was the first time for all of us at this location, and the first time I've ever been to a Bill Johnson's. Two of us chose the Sirloin and Hand Breaded Chicken Fingers, and our other friend chose the Nate's Top Sirloin. They were all very good, as were the sides that we had: Steak Fries, Green Chili Macaroni and Cheese, and Green Beans with Ham. We even indulged in some desserts, and they were all great and very generous portions. Two of us loved the Rock Springs Bourbon Pecan Pie, and the other went with the Chocolate Brownie Skillet.   Chris was our waitress, and she made the whole experience a very fun and enjoyable time. She's so outgoing and friendly.  It's a shame that Kent, the manager who was on duty tonight, put a downer on our experience. Seems he doesn't know how to treat his waitstaff, and spent a lot of time firing orders at Chris and running her ragged. By the time we left, I couldn't be bothered to even acknowledge his presence. If Bill Johnson's is going to make a comeback, they need to greatly improve on who they have manage the place.  In spite of his sour vibe, we will be going back.

I dined here yesterday at noon, for the first time in quite a while. My experience was great in all respects. I tried several dishes and desserts: Steak medium rare with mushrooms and grilled onions/bell peppers, side salad w/Thousand Island, Salisbury Steak, Fried Chicken Breast (I ate Jalape√±o Slices with it), Mashed Potatoes, Green Beans, Meatloaf, Fried Shrimp, Hush Puppies, Pizza. After all that (far more than I usually eat!) I had to wait a while before a few dessert indulgences that met expectations: Chocolate Cake, Banana Pudding, Peach Cobbler.  Lucy was my server, and she was friendly, attentive and kindly. I also had some interaction with Cat, and she seemed take care of her diners with friendliness and professionalism also. One of the other servers seemed a bit stressed and abrupt but oh well.  Given that it was a Sunday at noon, the place was very busy, and there were several queued up at the Chocolate Dip, yet everyone I interacted with was friendly and all too ready to lend a hand when I needed it (I'm disabled and use a powered wheelchair at places like this).  It's disappointing when other reviewers like Miss October 7th resort to such a scathing approach to try and knock down a well-established business. Don't let her dissuade you; it's a buffet, not a luxury five-star restaurant. If you like buffets, this one's very well run, and has several items to suit anyone's taste. I used to take my wife here fairly often while she was still alive, and we always enjoyed it. I'll be back.

I had a few hours to kill and was looking for a place to check in on Golf Channel, so I picked Zipps after hearing that the Golden Wings were "to die for". They were really good - meaty, crisp and juicy, and I found the medium sauce fit the bill nicely. The staff is really nice and friendly and I never had to wait long for anything I asked for. I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied. If I'm ever out that way I won't hesitate to stop in again.

I go here quite often and it's always been a good experience, regardless of whether I go inside or hit the drive-thru. The employees are so friendly and helpful. I have yet to have a poorly made item.

I was out and about in a new area of the city and spotted Lucky Boy. I've been looking for a place like this for a long time, since it's nothing but chain restaurants in Gilbert. I really enjoyed going here, and will be back whenever I get a chance. The food was hot and delicious, with generous toppings. This place reminds of a burger stand I used to love to go to when I lived in the Chicago area (Rosie's, 103rd & Cicero), right down to drive-thru's activity switch.  I had the 1/2lb burger with grilled onions and jalapeno slices, with fries and a large coke. It was $7 and change, and worth every penny. They have plenty of other choices, including many milkshake flavors.

Great food at reasonable prices. I've had lunch here twice so far, and will definitely be back. Friendly staff, very accommodating.  Update 2/27/2010: I've been back 3 or 4 times since, and still enjoy going here.

I was there last night and had a good beef/sausage combo. Great staff, very welcoming. And they had karaoke last night, I joined in on the fun with a few songs. There were quite a few singers in the queue. I'll be back!

I just finished having lunch here and I liked everything just fine. I had the #5 combo which is a taco and an enchilada, both chicken, with a medium Tamarindo drink. Good flavor, friendly staff. If you want to get the same meal and pay an extra five bucks for a schmoozy atmosphere, go somewhere else. But I would go here again any day.

Once again, Yelp comes through for me. I hadn't had an Italian Beef/Sausage Combo for a while, and Lobby's served me up a fantastic one. I ordered mine dipped and sweet, and it was like I had been magically transported to my old neighborhood on the Southside of Chicago. A wonderfully delicious and marvelously messy piece of culinary heaven on earth. The crinkle-cut fries complimented it perfectly, and there were plenty more than I could be comfortable eating.  They hit the nail right on the head with this, and I'll definitely be back to try some of their other offerings.

I just are here and everything was fine. I had a two piece Classic Meal, all white, Extra Crispy with mashed potatoes and cole slaw. The drive thru service was quick and polite.

Once again I find myself back here at Bricks. I've been coming here for a few years now; the name has changed a few times, but the great food and service has been a delightful constant. I've had several dishes and never had a complaint about a single one. I can heartily recommend the Green Chile Burger, the Blue Cheese Steak Salad, the Wings, the Garden Grilled Cheese (great with a side salad), the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and the Chipotle BBQ Ribs - I've had them all and they've been very delicious and satisfying, every time.  With great compliments like 12 large screen TVs (various sizes),  karaoke night (Tuesdays at 8pm) and free wi-fi, Bricks is a must-visit addition to the East Valley. Come and enjoy!

Still disappointing after all these years. The service was good, but the music was lousy and the food is still waay over-priced (the Jack Ribs were good, but not that good).  For this kind of money ($90+) I'd much rather go to Red Lobster, it's much more enjoyable.

I used Discount Cab as part of the Dial-A-Ride service for those of us with disabilities and would like to give a big shout out for my driver, Brian Chambers. He was friendly, courteous and patient with me. We had great conversations all the way to my destination. I hope to ride with him again in the future.

Time for Another One-Year Boycott. I recently gave them another try and what do you know! They got my order right!  Not so tonight. Either their workers are deaf or they just don't care. Maybe both. Either way I won't be back for at least a year. Good luck staying in business with this kind of help, shmucks.

I just finished an amazing lunch here. This was my first time here and it was a little hard to find so I'll let you know it's half-way between Taco Bell and Chuck E. Cheese, along the south edge of the mall it's in.  I had the Fried Chicken Dinner with cornbread, cole slaw and sweet potatoes. The chicken breast was perfectly cooked, crispy outside and so juicy inside. The owners' experience shows in how well everything was prepared and in the way the flavors worked so well together. Even the hot sauce was a perfect compliment to the flavor of the chicken. The portion sizes were generous too. Laurita and Brad were very pleasant to talk with as I waited for my dinner to be cooked to order. Well worth the wait!

I had ordered from them four or five times previously, always delivered. Good experiences every time. Now they never pick up the phone, it just rings and rings, for a very long time. Did they go out of business? A shame, because they had menu items my other delivery place didn't.
