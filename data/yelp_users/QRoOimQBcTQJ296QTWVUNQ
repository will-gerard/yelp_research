Terrified of hair cuts for years, I decided to take my son to a barber shop. Now he looks forward to his hair cuts and asks to go all the time. Abrahigm is the best. My son refuses to see anyone else. On days that he rides his bike, they let him bring it into the store so it's not parked outside. I have taken him to low cost and high end places, and no one has ever been able to make his hair look nice. I couldn't blame them, he's got enough cowlicks to drive a professional mad, and they've all grumbled after the hour long cut. Abrahigm doesn't take long, and still gives him the hot towel and massage treatment- a place where a boy can be treated like a young man. The search has ended.

All of my Culture Pass issues were taken care of by contacting Act One directly. They have called and explained to Amanda, and hopefully all other employees of this branch, how a Culture Pass works.

Fantastic customer service! I was searching for a product that was closed out and impossible to find. They were able to find it and order me a case!

We all really enjoyed Snakes in the Library! Thank you for making fun things like this available.

Dear Ross Corporate,  In regards to the management at your store located at: 10625 N 43rd Ave Phoenix, AZ 85029 I arrived at opening (9:30) and shopped around for 50 minutes. I had a mesh umbrella stroller, a diaper bag that is only large enough to fit a diaper and two bottles, and my small purse that only fits my sunglasses and wallet. When I had finally made it over to the ladies wallets I could hear the entire conversation between the manager, who was hidden from view, and Loss Prevention. They were discussing reviews that had just taken place. As the conversation changed she said to him, "Did you see that lady with the baby? I think she stole something." There was 4 other shoppers in the store, I being the only one with a baby. This is unacceptable behavior for management of a department store. Please address Customer Service skills with this store. I do not plan on returning, but would not want anyone else to suffer such remarks from an uncouth manager.

First off,  my first job was a carhop, ON SKATES, and I am much more gracious to others in that position. It can be stressful. I'm like that from when I was a waitress too, "just be patient, she's had a hard day." What I am saying is I can completely understand how hard it can be.I feel for you. Until my tummy feels the agonizing pain of waiting 25 minutes for some food.  We watched others with larger orders receive their food. We saw couples walk up to the patio and finish before we received ours. The idea of being patient and gracious began to lose it's validity when the couple has left and the family of 4 is already grubbin' down in the table that was previously occupied by the couple that ordered after us and already ate. The carhop was nice, at least. Just in a hurry and lacked some people skills. But that's normal. I am kind of jealous that they get to wear rollerblades...   All in all, I won't be returning. Not to the Avondale location. I've never had a bad experience at any other location, as a matter of fact, it's always been a pleasant experience at every other location, even as far as Prescott (we are couriers, we drive, a lot.)

We went here the Saturday night after seeing the Fabulous Amy perform her stand up routine at Doc's Place. As soon ad we walked in at 10 until we left around 11 we were surrounded by friends, be it the staff or patrons of the bar itself. Everyone danced while the band played until close. We even got to see the owner take a dance with a tiny little old lady. To be honest, I don't have a pallet for Mexican food, until that fateful Saturday night. The food was SO GOOD. Especially the Cilantro Mousse chip dip. I will be returning soon to enjoy all that is Padre's: food, music, drinks and fun.

Hands down, best sushi. Hana is our "special treat" place.

I waited a few months before writing a review because I wanted to really know what I thought. I never met Jane before and I think she is lovely. Here are my reasons for why I would recommend her work to my mother, my friends, and strangers. 1: Time saving. I have what my husband calls the trifecta of trouble. The baby, the toddler, and the tween. All boys. All the time. I don't have time to shower, nonetheless put on makeup. 2: Cost. I spend roughly $80/year on eyebrow pencils. That includes running out to Walgreens and maybe finding one that might work because I didn't have time (see above) or the funds to order the expensive one that I know works. 3: Artistic talent is just that, talent. No matter how many YouTube videos I watched, diagrams I downloaded, or information I gleaned from my many friends who are Aestheticians or MUA's, I don't have the talent. I swear I inherited an eyebrow from each parent, and then they slowly disappeared with each kid. Trying to get them remotely close to each other and symmetric to my face was simply impossible, no matter how hard I tried. 4: Self Esteem. I wake up with better brows than Sleeping Beauty. When I was in Massage school many years ago I remember a teacher explaining the importance of facial anatomy and saying, "If you ever want to look 10 years younger, get a brow wax." Brows are that important. 5: Staying Power. Sweat, pool, drool, moving hair off my face, lick attacks... worries of the past.  Jane is an artist. Let your face be her canvas and you won't regret it. Also, tip. I was in such a hurry I forgot on my first visit and felt terrible. Her service and talents well deserve compensation beyond what she charges for them. I also want to add that I am half English and half Greek, my natural hair color is an impossible combination from random blonde and red hairs to random thick black hairs. My skin has just enough olive tone to throw off any makeup. I let Jane pick the color, which she custom mixes right there, and couldn't be happier with how my brows naturally compliment my skin and hair.

My husband said that this was the best Blackened Blue Burger he has ever had.I finished my French Dip and regretted not ordering the Philly Cheese Steak to go! The meat was perfect!   He is across the table singing to the radio and expressing his extreme gratitude for a PBR and a good burger after a long day at work. We need more places like this in more accessible areas of the valley. Friendly service, great food, specialty drinks and beer. Please come to Central Phoenix, we need you!  And the coffee's not bad, either.

When I moved to Arizona I became lactose intolerant. Luci's offers Stauss bottled milk in a jar that you have to pay a deposit for (you get your money back if you bring the bottle back.) You get to scoop the cream off the top and enjoy. I like to enjoy the entire bottle in one sitting, because it is the only milk I have been able to drink with out severe tummy trouble. Luci herself is often at the store when we visit and is one of the sweetest women I have met in my life. One time our order got messed up and she gave us free dessert and drink coupons. I used those drink coupons to discover their Green Tea smoothie thing (with soy) DELICIOUS! Since it's become a busier hot spot, you may have to wait a while before ordering your coffee or food, but it has never disappointed and is a great investment of your time. Oh, and FREE Wi-Fi. Eat your heart out Starbucks across the street.

Always great coffee! I live in the neighborhood and am so thankful to have Dutch Bros on the corner.After I had a baby, I was able to send my 10 year old on his bike to get me that coveted cup of coffee that all parents of newborns so desperately need. They know our drinks, our names, and have everything ready to go when we get there, and treat my oldest son with the same customer service they treat my husband and I with.

Thrifting about the countryside of the Sunnyslope area finding amazing deals on everything, including a gently used pair of Merrel's for $2.50 at Goodwill, makes you forget about your grumbling tummy. My husband and I are big fans of the Two Hippies Beach House on Camelback and have been meaning to try out some of the new locations. My secret desire is that the Two Hippies franchise will soon take the place of a few local McDonalds, bringing hope to the next fast food generation. When we walked into this location it was clean and friendly. There is much less kitsch on the walls than the other locations, it's more roomy inside and the menu is clear and easy to read. We strolled up to the counter and Mike asked for our order. He and my husband talked until our food came and he never ventured from being polite. Great atmosphere. Great service. Now, the food. I actually shutter and am still having a hard time with this. But, it must be written. Better than the Camelback location. I didn't even know what I was missing. I could taste every ingredient in my fish taco from the first to last bite. I could taste the fresh cabbage, the fish, the onion, the sauce. The cilantro was fresh (and I grow my own herbs at home, so that's saying a lot.) Before it all blended together. Now it all had it's own flavor perfectly matched inside a tortilla. I don't even like taco's, that's why I was so impressed with the Camelback location. But this was no taco, this was a foodgasm. Smaller portions, better quality, same fantastic service. Thank you Mike and your family for being the perfect Two Hippies owners. You will do well.

This is a great spot to stop and get a bite to eat. The $3 Gyros are pretty much amazing. We've been going there since the restaurant opened and have always had great service. The owner is the coolest guy ever. He remembers us, and greets us with a smile every time we walk in the door.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the girl who runs the cash register has added $1 to our bill the last 3 times we have been there. That is also the only reason my family and I have stopped eating there. Other than that... bring an extra dollar and enjoy great service and good food!

Awesome. I wish this shop were in Melrose, but then I'd have no reason to drive anywhere ever again.

You know when you see an old friend that you actually wished you had stayed connected with? He's here, behind the counter, smiling and taking your order. Great food! Great prices! Great people! Bring cash.

Rather than say anything negative about the food or service, I'm just going to post pics of the girls bathroom. That's it. The best part about this place is the bathroom. You decide what that says about everything else. I'll try it again sometime. Hopefully the bathroom won't be the best part.

This location (16th St 2 Hippies) is a favorite of ours for location, quantity, and Friday Fish Fry! Centrally located, in between deliveries or on our way home, we must have the Friday Special. It's got some sort of Wasabi sauce on it that will clear your sinuses, yet it's somehow not to spicy. I don't know how they did it. Every now and then we will stop by and have lunch on a different day of the week. The atmosphere is always nice, you can sit on the wrap-around patio or on the north side of the building where there are chairs in the the grass. The bathroom is always clean. The people are always friendly. I agree, it takes a while to get your order, so plan accordingly. We actually call our orders in since we have to get back on the road ASAP. Also, sometimes they mess up, don't confuse them by getting fancy with the tacos. At least check the food before you leave. They'll fix it with apologies.    We've been here at least 20 times, and it's usually pretty good. The owner stops and talks to us too. If nothing else, try the Friday Fish Fry! I'm not a Fish Fry expert, but I really like it. Crispy Wasabi Fish Fry....

This store reminds me of thrift stores when I was a kid, not the over priced ones like Goodwill. Everything is neat, but the thrill of the search is still there. Great customer service. Donations are right inside the front door.
