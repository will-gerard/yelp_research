This place is very nolstagic. It used to be two houses, then they combined them, then it became a furniture store, and still bears those marks, made apparent by the shag furniture still in the window up front. Nice touch. It's supposed to be haunted but our waitress informed us that she hasn't seen anything and says the building is settling. In the women's bathroom, you do feel like you're being watched, every step of the way. =)  We have sat in the trolley and in the booths. Bring a flashlight because it's way too dark. The menu resembles a newspaper. If you get overwhelmed by the menu, remember that you can always get spaghetti. We brought extra money just to get the Italian sodas in the Spaghetti Factory brand glasses. That way we got to keep the two glasses and have a souve. Authentic spumoni can be had here.

You don't have to be a plant nerd to enjoy this place, just a nature lover. If you come here without your camera, you'll regret it. I love the desert and I'm a native to AZ and I like coming here to see and learn about the more exotic stuff, like cape aloes, for instance.   This place really immerses you in the cultural element of AZ. (Somebody already mentioned that they have native flute players.) They have live bands here, they serve alcohol here (and it's still good for kids and fieldtrips). They serve fancy, cold coffee here. Yes, the price is steep. They have a butterfly exhibit that you pay separately for and the steep price is the reason why I think the exhibit should be included in the regular fare. I went here a couple of times when they had the Chiluly art exhibit. (Remember your camera!) They have an annual plant sale with proceeds going to conservation around the state.   This park is not as big as some have suggested. I know my way around. Don't worry about the map. It's FUN to get lost in this place. The trails are not as up and down as they are at the zoo on the other side of the hill, but rather flatter and easier for older folks. The trails are crowded in March. Try to go on a weekday.  They have botany classes you could take for an extra fee. They teach gardening. I think it would be AWESOME if again, they would include these as part of the regular fare. My beef is this - as somebody who's knowledgable in desert survival, it is really freakin' hard to find classes in such a thing. You have to search far and wide for this kind of information. I understand that people are sue happy and there's bound to be one dork in the class who's deathly allergic to palo verde seeds, but 1) that's what waivers are for 2) you don't have to try the seeds in class, just teach it. I think the DBG is one of the few places that are actually qualified to teach these types of classes and I think it would really set them apart from the other botanical gardens.   I actually spotted a cardinal here. Don't see too many in Phoenix. They welcome volunteers. I recommend this place for a date.

I must protest the rave reviews on here. The worst thing about this zoo is the price. In this depression (yes, with a small d), why does $18 per adult make sense? I know you can get free tickets at the library, but have any of you ever actually tried to get tickets at the library? They're always out. This zoo nickel and dimes your pocket. If you want to pet the sting rays (who wants to pet a sting ray?), the giraffes, if you require water or a wheelchair, they're ready with their sticky fingers. I feel sorry for the people who paid to feed the giraffes because I watched as they were hounded with instructions on what to do, where and how to do it and what not to do. It really stifles the enjoyment of feeding the giraffes. Wonder how the giraffes feel. I watched as a lady complained in front of a large crowd of people about the giraffe feeding price and the lady taking cash answered matter-of-factly that it's a non-profit zoo. This is the phrase they've been taught to say. The woman walked away, likely feeling scorned. A small salad costs $8. A bottle of water is $3. Boat rides are $12 ea. Camel rides are $12. For a Polaroid of the camel ride, it's $5.   If you purchase a $75 membership, you can come back throughout the year and receive an overrated discount on feeding the giraffes and the tram ride and the carousel for a grand total of $1-2 a ride! To clarify, I DON'T have kids. Yes, I'm complaining about the cost of TWO adults.   The cashier at the entrance is a nasty woman named Eyvonne. She must have needed a Depends change and that would explain her CRAPPY attitude. The rest of the zoo is staffed by high brow teenagers. It's too bad the animal environment doesn't soften their attitude.   This is primarily a hot weather zoo. There are no penguins or polar bears here. A lot of cages are empty and you get disappointed. I've been here a few times and have yet to see the coyotes. On the "Desert Trail", they are true to the spirit of the desert, because there's no water fountains on it.   That said, I enjoy the World Wildlife Zoo on Olive Ave. much better and would gladly drive from Mesa to Waddell to go there. You'll actually feel like you're at a zoo at WWZ because they have a much wider range of animals.

I have been here three times and I'll never go here again. I went to the drive-thru and sat and waited and waited about five minutes. Finally, I pulled up the window and finally somebody poked their head out and asked what I was doing there. I explained that nobody had taken my order at the speaker. He looked at me like I just killed somebody. He took my order and I got it quickly. I came back another time through drive-thru and whoever it was had difficulty understanding so I pulled up to the window without being able to complete the order. At the window, the person who appeared to be a manager took my order and said with a sulky attitude that "it helps if you speak up." Clearly a speaker problem, not me. The third time I had to go inside and make change for the bus. This they could handle without a problem. It seems that that's all they're capable of doing.

I've been here many times. They have the best conchas and galletas. All their desserts are made with natural ingredients, not too sugary like the American snacks. My only issue is that I wish they had more selection. There is a tiny table in the back and the aisles are crowded. You have to speak Spanish if you want anything from here. You can walk out with a bag full of galletas and authentic Mexican treats for about $3.

It's very difficult to find Victorian furniture on a budget. Ross in Ahwatukee makes that possible. I bought a bedside wicker tower for $20. HELLO? You can buy the same thing at Moore Furniture "for Less" for about $100. Even Target wouldn't sell something that nice for that cheap. One day, I saw a big inventory of Victorian tapestry chairs. They were $100. I found one that was being sold as "slightly scuffed", which meant some scratches on the leg. No big deal, but they discounted it to $50 because of that. Of course I took it. ~SCORE~

Anything with a lot of tomato sause is bland. However, all their dishes with alfredo sause are very good and creamy.   You must try the Bellini tea - that's tea with peach syrup. Mmmm.

I feel that the reviews on here are overrated. "Best falafel in town" my *ss!   First, let's talk food. I'm not new to Mediterranean food. However, this was my first attempt at eating falafel. Here it's horrible. Tasteless even with the sauce. Burnt on the edges. I have since had falafel elsewhere convinced it was good because I understand the Greeks and Hebrews eat it like popcorn and I have found places with great falafel, just not here as the other rave reviews would suggest. BUT they have great Adas soup. It was really spicy in a good way and nice and creamy. So I can't explain the falafel failure. Overpriced for what you get. I had to eat off my husband's plate to get full. They do bring OK pita bread out to you.   As far as atmosphere goes, it's lacking a bit. This place is (as somebody wrote) 2/3 market, 1/3 restaurant. They have a sign in the window that says "Allah" and "Mohammed", which I don't think is a good idea. There is definitely NOT outdoor seating as the stats indicate. The tables are the cheap fold-up kind and so are the chairs. The tables are chipped. The waiters serve in a timely manner but don't smile like they would at a chain. They do have a big screen TV that was playing a soccer game but at least the volume was low.   I can't recommend this place for a date or for families. It's just mediocre.

This location has too many tables and not enough buffet. I counted 5 counters including the drink station. Freakin' Hibachi Grill has way more selection.   Other Country Buffets are great. This one needs therapy. No chicken enchiladas here. Don't you know, Country Buffet, that's what I went there for? They had a tub of chicken tortilla soup but absolutely no soup bowls. Tortilla soup on a plate leaks into the other foods. Not good.   Oh, and they have French fries but the ketchup is nowhere to be found. And that's what I noticed about all the condiments. They aren't next to the right food.   Hubby said the pizza wasn't good. My chocolate cake was very stale. I think the chef was a Le Cordon Bleu dropout.

Half Price Books is a thrift store and gift shop rolled into one. If you ever needed a birthday or Christmas idea, they have so many things in the front that are interesting and different, not always books, but novelty items. The staff is friendly. I hope to have my new poetry book in their stores. It's a discount bookstore, like Bookman's but with a cleaner look to it. They also have a good selection of music. It's quiet. I gave it four stars only because the only thing it's missing is a coffee shop, like Tempe Library or Bookman's on Country Club.

In this economic climate, my hat (or sombrero?) goes off to Food City for keeping the prices better than anywhere else. Better than Walmart and Fry's. I go here for vegetables mostly. You can get 4 lbs of bananas for $1. I get 4-5 lbs and have a banana for breakfast each day. A head of lettuce is ridiculously priced at 50 cents. I get two and a $1 bag of pre-peeled carrots and have myself good-sized salads for a week. They sell the cheapest paper towels for .54 each. They carry Tina's Burritos at .30 each. Fry's doesn't. They have $1 crab. Just don't buy the packaged deli meats. Those are overpriced. It's clean. All employees speak English. Contrary to what people believe, they do carry white man's food, like pasta and potatoes. Somebody said the neighborhood didn't look too scary and of course, it's not scary. I live in the neighborhood and it looks poor but it's completely safe.

Wanted to explain further about the prices. I go on Friday always after getting paid so I don't know if the prices shift over the week. Anyways -   Cucumbers - 10 for $1 Potatoes - .59 / lb Cabbage - 3 heads for $1  Bell pepper - .79 Navel oranges - 7lb for $1  Suggestion: Go to the freezer aisle. Tina's burritos now come in a six pack for $2. You save .40 by getting the bulk package. I recommend getting three packs for 2 week groceries.   Our bill for 2 weeks for 2 adults comes to around $60-70.

I love that this Dunkin' Donuts has a drive-thru. I wish other Dunkin' Donuts would follow their lead. This location is very convenient for me as it's near a gas station and just off the freeway. Somebody said they had slow service here. I've never had that problem. Took my husband here for a little breakfast date. Yes, we actually set the alarm and went here around 9AM. Love the donuts and the donut prices. Love that they have coolattas and pumpkin-spiced coffee near Halloween. Love the selection of donuts. I just wish the coffee prices were a little less and that's all that's keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Love the breakfast but I think you should get two breakfast wraps for a buck, not just one. This place is staffed by responsible teenages. It's a clean location with clean bathrooms.

Look for the Nello's Pizza sign when you go here. Otherwise, you won't see it from the road.   Now, I love good Asian food and I've had all kinds. Except I'd never had Hawaiian food, so I thought I'd give it a try.   Sadly, the only good food I had was the spicy Korean BBQ wings, which came out still hot, and the guava drink from a can. Don't get the saimin bowl. It is tasteless. 0/10 on the flavor scale.   I was looking at the plate lunches of others and they look pretty bland. Maybe only come here if you enjoy a big lump of pork on your plate. It's just not for me.   The guava cake and the coconut cream cake in the fridge look really good. Didn't get to try it because I'm such a tiny person.

In two words: VARIETY and HEALTHY. This was my first time here although in the past I've walked by it loads of time. Had to stop for a bite to eat and it didn't disappoint.   Looking at the menu is overwhelming, a good thing in my book. Everything sounds so fancy and delicious. They have a decent-sized breakfast menu. The place serves a mix of American gourmet with Italian favorites but with an organic twist. They have, for example, cranberry stuffed turkey sandwiches, egg parmesan sandwiches and a nice looking kale salad. The use of "soup of the day" on the menu is redudant because they have a daily choice of 6 yummy sounding soups. The staff is friendly. The place is well lit and cozy. Noise level from the mall doesn't seem to be a problem in the morning.   So what did I order that was so great? I had the feta frittata, which looked like an egg omelette mixed with eggplant, zuchinni, bell peppers and roma tomatoes. The best part is, of course, the feta cheese... It came with a generous serving of buttered toast and papas fritas. For a drink, I ordered a chai tea, which is a tad overpriced at 3.95 for a small one.   If I talk to my parents about how good this place is, with any luck, I'll get a gift certificate for Christmas.

This place deserves more reviews. I went here several times. The most recent trip was a little date with my husband. Just to get out, you know? It's free. I only went about six months ago and they were still operating with volunteers. A docent is there to tour you. They are always informative. This is an authentic Victorian style house and I would recommend it to anyone that is an interior design student, if you're homeschooling your children, if you're trying to beat the heat of summer, if you want to go on a picnic (there is a grassy, shady area) and if you're new to Tempe. I know they used to do weddings there. They might still do weddings there and it would be very picturesque. Many years ago, I took my tabby there and snuck to the front porch to do some portraits on the rocking chair with the lacy curtains in the background. As I was taking pictures, one of the docents came out to see what was up and she was very cool with what I was doing and let me finish. The cat is dead now but I still have those nice pictures.

Where else can you buy a stony meteorite that fell to Argentina 500 years ago and was discovered by Franciscan monks for $40? That's awesome.

This place is family-owned. It's tucked in the corner of an L-shaped plaza by the Fry's. It's quiet and dark. They try to make it seem like a romantic dinner place, I understand, but the darkness doesn't hide the fact that it's an old place that probably needs renovating. Service and food taste is OK. I must give this place two stars because the cheese enchiladas gave me a small case of food poisoning. My husband had something else and he was fine. So I wonder if maybe the cheese wasn't kept at the proper temp. Thankfully, I didn't vomit. I passed it by laying down for two hours. The map Yelp provides isn't accurate. It's located on the left side further south.

Don't let the long line scare you, they're good at moving the customers through and with a friendly smile, to boot. They make fancy dogs and they're the huge diamondback dog style and thickness. They're pretty tasty. The only downside is maybe you'll pay a bit much for hello? a fancy hot dog. Their chocolate malt is this weird color of diarrhea, but again, don't let that fool you, because it's pretty cold and thick and tastes really good, but then, what's up with the off color? It's a shade you just wouldn't expect. When it's super busy, they run the risk of paper and junk on the floor but I saw an employee trying to keep up with picking it up.   On one occasion I was stranded and nearly dehydrated (bad experience with the shitty bus system) and I was forced to take shelter here. They gave me water and nobody make a kink about having to purchase something while I waited for my husband to pick me up.

Ahhhh, Kyoto Bowl. I used to live around the corner from this branch and have many fond memories of walking there. My parents have ZERO tolerance for more adventurous food. My sister is scared to death of fish (because it once had a head, I know, the terror...). My mom knew of nothing else except colonial food (chicken, mash potatoes, etc.) so when I turned old enough to work, I would walk here in my efforts to seek different food.   I learned to like California rolls, noodles and tofu here. They have hot, green tea for 75 cents. Not bad. If you want to eat healthy and don't want to pay dinner price and tip and you want simple sushi, I recommend Kyoto Bowl. The tinkling fountain makes it relaxing.

OMG! The margaritas are the size of your head. Too bad they're not legally allowed to doggycup the margaritas cause you can't finish it all.   Check out their weekday daily specials. They have 99 cent tacos.   You have to wait awhile to get in. Thankfully, the outdoor fish pond helps to mesmorize you while you wait. Parking is tight.

Not a thing ran out, everything was full and kept hot or cool accordingly. Love the selection.   Only downside is when I bit into some sweet and sour chicken and hit a bundle of gristle. That chicken needs a diet - but it's not really the restaurant's fault. It's odd that they have sweet and sour chicken but no chow mein or eggrolls to go along with it. Hmmm. Still, the variety here is nice: American pizza and whole chicken breasts and some other meats. But I really go for the small sides and they have things like pasta, mac and cheese, pinto beans, broccoli and a salad bar.   Desserts are in small proportions. They also have coffee all day long. Awesome.   My brother-in-law treated us here because we'd helped him move into his new house. Now we are trying to make it back there.

My husband and I have been going to Mr. Duskin for four years and this year we had to cut corners somewhere and we decided to try H & R Block because of their sale. We got back money this year. A lot of money. We have realized that Mr. Duskin doesn't give you the tax breaks you should get. And who knows - maybe after you leave he pockets your tax check. If you're a young looking female, he digs into your personal life and makes weird comments, like when are you having kids? why don't you make more money? Like he understands - ha! He is a creepy, squirrely guy that seems to shrink into his large chair more and more each year. He also overcharges - $150 for a joint filing. I will return to H & R Block next year.

What a RIPOFF! My husband has psoariasis and we came here to get his cream. They had to order it and it cost us $30. Way overpriced. We have since realized that we can get the same cream at our local Fry's Pharmacy for only $4 AND they always have it in stock.

If there's something that crosses your mind that you need and it can't be found at Fry's, this is a good place to go. For example, my husband likes to come here for some fake flowers for his parents' graves and there's not a Michael's craft store for at least 10 miles. We can get a bouquet here for $2.   We have wanted to get those "touch lights" for years (now they're called moon lights and are no longer sold on TV). We found one here! It was $1.50. We took it. She asked us why only one? We explained it was the only one we found. She asked us how many more we wanted and she promised that she'd get another one for us. Very attentive!  She has good costume jewelry (for kid's gifts), cheap lingerie!!!, sandals, a large utility section in the back (like bunji cords, car tail lights, clamps), cheap candles (you can go elsewhere and pay three times as much for candles), toy section and household items. It is cramped in here but that's what makes it fun to poke around.   The owner's name is Ann and her daughter works with her. They are always smiling and will actually ask you if you need help.

The ungrateful twerp who owns this place should keep in mind not everyone is fortunate in this economic climate to own their own business. That being said, he OVERCHARGES for simple things. Try getting an oil change for less than $50.   To add salt to the wound, we learned that somebody on his team, while they did the oil change, they bent a piece of metal, the coil going to the heater core (sorry, I'm not a car expert) and in so doing, sabotaged the radiator. It was only a month later, I drove the car into a more reputable place down the street, with liquid spurting from the hood as I barely managed to roll in. The mechanic there told us about the bent coil and that it must have been done on purpose and it could only have been this chop shop.   Sadly, it's not possible to put ZERO stars.

Prompt service. They *smile* too. Can't beat a $5 pizza on the go. I'm grateful their pizza doesn't drip fatty oil like a Papa John's pizza. The Italian cheesy bread is addictive. Carry out only.   The Italian cheesy bread could come down in price *just a tad*. They were experimenting with these new flavors for chicken wings. We tried the lemon pepper flavor and the wings were a bit on the cold side. Also very bland for the picture they put up on their menu. They look better than what they actually taste.

This is a good place to get FAT and POOR.   I came here for the first time in about 15 years because my mom said we could get in for free. They have actual sets from movies like Wild Wild West and the Rifleman. Good photo ops.   However, I'm not sure anybody would want to pay to get in unless you're Canadian or from back East. There's not a lot to do. By waiting an hour for a stagecoach ride I missed the gunfight. It wouldn't happen again for two hours. They have burro rides. Ugh. A children's rock climbing wall that only goes 40 feet high. Whatever.   The whole town is basically shops and restaurants. You can pay big bucks for a straw hat (yeahh!), for western toys like trains or you can go to a restaurant and pay $20 for a steak and potatoes (yee ha!) If you want ice cream, it's at least $3 and the person that takes your order barely speaks English. A burger is $6. I don't know what the admission price is for the "privilege" of going here.

For the money you spend here, the proportions are HUGE. You'll need a doggy bag. I ordered a side salad. It was as big as my head. I wanted to order Greek food, cause HELLO?, it's a Greek restaurant. However, my budget didn't allow me to order the lamb. Sooo, I ordered the next best thing. Mexican food!! Yes, they have it here too. I ordered a cheaper quesadilla so I can't comment on their Greek food, but let me say the quesadilla was really, really good. And I had to take most of it home because I was already full with the yummy salad.   Enough of the food. So from the outside, the place looks like a shabby place. The location is in a tiny plaza between a bartending adademy and a Planned Parenthood. However, when you enter, you are transported to a classy, laidback restaurant. It's packed and for good reason. And on the wall, there are local artist's pieces displayed for sale so they apparently support local artists. Very cool in my book. It's along the light rail, which is good cause the parking lot is small. Even though it's packed, the waiters are VERY organized and attentive.

My first time having Ethiopian and I can tell you that I was very pleased. I thought all the onions (because they have onions in EVERYTHING) would get my tummy upset but it went down smooth.   I assumed the lamb stew would be the best thing about my entrée (#5, 8 and 9) but the spiced red lentils were amazing. The injera takes a little getting used to but after awhile, you just can't help yourself.   Even if you order the half pot of Ethiopian coffee, share it with a friend because they bring out plenty.   My only complaint is that I'm not fat enough to really pig out.

How does this location stay open? Lines are not that long and it takes forever to get up to the front to pay. There's always issues with the printers downstairs. I've come here a few times and it's not good for my blood pressure. I went here once to get my resumé copied on their paper and my printer had skewed the printing due north a bit. The dialogue at the counter went like this:  ME: Can you move the print down?  HER: No.  ME: You can just cut and paste on a new sheet of paper using whiteout tape. Can you do that for me?  HER: No.   ME: Can you do anything?  -a customer to my right starts laughing-  I wound up using the whiteout tape myself and made copies. Then I had to wait in line 10 minutes again just to pay. I was tempted to just walk out. Other locations are way better.

*Note that the restaurant is not in the same building as their international store near Price Dr. but further west on Apache Blvd, just west of McClintock Drive.   Somewhere in the remote past, I swear that I was an Arabian. My taste buds tell me so. I dream about sitting underneath a feathery date palm as I watch my camel sup from the oasis. I think I must have been a camel driver's daughter.   But in this life, when I want to satisy my Arabic cravings, I go for the hole-in-the-wall type places and for our 6th anniversary, I tried Haji-Baba. On Sunday, today, it was very crowded. The noise level makes it hard to have a conversation across a table. I will return on a weekday for lunch.   My husband had the kafta combination. I ordered a la carte yogurt salad, falaafel, baklava (for the first time) and Arabic coffee. Mmmmm. The yogurt salad was just a little on the spicy side, not too bad and very healthy. The hummus was thick and creamy. Baklava is like a granola pastry with a crepe layer on top. I think I tasted honey and cinnamon. The Arabic coffee had just the right amount of kick.   Just a couple of quirks: They don't give you spoons unless you ask and it's impossible to eat all of the yogurt (hello?) with just a fork and the side of falaafel is supposed to come with 3 pieces and they only gave me two. Also, they're not as generous with their pita bread as other places are. We only got one piece per person. But the food is wonderful.   I gave my compliments to the cashier. I said, "aT-TaAm bikhaier", which means "the food is good" and he understood me! Yea! Very filling. Try this place.

Haji-Baba al-maTaar al-akbar.  Because my husband is good to me, he treated me to Haji-Baba again. We got there at 11:00 sharp and we were the first customers of the day. Right after we sat down is when the parking lot started to fill up. That's how you handle the customer volume.   I ordered tabooli salad, yogurt salad and falafel. I've since tried falafel elsewhere and it's still the best at Haji-Baba. They're generous with the tahini sauce.   Finally, explored the little shop to the side and there are lots of little Christmas stocking stuffers here (hint - Turkish delight for a mere $5). One of these days...

My local Fry's ditched a certain brand of kouskous that I was comfortable using. They replaced it with a brand that is $8. Too much! So I found a similar size at Haji-Baba and it's half the price of my former brand, only $2.50. I can live with that.   Also, I finally tried Turkish delight, which they stock by the front counter. When I paid my restaurant bill, I'd always sneak a glance at it. They raised the price to $7.50 a box but it's still okay. Turkish delight is gooey and reminiscent of jujubees. The taste does grow on you.

I prefer going to this location of Macayo's over the others because of the ambience. It's way different than the others and it doesn't "feel" like the other Macayo's. This one is much more festive. It has a ton of patio seating and lots of shade. The antique train outside makes it much more interesting. The parking lot, however, is right next to the light rail tracks and it's small, so parking is a little dicey. They sacrificed parking for patio seating. The prices are extremely affordable. Their food is very good. Service is always consistent. Cheap margaritas. I've never been here on a weekend. I always stop in on a weekday around noon and then it has some business people on lunch.

Fry's Electronics has so much potential. It could be my go-to place for what I need. But I am here to complain about the return policy and a product that they sell.   When you buy video software and you open it, you can't return it. I don't understand why this is. In my case, I researched a product called Video Editor 8.0. Everything seemed okay. So I bought it for $50 and tried it out at home. I originally got it for its audio capabilities. However, when it renders video, it reduces the pixelage greatly. It's not even worth selling at a store of Fry's Electronic's caliber. But they don't know this. They will not refund me. I am contacting the manufacturer right now but I don't have much hope.   DO NOT BUY VIDEO EDITOR 8.0 AND SHAME ON FRY'S ELECTRONICS FOR SELLING SUCH A CRAPPY PRODUCT. REMOVE IT FROM THE SHELF.

Wow, does somebody have a personal vendetta against the Rainforest Café or what? After seeing many negative reviews, I really must compliment them. I love them. I don't have much money in this crappy economical climate or I'd go again for my birthday. I've been here many many times.   Why do I love coming here? Partly the atmosphere. I love the animatronics. It gets loud and dark when the lightning starts but it only lasts one minute. A little more light would be good. I love the fishtanks. (On one trip, I saw a dead fish sunk at the bottom.) I've never shopped in the store part because it's all cheesy, kid's stuff. I also love the food.   The best thing and best deal on the menu would be the sampler plate with ribs, fish, shrimp and nachos. Their spinach dip is addictive. Split it with someone you love. Their alcoholic drinks are good. All their desserts are good. They're priced well at $4 each. I've never waited long for seating or service. My husband and I don't have kids. Some parents let their kids run around and some don't. This place is either packed or quiet. It's good for a date.   People are saying the environment is touristy. That's not a bad thing. My cousin from Germany says that it reminds her of Disneyland on account of the animatronics. I take it as a compliment.

I went here on my 2 year anniversary. The food looks really good, a very extensive menu and full bar. My only issue - I got food poisoning that night and threw up. Missed work the next day. I ate crab soup, seaweed ice cream and we split a mixed drink of tropical ingredients so it's hard to identify the culprit. The prices are outrageous and the servings small. The puking makes me want to run back to Kyoto Bowl for good cucumber rolls and better prices.

I love this place! The park is one of the last ones where parking and day use is free. The parking lot is almost always empty. You can pick the sidewalk trail if you're in the mood or on a different day, you can pick the trails going up to the peak. It's picturesque, bring your camera. There's lots of ramada seating.   But on top of that, it also has a mysterious nature. Google Dreamy Draw Park and you'll find a Wikipedia article about its UFOs and ghosts. Apparently, a UFO crashed around the same time as the Roswell UFO. This is the reason the Highway is numbered 51, after Area 51. The dam was an excuse to pour dirt on top of the crash site, giving this a cool factor rating of 5.   But wait! Read on and you'll learn that there is a green lady spector seen on the dam at night. Also, there used to be a cinnabar mine there and many hundreds of miners died in the dangerous conditions. The cool factor goes up to 10.  Upon learning about this, I had to go close to sundown and try to record an EVP, which I had done at other places, just never found anything. (I've also been to the Eisendrath House, but all was silent there.) Well, here on a peice of audio when I didn't realize my husband had left the camera rolling, we caught a sarcastic? or excited? ethereal voice saying, "Nooo, wait" right before I shut off the camera.   The last time I was there, a bee hive was above the water fountain. You couldn't get close to the fountain. Take your own water. Also, be aware that there are no palo verdes in this park. Once you're on the trails, you're exposed to the sun all the time.   So if you're looking for the paranormal, rest, excitement or adventure, you'll find it here.

This place is going through an identity crisis. Obviously owned by the Suki Hana next door, there's just a few things here that are really scream Cajun. Blackened fish? Check. Bourbon Chicken? Check. But chow mein and steamed vegetables in soy sauce? Um no. Being served by an entire staff of Chinese people doesn't fool me neither.   Now the bourbon chicken tasted good enough and you pay about $6 a plate. But their Asiatic version of black bean rice was flat. They should try to create some side dishes to go with the main course meat that you know, are actually Cajun. Like French bread, pea soup, jambalaya rice, Cuban soup or even stuffed peppers. At least the meat was thoroughly cooked and not too greasy.   The seating is horrible. On any given Sunday, you can sit in their cramped food court and it's almost certain that some fat chick with an oversized diaper bag and her toddler with a leg sticking out will walk behind you, bumping into every chair. And you can forget about trying to carry a conversation in this place.

I only wish I could travel to the East Coast. I'm a Phoenix native. So I can't compare this to NY. However, I've taken the bus and I can honestly say the buses suck balls.   I prefer the light rail because the clientele is a step up from the bus's. Once I treated my husband to a ride downtown so we could eat and a really stinky person boarded and thankfully got off after a long 10 minutes.   PROS: Affordable, clean, safe, efficient, free parking at the Park and Rides. Sweeps by attractions in Tempe and downtown Phoenix. If you flew into PHX and stayed downtown, you wouldn't need to rent a car.    CONS: It should have been built above the street. Cars and people sometimes get hit. Needs to extend through downtown Mesa, then turn south to Chandler Mall. On the other side needs to extend over to the Cardinals Stadium. Hours need to be extended to cut down on drunk driving and for people who work graveyard.

PLEASE NOTE - Red Seven is also called Hyperion Works and the Tempe and Mesa locations are now closed. Their ONLY location is at US-60 and Rural. It's a little tricky to find. It's south of the US-60 off a little unnamed street. You pull into the hotel parking lot. Hang a left through the archway. The store is on the first floor behind the fountain.   This is the only place I will take my computer for virus removal. No matter who works on my computer, it gets done right and for a competitive price too. Their turnaround time is reasonable compared to other places. You can't ask for anything more.  To boot, one guy who did my repair switched out Vista for Windows 8 for free saying that it was more secure. He also installed Microsoft Essentials, my malware detector, for free.

This is a ma and pa store and that's one reason why I like it. Stop in and see George if you can. I've been here once and actually got served by George. Yes, they really are Greek. The place is a little, yellow joint with a tiny outdoor table with one rainbow colored umbrella over it. The inside is better. They have a tiny table and some stools for a "bar". However, there are cool posters of Greece on the wall that make up for the modesty of the place. The gyros are good, not sure about the American food. They have cold beers. Prices are reasonable. It's always dead when I drive by it. Hope it survives the depression. Tried to go back one time at 10AM when the door said it was open but the door was locked and nobody was inside. If I had more cash on hand, I would try another trip.

This was my first time in a Chick-Fil-A and I was curious. I came here to wait while my husband was in an interview. I had heard things about them in the news.   Just one dollar sign is in the price range. No way, not even close. For $7, you get a puny salad and a drink. A value meal is ~ $8. Christian or not, it's such a rip-off.   And the girl that served me had a creepy attitude. When I said "thank you" to her twice, for ringing me up and bringing me the food, she responded with a weird, melodramatic "Pleasure..."  All the 5 stars below must be employees.

Quick service. The employees actually seem happy. Bathrooms always clean. I prefer this Taco Bell over others because their outside deck is huge and shaded.   Lower the price of limeade and I might actually get one.

Not only did I get rung up quickly, but the woman who rang us up came out and put in the battery for us and removed the corrosion around the wires.   Another time, we purchased a tail light and the dude put it in for us.   They must have a really good customer service training video.

I love Mesa but their utility dept. needs to be investigated for fraud. Since I'm on and off employed, I pay as many bills as I can in advance. I sent $320 in to the utility dept. which should have been about three month's worth. When my next bill was sent the following month, I noticed that my credit was not applied. I couldn't reach anyone on the phone (high volume of calls) so I took a photograph of my money order stubs and sent in a letter to this address. Two weeks later, I received a letter explaining how I was not ahead, but "right on time" with my payments. I called and finally reached somebody and they made every excuse in the book to make it "make sense" for them. I need to write to the Governor, I guess. Don't take a summer vacation and try to pay your utility bill in advance. They will take your money. Pay your bill exactly one month at a time!!!

This location has a decent patio with lots of shade. Getting out from the drive thru can be dicey because it's almost on the corner.   I love the moolatas and blizzards and the peanut parfait. The only problem is deciding what you want. They have the less popular pineapple malts. Not my thang, but it's my husband's thang.  I had a hot dog once here. It made me slightly nauseous. Maybe it wasn't cooked all the way? Stick to the ice cream.

Everything on the menu is good. The French onion soup is thick with thick slices of onion. All their pastas are decent, the sauce could use some thickening. Clam chowder and brocolli cream are really, really good. The blueberry bread is moist and crumbly. You'll probably pay too much for soup and sandwich so for just a couple bucks more, get an entrée. I like that they have hot tea bags on each table that come with all these flavors, like raspberry.   At this location, the waitress misunderstood and thought my dad was asking for a la carte instead of the combo. As a result she didn't bring out the fries, but 10 minutes later, we had the fries. Only downside to this location is that my dad almost got mugged in the same parking lot (not on this day, when he was alone). Since it's located in Desert Ridge, this can be expected and also this branch can be hard to find in such a huge plaza.

I was setup for disappointment on account of the false advertisements. I actually read reviews before I went here. They are way off. The ads said there were thousands of petroglyphs here, even suggesting to come at 10AM when the sun shines on the glyphs and to bring your own binoculars. On top of that, the website said that there is a butterfly exhibit in Feb. that was part of the "tour". Sounds awesome, right? And I'm a pretty good photographer too.   So I get here. The visitor's center is nice and informative. However, the price is a little steep for what you get. I walk through the back gate and enter the trail. It's a flat, pebbled trail, only a 1/4 mile long. There is no "tour guide", nor a "tour". There was no butterfly exhibit. I'm there at exactly 10AM and there are not thousands of petroglyphs. Even with the binocs, they are hard to find and faded. For just $6 parking, you can see way more glyphs at South Mountain Park on the Kiwanis Trail.  The most exciting part about this tour was that a large squirrel approached us (see attached photos) and was really, really curious about us. You reach the end of the trail and that's when you figure out that you've been duped. If it wasn't government run, it would have been shut down a long time ago.

You need to be as hungry as a bear to eat here. "Side Salads" are as big as your head and that's why they're $12 each. Bring tupperware.   The drink menu is the size of a small novella. You'll have difficulty picking just one. I recommend the Mexican Coffee.   I only downgraded because it does take awhile to get seated and they could cut the portions in half and charge half as well.

This is BY FAR the best Middle Eastern restaurant I've eaten at. It's inside a small plaza that's nothing flashy, but step inside and it's like walking into a vacation. The place is small, cozy and elegant. All the staff is friendly. The prices are kinda high.   The waitress warned me that the Arabic coffee is strong and sweet. She brought out a tiny expresso-sized coffee (I assumed I was getting a full mug), however, the price is reasonable compared to a real café and it was super yummy and just the right sweetness.   Let me say that I've eaten at other Persian restaurants, such as Al-Ameera on Broadway, and that they have messed up my falafal before, with a terrible taste, that is, and well...how do you mess up something that is as popular as pizza to them?? But Sahara's falafal was generous and yummy. Their hummus is thick and creamy. Their pita bread is warm and made to perfection. I ordered a tabouli salad as an appetizer and it was my first time trying tabouli and it was very flavorful. It could have been a bland salad but the cook must have lots of experience with mint and lemon juice and exactly how to use them.   I dragged my dad and husband to this place, trying to convince them that there's nothing wrong with foreign food, you know, sometimes you have relatives whose taste buds aren't as adventurous as yours. I made believers out of them.

This location is quieter than the one at Arizona Mills Mall. No screaming kids in your way. The clothes are less disheveled, still attached to the hanger, but for the same low price. I get my husband's work shirts here for like $8. Ross understands that there are still skinny Americans out there and they carry size 4 pants. YESSSSS!  Unusual house goods you can find at Ross. I redid my whole bathroom and made it into a nice Victorian style in light pink and a wood brown. They had this soft-green painted shelf that looked like a twisted vine. Where else can you find something like that? I found these two toothbrush cups that were painted with butterflies. Worth the $5 each. My bathroom is gorgeous. You'll want to take a crap in there.

I really dig their two-person specials with dessert for like $20. Their cheese and broccoli soup is super creamy. They have every flavor of tea imaginable so when I come here, I make mine pomegranate.   Our waiter was chill. I ordered "penne" and explained that saying it makes me laugh because while it's pasta in Italian, it also means "dick" in Spanish at which he laughed and went and told everyone who works in the back.   Well, everything's filling. Come hungry.

I had quite the spiritual experience here. When I came, there were warning signs at the Waterfall trailhead that said that mountain lions had been spotted earlier in the day. Awesome. I had my camera and was ready for a fabulous photo op. (In hikes elsewhere I have a record of seeing a bobcat, a black bear, coyotes and Gila monsters). A mountain lion would be a first for me.   But that's not what happened. I get to the tinaja at the end of an easygoing trail. Perfect weather. Petroglyphs along the way. Nobody on the trail. The tinaja is very peaceful. I climbed to the second one up and in the back. I snap two pictures. I get home and upload the pictures to my computer and that's when I notice the oddity in one of the photos. Inside the tinaja is an Indian face that appears to be looking out and is highlighted by the reflections and water ripples (see attached photo). The other photo I had taken two seconds earlier doesn't have this anomaly.   I left, my experience complete.

For our birthdays, my parents treated me and my husband out to Famous Dave's. Our waitress, Brenda, was really good and friendly and I could have sworn she'd been a waiter for a long time but she told us that it was her first week. Nevertheless, she knew the entire menu and answered my mom's questions about the garbage can platter.   Let me say that the ribs are seriously meaty!!! About an inch thick from the bone. I love all the choices in the barbeque sauces. Their coleslaw is super creamy (I don't think it has onions in it, hey, not everyone can eat onions). The pork and beans were warm and not from a can. Afterwards, they brought out ice cream for us on account of our birthdays and the cool part is they bring it out with a sparkling Roman candle on the plate; it's quite a sight.   Only dinged them one star for a few MINOR reasons. The platter is just too much meat. It's almost nothing BUT meat. It'd be great if they mixed it up and replaced those huge chicken breasts with more of those carrot sticks (we only got two for four people), and maybe with onion rings or mustard potato salad. The corn muffins are NOT good at all. They taste like cardboard.   On a quick note, the little drawing that the waitress is forced to draw on the plate is useless. It's trivial and the plate just takes up more room on an already cramped table.

Pete's is the place you want to go if you're short on time and money because it's reasonably priced fish. Don't even think about dining in here. The convenience is in using the drive-thru and I love seeing their mural. I have always wondered - do their murals ever get ruined by graffiti or do the gangsters just respect Pete?   Cash only. Which I think is a good thing because drive-thru is super fast. The food is always hot and fresh. Everything is breaded and if you say "no salt", they've always gotten it right. You can get scallops for like $4. It's a deal, Pete!

Always heard the advertisements for this place on the radio. Was given the impression it was a real hip place to go. Well, when you see the outside, the big Cadillac and the entrance with all the license plates, you think you're in for a treat. It's just a facade. Get inside, sit down. You realize they keep the place inside too cold. At least the bathrooms are clean. I ordered the bacon wontons because that was the cheapest thing on the menu ~$8. When I got it, I was shocked by the small portion. You get used to the taste, but when I was done, I felt a little nauceous. Maybe cream cheese and maple syrup isn't the best combination? For your money and time, go elsewhere.

I plan to take better care of my skin in the future. I'll probably make SWINA my go-to place for chemical peels. Jackie did great, informing me about what she was doing and was good company while the chemicals were being absorbed into my skin. This is a school and a business so the students are working on you but they're great, only about 1/3 of the price you'd pay at a medical spa. Their peels include the neck and collarbone. Not every place includes that in the price.

The original fish taco has a big hunk of meat. This ain't no wimpy Taco Bell taco. A la carte is priced at 2.79. But I suggest the combo at 6.49, which comes with two tacos, rice and beans and a drink. Hey, no need to tip.   They have a clean salsa bar with about 8 different salsas. Sliced limes are set out too. Try their raspberry tea on tap. It's tasty.   Our cashier Ramon had a smile. A lady's toddler dumped something on the floor and Ramon mopped it up and was like "no problem".  Outdoor seating is plentiful and each table is covered by a tiki umbrella.

This place serves the Phoenix area but has a small town feel once you step inside. It's a trendy cafe, a cute gourmet sandwich shop and relaxing chocolate shop all in one. There's couches and a TV if you want. They keep it off. They have games on a shelf and a game table. There's so much on the menu. The prices would be the same if you went to Starbucks (which I wouldn't). They have cheesecake on a stick and my husband got his favorite pineapple shake. The whole front of the shop is a window and it's nice to sit and watch the cars go by. My husband and I took the light rail into Phoenix just to go here. I had researched the place looking for a cool date and I found it. The coffee satisfies my "pink spot".

PROS: If you have been boycotting Starbucks for a long time, this is the place to escape to.   They have a coffee drink called 911.   Staff is really cool and one informed me that they give proceeds to MDA.   CONS:  A small menu of coffee to choose from.   No shady area to sit. You have to drive thru and go find that shade elsewhere.

What's the point of the Red Robin cards if when you walk in the waiters get to decide that they're "expired"? Note: there isn't an expiration date anywhere on the cards. We refused service and left. It was a gift card from my mom by the way.

UPSIDES:  Good location, cute decor, soft jazz music, friendly service, wifi, really yummy cheddar broccoli soup (only served Sun. thru Tues.), a good cup of Chai tea for only $2.50  DOWNSIDES: Small portions, by the time you order enough food it gets pricey, could get really crowded if you're there at the wrong time, just okay egg salad, which is made entirely of eggs and not with lettuce like I was thinking, the cute Italian breadsticks are flavorless (have they not heard of garlic?)

Everything starts with a complimentary loaf of sourdough.   This restaurant is mostly about ambience. You are transported to a cute little wharf. Pictures of the ocean and stuffed fish decorate the walls. There's a huge ship-in-a-bottle on display.   But when it comes to the food, like everybody else is saying, the portions are small for the price. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos. The fish is dipped in hot spices but it's not terribly hot because the cabbage and avocado on top mellow it out. They were good but not worth the $13.50.   I picked couscous for the side. Their couscous is not what I expected. I'm spoiled by the cracked wheat/vegetables on top variety. Their couscous is composed of large pearl seeds topped with yellow peppers and sliced almonds. It was very bland. It'd be worth the price if you could pick two sides.  Our waiter, Roland, was really chill and personable. However, I can't recommend the Bluewater Grill. Skip this place and head to Red Lobster.

For such a small place, they do have a decent sized sushi list. Prices are about what you'd expect for sushi so it's a step above Kyoto Bowl without going overboard. If you're not getting sushi, about all you can expect otherwise would be some kinda teriyaki bowl, unless you plan on getting full on miso soup and edamame. The sushi was absolutely fresh. Potstickers were perfect. Kudos on having raspberry tea as well as regular. Get here @ 11AM if you want in. We did and I noticed that there is a huge business casual line by 11:30 on a weekday. They have a nice big screen TV with CNN news playing at a decent volume. Right on.

All Wal-Marts suck. This one especially is an anomaly.   Around Easter, they got rid of the lamb shanks they sold at $7/each and replaced them with a huge rack of lamb, wait for it... for $40!!!   On the same visit, I saw a cardboard display with a bin full of 50 cent spices. I think "all right, found a deal". Wrong. Happened to notice the ingredients on so-called "lemon pepper" and the list read like a chemistry book. When I buy $1 spices at Fry's, I don't have to read the ingredients to know what I'm getting.   Regardless of the number of items in your cart, one thing or a mountain of stuff, it takes 30 minutes to get through a line. That was my last shopping experience at ANY Wal-Mart and it's been a few years. I value my sanity.

This place is classier than Haji-Baba and more gourmet than Sahara's. Please note that you pay more for this than the other two places.   *Belly dancers are there on Fri. and Sat. starting at 7:30pm.   *Though it's a Lebanese restaurant, they do have a full bar.   I love the atmosphere at Mijana's. The portions are huge and had I known I would not have ordered two things. The lentil soup was warm, thick and creamy. It tasted gourmet to me. I've never had fattoush before and it was alright. Tastes somewhat like a Greek salad to me. They serve generous amounts of pita as a free appetizer and they give you sesame seed oil for dipping. Their Arabic coffee is not sweet like at Sahara but still good. We arrived when the waitress was on a lunch break and the manager offered us a place to sit and he would serve instead. For that, he's awesome.

Lori made me feel comfortable even though I was getting all my hair hacked off. I was sick of my super long hair and even though I couldn't really describe the cut I wanted (short hair newbie), she asked some questions and got an idea of what I wanted and from there was able to achieve a new, exciting look for me. I went in first thing in the morning and the place was dead. I've been cramped in the waiting room when it was busy before and still, they are great at getting you finished. Never needed an appointment.

Only reason I went here is because our car was purchased through DriveTime and their deal comes with 3 free oil changes per year (for the entire 5 year loan btw). Everytime we come here the mechanics tell of us of some leak or part that needs to be replaced.   Little does Sears know that I have a personal mechanic on the side. After he inspected it, he informed me that there were, in fact, no leaks. Tsk, tsk!

On 10/27/2011, I took my computer in to SoftQue because my computer wouldn't allow me to open anything on the desktop, all I could do was turn on my computer, clearly a virus. I also couldn't uninstall OpenOffice. I gave my box to Chelsie. The next day they called and said they could find no virus and that everything opened up just fine for them. They couldn't explain why I couldn't open anything. I asked them to uninstall OpenOffice, so they did and I was charged $59 for this. I brought it home and tried it. Everything did open up for me, however, my internet was super slow and it wouldn't let me click on certain hyperlinks that open new windows. So I still had a virus. A few days later, my computer just went blank and nothing worked again. This time I took it to Red Sevens, who charges less to fix viruses anyway. The only reason I took it to SoftQue in the first place is because Red Sevens had moved 10 miles further but apparently the longer trip is warranted.

Go here for the books. Go for the little cafe nook in the front. They DO have good coffee and little snacks so it's like going to Starbucks without the Starbucks name. That's all fine.   What I want to talk about is outside the library and why this is the best library in all of Phoenix. There are winding paths in front, to the side and behind the library. They have created a xeriscape garden where you can view and learn about more exotic desert plants. They have a rare Chinese silk floss tree. (see the three attached pics) I recommend getting a coffee AND strolling these parts. Don't worry about the heat. There's lots of shade. Oh yeah, and they have peacocks wandering the parking lot and they aren't shy.   Behind the library is a gate going directly to Saguaro Ranch. It's a Victorian era house rumored to be haunted. There's a huge orchard and a funny little outhouse. You have to make a reservation to go through the house. The rest is free. So the big thing about this library is the exterior.

I lived here for a year and a half. My review will be very different from most people's (I guess). Let me say firstly that it's expensive here, about $800/month for a one bedroom and that's too much for "luxury" apartments. They used to have a convenient computer room with internet, but got rid of it, I guess, cause they figure by now everyone there had a laptop. They replaced it with a café. They have a gym that saves on a ridiculous gym membership. Don't know if they have that still. There's a gorgeous pool, but the little wading pool to the side is not a spa, just a cold "children's" pool. The guest toilet had a hole in the plumbing and so there were always tree roots growing into the toilet, which the maintenance man would have to cut back using "the snake". The people who live here are of questionable character. When my husband was off at work, strange men would knock on my door around 11PM. Not cool. They may have been looking for my upstairs neighbor, who I believe was prostituting herself and would have a couple of guys lined up outside her apartment. There was a drug-related shooting in the building adjacent to ours. They put up a fence, however, it's just for show. I never saw the residents actually use the number punch device to get in because the gate automatically opens. The fence does nothing to protect you from the crazies within.  What I really want to talk about is a little discovery I've made: #P104 is haunted. We lived in it. The first week we lived there I had a weird dream in which I was following a little blonde girl wearing an old-fashioned dress down the hallway. She was trying to show me something but I was too scared to look so I woke up. Then we started seeing dark shadow men in our bedroom when trying to go to sleep. Another time a glass we had on the counter shattered violently. I would be standing in the living room, in broad daylight hours, and I could hear the soft pitter-patter of feet down the hallway and going past me. (No pets, nothing visible that should cause that!) The maintenance man who'd worked there for twenty years informed us that the place dates back to the 60's and used to be a part of ASU. Records show it was built in 1969. The original block-style bricks are visible in the closets. If a little girl was murdered there, there's no record of it.

I love Greek, but I'm on a budget. This is definately budget food! I mean, there's no tip because it's fast food. They prepare it fresh, but serve it expendiently. They have good Tahini sauce. They have good lamb. You can get a side of falafel that tastes really good for $3 and share with everyone. Their pitas are filling. They have food that crosses over into Middle Eastern. Good variety on the menu. I used to go to the Pita Jungle or the way more expensive My Big Fat Greek restaurant three miles west, but for the food and prices, this place hits the spot. Opa!

Save your money and go to Kyoto Bowl. Our waiter gaves us our metal bowls and then coddled my family like we're children. They have all the waiters follow us to get in line for the self-service buffet. They stand there like if you get out of line, you're bad. Weird...During this time, the waiter goes on and on about their food and what they have. Then when you get to the buffet, the choices are very limited and the food is so full of fluff you don't get to put much food in. Some of it is meant to be like sushi, uncooked, but since you put it in a bowl, it gets cooked with everything else. Oh yeah, and the place is loud. You'll have to sit elbow to elbow to hear your family. The novelty about this place is that you can watch the cooks cook your dismal amount on an open fire oven. That's the coolest thing about this place. They serve it in these trendy lopsided bowls. At this point, the food has really shrunk. The food is tasteless. Anyways, they give you the bill and even though somebody else paid for my bill, I was shocked by the price ~ $10 a bowl. If I had $10, I'd rather go to Taco Bell.

This being one of the healthier places where you can eat at Chandler Mall, it's as good as any Middle Eastern restaurant you'd find in a plaza. I had the falafel pita for about $6.50. An additional Greek salad with a drink is an extra $3.50. Not the most economical place to go for that Middle Eastern fix. Their falafel is big and flavorful. Their baklava is well priced at $1.75. The two ladies there (one was named Zina) were friendly and served me speedily with a smile. I even got to try out my Arabic with Zina, ha ha.

I am alarmed at all the 1 stars for this place. You on crack? I must defend this place. As an American, the fact that it's both Japanese and Chinese is awesome. I like having a choice of both chow mein and sushi. I've eaten at other sushi places and this place has good, SAFE sushi (yes, I can tell) for a very reasonable price. If you have a problem paying $6.99 for lunch, then go to Sweet Tomatoes where you'll pay a lot more for ZERO sushi. My visit was on a Thursday at 11:15AM. I noticed that it got really busy at 11:30. Try to beat that crowd, okay?   No menu is needed as it's a buffet. Their only menu has beer and wine. Each wine glass is priced at $4.50. The buffet has many selections. Of course, they have chow mein and fried rice and don't forget the *sushi*. They also have whole sea bass, spinach salad, sweet and sour chicken, pork potstickers, cream dumplings and many other Asian mainstays. They have lots of soups. For the sushi wimps, they do have an assortment of American foods like pizza, taquitos and french fries (a good thing if your kids aren't acclimated to Asian food). A whole separate buffet line is dedicated to desserts, such as tiramisu, jello and Turkish delight.   The place is in the old Black Angus building. The old building had too many walls up and felt stuffy. The renovations made it into a more spacious area, a tad romantic and calming. Their muzac plays contemporary rock hits low in volume. I had to smile as I heard "Smooth Criminal" lightly playing in the background. They have a couple of large screen TVs playing prime time coverage of the Olympics. Somebody commented that the place has glaring, changing lights. One of the banisters has a leaf pattern that changes slowly from green to red to brown. It's soothing, not flashy at all. The place is mostly lit by chandeliers. The clientele is white, middle-aged, without kids and they seem respectful. My waiter was attentive and offered me a refill on my tea before I finished it. All the waiters seem to speak good English, with little accents. (I've been to Asian places where they were only capable of nodding.)  Yes, the place is clean. The wood floor is in pristine shape and looks very clean. The table was clean and in good condition. The chair was clean, no stuffing coming out. As for that one bathroom picture, you can't diss Hibachi Grill for one bad apple, can you? My husband used the bathroom and said that there was nothing on the floor. Somebody else said the food was cold. Everything that was supposed to be warm was kept warm and I hope that reviewer wasn't talking about the sushi, as sushi is supposed to be cool and crisp.   When I told my waiter the pictures were for my Yelp profile, he seemed a little nervous, though I assured him I'd give 5 stars. I came here, now I understand why. He indicated to me that they went through some staff changes and that they were doing better. So it seems they have it together now. I left the place delightfully burping.

My husband treated me here for a second time because we love it.   Just wanted to put down more delicious stuff that they have because the variety of food is remarkable: stuffed mushrooms, crabmeat, baked scallops, lobster, shrimp ceviche, teriyaki broccoli. On the American side, I did notice roasted duck, BQ ribs and buffalo wings.   This time, I had my helping of sushi, but with tofu and shrimp ceviche. It's as good as from any Mexican restaurant, if not better. I finished it off with green tea ice cream, which was soooo good.

The dumbasses sold me the wrong size intake hose because they didn't have the right size in stock. I bought a fancy hydraulic jack there and while it was great for awhile the thing broke shortly afterwards.

A year ago, I purchased a refurb (I know, my bad) and one new phone for my husband and I, who just needed basic surface, none of this texting/camera/internet crap. We wanted a deal. Got a phone plan for $70 a month, paid about $300 total for the phones. They were both pieces of junk. The connection was almost always scratchy or the other person would come in and out. The phone's reception was so sensitive that the connection could cut out at any time. It especially would lose reception if somebody drove by me with a boombox, it would make me cringe if somebody drove by blaring one. We also paid $15 for our service to work outside of the local area on a per minute basis when we traveled to Sedona. Once in Sedona, we weren't able to call into Phoenix. The phone was barely good enough to call the cops one day. When you go to this Cricket location, they make you wait as if you're waiting for a ride at Disneyland. Then when you finally get to the counter, good luck not finding an illegal working there that speaks decent English. They all have bad attitudes. A friend refered me to AT and T. I got a holiday deal where I paid only $60 for brand new phones (it's a rebate, will get that back), the monthly service is only $60 and the reception and volume is absolutely clear.

Bizarre! This place is layed out horribly. It's confusing when you walk in because you don't know where to order. Now they've got neon signs but they are lost amid all the vintage signage. They should have a separate door for catering. They don't. If you order a salad, you must pick up your fries and drink separately! Makes zero sense.   Plus the place is freezing. There's food on the floor. There's co-workers walking around, cleaning very sloooowly. They don't look thrilled to be there and neither was I. Oh, and it's noisy. I recommend eating outside where you can hear yourself.   The Mediterranean salad is decent but I'm not dying to return just for that. I can get my Greek fix anywhere.
