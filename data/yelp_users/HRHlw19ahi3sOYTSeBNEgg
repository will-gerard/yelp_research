Terrible service. Went here with my family an I ordered a gyro. The pita bread was more like calzone bread, barely any sauce, 2 tomatoes, and disgusting red onion. I asked the waiter to take it off the bill, which he did, but he gave me major attitude. If I had not been with my grandparents I would have probably got in a verbal altertcation with him. But I guess I have to feel bad for the kid, being a waiter in fountain hills. Anyways stay clear of this place.

Naan is decent, saag paneer is awful. I think they may use cheddar cheese in it. The buffet always looks picked over (I have been there on more than one occasion) On  a positive note the gulab jamon is amazing

Staff is a tad bit rude but pizza is amazing. Jalape√±os are the spiciest I have ever had. Delivery is always there within 35 min.

The secret sauce is amazing. The chicken is high quality and tasty. The owner, Alan, is a nice guy. Always makes sure the customers are happy and you can tell he actually likes his job. I have been eating here for about 3 years and have never had a bad meal.

I have been going to Chandra for almost 8 years. Her hair cuts are amazing, she always makes me look like a rock star and I love it. The salon is great too. Beautiful and sweet women greet you. They also do a great job on my eye brows. Love this place

So I went in here and saw that they have Mac n Cheese. What I got was better than I could have ever hoped for. It's homemade Mac N Cheese, the noodles were cooked perfect and the mixture of the cheeses( I believe 3 of them) went perfect together. I am embarrassed to say but I not only for seconds, I went for thirds! And they are very big portions too, I just couldn't get enough. The tomato mozzarella sandwich is awesome as well. The staff is super nice, don't pass this place up.

The mutter paneer was good. It was not the best I have ever had but good. I like this place, the prices are reasonable, the food is tasty and the people are nice. The naan that came with the meal was ok, next time I will have to order garlic naan. I will be back for sure.

This place is just a rip off of the Flame Broiler down the street. Ribs are awful, chicken is fatty, and the service is slow.
