It's hard to be from North Carolina with roots in KC and get BBQ that is up to your standards. Today, after trying to visit another place for BBQ, my friend suggested Thee Pitts Again. Walking in, I felt a little intimidated by the overwhelming presence of stuff on the walls and trophies everywhere. We were greeted quickly, sat even faster and served in timely yet patient manner. The food was good and at a good price I would say this is a good value for your lunch-time dollar.   Thanks, Pitts, for a nice lunch and great service!

I've been going to BJ's for about 2 years. They've always taken good care of me and made sure that my car was in top condition. I've been through three vehicles during that time (two that I still have) and both of them are serviced, washed and fueled at BJ's Auto Spa. I trust the Chevron gas, my truck is super clean and it runs better than ever.   From outside service to technical expertise, I can fully recommend BJ's Auto Spa!

Now, an old favorite in downtown Phoenix, Pizzaria Bianco is always a solid choice if you have enough time to really enjoy the experience. Start by putting your name on the list and having a drink at the wine bar next door. And then, enjoy your dinner.

Without all the frills of a downtown bar or even the convenient location, Magnums Cigar, Wine, and Liquor Emporium is becoming one of Phoenix's hottest hang-outs. The bar, a traditional setting boasting oak with marble inset tables and bar tops, spares no expense to achieve a comfortable and designer setting.   On top of comfort the bar is pleasing to the eye. Incredible artwork and designer posters appropriately line the walls. However, walking into the bar itself present a religious experience for liquor lovers of all kinds. Stocked with micro-brews from all over the world, a respectable gallery of wine, and a shelved bar back full of traditional and exotic liquors no patron will go thirsty.  Without question, the bar staff rivals the best of the best (think Durant's) and ensures a pleasant experience. After just one trip to the bar a return visit was met with a memory of my first visit and a nearly accurate guess at my favorite drink (grey goose martini, dirty, on the rocks).  Enough about the bar, you'll have to check it out to see the rest. Walking into Magnum's you would never know the swanky outfit you are about to enjoy as it is located in a strip mall at 7th street and Union Hills (SE Corner). Upon entrance you recognize the passion with which owner, Amar Patel, approaches his work. A beautifully stocked wine and liquor inventory presents the patron with their regular everyday choice spirits among others for special occasions.   Then, after a quick glance around the place you notice IT, the humidor. Your first visit requires a tour from one of the very capable staff. If Amar is there, ask him to talk you through the many selections offered in his meticulously stocked humidor.   Smoking cigars and cigarettes is allowed in Magnum's, the only bar of its kind in all of Arizona.

Being from the North Carolina coast and now living in Glendale, Arizona I find that the food I miss the most is seafood. Clearly living in Arizona limits my ability to find good, fresh seafood-let alone trying to find well prepared seafood. Tonight I found fresh seafood that was prepared just the way I like it-fried with extra sides of tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, coleslaw (mayo not red), and a healthy selection of domestic beer.   Ty, the server at the counter, was helpful and very interested in making sure the dining experience was met with great service. While the atmosphere left you feeling like you may end up with a pirate cap (e.g. Long John Silver), the beach music on the radio made me feel like I was home.   This wonderful little find came to me by pure accident as my wife was giving me directions to Next Place Coffee (see my next review) and mistakenly gave me 59th and Union Hills as cross-streets. Great mistake, babe, because we were treated to a little bit of home.   I'd recommend Oscar's Pier 83 to anyone in the market for a quick, well prepared dinner.

On a recommendation from my wife for a great place to have a meeting, I suggested to my new clients that we meet at Next Coffee Co. For a first visit I was surprised when the folks behind the barista immediately recognized me as a new customer and took the time to explain their services. As an avid tea-drinker I was pleasantly confronted with many options for both iced and hot tea.  With a full breakfast buffet and a solid selection of beverages you can't miss with Next. Make it your next stop in the west valley!

Texting with a friend yesterday about a new place to eat, we settled on Verde as a location for our lunch meeting today. G is usually spot on with his recommendations and only occasionally misses. Today, he missed.   This quaint little restaurant in Downtown PHX is well decorated and provides exactly the kind of visual atmosphere a metropolitan fast-food crossover should.   Unfortunately, the service is lacking personality and overall interest in the customer. While the food was appetizing and provided decent flavor, it was lacking in something special--something that really popped when you took a bite.   Overall, Verde is caught in an economic conundrum many new establishments are facing--cheap fast food or moderately priced gourmet food? Based on their space, it seems the cheap fast food route (a la America's Tacos) is the way to go.   Add a soda fountain, serve cheap beer, and make a taco/salsa bar. It'll speed up the service and reduce overhead.

4 Stars if you know what you're getting here. I find that folks have high expectations for a low price with Asian cuisine. This moderately priced chinese restaurant offers quality, americanized chinese food. In my case, it is the cuisine of choice when in need of comfort food.   Not only that, they deliver! For about the same price as Panda and at a higher quality, I will choose Shangri La far more often than other fast food chinese.   Happy eating...

With open and loud seating, this beer bar offers a great selection of tasty brews from all over the world all micro in nature. The big flavors of lagers, IPAs and porters, among many others, are available to customers as pints or in flights for tasting. Though the menu could be a little more creative, it leaves you with several yummy choices to accompany your beer.   If you're a beer lover and like loud, hip places, this is one you should definitely check out!

Expectations of a place creates the review. If you've ever been in a revolving sushi bar, you know that it is the "buffet" experience of the sushi world. However, they are required under law to maintain a high-level of freshness. In this case, for less than $25, Marcie and I were able to experience great service, sample several types of rolls and salads and had ahi tuna sashimi. There is not another sushi place in the Valley that can compete with their pricing.   All that said, I don't think we'll be heading their for fine dining but, that's not what this place is all about. They provide quality sushi at a great price and service with a smile. Not to mention, we were in and out in less than 45 minutes.   We certainly recommend Kiku for a lunch or lite dinner outing...

The food was delicious and the service was excellent. Only one small complaint - price. I thought the product and price were a little off. That said, It won't deter me from going back and having the half fry bread special with chips.   Glad to have such a unique place in our community!

This past halloween these guys set up a booth for our neighborhood and we loved it so much we've booked them for another event--a wine tasting. They're professional and fun at the same time. They are a must for any event!
