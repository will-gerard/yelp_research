Need a place to study and are in the North Central Phoenix area? Stop by Unlimited, but don't take the couch in the back. That's my seat. Sitting here for a few hours is easy as there are no distractions, plenty of comfortable seating, delicious coffee and tea, and don't forget about the gelato! They make it at the store. Get the red velvet because its better than cake. There are alternatives in the area, but if you haven't been here before try it out.

Hmmm let's see.... Where should I start? I can't really remember when dutch bros and I began our love affair. It has been a while now. I have to say this love doesn't extend to all locations. In fact it only involves this one. Also, the more locations that open the less I like the company. Who are you trying to be?? Starbucks??!!??   Anyways... The annihilator is my favorite. I get it blended, but iced is just as nice. The guys here are ALWAYS awesome. The girls can be too much and seem to never understand the stamp card concept. If you don't like coffee try a berry smoothie. This place is great but would be better f you had the option to escape the Arizona heat by stepping inside. The drive thru is necessary or the walk up joint would sink.   If you like coffee, smoothies or anything DUTCH stop by this Tempe spot.

I love Central Phoenix. love Love LOVE. Unfortunately I am living in Chandler right now and it doesn't look like the coffee shops of the East Valley compare to those found in Central Phoenix. All you find are chains and the few privately owned shops still lack that urban vibe. I'll admit Cartel Coffee Lab comes close but the people who work there are too snobby for their own good. You work in Tempe people not Scottsdale! After getting sick of driving to Phoenix for a decent cup o' Joe I tried out Cup O'Karma.   When I visited it was surprisingly empty even with MCC being right across the street. Is school in session there? Who knows, but I was able to have the whole spot to myself. The reason this place gets 5 stars is not because of its comfortable couches or quirky art on the contemporary walls but because it is non profit. Cup O'Karma was donated by its previous owner for $1 and it is now a NATN community project.   Coffee shop with a cause? I'm in!  If you're in the east valley and are thirsty to support social change stop by and see the folks at Cup O'Karma.

I have put off this review for a long long time for fear that our precious little lounge would be overrun by annoying crowds. But I have to give props where it is deserved and SideBar is on the top of my list.   I first ventured to SideBar early this year after my best friend and I found it during a Yelp search. We got all fancied up and harassed in route at a dive bar we stopped at along the way. Pssh neanderthals they didn't know where we were heading. Well... neither did we.   This place is great. It is by far my favorite downtown spot. It has AMAZING music that is not too loud to converse over. You can expect to hear Portishead, reggae or something groovy. If it is First Friday most likely a DJ will be set up in the corner spinning. There is plenty of comfortable seating for your date and yourself or group of friends. It is chic and contemporary and you cant help but dig the exposed brick.  Tony at the bar is my favorite bartender in town and ALWAYS knows whats up. He introduced my best friend and I to Sammy Smiths Nut ale and Strongbow. This had me voting for SideBar in Phoenix's Best of for almost EVERY category.   I have been to this hidden lounge a lot. I plan to keep venturing there and saying hello to Tony, but the prices are steep so my visits are seldom. Try Sundays if you are on a budget I hear they have 20% off happy hour.

This North Central spot has a relaxed urban vibe with it's patio bar area, contemporary decor, and intimate lighting. The wine racks make a beer drinker want to give it a go. If you do visit you MUST try the bruschetta. You get to choose four types and it is AMAZING. By far the best I have ever had. Definitely try the roasted red pepper. They have a great wine and beer selection and if you can't decide your helpful waitress can narrow down your options based on your taste. My friend ordered the panini which wasn't as good as the bruschetta but is a nice runner up. The lighting is intimate and only compliments the chosen color scheme. If you are looking for a date place this is it. Another thing caught my eye was the unisex bathrooms. I love a place that can offer the sophistication I am looking for while saying farewell to social norms. Keep Phoenix feeling urban Postino.

I work not too far from here and the guys I work with go nuts over this place. I can't help but join the fan fair. Its hard not to when everyone you work with is ordering delicious hummus. When you resist you always regret not indulging and have to deal with the tempting Mediterranean smell. This place does great Greek food at reasonable prices AND THEY DELIVER! For 1.50 they will deliver until 3am!!!!!!!!! When I work the late shift we are still ordering!   I usually get the dio deal which is two gyro pitas for 7.99. If you order hummus it comes in a huge container and is as much if not less than you would pay at the grocer. Except you don't have to wait in the long self check out lines to not know how to scan your item and have a clerk run up and fix it for you anyway.  I used to live on campus and I don't know if this place wasn't around yet or I was just unaware. Either way I was missing out and now you are too.

When you take a look at a place like Hula's and see that it has eighty-eight reviews it makes you think, does it really matter if I put in my two cents? Well maybe Hula's doesn't need my cents, but they are well deserving of five stars and a few dollars.   I am not a huge Yelper. Okay scratch that. I am a huge Yelper but not a very good one.  I love looking at the events and use it to gage the places I venture to, but you will never find me on a forum and rarely writing a review. I decided that Hula's was worth that rare occasion.   Like I said I am a fan of the Events page so I decided to try out Yesterday's Urban Wine Walk. I'll admit that the walk turned out to be a bust for my friend and I (for reasons of timing not event qualms) but Hula's was the best part and made the walk attempt worthwhile. The wine was great and our friendly server was more than willing to describe the options and chat about a great place to find a good Malbec. Thanks for the tip. My favorite wine was the Carmenere they were offering. My friend was a fan of the Fume Blanc.  The only thing we had time for was a starter and we went with the spicy Thai fish cakes, which were amazing. Perfect size and flavor and presented as if it was the after shot for a cooking demo. I have been wanting to try Hula's since they opened and I am willing to admit that the walk was my excuse to get down there. Now I know there is no excuse needed and I will definitely be heading back down for a full dining experience very soon. I suggest you do the same.

Dude if you don't want to wait DON'T. Just means I will be seen quicker. Matt is the BEST barber in town. I used to go to salons and pay twice as much to get 1/2 the quality. I have been seeing Matt for over a year and won't go anywhere else. The partner he brought in does HIS hair and she gives a GREAT cut. This place has tons of entertainment while you wait and free drinks/popcorn. Go early if you really dont want to wait and feel lucky when you walk in and you're the only one! For the cut though I'd wait for over an hour. TOP QUALITY

I've come here A LOT. Today I came for lunch and decided to place an order for take out. Usually we go and have NO ISSUES. This time we were practically ignored while waiting for our take out order, which you order from the bar. We ordered two salads which shouldn't have take 35 minutes to get, but it did. The duck dynasty looking dude at the bar who was getting COMPLETELY WASTED and smelled of alcohol when he walked past us was getting better service. PS it was 12:30 when we were there!!! About 5 people who ordered AFTER us were served their food before ours was ready. When we stood there looking at the bartender with the "where the fuck is our order" glare she told us it was being "boxed up now". 10 minutes later we got our food. I have been there about 6+  times, a few of those were with groups, and I can say I'll never go back. Thanks a lot.
