Love coming here! I come on Fridays and hang out in the bar. Gwen is a great bartender and it's always a great mix of people. Their food is great too. Much better than any bar food I've ever had. If you're looking for a great local bar where they know your name and drink order this is the place to be.

Always good...even when its not 2 am after a night of drinking with friends. I always get the same thing. AZ burrito and a large  Mexican juice of some kind.

Came in on Black Friday for lunch, I had the El Diablo burger and it was delicious. We had Heather Robinson as our server and she was on point with her suggestions not only from the menu but also from the bar. This was my first time here, and I will defiantly be back.

Love the chicken wings and beer. The hot ancho chilli grilled bone in are my favorite. I come here at least once a week to catch a game and get some wings. Well worth it.

If I could give no stars I would. I was told by the hotel staff if I prepaid for my ticket that we would get in. I arrived an hour early per recommendation by hotel staff. 4 hours later I'm still standing in the "pre paid" line. This is the where everyone paid at lest $75 to get in. I must say this is the worst managed club I've ever been to. I've been to other clubs in Vegas and this is by far the worst club I've ever been too. If I were you, go somewhere else on the strip. Omnia can piss off for all I care.

Stopped by at about 7:30 on a Saturday night for a late dinner after reading other reviews on yelp. I must say I was not disappointed. I ordered the two meat platter. I got sliced brisket, I wanted the hot links but they were out so I got the pulled pork. I added two pork rib bones to the order and I wanted to try the maple bacon doughnut but the lady in front of me got the last one. I had my meal there and tried all the BBQ saues, I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce but I had to try them. The mustard sauce was my favorite with the hot in a close second and the vinegar sauce bringing up the rear. I will defiantly be back.
