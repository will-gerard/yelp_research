Rustler's Rooste is a great place to eat. It sits on a mountain so you can get a great view of the city as you eat. The staff is great, they even have a close up magician. Food was delicious too. If you live in Phoenix, you really need to eat at Rustler's Rooste at least once in your life.

I got my passport photos taken and printed here, in and out in about 15 minutes total. I was very impressed by their quality and speediness.

I walked in this morning and the manager greeted me with a "Goooooood morning!" Very cheery to be there. Everyone was very friendly. The eating area is a bit smaller than other Einstein's, but it is attached to a Starbucks, so that's a plus.

The big plus is that this Starbucks is attached to an Einstein's. The customer area is a bit smaller than other Starbucks, but it's got the Starbucks drinks you know and love.

The only problem I've ever had here was one in October when they were out of pumpkin, but they said all Einsteins in the area were. Aside from that, I've always enjoyed this location. It feels like a coffee shop inside, with people gathered to read papers and star their days. The ambiance almost makes me feel like I am back in college while I am there.

It is rare that I try something new every time I go to a restaurant, but Old Chicago is just so good that I can't help myself. Their specialty pizzas are delicious. They also have an impressive beer selection, and make good mixed drinks. I enjoy their spicy bloody mary. Not that we've never had problems at Old Chicago, but when they accidentally brought us a full sized pizza instead of a personal pizza, they only charged us for the personal pizza. And when their roof had a leak during a rain storm, they gave us a free dessert. My fiance and I have been there many times, and will probably return for many more.

This zoo was great, the variety of animals was impressive. They even had my fiance's favorite - penguins!

I've been coming here for years, a great place to browse movies and books. You can get good deals on used movies here.

For a Jack in the Box in that part of town, it was pretty nice.

The biggest downside of Four Peaks is the parking situation. If you go during a peak time, you may end up walking as far as a half a mile to actually get to it. But that speaks to it's popularity, and it's quality. They have good food and great beer.

A very nice atmosphere sitting atop Mill Ave. Their food is well prepared and their specialty beers are quite good.

Penney's has good deals again now that Ron Johnson isn't the CEO anymore and they've brought back coupons and sales :)

Would definitely recommend! I have been here for numerous work lunches with coworkers and it is always a treat. Known for their burgers, I enjoy their fries even more. You can get cinnamon sweet potato fries, spicy fries, rosemary and garlic fries, or regular salt and pepper fries. Cinnamon sweet potato fries are my favorite, the spicy fries a close second.

There is a Subway in the Fry's shopping center nearby that is better. The bread here was still soggy, even after toasting.

I am so angry right now! I went to look at engagement rings with my girlfriend and the salesperson said she would run a credit check to see what I COULD be approved for. On our way out, she suddenly said, "You'll be receiving a Kay card in the mail." As I left, I was like, "Wait, did I hear that right?! I never asked for a credit card?!" When I got home, I called the Kay Jewelers Credit Line and sure enough an account was created in my name. Worse still, that was all I could get through their automated system, and their call center with people who I will have to speak with to actually cancel this account is already closed for the night. I most certainly will NOT be getting a ring from this establishment.

I refer to this Fry's as "the nice Fry's" that is a little out of the way but we sometimes go to because it's nice.

I've been to this Starbucks many times before and I know it switches on and off as being the busiest Starbucks in Arizona, probably because it's right next to ASU West. The staff is always very peppy and friendly. The only downside is that because it is one of the busiest, if you go at a peak time, you may end up waiting twenty minutes for your purchase.

Nice for a McDonald's - I enjoy that they have some cushy chairs!

Went in on national doughnut day, got a large iced coffee and a doughnut for $2.63. Hard to complain about that price!

Very friendly staff, and a good sandwich, with fun side salads to try. They checked on me during my meal and grabbed a napkin for me without my having to ask. Would recommend to anyone in uptown for lunch.

My fiance and I love going to Planet Fitness. She has a membership that allows a guest, and I go as the guest. Unlike most gyms, you can go in as a guest without having to hear the sales pitch. They've got TVs up so you can watch while you work out.

This Buffalo Wild Wings is laid out much more nicely than some of the others I've been to. TVs everywhere, including right over your tables, and good lighting so you can actually see your food. And the wings, of course, are delicious.

The first time my fiance and I went to Zupas, we weren't fans at all. I don't remember exactly what we ordered, but the food did not taste fresh. My finace's salad was made completely with iceberg lettuce. In fact, it became the butt of our jokes afterwards.  But for some reason, recently, all of our friends suddenly started talking about how good Zupas was. We couldn't understand it. They talked us into going back with them.  I'll admit, the food was tastier this time. I had a BBQ Pork Sandwich and my fiance had an Asian Citrus salad. It was better, at least the salad had nutrition, and my BBQ pork sandwich did taste good, but it tasted like something I could cook, and my fiance has made better herself. Look, there's Sweet Tomatoes, Paradise Bakery, Wildflower Bread Company, all of these places are much better than Zupas. There's really no need for anyone to go to Zupas when there are better places that serve similar but better food all within a mile of it.   I will give them the benefit that the interior looks pretty sleak and clean, but that's really all they've got going for them.

Pot Belly is a nice change up when you are tired of Subway for your sandwich options. The sandwiches are a tad pricier for the amount of sandwich you get, it seems like they have a slightly smaller selection of sandwiches and toppings, but all of the sandwiches I've had taste good. But they do have some fun things you can't get at a Subway, like smoothies. Last time my fiance and I went there, they even had a guitar player for ambiance.
