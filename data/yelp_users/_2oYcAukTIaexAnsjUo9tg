Guy knocked me over the head and drug me here caveman-style to get a Philly Steak craving he'd been having out of his system.  He ordered his with onions and bell pepper and two-times extra cheese.  The steak was flavorful, bread was chewy, veggies done just right.   The white american cheese, however, especially when doubled, was like Elmer's Glue on a sandwich. It ruined it for me (not a cheese lover), but my guy sat there munching with a starry-eyed look on his face chewing through all that cheese.  I asked him how it was; he nodded, likely unable to speak due to cheese mouth glue syndrome. To each his own.  My gyro was delightful, one of the finest I've had.   Took away one star for how cramped it is inside. They even encourage you to share tables with strangers.

Stopped in last week for what I thought would be a trip down memory lane; a real genu-ine BBQ place here in downtown Phoenix.   This place was so off-base it actually made me frown.   Maybe I've flown too high. Real BBQ for me was from an old man everyone called "Knuckles" on the side of the road in South Carolina sitting in a lawn chair next to a smoker painted like a pig.   I ordered the 1/2 lb. barbecue pork with two sides. I tried the mac and cheese as well as the cole slaw.   The pork was tough and had no smoke flavor whatsoever. The mac and cheese was watery, to the point where I wanted to ask if they poured in water recently. The cole slaw was ok, just bland. The sauce was alright.  I ordered a sweet tea because, come on, this is a barbecue place. The cashier told me they had RC products. No sweet tea? Get out of here.  Rivers Cuomo the cashier overcharged me for almost twice my meal. I just left and didn't go back. It wasn't even worth getting my money back.

Under construction when I visited today, but still beautiful. Fellow botanical garden-ers were friendly.   Bottled water is not overpriced. At 1.50 a bottle, it didn't sting that I forgot to bring my own water.  Park rangers are stern, silently watching and protecting our pic-a-nik baskets from any impending doom.  Wear your best, as there are tons of photographers running around. This could be your chance to get discovered - maybe your errant hand or part of your backpack will end up in some semi-famous hipster's Flickr!

The best part of shopping here isn't the really great coffee, chewy yummy chocolate croissants, or the faint-worthy deli and prepared foods counter.  The BEST part of shopping here is knowing that by overpaying for simple items that cost less elsewhere, I'm making the savings and deep discounts of Food City and Bashas possible.   It feels like giving to charity, only charity never sends me home with full bags of gourmet groceries after I write them a check.

Wary of a place where I can order alfredo pasta, burgers, carne asada burritos, and cheesecake from the same place - was this to be a jack of all trades and master of none?  Kudos on the burgers being cooked to order, where you can specify from rare to well-done. I'm a medium-rare and he's a medium, and they were accurately cooked.  The burger meat was a little bland, and it seems like they use a frozen beef patty based on the shape. They offer a lot of ways to dress it up to make up for this. We got a fried egg on one, and sauteed mushrooms on the other.  Veggies were crisp, bun was buttered and soft.   Fries were salty and tasted best when completely coated in ketchup.   Pickle was dill-icious, which is a joke I'm pretty sure has never been told before.  My guy's fruit punch was completely watered down by the time it arrived. I would recommend getting all drinks no ice and adding ice when you're ready to enjoy the drinks.  Also, ordered an iced coffee. Standard, passable coffee. Pretty cool that it's delivered.  Bottom line: Menu is expansive. Burger and fries were average. Delivery is fairly priced and quick.

Not one but TWO times had to drive back around and give them back the food they handed me. Two times they gave me someone else's food! Every time I tried to check, they told me they were busy and that I needed to pull forward if I wanted to check.   I just wanted to try their salad.   Every fast food restaurant has the ability to make a decision: are you going to be as bad as everyone expects, or are you going to take the time to do it right?  Wendy's of 301 E Indian School, I hope you read this. Moreover, I hope you try harder to take the time to do it right. I believe in you.

They have an awesomely stocked chocolate walk with 7 million truffles all giving you their best come-hither bedroom eyes.   I'll try to mention things others haven't:  Their gift wrapping is pretty, fun, and classy. You can get something wrapped up as a present and not worry about the paper - the beautiful ribbons and flowers they put on it are lovely.  They have huge fundraising boxes of chocolate that are well-priced and reasonable for your organization or cause. Also, if you are just one person that wants an enormous amount of chocolate but does not wish to be judged harshly, pick up a fundraiser box and tell 'em it's for the kids.  Their peanut butter patties are the only chocolate peanut butter treat that fill my intense longing for my favorite girl scout cookies, Tagalongs. I call it Tagalonging. Thank you, See's, for helping me with my lifelong struggle with addiction.

I took my phone out while walking around. "No photography in the store, hun," to which I replied that I was not. "I know, sweetheart, I'm just sayin', there's no photography in the store, honey."   It's hard enough being a woman that can fix her own car stuff. Being called pet names by strange women does not help.   I contacted corporate and told them that the whole experience made me feel very uncomfortable.   This is where the obviously one star review turns into a five star review. The general manager was awesome in apologizing and assured me that she would receive some coaching on subtlety and proper behavior.  That really makes up for it. My greatest fear was that it was a given that if you're a woman in Autozone you're going to encounter condescending employees. I really felt like he was concerned and wanted that to not be the case.  Thanks for caring, AutoZone!

Literally the best.   Always have free samples and are willing to skewer just about everything they own on a toothpick for you to try.  This is a good first step if you dream of having a good relationship with a butcher like all those TV chefs do.

Headed in today to check out their new efforts on bulking up the anime and manga collection.  Staff was awesome and helpful. They are still rebuilding their anime goods and manga collection now that they have 50,000 square feet of space to fill.   Manga seems to be hand-vetted and carefully selected, in addition to varied. Full Death Note series, Bleach, Naruto, and Scott Pilgrim box set shared the shelf in harmony.   Have never read a comic book in my life, but have purchased several things from here:   1. Giant Stuffed T-Rex (Squishables, 39.99 each) 2. Japanese Candy 3. Japanese knick knacks and assorted kawaii-ware.   Comics are obviously their bread and butter, but stop in and check out their cool selection of non-comic related purses, stuffed animals, pens, pencils, candy, t-shirts, and used video games.   You definitely don't have to be into comics to enjoy the place!

Everyone has a project they've bookmarked and thought about doing. Come here and grab some supplies, and actually do it this weekend. Why not?   Inside is nothing short of an upholsterous meshacopia of bargain fabrics canoodling with high-brow silks and leathers.   They have stretchy. Stripey. Fluffy. Fuzzy. Silks, ribbons, lace... even hot pink satin for that classy-flavored Quince√±era dress you've been threatening to make.   Bins full of broken button families torn asunder and separated forever. Good luck finding a match.  I enjoy their boxes of .25 scarves, stacks of interesting felty sheets, and counters full of things that would creep me out to find anywhere else (bin full of tiny plastic naked infants, anyone?)  All in all, this is a great little place.   P.S. In case of emergency, wear your Sunday best as their air conditioning rarely works well and you risk falling dead of heat stroke.   P.P.S. If you forget your Sunday best, call me. I've been meaning to learn how to make formal wear.

Everyone point and laugh at the nerd reviewing a convenience store.  Oh yeah? Stuff it. Like donuts? Check this out.  Get in your car and drive here around 3AM and try their donuts. Had every single donut place in the area, and nothing can hold a candle to the QT donuts.   My guy begrudgingly takes me here every couple of weeks for the donut stake out. It's so worth it.   They get hard during the day, so seriously - 3AM or bust.

Just got back from this year's Matsuri festival, which is in its 20th year!   Plenty of vendors selling everything from Hello Kitty to manga to bonsai trees. This year is a little smaller than previous years, but go with an open mind and a sense of adventure and you'll be pleasantly surprised by what the vendors have to offer.  If you're on a budget, do yourself a favor and just go to look. When you find something you genuinely like, ask the person working the booth for a card, or where their store is located.   Nearly all the participants are here in Phoenix or have a website where you can buy their merchandise, and it won't be marked up for the festival.  Stop by Roka Akor and pick up their card for a complimentary appetizer!

Stayed here for a week as a perk of my job.   Had a small spread of gourmet food buffet-style food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner the whole week.  I loved their orzo salad and their incredible breakfasts. Eating breakfast outside on the patio is recommended.   The grounds are beautiful and overrun by adorable hares. They were everywhere! I also had the pleasure of spotting a couple turtles hanging out.   Hotel was very accommodating when I asked for my office chair to be replaced. They also brought in plenty of drinks and candy when I let them know I had a sweet tooth.  I still miss the quiet walk to breakfast across the sweeping grounds as the sun was rising. Very peaceful way to start the day.  It's more than comfortable here.

On Cinema Suites*: If you are of age with no children or in a group full of adults, do yourself a favor and upgrade. Five stars for this experience.  With no children, you can eat comfortably and get engrossed in the movie without the unexpected jolt of a baby crying or a parent snapping at a kid to be quiet.   The smaller and more intimate setting with fewer seats and better chairs translates to comfort. I loved the fact that you can recline with your feet up and still use the large tray. To those who complain of not being able to eat when reclined, this isn't Rome. Sit up when you eat, and lay back when you're done. It's good for your digestion.  *Fork and Screen and Cinema Suites are separated by a wide, wide ocean of class, ambiance, and comfort. This review completely ignores Fork and Screen because of how bad it is.

First time trying this place with my guy, and when we got there it was dead. Beat the rush by going in a little earlier than you'd like.   We politely asked for a few minutes, and the guy proceeded to just stand there. Staring at us. Waiting. Not looking away. I explained that this was our first time and we need a minute to think about what we need in hopes that he would at least smile and tell us to take our time. Nothing. Just stood there and stared us down until we ordered*. No pressure.  The second staff cheerfully brought us our meal with a pleasant smile and really warmed the place up. This guy seemed to be the grill man, and I'm not sure why they don't put him at the cash register.   My food: Regular burger with no cheese was room temperature and needed a little salt for my taste as the inside was completely unseasoned and unsalted, only the tops are sprinkled with grill seasoning it seems. Fell apart trying to hold the weight of so much mayo. Sweet potato fries were also lukewarm but delicious and mushy.   His food: Garlic Mushroom Swiss burger was passable but like other Yelpers said, these mushrooms are waterlogged and canned, never having seen a grill in their miserable lives. Chili cheese fries were the star of the show, piled high with steak chili and liquid molten nacho lava goodness. Hot and fresh, seasoned well.   Notes:  -They DO deliver from 11am to 2pm. Call first!  -There is outdoor seating (2 tables), should you want to sit and eat while being serenaded by the sounds and smells of Central Ave traffic.   -The inside seating is tiny, and while the atmosphere screams family, you will not be comfortable eating here unless you're a party of two. Their take-out service might serve you better.  -If you're going for the first time, I suggest either the Mexican Burger or anything buried in chili and cheese. Can't go wrong, and wash it down with sweet tea if you're so inclined.  *For those wondering if that guy was just in a bad mood, I've been back once since then and he also stood there silently staring me down until I ordered. He is the silent, staring spirit that still haunts Lenny's to this day.

Food's good, but I reckon Lenny makes his cashiers spend their breaks poking each other in the eye.  Why else would all the cashiers be in such a bad mood?  Peanut butter chocolate milkshake is the only reason to come back.

The pastas are a hit - the carbonara is covered with the angriest, most intimidating chunks of bacon I've ever seen. Cheesy smokey bacon heaven. The garlic breadsticks are yummy, too.  If your service sucks or you have a bad experience, try tipping more. This holds true to just about any restaurant.   Behold the power of the 30% tip.  To recap: I know no one that works here, have only ordered here 4 times, and they treat me like a close friend when I call.  My food gets here incredibly quick (20 - 30 minutes when they quote an hour) and they usually hook me up with free delivery and little odds and ends they think I'd like (free mozzarella sticks, some breaded mushrooms).

Was robbed outside at 8pm in front of the store in the parking spot closest to the doors. They took everything and bolted.   Learned that this Safeway literally has no cameras outside, their camera on their front door can only capture who goes in the store, and there is no security.  Thanks, Safeway.  Also, they have a good bakery here, so I guess it gets two stars.   Come in and have a fresh cinnamon roll after you've been robbed.

The girls were awesome, and I kind of wish I lived in their waiting room. I took my laptop and worked for the day in their desk area enjoying their big selection of Keurig coffee, tea, and hot cocoa.   They're really expensive, but I don't mind paying more if it means I'll be treated like an intelligent woman instead of a dumb broad like at other shops.

It's all in what you order. The previous two ice creams I've had were not palatable. I could not finish my items.   Third time's a charm (I don't believe in giving up!). Ordered a vanilla milk shake with peanut butter and hot fudge mixed in with a cheesecake on the stick for later. Both were just right.   I'll keep coming back here in case there are more flavors I like!  P.S. They had Maine Lobster flavored ice cream here last time I went.

Choose for the free delivery, not the food quality.  If you are stuck working through lunch and neither pizza nor chinese sound good, consider this little place.  The food is good, fresh, and perfectly edible. For 6.75, you can get a half sandwich and big bowl of soup. A large soda is $1 more, and you can throw in a cookie for 75 cents.   My ladybug club sandwich was fresh and cold on store brand wheat bread. Ask for the bread to be toasted if you want a more substantial texture and mouth feel.  My potato cheese soup was hot with potato slices in it, comfortably bland, and incredibly filling.   Soda was crisp, bubbly, and not watered down at all.  Cookie was the star of the show - melty chocolate chips and soft center.  The food all together reminds me of something your mom would make you for lunch if she was in a hurry but still loved you.   Service was warm and friendly - add this to your list of choices for delivery. Skip if on foot!

This is a great street vendor experience: The food isn't bad, the place is open until shady hours of the night, and the location elevates the experience of eating a hotdog from boring to feeling a tad dangerous and cool.   Nogales Hot Dogs makes eating hot dogs feel dangerous and cool. That's reason enough for you to go.

Lucky to live across the street from this little place.   This is a bookstore best enjoyed if your schedule is wide open and you're merely browsing for something new. If you're looking for something specific and widely available, order it online.  Great atmosphere, tall ceilings, and that incredible musty book smell that always makes me think of The Neverending Story.   Comfy chairs, friendly staff, and adequate lighting.   Trade-in is rather low (15 - 25%), but you should really think of it as giving your old books away for free, and them giving you a nice little discount as a thanks. Stop being stingy - share your old books with the world.

Recently visited and smelled the peculiar smell that other reviewers have mentioned.   Boldly asked what gives to the guy running the store. (nicely... "sir, what IS that scent, and where can I buy more? I love it!"  Found out every time he works, he burns sickly sweet eastern incense.  I wish he wouldn't.

Two hippies, your brightly colored insides make me want to fight The Man, but your pizza makes me wish you'd call The Man and set up a proper fresh ingredient exchange before we take him down.   This review, in all its five star glory, is for everything on the menu but the pizza.  Wings are gigantic and look like they came off some sort of mech-sized chicken monster. They absolutely drown them in sauce, which is so right. My favorite are the medium wings and the ranch sauce wings.   Pasta is out of this world. Drop everything right now unless you're holding an infant - you want the lobster ravioli. Note, you must actually like lobster. The sauce is creamy, basily, parmesany, and delicious. The garlic bread that came with it was silly and messy, and the salad they include is a green afterthought.   Cannolis are sweet and crunchy with the perfect softness and infused with that oh-so-gentle lemon flavor that pairs well with the chocolate.   Which brings us to the pizza. I was excited, nay, invigorated when I saw your bold decision to put french fries right on top of a pizza. When you topped it with hot dogs, I felt my heart skip a beat in anticipation of struggling to beat later.  But alas... The pizza is topped with canned veggies and loveless toppings. It tasted and made me think of food from a school lunch. If you insist on the pizza, I'm guessing you should keep it simple. Their adventurous pizzas are all talk.

Not a coffee snob and I don't wear scarves or own a "fixie," so take this review with a grain of regular ol' table salt.  Atmosphere is small and pleasant, and they predictably had some nice indie-flavored muzak. The outdoor seating looks really pleasant, but Indian School and 7th Street doesn't do much to provide a view.   Girl working there was awesomely friendly, but a little disappointed when I ordered an iced coffee.   She kept waiting with a wishful look in her eye that I might add something to it, some undiscovered new twist or challenge for her to make to order. I get the feeling that the staff here is rather bored with coffee - if you or someone else you know has a difficult order with way too many adjectives, get them down to Urban Beans. They're hungry for the challenge.  Iced coffee was decent, average priced. Four stars for the friendly staff and great atmosphere.

This place is tough to miss - Head south on 16th St from Osborn, and it will be on your right. Like another poster said, if you hit Thomas, you've gone too far.   I just got home from my first time here, and I couldn't be more relieved that I chose this place instead of the ritzy one by my house. It may look a little humble on the outside, but this place will become your holy grail.  Interior is bright, well-lit, clean, and hectic on a Thursday evening at 6:15pm.   I had the basic pedicure, which was 17.00 flat today. I think it's 15.00 on Mon - Wed.   The basic pedicure came with a total of around 45 minutes to 1 hour in the massage chair. The light is rather bright, so many girls were wearing their sunglasses to really zone out and enjoy that massage. You can also ask for a warm towel to throw over your face!   The pedicure included the initial foot soak, careful nail clipping, snipping and shaping, cuticle pushing, moisturizing, 3-minute salt sugar scrub, additional calf massage (around 3 minutes), lotion application, hot towel treatment, and light foot massage with oil and lotion.   Also purchased the 5.00 callous removal to reverse some serious high heel and flip flop damage. She worked beautifully and carefully making sure not to hurt me, asking often if it was too intense. This came with an extra massage!   I opted for a light blue/light pink plaid design over a grey for a very subtle preppy look. Executed perfectly and with a steady hand - could not have asked for better. She treated my toes like they were her own!  My total was 24.00 for the callous removal, pedicure, and design. You will want to tip well!  It's worth noting that they close at 7:30pm; I was still mid toenail clip at this point, however, and she told me that it was really no big deal at all. At other places, they might rush you, but she really did take her time and work patiently. I know that if I had needed anything else, they would have stayed there until 9pm if that's what it took.

Coffee was ok. Not great.  So here's the thing. I went in and ordered an iced coffee with milk and vanilla flavoring. The girl taking my order was friendly. I was friendly. We had this whole friendly VIBE going on.   She passed my empty cup to the second girl making the drinks, who accidently dropped the friendly vibe on the floor and stepped all over it.  She gave me a coffee with no vanilla and no milk, and half full with ice. As I stared dubiously, hesitantly, I asked her if that was mine. She confirmed and walked away. I asked nicely if I could have vanilla flavoring, milk, and a little more ice, and I apologized for being difficult.   She told me that she would put some vanilla in it for me, but I could use the room temp milk that was behind me on the coffee condiment bar.  I told her that I'd rather have fresh cold milk since there wasn't much ice, and she said she would have to check and see (?). She put a dallop of milk without asking what percent i'd like or how much, slammed the lid on the coffee, and turned around and went in the back.  Beware the unmedicated sirens of Tully's.

Honestly, my visit there was perfect.  I'm not a foodie, and I've never tried this type of food before. My mom was visiting, and was lured in by the smell of grilled vegetables and spices.  The service was really great, friendly and sincere.   We both had the veggie kabobs with a side of the pasta salad and beans with pita bread.   I was wary about what kind of side beans and bread would make, but it was delicious. Flavorful and really comforting, especially on that pillow-soft bread.  Pasta salad was a really interesting new direction for me with its feta cheese and shell pasta. Not what I was expecting, but surprised in a good way.  The kabobs stole the show, mushrooms being our hands down favorite.   The soda machine is the coolest thing I've seen done involving a drink, topping the previous winner (drinking soda out of a Sippasaurus).   Chocolate chip chunk cookies are huge, soft, chewy, and wonderful. We're going steady now.  I really recommend this place! Thanks for showing me and my mom a great time.

Decided to order from this place when they hand delivered very nice menus to our door.   ORDERING PROCESS: Very good. While there's always a little difficulty speaking and being understood to non-native English speakers, the friendliness and eagerness of my order taker was excellent. I called (unknowingly) 5 minutes before closing, and offered to order elsewhere. He assured me it wasn't a problem and urged me to order anyway.   DELIVERY SPEED: Very good. From the time I hung up the phone to the time it was at my door: 14 minutes.   For those wondering, they do ask to see your card at the door. Make sure you have it ready.  FOOD QUANTITY: Bountiful. I ordered the 6.99 order of orange chicken expecting one of the larger white take out containers that fold at the top - the traditional chinese food containters. I received a huge styrofoam clam shell container packed with orange chicken. They also included extra crab rangoons and it came with a medium-sized container of fried rice (egg).   FOOD QUALITY: Decent. This food will not appeal to the culinary snobs, but it will fill you up with hot food that tastes decently good.   Chicken: Orange sauce was good, not spicy and not saccharine sweet. Flavorful without being overpowering. Chicken breading was soft and fell off chicken often. Actual chicken pieces are good quality and good tasting meat.  Fried Rice: The weak point of the meal. Rice lacks substantial flavor but includes egg, carrot, and perhaps the occasional rogue pea. Vegetable to rice density is very low. You'll likely have two bits of carrot and one pea to a box. Rice is moist, warm, and chewy with a slight nutty flavor. A touch of the orange sauce boosted the flavor and made it delicious.  Crab Rangoon: Very thin. While most Cheapinese places serve puffy crab rangoons, these are paper thin and almost resemble a baked appearance instead of fried. Filling was plentiful and flavorful.   PRICE: Total price was more than affordable. With spending 6.99 for a veritable banquet of food, you will be pleasantly surprised by the quality.   They offer 3.99 Rice bowls featuring one serving of chicken over their rice. Perfect portion for lunch.

I needed a quick place to stop for coffee before a work obligation and saw Oink from the street. Always looking to throw money anywhere but Starbucks, I made both a sharp turn and new enemies in traffic to get my ass there.   No wait to be seated, I took a seat out on the shaded patio and grabbed a maple bacon donut and a latte. Donut was warm and covered with a Ron Swanson worthy amount of the crispy bacon. Latte was yummy!  They showed me a menu and it all escalated so quickly ... suddenly I found myself in front of eggs, home fries, and two strips of the monthly special, Pecanwood Glazed Bacon.  I would put a baby in that bacon. I'd make an honest woman out of that bacon. You get the idea.   Order your home fries extra hot as tiny potatoes don't insulate themselves very well. The food was awesome and the service was CRAZY FRIENDLY: warm, but without the zeal of a used car salesman.  Eat here! Get bacon!

Unlike others, I don't take off a star for service unless it affects the quality of my food. People in the food industry are always in bad moods and I give them wiggle room.  Did anyone else know these guys deliver? Delivery charge is $1 if your order is under $15 bucks and free over that. They have a 5 mile delivery radius.   Ordered two times here now - Pastrami delivered, NY Steak in store. Both were very good.   The Pastrami gave me no surprises. The steak was not strips of steak but rather thinly shaved steak if you're wondering.   The Pastrami took 25 minutes from call to doorstep delivery. It was still hot.   Good quality subs, prices seem fair. Their bread tastes a little more "artisan" than Subway.
