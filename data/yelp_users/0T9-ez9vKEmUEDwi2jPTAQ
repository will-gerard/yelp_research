Great spot. Super affordable and tasty lunch specials. I had the carne asade chimi and it was way good. Great chips and salsa too.

I went in at 4PM to use one of their industrial paper cutters to cut four large photographs down to size.   Woman at the counter: "That'll be $1 per cut." I said no thanks. "Oh, wait... you can use the paper cutter upstairs." I said thanks and walked upstairs. No paper cutter to be found. Woman (from downstairs): "Oh, you know what, we're getting ready to close so we put it away. You can come in tomorrow."   Nope.   Further, they close at 6PM. You mean to tell me that you spend the final two hours of your shift "getting ready to close" and putting away a paper cutter that you refuse to get back out for a customer to cut four sheets of his own paper. I live in the neighborhood and it's disheartening that my local print show is so illogically opposed to helping customers. Won't be coming back.

This place is amazing. It was eight bucks for an 11-inch pizza with all the toppings that I wanted on it. Super good pesto, fresh mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes and spicy sausage. I was pretty surprised when I walked in that I was the only one there. I really hope this place blows up because it's freaking delicious.
