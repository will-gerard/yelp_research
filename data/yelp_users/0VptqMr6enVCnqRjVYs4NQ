I wish this update was for a bump up to 4 stars, unfortunately it is not. If I had written this Friday night and they didn't offer good vegan options it could have easily been a 1 star review.  The funny part of this saga is I had completely forgotten about my prior review which had to do with Pizza Heaven figuring out orders with different toppings, charges, etc.   Recently I have been complaining about how expensive Z pizza has been getting, Pizza Heaven's location is closer and I thought would be cheaper so here goes; round two.  The order: 3 topping large pizza with vegan cheese, on their menu listed for $17.50. When I arrived to pick up the pie I was told " That will be $27.?? " What?!?! "No, I just had a 3 topping pizza, just one...nothing else".  This is where the discussion began on how they charge for toppings, apparently their policy is to rip people off? I think we all learned in the 4th grade (ok maybe not) if you put 3 toppings on one half and 3 toppings on the second half you have used the same amount of toppings for the pie - the toppings may be different yes, but the net amount of toppings used (and might I add purchased by the establishment) is still the same. Since my girlfriend can't stand onions, and I hate those little black olives we each had our own side of 3 toppings each BUT...get this....were charged for 6 toppings! Recap: no more toppings were used total on the pizza but because they were all different apparently they have made it a policy to charge for 6 toppings. The vegan cheese was also an extra $2 but not listed on their menu online (or at the restaurant).   They ended up comping me for one topping and I didn't throw too much of a fight because I knew I would not be coming back anytime soon. Once I got home and tried the pizza it did nothing more then seal the deal. It wasn't the worse pizza but it was mediocre at best.  I don't feel great about writing this review, I really want to love and support independent businesses in Phoenix but when they have crazy policies like this and I have to spend $27+ to get a large mediocre pizza I need to draw the line somewhere. Phoenix has very few vegan pizza options but right now it seems like the corporate giants win again - I can get a large surfboard vegan pizza at Whole Foods, with any 3 toppings on any half, which tastes great for $15.99; no hassles.  Lastly I would like to comment that the girl working the cashier was very friendly and very courteous even though I was displaying clear signs of being utterly appalled. Even when I left she was still very friendly, it's safe to say she saved this from being a one star review, kudos to you.

My last review was hard to swallow, it wasn't something that I particularly liked doing. Having said that, I am proud to say I can't possibly give Pizza Heaven anything less then 5 stars now. This is why:  Two days after posting my last review, I was contacted through Yelp by the owner. She had even found my phone number and email address and contacted me there as well, after I didn't respond promptly she tried me again......it was evident she wanted to make things right and talk about my experience at Pizza Heaven. Over the next two weeks we discussed the issue and she apologized more then once and explained what had happened. We talked a bit about the compromises and challenges to running your own business and I found out all about where she sourced her Vegan cheese from, how to order other items Vegan at the restaurant, and about a new vegan sausage she was trying. Suffice to say that the owner cares immensely about her business and her customers. If all owners cared this much we might have a real dining dilemma (does Yelp exist in a society if every place warrants 5 stars??).  I am happy to say that the owner made things right to my satisfaction (and then some) and I am also eager to let veg heads know about the new Vegan sausage - its pretty damn good. I have gotten two pies since my last review (sausage and green pepper) and they have been much better.  I am glad that Pizza Heaven is now back on my pizza rotation. I am even more thrilled that we have owners like we have at Pizza Heaven here in Phoenix.

If you eat in sushi does still take awhile on occasion. The service is usually decent although not overly friendly either.  They have decent vegan options and I must say the portions are rather large. When we wanted a basic tofu/rice/veggies bowl we started getting take out here rather then Pei Wei or other pseudo asian joints because; it's cheaper, it tastes better and for under $6 you get a large bowl that is plenty for 1.5 meals. I have never even gotten the "plate" size because the bowl is always so large.   I usually get the brown rice bowl with fried tofu, add veggies and the curry or chile sauce. Once in awhile I will mix it up and do noodles instead which is good as well.  It's a decent place to pop in for a drink and a bite to eat, sometimes can get busy but it's good to have places like this in the neighborhood (plus it's not a chain - bonus).

Uhhh...when is this place open? I can't find hours anywhere and for a 3rd time we tried to go here this past weekend and again.....not open. WTF?!?   I am a Vegan living in Phoenix and need to get in here! It's wrong that I have not been here at least a handful of times but everytime we have tried(Friday evening, Saturday afternoon, Thursday evening) over the course of the last 6 months it has been closed.   It got 2 stars instead of 1 because it's a vegetarian house in Phoenix, nuff said.  Maybe someone will read this and open this place espcially for me so I can stuff my face and change my review to 5 stars, that is what I am hoping for anyway.

Did someone actually refer to the salsa as Ketchup?! Oh hell no!! The salsa and chips are by far the best I have had in the valley. I was surprised this place got such mediocre ratings. I have been going here since I moved to the valley and it's always reliable.  The location is great because it is so different from anyplace else; Mexican or not. Tucked back of 16th st in a more residential area, the patio is great and there is always room even when it's busy.  The service is always good and then there is the chips and salsa. I don't see how anyone can knock it, it's always fresh. The more pico inspired salsa is chunky and has a good amount of cilantro. The hot red salsa is more of a paste but more authentic and delicious with some heat. The flour tortillas chips are always warm and delicious. Most of the time I load up on chips so much I just get a Tostada and a beer or house margarita.   When I used to eat chicken and dairy the chicken chimi fundido was something I always went for. I get the veggie burrito on occasion now but that isn't anything great, it's got plenty of veggies but nothing to write home about(if my home was in Mexico). The veggies in it aren't what I think of when I think Mexican, it has carrots, cauliflower, etc in it. No peppers, onions, etc.....oh well.  I would just give it 3 stars if I didn't love the chips/salsa and location/ atmosphere so much. That bumps it up a star in my book.   Salsa is like ketchup? Seriously? Sorry...I can't let it go.  Oh yeah, for awhile in 2008 every time my girlfriend and I went here it seemed there was always a wedding party, high school reunion, or other annoying large group gathering. In 2009 we haven't seen as much of it but be warned, you can usually still dine, but half the place is reserved and you have to deal with horrible band or MC music and exhaustingly obnoxious people.

Buffet's bring back bad memories. You wouldn't expect this, but growing up in rural Maine, the "big city" consisted of 30,000 yet somehow we managed to have more then a handful of glutton inducing Asian inspired buffet's. I am talking mega buffets, and I use the word "inspired" loosely.   Luckily Pink Pepper's lunch buffet is nothing like that. I am still somewhat skeptical about multiple parties digging into the same troughs full of food sitting out but whatever; live life dangerously.  I hit Pink Pepper every once in awhile with coworkers for their lunch buffet. The service is always prompt and friendly, that atmosphere is not tops but its not bad and always comfortable.   The lunch buffet is about $8.50 and they always have a handful of vegetarian/vegan items. Spicy eggplant, spicy tofu, spicy noodles, crispy tofu and vegetables, are just a few of the great dishes that are usually at the buffet. I don't get the feeling that this is the most healthy fare, but it's not overly oily either. It's also maybe not all authentic but it's close, and it's all very tasty and consistent.  We just went in this week and they have stepped up the buffet a bit more for 2010. They had fresh bowls of chopped scallions, cilantro, etc to top dishes. They also had a plate of veggie spring rolls and two different kinds of new peanut sauces to try with them and/or other dishes. These simple additions really show they are trying to enhance the buffet experience as much as they can and that's refreshing.  I can't comment on dinner but if you don't feel comfortable with the lunch buffet at least give them a shot with dinner.

Ahhh.... Whole Foods, John Mackey's little baby he has turned into a behemoth within the industry. I am so torn by Whole Foods, of course most everything is more expensive. This could stem from when Mackey started the business as a democratic socialist and was not making any money, yet people were complaining about pay and high prices so he then turned into a free market libertarian - you can blame your high prices on that if it makes you feel better. Mackey is also a Vegan, but has said if he didn't sell animal products it would be bad for business(if the business even existed), yeah I get it, but I don't like it. Does anyone even care about the innard workings of the company CEO of the store they love/hate? Ok I'll cut this short.  This Whole Foods is an older store, not the real old school hippy-esque store, but it's nothing like the newer flagship stores around the country(like the one on Mayo). This obviously means they have to cut back on their selections to a degree but they still do a good job of cramming everything into this much smaller, albeit more "quaint" store. If I go to the Mayo store I am gone for 2 hours but only come back with a bagful of stuff because I was lost in a trance "browsing"; this makes my girlfriend very angry.  I don't buy all my groceries here because I don't think some things are worth what they charge but in all honesty you can only find certain things at Whole Foods that you can't find anywhere else(Trader Joe's, Sprouts, Sunflower, etc). The Vegan/Vegetarian selection is massive compared to those other stores, they simply carry all the latest and greatest - it may not be the cheapest, but they carry it.   One last item, and this is for pizza loving vegan fools - Whole Foods was one of the first places to carry Daiya cheese. They actually sell shredded containers of it in the refrigerator section, but they also have it available at the deli. The usual counter worker isn't that friendly which is a shame and always seems put out but that doesn't make the pizza any less tasty. You can get one of their "surfboard" pizzas which will feed 2 for 2-3 days with a couple of toppings with Daiya cheese for $15.99. This may be the best deal going at Whole Foods and make up for that $8 bar of dark chocolate you just bought.

This isn't much of a place for the "expierience" but the cheap eats and decent food paired with fast and efficient servers makes this an easy 5 stars.   They have a few items you can make vegan, the Gyro lunch special is great. You can get just the Gyro for $5 or make it a combo for $6.50. For that you get a nice pita wrapped around some of the better falafel in the valley with lettuce, tomato and tahini and a good portion of a side of fries or other side of your choice.  It's not the best I have ever had but compared to other Falafel offerings in Phoenix, which are downright horrible at times, it's pretty good.   The service is always friendly but not overly bearing and the servers are usually always the same people at lunch and they are always on top of things and now whats up. The food comes out fast so it's great for a quick lunch spot while still getting sit down service.

We first tried this place late last year, it's right down the street from our condo and we were itching to break away from the norm and try a new place.  I am always thinking I might find the next "it" place that no one else has discovered. I know Julio's has been around for awhile but I had never heard anything good/bad about it.  It probably didn't help the start to our dining expierience that an ex-manager/co-worker came into the dining area when were first sat down. Let's just say I pretty much disagreed with this person on every aspect of life and leave it at that.   Service was slow, very slow. It was a lazy Sunday and place was not even half full. They finally brought the meal and it was wrong, we waited another 20-25 min and I think part of it was wrong again. I don't even remember what we got it was so forgettable. Just blah, it provided some calories and nothing more. Everything was just bland an so-so.   I gave them 2 stars instead of one because they did comp our entire bill. I felt somewhat bad for the waiter so I left him a big tip and got out of there, so much for trying a new place.

This is a favorite lunch spot for me. You can customize the veggie burrito to be vegan and it's not bad. I would give the burrito itself 3 stars, but you get unlimited chips and salsa from the salsa bar for FREE and who doesn't love free unlimited chips and salsa?!  On a few occasions they have goofed up the order so vegans beware, more beans would be nice in the burrito but overall it's decent and something different compared to heading to Chipotle, Rubios or Baja Fresh (plus, these guys are local!).   They have a nice patio for when the weather is accomodating and enough staff and seating so that at lunch time service is always good and speedy. Give it a try.

My first review on Yelp(I am way overdue) and it undoubtedly has to be Green. My first venture to Green was actually before I was a Vegan, I had just transitioned to trying vegetarianism and I thought " Wow, being a Vegan is easy!! " Well not exactly, but Green helps - unfortunately not all Vegan food is as creative or tasty.  Green isn't a health food place but some of there items are better for you then others. But you can be sure you are not getting a stack of cholesterol/saturated fat and animal protein to give you years of bad health and interesting diseases (yep I said it).  Pretty much everything is good at Green, I can only think of one so-so meal I have ever had and it was a special.  I am convinced it was not made correctly in the first place. The Spicy Po'Boy sandwich was my 1st and 2nd meal at Green and still a favorite, all the burgers are good, pizza is decent, bowls all taste similar but are all great. Appetizers are cheap and all good(try the hummus, non-wings, crabless puffs). Tsoynamis are incredible. Most of their specials are good, and don't forget about Green on holidays when you feel like not eating an animal(like the majority of folks). July 4th this year had an excellent spread and all for $5(which went to charity of course).  I forgot about the location a long time ago, yes the strip mall is nothing special and unsightly but who really cares. The atmosphere inside has improved over the years and all the people who work there and go there all seem to be quite chill(even the meat eaters). I just wish there was a second location closer to me in North-Cen Phoenix(maybe someday)  Phoenix doesn't have a ton of Vegan restaurants, but this place rivals other Vegan restaurants in much more Vegan friendly cities. My one complaint(or hope) is that someday they won't have to call things "mock chicken" and "mock beef". I know this is to appeal to the masses and most people even in the Vegan community could care less but TVP, Seitan, etc all have a unique taste and texture and should be celebrated for that and called exactly what they are. "Wheat meat", " Veggie meat", "soy meat", whatever. Animal "meat" doesn't have the bounty on the word meat, what do you call the innards of a coconut or avocado? Ahhh now you get me, ok end of rant.  Go to Green, Carnivore or Herbivore, or anything in between, for the good food/atmosphere. Keep coming back for the reasons of why Green exists at all.

I was going to give ZPizza 4 stars then I started thinking....why not 5? I have never had a problem with service, staff is always friendly, pizza is always good with little inconsistency, they now have the killer of all Vegan cheeses.....Daiya so why not? Well, 5 stars is reserved for someplace or thing that you cannot live without. If it were to go away, or you were never able to have it again, then your life would somehow always be one notch below what it could be.  I am not sure I feel THAT strongly about ZPizza, but then I realized if I gave it 4 stars I would be the first non-5star review for this location! I can't bring that kind of Karma on myself! 5 stars it is!!  The Soy Berkley Veggie pizza is really all I ever get, it's a great pie for sure. I like mine with wheat crust and lightly baked and most of the time Zpizza does just that. The buy one get one free Tuesday deal is something we hit frequently, I understand that it's going away and will be replaced with another customer appreciation deal but really, I am surprised it has made it this long. It was quite the deal.   The Soy cheese used to contain Casein which doesn't exactly make it vegan friendly. Most all stores now have switched to Daiya vegan cheese(which isn't soy but actually made from a root). It's the tits(see what I did there? Tits is a hot new word for describing something top notch, but tits is also what dairy cheese come from, this cheese doesn't; so you can stop thinking about a cows tits and where your dairy cheese comes from, clever I know) The cheese is fantastic, Whole Foods carries it for there pizzas too.   I have had there yuppie veggie sandwich before as well ( I was really hungry and had a pizza and sandwich if you must know) and it too is good. The pizza at Zpizza might not impress pizza snobs looking for authentic Sicilian, Brooklyn, etc pizza but the pizza is good and creative and uses better ingredients then most places, therefore actually making it somewhat good for you(ok, it's still pizza but I am trying here).  I haven't been to ZPizza in a few weeks and after checking there menu it looks like they have made a few changes, my Soy Berkley pizza now has a new name and new ingredients. I see some other changes as well, change is good, I am not mad(NOOOO!!!!). Time to see what new pizza creation I can put together, the addition of new and healthy ingredients can only help.

So after my latest frustrations with ZPizza I contacted management. I explained the situation and after an initial email I received a follow up. They didn't give me free pizza for life(guaranteed five stars) but they did give me a small discount on my next pizza which we ordered that night to see if things would change.  I was told by management that they had new cooks and the online ordering I guess is not as straight forward on their end as it is for the customer so we called in our order last night.   I am happy to report the pizza was pretty much perfect, not missing any toppings, a decent amount of toppings, etc. I am not sure the price was right but maybe their prices have gone up, even so I appreciated that management actually got back to me and that I can enjoy Z again.

Ticoz is very close to a 5 in my book, which is tough because I am a picky, whining vegan(well at least that is the stereotype I am trying to live up to). They have quite a few vegetarian options that can be made vegan if you know how to order it.  We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for our very first dining expierience.  It was fairly nice and warm out so we opted for the patio, everyone was very friendly and we were seated promptly. The place was not super busy but most everyone was on the patio and I liked the vibe. We saw others sucking down mimosa's and mojito's so we thoughy why not? We each ordered a glass of the passion fruit sangria - it was excellent. You also get a LARGE glass of sangria, not a small wine glass or cocktail glass they serve you in a more inferior establishments.  I had checked some Yelp reviews quickly(don't you love Yelp mobile?!) and figured out the corn waffle fries were a must to start with, very tasty, fresh and not the typical thrown-in-a-fryer-frozen taste.   I had the Grand Burrito with veggies minus the cheese. I am not a big coleslaw fan but the burrito came with the passion fruit slaw and I promptly scarfed it all down, delicious. I was expecting the burrito to be good but it was good in a different way, you could tell it had some different spices and seasonings going on then your standard Mexican-style fare. I might have picked up some curry or coriander, whatever it was in the yellow rice it really set the burrito apart.   Overall this place was great, no complaints besides maybe a few more items I could veganize without completely destroying the items. We will definitely be back for drinks some evening. The prices were pretty reasonable, between the two of us and our main plates, appetizers and 3 HUGE glasses of sangria the bill was just under $50. Bingo.

This review is for just the wedding service and dinner. I can't comment on whether this review would be the same if I dined there but I need to give them some credit where credit is due.   Sooooo........our friends are getting married. We RSVP as typical vegans, hacking up the menu/plated dinner choices to accommodate us(would you expect anything else)? We get asked a few weeks before " are you sure you really don't want cheese? " Uh...yeah, we're sure.   Sassi probably isn't the type of place we would normally ever go. We don't mind finer dining establishments but the place is like a huge Tuscan compound in the middle of the desert. Speaking of desert, even though the location if far from most everywhere, the Troon/Pinnacle Peak area is some nice acreage. I can see some people really loving this place and I will admit it all is done very well and is impressive, just not our thing.   Onto the wedding dinner, our cards were color coded with a "jewel" based on our dining preferences. You got the beef tenderloin it's black, chicken blue, eggplant purple, of course ours were pink for "the difficult, PITA, vegan meal someone has to make". I was honestly expecting for something to be wrong and/or a complete  miss and that we would be stopping at Taco Bell on the way home. I was really prepared to go back to the kitchen to show and tell the chef " see, this is how EASY it is to prepare something Vegan ". None of that happened.   We got our first course, salad. Everyone was pretty much getting the same thing and one of the servers attempted to put one in front of me but the other server dude said "NO...This is a VEGAN" and proceeded to give me my veganized special salad. Wow, I felt so special. This guy was like the vegan Nazi, no animal products were getting near me if this guy was around!! Second course came, pasta,  and it was excellent as well. It was obvious there was no cheese on ours but the server even made a point to whisper to me that this pasta is vegan as well. I would never expect it not to be but it was a nice reassurance. Third course we were expecting a veganized version of eggplant parm but they ended up pulling out something completely different. It was a silken tofu, crusted in some nuts and a sweet tangy sauce with some vegetables and couscous on the side. It was a complete shocker. I don't love silken tofu but it was pretty darned good and a nice surprise.   All in all everything exceeded my expectations. I wonder if they would be this accommodating if I was a dinner guest? I am not sure, I looked at the dinner menu and they don't have lots of options but maybe I should give them a shot. If the vegan Nazi is around I am sure he would take care of me.

Yes this is a chain, oh well. Wei has a good selection of options and the food is always fresh.  Service at this location (which is new to me) is always prompt and courteous.   It's Asian food from a chain so don't expect to be blown away but is this really why anyone goes here? It's consistent as you can get and doesn't break the bank for a good portion of food that can also be relatively healthy.  My only qualm with Wei is that many of the dishes taste alike. Whether I get the Thai Dynamite or the Spicy Korean the flavors, spices don't vary that much - both are still decent dishes though.  At 878 walkable yards from our place it's the closest Asian food takeout we have and I am ok with that.

I still haven't decided whether I like Chipoltle or Qdoba better; it's a close call. Either way you can get a huge  vegan burrito for under $6, how can you complain about that?  Bonus for Qdoba is that their pinto beans are Vegan(Chipolte's are not). I usually grab rice, black beans, fajita veggies, corn, hot salsa, lettuce, gauc - done. They also have some veggie tacos and another grilled veggie burrito but I usually go for the staple above(make it more healthy with a bowl, no rice, double black beans).  The service is usually friendly enough and consistent. My family and friends in the far reachs of Northeast New England long for Qdoba - I am not sure if I would go that far but it satisfies this Vegan.

Disclaimer: The 5 star review is based on a baseline for the average Taco Bell which frankly isn't the most highly prized food establishment.  I would say only 50% of the time they get my order right and I don't make a habit of eating there but sometimes it's cheap and easy for this vegan.  After getting dragged into work for a 14 hour emergency day on a Saturday I was seriously hungry when I finally left the office shortly after midnight. I have had this experience at this particular Taco Bell once before but had long forgotten about it. A few cars were in the drive-thru for some late night nosh, when I pulled up the speaker boomed:   " AND HOW ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT? " " THAT"S FANNNNNTASTIC!! " " WHAT WILL YOU BE DINING ON THIS EVENING?"(I am paraphrasing).   The window/order taker was a riot. I entertained him back an forth, when I ordered a Tostada(no cheese) and a Bean and Rice burrito with no cheese his reaction was " MMM, That sounds delicious! " After 14 hours staring at a computer this put a smile on my face. When I got to the window part of the act was over but they guy was super friendly and honestly looked like he was having a good time.  Lot's of people treat fast food workers like they are second class citizens and I haven't figured that one out yet.  If someone can work a late Saturday night fast food job and to put a smile on a customers face while keeping sane then he is a better man then I.   To top it off, he had my drink, bag of food,and fire sauce ready and waiting. Uber fast and friendly service. This guy(and late night crew) should make the rounds to other establishments. They could teach the places that charge $9.99(rather then .99) for a taco a think or two.  Hit this late night drive-thru for great service and some comic relief.

I frequent this location the most, but during softball/kickball season we are at Camelback location more often. Both rate about the same in my book as far as service and food is concerned.  We always get the veggie burger which comes with fries or onion rings for only $5.95. The veggie burger is always good, for a non veggie restaurant(sports bar at that) it's damn good. They usually have decent beer specials and some games on as well.   Sometimes the crowd at this location is strange, I can't figure it out. Mix of douche-bags, Scottsdale moms and kids - def too many kids. Camelback location has a better crowd and patio by far.  This location is 3 stars for me but it gets four because it is a sports bar with a fine veggie burger for less then $6.

Every Thai place I always get the same item(at least once). That makes comparing much easier. I always get the Spicy Basil w/Tofu and brown rice(if you don't have brown rice then you get deducted at least a star and DON'T tell me brown rice and white rice are nutritionally the same, really? Read a book! ). Sometimes I throw on a side of steam Broccoli for good measure but not always. Sala is the closest decent Thai place to where we currently live so I would say we frequent Sala more then any other Thai place in the Valley.  We get take out 50% of the time and eat in the other times. Only once can I think of that the order was jacked up at all(no brown rice). Usually service is quick and no hassle. Food is quite consistent, sometimes the vegetables on the dish change, but it's always a surprise and works so why not!  They have the typical decent veg/vegan selection and will do a fish sauce replacement(plum I think) if you ask. My only minor complaint is that sometimes the heat level is not consistent, I like it HOT but Thai Hot some places is HOTTTTT, other places its just mild. Usually if I ask for hot, it's a good level but sometimes it is off(usually weak).   I won't say it's my favorite Thai place in the valley but it is in the top 3 for sure (at least top 5...yeah top 5) and I have given them plenty of times to disappoint.

So I know it's cliche`, when talking about a certain ethnic dining establishments, to refer to the food as " it's good, but not as good as indian food in India! " Although lame to say all the time, in some cases it is true. I have been to India and the food was probably the best thing about the trip, seriously. Luckily India Palace does a pretty good job - for being in Phoenix, AZ anyway.  This is on my lunch rotation as it's close to the office. A few of us hit the buffet every once in awhile and I must say it's always very consistent quality wise. while changing up the menu items every time we dine.   The buffet is small as others have mentioned but I think this has an appeal. I feel it helps keeps the quality, flavors, etc consistent and everything fresher. They always have more then a few vegetarian and vegan items to fill up on and service is always prompt and friendly.  This place is easy to miss tucked back into a hard hit(read lots of open, leaseable space) strip mall in NW Phoenix but worth stopping in for some almost-authentic indian grub.

I was not sure what to expect with this place but I told my girlfriend they had Vegan donuts and on a rainy, cold Sunday in Phoenix it seemed like the perfect time to drop in.  Pulling up and entering this place I felt like I was in Eugene, OR. This place seems like it SHOULD be in Eugene(if you have ever been there you know what I am talking about). It's great it is in Phoenix, but I did not know places like this existed in this desert city, just Eugene.  Things are casual, I get the feeling that everyone crammed inside knows everyone else - but they don't know me. Sometimes I felt like people are staring at me, judging, maybe because I was wearing a Helly Hansen slicker(it was cold and raining, I don't get to wear it much) and that was against their ideologies, maybe I was just paranoid, I don't know. I am a vegan, trying to get my degree in Sustainability from ASU and buy shit off Etsy, etc so don't give me that "look" ok?  Of course they are out of Vegan donuts....errr.... they did not even get any that day? The friendly dude working lets us know about the Vegan Breakfast Burrito, what's this you say?! Bingo. It was a long 10 minute wait and I was not expecting much but it was actually very good. Came with tortillas chips and salsa all for $6, hard to beat that. The salsa...wow....out of everything here I was not expecting to be blown away by the salsa but it was good!!! Tasted like Carolina's salsa so maybe they just ripped them off but whatever, kudos.  I almost forgot the best part. While we were waiting for our burrito some lady was going off about cereal. Something about the marketing, colors and how they pushed the toy but then the toy you got sucked, etc, etc. It was quite the anti-corporation rant and was quite interesting, albeit hard to keep up with - I think she had one too many  cafe latte's.  I definitely want to come back here to try out the vegan donuts and also I didn't get to check out  the "library" in the back which seems very interesting. The place was a bit messy outside, I guess they could clean it up some but I don' t really think anyone gives a f*ck and why should they - stick it to The Man.

I am responsible for Fresh n Easy. Ok, well that is stretching the truth a bit, however I DID participate in a focus group for the naming of the store. We were given a whole host of names, word triggers, different concepts and were fed bits of information as we went. Some of the names people finally decided on were super sucky - my final pick was not however Fresh & Easy, I had decided on just  "Fresh" as I didn't think it was trying to hard to describe what the store was about and left a little to the imagination. They went with Fresh & Easy, their loss.  This is probably the least aesthetically pleasing F&E that I know of in the Phoenix area. They get a star back because they reused building space in a strip mall that definitely needed it. It's also 2 min from my new home so it's my "Neighborhood Market" by default.  I don't like all the packaged produce but I "get it ".  It does appear that they use minimal packaging but still seems like a lot of plastic. Lots of the F&E brand stuff is pretty decent and priced well (like the hummus). They have super cheap tofu and they carry Gardein products for veg heads which not too many places do. Oddly enough you can also find interesting ethnic items here too that you won't see outside of an Asian grocery (certain brands of Rice and Soba noodles).  I can't go here and get EVERYTHING I need, but I can't do that at Trader Joe's either so it's a mute point. They have Amy's Frozen No Cheese pizza for less then $6, any grocery store that carries it locally (Safeway, Whole Foods, Fry's) it's $10 or more; which might I add is ridiculous.  Finally, I LOVE LOVE LOVE that all the aisles are self checkout. I see a trend at other stores to REDUCE their self checkout aisles, that is asinine to me. Their scanner/check out stations are the fastest and work better then any other self check out register I have been to. Why does that matter? Because I can get my shit and get out. Even if their are a few technologically challenged people (or just challenged in general) there is still always an open station for me. At other stores I always run into waiting in LINE at the self checkout because the person in front of me can't figure out how to enter a quantity for their avocados, or weigh their bananas, or just how to scan and bag at the same time (I know we are supposedly the most intelligent species but it happens).  Never change your model away from self check out. NEVER.

So I gave Fresh Mint another try Friday night. My girlfriend got the Golden Soy Chicken, I got the Kung Pao. Service was great and friendly as usual. Another bonus is that brown rice is not more! Everyplace now charges more for the "unmolested" rice(if they even have it) and it's ridiculous.  Both dishes were great, the portions turned out to be perfect. Everything had good flavor, the Kung Pao was weak heat wise for me but will be perfect for most.   The only reason this does not get 5 stars on my update is that it is a Vegan Thai/Vietnamese/Whatever place on the Phoenix/Scottsdale line with high end LA Vegan place prices. My Kung Pao was $14 dollars. It is one of the more expensive things on the menu but I had gotten other things and they had just been ok.   If prices were a tad more reasonable then this place would be 5 stars for sure. I understand people need to make a living and you don't go into business to not make a profit but think of other Vegan places in the valley and their prices.

Chakra easily gets 4 starts in my book because if I try to access the website at work it is blocked - "The Websense category "Supplements and Unregulated Compounds" is filtered." You know it's got to be good stuff if it's filtered at work, all the best stuff is filtered at work.  Onto the cafe...  I should really visit Chakra more often. It's actually healthy Vegan food, usually when I head out we are going for more of the junk Vegan food variety but for 2011 maybe I will make some changes.....maybe not.   The food is great, I had soup and the their version of a quesadilla. Everything had great flavor and wasn't heavy on anything besides the good healthy stuff. Place is very chill and waitstaff was great.  My only complaint being that when I entered I was not sure if I was supposed to seat myself or wait to be seated. I stood there for a few minutes like some protein deficient vegan moron and subsequently got ignored a few times till I finally just asked and was seated. Also, everything appears to be healthy here and they make it a point to tell you on the menu, yet they also make it a point to exclude ALL soy products but they have dairy products??! What?! Ok, not all soy products are created equal and there isn't much concrete evidence surrounding this great soy debate anyway. You won't lose me as a customer but I wouldn't mind if there was some organic tofu or tempeh on the menu either. Just know I am laughing inside that you are including dairy products but excluding soy and I will drop it. In total I guess that is two complaints.  Don't let my minor annoyances discourage you (most of my annoyances are relateable by .5% of the population), this place is solid with solid healthy food. I would not give it 4 stars if it wasn't. Go eat and enjoy.

Usually I want to love places like this but can never find anything useful, practical, or tasteful. I don't want to collect stuff(I don't really love) for the sake of simply helping a local business. Practical Art has helped change my perception.  Guaranteed you are not going to love EVERYTHING but I found more then a handful of items I actually liked(or loved). We were there looking for a wedding gift for a friend after refusing to buy into the generic Macy's gift registry list that was offered up. We ended up leaving with something for ourselves but will be back wedding gift shopping in the near future. The very friendly and helpful person working that day also told us they did gift registry if we wanted to send our friends in(ugh yeah, that might be tough).  The best part of our experience is when we checked out they didn't try to shove a plastic/paper bag down our throats - in fact they didn't even have any. Awesome.

Too long.......it took me way too long to make it to Sens. Sens is what we need more of in Phoenix!  Seated promptly on a Friday night by Johnny Chu himself, Johnny Chu really has put together a winner here, Johnny Chu.....alright, I admit it...I like saying his name!  The Asian tapas idea is new to me, having dined at some great Tapas places from Chicago to Vegas,  but alas never an Asian tapas joint. I must say no Spanish tapas place ever made me feel like Sens did (except the time I drank a pitcher of Sangria)!  The Tofu dishes are amazing. How do you learn to love Okra? Get it at Sens. The Hong Kong rice noodles were not what I was expecting so I was a little taken back by them looking like a plateful of water chestnuts. One taste was all that was needed to cure my trepidations about the flavor - fantastic!  I will be back to Sens Tapas & Sake Bar soon - do you think you could invent an "Asian Sangria"? C'mon Johnny, I know you can do it!

Woah! What the f*&^ happened to Pita Jungle?! When I first hit this new location I was worried, something is going to happen, and it's not going to be good. Service down the drain? Higher food prices? Different menu?   So far so good, although the decor has changed and the clientele is slightly different from other locations. You don't get that hippie, earthy, organic vibe at this new location. The decor is modern, they have a bar, it has high ceilings and lots of dining space - all these things are different from pretty much every other PJ location. I like it and I hate it at the same time, partly because lunchtime at this location its full of wannabe Scottsdale mommies "eating healthy" and drinking at noon(nothing again drinking at noon). It's really about the food though and that has not changed.  You still get large portions for a great price, the menu is the same. Service is quick, not that same hippiesque, brotherly friendly service at other locations but it's still not bad.  The Jalapeno-Cilantro hummus is still the best. The 1000 bean pita is huge and for less then $7 - you can't beat that. The hot veggie pita is great and on my last trip I had the macro platter which was excellent.   I hit this location because it is closer to my workplace now but I still like experiencing how PJ got started and hitting the original Tempe location or even the Shea/Scottsdale locale. The great thing is that all have consistently good food, portions and prices.

I have visited Scramble many times since they introduced the vegan menu items, which is why I was surprised I had not reviewed them. Scramble is getting 4 stars instead of 3 because I truly appreciate the effort to offer vegan items and how they responded to vegan inquiries. Having said that, a few minor things continue to bother me:  1. I feel like the tofu in the vegan burrito isn't really seasoned anymore. It was never heavily seasoned but I feel like it's gotten a bit more bland and sometimes appears like its just plain tofu heated up.   2. I feel like the tortilla would be better if it was grilled a bit. It seems kind of chalky and cold when I am wanting it to be browned and slightly warm.  3. The soy chorizo is a nice addition but it's kind of close in texture and consistency to the tofu so it all just blends together. Something like some veggie sausage or tempeh bacon in with the tofu or as an option would be a great.   It might seem like I am complaining but lets face it, you don't have many vegan options in Phoenix for breakfast. Ironically that might be why I am not impressed as much now as was forced to figure out how to make a mean vegan scramble and vegan breakfast sandwich at home for all these years, so maybe I have just had more practice and now I know what works and what doesn't.  The sweet potato hash is still fantastic and was a knock out addition to the menu (for vegans and omnis!)  I still dig the decor, it's always clean, the service is good, the bathrooms are nice and the consistency issues seems to have gotten much better. Scramble would really be an easy 5 stars in my book with some more attention to improving the vegan selections. Maybe I am asking for too much but I am a vegan and we like to whine and complain a lot so there!

Soy Coconut Latte.....FTW. I can die in peace.  We finally made it here, we are moving to this hood soon so I wanted to see what will soon be a short bike ride away. We only got lattes, and then snooped around the marketplace so I can't vouch for the food...yet.  I am so glad I read Amber W's review or I would have never known about the elusive Soy Coconut Latte. It's not apparent right away what flavors you can have in your latte so I asked and eagerly awaited my coconut delight. My girlfriend got a vanilla latte which she said was good, then she tried my coconut latte. Holy hell, I haven't seen her express so much delight or get that look on her face in awhile(sad right?). I agreed and spent the next 20 min slowly savoring every last drop.   I love the cups, the material and design keep in the heat and it doesn't require a sleeve - plus it just looks cool. We browsed around the store a bit, everything is impeccably organized, tidy and clean. They have some good stuff that we regularly include on our weekly shopping list, albeit most of it was at a higher price. They carry some local items(Simply Bread, Salem's hummus and pitas, etc) that are hard to find anywhere else, although again they are slightly higher in price.   I love the open air concept, the people all seemed great. I see people complaining about the parking, maybe some days it is a problem but really people need to get over the typical Phoenix strip mall:  HUGE massive parking lot out front with stores set far back off the street. It ruins the aesthetics and appeal of the store front and isn't as inviting. I will be biking and/or walking here soon(as others should try to do as well) so parking becomes a mute point. If you really have issues with the parking park in the huge abandoned parking lot west of 16th st and walk a couple hundred yards - problem solved.  I didn't see too many vegan items, lots of gluten free stuff but no bakery items or section marked as vegan. I also didn't see much on the menu that was vegan either. I was secretly hoping that since it was called "Healthy" Marketplace it would have more(hasn't anyone read The China Study" ?). A few more vegan grocery and menu items and this place would easily be a 5 in my book; this area is desperately in need of it.  I am not sure which direction Luci's will head, the marketplace is a nice idea, but I am not sure I could see myself buying much in the way of staple items. I could see this place maybe expanding on the cafe and seating and maybe going towards more of the specialty market(read things you CAN'T find anyplace else). I am excited to see where Luci's ends up in the future, I will definitely be back for the coconut lattes and hopefully to try some menu items(I can give you some great vegan ideas - I need a breakfast/brunch spot with options!)

Yay my first 1 star review!! I didn't die after dining here so maybe that's a bit harsh but that's just how I feel. This place just plain sucks. Granted I didn't try much on the menu, no meat, no seafood but judging from the other reviews it probably would not have mattered.  I probably never would have come here but I got forced into going with a work group for the obligatory birthday celebrations. I usually try to avoid these because the short list of where we end up usually includes Olive Garden and TGIF. Meh.  I had the asparagus rolls and sweet tofu sushi(Inari). I had to load the tiny little asparagus rolls with ginger, wasabi and soy sauce to give them any sustenance. The sweet tofu was missing some normal ingredients I was expecting, the tofu pouch was mushy and cold. I snuck some vegetable tempura off a plate of a coworker and even that was not anything great - how do you f up Vegetable Tempura?!  The biggest issue was when I got there I asked for water. When the waitress came back asking if I was having anything to drink I said just water. When the meal was over and I asked if I could get a water she came back 5 min later with nothing but the checks for everyone. Awesome.   The Teppanyaki guys were pretty good, I will give them that. I don't know how everyones else meal was and frankly I don't care. I lost 45 minutes of my life and $11.25 I will never get back. Saynara Ah-So.

Let me start this review by getting a small rant out of the way, stick with me here. I understand people who are not vegan come here, some enjoy it, some don't. What I don't get is people spending half their review talking about how much they love meat, dairy, dead things that used to have a mother, etc :-). It makes you look like more of a jackass because you are lauding it at a restaurant that is explaining why to go Vegan all over the walls and TV!! Yes, I am a Vegan, but don't tell me I don't "understand", I was an omnivore for 28 years who used to eat lots of all kinds of meat, cheese, dairy and NEVER ever considered going Vegan - that argument doesn't fly with me. If you are interested there is a wealth of information out there so get educated. It's a process for most(like me) but a rewarding one and you might just surprise yourself. I am always willing to talk to anyone about my "experience" as what most of society would call me " a non traditional vegan".  Anyone still reading? Ok good, now onto Loving Hut. This review is really more of a 3-3.5 review but since it's a new vegan place in Phoenix metro it gets a 4 in my book. I think they could do much better in a better location, CenPho anyone? That being said, I work close by and this section of N Phx seems like anti-vegan land. So the fact that I have a 100% vegan place to go for lunch in this area is a bonus for me, although I am constantly going there alone since none of my coworkers would ever set foot in such a place(see "jackass" comment above).  Most of the food here is decent, the eggplant and tofu is a good dish with a side of brown rice. The BBQ sandwich is also very good. I enjoy most of their apps as well, I had the Hawaiian burger once and wasn't that impressed - I make a better veggie burger at home(probably healthier too). Don't mistake this for health food, but its better then your standard meal at the local Chili's. Let's face it, people don't go out to be as healthy as possible, everything in moderation though(well not EVERYTHING).  The staff is always very friendly and the prices seem reasonable on most of the dishes. I would rather create a Vegan meal at home then drive here for dinner, but for lunch when I need it, it works and I enjoy it. I hope they stay around and in business, I wouldn't be heartbroken though if they moved to an area where a vegan establishment might do better.  PS. They changed the names on the menu since they opened, I am not sure what prompted it but its a good change. I don't like any vegan places that includes the animal they are trying to imitate. Vegan food can stand on its own, soy, wheat, etc protein can stand on its own. It has its own flavor, texturee and benefits it doesnt need(nor should be) compared to something else. I get that calling something soy "chicken" helps with getting people to transition to the diet but call it what it is, soy meat, wheat meat, nut milk, nut meat etc. Animal by products don't have a monopoly on the word "meat" or "milk" or "cheese'. Kudos for the menu changes.

I already loved Hula's before even stepping foot inside. I am a sucker for for anything modern, yet quirky and isn't afraid of using a colors besides various shades of "brown" .   That being said, my rating may be slightly influenced by the night as a whole rather then Hula's alone - is that allowed? Ah f*ck it, here goes.   The first visit to Hula's was a celebratory dinner/drinks with our realtor/mortage broker after a marathon short sale that finally closed. Needless to say we were ready to drink. Too damn hot to sit outside but the patio seems to be where it's at. Started off with a double Mai Tai, it was strong and tasty. The menu has lots of veggie/vegan options and we had some sweet potato fries and wakame salad as apps, both great. One double Mai Tai down the hatch we got some edamame, now all edamame is pretty much the same everywhere I have ever gotten it but this was amazing! I should point out that this was after 1.5 STRONG double Mai Tai's but the edamame had some spices on it that really made it stand out.  For dinner I got the Jamaican Jerk tofu which was simple but very good. After reading all the negative reviews on the food I wonder if I have such an underwhelming sense for decent food or everyone else is just plain wrong - jury is still out.  At this point in the evening I realize my girlfriend who is 1/2 my weight has kept pace with me and consumed the exact same about of Mai Tai's as I have - uh oh, this could get interesting. At this point we decide to head to Vertigo (if you don't know what it is then you aren't cool enough to know). Half the group doesn't make it there or passes out in a random chair while I hijack the hosts Itunes account to get some decent music playing. The night ended with a barefoot walk to the nearest light rail station and a ride home. What's my point of telling you this story? The drinks are strong, it' a fun place to meet up, and those two combined can really make your evening.   Oh, and they have good food, yeah i said it.

How can you not give Total Wine 5 stars?! Outside of Yelp I have heard from friend's ( I don't really like them) complaining; muttering something to the effect of "it's not that impressive". Are you f$&king serious?! Where else can you find the selection AND at great prices without having to be jerked around into getting a club card?! Where else can you find as many craft brews from all over?! Organic Vodka? Yes! They have always had every brand I have gone there in search of(even the elusive Christiana Vodka which I have never seen ANYWHERE else for purchase)!   Ok,enough with the questions marks and exclamation points, the facts are they have the biggest selection and the best prices. They blow Bev Mo and Costco out of the water. People always ask me if it's REALLY cheaper then Costco, well it is....... consistently(plus you have to drop $50 just to shop at Costco).   We usually hit the Desert Ridge location(that was my first intro), but have been hitting this new Camelback location in CenPho and we like it. It's a good spot and it's probably the only store that sells alcohol that you could spend over an hour in giggling like a child.   Enjoy responsibly.

This second location is closer to us then the Thomas Rd location so bonus star for that.  The food seemed consistent with the other location, portions, spiciness, flavor, everything seems to be a duplicate which is a good thing. I usually get some sort of tofu and basil dish or tofu and eggplant and it's always great. Hot is Hot (as it should be).  Not sure I love the atmosphere inside but there is nothing wrong with it, for some reason I don't like the tail ceilings here even though normally I would see it as an improvement to the space....oh well.  The portions at Tottie's are large....does anyone else think this? I always have a to-go container which is fine with me.  Sometimes Asian fusion goes wrong but I can't see anything wrong with how Tottie executes their dishes.

Yelping a gas station? Sure.  The only reason I would think to Yelp about a gas station/convenience store is because I like to give Kudos for service and originality where it's due(even if it is subtle in this business category).  QT builds behemoth gas stations by most standards. They remind me of the Sheetz stations on the East Coast, aside from that here are the top 6 reasons why I am Yelping about a gas station and giving it 5 stars.  #1 Their gas is consistently priced low (I have to buy premium and it's always .20 more then regular, never more)  #2 Their workers are efficient, fast and friendly. It must part of their business model and hiring process. The cashiers can actually multitask and ring you up in less then 30 sec, always with a greeting and a good-bye.  #3 If you are looking to try out your mixologist side on some sugar laden soda, this is the place( I don't drink much soda but every once in awhile I will whip up some Diet Coke with Lemonade and a splash of cherry)  #4 They have free air!(for your tires, all other gas stations usually charge .50 - $1.00...ridiculous)  #5 It's always clean(well at least for a gas station)  # 6 All QT locations are a Safe Place. What this means is that youth in trouble can come to any QT location; a store employee will give them a safe place to hang out, something to eat and drink while they call a Safe Place coordinator to help resolve their situation or provide additional support. It's a pretty small thing but with a major impact for the individual in need.  Now, this is a glorified gas station. It could be better but present day, you can't ask for much more. I am hoping in the future its a place where we can phase out traditional oil and I could charge my electric car here or fill up on alternative fuel. More vegan snacks would seal the deal too....hey, a guy can dream.

So happy that That's a Wrap moved north and closer to me, thanks That's a Wrap! Expanding there hours was genius, we need more spots like this in CenPho for lunch AND dinner.   Digging the new location and small patio space, the employees seem even more cheerful and friendly then before (if that is even possible).  This is a great spot for a vegan bites, you can customize pretty much every wrap and SURPRISE - it still tastes good!   The Ken and Barbie-que with tofu is awesome. Senorita-no-meata sans cheese is great as well, I've never had a bad meal here - EVER. You can sub grilled tofu on any wrap, bowl or salad. Nothing much else to say besides don't change a thing!

Never been to the original location but was happy to see this spot pop up in the "little-strip-mall-location-that-could"; just a hop, skip and jump from our home.  I love the modern decor and the patio space. The service was very friendly and the food came out fast. The veggie burrito actually had more on it then I was expecting, it's simple but had lots of flavor for sure. I am still not sure about the salsa, it was different and had a nice bite but might take a bit to get used to.  All in all I am very happy we have a vegan friendly Mexican spot in this area of Cen Pho that has good food and service.
