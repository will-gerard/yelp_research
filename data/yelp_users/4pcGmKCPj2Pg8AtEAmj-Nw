The Arizona Roll was FAB!!!! I also loved the miso soup and green salad, that dressing is delish. Not to mention a very cool environment.

Would not recommend coming during their lunch rush. Amazing food. HORRIBLE service. Dont expect to be able to ask a question without a nasty look or snotty answer.

I called with excruciating pain.  I was immediately offered a same day appointment which blew my mind.  I was not able to do the same day so I was scheduled early for the next.   From beginning to end my appointment was effortless.  Dr. Johnson, Tricia my hygienist, the dental assistant and the front office team were friendly, comforting and professional.  I left with a clear understanding of my treatment and the costs. As well as a clear picture of what would be needed in the future.  The overall cost was much lower then anticipated as well, which is a nice surprise.  I left with little pain and peace knowing I was taken care of and would be in the future

My husband and I found this place last week while on a run. Excited for good authentic mexican food we thought we give it a try. Glad we did. I was not a fan of the rice or chile relleno BUT the beans. OH the beans and my husbands tostada, beef taco and enchilada with red sauce (which I got a bite of all :-) ) were delicious. Only being a mile away from home we will definitely come back. I love small family owned businesses and this is exactly that.

Quaint lil place. Great service. The beans and beef taco are delicious. Not a fan of the rice or chile relleno. I'm definitely coming back. It is a small place so food takes awhile but that's to be expected I think. Very enjoyable.

Food was average Service by our waiter was poor. The manager came by and did great. I Had high hopes for it since it had a similar menu items as my fav pasta place that closed called Pasta Pomodoro. My husband ordered a "traditional neapolitan" style pizza that was soggy. I ordered the gorgonzola pasta which should be a tangy gorgonzola cheese cream sauce but it tasted like Alfredo.  When asked for coarse black pepper the waiter did not even know how to use the pepper mill and she brought our drinks (beer and wine) 10 min after we got or meals. Not sure if we're going back. We might give it one more try after they've been open longer.
