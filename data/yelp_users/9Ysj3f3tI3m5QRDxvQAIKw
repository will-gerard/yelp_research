slow service. The banana blueberry bead was so so. Rolls were so so.  Sushi wasn't bad, not awesome. Service was total poops.

I would giver this place a negative rating if I could. I was having some brake trouble last week. When I would depress my pedal, it would go to the floor and glide to a stop, without locking the wheels. I was told to go to just brakes. I went and immediately they tried selling me extras that I didn't ask for. I ended up paying 300 dollars fr new pads, shoes, calipers, and a fluid flush. You'd think," oh my car would work after that much",. They even have someone who test drives it before you take it, but low and behold my brakes were EXACTLY the same. I went back the next day and had to argue with these dolts over why my brakes aren't different and why if I'm paying 300 dollars it should be. I finally got them to cover the labor the piece they thought to be the issue. The main cylinder apparently needed to be replaced, but god forbid they check that with everything else in the first place. Now I'm waiting for a part to arrive that I had to pay for just so I can use my car. Further the second time I brought the car in and dropped it off so the could look at it, the BROKE MY IPOD. The buttons were off of it. I immediately complained about it and they tried to blame the sun and continues that "no one had driven the car". I replied, "then how did it get in your garage dip shit?". No one apologized still for it. It this doesn't deter you from here I don't know what will.

i pretty much loathe buffalo. I rarely find anything worth buying and when I do its no cheaper that if I went to the actual store. They staff isnt great in all senses and the music isnt very good. They only buy things you would be looking to buy anyway, and if they do choose to buy something of yours, they dont pay nearly as much as they sell it for.

I love the Town and Country. Theres only one problem with it. It has hardly anyhting there. Everythings pretty much gone. It all started when the movie theatre left and everything pretty much followed. I don't see why noone want to go in there since is such a lovely place. Poor town and country...*sniffle*

I love Cost Plus. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is it tends to be a little expesive and this definitely stands for the furniture. I love the food section though! They have decent posters too...

Boo bestbuy. You are a major inconvinience for me. And your employees are brain dead. I only like the fact that you are close to my house, but that sorta doesn't count anymore because Circuit city is now closer to me. You know best by, your not the best and maybe I don't wanna buy from you anymore! Why don't you put that in your back pocket?

I like safeway because they are always nice clean and helpful. THe only reason it isnt 5 stars is you pay more for this treatment, but I say it is worth it. Also they tend to have the better produce.

I love going to this place for lunch. They are well priced, always friendly and have decent food. My favorite part however is the fact that they serve tea with the meals. Its a great place to go with a few friends.

I hate buckle almost as much as I hate Juicy Coture. Its just wishy washy angsty "teen" clothing thats like emo skater with an edgy rebellious flair, but not really cause your shopping with your mom for back to school.

Nothing says midlife crisis like this here joint. It just reeks with stale testosterone. And great corporate branding I should add- with hip naming like that your sure to catch all the hot 18 year olds you can get- so long as your back doesn't go out Champ!

I love ZInc Bistro's enviornment. Its beautiful. I HATE the Service. And most of the food is meh. Be advised if you go in for just some espresso's with friends you will get  treated poorly by your server. They aren't very cheap either. I usually avoid going there mainly because I feel like punching the servers square in the face there.

I just went in here to use the restroom and all I can say is eww. The entire bathroom was filthy: no soap, no paper towels and the locks  on the stalls are missing. Also no mirror at all. just gross. This for me reflects the workers and the food which is just eww...

The only good thing is the cheesecake. The food is terribly mediocre. And I hate how they seem to all be decorated like ruins of some sort. I want some damn food not an expedition with Fernando!

To sum up the Biltmore Fashon Park all I can think of is Mediocre. I dont even think it deserves that capitilization. Its just a big facade with nothing in it. Immagine looking at it from above.... its just a shell of stores surrounding crap. You've got Borders, coffee plantation, Macy's (although if you want to know how I feel on macy's go ahead and read that review...) and not much else. And while it IS hilarious to make fun of shoppers from Chico's, it doesn't count. What makes it truly sad is it has potential to be a cool place to hang out, but it falls short in that there is nothing open past 9 if you're lucky and it is "under remodeling construction" which makes it displeasurable to even look at from the street right now. yuck.

Pretty much the most amazing highschool to exist EVER. no joke. Its the only highschool that allows freedom in exploring the arts. You could say "what about ASA"? ASA what? ASA is a sad excuse for an arts school. Just check out metro's site metro-arts.org

This is probably the best place for a sweet tooth. They have a large variety of fresh ice creams to fit everyone's fancy. Just don't eat too much and get fat! Mommy wouldn't love you then. Oh yeah they also have a drive thru now.

This place isn't too shabby. They have decent sushi and other items, but they don't have smoking sections... I mean I know that thing is GOING to pass, but not YET as of this review. The staff is interesting to watch when you drop a piece of edamame on the floor and watch them all seemly race to get it, but it is like a spy race where you aren't supposed to notice, but you totally can and the winner gets a cookie.

Now I have never gone in here for anything other that cigs, but they overcharge for those so I dont like them.They also had a poor selection of them (only for kinds I think) That and the biker theme is somewhat scary.

I hate The Hub. It is just obnoxious. It all like "I wanna look like I have nothing, but wanna pay through the nose for it!". I mean the brand Deisel alone makes me irritated. It so "I hate my life! Its so hard!". Also the staff prertend to know the product, but if you ask enough good questions you'll find they know nothing more than you could have deduced. Eww. Yuck. gag.

Its official. Neiman Marcus is in a horrible slump in men's fashion. Sure you can get a nice suit, but where can't you. They never have any decent designers no matter how many times you suggest it to the managers. Every walk into the men's section is a slap of midlife crisis in your face. just nasty.

I'll be honest. I don't like this place at all. its not that good if you ask me. And not that cheap either. I know there are plenty who like this place, but I think one can do plenty better. When I went in the hosts/hostesses were occupying the entirety of the bar allowing only seating at the tables.  If you could manage to pull one of the twits out of the circle you can get waited on, depending on what your standards of waited on are.

Urban Outfitters is a Scenster's paradise with all the "sorta 80" clothes one could want. Don't get me wrong, occasionally they have SOME neat stuff, but I dont want to pay 5x its value. They have a small men's section which seems to be the case with all stores. The Scottsdale Waterfront location is even worse. If you MUST go to one of them choose the mills Ave one.

This place is really cool, but it has a couple problems: 1) its right on central and we all know central is one hell of a bitch to drive, that and its hard to find  and 2) it doesn't have as spansive of a menu as I would like to see.  sorta 3) too dark during the day. The type of lighting's cool in the evening and night, but during the day it makes me feel like I'm doing a drug run type thing (not to to say I've done so, but its how I would imagine it)  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the music though. The staff was also very friendly.

I like going here because if you look hard and often enough you will find a fabulous deal. It is pretty much always swamped though with plenty of crying babies and people in general so bring an Ipod!

Willow house is architecturaly charming, however it has no other redeeming qualities. They coffees are ones you more or less settle for. Pasteries as mediocre as the people who go there- all of whom are scenesters. It could be nice if it weren't so scene. That and perhaps better coffee.

Delux makes good burgers, but you probably figured that out already. They also have good fries (sweet and regular potato thank you very much). They are kinda expensive. If I have to compare it to something I would compare it to California Pizza Kitchen. Better than a regular Pizza, but probably not worth the cost.

It gets the vote as being the best library in Phoenix, but then agian it didnt have very good competition. I only dislike the employees about 50% to 75% of the time. At least they usually have what I am looking ofr I suppose.

I would give it zero. I don't understand how this can be a brand. they dont DO anything. their clothes have NO design touch to them at all. You can't even count the colors since they do every color so they dont really have to think about that either. I'm sorry but 50 bucks for a boring cheap hoodie just isn't worth my time.

I love Ikea. Its just goodlooking cheap furniture. Which is excellent for me since I change my mind about stuff so fast, it wont cost me an arm and a leg to decorate that way. I also love their Lingonberry Jam and Swedish meatballs. Oh Ikea you only have one problem. Tempe. Wy must you be in Tempe? Why must it be that everytime I go in you I must see some rotund mormon mother waddling around in her demin jumper gone shapeless dress? Why must you be a day trip? Its okay though... I forgive you Ikea.

I've been going to Unique since I was little.... when it was called Chic n' Cheap. I always find at least one decent thing at Unique. Granted it doesn't have tons of great stuff, but it is a great stop on a shopping day. And this isnt a psudeo thrift store that more of a vintage store and therefore can charge non-thrift prices. I'm talking shirts under a dollar. yeah.

This place has been in the valley since my Dads family first moved here and it has always been delicious and reasonably priced. It's best to order your food and pick up later however since the resturant tends to be quite noisy. It is Definitely worth the drive (glendale area).

Hands down robeks is the best place to get a smoothie. They are clean, friendly, and fast. If you don't know what to get, I recommmend the Pomegranite Passion Smoothie.

I had my transmission replaced here and 2 months later it went out again because they installed it improperly. They tried to then make me pay for labor to replace it! After I threatened with a law suit they said they would cover their work, but It has been three weeks since then. ABYSMAL COMPANY! WATCH OUT! Did I mention that they haven't even started working on it in that 3 weeks?

This place is amazingly good. I love going here. The only bad thing is its in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale which can be a bitch to navigate. Trust me though its definitely worth it. They have many types of teas and I personally love the toasted Foccacia Bread with 3 spreads. Uh! Thinking about it is making me extremely happy!

OH macy's... the only reason I give them an extra star is because I want to host their Thanksgiving Day Parade. What can one say about macy's. Its not exactly the pinnacle of fashion for anyone in any sense. And its definitely not the place to find a bargain. And they have their own brand called the Charter Room. That just makes me irritated for unexplained reasons. YOU LOOSE MACY'S!

This resturant is like right down the street from fashion square sorta. A long ways down that one street but yeah. Its the big monsterous resturant on the corner near that Frank Lloyd Wright Tower deal-ie bug. Yeah so they are kinda expensive and while they offer portions that are overtly large, I found it bland and not so good overall. I wouldn't really recommend it at all... unless I don't like you then HAVE AT IT!

Let me set the record here. Juicy Couture is NOT COUTURE. Its two dumb bimbo girls who thought they were bing cute by making sluttly over-priced jogging suits with juicy embriodered just so on the ass and who acknowledge that they 1) don't really try 2) definitely dont do couture, but make a "joke" out of it (i dont see how it is a joke but whatever) and 3) they are essentially trashbag, dimestore, raggedy-ass hoes.. It is T-R-A-S-H-Y. This applies to all locations and divisions of Juicy. It is an abonination to the Fashion World.  by the way velor is disgusting... f.y.i.

I am more familiar with Utrecht from when I was in S.F. ,but there is a location here in AZ. They seem like any other art supply sotre, wexcept I have a discount card that goes into addition with my student discountso I prefer them over others. Otherwise they are like any other art store I suppose. Maybe some better prices on certain things tho.      wow i am really retarded I mean to put the name is as ARTS... wow I'm tired...

Their great don't cha know! Not only are they unknowledgeable of what to do in any given situation, but they also always do the wrong thing. Only one word comes to mind... DOUCHE... I guess thats why they are in Phoenix...  Now if you yourself are a police officer, this isn't necessarily against you unless you are the douche who took my license plate off of my vehicle without proper and valid reason. I am going to find out who you are and get you fired you sorry excuse for an officer.

I love this place because they are the cheapest place to get you car washed. You can also get detailing done there too so its multi faceted. I think its 3 dollars for a basic wash tho which is nice.
