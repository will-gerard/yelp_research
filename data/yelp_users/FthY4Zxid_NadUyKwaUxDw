Nothing special about this food at all. A person I work with highly recommended this place for their bean and cheese burritos. Also, there have been some ranting raving reviews on Yelp about how awesome it is. What-everrr!   I ordered the bean and cheese burrito and 2 tacos. When I got my food, the order was totally wrong, with like sausage, and all this other strange stuff. So when I got the correct food I ordered, it was no big thing. The bean burrito was just a bean burrito, and the tortilla was sort of hard to bite into, stale I guess. The tacos were okay, they were the el carbon style like you get at any California taco truck.   I traveled super far to eat here too because it was supposedly so great. Maybe people just aren't used to great Mexican food in AZ. It was just a dumpy little place, kind of looked like an old Taco Johns or taco bell from the early 80's.   Next door, there was a fortune teller/palm reader. I should have stopped by there first to learn how lacking this food was going to be, and then not go.    :)

Lots of great beers on the menu,and a huge place to eat and drink! I had the Idle Hands, and then the Sunbru. Both very crispy, cold, and full flavoured. I guess they were about $8.00 beers.  Didn't really get a look at the menu here, but they have tons of stuff. Stop in for a beer, why don't ya?

The taste of the 8 oz sirloin I got here earned the 5. I got a side of their spicy bbq sauce (which it wasn't) to go along with it.   Started the meal with the Cajun shrimp which was grilled jumbo shrimp in a beer sauce...delicious.   Back to the steak. I got it with grilled veggies. The steak was probably the most delicious flavor I've ever had. Their grill has some amazing flavor on it. This piece of meat was cooked to perfection, and didn't need a thing.   I had 2 glasses of Mondavi Cabernet, and with everything it was under $50.   They ask you if you want dessert, and if you say no they give you a little bag of little sugary doughnuts.

I'd give this a 10 if there was one. The taste of this food, and the English Pub feel of the place captured my heart! :) It's dark inside, and they were playing punk rock, and other rock in that same sort of vein.  I ate at the bar. The bar tender is happy to make recommendations. For beer I had a 14 oz Bitburger, and then a 14 oz Kronenburg 1664. Both were cold and refreshing.   My appetizer was the crispy and flavorful scotch egg. It's a hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage with a fried outer crust.   My meal was the bangers & mash pasty. This must be what they serve up in heaven. It's a golden pastry filled with pork, sage sausage, grilled onions, and mashed potatoes. It comes with a side of red wine gravy. Un effing believable!  Finished my meal with a nice neat 12 year scotch. And I'm in love.

I criticize chain restaurants like this all the time, but maybe I shouldn't. When you aren't in the mood to trek around and find something super unique,  sometimes places like the Olive Garden can really hit the spot. Let's admit it, the food is consistent and delicious, and the they're always piping in good, jazzy, classic music like Sinatra or Bennett or whatever.  The Zuppa Toscana is a creamy soup with potatoes, sausage, onion, kale, and other stuff. This is a perfect soup! For the entree I had the Stuffed Chicken Marsala, which is stuffed with cheese and mushrooms, served with garlic mashed potatoes...delicious.   With dinner I enjoyed a 9 oz mini carafe of the Francis Coppola Diamond Cabernet, which was just so-so.   Service was friendly, food was pleasing, price was easy. What more do you want heh? About $30 for myself.

Long line, delicious BBQ! My associate said "wanna go about 9:45 tomorrow for lunch?" For lunch, I asked?? He knew what he was talking about. I agreed to meet him at 10:30 instead, and we were in line until noon.   To pass the time, I went to a nearby mini market, and got us 2 beers in brown bags. Parked a block or 2 down, right by a cannibus dispensary, and walked up to the spot. The long line in the sun was helped to be less toasty by the misting system they had spraying around the perimeter. Outside there are picnic tables, and you see all of their wood for smoking, and gigantic BBQ grills, super professional.   Every once in a while a guy come out to give a meat update to let everyone know what meat had run out. People really wanted the fatty brisket. By the time we got into the builfing to order, that fatty brisket was all gone. The guy in front of us ordered the last of it, which was 3 pounds worth to go.   Oh well, I had a qtr lb of each thing including: lean brisket, ribs, chop, and hot links. It came with jalapeno grits (a little bland) and some beans. I took one of their tiny pecan pies to go.   Got to meet the owners and their cute baby. They get to cooking at like 4:30 am everyday, and this young husband and wife team seem to have a good thing going!  They also take huge orders for you nexty big event, but you have to find out how to order in advance. From what I understood, there is a waiting list for those big orders, so you'd better call to find out about that.

I ordered a platter of sliders, southwest eggrolls and wings. Everything was pretty acidic. The service was fast, the beer was cold, and it was your Basic Chili's food, so not that great.   One thing I didn't like was how they had just one girl busting her but on seemingly everything, while others were apparently busy with something else. Looked like she needed more help. No one was happy to be working there at all.

Sometimes a place earns a 5 just because of the food, or even just the food you ordered that time. This was that. I stopped into this sheik, modern, diner style restaurant and bar, and was pleasantly amazed by what I ate.   I had the FEZ lettuce wraps appetizer which were chicken with dried pears, dates, dried cherries & almonds with romaine lettuce shells. So good!  Then for the meal I had the FEZ Lemon & Pomegranate grilled plate with blackened salmon...wow! It had grilled veggies and pistachio rice.  Every bite of this meal was heaven.   (And it's a great song by Steely Dan)
