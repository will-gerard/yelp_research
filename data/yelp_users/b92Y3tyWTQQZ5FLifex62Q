Yes I do rock the hipster joints.  I dig this place.  A little bit of a scene, but the food is solid and the service is great. Hard not like it.  All in all a great spot.  I tend to switch up my favorites but I typically hit this up for breakfast when in the 602.

THEY HAVE LOST MY CAR ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASION.  I normally don't like to write negative reviews but come on folks!!  I have had to go down there two different times and find my own car after I dropped it off.  I can see loosing a child in the mall or a pet in the desert.  But a near new Genesis luxury sedan now that is just plain criminal.  I am not sure about there sales but this doesn't bode well for management.  You have a lot of choices in the valley for Hyundai I wouldn't choose these guys for services.  Also it took them a full week to do a recall on my sedan.  It seems like this is a trend with these guys.  Stop loosing cars!! It is bad!!

I really dig this place.  I would give it five stars but the food is very good but never hits excellent.  Also my last trip there which was a few days ago, I had the pleasure of starring at some dudes ass crack who was sitting in front of me at the bar.  Not Oregano's fault.  But still there was some middle aged wanna be hipster with 1980's grunge greasy long hair. Anyway on to the food.  Lately I have been ordering the Pablo Picasso Hispanic Orientated salad.  I have been dieting, a little on the "fat" side lately. Sometimes I get two bear claws wedged right in this spot.  After some research I found without the dressing and corn chips it is not to bad on the calorie intake.  Also the flavor really is excellent, the chicken is super well done.  It is fajita style but maybe better.  Also note to one bartender stop charging me for soda water with a small amount of lemonade and I will tip much better.   Oregano's I will see you soon.

Yeah i am a globe trotter.  Yeah I am a world traveler I do the Tucson to Phoenix thing all the time.  That being said I really dig this place.  The food is solid.  It is super fresh. It has a ton of flavor.  The eggplant will rock your world.  Definitely worth a try.  The service is usually friendly and passable. But I will come back often.
