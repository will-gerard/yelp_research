After three trips to Vegas, I finally had my first Fat Tuesday, and it was the stupidest thing I've done in years.  I got what was called a 44 Magnum -- which is a blend of the 190 Octane (their most popular flavor... a sick blend of grain alcohol with their famous orange punch) and the Hurricane (which has 151 and other random punches).  I asked for a monster yard (pretty much what all the guys in my group had... I don't know how many ounces but they said they were gone after finishing them), and instead the cashier gave me a size that was like two thirds of my height (I stand at 5'4").   I didn't stop him because I don't usually do that.  And hell, it's Vegas.  And then my friends bought five extra shots ($1 each) of Everclear Vodka and dropped it in there.  It's funny because they pour the shots in vials and just drop them into the container, so it sinks to the bottom... causing the top and bottom to be especially strong of alcohol.  Bill rung up $45.  We walked from Caesars Palace to the MGM Grand, and I was already dragging the container a little less than half of the way there.  To put it plainly, "I was fucked up."  A lot of feelings and emotions were happening.  I was happy and energetic, and then I started hating life.  But not only did I not yack, I still made it to the club later that night.  Fuck the haters.  Minus one star because the server gave me the wrong size.

Probably the most overrated club in the history of Las Vegas nightlife. (Although let's keep in mind that I'm not reviewing their daytime activities.  I hear that's a lot better than their nightlife, so this review in no way analyzes that experience.)  For one, it's a nice club.  For some reason I felt like I was in one of those clubs where the bad guys from Rush Hour 2 chill after a long day of murder.  They also got girls in what looks like fish tanks (not cages) dancing.  I found it more funny rather than enticing.  There are two main dance floors, a big one for house, and a more intimate setting for hip hop.  And for the first few hours, they sucked.  However the hell their DJs are need to no longer be hired.  The hip hop room plays bottom 40 non-hits from decades ago... in other words, undanceable... and the house room was inconsistent with "drops."  Luckily, with some patience, things got better.  Both rooms started to get hella crackin, and I guess it gave the DJs hard-ons or something because they suddenly clicked.  Why 2 stars?  It was almost too crackin.  So crackin that you'd see trains of guys headed to the dance floor followed by one girl... an old girl at that.  Since Tao is popular to EVERYBODY, it means old people are there too.  And guys.  Lots of guys who think they got game.  *shakes head*  To make matters worse, WELL cocktails are $15-25 each.  Horrible.  I'm just not going to make a big deal about that because their bartenders are hella chill people.  I actually bought the blonde chick at the hip hop room a drink for being somebody cool to talk to.  (But yeah, if you're striking a conversation you can actually hear in a HIP HOP room... that means it wasn't crackin in there.)  Again.  Probably the most overrated club in the history of Las Vegas nightlife.  Oh yeah, there's hella stairs.  So ladies, if you're wasted (and guys won't be wasted here because drinks are too expensive and most of yall get it free), take off your heels when you leave the club.  The stairs are carpeted so you don't have to worry about catching chlamydia.

When you're highly intoxicated, or at least trying to recover from extreme intoxication, everything tastes good.  That wasn't the case with this place.  I ordered a steak with some of their popular corned beef on the side, and I just didn't like what I was eating.  A friend of mine said I ordered "the wrong thing" and should've stuck with a sandwich.  But what the heck, steak and corned beef?  Isn't that supposed to automatically be good?  Took a to-go box home, and I didn't even pick at it. I left it at the hotel.  That's $20 I could've easily used on 100 McNuggets.  Or a cheap escort.

Words can't express how awesome The Signature is.  As with all Vegas luxury, it's something you have to pay for.  But if you have Mlife card, it becomes a whole lot more affordable.  A fellow Yelper friend of mine had comps for a 2-bedroom suite, and it was amazing.  We had a nice view of Wet Republic and there were 3 bathrooms.  One in every bedroom, and one in the living room.  Also, the living room featured a convertible couch so it was technically like having 3 bedrooms.  We were 3 dudes, and it was awesome knowing that we didn't have to share anything.  While the MGM Signature is literally at the end of the strip, there really isn't much of a point to even hit the strip.  EVERYTHING is here.  There's a Fat Tuesday downstairs, their craps tables have awesome bonus bets, and the service is simply top notch.  And if you're trying to go to the club, Hakkasan is downstairs.  This is where you wanna be if you play Mlife.

When I toured Las Vegas, all the places I've eaten that had me begging to go home.  The Circus Circus Buffett is by far the worst I've ever been to.  I get that every buffett restaurant won't have high quality food, but you'd expect things to at least be edible.  At any buffett place, the first thing you'd try is fried chicken, because it's probably the safest thing to eat, right?  Wrong.  Circus Circus fried chicken is as dry as my grandpa's elbow, and it's as tough as biting a crocodile--not that I've done that before.  I don't even need to talk about how bland it was.  I've said it in other reviews, but I spent more time filling myself with fluids than eating actual food.  The best food this place served was waffles, and come on--that's a breakfast item.  Of course, it's Circus Circus.  I'm just surprised this place hasn't closed down yet.  This was the spot in the 80's, but that was like 20 years ago.

Other than the airport and the hotel, my first stop during my last trip to Vegas just happened to be my first dayclub experience... and boy, will this get me spoiled!  Wet Republic is awesome.  The mist-machined roofs make the place more bearable, and everybody here is pretty cool and chill to talk to.  My friends and I decided to go VIP and order a deluxe cabana, and there was more than enough room for us to chill.  A long couch, three pool beds, a flatscreen TV to watch the game on, and a super hot hostess.  And when I say super hot... I'm saying 10.  Like she was so damn attractive that the single guys in our party had to pretend to look at their phones while wearing sunglasses to catch a glimpse at our server.  Aside from the attractive people (I mean most of the girls I saw at Wet Republic were at least 7s), there's also some good sustenance served here.  We ordered a bucket of fries and chicken tenders as well as tacos.  They were all terrific.  I also ordered a shrimp cocktail which was exquisite... except the only had five in there.  Well, at least they were huge.  And to wash that all down, aside from the complimentary Fiji water and some Coronas, we had their signature Dragonberry Mojitos, which were EXCELLENT.  The dragonberry mojito is probably now my most favorite alcoholic beverage.  As for the people, I was a little scared of that because I don't know how to swim, but the good thing is if you're swimming here, you'll look like an idiot.  The smell of chlorine is strong, but the ultra pool is normally so crackin that once you get out, you'll taste salt.  In other words, it's probably the dirtiest pool in the world.  I mean think about it... all the hot bodies, sweat... spilled alcohol.  Oh yeah, you the servers will actually go out to the pool and serve you your drinks if you're not in your cabana or bungalow.  The only thing I'd do differently is I'd probably try to get a bungalow next time (though the deluxe cabana is awesome) and I'd pack flipflops.  At 100+ degree heat, the ground gets pretty hot.  My feet were extremely tender lately that evening because I might've suffered minor burns.  All in all it was a great time, and I definitely would come back.  Man, those were some good mojitos and man was that server a fine, fine woman.

As a club, I like it.  A lot.  Yeah, it's small.  There's no floors upon floors of dance floors, but it does enough to give everybody a good time.  Not only is the bottle service affordable, if you don't finish what you have -- you can take it back to your room.  As for the music?  Awesome.  We were fortunate enough to see Lupe Fiasco doing his own set... and I was like whattt?  Lupe Fiasco?!  He DJs?!  He does, and he's not bad at all.  Good crowds of people too.  As soon as I sat down, folks at the other table were talking to me.  But once the music started playing I got crazy.  I even got up on the table wall thingies and literally freaked every girl on them.  I quickly went down after first glimpse of seeing a bouncer tell someone to get off... but as soon as he was gone, it was back to the top!   I literally did that all night.  Yes, I was still recovering from my 4-foot Fat Tuesday, but Lavo was just a smackin good time.  Drinks are the $15 you'd expect in Vegas, but screw it I had bottle service.  I even danced with our bottle service host.  She was a looker too.

I came here with virtually no expectations and came out extremely amazed.  Maybe I should've came in with expectations... after all, it's a location in The Cosmopolitan, what's probably the best hotel in the Las Vegas strip.  While the place is indeed a buffet, there is sort of a cool portion control trick they do here.  A lot of their menu items are served on smaller platters or containers.  For example, edamame was put in their own Chinese to-go boxes, and the mac and cheese came in their own little saucers.  It's a good strategy because people waste all sorts of food at buffets, and it allows people to rethink what actually goes on their buffet plate.  My group arrived for brunch and it was right before 2PM, so we were greeted with complimentary mimosas. On that note, they're bottomless for an extra $8.  While it's a tempting option, I didn't do it because I knew I'd be having a rather large Fat Tuesday a little later.  Wicked Spoon's international buffet options are simply amazing.  From well-marinated Korean BBQ beef strips to their fried rice, the food was amazing.  Mind you, the sushi isn't anything to write home about.  The coolest fusion at the buffet was probably the pork inside the falafel.  The plum sauce really added quite a zest to it.  Another buffet item worth a mention is their eggs benedict.  Call me a noob, but I've never seen eggs benedict served at a buffet, and Wicked Spoon had a lot of things you wouldn't normally see served including bone marrow... which I didn't get to try, but I will next time!  The dessert options aren't as great as what you'd find at The Wynn's buffet, but there are some head-turners.  I got this huge cake pop that I thought looked delicious...until I bit into it to find out it was a huge truffle.  Scrumptious!  The gelato here is also good, though I only tried the mango, biscotti, mint, and almond joy.  And for the record, the almond joy gelato is a silent killer of great flavor.  Wicked Spoon is simply great.  I might even call it the best buffet in Vegas.  Might.  Also, if you gamble a lot, sign up for the Cosmo's Identity Card.  For every 25 points you accumulate, you get a free spin on the wheel, and one of those prizes is a free meal at the buffet.  Definitely worth it.

A friend and I were looking around The Cosmo for a food court, and we thought we walked into one when entering China Poblano.  Boy, were we wrong.  We were immediately greeted by a very enthusiastic host who was knowledgeable of pretty much the whole menu.  He recommended things like ceviche, the house fried rice (which apparently is internationally recognized) and some various kinds of dim sum.  To put it very plainly, China Poblano is a tapas bar and restaurant that specializes in both Chinese and Mexican finger food.  The thing is everything here is a bit pricey.  That being said, I elected to just get some chips, guac, and salsa.  I'm normally pretty picky with my guacamole, but I must say that it was probably the best green stuff I've ever had that I didn't make myself.  That says a lot.  The chips were fresh and the salsa added a nice spicy kick.  My friend ordered a dim sum sampler that included two pieces each of whatever dumplings they had, which was also pretty good.  Overall, while we were disappointed that we'd be spending a whole lot more than we would at the food court, we walked out of the eatery pleasantly surprised.  I'll definitely be back to try that fried rice the host was talking about.

If you want a taste of the greatest place to drop the bass, it's definitely Marquee.  Marquee is the best club in Vegas.  Hands down.  Without a hook it'll cost an arm and a leg to get in, and it's crackin every night... ESPECIALLY Saturday.  The main floor is house and transe, and the DJs they have are crackin.  Outside the double open doors is a patio overlooking the Las Vegas strip from the glamourous Cosmopolitan Resort.  On top of that there's usually a DJ spinning there too, chicks taking advantage of photo opportunities near hot tubs and pools, and a bar.  Drinks go for about the regular $14 Vegas fare, and that's surprising because at XS they can go from $40-60.  The top floor is normally surrounded by VIP folks because premium service tables are up there, and there really isn't a whole lot of room to dance.  The "library" as they like to call it also has its own bar, and in all three of my visits to Marquee, the bartender there is usually the most sociable.  The middle floor, if you can find it with all the stairs features the mainstream hip hop most party people like, and through all my experiences it's always been the most packed.  When I'm feelin' it I normally head straight to the middle, and I swear it took me almost 7 minutes to do that with like no drink in hand.  If there's any problem with Marquee, it's with their bouncers.  They're super strict, and sometimes they're just full of crap.  On my latest foray into the club we tried to get a bottle because there was no way we were going to get in even with the guestlist (the line was intensely long... plus it was Saturday), and they upped the costs to $1500.  I'm down to live like a baller, but with 3 people in my party we weren't about to shell out $500 each to get in.  Luckily we found girls we met at Tao who were able to make it a 4-3 guy-girl ratio.  My other problem with the security involves the main dance floor itself.  I was just following some girls in, and all of a sudden he doesn't let me in through that side of the dance floor... forcing me to walk around the circumference of the floor to find another way through.  I really don't understand how or why that happened.  I get that they're doing their jobs, but that was ridiculous.  But with four different places to dance, the cocktails at the bar being excellent at a normal price, and probably the most attractive party people in the city... Marquee is Vegas' marquee hot spot.

Caesars. Free shows.  A bigass aquarium. Fat Tuesdays.  Vuitton.  Versace.  A two-story Nike.  A three-story H&M.  And it's not that crowded.  This is the epicenter of shopping at Las Vegas.

Sorry, Wicked Spoon.  Bacchanal is the buffet to be at in Vegas.  Aside from The Forum Shops, the arena, and the casino itself, the place to be at in the palace is Bacchanal Buffet.  A friend of mine, and fellow Yelp Elite Ferdinand L., got me and another buddy in here, and it was awesome... Especially after what was the second night in a row of disappointment and terrible decisions in the desert.  The place is pretty damn pricey, but it's worth it.  The choices are plentiful, and the place is huge.  Each corner of the buffet features cuisine from different parts of the globe, and like Wicked Spoon, the majority of them are already separated by serving size.  Some of the choices even include contemporary takes on everyday foods.  One of the more interesting menu items was a Mac and Cheese pizza--talk about packing on the carbs.  The highlight here in my opinion is their Asian food selection and individually bottled juices.  It's not just juice either--there's horchata too.  How was the horchata?  Best I've ever had.  It was like having CT Crunch milk.  I literally wanted to pocket like 6 of those Starbucks Frapp-shaped bottles.  Another tidbit for everybody, get a TRC.

Definitely not worth your time or money despite being a "cheaper" option. It's my fault for craving Asian food at an old resort, but this isn't even up to Panda Express' standard.   I ordered a 3-item combo so I could use one of my rewards coupons for a free drink, and it was a pitiful waste of $10.  I was better off getting $10 spicy McChickens.   Vegetable fried rice was poorly cooked. Kind of soggy and grainy.   The Kung Pow chicken was mostly water chestnuts and cardboard carrots.   The "premium" extra dollar Thai shrimp was okay at best with plenty of onions.   The beef broccoli was the best thing I had. The broccoli was cooked well but I don't even remember having much beef.   So upsetting. Luckily I can use this as a business write off.   Excuse me as I use the restroom to get rid of what I just ate.

I've only been here once, and it was a rather awkward experience.  Whenever I go to Vegas, the friends that I prefer to hang out with will live and die by MGM.  We went here looking for an okay spot for dinner, and it was a really disappointing experience.  At first, the service seemed good.  Our hostess was very welcoming as she led us to our booth, and I'll tell you -- in public, me and the guys are quite cool to be around.  But we never saw our server again.  I ordered a "Homemade Fireball" because it's a favorite of us back home, but it was horrible.  We had no chase either.  Disgusting.  I ordered a rack of ribs, which is usually conservative choice because you can't really grill those wrong, so it was good.  My friend had some nachos to start and those were great, but he didn't enjoy his entree--I think it was tuna.  My other friend didn't enjoy his prime rib either.  We don't usually box stuff, but that's what we ended up doing.  I see myself coming back for beer... but it's Vegas, I'm rarely ever here to have a beer.  But since I'm getting older, I'll probably hit this spot up on a casual Vegas night.

I was in Scottsdale for business, and when I had a free minute to myself, I hit up one of my friends who happened to be stationed in Arizona for his military duties. After telling him about my lenten diet that requires me to abstain from meat and rice, we settled on Sushi J.  It was nothing short of fantastic.  Parking is easy because it's located in a plaza that wasn't even close to busy, and we were seated at the bar.  I was telling the chefs about the situation with my diet, and one had the audacity of saying, "Don't worry.  I got you."  He asked what kind of fish I liked, and then proceeded to make two customized rolls for me--each of which were fantastic.  One used both hamachi and spicy tuna, with rice paper wrapping it together with some lettuce, green onion and cucumber.  The other roll was also wrapped in rice paper, and it included unagi, avocado, topped with a drop of Sriracha with something else crunchy.  They were awesome.  I haven't seen this friend in a while so we also ordered some sake bombs as well as the calamari, which was also quite tasty.  The green tea mochi ice cream was also good.  After dinner I found out that the person who made me those customized rolls was the head chef.  How crazy is that?  I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the area.
