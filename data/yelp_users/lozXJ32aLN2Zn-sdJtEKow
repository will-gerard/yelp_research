We came here for my wife's Birthday.  It was my first experience at The Melting Pot and it was a great one.  We were greeted upon walking in and seated right away.  They seated us in a small private booth for two which was very nice.  Each of the booths has a curtain that they pull shut so you feel like you are all alone.  There was only a "dull roar" from the other guests in the restaurant, so it was very nice.    Our server was excellent.  She was outgoing and very helpful in explaining the menu.  We got the cheese and chocolate fondue with a salad.  All three courses were great.  We had the cheddar fondue which you can't go wrong with.  The different varieties of bread that we dipped in the fondue with delicious. My wife and I both got the house salad, hers with ranch and I got mine with the house dressing.  My dressing was sweet and the salad was very good. I would probably try it with ranch next time as ranch is my go-to dressing.  We finished off with the chocolate fondue which was amazing.  It had strawberries, rice-crispy treats, marshmallows, etc.  Dessert was the best course of the meal.    It was a little on the pricey side for us, but a great choice for special occasions and well worth it!  It may be my choice for my Birthday dinner later this year :)

Great family-owned company.  Had them out today to tune up my system and the technician was very professional, did a good job.  Will definitely call them out if I have trouble in the future or need a tuneup next season.

Great food, good service and a very affordable lunch. I would recommend the lunch special calzone.

The guys from work and I used to come here quite often.  They used to be super busy and the past couple times they haven't been as busy.  They also changed something up in their recipe (different cheese I think) and it wasn't for the better.  To be honest,  it's not a place I will frequent too often based on their recipe change.  They still have great service and great prices though. Hope they revert to the old recipe whatever it was. It used to be a winner.

I've been back a couple of times recently since my last review.  They've raised their price slightly on the lunch special, but the calzones have been much better.  Whatever they changed originally, must have been corrected.  Still a great dine-in lunch for the price and the service is still very good.

Very good food, nice atmosphere, AMAZING hummus.  Very nice lake-side dining.  The one time I did sit outside,the service could have been better.  They were kind of busy that evening though.  Would recommend and will go back in the future.

I have been with Progressive for almost 5 years.  I recently canceled a policy due to the selling of a vehicle, and they sent me a bill for $31 for canceling the policy.  They told me that it was a law by Arizona.  I also see several people complaining about them in regards to them not being responsive to claims that are filled.  Fortunately I haven't had to file a claim with them yet, but I may think about switching.  Although, I would get charged $60 to cancel my other two policies.  I asked the lady if that was their way of kicking a customer in the butt on the way out and she said "well, no".  What a joke!

Good food, good service and I really like the "back east" feel to the restaurant.

I've been here many times, but my last experience kind of turned me off to this location.  I will go to the DQ at Gilbert and Juniper.    On my last visit here, I ordered a chocolate dipped waffle cone.  He tried to charge me for a regular cone and I knew because they price was off.  I tried to clarify in person that I didn't want a regular cone.  He charged me for the chocolate dipped cone and gave me a regular waffle cone.  I figured it wasn't worth arguing with him over it so I took the cone and left.

It's been a while since I have been there but when I first started riding I was told to go check this place out.  By the look of their website, one would would think the store would be much bigger and maybe a large chain of stores.  Nope, they have a small suite that is hard to find unless you are looking for it, but it is worth the find.  These people were very friendly and very helpful.  I was able to try different riding gear on before purchasing and if it wasn't in stock or have my size or they didn't normally carry it, they were more than happy to order anything in their catalog for me and call me when it was in.  I have been very pleased with the products I purchased there and when I need riding gear in the future, I will definitely return!

A friend of mine recommended that I check out Forever Diamonds when I was shopping for an engagement ring.  I have been in there a handful of times, a few for engagement rings and again looking for wedding bands.  Each time, the staff has been very friendly, helpful and patient.  My wedding band came in with some imperfections that couldn't be fixed.  A new band had to be ordered and they took the old one and ordered a new one, no questions asked.  Second one was perfect.  I will definitely be back for future jewelry needs.  A+ customer service!

I heard about this office through a co-worker and decided to check them out.  I was surprised to be able to establish care and get a cleaning on the same visit.  I have been to dental offices before that tell you that you have to establish care first.  They they find "cavities" and want to take care of all your dental work before they will even do a cleaning.  I hope that I have the same dental insurance plan for a while, cause I will continue to go here in the future.

I've had Checklist out to inspect both of my home purchases.  John is very informative and helpful in explaining any potential issues with the home no matter how big or small.  In my last inspection, there were some very minor issues in the home that he said were easier for him just to fix them rather than write up in his report.  He's happy to answer any additional questions that come up even after the inspection is over.  Just like with the first reviewer, he checked my irrigation system which isn't required for the home inspection when closing on a house.  If you are purchasing a home, I would highly recommend Checklist!  They are very professional, informative and helpful.  I give them an A+ for customer service.

I went here with a large group of friends from church.  They served us all the same meal and told us a little bit about the food that we had eaten.   They served us a salad and pita bread with humus.  Both very tasty.  I love some good humus and good, this was.  For the main course, they served us rice with raisins, chicken kabob, and meat which was lamb and beef together.  They only had a couple of servers that evening, but I felt that they did a very good job of handling our large group.  It was very good, and I would definitely go back and try them again.

Went here for Mothers Day with the family.  Up-scale italian food.  Service and food were good.  I would go back there again.  Check it out some time.

Couple of my co-workers and I came here the other day.  It's a very small restaurant nested between a couple other shops.  They have some great lunch specials and it was very good and very filling.  I would definately consider stopping by again.

Called my warranty company cause my toilet was leaking out the bottom.  They sent this company out and I have to say, the guy did a very good job.  He fixed more than I thought he would and did the job right, and because it was through my warranty company I didn't have to pay any extra.  Would consider calling this company in the future (warranty or not).

This is another company that if I could give them 0 stars, I would.  Their accounting is so messed up.  Every time I call them for support, they tell us that we have different services than the last time I called.  They also tell me that we canceled our PRI with them.  Well, then how am I calling you if we don't have phone service?  They are also trying to offer us 4.5Mb from our 3Mb, when we have been quoted for two 25Mb lines for the same price elsewhere.  What a joke!  Do not to business with this company unless you absolutely have to.

Been purchasing tires from discount for many years (6 sets so far).  I have been to several different locations around the east valley and have been pleased with the service and the quality of the tires I get there.  They came out with this policy a few years ago that if the tires you had weren't from them, they charged you $15 for a flat repair, but if you replaced your tires, you would get that money back.  They only did that once for me.  The last couple of vehicles I have had, they fix the flat at no charge, no matter where my tires were from.  They know I have bought enough tires that I will be back in the future.  Over-all very pleased with all of the discount locations I have been at and the service level.  Will be back again for new tires when the time comes.

If I could give 0 stars, I would.  Terrible salesmen.  They are the type that hold your keys until you buy a car from them.  Ended up buying the car, but will not do business with them or any other car dealer again.

Not only did I receive poor service when I bought my car about two years ago, but they still call me and send me stuff in the mail.  I had a salesman call me a few months ago and leave me a message so I called back and left a message for him to call me back.  He called back and I politely asked him to take me off their calling list and told him about my buying experience.  He apologized and explained that they don't do those shady business practices anymore and asked me to come in for just 20 minutes (so that he could try to convince me to trade in my car).  I told him again I wasn't interested in buying ANY car from anyone right now as my current one meets my needs and told him again to take me off the calling list.  They sent me a birthday card and called me on my birthday and asked me to call back (again probably to try to get me to come in and buy another car).  I finally recorded a voice mail for them explaining my poor experience and saying that I would be calling a lawyer if they called again.  They didn't leave a message that time and I haven't heard from them yet.  These people are seriously desperate to take advantage of anyone and must think the previous buyers are dumb enough to buy from them again.    I hope they go out of business soon.

Yep, they are still calling. I called back and talked to someone who claimed to be the general manager.  Told him I would be calling a lawyer if they called again and also filled a complaint with the BBB asking them not to call and for an official apology for their harassment.  Got a note back saying that they wouldn't contact me again. No apology. Guess that will have to do.
