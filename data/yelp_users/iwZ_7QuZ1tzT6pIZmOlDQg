Gonna have to give this one a "no thanks" I'm afraid.  Went today at lunch with a couple of co-workers, and the food was totally underwhelming.  Nothing "special" at all about any of the items.  The guacamole seemed to have some sour cream in it to stretch it - tasted very bland.  Red and green salsa served with run-of-the-mill chips did nothing for us.  Meat in all the dishes was tender but not very flavorful.  Shrimp Diabla sauce was neither hot nor very tasty.  All in all, a disappointing lunch.  Won't be back, and with all the good options in town for excellent Mexican food, I was sad that we did not find a good new place to frequent.

I'm gonna have to join all the 5-star reviewers.  This place is TOTALLY AWESOME !!  (forgive my usage of the cliched 80s standby, but this applies here !!)   Everything was just about right.  The service was prompt and helpful. The salad was fresh and crispy. The rice was filled with little chunks of green beans and carrots and I think corn too. The refried beans were not overly fatty nor were they overly salty. The guacamole was chunky and tasty, with BIG chunks of avocado. The corn tortillas were light, soft, and fresh. The Shrimp culichi sauce was so good that I was eating it with a spoon. The Negra Modelo on tap in a 28-oz glass for $3 was a super-bargain and Oh So Cold and Yummy. The chips were hot and fairly thick and a little oily - top notch. The red salsa was smokey and had a bit of kick. The green tomatillo/avocado salsa was about the best I've had in town. OH YES I ALMOST FORGOT:  They gave me an "on the house" Ceviche tostada, and it was the BEST Ceviche I have EVER tasted.  I don't normally like it, but this was SCRUMPTIOUS.  Can't wait for tomorrow to munch on the leftovers.  This place is not only a great Mexican SEAFOOD restaurant - it's about as good as any REGULAR Mexican restaurant in town.  Miss out on trying this place? That would be a bad move.

I'm going solid 4 stars, but with a caveat....:)  The chips were hot and crispy - 4.5 stars. The "hot"salsa was nicely done - 4.5 stars. The "green" salsa was one of the best I've had - 5 stars.  The show-buster which gets 6 stars is the "Spicy Chicken Soup."  I read the review of this soup in the New Times 2007 "Best Of..." and have to agree that it's one of the better chicken soups around .  Perfectly salted (meaning not overly salty) and with the right amount of pepper.  Nice big chunks of obviously 100% "REAL" chicken breast (no fillers, nothing fake about it ) and zucchini and whole baby carrots.  Sprinkled with a touch of corn and rice and small slivers of onion.  Very tasty combo of flavors. Hits the spot on a cold 50 degree day.  The caveat?  My other friend had the lunch combo with a taco and a cheese enchilada, refried beans and rice.  Absolutely nothing special or very tasty about any of the stuff on his plate.  Bland.  Boring.  Cheap-looking and cheap-tasting.  So if you are in the mood for some good, decently flavored chicken soup, and some above-average chips and salsa, give it a try.  If you're gonna order a combo meal, I'd say take your business elsewhere.

Wanna know how to tell when your lunch salad is REALLY good?  When you "drool a little bit" in between bites, like I did today with my Chopped Turkey Salad from La Grande Orange.  I went there on Sunday 10-24, and to be honest, the setup is a little confusing for newcomers.  Order on THIS side, pickup food on THAT side, come back to THIS side to get dessert.  It's enough to make you want to just get in the car and drive home.  But DON'T !!!  If it weren't for the "Drool Event" which occurred today, I probably would not have posted this review at all.  I shared the Green Chile Burger with my daughter, and we were both underwhelmed, really.  Nothing awesome about the burger.  Oh, it's FAR better than fast food burgers, but it's not comparable to Lobby's or Chuckbox (my two top burgers in town, probably.)  The french fries were a little thin and not too memorable really.  My son had the wings and loved them  But a hitch - I SPECIFICALLY requested RANCH for the wings, and they came out with Blue Cheese, which I then had to take back and get exchanged for Ranch.  Not a huge problem, but just a little annoying.  The Ranch was very good however.  The "Olive Oil Cake" that everyone RAVES about?  Meh.  It's just an extra-moist version of your average pound cake.  Tastes just like the pound cake I grew up eating in Texas, but it was a little "oilier" than your usual pound cake fare.  It was good, but not "Oh My God!" good.  Now for the best item I had from there:  The Drool Creator.  It was mostly an afterthought, really.  While standing in line to get the Olive Oil cake to go, I saw the little section where they keep their "to go" salads.  I looked around at the varieties, and thought the Chopped Turkey Salad looked promising - bacon, boiled egg, turkey slices, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and two different dressings - Blue Cheese and some sort of yellowish vinaigrette.   I decided to take one home and eat it for lunch at work on Monday and Tuesday.  Great.  Decision.  I don't really know what the magic was.  Maybe it was just a good combination of flavors.  Maybe it was just all fresh.  Maybe they use some sort of Magical Salad Crack.  I don't know.  But it was a DANG good salad.  Even on the third day, when I ate the last of it.  I just combined both dressings ( about half of each little container each day ) and it was marvelous.  Not too many meals cause me to drool in between bites.  This salad had some serious Mojo.  I WILL be back for another one, hoping to recapture the Magic.

Excellent Burritos and tortillas.  I had a Chorizo/Egg/Potato/Bean and a Green Chile and they were both super-tasty.  $7.98 total.  The chorizo is different in a GOOD way than what I have had elsewhere in town.  The spices they use give it almost a "signature" taste.  A lot different than most I have had, possibly the tastiest.   It's easy to see why they sell the chorizo uncooked for people to take home - they know they have a winner on their hands.  The green chile is very good too, and very close to Rito's flavor, which I have always considered the best green chile burro in town.  Rito's burros are a little bigger than these though.  I'm going with a big-time thumbs up on Carolina's, a solid 4.5 stars.  Can't wait to go back.....:)  P.S.  UPDATE !!! After going for breakfast here about 10 out of the last 11 weekends, I still LOVE this place.  I normally now eat the Chorizo Tostada for breakfast, and get one of the burritos to take home - any flavor is good.  HOWEVER, I tried one item today that was sub-par and I'd like to warn people about.  The Hard Taco was not good AT ALL.  First, it was one of those taco shells which is not crunchy, and not soft, but kinda.....stretchy?  The meat was shredded beef, and it was greasy with no apparent seasonings.  Quite unexpected from a place where SO many things are GREAT.  Anyway, stay away from THAT one item, but everything else I have tried is great.  P.S. UPDATE NUMBER 2:   The best time to eat at Carolina's is on Saturday.  They have the "Menudo Fixins" put out for you to use:  Chopped cilantro, chopped green and white onions, oregano, and red pepper flakes, and lemon wedges.  You don't have to eat menudo to use these fixins, and I like to put them on my tostadas or burros and it really takes the flavors to another plateau.  A must-do.

Although I rounded up to 4 stars, I'd really rate it about a 3.8 if we could do decimals here on Yelp.  Short and to the point:  Service  - fairly quick, even for a Friday lunch.  Prices - very reasonable - $10 for a 2-piece entree and two sides  Fried Okra - excellent - about an 8 on a scale of 10. (  And I'm from TX, so I know me some good fried Okry.  )  Catfish - oddly shaped/sized - about 10 inches long and about an inch wide, with a slight twist.  Never had catfish shaped like this.  They were almost "over-sized catfish tenders" in a way.  Breading was basic cornmeal - did not notice any other spice.  They did however seem to be cooked for the PERFECT length of time - perfect crust, fish inside perfectly cooked and not dry at all, and no greasiness in sight.  I'd give this a higher score if the crust had a little more seasoning, but I give it about a 7 on a 10 scale.  French Fries - tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Potato salad - again, tasty but nothing to set it apart.  The bad:  My lunchmate had the fried Cod, and if they DO offer a second type of breading other than cornmeal, it was not offered or clearly marked on the menu, as far as we could see.  SO, because of that lack of info, his Cod came "cornmeal breaded" and he does not like that breading.  So he gives it 1 star for either not telling him or offering him the second crust option.  I'll be going back.  It's fairly close to both work and home, so that's a plus.

UPDATE:  If you like food that will burn your mouf a little bit and make your face sweat, go with the Bombero burrito.  I went back the day after my 3-star review (see below) and had a carne asada Bombero to go.  Not for the Wimpy Of Mouf.  VERY.  SPICY.  And I'm not a heat wimp.  I'm the person in my circles known as the "he likes it HOT" guy.  Living in AZ since 1995, I've only been to three places in AZ which have dishes hot enough to burn me and make my face sweat:  1.  Los Dos Molinos. 2.  Arriba (the side order of Hatch chiles - dare you to try the whole thing at once). 3.  Now, the Bombero from Los Taquitos.  I hereby improve the ranking from 3 to 4 stars based solely on the heat and tastiness of the Bombero, so take that for what it's worth.

Tried them again with the kids last night and have a few new things to say since my last visit.  I had Bombero sauce put onto a carne asada Chimi this time, and it was FABULOUS.  Works better on a chimi than a burrito, I think, because the sauce makes the burrito tortilla "wet" and does not have the same soggy effect on the fried shell of the chimi.  The carne asada last night was smokey and awesome.  It has not been this good on my prior visits.  It was pure, smokey goodness this trip.  The chicken hard-shell tacos held together better too....after falling apart last trip.  I wonder if they changed their shell a little?  Anyway, they were delicious.  A word about the "salad" too - it is that micro-shredded lettuce and a few tomatoes and a little white Mexican cheese sprinkled on top.  And it was all perfectly fresh and delicious.  The beans again were better than your average refried beans - something about them I can't place for sure, but they are delish.  The staff was great and friendly.  I'm gonna spend more time eating here.  It's pretty darn outstanding....

I ate at this place a few times a few years ago, and this dish was/is memorable:  Chuletas Con Chile Rojo ~ Just like Nana used to make...two pork chops grilled then simmered in a spicy red chile sauce. Served with rice, whole beans, warm flour tortillas, and green chile salsa on the side. $12.50  I had that every time, and it ROX.  Always enough to take home some after getting full.  Worth the trip.  Salsa and chips were good too.

Very nice little "market."  The son and I had breakfast there this morning.  He had the "American" breakfast with 3 scram eggs, "Liberty" potatoes, and the split meatball.  I had the biscuits and gravy, and we shared a side of bacon.  I had a Cortadito Cuban micro latte, although I'm not a coffee drinker - just wanted to see what the fuss was about.  It did not convert me, sadly.  Very decent breakfast and the price was in line with other places in town where the breakfast is above average (MBB, LGO, OE).  We liked the layout, and yes the unisex bathroom setup is totally hip (not in the modern interpretation of "hip" meaning douchey, but in the traditional definition of hip meaning pretty darn cool.)  Going back with both kids someday and see if we can try a few more things.  I wanted to try the Chorizo quesadilla and will do that next time.  On the list of "Top Notch Phoenix-Area Breakfast Joints" for sure.

This place has REALLY, REALLY tasty food.  The kids and I dropped in for an early dinner, and we liked everything we tried.  The Prickly Pear Chicken Sandwich is what I had.  Prickly pear marinated chicken breast with lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise & melted provolone, and I substituted for the green chile mayonnaise for 25 cents.  It was seasoned chicken on a freshly baked baguette and was VERY tasty.  The chicken was made super-tender by the marination and had a fabulous taste to it.  My daughter had the kid's menu cheeseburger and fries and she really liked it.  The boy had 6 medium buffalo wings and the chicken strip appetizer.  He compared the strips to the ones they serve at Rock-n-Roll Chicken Fingers, which is HIGH PRAISE indeed, because those are the best we have ever had.  For dessert we shared the "Fresh Half Baked Cookie with Ice Cream $5.00" and it reminded us of the cookie dessert at Oregano's which is basically the same thing.  We sere split on it - my daughter liked this one better, but the boy and I like Oregano's version a little better.  Either way, it was YUMMY !!  The waitress was efficient but a little "distant" like she was just going through the motions.  She seemed to be in a bad mood maybe - so I'm not going to ding the restaurant for that - but I hope I get someone in a better mood next time we eat there.  And there WILL be a next time.  Great little place to eat.

First of all, maybe some of the "steaks" might be delicious.  But the "sirloin" is definitely not.  I took my kids there last night for the first time ever, because the other place we wanted to eat was closed on Mondays (surprised) and OutBack was nearby.  /regret.  My daughter had the "kids meal sirloin" and it was not good at all.  Dry, with very little flavor.  She disliked it so much she asked for steak sauce, which she never generally asks for.  THEN, the waiter forgot she asked, and I had to ask a different server to get her some A1.  My daughter's words:  "I can't believe any kids like this steak."  My son had a garden salad with Ranch, and he liked that OK.  ( Hard to mess up a basic salad. )  He also liked his baked potato.  But he also had a sirloin, and did not like it much either.  Both kids had leftovers which I decided to take home, hoping maybe to add the steak to something else like a stew or soup.  I had the filet  ( which was kinda like a prime rib cut ) with mushroom sauce, a baked sweet tater, and the vegetable medley, which was snap peas, yellow squash, carrots, and broccoli I think. It was decent, but definitely not worth $14.95.  The potato was the best thing on the plate.  I had never really been impressed by OutBack the 2 or 3 times in my life I had eaten there, and this trip confirmed my suspicions.  Will not go back - ever.  Overpriced and just not tasty food.

This place's food is pretty dang awesome.  I ordered the "Rolled Taco Supreme" which is four (I think) rolled tacos piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and liberally topped with chopped, tasty carne asada chunks.  With a little pile of lettuce and a "superior grade" pico de gallo on the side.  The first time I had this, I literally INHALED IT.  It was that good.  My kids usually have the "rolled tacos with guacamole" plate and they dig on it.  Rivas' food is a step above the "'Ertos" places if you ask me.  And I've lived here 15 years and eaten at a lot of 'Ertos.  It's not fine dining by any stretch, but it's above average for the classification, and WAY good for a 24-hour joint.  Try it.  Go ahead.  Really.  :)

Salads are very iceberg-heavy.  Not bad, just old-fashioned.  Nothing remarkable.  My daughter commented that the lettuce tasted almost frozen.  Chicken Pot Pie ( "NEW" ) is not much more in quantity than the $3.50 frozen Swanson version you can cook at home.  Nothing remarkable here either.  French fries were hot and crunchy and good.  Best part of the meal.  Worst part:  The AWFUL chicken strips.  You know those mass-market wholesale version strips that are 90% thick, heavy breading and leave you about a 10% chicken portion?  Yep, they use those.  There is a layer of impossibly hard and tasteless breading on the outside, then a little thin moist layer of unfried breading under that, and then in the small remaining center a smidgen of real chicken.  NEGATIVE 500 STARS on the gross chicken strips.  I only went there because I had a BOGO entree' coupon.  Not worth it at all.  P.S.  I have eaten here several times (mostly because of coupons) and they all fell below 3 stars.

Wanna know how to ALWAYS get something good from this 'Bertos?  Order this:  Steak Egg and Cheese Burrito  That puppy will NEVER let you down.  Moist, tender, flavorful carne asada with fried egg (yolks cooked all the way - not runny) and artery-choking cheddar cheese.  It is a huge amount of food, and be sure to ask for 3 containers of red salsa if you are taking it "To Go" as you will need that many to have salsa with every bite.  The flavors meld together VERY WELL and this will hit both your salt craving and your protein sweet spot.  It's my favorite "fast food" burrito in town - and I've had a LOT of them over the last 15+ years of living in The PHX.  Guaranteed you will like this one, if you eat carne asada and eggs in any other setting.

Only had the garden salad and the bread sticks.  Salad was fresh, the "homemade buttermilk ranch" dressing was Top-Notch.  The bread sticks had a good flavor, not too salty, not too chewy, and the marinara sauce was very good too.  They are right beside the LA Fitness, and you can smell the Italian cooking as you are walking in or out of the gym...Yum.....:)  In fact, that's why I tried this place.  Will try the pizza at a later date.  The 26" Party Pizza for $21.99 looks perfect for large parties.

Coupla issues:  1.  First TINY basket of chips is free.  If you want a larger, second basket, it costs $1.  I can understand that policy if the chips and salsa both were COMPLETELY OFF THE HOOK! but they weren't.  2.  Had to go ask for a chip refill after the first tiny basket vanished in about 2 minutes.  They were really friendly though.  And the food was decent, but far from the best in town.  Standard rice, standard beans.  The tostadas and tacos were the best thing we tried.  There are just too many places better than this one to put it into my rotation.....

This place is getting a bad rap.  I don't know if the ownership or the menu has changed, but a co-worker and I went there today for lunch and it was top-notch in ALMOST every category.  The Bad: Red Salsa - this is just not very tasty. And as others have noted, exactly the consistency of ketchup. The Side Salad - mostly the yellow spongy and white bitter parts of an iceberg lettuce head.  Not appetizing at all.  The Mixed Bag: Service -  our waitress saw us three times - to take our drinks order, to deliver our drinks and take our food order, and to deliver our check.  The rest of the time, the "salsa and chips busboy" did all the work.  I hope he gets some shared tips, because he was the attentive one.  The Good: INSIDER TIP - ask for the Green Salsa with your chips.  This is fairly fiery and is one of the best tomatillo-based salsas you can get in a restaurant in this town, and I have been to a LOT of them in 16.5 years living here.  Really EXCELLENT salsa. The "Big Al's Plate" - this was a fine, fine entree'.  A huge, tasty grilled chicken breast, half a large avocado, two huge slices of beefsteak tomato, a good-sized dollop of cottage cheese, and the aforementioned "kinda gross" lettuce pile.  The chicken breast was cooked perfectly, just moist enough; really tasty. Side order of grilled jalapenos - two nicely-sized excellent tasting peppers. Chips with the Salsa - the chips are thin and perfectly fried.  Add some salt and you are gonna like these chips - a lot.  This place exceeded the expectations I had developed from reading the bad Yelp reviews.  Yelp almost steered me wrong in this case - don't let that happen to you.

Went there Sunday 8-29-10 with my two kiddos.  I had gone with the pure intention of trying out the supposedly fiery "Hellza-Poppin'" burger, with Pepper Jack, Jalapenos, and Habanero sauce.  I love hot and spicy foods to a fault.  The burger was indeed a little spicy.  Nothing overly hot, however, as it did not have my face sweating or have me craving a glass of milk, which REALLY hot food does to me.  If you are the dude among your friends (as I am) who is known as the "king of eating hot stuff" you might be a little disappointed in the Hellza-Poppin' burger.  Summing up the Hellza-Poppin':  Tasty, but not a volcano in your mouth.  You definitely taste the heat, but it's not overwhelmingly hot.  Unless you are a hot food wussy, in which case you should stay away from this burger.  If I were to "scale" this burger on a heat scale, basing it on other places in town you can get TRULY HOT food (Los Dos Molinos, Arriba's side order of Hatch chiles) I would have to put it on about a 6.5 out of 10.  My daughter had the original Steakenburger and was not overly impressed either.  Adding the shaved steak to the two patties did not really make the burger better.  The shaved steak actually tasted kind of stale to me when I tried it.  Maybe it was a little bit old.  The wings were very good, though.  My son had the "mild" and he loved them.  Onion rings were also above average.  We'd go back, maybe just for the wings.

I'm gonna have to lay down a star reduction for this place, unfortunately.  Had breakfast there Sunday 2-20-11.  With tip, came to $11.  Went with the protein punch, the "Carne Asada Platter" with two fried eggs.  I was hoping for some "seasoned" carne asada, which most places give you these days.  This was just a short, skinny section of over-cooked flank steak.  VERY tough.  Hard to cut with a sharp knife and hard to chew up.  Eggs and re-fried beans were nothing special.  Beans basically tasteless.  The one semi-bright spot was the salsa served with chips before the food came out.  It was good.  Not excellent, not VERY good, just....Good.  I'm gonna have to say this place is hovering between "slightly below average" and "average."  Won't be going back.

I had the broasted chicken, which was MARVELOUS.  Tender, juicy, not too much crunch but enough, not greasy at all.  This chicken is among the best fried bird I have ever tasted.  It was by far the star of the show.  The sides were not bad, but were merely unremarkable. The creamy coleslaw was just bland, the salad was forgettable, the fried onion strings were certainly decent but not the best I've had.  The service was stellar, and a couple of times "manager-looking" people strode by and asked me how everything was going.  Servers who were not even mine spoke to me in a friendly manner.  Nice experience. Go check it out.

Nothing wrong with this place. Good food (not great but darn tasty) and service is always good (not great except on occasion.)  My kids and I like to eat here in the afternoons (close to their school) because the appetizers are half-price during happy hour.  We ate for $13.51 before tip yesterday;  an adult and a 12-yr-old girl and a 14-yr-old boy.  And we all got full.  We each had an appetizer and drank water (not paying for the sodas helps keep the tab down.)  One thing I REALLY liked yesterday:  the "Salsa of the Day" was VERY, VERY good.  Had a great spicy kick, a good taste, and I ate three tubs of it myself.  Never before had they given me one this good, and I'd say we've eaten there somewhere between 8-12 times.

Fresh.  Tasty.  Interesting.  Good "People Watching."  Love everything I have tried here.  The Happy Hour "tapas" are excellent.  My daughter could not get enough of the garlic chicken one.  The 3-bean plate is delish - kinda like "meatless chili" but you don't miss the meat.     The fruit salad is massive and the fruit served with it is completely top-notch.  Wait staff is mostly cute college girls, which is hardly ever a completely bad thing.  Never had a problem with good, attentive service, which CAN be a problem sometimes.  I go eat there as often as is reasonable.  Highly Recommended.

Muy Auténtico!  Big menu, with TONS of stuff in many categories - tacos, combination plates, quesadillas, tortas, etc.  I had a "corn smut" quesadilla, and the barbacoa taco.  It was the first time I had ever tried corn smut, and I did enjoy it.  Very tasty.  The barbacoa was good, but did not have a lot of seasoning....it was on the line between "too dry and barely not too dry."  Would not order it again, and that's the only reason this little place is not a 5-star from me.  They brought a tub of cilantro, one of onions, and one of limes with my food for doctoring - nice touch you don't get from most places....  They have a little jalapeno cream salsa served with the chips and a red salsa.  When I asked the server what was in the cream sauce, she said they would not tell her - "Grandma's secret recipe."  It was DELICIOUS.  I had two tubs of it and wanted to strap a pump directly into my mouth and have it 24x7.  Great stuff.  I was the only white boy in the place, and it was packed.  Locals must love it.  I'm definitely going back.

I'm gonna have to side with the 4+ star folks on this one.  There really just *IS* something about the pizza that makes it tasty.  I couldn't identify what it was, but it just TASTES GOOD, and that's what pizza should do, right?  We had a sausage and onion, and they use red onions, a nice touch.  Everything tasted fresh and the hot wings were pretty darn good too - not too hot and not too fatty.  They are on the EAST side of the building.  I walked all the way around before I found them.  Definitely going to put them in my pizza rotation for Tempe area.

Took the kids there last night (10-21-10).  We enjoyed the food.  I had the "Chicago" pizza which had red and green bell peppers, onions, sausage.  It was very good.  I just now had the leftovers for breakfast this morning.    My daughter had the Spaghetti Calzone, and was not overwhelmed by the taste, really.  She picked at it, but said it was good - just not "blow her socks off" good.  There is all this talk by Yelp reviewers of the "sweetness" of the sauce at Spinatos, and they are correct - the sauce has a MILDLY sweet flavor.  It's not overwhelmingly sugary sweet at all.  After all the comments, I expected it to taste like tomato candy.  But it was just sorta sweet-ISH.  Some people talk about how "sweet" the sauce at Papa John's is, and I have never really noticed that sweetness.  Although I did notice the Spinatos sweetness, it did not negatively affect the taste of the pizza AT ALL.  The pizza was better for breakfast than it was for dinner last night.  :)  One other major plus:  The "Italian Bread and Butter" that is on the appetizer menu for $1.89 if worth every penny, and more.  Very fresh bread, baked daily by a local bakery, good hard brown crust, and plenty of cold tub butter to spread on it.  It was excellent.  All in all, Spinatos is indeed one of the best pizzas I have had in Phoenix - definitely in the Top Five.

This review is for the service.  First of all - the "one check per party" policy is a pain in the butt for everyone - the customers and the servers alike.  I had a particular instance with a waitress today at lunch where we tried to tell her how to pay the ticket - "This $20 bill is for this item and this item" and "This green card pays for this item and this item." etc etc.  It's a pain, and confusing.  But she messed it up, and that was not unexpected considering the policy they have to go by.  But then when we got it back and tried to explain the problem to her, she got a little snippy.  Then got a little attitudinal.    Love the food.  But this "one check per party" policy really brings the place down, and causes the servers and customers both some grief.  Not good.

I'm going to sum up my own experiences and some Pros and Cons for people from reviews already posted, to give people a good starting information point.  I had the Chop and Chick.  It was great.  If you like breakfast pork chops, this one is top of the line.  The breads and jellies are great too.  The hash browns, crispy and buttery.  What I did not like is getting FLAT OUT RIPPED OFF with the TINY, TINY glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice they offer for $2.50.  I mean it's literally only about 3-4 ounces.  Tiny.  Grossly overpriced.  It's like they priced it like that to DISSUADE people from buying it.  Hate this about Matt's.  Pros:  Fresh, local ingredients, well-prepared and tasty. Many people say this is the best restaurant breakfast they have had, or among the best. People LOVE the buttery, crisp hash browns, and the home fries get a lot of praise also. Although the wait can be long, many people say it's totally worth it.  Cons: The wait can be soul-crushingly long.  The place is TINY. Stupidly overpriced orange juice. Fresh-squeezed, but JEEZ !!! Tiny parking lot also.  So, ingest all that info, and decide if Matt's is for you.    Happy Yelping !!!

Gonna have to rain on the breakfast parade a little bit, I'm afraid.  I'm on an unofficial mission to try all the great or very good or excellent breakfast joints in the Phoenix area.  On my Yelp search for a Sunday breakfast, I hit on Cafe ZuZu and decided to give it a try.  I wish I hadn't done that.  $27 later, I couldn't wait to get home to eat after the meal.  In order and succinctly:  Spicy Bloody Mary - decent tasting, albeit not very SPICY at all.  Came with a full stalk of celery, a wedge of lime AND lemon, and two olives. Problem:  it was MOSTLY ICE.  I got about 6-7 good pulls on the straw and it was empty.  And there sat a full glass of ice, stuffed in the glass top to bottom.  Look - I know MOST places do this, and at times I have even asked for NO ICE in my Bloody Mary.  I guess I'm going to have to make that a solid habit.  I don't like getting so obviously ripped off.  I work hard for my money, and I don't appreciate having to pay $6.50 for 75 cents worth of Bloody Mary contents.  Side of Thick Cut Virginia Bacon - very nice taste, cooked about right.  This was the highlight of the meal.  Breakfast Casserole - my SORE point, even more-so than the Bloody Mary.  It was advertised in the menu as this: "sweet Italian sausage, roasted potatoes, bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes + cheddar, topped with a poached egg (or substitute sour cream for egg)"  All that WAS true.  But here's the MAJOR PROBLEM:  the amount of "sweet Italian sausage" was about the size of two quarters.  I'm not kidding.  There were 4 thinly sliced slivers of sausage, about the thickness and size of half a quarter dollar each.  That was it for the sausage.  The dish was SMALL too, about the size of my hand and not much thicker.  It was mostly green, red, and yellow bell pepper.  Mushrooms were good, what there were of them. The roasted potatoes portion consisted of about 3 medium-sized potato wedges.  Here's how they made it:  Cut all the veggies,add the two tiny slices of sausage, and cover it with cheddar.  Nuke, then add a poached egg on top.  It was something I could make at my house, but never would, because there was no seasonings involved.  Just the ingredients, smothered with melted cheddar.  Not creative, and not very tasty at ALL.  Felt ripped off at $11.75.  Ambiance and setting was good. The facility is nice.  The service was good.  The food and the lack of value are what ruined this meal.  But if you can't bring me some tasty. memorable (in a GOOD way) food, then I'm not going to be coming back.

My third time here, but the first as a Yelper.  Buddy and I hit PMM up for lunch, with a restaurant.com gift cert offering $25 off, minimum purchase of $35 required.  He had the "Combo Plate" which came with a nice chunk of real steak, a crispy ground beef taco, a cheese enchilada, beans, and rice.  He enjoyed it all.  Nice portion and all of it tasted good.  I had the Rib-eye soft tacos.  They were top notch.  The beef was obviously grilled and had some charred flavor to it.    Salsa, with a green and a red, and chips, light and crispy, were excellent.  I like this place.  Priced a little higher than most, but so is the taste.

Everything here is relatively tasty.  Nothing we have tried has been bland, with one exception:  That dang watery salsa that comes with the complimentary chips.  The salsa has a decent taste, what little taste it has; nothing bad can be said about the taste. But the consistency is just awful.  Completely chunkless.  And fairly bland.  Service is super fast.  No, really, I mean ULTRA FAST.  You'll get your food generally in under 5 minutes, unless it's a steak which has to be cooked for a while to get done.  This place would get 5 stars easy if they improved the salsa.  I take my teens here a lot.

Very nice little chef-run cafe.  Pastries are marvelous.    I had the Big Breakfast, was fairly tasty.  The sausage wasn't "all that" if you ask me - it seemed a little blander than I expected.  The potato cake did need some seasoning, maybe like rosemary or thyme.  Eggs were perfect, and mushrooms were awesome.  Very nice decor and feeling.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  I'll go back.  For breakfast, Matt's and Over Easy are both better food.  But the "essence" of this cafe is the pastries.  Can't go wrong with any of them.  P.S.  This review was modified to 4 stars from the initial 3 after a couple of additional visits.  They get BIG PROPS for the freshness of the food.  The inside is TINY though, and the waits can be fairly long-ish if the place is filled up.

Had the breakfast special on 9-17-11:  sausage and biscuit with mushroom gravy and sausage, and two fried eggs.  YUMMY.    With the economy where it is, the dish reflected the smaller portions you would expect for such tasty food at $8.95.  I ate the plate of food, wanted to lick the remaining juices off the plate (managed to restrain myself) and complimented them on the way out, with a Chocolate croissant in my hand.  Still really great food, but if you have a huge appetite you might want to order a side dish also, as the portion is fairly small.  Just as a reminder to other reviewers, because I'm a friendly guy who likes people to  understand things which I understand:  Essence sells M-A-C-A-R-O-N-S.  The do not sell MacarOOns.  Only one "O" at the end.

Gonna have to up this one star after my second visit.  Went back for lunch with one of my lunch Amigas and it was a good experience.  Salsa was yummalicious and the chips were warm, crunchy, and fresh.  The homemade tortillas were totally yummy.  I had the Carne Asada w/grilled shrimps.  Steak was thin and didn't have a lot of seasoning, but was T-E-N-D-E-R which is a rare find in a Mexican food place.  Most steaks are tough, and many of them have gristle.  Good to know this one is top-notch.  Beans were good, salad was decent, rice was fairly blah.  The one knock this time was service - again, like last time, the servers were slow to respond to an empty salsa bowl and an empty water glass.  Above average joint, but still not quite in the same class as Mariscos Playa Hermosa, which is my #1 Mexican Seafood stop in the PHX.

The pastys (pasties) are decent, at least the ones I have tried.  The Walnut Mushroom Soup is about as tasty a veggie-based soup that you will find in this town.  Heavenly.  It's so rich that I get it in the "cup" size, since I think the bowl size would be sensory overload.  Go there just to try the soup - seriously - it's that good.

Short and to the point:  Excellent Happy Hour "half-off" prices on appetizers, and all of them we chose were good-to-excellent.  My son and I got a TON of food, and I drank a Bloody Mary, and with food to take home and two very full tummies, we paid $30 including tip.  Prices are reasonable to say the least.  Gonna take the kids back again on another Friday.  Parking kinda tight in the busiest times.

Let's reverse the trend and go with "BAD" first, followed by GOOD.  Two things keep this place from garnishing 5 stars:  1.  The chicken fingers are sometimes actually a DIFFERENT STYLE from the last time you ate there.  That happened to me.  I took my kids there, and the strips were PERFECT - thick and meaty, crunchy, not too salty, completely awesome.  THUS, I bragged to my co-workers and took them.  THAT TIME, the strips were actually a DIFFERENT strip - not nearly as thick, with less meat, more on the "flat" style of strip.  That bothered me  - a lot.  After bragging that this place had the "best chicken strips EVER" we got there and they were fairly pedestrian strips.  Not good.  2.  They charge a fee for paying with plastic.  I know, they have to pay fees and they are just collecting their fee in advance, rather than pay it out of their own pocket, but it's still an annoyance.  Better to add 1 cent to every item and get your fees back that way I think.  It just leaves a bad taste in my mouth paying a fee for using a card.  Now, the GOOD:  As many other reviewers have stated, the strips (when you get the GOOD ones) are totally delicious and completely awesome.  They WILL rank with the best you have ever had unless you were raised by a chicken chef.  The point of this place is Chicken Strips.  If you love them, and get the good, meaty ones, enjoy.    The fries are above decent also.  Just don't pay with plastic, and HOPE the strips are not the flat ones, and you are in business.

Update:  Solid 4.5 stars.  Have gone back 7 or 8 times total, and after my review mentioning the "alternate strips," they have served nothing but the GOOD ONES.  Maybe they had to use a different source that one day, or I got a bad batch, or whatever.  But since then, the strips have been PRIMO and everything there is fresh and fried heaven.  Go try it - you'll like it !!!

Had the  Dynamite Sandwich, which is described as so on the website:    "An explosive blend of sliced brisket, peppers, chilis, onions and jalapeños, sauteed with Red Diamond sauce, and piled on a jalapeño roll with melted pepperjack."  It was very good, very spicy, and I'm definitely getting more of them.  Our favorite item was the Fried Onion Strings, however.  You know the problems with ordering onion rings at a restaurant:  too much breading, or the onion is nasty, or you take a bite and all the onion pulls out of the breading and you have nothing left to eat except empty breading, or they are too greasy?  These don't have any of those problems.  Very light crust, super-light, and the onions can be tasted and they are good onions, not too strong or too sweet.  No grease at all.  We loved them for $1.95 and next time I'm ordering more of them, since the plate is a little on the small side.  That's my only complaint - the portions were a little on the small side.  But you can remedy that by going back on the FIRST WEDNESDAY of every month, when they have a $12.95 AYCE lunch buffet.  One last problem - they are only open for lunch, and weekdays only.  Hours: 10:30am - 3:00pm Monday - Friday.  If they'd expand hours and make their portions a smidgeon larger, I could give them 5 stars.

I'd have to agree with most reviews.  This is a nice little breakfast joint.  I had the Ajo Wrap and a side of AZ Potatoes (home fries) and paid $8.54.  Very reasonable price at a time when a good breakfast in Phoenix can easily add up to $15 per person.  They were both tasty and fresh.  The potatoes had some little pieces of green and red bell pepper mixed in, so that added a little extra to the overall flavor.  The wrap had a good bit of chorizo and the eggs tasted fresh.  The atmosphere has a good vibe (other than the one family in there eating among which there existed one or more of them who needed a shower.  I think that was the exception, not the rule, however.)  I'd definitely rate this among the Top 15 breakfasts in town.

Gonna have to give this place a big ole' fat "MEH."  My son had the "Turbo BLT" or whatever they called it.  The cheddar cheese overwhelmed the taste - my son had to take it off the bread.  The "avocado" advertised was some kind of tasteless guacamole paste.  I had the Beef & Gorgonzola sammich.  Nothing remarkable about it - it was basically flavorless.  I usually judge sammich places by asking myself, "Can I easily make a better sammich than this myself in my own kitchen?"  The answer today for both sammiches was a resounding "HECK YES."  The coconut pie was good.  Not great, just good.  I can't see a return trip in my future.  P.S.  Overhearing a young employee telling another one "I got my period today" and having the other one reply "I did too" does not seem very professional.  I understand how perfectly natural that conversation is - but as an employee on the job, you really shouldn't have customers  overhearing that sort of thing, should you?  UPDATE:  The founder contacted me and refunded my money.  And gave me a $20 gift card.  I'm going back to give them another shot.  Good business practice, standing behind and defending the company like that.  To be admired.  More companies should be so proactive.  Kudos.

Excessively cute.  Majorly Fresh.  Tasty (almost) to the Max.  I had the Asparagus Panini and added ham to it.  It was delicious.  I even tricked my son into eating half of it, and he does not like asparagus at all.  SCORE ONE FOR CHILD NUTRITION !!!  The Club sandwich was...well...a little bit average.  I know some of you have raved about it, but I'd give it only about a 6.5 and the Panini about a 9.2 on a 10 scale.  The only reason Bertha's does not get the 5th star is that the Cream Cheese Brownie was not better than the Pillsbury ones I can make myself at home.  We shall return, and more than once.  Kudos !!!

As for "fast food" burgers, these are decent.  The BURGERS at least.  The fries?  Please.  They are AWFUL.  Let them get cold and they are WORSE THAN AWFUL.  Anyone who says these are "the best burgers they have ever had" has just not tried enough good burgers yet.  Try Lobby's.  Or Chuckbox.  Or Hillside Spot.  Or Deluxe.  Or Roaring Fork.  In-N-Out has decent "fast food" burgers.  But are they the BEST BURGERS ANYWHERE?  Not a chance.

Overpriced is the first word that comes to mind.  And the word that dominates my feelings toward this place.  They never mentioned that the "KING" in the name actually  means you have to be as RICH as a REAL KING to afford to eat here.  $13.95 for a ( relatively forgettable ) simple oyster Po' Boy with 5 oysters on it and a side of fries?   Yep.  Who's dumber - me for paying it, or them for charging it?  I think Me.  When I saw the price, I should have just closed the menu and left.  I also had a $6.95 "Cajun Bloody Mary" which had nothing Cajun about it, as far as I could tell.  It was mostly ice, served in a 16-oz glass.  So maybe about 6 ounces of "drink material" inside.  It lasted about as long as it took me to take 5 drinks out of it.  Let's do the math:  At $6.95, with 6 ounces of substance, that comes to $148.26 per gallon.    So at least I can say I had a Bloody Mary which came in at around $148 a gallon.  I will never, EVER go back to that place.  And if you do go, bring the credit card with the highest available balance, because you are gonna need it.  P.S.  A manager attempted to contact me after seeing this review, trying to make things right for me.  I understand their prices reflect the "going rate" for fresh seafood in the desert.  I've upped the star from 1 to 2 to reflect the respect for management for trying to contact me and make things right.  Kudos for that.  P.S.P.S.  I had Pete's Fish and Chips the other day, and I realized that their fried oysters are the EXACT SAME ONES which are served at King's Fish House.  So if you want to know what these fried oysters taste like, eat at Pete's.  You can get about 15 oysters there for the King's price.

Short and sweet:  Staff was very friendly.  Phoenix Burger - fairly decent bar burger.  Nothing to write home about. Coleslaw - inedible.  I don't know what their seasoning of choice is, but it was gross. Steak Fries - pretty decent version. Potato Salad - wanted to try it, but they were "out."  Friday lunch, and you're out? Wow.  All in all, not planning a return trip unless nothing else is open.  They must sell a LOT of beer on weekends, though, because kegs and cases were being brought in by the hand-truck-load when we were there.

I went for AZ Restaurant Week and got the $39 special.    I went with the Roasted Lobster and Corn Bisque: Tempura Cream Corn, Spicy Apples as my 1st course, the Kobe Flat Iron Steak: Bone Marrow Potatoes, Three Way Onions, Pinot Noir Reduction as the entree' and the Seasonal Berry Parfait: Honey Granola, Frozen Yogurt as dessert.   Sadly, overall, my expectations were not met by the food or the ambiance - only by the AWESOME service.   The complimentary duck fat french fries were definitely above average.  I could not really tell anything about them that screamed "DUCK FAT !!!" but the seasonings on the fries and the sauces were all very tasty.  Not bad for "free" food !!!  The "potato sponge bread" or whatever that was they brought to the table was very "meh."  Bland almost.  Forgettable.  The lobster and corn bisque was tasty and deserves a "Bravo!"  Met my expectations, maybe exceeded it a little bit.   The Kobe Flat Iron, however, fell flat (pun intended.)  I have prepared a Kobe NY strip (which I purchased at A.J.'s Fine Foods for $39/lb.) at home on my grill that tasted better than the dish I got from Bourbon Steak.     One would expect a Kobe steak to "wow!" you when you take that first bite and also that last bite, and in this case, it just did not happen.  The steak was not particularly flavorful, and was not particularly tender.  The onions overpowered the dish a bit, leaving me with a strong and unpleasant "onion" taste in my mouth for the rest of the night.  My advice on Kobe steak:  if you want an affordable Kobe experience, hit A.J.'s and grill it yourself at home.  The Berry Parfait was totally tasty.  Great ending for the meal - super-fresh fruit chunks, everything worked together very well.  I'd pay $8 for that on a menu.  The place was very loud.  It was only about half full, but the sound reverberates in that place.  Tables are close together so you get to hear your neighbor's conversations, barely, above the overall din.  The SERVICE WAS SPECTACULAR.  Within 5 minutes of sitting down, I had my order placed, water to drink, and duck fat fries on the table.  They never let me sit there waiting around for water, or to remove a completed dish - they were ALL over it like a good team.  I'd bet 6 or 7 different people served my table.  Service definitely was the best part of the experience.  So, in summary:  Would I take a date there and spend $150 per person?  NO.  Would I take advantage of another $39 special next year and try something new?  Quite possibly, yes.

Solid 4.5 stars.  Had the Soy Chocolate Chili, and it was THE BOMB.  BOMB I say.  Went down cold, then left a spicy BITE in the mouth.  I loved it.  I'm getting more of it you can bet.  Nicely priced, lots of flavor and style and size choices, very clean store, very nice employees/owners.  If you like Gelato, this place won't let you down in ANY way.

CLOSED.  Sadly.  As of 10-27-2011, CLOSED FOR BUSINESS.    The Basha's in their strip closed, and that wiped out a lot of their business.  Too Bad.  Nice people, selling a great product the right way.  Darn.

Service is good and friendly also.  Each of us got a personal greeting when we walked in the door.  We went with a 4-person lunch crew, and we ALL liked EVERYTHING we ordered.  The fried fish was crispy and flaky-tender.  Onion rings, we could smell the beer batter.  Potato salad made in house.  Pastrami and cheese sammich was a winner.  Green chili burro was good, but the "red chile" bowl that came with it was even better.  Portion sizes are a good value and taste is even better.  If you are in the area, you should stop by and give these nice ladies some business - we need more places like this to stick around !!  P.S.  Corrected info.

This is pretty much my second favorite Messican Seafood restaurant in town, behind Mariscos Playa Hermosa.   I usually have the platter of fried fish pieces - Snapper Chicharrón.   It comes on a bed of salad, with an order of shrimp-stuffed yellow Anaheim peppers soaking in a soy-sauce-based concoction.  Hard to describe, but easy to LOVE.  As another reviewer said, their little orange, creamy, chipotle-flavored sauce is indeed SUPER DELICIOUS.  It's good on just about anything.  My one minor qualm:  The chips and salsa are not great.  The salsa is watery and thin, with not much flavor.  The chips are forgettable.  If you can get past the sub-par chips and salsa, this place is great.

Ate there with my kids 3-17-2011.    Gonna go with 3.75 stars overall, rounded up to 4.  Service was good, prompt, polite, and efficient, and the place was clean and tidy.  4.5 stars for those items.  We had:  Side Caesar salad:  My daughter thought the dressing was a little bit, in her words, "sour."  I tried it, and maybe it was a little bit on the "tart" side.  Veggies were fresh and crunchy though, so it was not a total loss.  3.5 stars.  Chicken Basil Chili in a sourdough Boule:   fairly tasty, IMHO.  My son thought it was a little bland, but his tastes are kinda weird.  I tried it, and I thought it was good.  The sourdough was fresh and good. 3.0 stars.  Side of meatballs with marinara sauce:  The star of the meal.  Very tasty sauce, and the meat was firm and tasted how a meatball is supposed to taste, in both texture and seasonings.  4.5 stars for this dish.  I had the "Gorgonzola Pasilla Chile Penne - creamy alfredo, white wine, pasilla chile flakes, crushed red pepper, red peppers, gorgonzola and arugula $7.99"   It was good.  Could have used some MEAT - maybe I could have added chicken to it, but I failed to notice it was meatless when I ordered it - MY BAD !!   I'd have it again if it had chicken in it.  It was a nicely seasoned and prepared dish.  4.0 stars.  All in all, a MUCH better trip than my first one.  I might have to give them a couple more visits to make sure.... :)

Very tasty Mediterranean Chicken pita.  I get that almost every time.  Very nice-sized portion of seasoned and juicy chicken breast meat.  I have had other items too, and they are all tasty.    Place gets busy at lunch on weekdays (a lot of office space nearby) so you might have a 5-10 minute wait.  Fries are good when HOT, but very generic, and if they get cold they are worthless.  If the fries were better, I'd give it 5 Stars.

Very nice upscale deli counter.  My daughter had the Spaghetti with Marinara and added three meatballs.  She loved it.  They also had "free" chocolate-dipped strawberries and chocolate mini-cupcakes the day we were there, celebrating I think they said their 2-yr anniversary.  They were delish.  We will definitely return at some future date and spend some more money.

Went with 3 co-workers to the Wednesday lunch buffet, which always features Prime Rib.  The star of the show is the Prime Rib.  It was DELISH and was the main thing that makes this worth the $15 buffet charge.  There was a sandwich station with various cold cuts to build your sammiches, a salad bar, and a "hot food" bar with 4 different "meat/veggie" combinations.  All those were just so-so, nothing to wow anyone.  But the Prime Rib Carving Station was TOP notch.  Worth every penny of the cost.  The desserts were fairly mundane (brownies, pecan pie, 4 kinds of cookies) with the exception being a Strawberry Cheesecake Parfait which was delumptious.    We will likely be going back on future Wednesdays.

I've given this place two tries.  I forgot how "bleh" it was the first time and tried it again.  Still bleh.  "Country Potatoes" are almost without flavor at all.  I had the Spicy Mexican skillet the first time.  Fairly tasty, but nothing about it wowed me.  I had the Greek omelet this time, and it again failed to stimulate the taste buds.  A little over-done on the outside, and nothing overly tasty about the overall presentation.  I left half of it on the plate, along with most of the potatoes.    I can't recommend this place at all.

Catfish and Okra are the stars of this show.  The fries, potato salad, and the chicken strips were run-of-the-mill.  But the catfish (I tried only the spicy) was OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS.  Okra breading was not thick at ALL, which allows you to taste not only the fried breading but also the taste of the okra itself, which is a rare combination.  I love this place, and if you enjoy spicy food and fried catfish, hit this spot - you won't be disappointed.

Seems to be a recurring theme that the owner/manager of this particular branch is rude to customers.  The ONE star is for her attitude.  Maybe she should read Yelp and get her act together.  I love NBC, but the only one I have used is the one in 'Tukee.  I'd advise that one if you want good, polite service.  The Chocolate Chocolate Chip cake is AWESOME.    And the Red Velvet is above decent, also.  Prices are high, but worth it in taste.  The food is 4.5 stars for sure.

Excellent food in a quaint/cute little place.  I had the Chicken Avocado Croissant.  VERY tasty.  The second half of the sandwich was even better the next day after a night in the fridge.  The home fries were cut in a very unusual way and tasted great.  Ice cream deli in there too with a bunch of good flavors to choose from.  Highly recommended !!

Went with a party of 8 on Sunday 03-25-2012.  ( We had been going to Iguana Mack's actually, but it was closed for renovations, so we went next door to Dos Gringos. )  The place is really nicely decorated and "fun" from a setup point of view.  Welded Mexican statues, Christmas lights strung around, etc.  They put an effort into decorations that's for sure.  We sat in an area that was covered patio (sorta) and the wind was blowing and the clouds were blocking the sun.  The patio experience was really pretty awesome - one of the best I've had in the Valley after moving here in 1995.  They were short-staffed, and a bartender was our waiter. (sigh)  This can be good or bad, and I guess he did OK considering he was covering about 8 people at the bar too.  Took F.O.R.E.V.E.R. for the food to get to us.  I mean, like 45 minutes or maybe a tad longer.  A couple of times, we ran out of soda/water/beer and had to wait a while for him to notice.  When the food FINALLY arrived, there were instant problems.  The beans had a "hard coating" over the top, an indication that they sat under a heat lamp for a WHILE.  All the food was at best barely warm, and most of it was virtually cold.  One order was wrong, so it got taken back and replaced.  (At least ONE of us got hot food !! )  We ate without complaint at that point because we were starving.  So, with all these problems, "why 4 stars?" you might ask me.  Read on:  When it came time for the bill, we told the waiter/bartender about the problems and he sent the manager, Jim, over to talk to us.  We nicely explained the issue, mentioned that we did enjoy most of the flavor of the food, but that most of it was cold and obviously had sat there ready to bring out to us for a very LONG time.  He said he'd take "some stuff off" then returned with a bill for.... .......... ........ ...... .... wait for it.... .... ...... ........ .......... a grand total of $5.50.  That's "Five Dollars and Fifty Cents."  He only charged us for the two beers.  All the food was comped.  Eight people got free food.  Now THAT, other restaurant managers, is the way to achieve "future customer loyalty" right there.  We are going to tell EVERYONE about the good treatment we received and the correct way the manger handled it.  We would have been happy with him taking 2 or three of the dishes off there, but to give us ALL the food for free?  Excellent public relations move.  We will be back to eat there again.  Multiple times.  Hopefully on days when they are fully staffed !!!

This review will be similar to a scolding I might give my kid when he comes home with 5 A's and 1 B.  I know you are doing GREAT, but you CAN improve !!! :)  I can see where all the love comes from.  The food sold here tastes "fresh and home-made" for sure.  But not too much I have had here (and I have eaten there 4 times now) has really made me say, "Wow, this is some of the best food around."  The salsas and guacamole are very good.    The carne asada does have a very nice taste - however, it's shown a tendency to be a little bit (just the tiny, TINIEST BIT) dry on occasion.  The chips (served room temperature and costing $1.50) are store-bought and not up to par with the rest of the food.  The charro beans are definitely among the top contenders in the Valley.  I'd up this to a 5-star if they'd fry their own chips, or change to a style they can serve warm, and maybe leave some of the juice in the carne asada.  A nice place to eat.  A smidge away from about as fresh as food can taste.

My tween and my teen and I really like this public pool.  They have a "high" diving board, which I love, with it being a reminder of my childhood hometown swimming days.  Two different play pools areas for older kids, one which has a basketball goal.  Three lap lanes for exercise swimming.  A slide, plus two large play areas for the little kids including a zero depth entry for the smallest of tots.  Three different shade areas for people who don't want to "bake" in the sun.  If they added a "hot food" concession stand, this place would be virtually perfect.

This is a great little place.  They have almost as many dessert options as they have food, which is unusual in itself.  Check the website menu for a full list.  We had the rib-eye tacos and the Cubano torta.  Both very very tasty and a good value for the price, and both were very well-seasoned and yummy.  Big chunks of avocado on each taco, and a salsa bar with a lot of good options.  They also have.... . . . get this... . . . chocolate covered strawberries for 75 cents each.  One of the best values on THAT product that you will find anywhere.  It was clean and shiny in there too, and open, and overall just a pleasant ambiance.  Definitely a spot I will return to, probably many times.  Highly recommended !!!

Went based on a Yelp search.  Asked for the "Yelp Deal" and the girl gave me a "what is that?"  I then had to explain the offer.  Minus half a star.  Employees should know the offers, right?  Not too high an expectation, right?  OK - the facility.  It was Spic-N-Span clean.  Shiny.  Spotless.  Looks like Mr. Clean lives here.  Extra half a star for that.  Not many people's HOMES are even this clean.  We ordered for 3:  Burger, Italian Beef (Hot), and Chili Dog, 2 Fries, 3 drinks.  Total was $19.94 with the BOGO offer from Yelp.  Nice price for the three of us.  The Food:  The burger was well-built, a little on the medium-size range, not too full of stuff as to overwhelm the bun.  Good composition.  Taste was given a serious "2 thumbs up" from my 14-yr-old son.  He did comment on the "secret sauce" which was a surprise to him, but which tasted fine.  ( Possibly a combo of Ranch and ketchup. )  The Italian Beef was very good.  It was tender meat, not too mushy and not too firm, just enough juice to not soggify the bun.  You could taste the spices, but I'm hard-pressed to tell you what they were.  The "Hot" version of the peppers were your standard-fare (pickled?) peppers, not very much heat but a LITTLE bit of kick.  Portion size was on the large side - a hungry man would eat it all, but someone with a lesser appetite might have some to take home.  Not stingy AT ALL on the meat portion, but could have used a few more peppers.  Maybe I ask for "extra peppers" next time.  Fries:  As other Yelpers have stated, they are "crinkle cut" but they are a VERY EXCELLENTLY PREPARED version of crinkles.  Perfect crunch on the outside, airy potato on the inside.  I challenge anyone to find a better version of crinkle-cut fries at any restaurant in Phoenix.  Not the "best fries EVER" but definitely tasty and about as well-cooked as this type of fry can be.  The Chili Dog:  Weak spot here, but not too bad.  Other Yelpers raved about the chili, and it might be good on occasion - but on our visit, it was standard hot-dog-topping chili, nothing to make it stand out.  It was not greasy, so that was a plus, but neither did it make us say, "Dang, that's some good chili right thar !!!"  Bun nothing special, and neither was the dog itself.  My daughter only ate about half of it.  Drinks:  Gigantic cups, with a fountain you serve to yourself.  I had the Black Tea and it was decent.  All in all, a very good place to eat.  Clean, well-lit, and mostly excellent food.  We WILL be going back.   They get a solid SOLID 4.5 stars.  Thanks Lobby's !!!!

After hitting Lobby's again yesterday for about the 40th time, I just want to reiterate how yummy the burgers and the chicken sandwich are.  Not to mention the best frozen crinkle-cut fries you will ever get at a restaurant.  Sitting there Pavlov-dogging while waiting for my mouth to finish the current bite of the burger so I could take another bite, I said to my daughter, "Anyone who thinks In-N-Out burgers are better than THIS needs to have their taste buds scientifically tested for functionality."  Or something very close to meaning that, anyway.  I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich (full ACTUAL chicken breast, not a patty or a processed hunk of grossness but a real boneless breast) with the hot peppers and it is totally delish.  Huge piece of tasty grilled meat, never dry, never overcooked, never "scary pink" in the middle.  Just right.  My recommendation to anyone who has a bad experience at Lobby's is to go back and try again.  I'd bet my bottom dollar it was a rare occurrence.  Like I said in the intro, after about 40 visits, my kids and I have had nothing but excessive bouts of yumminess when visiting Lobby's.  My 15-yr-old son has eaten at most of the good burger joints in town, and Lobby's is the burger he asks for most often.  In-N-Out has it's place in history, and for good reasons, it does good business.  But I've never had anything there which even closely approaches the flavor and juiciness of what Lobby sells.  And the fries?  Not even a contest.  Frozen crinkle-cut fries at Lobby's are better than those starch-sticks which In-N-Out sells for fries.  Is it "gourmet foodie" quality?  No.  But it doesn't have to be that kind of burger to taste great.  CAVEAT:  My opinion obviously means no more than one person's educated opinion.  So please don't jump on my case for dissing In-N-Out.  They have their place in the fast-food chain.  But Lobby's is in a different class.

Ate there last evening with the kiddos.  It was early (4 PM) and the place was nearly empty.  My daughter ordered the Derby salad with added grilled chicken.  She liked it, but it had too much Blue Cheese for her tastes.  The Blue Cheese was in really large chunks, and very tasty.  If you like Blue cheese, you will enjoy this salad.  The boy and I shared a cheeseburger and fries.  The burger was VERY good.  Puts it in the Top 7 or 8 burgers I've had in Phoenix.  Hard to say what was great about it - it just had a good charbroiled taste (nothing like Burger King's "fake" charbroil taste) and the ingredients melded well together.  The bun was also outstanding - toasted and crunchy on the burger side and freshly soft on the outside.  The fries were "so-so."  We also shared the Guacamole and chips.  This was a weak point.  The chips were bland, and the Guaca was too chunky for dipping - you basically had to use a utensil and scoop the Guaca onto the chip to eat it.  The Guaca had I think little chunks of mandarin orange in there, which did nothing for the overall taste.  My son spit out his first bite and did not try it again.  A nice experiment, but I don't think a good one.  The kids drank Mexican bottled Coke, always a big fave.  All in all, we hit home runs on two of the three items, so that's a good percentage.

It started as a low vibration in my mouth.  Then it became a little more of a low-volume Hum.  Then my teeth started rattling, just a little bit.  I went and looked in the mirror into my opened mouth, and it hit me as to what was happening.  My taste buds were.....what?.....chanting......????  All I heard was tiny little echo of  "We Are Not Worthy.....We Are Not Worthy" over and over again, building to a crescendo, then stopping abruptly.   Then they took a low bow.  This was right after eating the Mardi-Gras-inspired Comte ~ ham ~ celery root rémoulade crêpe from TGF today.  It was seriously one of the best things to ever cross my taste buds.  This truck is worthy of the hype.  Some aren't - but this one IS.  I've still yet to get a taste of the duck fat fries - went too early once, and this time I was too late as they were sold out.  Darnedest luck.  Go out of your way to visit these nice folks and their other-worldly crêpes.  You will not be disappointed.

I can only comment about the "Hard Chicken Tacos" since that is all that I have tried. But I have had them 4 times, and all 4 times they were great.  It's not easy to find "good hard tacos" in Phoenix.  Fast food chicken tacos are ALL crappy.  Some or most of the "Mexican" food restaurants try to fry their own corn tortillas and fold them into taco shells ( /Fail ) or just sell "rolled tacos."  These at Federicos are good taco shells which don't fall apart from the first bite, and don't get "soggy on the bottom" too soon.  The meat has a very good flavor - not too salty and not too spicy, but definitely not drab or bland.  Price is good too.  They run a special where you can get 5 tacos and a drink for like $5.29 or something.  It's crazy cheap, and the portions are not small.  It's my "go-to spot" for hard tacos.

This is a great little place.  I'm no Thai expert, but the food was very tasty.   The little manager/owner lady was super-attentive and very nice in all regards.  Had the lunch buffet, and ate until I was stuffed, for $10.79.  There were about 6-8 items available on the buffet, but she also would ask if she could bring you other dishes from the menu, whatever she has ready to go on that day.  For example, she brought us two chicken kabobs which were juicy and flavorful.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, the dessert is totally delectable !!  Sticky rice, pumpkin custard, and coconut ice cream.  It's an amazing combo, and my only complaint was that the pumpkin custard portion was a little small.  I could have eaten about 3 of those dessert bowls, even after stuffing on the Thai buffet.  I will go back - you should go too !!

Excellent job at doing what they do.  Don't think I've had better Crème Brûlée anywhere in the Valley.  ( Maybe The Farm Kitchen at South Mountain's butternut squash Crème Brûlée would give them a run for the money. )  Anyway, I drove about 15 miles to get this food, and I bought 4 flavors - chocolate, vanilla, lavender, and pumpkin.  All were drool-worthy.  I'll be back to this truck...somewhere...sometime...:)

New owner not FULLY honoring "Entertainment Book 2012" coupons.  Full Disclosure:  They did give us $5 off instead of $12.  But the food was totally bland.  One dish, the main meat was WAY WAY WAY too salty.  The other two dishes were so bland it was impossible to pick out what individual spices were in the meal.  And the amount of food for the price was lacking - too little food, too much dollar bill.  Won't be back.

Meh.  Seems to be a little expensive for what you get.  Nothing "wowed" me at all.  Many places similar to this one give you better food, and more of it for your money.  By the way - I tried this place TWICE and had same experience both times.

Have to add my fine regards to this little truck.  I had the "Devil Dog" and it was indeed fairly spicy.  And I'm the guy in my group who loves it "so hot my face sweats" so when I say something is fairly spicy, it's not going to be for the faint of tongue.  Good bargain for what you get.  The Naan bread made for a "different" kind of "Hot Dog" for sure.  All the fillings were fresh and added to the overall taste instead of getting overpowered by any one ingredient.  I'll definitely hit this truck again in the future.  Good Job !!!

I must add my 5-star recommendation to this marvelous little establishment.  And it is little  - 5 or 6 tables.  As others have said, the "free sample" is very tasty.   And the people running the place are genuinely nice people.  I had the Pork Schnitzel with morel mushroom sauce, side of dill mashed potatoes, and my three choices of salad were spinach with garlic vinaigrette, tomato and basil salad, and green peas.  It was about $12 with tax.  VERY yummy.  I wiped my plate clean.  One MINOR negative issue:  The mashed potatoes could have used a little more butter.  They were a tad (small tad) dry-ish.  But there was plenty of mushroom gravy to soak them in, so it made up for that.  So that's why the place still gets 5 stars, even with a minor issue.  i will go back soon with my kiddos and introduce them to this very good little place to eat.  Oh - and while I was in there, three college-aged young gentlemen had just wrapped up their meal and were complimenting the chef for the awesomeness of their meals.  Always good to see that.  Go eat there - you won't be disappointed.

Following up on the recent review by another Yelper:  This is not a "fast food sit-down" experience.  Food is cooked when you order, by a small but caring staff, and the dishes come out when they are ready.    Nothing is going to sit for a while under a heat lamp until every dish for that table is ready.  It's more of a "sit down and stay a while" experience, especially if there are several groups in the place at the time.  So, adapt accordingly, and you will love the food here and the people who run the place just like all the other 5-star reviewers before you.

Very nice people running the place.  That goes a long way.  The food was very tasty.  I had the pork chop with two sunny side up eggs and the home fries and wheat toast.  It's definitely above average.  I'd say better than most but a step below Matt's and Over Easy.  The place is all "50's upped" and pipes in Sirius 50's music.  Nice little decor setup, and it was clean.  Will definitely eat there again.

Have to give this place some serious love. Went with my 15-yr-old son and enjoyed the place a lot.  Ground Beef Tacos - totally scrumptious.  Best thing we had.  They do hard tacos RIGHT. Pernil Pork Tacos - very tasty also.  Tender meat some super-tasty seasonings. Chips and Salsa - way above average. Service - excellent in every way, friendly and there when we needed something. Black Beans and Rice - a little more seasoned than you usually get.  Definitely going to hit 'em up again.  The only drawbacks were that the price is a little higher than normally expected, but they have a huge lease payment I'm sure, with that location.  And the parking is a pain too - ticketed (free with validation however) garage only or across the street.

Just a quick update on something I tried on my most recent visit:  The sauce served with the sweet potato fries is the best s.p.f. sauce I've ever tasted.  I'd go back JUST for that side dish, except everything else is good also.

Everything was fairly yummy.  I wonder if it's a LITTLE bit overpriced though.   I paid $43 for a salad, a rice bowl, and 3 paninis. The Paninis are kinda on the small side, but the flavors really POP and the food is definitely fresh.   The paninis were better on the morning after, having the leftovers.  Heated it in the micro for 30 seconds and it really brought all the flavors out better than eating the other half on the first day did.  I'd skip the rice bowls though.  Nothing wowed us about that dish.    Lucky for me they are in my neighborhood, so I'll give them another visit soon.

Solid 4.5 stars.    I, like the review by Jeff F., stopped in for Food Truck Friday on 4-22-2011 and had almost the same thing he had:   the chicken and okra gumbo and the fried catfish SANDWICH special.    Both were definitely super-tasty.    The gumbo was a $5, decently large portion that was yummy, not overly salty, and full of large chunks of chicken and okra and sausage with a saucy white rice base.  I was amazed at the sheer number of chunks of meat or okra - it never ended, all the way to the last scrape of the paper-lined cardboard bowl.  The catfish in the sandwich was coated with your basic cornmeal batter, served on buttered Texas toast, with some kind of mayo sauce and lettuce and tomatoes.  It was large enough that I saved half of it for part of  my breakfast on Saturday.  I'd like to add that the catfish fillet was VERY THICK.  One of the thickest catfish cuts I have seen in this town.  One of the best uses of $10 I have seen in a while.  Worth the money, tasty as all get-out, and a signal that eating again off this truck is in my future.

I hereby join the loud chorus of Yelpers declaring this little place The Bomb.  Fish Tacos are indeed some of the best around.  All the meats were very tasty.  Can't wait to return and try a few more items on the menu !!

Not great.  Some mediums and some lows:  Ceviche - not that great.  Fish was kind of mealy and not seasoned well. Beef Tacos - the beef was VERY dry, some of it completely dry.  Seasoning was not noticeable. Carne Asada - decently seasoned, and not dry.  Nothing memorable though. Chips and Salsa Bar - the best part.  Several different kinds of salsa, including a tomatillo/avocado, a "spicy" red, and a "smokey" red. Tacos al Pastor - not that good. Rice and refried beans - standard fare, nothing to make them stand out.  I do like that they used Mexican crema for the sour cream.  All in all, qualifies as a "Never Again" stop.  P.S.  Had three co-workers with me, and none of them liked it either.

Nice little place, but not the best M.E. food in town.    My son and I both had the Filet Wrap and shared a side of Basmati.  The side was fairly large, definitely enough for two people.  The filet meat was well-seasoned, and tender, very yummy.  On the downside, I thought the amount of meat was a little skimpy.  My son ran out of meat and still had about 1/3 of his wrap left.  Bummer.  I'm going to go back and try some of the daily specials, which all look tasty and appear to be a better value than the $7.99 wrap that comes only with a wrap and a good sized tub of tzatziki sauce.  Definitely will return, considering there is nothing else like it in that area.  Good find.

Lemme lay a trufe on all y'all......  The "Arizona Smashchicken" (grilled version) is one of the best fast food chicken sandwiches you can find.  Anywhere.  Pair it with their tasty onion strings and a brewski, and you have yourself one DANDY tasting little dinner.  I've eaten a LOT of grilled chicken sammiches, and this one can stand with just about any of them.  Definitely a repeat customer.

Not great.  Barely good.  Tri-tip sandwich had "tough" tri-tip and it fell apart with the effort of trying to tear the meat during a bite.  Kids didn't like their burgers as well as they like In-N-Out.  The fries were decent, but the onion rings were crispy and the onion was overpowered by crust.  Doubtful we will return.  I had hopes for this place, as not many joints offer tri-tip, which is one of my favorite cuts of meat.  (sad face)

Being a Texan (it's a whole 'nother country) I am always on the lookout for places which do REAL Texas BBQ the right way.  This place is one of the few.  Funny Story:  the first time I brought some meat home from here, my son smelled the bag and said, "Smells like the Family Reunion up in here."  We always have brisket at our annual family reunion back in Texas, so when he smells brisket, he always thinks of that.....:)  I had made two trips here to get a variety of meats and sides, and they have ( for the most part ) all been big hits with me and the kiddos.  Lean brisket - can be a little dry-ish, but that's what you get when you lose the fat. Moist brisket - really moist, and excellent smoky flavor. Pork Loin - my son raved about it, called it the best pork he ever tried. Jalapeño Sausage link - nice flavor, but not hot enough for me. BBQ Chicken - nothing special - a weak point in the meats Chopped Beef - also known as chipped beef, and the sauce is a little overpowering and too salty. Red Beans - a little meat in there, and other flavors - VERY GOOD. Potato Salad - nothing memorable about it, but it was "good" Ribs - good flavor, but not tender enough for my tastes.  I like them falling off the bone. Banana Pudding - was GREAT one time, and was GROSS another time - WTH?  It will run about $12 per person to get a good "two servings each" batch of meats, so that is pretty reasonable for the quality of meat you get.  And lucky for me, they are only a couple of miles from home.  I have found my Go-To Texas BBQ place.

Had to try this new place after hearing/reading about it.  I first had the lentil soup, which comes with some tasty and crunchy pita chips.  Comparing it to the best in town, I'd give it a 7 out of 10.  Also tried the hummus, the jalapeno cilantro with grilled chicken.  The chicken pieces were a LITTLE overcooked. It was good, but again, comparing it to the best I've had in town, it's about a 7 out of 10.  Went with the Spicy Grilled chicken wrap, and it was loaded with fresh veggies and the chicken WAS actually kinda spicy.  VERY LARGE portion.  It was wrapped in foil and kinda hard to get to it without the abundance of ingredients falling out onto the plate, but it had a pop of great flavor.  The one problem was that the pinto beans and rice inside the wrap were slightly undercooked - still had a little bit of "crunch" to them.  I would not order this again.  Like this place, but they can get better.  And I think they will.  Four stars for now, and another review later if they improve.

Yum to The Yum for my Tum Tum Tum!!! (da-dum)  ( OK, that was corny. )  But the pizza here is anything but corny.  Had the "Hottie" and it was very tasty.  Best pizza I've ever had off a truck, by far. (wink wink)  Chewy, perfectly-done crust and all the ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful.  The one critique I would make is that the crust gets a little thin in the middle and "sogs up" a little before the end.  But that did not take away from the overall taste - this is a very good pizza under any grading system.   I will definitely hit this place again.  I was lucky to see them Tweet their location today and have it be just a few blocks from my workplace.

Dr. Kris and Maya and the whole team are awesome.  They work with you in regard to scheduling, insurance, etc - whatever you need, they accommodate.   Highest of High Regards for this operation !!    And to top it off, his dentistry skills and advice are also top notch !!!  If you aren't 100% pleased with your current dentist, make the move to Logos - you will be glad you did.

Solid transition from Awesome Truck to Easier-To-Find restaurant.  Had the Papa K, which is a buttery crêpe with arugula, ham, cheese, and chunky grilled mushrooms.  Totally delicious.   Daughter had the Smoked Turkey, which was more of a "wrapped crêpe" and was very good, but not on par with the Papa K, IMHO.  Anxiously awaiting the duck-fat fries to be offered......:)  Give these nice people and their super-duper crêpes a try - the taste will assure that you won't regret stopping by.

Good Fried Catfish fo' sho'.  Have had it several times, consistently perfect.  My son loves fried catfish and has asked for it from this place a couple of times.  I also had the Thanksgiving Dinner delivered to my house, and it was outstanding.  Their collard greens are very well executed, and their candied yams are top notch.  This cool little place will also allow you to order breakfast one day and have it delivered to your house the next morning - VERY cool service.  Owner/Manager is a very nice guy - I'd love to see this business succeed.  Go visit them.  I'm gonna order some breakfast this morning, in fact.
