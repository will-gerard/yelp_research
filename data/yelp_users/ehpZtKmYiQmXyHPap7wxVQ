This is such a great little neighborhood spot! I've been here several times since we moved to Mesa and service is always great. Food is great! I haven't had a dish that I didn't like and I've had a variety from their menu. If they forget something or make an error they most definitely make up for it before you leave. That's really all you can ask for!

Went to Marjerle's at Chandler Fashion last night for a birthday party and here's a list of things that went wrong:  1. Our reservation information was incorrect. We reserved a party of  25 people and they only put us down for 10. They also had the time wrong by an hour. Thankfully, they weren't busy. 2. We had to argue with the server more than once in order to add more tables onto ours even though they weren't busy and we were seated outside which was practically empty. 3. Our server had a bad attitude almost immediately and when we asked for a different server our request was ignored. We were given attitude whenever we asked questions about the menu items and she never once smiled.  4. We inquired about a Chambord vodka shot and we received Chambord liqueur shots instead. When we sent them back unconsumed there was attitude from both the server and the bartender as well.  5. Finally, when we decided to speak to Jeff, the manager, he was condescending and tried to discount our complaints with an argument for why his staff behaved the way that they did. He didn't listen to everything we had to say before he jumped in and started defending them. He then told us that the staff complained about us as well which is very unprofessional. Our request for a different server was finally honored and she was lovely, but it was much too late to salvage this establishment's reputation as far as I'm concerned.  6. Lastly, when I received my bill I had been charged for the shot that was returned and one person was charged $3 more for the same beverage that several others had been served throughout the evening. There was also 20% gratuity already added to all the checks.   This was my first and last visit to Majerle's.

This place is fantastic! We usually get take-out and they run just a few minutes behind on a busy Friday or Saturday night but it is well worth the wait. Drunken noodles are my favorite and if you get them Thai hot, be prepared to do some sniffling. They mean HOT!! Great service the couple of times I've eaten there for lunch. I only wish they had a beer menu for dine-in because it would go great with their already delicious menu!
