So Random!   Came here craving hawaiian shaved ice and found out this place sells water by the gallon, shaved ice, and THRIFTYS ICE CREAM!   We ordered shaved ice and the lady behind the counter overfilled our cups. I was SO excited to get my fruity shaved ice, but I was disappointed when i found out it was watery and bland. Not enough syrup :(   Tips: - Cost an extra 25 cents for more syrup - $5 minimum on your card  I'll be coming back for the thrifty's ice cream with is ALWAYS good :)  Environment: 2/5 Food: 2/5 (extra for the thriftys) Price: 4/5 Service: 5/5

Pure Awesomeness  Only came here a handful of times now, but I wish I was able to come here regularly.   Pros: - LOTS AND LOTS of cold delicious BEER. Ranging from ciders, lights, darks, 4%, 12%. You can sample any of them if you ask your server.        *** Tip: You can't order pitchers of beer that are higher than 8%. We ordered beer that was 12% and we were only allowed to have 3 pints/ person...which honestly was more than enough to get drunk off of while eating food. - MOUTHWATERING FOOD. Recommendations: Bruschetta and Santa Fe Burger with fries. So far everything I've eaten has been amazing, but those are the two things I continually crave! -SERVERS are extremely friendly and helpful. They always seem to strive to give you excellent service and your perfect choice of beer.   Cons: -Street Parking Only - can be a hassle if it gets pretty busy. 90 min street parking available right in front of restaurant.

3.75 STARS*  My family always seems to stop by this little restaurant every time we drive through Phoenix. This place used to be extremely busy but the last couple times it's been kind of slow :( On a positive note, the servers are more attentive and they seem to be paying attention to small details that were once overlooked.   The food here is consistently good, not California Chinese restaurant amazing but still pretty delicious. It reminds me of something my parents would make at home. Portion sizes vary from visit to visit, however it still within reason for their cheap prices.     Overall, I've had numerous good experiences with food and service at this restaurant and will continue to come here.

So pleasantly surprised!!   There really isn't anything bad to say about this place at all. The staff was beyond friendly and helpful. Being my first time here, they helped me thru their menu of coffee, drinks, smoothies, and sandwiches. I ordered a turkey, bacon, guacamole sandwich on focaccia bread. No lie, it looked a bit small and plain when it first came out. But it was delicious and surprisingly filling! I would definitely order it again.   Pros:  - friendly staff - open 24/7 - delicious  - pet friendly - gives treats and water to doggies :)

Affordable Boba with a pretty wide selection for an affordable price. They have everything from regular milk teas, fruit slushes, pudding, mango jelly, coffee jelly, etc. Everytime I've come there was been plenty of seating inside and parking in front of the shop. Service is always quick and friendly.   Not the best boba I've had in my life, but it is good enough to get my fix in Arizona.   Environment: 4/5 Food: 3/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 5/5

I came here with my parents for lunch one day. This restaurant didn't have any of our Americanized favorites (aka Pho lol) but it didn't matter we got some of our other favorites and tried a couple new noodle dishes.   I ordered Bun Bo Hue. It was okay. The broth lacked flavor and that nice red color that I am used to. The noodles looked like I got the end of the package or something, each noodle was less than 2 inches long! It made it so difficult to eat with chopsticks!! But on the plus side, they gave a good amount of meat   I tasted tasted the udon. The noodles were chewy and the soup was SO SALTY!!   I wish I looked at the other reviews before I came here, looks like rice is the way to go. But defiantly the noodles were a bit below par.    Environment: 4/5 Food: 2/5 Price: 3/5 Service: 4/5

Came here a couple times already in the past two weeks and I can say this is going to be my new Vietnamese Go-To Spot.   Portions are huge, price is cheap, food is spot on! Service could be better, I always find myself waving down servers for something, but its not bad enough where it keeps me from coming to this place.   Oh yeah! This place has all those Vietnamese Dessert/Drinks. So if you've been searching, look no more :)   Recommendations: -Pho -Lemongrass Vermicelli noodles -Bun Bo Hue  Environment: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 5/5 Service: 3.5/5

This is such a cute nice and clean park! There are three sections: xl dog, large dog, and small dogs. Everyone is really friendly. Lots of trashcans, doggie bags for those who forget, and watering fountains for humans and dogs. All the people were really friendly. The only downside is, I wish there were more benches inside the grass part so I could sit under the shade while my puppy played!   Tip:  Entrance is on flamingo rd! If you try entering on the other side, it's a school where no pets are allowed.

IM A FAN!  This buffet is inside the Talking Stick Resort and Casino. If you park in the West Parking structure and walk across the breeze way your will be pretty close to the buffet entrance.   I was a little hesitant to try this buffet because of their steep weekend prices (~$45/adult; thats like a Vegas Casino Buffet!) but we tried it on the weekday because its a little bit cheaper during the weekdays. Wednesday nights are prime rib night for ~$20. In all honesty, $20 for the variety and food that is offered is a great deal!  They have 7 different sections: Salad, Asian, Meat carving, Mexican, Raw seafood, Italian, and dessert. The Asian section was actually pretty yummy. It tasted A LOT better than your regular $7 Chinese buffets. It included fried rice, noodles, stir fry with muscles and clams, chicken wings, duck, egg rolls, cream puffs, and soups. It was mostly Chinese food, so I do wish there was more of a variety. The Meat carving station included prime rib and ham. Not too shabby. Mexican and Italian sections were both small but had the usual. Wednesday night also included shrimp cocktails and raw oysters! I was surprised. The dessert had a HUGE variety. from 10+ different amazingly delicious gelato flavors to pies, cakes, mousses, tarts, brownies, and cookies.   For $20 I will come back again; but I can't imagine what else they would serve for double the price!   Environment: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 4/5

EXTREMELY IMPRESSED !   Coming from the island not too long ago, I don't think I could find anything closer to the real thing. I wasn't expecting too much in a hot dry desert, but I was blown away.   It's kinda hard to find because its located inside another store "island sushi and grill". Walk straight to the back and you'll see the poke in a glass case like the fresh seafood section of a grocery store. The fish was fresh, tasty, and there's an assortment of flavors sold by the pound. My favorite was the Hawaiian.   Everything I tasted was amazing, my only wish was that I could buy a side of rice so I could mix it and eat everything!   Staff is friendly, seating is limited.  This is a must go!

Im loving it.   This place is located on the second floor of Harrahs. It is pretty small with about 3 tables, so don't expect to sit here to eat.   I ordered Watermelon with Pineapple. You choose your flavor, milk/cream, then add-ins.   Presentation (5/5): As everyone previously already mentioned. People usually come here just to see how it is made. The ice cream liquid is blended and placed on a freezing cold metal pan where it slowly freezes and they hand mix the ice cream till its a nice fluffy texture. Takes awhile but its fun to watch.   Food (5/5): I loved that this random combination worked. I loved that i watched them blend my watermelon from fresh fruit and that they didn't just throw pineapples in/ontop of my ice cream but they actually chopped up the pineapples and folded it into the final product. My only wish was that it was creamier and smoother.   Price(3.5/5): Its honestly kind of pricey for me. $8 for a small cup. I guess the extra goes to the workers having to work so hard to mix and make the ice cream but still, pretty pricey for a small (but decent sized) cup.  Service (5/5): Excellent and very helpful

Im surprised by Cosmopolitan's buffet. $38 for weekdays and $41 for weekends. I'm not quite sure what the difference is but it sounds like the menu changes day to day and probably weekends too. Buffet comes with a soft drink/juice/ice tea.   On a Wednesday night they served snow crab, steak, prime rib, lamb, chicken, sausage. It also included salad, antipasta, hummus, shrimp, shrimp ceviche, pasta, pizza, oxtail pho soup, sushi, fried rice, bone marrow, and the list goes on and on...Not too shabby for a "slow night". The food was pretty good. Most things were yummy, only a few things were outstanding.   Highlights: - Decor was very clean and beautiful - 90% of foods were NOT served in trays but small tiny individual portions. This was great so I could try a little bit of everything and NOT get all the different flavors mixed up. Also, the presentation of each mini plate was stunning.  - shrimp ceviche, yes. - barbacoa tacos, yum. - HUGE dessert selection!   Overall, this is such a GOOD deal for a Las Vegas buffet. Good food for a reasonable price! Service was nice, but so slow.   Environment: 5/5 Service: 2.5/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5

Unexpectedly yummy!!  I randomly stopped into this shop when I was walking down Mill Ave just to get something to satisfy my sweet tooth craving and boy was I glad I saw this place. They have an assortment of "Mexican popsicles"  which supposingly changes seasonally based on the ingredients that they can find. I got the pineapple raspberry popsicle. It was sweet, tart, juicy, and made of REAL FRUIT! I was really surprised by how delicious it was. ~$3/popsicle. Not too shabby for a real fruit treat :)   I'll definitely be stopping by to try some new flavors!

Your typical Cajun seafood in a bag restaurant.   This is Arizona's closest version of a restaurant that's pretty well known in other states (cough Boiling Crab). But I'm not going to complain because this joint is actually pretty good itself too.   You order your seafood by the pound based on market price. It comes in a bag with the flavor and spice level of your choice. Or you can get one of their fried baskets which I have yet to try. Only complaint I have is, I wish they gave more sauce in each bag; the saucier, the more flavor, the better. My server was ABOVE&BEYOND amazing. She was attentive, helpful, cheerful, and recommended the most amazing food to make our experience better.   Recommendations:  - sauce: trinity  - Cajun fries  - bread for soopin: dip the bread into the bag of sauce! So yummy!   Tips:  - if you go when the restaurant opens you may have the option of ordering one of their premade bags. It's from their leftover seafood from yesterday but it's a good deal and the seafood still tastes good! $20 bought us a 2lb bag of muscles, snow crab, shrimp, and veggies. If you want a little bit of everything, this is the way to go!   Atmosphere: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 5/5

Hot day walking along the strip? I'd recommend a sprinkles cupcake sundae! As all the reviews say, cupcakes are amazing; but it can get even better with a scoop of ice cream.   ~$7 you get a full sized cupcake with a scoop of ice cream in the middle. You can make any combination you want. For half the price you can get a mini cupcake and a scoop of ice cream.   The bottom half of my cupcake got kinda soggy as the ice cream melted, so I you don't plan on eating it extremely fast maybe get double tops or a mini cupcake.   But the mocha almond fudge ice cream is amazing!

Hidden Gem -- This place is where people need to start coming!  Besides the KPop Playlist, this place defiantly has a modern bar-like environment. From the light up decor (literally the tables and menus lit up) to the funny quotes on the walls and the hundreds of drooling hot celebrity pictures in the girls bathroom, this place has the makings of a great bar and night time hangout spot. There is a photoback drop spot set up, beer pong tables, and a dj/dance floor area being set up.  I went on a Thursday night and my table one of the few tables in the entire restaurant, but the workers said that its usually packed on the weekends. I'm guessing its because of their happy hour deal from 9-10pm: All you can drink wells drinks for some crazy low cost (I think she said $5 with a purchase but I forgot).   But what I can actually rave about is their food. Oh my goodness, I wasn't expecting how amazing the food was! We ordered baked muscles, Spicy Garlic Tuna Roll (x2), Miso Salmon, Hamachi Steak, and Yellowtail kama all for a total of $45. Everything we ate was AMAZING. Portions were very reasonable for the prices. My favorite was the Spicy Garlic Tuna Roll. So good that we actually ordered it TWICE during the same meal.   Recommendations: - Spicy Garlic Tuna Roll: $9 - Miso Salmon: $5 - Baked Muscles: $5 - Yelp Draft Beer: FREE with Yelp Check in - $12 for $20 Yelp Deal   Environment: 5/5 Food:5/5 Price: 5/5 Service: 4.5/5

YUMMY !  Thrifty's Ice Cream, Raspados, Mexican Candy, every sweet and delicious Mexican thing you can think of is in this tiny stop.   I got this fresas con creme. A M A Z I N G.  A little pricey ($8) but definitely big enough for 2+ people to share. What I loved most about it is, that its not too sweet where you can't eat more than a few scoops, there was a TON of fresh strawberries, and its topped with thrifty's ice cream! Seriously, was better than heaven.   Theres only a couple tables with chairs so expect to take these goodies to go.   Environment: 3/5 Food: 5/5 Price: 3.5/5 Service: 5/5

Coming from California where there is amazing and cheap AYCE KBBQ on every corner, I'd say this place is pretty comparable. They offer a pretty decent sized variety of meat and seafood for $19.99/person. It included everything from your typical short ribs, pork belly, rib eye, and brisket. It also included squid, octopus, green tea pork belly, spicy pork shoulder, beef tongue, and more!   The meat was tasty, portions weren't too huge but I appreciated that especially at the end when I was getting stuffed! Meals came with some yummy steamed egg and kimchi soup.   Service was very good! They were kind, friendly, attentive, and got the meats out in a timely manner. I will definitely be coming back here to get kbbq!  Environment: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Service: 5/5

HOME OF THE (almost famous) COOKIE CUP.   Instagram pictures don't do it justice. The cookie cup is a giant chewy macaron with two scoops of ice cream, toppings, and additional locally made toasted marshmellow. The ice cream is soft, creamy, and amazing. We were recommended to get their cereal ice creams (fruit loops, captain crunch, cinnamon toast crunch) I loved it, only thing I didn't like was the actual cereal bits because they got soggy, but the flavor was spot on! We ordered cinnamon toast crunch and green tea in a red velvet macaron with a toasted marshmellow for ~$6. Sharing is advisable because of size, but I'd completely understand if you don't want to.   Oh my goodness is this guilty sugar overload, but I would be more than happy to come back over and over and over.   The store is small and kind of hidden away in the shopping plaza behind Church's chicken. The owner was so sweet and helpful. The grand opening will be hosted, so keep you eyes out for the ads!  I highly recommend this place to everyone in the area & I only hope for the best for this shop :)
