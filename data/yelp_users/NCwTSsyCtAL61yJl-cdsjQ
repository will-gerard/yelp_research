Excellent food & atmosphere. Sat at the bar with a full menu and had a great experience, reasonable prices, and great service! Definitely recommend the Peppered Steak pasty.

I have been going here for three years! All of the guys are so friendly and they do an amazing job every single time. They can execute any idea that you have in mind. My nails always get compliments afterwards. Check out their Instagram to see all of their work! :)

The sandwich I got was okay but I had a bizarre experience. I had met up with my dad here for lunch. They called me within 10 minutes after leaving to let me know that my father left his phone at the deli, which was nice of them. I picked it up and I gave them my number so that my dad could reach me if he came to the deli to get his phone. My father was given a completely wrong number and they wouldn't let him use their phone to call me. He eventually meet up with me at my house and that's when we pulled it out of the case and noticed it had a completely broken screen and would not turn on.. Not a happy customer.

Loved the drinks but the service was horrible. We ordered an appetizer that never came (and was later put on the bill). I would rather just sit at the bar than deal with the server's attitude.
