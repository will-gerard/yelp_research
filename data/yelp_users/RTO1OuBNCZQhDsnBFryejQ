I wouldn't recommend it.  The place use to be very good and a favorite.  It was just an awful experience.  The food was below average.  We found hair in the food.  My water was empty for a long time.  They sat us outside.... It was freezing.... Trust me.  Save your time and money.

I can't remember ever writing a bad review but this place is horrible.  The service is horrendous.  We were extremely polite but the server was rude.  We asked if we could get a plain omelette and he said if it's not on the menu you aren't going to get it.  Who says that?  Every time he came back he had another rude comment.  It's not my fault you are a waiter at 45.... sorry bro...go to school like the rest of us.

Bad owner..... They were seating us in the lounge and then the owner came up and said I'm not seating in the lounge tonight.  Pass on this place... only 10 tables anyway.

Just spoke to David and I have to say he was very rude and unprofessional.  I'm not use to being treated by a company in this way.  I'm typically leaving 5 star reviews so I regretfully have to say avoid this place at all cost.  Hope this helps other Yelp users.

You are seriously finally responding from a complaint in 2014.  Again, your customer service is horrible.  Good luck with your business.  Of course, you don't remember any of the details as this occurred in 2014.

I really wish there was less than 1 star in ranking a company.  They messed up our flooring and then have the nerve to not want to give us a refund.  Justin and Jagger you must not have much management training.  They can't possibly teach you to behave in such an unprofessional manner and tell you to say that you can't get a refund for a steak dinner after you eat it.  Poor, Poor, Poor! I'm saving other customers from such a horrible experience.  Over $360 to clean tile and they couldn't clean it.  Had another company do a perfect job for $300.  Stay away!  Still fighting with them over a refund.  Your reputation isn't worth $360?

Hello Everyone,  I wanted to write a follow up review as I contacted the Better Business Bureau and they filed a complaint and they couldn't even get a response from this company.  I would recommend you avoid a company that doesn't care about their reputation or making the issue right.  I also contacted the corporate office with no response.  Not a company I would recommend.

This is a great place to go....before going to The Joint I lived off of Excedrin and Ibuprofen.  I love the fact that you get in an out without an appointment.  The Dr. does a great job!

This is a tough restaurant to rate.  The reason being is the service is good but the food is definitely not good.  Especially, for a Fox Restaurant.  Save yourself from the disappointment.  I tried all 4 dishes on the table and my Girlfriend couldn't even eat her Kale salad.  Pass on this overrated restaurant.  If it wasn't across from US Airways Arena it would not stay in business.

It's been a little while since I've eaten hear but the food is excellent.  It gets a little noisy if they seat you by the bar area so I recommend getting seating away from the bar.  Overall, service is good and the food is great!

Dr.Sorr is an excellent doctor! I enjoy the time he spends explaining technical medical information in a way anyone can understand it!
