I live close, so instead of Burger King, I went to Subway sounded less greasy. I not only saw at least 3 homeless people who smelled like pee, but the guy who was making my "sub" had hickeys all over his neck. I get it, sometimes it happens but the hickeys where fresh...all I could think of the whole time he was making my sandwich is he had his hands up some girls coochie less then 24 hours ago, he seemed like a nice enough employee but I paid for my food and walked out, and dropped it in the trash, just like the girl that he did last night.

My poor little Harley, has to get a few shots and had some bladder issues, the vet was so nice to my cat, and keep on mind Harley dislikes everyone but me, sadly for me he bit the vet and the groomer when I was there, but they took good care of him and I  glad he is feeling much better

I called and made sure that I have an appointment, as well as my medical records needed to be requested, I come in find out that my medical records from previous doctor where not requested, I sat in the clinic for 2 hours saw the doctor for 10 min, she didn't listen to anything I was saying and flat out told me that because I am 21 I don't have ADHD and I have anxiety instead wtf? I also needed a new birth control shot that was never addressed...even when I mentioned I needed birth control several times, when I mentioned it again they told me they already had my discharge paper so I guess I am just gonna get prego! Ugh

I love this place, I get my nails done here all the time, they always look good, and stay on for a really long time, but the issue that I have is they are not very careful with your nail beds, I always end up with hang nails and bleeding, I wish they where a little more gentle :(

Lets start with the food, I get it fast food, but seriously 2 stars are for the food. Service was horrible, I can my card through the card reader next to me, and five minutes later a chubby 16 year old comes with my food, telling me I didn't pay... I told her yes I have, I just paid about 5 minutes ago, she looked at me like a deer in head lights...telling me over and over again I didn't...after she went back inside and checked that I in fact did pay she came back pretty much chucked my food into my window and walked off...seriously that's rude. Customer service is horrible.

I am so upset right now, I used to love living here, that is till they tried to tow my car while I was parked on the white line, I was not double parked but my tires slightly hit the white line, I was not given a warring no sticker on my car nothing, so after I moved my car I went in the office and spoke them I was assured that this situation would be handled the next day, and that was fine with me...Thursday comes around I get a call from Ashley, I tried to explain the situation to her as it made me upset and now scared that I am going to come out and find my car gone, she advised me that I can always break my lease for a mere 635 dollars if I don't like it here, not only did it not resolve my situation but it made me upset enough to have my attorney handle it, I was treated so unprofessionally, that I am appalled because when I first moved in here the staff was so nice and helpful, I guess when actual management situation need to be handled they crumble under pressure, just waiting for July to move out! I would not recommend living here.

I was so excited to try something new! I went inside and the place was really cool. When I got back to work to eat my chicken, it was raw, my chicken was bleeding. I am not sure if it's a mistake or what is going on. The portions are small for what you pay for and I like my chicken cooked. I will never go back I don't even want my money back.
