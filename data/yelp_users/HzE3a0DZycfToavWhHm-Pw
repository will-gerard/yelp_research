Rito's gots the Best Burritos, hands down!!   I ordered the green on green burrito. It was soooo gooood!!! I feel like a stuffed burrito now. But these burritos are as good as they look, and the taste is like your over at Nana's house for some homemade real Mexican food!! This will be the spot I run to when I'm feeling a saucy, cheesy, flavorful burrito.   The only thing I gotta say is, since the only spot to sit was outside on their patio with no shade, we kept dodging the neighborhood bee who kept stopping by at our table since we had open can sodas. Maybe next time we'll be smart like the other table sitting next to us and bring our own sodas, lids and all.

Not impressed with the service or the pizza.    I was craving some wings and pizza and we were in the neighborhood. We have been here before because we loveee the wings and I thought we loved the pizza.  So we order a small pizza, wings and an appetizer, which was fried zucchini.  We let our waitress know, Aubrey was her name, that we wanted the appetizer first. 15 minutes roll around and no appetizer! Plus my husband was out of water and she hadn't come around. Finally a different waitress comes out with our order, minus the appetizer.  I mention to her we haven't received it and our waitress shows up just in time to hear this and basically scolds the other waitress helping out, like it was her fault that we didn't get our appetizer.  So we ask for a refill as she leaves, no problem, or at least we thought, 5 minutes into eating their suicide wings (which are by far the hottest hot wings I have ever tasted) my husband is really in need of that water. Finally I see her come around but with no water, she almost makes it to the table when I see that she realizes the same thing and she does a complete 180, and a few minutes later...daa daa!!! Water!!!  Other than the service completely lacking, and the pizza pretty blah, I enjoyed the wings and zucchini.  Unfortunately it did kinda ruin that satisfaction I was going for since after all I was really craving something more than what I got.

Horrible horrible company!!! If you're on a budget don't come here, they'll RIP you off!!   We rented a car 10/4/14 through 10/6/14 for my sister in law. She was added and we added the additional budget insurance. She brought the car back dirty. But not dirty enough to rack up 250$ of detailing fees! They took photos and sent them via email. Talking about stains. Believe me, there was no stains! There was some crumbs on the seat and some dirt on the floors but nothing a vacuum couldn't handle. Now, I don't know what the intentions were of the employees that service the vehicles, but I'm suspecting they get a bonus for every car they detail, or somebody wants a raise! You know it don't cost 250$ to detail a car!   I've been trying to handle this manner but talk about BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, I have yet spoken to a supervisor about theses excessive fees! I've called the Budget 800#  and I've spoken to countless representatives, why, because they can't get it right the first time and the supervisor can only call you or email you back within 24-48 hours!  This company is a joke. If you run into trouble with these guys, it's a pure run around! I will be looking into exposing this company for what they are, greedy uncaring scheming business operators! I really want to call them something else right now!

The best place to get chicken spring mix salad!!! Well that's what I always get, and it comes with soft delicious pita bread and their house dressing which is so good!  When I'm in the mood for a great salad, I always come here, and always leave satisfied.  You'll love their burgers and fries as well, its my husband that switches things up, but for me, I'm going to stay a Crazy Jims salad fan4life!! Why fix what's not broke?

Love this place but recently I've noticed it's not been consistent. Did they hire a new cook to take over lunch hour?! My usual salad wasn't as fresh tasting. The tomatoes and cucumbers looked like they had been refrigerated too long! Also the new wait staff...tsk tsk, he was unpleasant and un attentive. I was hoping the experience would get better but he hardly came by. Then the check arrived, we paid, he came back with the change and didn't say a word except here you go. Rude! If I'm feeling like my favorite salad, I'm going to try out the new location downtown. This place is great but like I said it's been really inconsistent.

This place has gone down hill. Time to look for a new pediatric dentist. Although I like Dr. Heimann, the staff is not the friendliest. Also the waiting room is turning into a mess. This last time I visited, only 2 of the 4 kid arcade games were working.  I've been taking my kids here for about 5 years now, we've moved further away from this office since. It's not worth the drive to me anymore.

First impression when I walk into the place is the smell of dirty carpets. Gross! We get seated right away. Usually it takes forever since everyone in the area seems to like Olive Garden?!  So it took 10 minutes to get our drinks, then almost another 50 minutes to get our entr√©es. The food in my opinion is so commercial. I really don't get why people come here so often. I guess everyone is so used to their McDonalds and microwave dinners.   I ordered the cheese ravioli with tomato sauce. I literally could taste the package it came out of! There is nothing fresh about Olive Garden, not even the salad, which is soaked in house dressing and stale croutons. Other than the food which was lacking, so was the service. Our waitress took forever to refill drinks and notice the obvious things which we needed.  The only reason why I came here, was because it was my niece's bday dinner and she wanted to try it. I really don't miss this place nor will I ever crave anything here.

Needed a breakfast burrito fix and seen the great reviews about them here at Ramiro's (thanks to Yelp)  So I decided to place an order to go, since I don't have the luxury of going inside to eat anymore, since I have a little one that would rather bounce around a restaurant then sit down like a civilized human being.  Anywho, the place was a little hard to find, but I managed (thanks to Yelp) for having a built in gps system. It's a small hole in the wall tucked in between other businesses in a outdated strip mall. I didn't mind, just wish they had a drive up window for people like me.  No biggie, I was in and out in a minute. So now to the food... I ordered the egg, bacon, cheese burrito with add in potato. I wanted to try the one with sausage so I ordered that one too. The bacon was the winner. These burritos are big enough to split and you'll still feel satisfied. I liked the green homemade salsa with mine. The red salsa was too much on the herby side to mesh well with the eggs and potatoes. Overall I really enjoyed my experience and I would go back when I need another breakfast burrito fix.

Bad location to get your drugs from. Never pleased with their pharmacy drive thru. Long lines and longer waiting. The pharmacist helping us at the time, was probably the cause for the long waiting period. She kept telling us to hold on then she'd come back after several minutes and ask how she could help again?!?!?  After finally purchasing our order, she forgot to give us back our credit card. We then had to convince her that we didn't receive it and that it had to be somewhere in her reach.   After she found it in her possession, she still found it hard to believe that she could forgot nonetheless misplace our card, but we didn't find it hard to believe.  We will not be getting our pharmaceuticals from here again.  We'll find another Walgreens location next time around.

So I haven't been to this mall in ages! But now that I've had a small taste of this huge indulgent mall, I'd have to say it's like taking that first bite into that massive mouthwatering burger, there's so much more to it! This isn't a regular mall, it's a cool mall! In regular malls you smell brand new sparkly stuff. But this mall, I smelled gold, diamonds, genuine leather, and lots of money! The ambiance was like Charlie chocolates factory! So much to see and so much to buy! If only my pockets were as full as the guy standing next to me in this mall. Is it me or does everyone shopping here seem filthy rich? Well maybe not everyone but you get what I'm saying.   The cons about this mall is the fact I was pushing a stroller, the design is a maze in some sort if you are pushing anything with wheels. The ramps weave from side to side and the elevators can be tricky. Make sure you read the directions. I sensed the frustration on another couple who were with child in tow and trying to figure out the elevators and what button to push, again...read the directions.   Overall I have to say I love this mall. We parked outside Nordstroms in the garage. Seriously when we stepped outside of Nordstroms, it was like we were leaving the airport! It looks like a mini terminal. I hope you get the picture if you haven't been and if you have, maybe you can agree this mall is pretty epic!

Favorite BBQ place to go!   I had the lunch platter, which was St. Louis ribs, BBQ chicken, and beef brisket. Oh my lord, was it so heavenly good. As good as it looked. The brisket was my favorite, so tender and flavorful. All the meat just falls off the bone, so soft and dee-licious! Can't forget to mention their mac n' cheese, so creamy and cheesy, best mac n'cheese in the world! I might be reaching, but I promise you it was oh so good! Also we loved the cornbread. Cute little patties is how they come out, and we can't tell you how those little donuts they serve after each meal, how tasty those little things are, a little sweet and crunchy on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside. We loved this place so much, we came back the next day for dinner, seriously! I'm pretty sure you'll love it too.

The cheesecake baklava was to die for! I thought I died and went to heaven when I took my first bite of that creamy crispy goodness! It is sooo good I will have my man drive far and wide to get us another slice!  The Greek salad was good too.

I love costco! Far better than SAMs club! This place is always packed though, which is always a good sign for the most part. I love the food court, we bought 3 hotdogs which comes with 3 drinks, a whole pizza and a yogurt, all under 20$!! What a steal!! We were hungry that day lol! But the food is good!

I am still pissed that I even spent money here, totally NOT WORTH IT!!! My nails are so damaged thanks to one of the ladies that over used the drill tool, even burning me in the process. The gel manicure I got didn't even last long before it was chipping.   Besides their quality of work, which there is NONE, the way they treat you or the way I got treated was "let's get her in and out!" I came back twice! Not because I wanted to, but because I had too!!!  I wanted them to fix the gel nails that were peeling within one day!!!   Of course they give me the lady who burned me and did the gel mani in the first place, WHY??? I don't know but she was trying to put the blame on me for her crappy nail job, telling me to wear gloves when I clean. I hadn't even begun to clean since it had only been one day since getting the bad nail job plus, I was busy with graduations and that's why I wanted my nails to look right. But there is no point in trying to explain yourself here because there is such a STRONG LANGUAGE BARRIER!!  It was hard communicating with anyone because of it!! How she even communicated for me to wear gloves while cleaning was by actually grabbing a glove and showing me!! Ha!! Very insulting to be made to feel that she thinks her nail job was up to par and that somehow I caused the chipping and peeling. She was just very rude.   After the fixing of the previous bad nail job, she went over all the nails with another coat of gel polish causing them to look warped  and uneven. Yuck!! Making this nail job THE ULTIMATE WORST GEL MANICURE IN MY LIFE!!!   I will not ever go back and I suggest to you reading this, to not even consider spending and wasting your time here!!   *just to throw it in there, I didn't receive any arm and hand massage either!

I come here because it's close, convenient and although there's 5 more nail salons around in the neighborhood, I like this one so far.  The owner is very friendly and is always full of compliments. I've been seen by a few nail techs, and so far I have enjoyed my services.  Today I wanted to switch my colors up on my gel manicure. Lisa who attended me was very nice, but I realized she started to speed up the process after several women came in. Note: the nail art is a tad on the sloppy side. This was my first experience with this particular nail tech.  But overall, I have come back to VS Nails because their gel mani's last longer than those from other nail salons.

I really enjoyed this place. I ordered the combo platter which consisted of roasted beef, lamb and chicken skewers, on a bed of rice. The lamb was my favorite. I recommend the lemonade! You can really pick up on the orange water that it's made with. For dessert we tried the baklava which was superb! Next time We will try it with their Turkish coffee. The nice owner or manager tried to get us some before we left but we were in a hurry. We will be back that's for sure.

Not impressed. I'm giving 1 star for cleanliness of restaurant and 1 star for fast and friendly service. But for the food, all I can say is Overpriced for the Quality!   My daughter ordered a few sushi rolls, and those were not very fresh tasting. Even your basic California roll tasted as if we found it at your local grocery store. Very basic.  I ordered the teriyaki salmon, and that came with a small bowl of rice, your choice of white or brown, a side salad and a bowl of luke warm broth (soup).  Absolutely none of that got my tastebuds excited!  We had a few appetizers as well. We ordered the mixed Tempura, and some kind of Japanese quesadilla. They were very minimal and basic, if ordering appetizers for a big party, I'd go with ordering 2 or more of the same thing, because the quesadilla appetizer came with 5 small pieces and the mixed Tempura came with a Handful of mixed veggies and one shrimp.   Overall, it was not worth the price for the value of what we got and we will not be coming back.

Who wants a watered down drink???  Unfortunately this Starbucks is very inconsistent with their drinks and their customer service.  Sometimes I get a good drink with a friendly barista but most times I'm served a unhappy drink from an unhappy barista. I'm writing this review today because I have had it, I ordered my favorite seasonal drink which is a venti oprah chai tea, nonfat milk with 3 pumps of gingerbread, but what I got was a venti iced cup of watered down milk!! Now who wants to pay 5$ and some change for that?! I don't, and you better insure the baristas know how to make a stiff one served with a happy smile for that kind of money.

This place is so popular in all the hoods Ive been to. They're doing something right. The food is great, tried something new tonight called the paquimestitos or something like that. But they really got a little bit of this and that from pastry breads to the jugos to the Tortas to the nachos. You gotta try this place.

They must be doing something right to get that kind of celebrity to come to eat here! I definitely recommend!

I thought it was just me, but from the looks of the reviews it's not.  The staff here is rude for the most part. I cannot speak for everyone, but every time I come here, I don't get any assistance and when I try, it seems like I'm interrupting their gossip session or a text message ( I say text message because this girl was reading her text while she was at her station) and seemed annoyed when I had a question and was very unhelpful.   And today I come in to return a product and I'm the only one at the front cashier station waiting for these two ulta representatives to stop talking to each other about something!?!?  I felt like I was the one being rude for breaking up their little sewing circle. They finally look at me and ask if I needed something. I say is this were I can return something, and the girl says this is the only place you can return something in a snotty tone while the other girl snickers and walk away.   Besides the rude employees, the place is kinda dirty and messy, the isles are very narrow and I prefer MAC and Sephora to this place. I only come here because it's closest to my home.

Phenomenal! The flavors of Louisiana fits their name. I've never been to Louisiana, but I can imagine what it's like by eating this food. Louisiana's got soul and flavor!   First timer here and got our food To Go, so far I'm impressed with the whole experience. My to go order was placed conveniently and easily, the food was ready within 15 minutes and on my table and devoured in no time flat. I ordered the hush puppies along with the fried tomatoes. Those did not disappoint, recommend those puppies any day. Crispy on the outside soft on the inside. I also recommend putting malt vinegar after you take that first bite...can you say...Mmmmm?? It just soaks up all the yummy goodness and pairs nicely.  Also we order the chicken Po boy along with a Catfish entree. Both were satisfying and Comforting.   I recommend trying this place out. Since I didn't visit the inside of the establishment, I'm not sure what condiments they have for the public. I do recommend Crystal Louisiana Hot Sauce to go with this type of food, it's the Original Louisiana hot sauce and tastes far better than their competitors.

The best horchata and salsa bar ever!! When you come here, you have to try the horchata, unique and oh so tasty. Also, I'm a salsa lover, I love to make it, I love to indulge in it, salsa is my middle name.  So when I come here, its always the best part of the meal. My favorite is the pecan salsa, so creamy and not what you would expect a pecan salsa to taste like.  The burritos are delicious as well and I've had the tacos too, everything is so eye appealing as well as tasty! I wish the restaurant was a bit roomier, but it stays consistent in the number of people coming in and doesn't get overcrowded. I wouldn't recommend to big parties. But overall I love this place and recommend you try it out.

This is the most pleasant Starbucks I have ever been to. There is always a polite person on the other end of the speaker when ordering and and even funnier and pleasant person when paying. I think they hire only these type of people which makes it a even more joyful experience while picking up your favorite starbuck beverage.

Best place for breakfast burritos! Try the egg, potato, bacon and cheese burrito. Tastes like my Tia made it, if I had a Tia! But you get the point, their food is fresh and homemade, just like their salsas.   I ordered to go and in no time my order was ready! Walking into this establishment sets off a vibe of authenticity. The ladies in the kitchen were friendly and I felt like I was walking into my best friends families home. It's a nice cozy restaurant nestled in old town Tolleson.   Aside from the breakfast burritos, the other food I ordered was delicious too! The chiliquiles, the beans and rice, all was superb! Can't wait to comeback again!

Ok, I was like everyone else, read all the great reviews and was sure I'd have a great experience, yet that was far from the truth.  Our first experience was a cut and style with Nikki. I say our, because it was my teenage daughter getting the cut and style. We usually go to Tony and Guys located at Arrowhead, but this salon was closer and we had a gift card to use. So I was anticipating a great job, based on the reviews! What my daughter got was too much chopped from her crown which made her face look rounder and she looked older. She wanted something more edgier, more hip. She did not get that here, even though she kept telling Nikki it wasn't quite right. I think this salon is used to doing "certain" type cuts and styles, not the stuff Tony and Guy can achieve. So she left sad and embarrassed, anyone that has had a bad cut and didn't get what they were hoping for can understand the feeling.   So...lastly we are left with the nail review. I still had money to use on my gift card, so I decided to do something nice for myself. I made an appointment with Misty, the ONLY nail technician at Salon de Chevoux. I wanted gel nails and sadly there were only a few colors to choose from. I wasn't impressed with her station, it was pretty dirty looking and I almost thought she was going to use a dirty file from the "dirty tool" container, but she put it back and grabbed a clean file. Whew! So, we chat, she seems nice, but I was looking around for a pedicure chair since she also does pedicures, and could not locate one! I asked where the chair was (that most nail salons have) but they did not have one!!!  I guess all she does, is whip out her portable foot jacuzzi, as you sit in a regular chair. Wow, glad I didn't make an pedicure appointment. The downside of having one technician is, you can't get your nails done with a friend or daughter! Since you'd have to take turns, turning a 30 minute appointment into an hour or more!!  Soooo, she finishes my gel nails, I go to pay using my Gift card, but the cashier lady doesn't include Misty's tip. So I have no cash on me and I feel bad to not leave her anything, so they try to figure out how to add a tip. I'm in a hurry to go, had a son to pick up from school, so I decided I'd just buy something from the Dermalogica line. Of course it's overpriced but at this point I don't care, I just want to leave. So I used up the 70$ on my gift card just so I could leave and not ever come back!! I have to say, although the girls seem pretty nice, I am not impressed with any of their services!   FWI: my gel nails started peeling off 2 days later!! I'm not picking at them either, they did it all by themselves! I finally got them redone somewhere else and let me tell you, it was a whole different experience! 2weeks later their still holding up strong and the only problem is, is that their growing out and I need to get them done again!

My burger melted in my mouth! I ordered the "el diablo", and we all shared zucchini fries, sweet potato fries, as well as onion rings. So very tasty. I had a glass of chardonnay, and although everything was cooked to perfection, this place would have gotten five stars if it weren't too expensive for everything ordered. Not to mention the hostess forgot to give us kids menus and were not brought to us till it was time to go.  We basically just had to ask if they served kid burgers, no big deal.  But we will be back next time we are craving melt in your mouth burgers.  Oh, and happy hour looks like a great time to fill up on wine and food for the best prices.

Who is the manager that runs this location? They're always out of certain donuts and  their customer service is the worst.  On occasion I like to pick up some munchkins. But every time I stop, they never have enough munchkins or they don't have certain ones. Usually they have all the ones I don't like.  It's not just about the lack of donuts it's the way the employes treat you as well, my business is not feeling appreciated here.

Their flavors are delicious and far from being artificial like the American snow cones. I recommend the chocolate, pistachio and vanilla, all with cream. So far those are the ones I enjoyed the most. I still got to go back and try others!

Yummy tabouli salad, delicious chicken, great Greek fries, pitas are poppin, I can't say enough about how great the food is. The guy in front is always so pleasant and I keep coming back for those addicting chicken kabobs! My husband and I are seriously hooked. The location is always packed since you got the chipotle & smash burger next door, but I'm so glad they got this little Greek joint in the mix, it's my favorite.

Amazing!! I'm so impressed with the quality of detail they managed to pull off on the interior of my kid tested family car! I haven't seen my car this clean since we bought it and believe me, I've taken it to other car detailers and I have yet to be as impressed with the results like these.   My little boy spilled a smoothie in my car and it had settled into the carpet. Anyone that has kids that have spilled drinks might know the smell that accumulates after mixing drinks with dirty carpet. Yuck!!! But you would never know after getting my car back today! The smell is impeccable! Smells like a new car again! Everything is spotless as well! They cleaned between every crevice. My leather seats are shining again! I love when people pay attention to such detail.   My hubby has brought his vehicles here in the past and was impressed with the quality so he decided to take my car in,(which was by the way) in need of some heavy duty cleaning! My car got a total makeover today thanks to Frances and Sons and my sweet hubby for bringing it in for me! We will continue to bring our vehicles here! You guys made my day!

A lot better than In and Out burgers if you ask me. Gets a little expensive when your ordering for the whole family and adding drinks and fries to that, but totally worth it. Fresh lettuce and tomatoes, quality ingredients is what you're paying for. Plus I love all the different options when choosing your fountain drink.

Yum! My new breakfast spot to go to. I give this place 4 stars not 5 because although the food was delish, the service was slacking and the music was on the extremely loud side which could be good if you have loud kids or are in a tired mood and need to be jolted out of your sleepiness.  They were closing at 2:30 so that could be the reason we had gotten the slacking service. Everyone seemed to be more focused on doing their side work and getting ready to leave.   I suggest ordering the pancake flight. It comes with 3 pancakes of your choice. I enjoyed the sweet potato and blueberry Danish. There's nothing else like these pancakes. Really flavorful and unique. You can get them gluten free as well.

This is our go to place. I haven't found another barber shop that can cut my sons hair the way I like. Sometimes we get certain ppl and they don't do as good as job as the owner or others, but all in all, they do a spectacular Job compared to most barbers we've been to. The owner is really nice too, makes you feel welcomed.

To make it short and sweet, I was not impressed. Cost me an arm and a leg to get some ramen. I wouldn't be complaining if it was worth it, but it was too bland for my tastes. I had to keep adding soy sauce, chili paste, & Siracha to make it taste like something. Won't be coming back. The restaurant has a nice feel to it though.

We were in the neighborhood and couldn't decide where to eat.  So we gave Cristina's a try.  I'm glad we did because the food was obviously made with love.  It wasn't whipped up and slopped down onto your plate, or dumped out of a bag into a microwave.  This food was homemade from real Salvadorian women.  No impersonations here.  You will find real authentic food.  I ordered the beef stew meat with rice and potatoes and my mom had the same. My sister got the shredded beef chimichanga with sauce on top.  I also ordered some pupusas.  It was all so yummy.

CLAMATO PREPARADO!! A taste of one of these bad boys will have you speechless. Seriously, I think all I did was make a noise!!! So refreshing yet different than your ordinary refreshing drinks. I want to know how the hell was this drink even conspired. Did someone just throw a couple of things together that they had laying around the kitchen and come up with this extravagant yet simple masterpiece? If you don't know what a Clamato preparado is, let me tell you my version, it's Clamato juice with all the fixings: a celery stick, peppered beef jerky, some kind of sticky sweet spicy candy straw, one tasty shrimp, rimmed with sweet yet spicy seasoning, and topped off with a salted prune. This drink reminds me of a Bloody Mary...without the alcohol. In fact if you wanna get one of these, take it home and provide ur own vodka, this would equal to be a pretty fine happy hour. If you like bloody Mary's, I recommend you trying one of these fine beverages.   Aside from the orgasm I had in my mouth, the place is clean, the people are friendly and the service was fast. I look forward to coming back and getting another one of these! Oh and I enjoyed the fruit cup too!

Best pizza ever!!! Mmmm!   When you get your pizza you can smell the flavors marinating! It's so heavenly!! I love their thin crust and their pan pizza. The thin crust is crispy and let's the toppings do most of the talking. Then you have the pan, which is thicker but soft and non greasy.   I love the pan crust with pepperoni and jalape√±os! It's so cheesy and the jalape√±os are so spicy it's a yummy combination. Then my other favorite is the thin crust which is called the original crust with pepperoni, sausage, olives and onions. This pizza smells like pizza but with a deep Merlot smell to it, it's so yummy! The sauce is splendid! Not only is it a tomato sauce but it has chunks of tomatoes in it. This is quality pizza overall, it tastes authentic and you'll be craving more!

I'm finally writing a well deserved review. I've been here many times before and each time I've been completely satisfied with my experience. I've tried the salads, chia parfaits, wraps and fresh lemonades. I really enjoyed each one. So far my favorite salad is the Asian salad. The Cobb salad is also a favorite in my household.   The service is very fast and the food is always fresh. They have many options to choose from when ordering. The only thing I wish was different was the location. I really want one to be in my backyard, I would probably go everyday if that was the case.   I'm really happy that they've came up with a fast food chain that serves up fresh healthy meals instead of your typical greasy GMO hormone injected processed crap! I heart salads!!!
