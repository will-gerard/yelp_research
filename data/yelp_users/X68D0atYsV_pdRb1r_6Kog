I would recommend this to anyone in the chandler area. They change their gelato flavors often and customer service is spot on. Next time I will try their shakes.

This is toward the service department. I had an appointment for 8 am on a Saturday and I did not know who my service adviser was. I was standing in the lobby room waiting for someone to approach me. Finally after 15 minutes, a serve adviser named Kristi came and talked to me after the service manager approached me asking if I needed help. I said no, I have not been helped yet.   First, I needed an inner boot replaced because it was torn.  The service tech did replace them BUT the service tech claims my AC was leaking. The service tech talked to Kristi Moore and talked about figures on how much it was cost to replace it.  They were quoting about 1300 bucks. I said oh really?  When I turned the AC, it is blowing cold. I told them have you even turned the AC on yet? The service tech said not yet. I told him you are telling the AC is out and it is really not.  He made a side comment and laughed.  Also after I came home, there was a funny noise when I make a right turn on the passenger side.  When I got home and ramped up my car, I found the service tech did not screw in a bolt where the wheel and axle meets to replace the inner boot.  That was a total failure and I could have gotten in an accident.  Second, I took my car to get an oil change and I always double check their work.  Unfortunately, the service tech guy likes to over torque the oil filter and transmission plugs.  I should of written down the name who serviced my car or if it is the training issue at Chandler of Subaru in general.  Finally in my opinion, the service tech and Subaru of chandler are out to get your money and I am not going back there anymore. I found so many defects in their work and they are untruthful.

This is my overall experience of this place with my wife for the past year.  Watch out for some red flags on this practice such as Dr. Devendra Wadwekar saying what he has to say and not letting the patient ask any questions.  It feels like he wants you in and out within 5 minutes of the appointment.    Another one is the pharmacy being confused on what is the correct prescription.  Dr. Devendra Wadwekar does not communicate with the pharmacy well.  After a year of treatment has gone by, we decided to ask for a second opinion with another doctor. We still had pending lab results and we have not officially signed off to another doctor by legal paper yet. On August 21, 2014 we have not heard from them for a week and a half. They did not make any attempt to call us back on the results on my wife's lab work. They claimed "we did not receive the lab results" when we called them.  We decided to call our second opinion doctor to see if Dr. Devedra Wadwekar faxed my wife's doctor medical records yet. They have said no.  So we went down to the East Valley Diabetes & Endocrinology P.L.C.  facility to find out what is going on and we have asked for physical medical records since we do not want to deal with them anymore. They have claimed we cannot just ask for it when we called them 30 minutes ago and it would take 7 business days.  Also, they tried to hard sale us claiming we can put the medical records on a CD for a fee and mail it to you. We said no and told them fax it to the second opinion doctor.  I have a feeling they are going to be shady again and not fax it. Finally, we have arrived at the facility, we asked what is the results from my wife's blood work. They finally bust out the lab paperwork and I thought to myself they claimed they do not have one on the phone. They just threw the paper at me and said, "here." I look at the nurse and asked, "what does this mean?" This was all going by legal document that Dr. Devendra Wadwekar is suppose to know the details of my wife's blood work and medical situation.   The East Valley Diabetes & Endocrinology P.L.C. is just out to get your money and patient's care is not number one for them.  If you plan to try them out, watch out for the signs. I would not recommend this facility to anyone who has diabetes or a thyroid issue. This is definitely a shady healthcare business.

When I approached the restaurant, it appears sketchy. The place is small and dirty. It is a type of restaurant to order food and get out. The service is pretty bad. The only positive side was the braised pork. In my opinion, everything is over pickled and has too much vinegar. It was to a point my mouth was numb. Finally, the worst part is ordering fish fillet with black bean sauce. The result was fish fillet with tofu with pickled sweet and sour sauce. The owner pulled a fast one and talked to the cooks and tried to convince us it has black beans in it. I am pretty sure I know what the difference of black bean sauce. I would NOT recommend this place.

Best donuts and croissant donuts in the east valley in my opinion. Bosa donuts and dunkin donuts got nothing.

This was my first time at this location. The service was bad. I had to wait 15 to 20 minutes for my order. The food was ok. Their mashed potatoes with gravy is better than church's chicken and kfc. The management team needs to work on their service.  The line was close to out of the door and there were upset customers in the dining area who have not received their food while the carryout customers received their food first.  Finally, I advise to check your orders because they forgot to give me one of my side orders. Get it together management of Popeye ' s  and staff.
