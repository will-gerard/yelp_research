Food was consistent with the other Oreganos in town. The staff was attentive. Parking was terrible.

Been coming here for many years.  Although the food has had slight ups and downs I would have to say that overall it's never disappointing and the people are always very nice.  I want to give it 5 stars but I think 90% is a solid summation of my experiences here.  If your new in town this is definitely a must visit and should be a staple for a great lunch dinner or happy hour.  I order the fajitas steamed instead of with oil so it's healthier and only had an issue once getting it that way out of the kitchen (hence the 90%). It's much better that way to me.  Chips and salsa are dangerously good and they are pretty generous with them. I try to exercise self control but they usually defeat me.  Enjoy!

These guys do an amazing job on cars. Perry has been in the valley for a long time and has the best reputation in the industry. They've taken care of my cars for years and I'm always amazed at how awesome it looks.  I'm very picky and believe me, I know a good job from a bad one. Love this place. Highly recommended.

Excellent people to work with. If you need a fountain or unique garden accents you really need to go by here for some inspiration.  This is the new home builder's secret. You can turn an average yard into a real showplace with the stuff they have here.  Stop by and see John and you'll have a blast just chatting with him. Good people.

This place is a cheese ball version of the scottsdale store. It shouldn't even be called by the same name.  Sprouts is much friendlier and even the Frys across the street is cleaner and has better customer service.  I live between the scottsdale and this store and always regret not going the other way.  Enter happy and leave disappointed.

Very consistent at this location.  I hadn't been here in years and a friend recommended we stop in.  The place looked very clean and obviously well cared for and properly updated. I was pleased to see that the quality level was still very high. I frequent the one off of Camelback in Phoenix and that one is always solid too.  Unfortunately cant say that for the one off of 92nd Street. Its almost like that one has a different owner. Anyway, this location is a solid place to get good quality Mexican food with excellent service too. we arrived about 10 minutes till close on a slow night and they were very accommodating about staying open for us. Didn't even flinch when we walked in the door and asked if they were still serving. We even walked out with the staff and they were all 'thank you' and smiles. Very genuine.  Highly recommended.

Big fan of chipotle ever since they have gone 100% GMO Free. This place was on point. Clean, nice staff, pleasant greetings and good food.  It's right around the corner from my house so I will surely be back.

Way better option than the DMV. I do a lot of transactions and these people have always been very courteous and motivated to help.  I will never set foot in a DMV again if I can help it.  Highly recommended and a pleasure to work with them.

It always seems like they are understaffed at the registers. Today was the topper, when they had a person that said "I am totally new here" handling the self check out lanes and all the other lanes (except contractor lane) were closed. It was a mess, but typical of what I have come to expect from this location.  I usually go to the Shea and 101 store even though this one is closer to my house. I have had other issues here and probably average a 75% disappointment when it comes to service issues. Funny though, each time I start to forget my last experience I get reminded of why I dislike it so much by yet another bad experience.

Strange.  This sums up my overall experience here. I had a quick meeting with a pal who recommended we pop in here for a quick bite. It's been years since I have gone to Hooters but I fondly remember the experience and was happy to give it a try.  Firstly, the place does not seem clean. It had an old feeling and dos not feel very sanitary. The staff never smiles here also, which made me feel uncomfortable. They were attractive enough, but a smile adds several points to anyone's appearance and no smile deducts even more. Hate to be so superficial... But it is "Hooters".   The bacon on my burger tasted old and the bread was not soft and fresh. So I didn't eat much after the first couple of bites. My drink was also never refilled.  I felt the staff was just killing time while they become old enough to work the pole at the local strip club. The guests also seemed like they were a grabbing a bite in the way there too.  It was strange. It surely wasn't 'fun'. I'm going to stick to Firebirds when I'm in that side of town... After I get a tetanus shot.

Beautiful facility that cares about my pets. I drive all the way from Hayden and Shea to get here and it is worth the trip.  I've also referred several friends and they have all been extremely happy.  This place does a ton of charity work, which makes me glad to support them.

Everyone here was very polite and didn't mind me checking out the new 2015 cars. Even though I am not ready to buy, they were very courteous and helpful.  I'm putting them in my favorites list and will surely give them an opportunity for my business when I am ready.

Someone really needs to rethink this driveway.  Also we got our frozen drinks and they did not seem very frozen.  My friend who frequents this place says the traffic in this little parking lot can log jamb itself pretty easily. There were only two cars in the drive when we were there so all I experienced was the terribly engineered turn in the driveway. I'll pass on this place next time.

I've been coming here for years. Unfortunately it has been progressively going downhill. Last night was probably the final time I will go there.  It was a bit slow and I came in with a party of 6 around 845pm. The staff was very detached, we had to beg for everything from water to cocktails. It was so bad that I went hunting for help and wound up in the bar to ask for the manager. Both the bartender and hostess (who were watching tv) told me the manager would come to our table.... He never showed up.  So sad to see a place go downhill because of a loose staff and management. It's also been feeling dirty in there too. Didn't seem like they care anymore. Food was still good though, but with all the other issues I don't trust that they are handling it well.

The renovation looks really well done and the staff seems better than they were before. I wouldn't consider it five star yet, but the effort is there despite being short handed on my last visit and the new lamps over the tables need dusting (the iron looking ones).  Food was on par, I took some guests from home there tonight. They enjoyed it and appreciated the authentic Scenery.  I've come back for another try and glad I did. Although it's not my favorite, it is close to my house and a lot better than it used to be. Glad to see them making an effort. Good luck.

Our favorite little place is having serious issues :( This place has never been known for cleanliness... But this trip revealed a hair in the food, poor service and bad cooking. I won't be back for a while if ever.  Not the same as it used to be and I have been coming here for over 10 years.

This place was pretty dirty. I came in from the self parking lot on the forth floor and the elevator area was a disaster. The parking area itself looked like no one ever took a hose to the place.  The rooms were very dusty and although the staff was courteous I can't imagine ever coming back. I hate giving a bad review but the people that are renovating this place should invest in more cleaning people.

It's always busy here. Been around a while and still does a good job. Food overall is good and the atmosphere is very pleasant. I've frequented everything from the dining to the small grocery style counter and enjoyed most of it. Today was pretty busy so we managed to squeeze a spot on the couch next to the bar. Service was a bit off and negatives included: eggs Benedict was way too soggy, brought our cappuccinos with no sugar or spoon and server vanished after taking the order.  But despite these issues I have to say I would try this place again because the food was previously pretty good. I've never thought anything was excellent or very memorable here but it is convenient and the patio areas are nice.  Still recommended.

Went in to get my water heater replaced. Doug Cooper in large appliances helped me out. Found an 80 gallon upgrade on sale for me and arranged a quick installation.  Very pleasant man. He's actually helped me a few times with my appliances over the years and has always been a pleasure to deal with.  If your in the market I would recommend him for anything from washer and dryers to water heaters and fridges. Good man.

I haven't been here for at least a year. We (my wife and I) were coming pretty regularly back then and it just starting going downhill. The music changed, the staff was just weird and the place was becoming progressively dirty. So adios, we were out of there.   About a week ago, we were in the neighborhood and decided to give it another try... and we were very pleasantly surprised. The place place was very clean, music was suitable for the environment and the staff was perky, informative and attentive. It is obvious this place had some major changes happen and all for the better. I highly recommend this location and hope they can maintain the changes and momentum, because there are not a lot of places I like to eat.  Only criticism I could provide is the pasta salads seemed to have too much oil dressing. Keep up the good work, nice to see a place stepping it up for a change.

Oh Costco.... I show my member card as I enter and always wonder if the lady at the door is really watching. Yes, I'm the guy that thoroughly details the cart with the handy germ free wipes... While wondering why everyone doesn't do it.  The TV section always makes me feel inadequate, then I stop by the jewelry counter to make me feel better. Doesn't work.  I have to weave through the clothing area to avoid getting pulled into the latest knife or vacuum demo (which I will buy because I'm a sucker like that) only to end up in the pillow section where I have to wonder if a $100 pillow will make me a better person than the $20 one.  I don't drink, so that half of the store is pretty useless to me, but I did when I was younger and I'm glad alcohol exists because my wife would probably not have fallen in love with me if it didn't.  Also, we only eat organic and gluten free, so there are only like 20 things I can actually buy here. Nonetheless, I do manage to cheat a few samples from the elitist old people that love to take 30 minutes cooking a 3 minute snack. Plus I am grateful for the ever expanding organic options. It's like winning the lottery when I find something new.  I bought organic coconut oil which now comes in a conveniently packed 5 gallon drum. I use it often, so I bought two. I have enough for the next 48 months now.  My favorite chips showed up in bulk too. I've not only gained 10 pounds, but it's been two weeks and we are only half way through the bag.  I make a quick stop to pick up the jumbo double pack of baby Tylenol, (she will be using that until she's twelve), and grab a pair of jeans I can't try on and will have to return next week.  I'm sure to pick the shortest line but unfortunately the slowest cashier. It's not bad though, because it's entertaining to peek into people's carts and be judgmental about their choices. Lady... You do not need that pecan pie, even though I know it's a great buy for nine bucks.  Cashier: "You want a box?"  Me: "Does anyone ever say no to a box? Do you think people want to have all that stuff rolling around in their trunk?"  I would actually prefer a bag, but I get its not their thing. So she packs a tiny box so full it's impossible to carry, probably in retaliation for my comment.  I know you keep the better boxes for your favorite people!  On my way out I desperately try to ignore the fact that I could buy one of everything for under ten bucks at the Cholesterol Cafe. Move quick... Move quick.  Crap!! I put my receipt in my wallet and the Nazi checker at the door is going to be pissed. Plus the people behind me are nudging their cart in my back while I fumble to get it. Rookie mistake... My bad.  When I get back to my car I'm not even phased by the new dent. It will still take me 20 minutes to get out of here since no one looks where they are going and I have to stop every six feet to let someone out or pass by.  The whole time I can only keep asking myself one thing... Why?

We found a baby bird that needed rescuing in my backyard. I tried calling them on the phone but apparently the volunteers are very busy with the birds.  Very nice people. They were quick to take care of the baby bird.  I made a donation of $200 which I thought was cheap for the luxury of taking the baby bird off my hands and knowing it will be well taken care of. The ladies there were so nice and it was obvious they don't receive a lot of donations.  I will be sure to keep them on my Christmas list. Seems like a charity like this deserves more local support. Baby bird is happy. Wife is happy. And I am no longer in trouble for having the trees trimmed. Thank you liberty.

It's Pollo Loco, so it's never going to be terrible. Food was on point with no complaints.  Problems here were service and waiting time. We ordered lunch around 1145, so we figured we'd beat the rush by at least 15 minutes. There weren't many people in the place and we were able to get straight to the register.  But after we ordered it seemed like a really long wait. As I looked over to the other side of the restaurant I noticed two employees who ordered and got their meals before us. Seemed awkward to me that as people started coming in these two looked like they were in lunch break too.  If your in the lunch business I don't think you would take lunch at the same time as your clients. From reading some of the reviews it looks like this is a trend here. I may be back, but not when I'm pressed for time. It's apparent they have some timing issues.

I like this place. Lots of options and I haven't been disappointed yet. We maintain a Non-GMO, Organic and Gluten Free diet, so shopping anywhere else is usually a challenge.  They aren't shy about the prices they charge, but given that they have what I need I guess it works.  For the most part the staff is pretty friendly. Some of the newer people seem a little less welcoming.  Only wish they had more options in prepared gluten free and organic meals.

Between the sour faces from the cashiers and the lack of organization I'm done with this place. Going to make the Tatum location and Sprouts work instead. Last time I came in people were searching for bags in the produce section and on this trip the eggs all had a broken one in the dozen and the fresh cooked chicken (which is never ready on time) looked as though someone had actually eaten it and put it back. (Yes I understand it was a half order, learn to cut properly) The salad section always looks messy too. I was in the food service business and can tell things are being handled carelessly.  All of it would be bearable, but you can just see the lack of care that used to draw me to this place in the faces of the cashiers and staff. Almost a sour look.  You can't charge almost six bucks for a carton of organic jumbo eggs and thirteen dollars for a little cooked chicken and then be unfriendly. I was hoping it was a glitch but after multiple visits I'm going to call it quits.  (I took a picture of the chicken and posted it. So gross).

The food was surprisingly good for a restaurant attached to a retail store. The place was very roomy and servers were attentive and polite. I had the shrimp and scallops, it was a bit heavy and there are a lot of fried items on the menu. Very rich for my personal taste but it did have lots of flavor.  I would return here and enjoyed my experience. I even bought a flannel jacket while I was there. Lots and lots of flannel and camo to choose from in the store. Lol.

This place is great.  Always fresh and consistent. I enjoy going here for lunch, it's relatively quick, conveniently located and very consistent.  Look... Service is not their strong suit, good food is. I wish I could give them all five stars, but it appears the owner takes care of everyone himself. When the place is a little full the service suffers a bit. He makes up for it with a pleasant demeanor and knowledge of the menu though so I'm not sure I would change a thing.  My favorite is the spring rolls. Great app or as a light entree. Any of the dishes on the menu are a home run though. Like I said, overall the place is great and I enjoy it.  Worth a visit, even if your not vegetarian. It definitely crosses over to all palates.

I thought it was a delicious experience. We had a large take out order and brought it home. I thought the chicken was a bit dry but the ribs were spot on.  The sauce they gave us was gluten free but I don't think they had a gluten free kitchen (and they weren't pretending too).  I will return.

Not what you would expect.  This place does have the best fish tacos in town in addition to many other great Baja inspired dishes. Be careful though... The food here is addicting.  I'm personally switching the mouth watering fried fish to a healthier grilled option. It's not a disappointment.  People are very friendly and the place gets a little overwhelmed during lunch and other heavy traffic times. Hard not to be patient around all the hippie decor.  Surprisingly... Highly recommended!

This place is on fire. I came here years ago and to be honest, I was far from impressed. We now frequent this place often and I don't think there is a better organic option out there. The food is always fresh, service is on point and I'm never disappointed. Prices are a little higher than you would expect but that's the result of using organic ingredients. Well worth it.  Many gluten free options and we can't get enough of their pizza. Great transformation here and it looks to be getting better. Well done.

Well where can I start, it was all pretty bad.  I walked up to a couple of employees I was directed to that would help me get a time slot to meet with a genius about my phone problem.  After standing there listening to them talk to each other for a few minutes I realized I was being ignored. Completely ignored as if I was invisible.  So I walked over to another gentleman employee who then walked back to the same two guys, who then called me back over to set my appointment.... After he ignored me a little longer as I was directly in front of him. Seriously... I actually took pictures while I was standing there waiting. It was almost comical as I withheld the urge to pop him in the nose. Unbelievably rude.  Finally I met with a pretty nice genius guy. Unfortunately, after being there an hour, the replacement phone he gave me had the same issue I came in to resolve.  So I spent over an hour there to get absolutely no results. Oh... Since they didn't replace my screen protector I did get to buy a new one for $40... So that's something.  Apple sucks. I'm trying my luck with an android. I won't be back here again.

No Bueno....  First I asked the guy at the customer service counter where something was and he didn't know, so he asked the greeter guy (who ignored me while he was on his phone) and he sent me to rows "30-32 somewhere in there" (most vague directions I ever received at Home Depot).  While scouting around for the rows I noticed that half the store runs in sequence in one direction then doubles back in another direction. Very confusing layout. It's also laid out in hidden pockets (paint dept, etc...) so you wind up wondering into areas. Again... Very confusing.  Well... I found two lady employees in the back while I was looking in rows 30-32 and they said tables ere outside. So after looking for 10 minutes I realized the two guys up front were just as lost as I was. (They should have a map for this place).  I went outside, picked out a dirty little table with a big scratch on it and proceeded to the trash cans (they were next to the tables thank god. I didn't want to ask anymore directions). The trash cans were absolutely filthy. I've been buying these often lately for our satellite locations and have never seen them this dirty. Spider webs, etc... I got my clothes dirty just picking one out. I needed a broom too but the two displays next to the trash cans had no prices so I went hunting for them in the cleaning area.  I can go on but my thumbs are tired. In a nutshell, this Home Depot is laid out differently and totally disorganized and dirty. Most of the staff (and there is more to the story) are not polite and lack basic knowledge of the facility.  Only reason they got an extra star out of me was the lady in cleaning area asked me how I was doing politely and the cashier in the garden area was very nice.

My wife and I are in jobs where we wear suits for our business, so dry cleaning accounts for about 80% of our laundry. I have used this location in Scottsdale for a couple of years, it is close to my mother in laws and my wife is there so often that it is a convenient locale. There are closer locations and we have several options on the way there and around my house, but the staff is nice and overall I have not had any issues... except when they damaged a shirt and took a while to pay for it.  They did eventually pay, but we did have to call multiple times.  Overall I would still recommend it.

Came in for an oil change. Didn't notice my tire light was on and didn't realize I was driving on the run flat tire. Matt K, the service guy was quick to point this out.  Thank you Matt. If I would have driven away the tire (almost $400 cost) would have been ruined.  I'm more appreciative that he didn't try to scam me for a new tire. He knows this is my daughters car and is always extra careful with it.

This place is probably good for stitches or colds but I found it unprofessional and useless. Went in for a simple problem that was highly misdiagnosed. Good thing we didn't trust the prognosis and double checked with a real doctor.  Also, I didn't think the place appeared very clean in the lobby and the receptionist was very indifferent and slightly rude. The place closed at 7 and he was telling everyone that it was going to be a long wait (1.5 hours) when it was averaging only a half hour. She just wanted to be sure she went home on time.  Someone actually came In at 7:03 and she turned them away. Someone should explain to her that they weren't there for dinner, they needed help.  I guess the place would be okay if the dropped the 'Care' from their name. I would not recommend this place and will never return.  They also overcharged me for the co-pay. They can keep it. I dread just talking with the receptionist again... She was mentally draining.

Very nice people. I had a custom set of keys for a 65 Lincoln that I couldn't find a match for. I found them here in the original look.  Bill the key guy was very pleasant, took an interest in what kind of car I was working on. Very polite and the keys worked the first time (for an old car that's incredible).  Nice people, nice place, recommended.

Well... It was the best car wash. The staff was polite and it wasn't a very busy day so my car did not take a long time. I just would have preferred that the manager walk around the car to see if the water spots were gone from the passenger side.  Overall, we like this place and will continue to come.

Awesome changes. Ask for Danny the manager. He made it right right right!  Update:  I've been coming here a bit more often and it's been great. These guys are really doing an excellent job... And I'm very picky.

I've had a PO Box here for years. Service has absolutely gone downhill here. So sad to see what's becoming of the postal service. Seems like a bunch of people riding out their time until extinction at this location.  No one is friendly anymore. Customer service is non existent here.  I came in today to grab my mail and was immediately sent to the 'express door'. There were three people doing nothing and they opted to send me to stand in front of a closed door for over 10 minutes. What a joke. Terrible. I see them do this all the time.  Needless to say, I'm not a fan any longer. Sad that there is no motivation in this place. No wonder FedEx and ups are killing their business.

Great seats. Love that you can prepay. No lines.  Wine thing at the candy register is not well thought out and the menu is not real tasty.  I get the standard seats because I no longer see the value in the premiums.

Live that you can reserve seats. I will only go to this theater or the AMC Esplanade on Camelback.  The food is a little better at the Esplanade but there are better places to grab a quick bite and the seats are more comfortable at the Scottsdale Quarter (Ipic).

We planned on having dinner at the restaurant however due to the event happening that closed off all the entrances we found it easier to just order from the little downstairs counter.  Firstly, the blonde (sorry I didn't get her name) behind the counter was awesome. Just to show you that great customer service can make up some imperfections. She knew the menu, was happy to accommodate us on her little patio seats, recommended some awesome items for a gluten free diet and was extremely genuine and cordial.  That said, we opted for the oatmeal cream filled cookie while we waited for takeout. It was awesome and highly recommended. Our takeout consisted of the plantain appetizer and two different enchilada entrees. The beef was much better than the chicken.  There was no to go silverware, the enchilada containers leaked a bit and did not seem to seal correctly (lost a star on that).  I would come back. This time I will come earlier and just order a panini from the nice lady downstairs. :)

Updated.  Talk about going from hero to zero.   I came by to visit and we were a few minutes before closing time. Which means we should have been able to do business at this location because it was within normal store hours. I called the number on the door and asked to speak to a manager who seemed extremely bothered by my call and was not very pleasant to deal with. I explained I I rush from the other side of town in order to get there before they closed and someone had closed the market early. I did not expect anything for it, but I did want to make the manager aware of it. His attitude was so disturbing that I will not return and I was made to feel that this business is very inconsistent.  Feel free to read my glowing review from a previous visit. Things have obviously changed here.  Past review.

Went in with a phone issue and discovered that this location only exists to sell phones. As soon as you say you dont want to renew your contract you get the impression that your worthless here.  Although the initial salesman was polite the manger I spoke to (dark hair dark skin woman) let me know they could not help me and was pretty arrogant about it.  Yes. I have both worthless insurances on my phone.  Bad management.

Update.  The manager's name is Christine.  I had the displeasure of having to come back here because my new phone was delivered in the wrong color and memory.  Needless to say the experience was equally as terrible and once again the manager (Christine) was as rude and unpleasant as ever.  The rest of the staff was polite and you could see that they were compensating and apparently used to her lack of people skills.

The place is beautiful. We eat gluten free and felt the choices were limited.  The bar is nice and I would guess the place is good for drinks. We were here too early to tell.

Almost always have an issue getting prescriptions here. They've lost, misplaced and forgotten a number of times over the years.  To be honest, I didn't realize how bad they were until I went to the one near Lincoln and Scottsdale Road. Those guys were polite, fast and on point.  The location could be cleaner and Staff at this location can be a bit creepy too. I'd say management needs an overhaul.

Theater was very warm, service was slow and order was incorrect yet we were billed for things we sent back. Ice cream was warm by the time we got spoons. Went to see Batman and this was do bad I think I will go to Ipic and see it again. I wasn't really a fan of the office chairs and thought they could have done a better job with the layout. People were walking in front of us the whole time the movie was on.  I didn't complain at the theater because we aren't coming back and free passes, etc... Would have been useless.  I hate to see a place try so hard to change things up and yet get it so wrong.

Went in to get my phone upgraded and was told I was next in line by the manger checking people in. There were 3 employees plus him just standing around doing nothing while I sat there and waited.  Told the manager I was going to have to leave and his response was 'ok'.  I should really look into a different carrier anyway. I have 6 phones with these guys and in sure I can do better.

Great little spot for lunch. Food is excellent and authentic. It's a little spicy off the menu, but the do have some gringo light options.  I take clients to lunch here often and haven't been disappointed. Only negative is the parking, but that's not terrible.

Dan the bartender was a pretty nice and casual guy. Music had a nice peppy rhythm to it. I grabbed a little lunch at the bar. Everything was pretty perfect including the breeze coming through the back doors.  I like this place. Very nice people and atmosphere.  I ate the wedge. Well done!

What an amazing little place. They have gluten free options and if you call ahead they will set aside your order, because they bake fresh everyday and always sell out.  Nice people. Always a pleasure to visit them!

Great concept. Healthy options and fresh juices. You won't be disappointed.  Staff was friendly and fun, you could tell they actually liked working there.  A must visit when I'm in Old Town Scottsdale.

Always great. Consistent and healthy. Plus lots of gluten free options.  The decor is also really fun and understated. Concept is great, I can see why it's always busy.  Looks like they are expanding the dining area and bathrooms. Should be pretty cool.  Love it.

Beware... This could easily become an addiction!  My wife and I constantly stop here on the way home for a little dinner to go. it has definitely become one of our favorite places. The food is extremely consistent and delicious. I love the atmosphere because it always makes you feel happy when you come in there. The staff is very accommodating and seem to enjoy their job. If it sounds like I can't say enough good things about the place, that's because it's true. Highly recommended.

I felt welcomed and cared for all the way through.  These guys have always been the Carwasher chain to watch here in the valley.  Although this location is a little off the path and not really the cheapest option, I would still highly recommend it. The staff was courteous, facility was very clean and comfortable and my car was so sparkly it felt like brand new.  They were a little understaffed at the finishing area and I personally did not think much of it as I was enjoying the fountain and a cold coffee, however, the manager was quick to apologize, which I felt was very sincere. Especially since I don't think it took any longer than any other car wash I've had.   It's also important to note that these guys always get involved in many local charities and support fallen officers. For that alone I would recommend them but it's a huge bonus that they do a great car wash too!

Our waitress was really nice. Helpful with my wife's allergies issues.  We both has steaks and they didn't disappoint. Hot plates and delicious sides.  Table next to us sent back the scallops twice, but in all fairness, she seemed hard to please. We felt sorry for her date. Only downfall was that the seating in the area I was at was pretty tight and overcrowded.

Maybe I'm just used to the store I frequent in North Scottsdale. People here seemed a little unfriendly, and I don't just mean the staff... The patrons seemed a little weird too. No one smiles in this place.  There was an enormous yogurt section, but I struggled to find jumbo organic eggs. Hmmmm.. Weird.  Wine area looked like it had a good variety, but it seems like the focus here was to compete with the other specialty stores in the area and not a grocery store. I'll just wait until I get back to my side of town before I stop here on my way home again.

It's nice, but when your there you can't help but get the feeling they could be doing it a little better. Breakfast could be a little larger portions (even if it costs a bit more), patio could be a little cleaner, tables could be spaced a little more comfortably, coffee could be a little more interesting, etc... Love that it's near the lake and close to our house. Great stop while your on the green belt and good quality was good.  Four stars is a bit aggressive for my experience but I don't want to deter anyone from coming here. Support local businesses. Too many Starbucks out there... Step it up guys. I'm happy to give you five stars if you do. Your not too far from it.

Had a great night at the patio bar. The bartender was very pleasant and knowledgeable about gluten allergies which made my wife very happy.  The layout is great and the food was ben better. Very interesting space with a very clean and open kitchen.  I highly recommend it for a casual night out.

This place is fantastic for a few beers and some amazing pizza! Love the casual atmosphere, it's like a sports bar but not too cheesy. My wife loves coming here because it is welcoming to women. Unlike a lot of sports places.  Great job!

Nice place. Everything looks clean and fresh. A little hard to fine but it is sandwiched between Jimmy John's and five guys burgers. A little bit of a wait but worth it for healthy options.  The fresh juices and bowls are priced reasonably. Be sure to ask for 'light ice' they got a little heavy handed with it on the drinks I ordered.

Food was really good here. It was a busy night and I opted for take out. They lost a star because I found the ordering process and customer service lacking a bit and clumsy.  Other than that the food was very tasty. Several gluten free options along with a nice assortment of gelato to enjoy. Atmosphere was very 'Italian Market' feeling and the bar looked entertaining.  I would opt to eat at the bar with friends next time. They had a nice assortment of pizza by the slice. Love the open kitchen. I will try again and see if they can get that missing star back.

These guys are awesome. Excellent workmanship and quality. They take a lot of time and care with each vehicle and the owners personally do the work. I highly recommend them.

It appears that this is not the business. The business is David Wilson's Toyota of Las Vegas.  When you call a regular person answers. Not the dealership. This is very confusing and perhaps Yelp should clarify it.

Food was great. The service was ok, even though I don't usually like the 'order at the counter' type of dining. However, I did like the self serve juice bar.  Great healthy options and the price point is palatable. Last time I was here they forgot a couple of things in my to go order so check carefully before leaving. Chicken tortilla soup is a great choice.

In the words of someone at my table..."This is how a perfectly nice place goes out of business."  We popped in for a quick lunch and were greeted by the waitress who casually told us to sit anywhere. She was the only waitress working and apparently she was not interested in working.  After sitting there for about 20 minutes the bartender finally came over and took our order and dropped chips (no water, no drinks). We finally got water after another 15 minutes but our orange juices took even longer. We were literally there 45 minutes before our OJ hit the table. We were contemplating leaving just seconds before.  Bartender was a friendly gentleman but he was overwhelmed or not very organized... Or a little of both.  When the food came it was ok. Not memorable, just ok and not bad. We had the breakfast burrito which someone at our table said it tasted like Taco Bell but with more potatoes. Another guest said his tortilla egg thing was soggy like it was under heat lamps for a bit. In short, it was a train wreck. I even had to waive down someone to pay the bill.  I will not return and don't recommend anything about the place. Staff never smiled, ignored our table and wasn't doing a very good job with the other tables either. Especially considering the place only had like 5 tables (less than 1/4 full).  No heart, No passion.

Had an awesome lunch on the patio. My friend had the chicken bowl and I had the steak bowl. Very tasty, lots of flavor and pretty good size servings. The patio was amazing this time of year and everyone of the staff was pleasant and polite.  Our server was on point without being to overbearing. They discounted my bill a little because they were out of something I ordered. Hey... I'll take that as a trade. Lol.  Had a great time and thought the place had a very unique atmosphere. Highly recommended.

Been here several times now and I feel they just can't get it together.  I've actually only had one order out of about ten that has been correct. I don't know if the cashiers can't hear me or the place is just not polished enough yet in the kitchen.  Food quality is there, just missing the mark a bit on presentation and organization. I would still go here though and if you haven't been it worth the trip. Hope they get the little details ironed out soon.

These guys treated me like a king here. Seriously... Had a coffee and muffin while I walked the new car lot this morning looking at some great deals on Lincoln cars.  I was pleasantly surprised to see they have upgraded the wheels in the SUV to 22" which saves me a lot by not having to buy new ones. I have a 1967 suicide Continental and wanted to see if I could match it up with something new so my garage looks cooler.  These Manager walked me around and we tested color samples to see how close we could get. I'm so glad I don't sell cars... These guys were very patient with me.  Thank you to the staff there, very polite and you made my visit extremely enjoyable.
