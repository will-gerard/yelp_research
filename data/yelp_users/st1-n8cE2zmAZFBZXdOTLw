I will never go in this restaurant again. I have been there several times, with each visit the manager being more rude and insulting than the last time. My friends could not believe the things I told them he said to me during my last (definitely last) visit.  You can get better New York food elsewhere without the New York attitude.  Complaints to the headquarters go unanswered. So I assume Schlotzsky's does not care about customers.

I am usually not happy with AHS. But in this case, they referred Smokey Garage Doors and I was very satisfied. Joshua showed up on time, was very knowledge, professional, responsive and easy-to-work with. I would highly recommend them.

Genuine New York-style Chinese food! Excellent quantity, quality, and price. Best Chinese food in Phoenix metropolitan area.

The new Esplanade provides a nice afternoon or evening out. The price for the regular movies is comparable to 3D movies and much more worth it.  The seats (especially the ones in Cinema Suites, which fully recline!) are comfortable. The wait staff is very friendly and attentive. The refreshments are good, and food and drink prices are not inflated and more reasonable that those at the sports stadiums. An imported beer and unlimited popcorn is $13, not more than most theaters' large combos.  Parking is validated. If you are the ultimate movie fanatic, are not picky about atmosphere, and can go to movies at 10 in the morning, you can find a better deal elsewhere. But if you are a regular Joe, you will enjoy an occasional movie at the Esplanade.

I have been using Manning Sprinkler Services for 17 years. They are always timely, professional and efficient. It is easy to complain about bad service; there's plenty of it here in Phoenix.  Not enough people applaud good customer service. I highly recommend Manning Sprinkler Services.

Eduardo's Cleaners were hired via Angie's List to clean and organize my garage. They were on time, professional, polite, and efficient. In a short amount of time, they miraculously restored my 2 car garage, even rearranging items on the shelves and washing the floor. Great job!
