Came here twice on 'goth' night.  Both times the place was dead.  Probably no more than 10 people in the entire place with only 2 people dancing on the large dance floor.  I just don't understand why they can't get people in here and even more puzzling is the fact that they are able to remain open despite the lack of patronage.

The food here is generally overpriced and over-rated.  Nothing special and the portion sizes leave much to be desired.  If you're looking for somewhere 'sceney', however, this place will deliver.    One thing you notice if you go there before sunset (when there's a decent amount of daylight shining into the restaurant) is the dirt.  The backs of the white plastic chairs are covered in dirty handprints.  Nothing some bleach and elbow grease won't cure, but still makes you wonder about the cleanliness of the place overall (not something you want to be worrying about when you're trying to enjoy a meal).

Atmosphere good.  Food...not so much.  I recently ate here for the first time and, unfortunately, I can't say anything good about the food.  I ordered a chicken shwarma sandwich and expected a hot middle eastern sandwich filled with flavorful chicken sauteed with onions and spices and accompanied with crisp fresh veggies.  What I got was FAR from what I expected.  The pita bread was your typical crappy faux Wendy's style doughy flat bread 'pita', not a regular pita pocket.  Inside was some flavorless, cold, unseasoned chicken (and when I say flavorless I mean indistinguisable from a mouthful of cardboard).  They didn't even bother to put basic salt and pepper on this sorry meat.  The remainder of the sandwich consisted of raw zuchinni (WTF?!), chopped tomatoes, 3 leaves of romaine lettuce, and some bits of red onion.  None of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned.  Oh, there was also some hummus/tahini 'sauce' mixed in there (presumably for flavor), but I have never tasted anything so flavorless.  I imagine that wall spackle has more flavor and pizazz than this 'sauce'.  Come on Paisley, does your cook even TASTE what comes out of the kitchen?  Add some flavor to your food.  You could start with salt, fresh lemon juice, garlic, pepper, and high quality olive oil.  It's really not that hard.

Modified is a good venue, though somewhat small and not necessarily the best in terms of acoustics.  They always seem to get some of the more interesting indie acts and attract your typical downtown indie-hipster/artsy crowd.

I went there again for breakfast recently and I'm afraid that I must downgrade my rating.  We were in line to order and only had two people ahead of us, one of the LGO girls approached us and recommended that we go outside and place our order with the barrista (AKA coffee lady) because it would be 'faster'.  So we did and ended up waiting for another almost 10 mins just to place our order.  Maybe she meant it would piss me off 'faster'.    The breakfast I received was barely room temperature.  The eggs were supposed to be accompanied with avocado which (technically) I suppose they were, however, I assumed that this meant more than 3 dice sized pieces of avocado.  I felt like Gulliver; was I growing or was my food just getting smaller?    I asked one of the girls who work at LGO if the three ultra-mini cubes of avocado was considered to be a normal portion, she just looked at me like she was coming down off a pot binge and said she wasn't sure and that if I was 'OK with it', I should just go ahead and eat it.  Duh...ya think?  I'm thinking she didn't quite make the cut when they were recruiting at NASA.   Then I went to the guy at the pizza oven and showed him my mini food and he just laughed out loud and asked someone to throw some more avocado on my plate.  Anyway, I finally ate my now almost cold and fairly flavorless breakfast and must say that LGO seems to be resting on its laurels.  The food quality is just so-so.    I think this place is just another case of the 'Emperor's New Clothes' with people thinking 'Everybody else is in orgasmic rapture over this place, I guess that means that I should be too'.  Well, I'm here to say that the emperor is buck naked.

Still going strong after all these years and rightly so, Thai Lana rocks it every time.  Great food, fast courteous service, and mom-and-pop ambiance.  You really can't go wrong with any of the food here, but I especially love all of their curry dishes.

I used to be a regular here, but have stopped going because of the atrocious service I received on my last visit.  I will admit they do have some decent food and, depending on who you get as a server, the service can be decent too.  However, my last experience was just over the top.  My companion and I started off by ordering two coffees.  After waiting for about 15 minutes, the waiter finally came back with two cups of coffee, one of which was only half full.  We both stared with puzzlement at the coffee and when he came back a short while later, I pointed out the curiosity before us.  He looked down at the two cups, laughed, and then proceeded to pick up the full cup and pour part of its contents into the one that was only half full.  In the process, he spilled part of the coffee all over the table and then left us staring in bewilderment at the two, now semi full cups, and the puddle of coffee before us.  After another tedious waiting period, he finally came back for our order and when we pointed out the puddle of coffee on the table, he again snickered and sloppily sopped it up with a rag.  The remainder of the breakfast was similarly sloppy in service.

I love Sprouts and do most of my grocery shopping there.  I will say that some of their prices are not competitive with my other favorite grocery store, Trader Joes, however, for the most part, I do find that their fruit and veg is reasonably priced as are many of their meats.

This place is all about the 'upsell'.  Once they get you in the door with their low memberships they start pumping their 'supplements' and personal training, which is their main revenue stream.  You have to be very assertive with them and tell them to back off, otherwise they will just keep coming after you to get you to buy their products and services.  This is the most aggressive gym I have ever been to in terms of their constant and relentless upsell efforts.  It can be a real turn off.

This place was just OK for me.  The service is slow and they don't make enough use of the outdoor patio dining space.  They only had 3 tables out there and the space could easily and comfortably accomodate at least another 3 tables.  I had the breakfast that comes with the hamburger and the meat had zero flavor.  Clearly, the chef has not heard of seasonings.

This bar's got personality.  Not mainstream or sceney, just laid back with good atmosphere and vibe.

Total ripoff!.  I ordered an iced tea, a salad, and a filet mignon and my total bill was almost $55!  To add insult to injury, I was still starving when I left.  The salad was beyond bland and consisted of about a dozen small lettuce leaves with a couple of strings of purple cabbage that were completely under-dressed resulting in overpriced cow feed.    The filet cost $32 and came with nothing but 3 miniature beets (and I mean about the size of a radish) and 2 small lettuce leaves.  The meat was completely under-seasoned and bland as you could get.    So that's it.  For about $40 I got a minuscule piece of meat on a paper thin slice of bread, 3 radish sized beets and a few lettuce leaves.  I wanted to hit  In and Out Burger afterwards to kill my hunger pangs.  What a weak meal!  I'll will never go back to this establishment again.  Granted it has good ambiance and stylish decor, but that only makes it a restaurant of style over substance.   I know these guys have major overhead to pay for in their new location, but ripping off your customers is not the way to do it!

This is probably the most 'upscale' gay bar in Phoenix.  I would say it's Phoenix's version of The Abbey in L.A. (though it's still doesn't come close to The Abbey's cool factor).  They've done a great job with the outdoor patio and the booth seating.  The drinks are OK, I've had better at AZ88, but over all, it's a great bar with a fun mixed crowd.

What can I say, this place is a Scottsdale staple.  20 years and still going strong.  I do miss their old menu (circa 1990-1995), but they have enough decently priced and varied menu selections to satisfy everyone.   This is a 'see and be seen place' with an always fun and eclectic crowd (old, young, gays, straights, dressed up, dressed down) with a DJ spinning some sweet house music on the right nights.  The drinks may seem pricey, however, they certainly don't skimp on the liquor and if you're a lightweight, you'll be flat on your ass after your second cocktail. Waitstaff can be hit or miss.

Ticoz is not a bad place.  The menu is eclectic-american and the service has always been friendly, consistent, and attentive.  All the food I've had there has been decent and the prices aren't bad either.  This is a gay friendly restaurant so it's a good place to consider for a same-sex date.  It's also a good place for large groups.

This is definitely a place to hang out, people watch, and throw back a few cocktails.  They've done a remarkable job with the outdoor dining/bar/bocce ball area.  You almost forget that on the other side of the fence is a stripmall/parking lot asphalt wasteland.  The food here is decent and reasonably priced american fare though I haven't had anything that's blown me away.

I've never had a bad meal here.  It's a low key family owned joint with courteous service.  Everything is fresh and tastes like something your vietnamese grandmother would make (assuming you had a grandmother and she was vietnamese) ;)  Try it.  It's a Scottsdale gem.

Great little place for dancing the night away to really sweet house music on the rooftop Saturday nights.  Not a fan of the hip-hop downstairs, but if that's your thing, you may want to check it out too.

I went here one night during a torrential downpour.  Gail force winds, thunder and lightening that sent chills down your spine.  The sign was dimly lit and the place was almost empty, the vibe was definitely very David Lynch.  Seriously, if Lynch were to open a bar, or shoot one for a movie, this would be it.  Owned by the same people who brought you Emerald Lounge, this place is definitely a step up from the Emerald, but still retains a bit of that kitschy feel.  Go here if you want to get away from the cookie-cutter Scottsdale club scene.

First, let me start off by saying that I used to have a love affair with Roka.  The Omakase was the multi-course sumptuous dining experience I selected every time I visited.  They had a $99 option and a $128 one and both were an exotic extravaganza of delectable delights (the $128 Omakase promised extra exotic, pricier ingredients).  The Omakase is an improvisational dining experience with consideration given to the diner's food preferences and allergies.  When I used to order the Omakase, I always left dazzled by the presentation, colors, textures, and flavors of the dishes I received.  Every dish was superb and left you anticipating your next experience.  Sadly, the Omakase is now a shadow of its former self, sorely lacking across every culinary dimension and I have twice walked away feeling disappointed and ripped off.  In the past year, they have eliminated the $99 option, but kept the $128 one.  No matter, as long as the dishes maintain the same quality and consistency.  When I order the Omakase, I expect to receive exciting and surprising dishes that highlight the chef's creativity and artistry.   What I don't expect to receive are generic dishes that can be ordered off the menu a la carte for a fraction of the hefty $128 price tag.  Here are the 6 courses I received at my last $128 experience (with accompanying a la carte prices): Shishito Peppers with Ponzu and Bonito - $7, a SINGLE scallop with curry sauce (since ONE scallop is not an a la carte menu item, I am going to be be generous and use the pricing for the Robata Grilled Scallops with Yuzu Shiso) - $15, Assorted Steamed Shellfish with Tomato Miso - $23, Wagyu Beef Tataki - $18, Crispy Brussels Sprouts  - $7, and a lackluster presentation of dessert which consisted of one scoop of ice cream - $4 and Cassis, Pear, & Blood Orange Mousse - $12 ( the dessert was also accompanied by a razor thin slice of pear, one slice of mango, and two slices of kiwi).  Had each of items been ordered a la carte, the sum total would have been $86, a $42 savings on the $128 Omakase price tag.    Again, not only were the dishes not in keeping with the grand billing that Roka gives the Omakase: "Roka Akor's Tour De Force, Featuring Our Signature Dishes and Inspired Creations" (not really sure where the 'inspired creations' part comes in since they are all a la carte dishes), the presentations have gone downhill too.  Desserts used to be magnificently presented on multi-platform dishes with tons of decorative fruits, flowers, and greenery.  Now they come on simple, small white plates.  This 'Tour de Force' is now nothing but a Tour de Flop and a colossal rip-off. As such, I can no longer recommend this place, nor will I be returning.  The love affair is definitely over.

Sadly, this place is a considerable drive from where I live, however, I have eaten here twice and both times were an excellent experience.  Everything I had was delicious including a very delicately flavored soup that was quite filling despite appearing as though it wouldn't be.

I had to go back to get my hair fixed here, because the girl who cut my hair gave me a lopsided haircut. My hair was literally 2 to 3 inches longer on one side (and this was not intended to be an asymmetrical haircut). Bizarrely enough, she was completely incapable of seeing this fact and despite the fact that I was showing her the side that was longer she kept cutting the opposite side and making the hair even more lopsided. Maybe she was dyslexic and was flipping the sides around in her mind. Anyway, I finally gave up and decided I did not want her to screw up what was left of my hair anymore so I said I was happy and left. I have never had a haircut that has been so obviously lopsided. Do not recommend at all.

First of all, they have done a fantastic job with the interior decor of this place (formely a noodle shop).  They have a fine selection of wines and the bar area is very sleek, cool, and inviting.  I came here for a hearty dinner and was not disappointed.  We started of with some delicious home made bread (made, I believe, in their onsite wood-fired oven), wonderfully flavorful salad, and a calamari which was lightly battered and melted in your mouth like butter.  For my entree I had a delicious medley of seafood over linguine.  Everything was excellently prepared and impeccably served from beginning to end.  The meal was rounded off with tiramisu and some homemade limoncello.  Bravo Amarone!  P.S. Amarone's much smaller sister restaurant (Pizza A Metro in Phoenix) is just as good if you're looking for a more casual pizza bistro dining experience.

Trader Joe's has a great selection of fairly priced foods.  This location opened somewhat recently and has become a favorite of mine because of its more spacious floor plan (relative to most other TJ's).  The only gripe I have is that the parking spaces can be a bit limited.

I must say I was very impressed with the attentive and courteous service  at The Mission. This is a beautiful restaurant with warm and inviting interior and exterior decor and an excellently devised menu of flavorful dishes.  They have many South American culinary delights and unique plays on more familiar meals.  I highly recommend this place with two thumbs up.

Some adjectives that come to mind when describing Petite Maison include: quaint, cozy, warmth, and personality.  This restaurant is definitely an Old Town gem.  Housed in the former location of Baby Kay's Cajun Kitchen, it oozes character and charm.  I went there with a large group for brunch and found the service decent and food impeccable.  Everyone was pleased with their menu selections which included some delicious savory crepes and warm sweet beignets.  We ate inside, as it was a bit chilly, but I look forward to going back when it's warmer to enjoy more of  their menu and lovely outdoor patio.

Oh, man, I so wanted to like this place.  I recently tried Peruvian food for the first time in San Francisco and I decided to give Villa Peru a try because of the rave reviews.  Honestly, the only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because of the super-enthusiastic waiter.  In terms of food, there is much to be desired.  I ordered Arroz con Pollo and sadly, the 'Arroz' part of this pairing went straight in the trash after two bites because it was incredibly undercooked.  After the first bite of semi-raw rice, I decided to have a second because I was incredulous that such a simple step as checking to make sure that their rice is properly cooked could have been omitted.  Second bite, just as crunchy as the first. Furthermore, the 'cilantro rice' they pride themselves on is simply a medley of rice mixed with some green ingredient (I'm guessing that's the cilantro) plus what is clearly frozen mixed veggies (peas, corn, and carrot).  The frozen bagged veggies are just lazy and remind me of food you'd feed a toddler.  Moving on to the 'Pollo'.  This very small piece of chicken had NO flavor whatsoever.  It was a sad bird sitting on a giant pile of crunchy under-cooked rice.  The bird was so sad, I think I even saw it shed a tear.    Finally, I have to agree with a previous reviewer regarding their lunch menu pricing.  I cannot see how such a simple meal (assuming it at been cooked properly) with such humble ingredients could warrant a $14 price tag.  We're not talking foie gras here, folks.  It's just chicken and a side of rice (or in my case, a giant pile of rice with a side of chicken).  They've got to drop their lunch menu entree prices by at least $5 to be competitive.  Bottom line, I simply cannot recommend this place given the depressing food and the comically high price point.

OK, I've been here twice and I have to give this Mexican Modern restaurant an A+ for ambience.  They have clearly taken care to really focus on the decorative details.  The food, unfortunately, is another matter entirely.  Dinner portions are 'tapas style' which I believe is just an excuse for them to present excruciatingly small portions at uncomfortably high price points.  I ordered  the pulpo which was beautifully presented, but short on flavor.  The chicken tacos were likewise beautifully presented, but were virtually absent of any actual chicken.  Each small corn tortilla was covered in a mound which consisted almost entirely of a red mole type sauce which had a single note flavor and drowned out all the other ingredients.  My dinner companion ordered a tamale which came out in a modern deconstructed style, but portion size was again an issue.  This tamale was certainly no more than a third of the size of a normal tamale and the ingredients were also drowning in mole sauce making it a one note experience.  Including tax and tip, $26 for two miniscule dishes is simply too high a price to pay regardless of cute decor.  Not sure about the long term prospects of this establishment and given the history of this particular location and the abundance of dining choices in Old Town, they really need to bring their A game in order to succeed.  Another disappointed reviewer below wonders why she didn't stroll over to The Mission which, for the same price point, would have provided a far heartier meal.  I would have to agree that for a complete dining experience, including creative and flavorful latin cuisine, The Mission is a far superior option.

The Blue Hound at the hip and stylish Palomar Hotel made me howl with happiness.  Will you have to drop some significant green at The Blue?  Sure. But the service on the night I visited was pristine and attentive.  Presentation fantastic.  Interesting mixture of colors, flavors, and textures all around.  I will say that the roast cauliflower appetizer was a tad too undercooked for my taste, but the combination with pistachios and raisins was an nice blend of flavors.  If you're looking for a delightfully swanky downtown dinner and cocktail spot, this place is it.
