I didn't get ANY service at the Indian Bend store. And I do have to complain that in the past the totally fake "Welcome to Ulta!" got on my nerves. Wasn't comfortable in Tempe Marketplace store either. Made a trip to the Camelback store. Only waited a minute for ROCHELLE to help me. Awesome! Personable, professional, enthusiastic, knew her stuff! Bought everything she recommended. WOW. What a difference she made. Worth the drive anytime.

Took my mother newly in town to check out Morning Squeeze Saturday morning, but was expecting the line that we saw out front. Decided to look elsewhere but as we turned the corner, voila! A little pastry/breakfast place, and got rock star parking. Only two of the dozen or so tables were occupied. Although I am not a big fan of the over-enthusiastic greeting, I would have liked a little more "thanks for coming in!", but we were sat promptly. Coffee was good, omelette was DELICIOUS, fresh fruit and berries topped with just enough whipped cream and powered sugar, and the almond croissant was the best ever. You have to request water, though. I would definitely go back here anytime. A  secret find! Tell your friends, excellent pastries to go. Looks like they have a wine license as well.

Usually a big fan but very disappointed in this location. I am familar with their training staff to greet/say hello to EVERYONE, but this can get annoying when one is not even making eye contact with you. It was FREEZING inside the restaurant and even at the outside bar. Initial greet at bar was pleasant but name was never given. Once we ordered bartender really never noticed us again. I was going to ask about temperature but couldn't catch her eye. Saw one patron go get a coat from her car, which I was forced to do as well. 2nd shift came on and proceeded to talk about her school problems at loud volume for an extended period of time, then changed into her work shirt BEHIND THE BAR. Everyone seemed preoccupied with the obvious regulars at the end  of the bar. food was good as usual.

Yes, I was craving a burger at 10 in the morning. I went to the McDonalds across the street first just becaused I was heading east. When the gentleman came over the intercom I could hear some snickering and laughter; that made me happy. I like people to enjoy their job. When I ordered a burger he told me they weren't serving lunch yet. I said "okay, thanks then" but as I drove past the window I felt stared at like "who wants a burger at 10am?" Young punk... I crossed the street, and at the JITB intercom I asked, "Can I get a burger right now?" The man responded, "You can have whatever you like." I ordered, and when I pulled up to the window was greeted by a genuine smile and he asked me. "How was your service today?" Awesome. I will never go back to McDonald's.

I've always loved this place, but we were disappointed with our usual orders (sloppy, non-caring food) and bartenders that were the same, never checked back- no personality, no interaction...yes we know you are busy the last week of Spring Training, but we are locals that would have hung out all summer...get a barback during busy shifts and put someone in the kitchen who cares.

We made the mistake of showing up at 4 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon. Live band was incredibly LOUD. Surprising that there was an open table on the patio, but were not greeted for at least 15 minutes. Saw lots of servers LOOK RIGHT AT US with no acknowledgement. Finally grabbed a busser and said, "we have not been greeted, 3 waters please." When she finally came over I asked for a reccomendation on perhaps a house cocktail? She said, "All of our drinks are listed in this menu." I know. I just had 15 minutes to read it. Had a beer and left. Really awful. Never again.

Wow. my salad (may have taken a little long) was the envy of the bar! Everyone wanted to know what i got.  The beer was great, but the service amazing. All were good, but AMANDA was GREAT! Wish i lived closer to come 2/3 times a week. Good job everyone.

This place makes me crazy. I would really want to love it here. Close to my house, good beer on draft, good salads, good pizza. (Too small for my boyfriend; he's not coming back.) I NEVER get greeted quickly here. I sat at the bar for 10? minutes at lunchtime. and at least 3 people walked by. They must have seen me; it's like they avoid making eye contact and won't offer a glass of water until they have time. This has happened every time I've been there. Once we were seated the service improved, but I had to go from irate to barely satisfied.

I love this studio. So many different teachers with different styles to choose from! The studio itself is clean and welcoming, the staff personable and helpful. The benefit of also getting to practice at the beautiful Phoenician Resort is a definite PLUS!! I don't feel like I am just "going to class", but rather that I am part of a yoga community; I have made friends here and am learning to feel my wings!

This staff could not interact with us  less. We intrtoduced ourselves by name. Nothing. Got a refill when our beers were low. One star. These girls stare at the bar top and really seem to engage with only those who are regulars or "tippers". Being in the industry I feel badly giving 10 percent but there was NO interaction that would make me give them anything more.

Finding Tim and Absolute Pet Care was such a BLESSING! Our dog had been traumatized by prior kenneling experiences, and we were planning an upcoming out-of-town trip. Tim came to the house, had great suggestions,and got along splendidly with our difficult dog. We completely trusted him. I highly recommend Absolute Pet Care.

Wanted to specifically do a shout out to a particular person. This store has always been convenient for us to get to, and we've never had to wait long. Finally took the plunge to get a grown-up's phone, and Jon G. was exceptional service. Anyone that can put up with my and my boyfriend's personalitys for that amount of time deserves an award. He was very clear, concise, and informative.

I always feel intimidated when I walk in this store. I know the products are expensive, but I am always floored when I see the price tags, and the staff seems snooty. Yes, they may give a good fit and have great stuff, but I think  more enthusiastic personnel is required here, especially at these prices.

Shame on these owners for considering closing this establishment. I believe you live out of town and are not happy with the profits? We have been trying to establish OTW as a place of destination, but we needed your help! What a great bar! And service! (John and Tom.) And the food! Way better than Distrito! (I don't know why...?) How DARE you not give this place a second chance! PLEASE come live in Scottsdale and hand carry guests to this superbly great place. Please!

I waited a week to write this. Still fuming about our "experience". It was our first time so we did no come in the front door, but rather an entrance by the bar. After scoping the situation, we asked the HOST if we could sit at one of the high tops in the bar area. Sure! We sat 5 minutes without being greeted. Watched the host lean on things and banter with staff. A server came by with a plate of onion rings "Onion rings?" she asked. Nope, not us. Next table, nope. Third table was a winner. Also saw another server come out of kitchen with a plate of food in each hand, walk slowly toward the dining area, looked bewildered, and went back into kitchen. I KNOW you have only been open 3 weeks, but I would START with table numbers, Nimbus. Our server finally arrived in a very casual manner. We ordered waters and 2 beers. Table next to us ordered another round, they got served first. We thought it was strange that there were no coasters or bevnaps. It was also hard to believe the let their hostess come in looking slovenly, wearing a wife beater with exposed, dirty, twisted bra straps, jeans, and dirty tennis shoes. While our server came back to our table, the manager joined him and said, "well, at least you got this table water." We asked if they had coasters, he said he just hadn't brought any cocktail napkins. I asked if  they could adjust the air, I could hear/feel the A/C blowing at 7pm at night. She said no. I asked if she was the GM and she said "no, I'm just a lttle peon manager-" and flittled away. Our 2nd round took a while and when arrived had lost it's head and was down 1/2 inch from the top. Sorry Nimbus, I love you in Tucson. We were fully planning on eating here, the food looked decent, we could see the kitchen from where we sat and they seemed to be keeping up quite well. the beer was good. If I started a new business, I would overstaff and give servers 2 or 3 tables until you got dialed in. You were obviously overwhelmed.

I went to "The House" when they first opened. We walked from my girlfriend's house~ (what joy to be so close!) We sat on the beautiful patio. Our server Luis was amazing, attentive and professional.  We shared everything. We started with the burrata which Luis split for us at the table with a history of how it is made. We then shared a steak that was also cut and split by our server. Delicious.The owner came by to ask how everything was, a very nice touch. I found myself with nothing to do on Christmas Eve. I stopped by The House. I "checked in" on Facebook. On recommendation I had the newly added tomato soup. Amazing, great presentation and with beautiful roasted corn to add texture. Two friends showed up! With their well-behaved dog so we moved to the patio- there I had the duck confit sandwich and the manager Sal came by an recommended a glass of the the Bell Glos (sp?) which knocked my socks off. We were also treated to a sample of the house-made cinnamon whiskey, which was excellent. My friends had to leave, I moved back to the bar for the cinnamon cake (marvelous) and coffee. I felt  guilty that the coffee is so labor intensive but SO worth it, and the staff wasn't too busy- this was the best cup of coffee I've ever had . Everything was so wonderful and I cannot wait to go back again! I think what chef Matt Carter does best is created "cravable" foods- thing you can't stop thinking about and want to go back for. He does it well.

I just want to say again that I had another exquisite visit to The House. I was invited to a bridal shower on December 29th. The patio could not have been more comfortable or inviting. It truly felt like we were at someone's home. I was so AMAZED at how much I enjoyed the food! I was still so stuffed as I tried to taste more of the shared pork dish (only on Sundays) and it's accompaniments. The service was stellar. I would recommend hosting an event here anytime.

Just WOW again. Came by on foot with my dog and decided to dine at The House for lunch. Again, the patio incredibly comfortable, my dog welcomed with water. My ice tea very good and refreshing, the arugula salad great. Service fantastic from newbie Nicole, and managers Debbie and Watson stopped by to see how everything was. On Debbie's recommendation I had the chicken parmesan sandwich. This is something I would have never considered on my own and it was Amazing. Thank you to The House!

I really don't want to let this secret out, I want to keep it all to myself. This place is COOL. You don't need to dress up, but you will feel more a part of the ambience if you don't wear flip flops. I don't want to give too much away, just go and see for yourself. This is a hidden treasure like Kazbar is. Don't expect to sit at the bar, it's only a 5 seater. Love love love it here.
