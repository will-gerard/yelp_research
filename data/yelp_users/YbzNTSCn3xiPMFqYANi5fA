Had lunch there today, the carne asada tacos on flour tortillas were really great.  Also had chips and guac which were good also.  Went with a friend and she had the same thing, both of us loved it, seriously good carne asada tacos.

Had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich, it was really good.  Great atmosphere so long as you like a busy, young crowd.  I went at 3:30pm on Sunday and went back again at 11:30pm Sunday night.  Got 1/2 off my check because it was after 11pm!

I had been looking forward to dining here for some time.  I liked the bar alot but once we sat down for dinner things didn't go so well.  I had one of the fish, I forgot which one, that came with a lemon sauce.  It was tasteless.  They were very nice and I sent it back and got the Veal Piccata.  It wasn't good at all.  The veal was more 4 thin McDonald's hamburger patties and had no flavor.  It wasn't just me, I had 3 others at the table try the dishes.  One of my guests had the Artic Char and it was nice.  The other person had a steak and it wasn't cooked properly so he sent it back at which time it came back fine.  Overall, not impressed.  I'll go back to the bar for a cocktail, I won't try the food again.
