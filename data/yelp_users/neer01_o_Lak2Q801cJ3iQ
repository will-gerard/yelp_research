Really disappointed that I paid $69 for such a crappy job. My cuticles were bleeding and they rushed me out of the chair so someone else can sit down and my nails didn't have time to dry and now are ruined. My baby shower is Saturday which is why I wanted to get my nails done and it was so expensive for my nails to be messed up. I have never been so disappointed.

I am 9 months pregnant and due any day now. I had them come out to clean my house before the baby came because I really do not have the energy. We have a 3 bedroom 2 bath condo. At the beginning they seemed very sweet and willing to help saying they love to help out and it's not about the money but about keeping their cleaners busy and making customers happy. Well last week they had one girl come out and she was here from 9:30am (which was suppose to be here at 9) until 3:15pm. So 6 hours. 2 of the rooms weren't even touched. There were multiple things on the list of general cleaning that they give you that were not completed. Once my boyfriend came home we really looked at everything and wondered what took 6 hours. We are not dirty people at all. After I paid so the cleaner could leave I called and messaged the owner saying how Unsatisfied I was. She said she completely understood and she herself would come back out to finish the job today (Tuesday june 28th) and finish the job herself at 1:30pm. Well 1:30 comes around and no word or no where to be seen. Then 2:00pm comes around still nothing. Sat at home and waited all day. Finally messaged her just asking for a refund because I was so unhappy with the service. She then replied saying no refunds and she tried to get ahold of me but all my messages seemed to disappear to let me know something had come up. Although she has my phone number as well as paperwork with my information on it. After trying to talk to her and resolve the issue she then blocked me so I could not message her anymore. My house is still not clean and baby is on her way any day.
