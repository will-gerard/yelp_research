Love Love this place! The jewel of the valley offering very creative dishes from an extraordinary chef. An eye for a keen sense of taste and entertainment. Truly an artist in his mastery...finally someone who understands what simple pleasures can bring. Spontaneous happiness is this place! I highly recommend. My wedding rehearsal dinner will be a unique experience in his hands....can't wait for what Chef Chris has to bring:)

Medicine man....here I come! Right at the center of the Biltmore Square, True Food Kitchen is delicious, fresh and healthy. Eating clean in every bite, can't say no to a delicious tasteful and healthy meal! Girls you won't regret it, boys don't be afraid. Just what the Dr. Ordered. Nice ambiance for a great book club discussion on a Sunday for brunch. Don't miss it!

Ole! Gracias to the host for making room for my crew! This place will make you want to become a Flamenco dancer and come back for more! First glance of the place and I new I was in for a fun night full with Flamenco, Sangria, Paella and Tapas Papa Frita! Nice ambiance Spanish Style with romantic and very fitting live Flamenco entertainment. Prices were reasonable for as much or as little as wished. Your choice of Tapas topped off with a Paella for two! Walking distance to the Casablanca Lounge Outdoor patio.....European fun hopping adventure for sure!

March madness....Tilted Kilt madness! The good: Close place by the US Airways stadium with cheap BEER...The Bad: Slow service, small cold pizza, semi cold beer and girls looked tired...need to smile more! Not like I care but if you plan to be understaffed on a big night of game events....make it work!
