I have nothing but great things to say about this place! My brother introduced me over 10 years ago, I have been going ever since.  My boyfriend & I have become regulars! Not only due to the amazing quality of food! Such consistency which is quite rare to find an Italian restaurant in Arizona.  The servers, the hostess, management & owners treat customers like family.  We have worked our way through the entire menu.  My favorite for lunch is the baked Rigatony. For dinner the Penne Rosa hands down!  No matter how full I am I will ALWAYS make room for the apple bread pudding.  It's the best in Arizona!  Rigatonys is reasonably priced an excellent portions.  every meal comes with an anti-pasta salad fresh bread with olive oil and fresh seasonings for dipping.  The vibe here is just right. They also have a loyal dining membership, which leads to buy one entree get one free. Card #2 is buy one get one & a free dessert.  The card #3 is a $20 gift card.  I don't know what I like best about this place. The food or the amazing customer service!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to write a review on one of my favorite places. You won't be disappointed!

I went shopping with my mother at this location & it was beyond terrible I have zero desire to go back.  We normally shop at the Scottsdale location, now I remember why.  The customer service we awful.  By awful I mean nonexistent.  She had questions about Kat Von D & other long wear lipsticks.  Not only was the store almost completely out of product!  No one cared.  The employees lack of interest of assisting customers really left a bad taste in my mouth.  This was about 2 weeks ago.  However, I can't let it go. Word of mouth can be bad for business.  I will not be back to shop at this location.  I saw young girls trying on lipsticks straight from the sample.  #NotSanitary
