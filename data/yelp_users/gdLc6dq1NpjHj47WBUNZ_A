Ok. so on the west side, people wait for hours (every night of the week) for f*ing olive garden. Are you kidding me? Come on people, if you want crappy Italian food check out the freezer section at Fry's. No waiting!   So in that context, Babbo is really good. Cute little place in a strip wall (this is the west side after all). The food is comfort food. Nothing creative or fancy, just big portions and tasty food.   We had the salad, pesto bruschetta, pizza and the tiramisu. Everything was pretty good (not if you are on a diet...or a pseduo diet like I am).   Great service. Our waitress rocked. And she offered tasting of several wines so we could make our choice. Nice touch. It is amazing how good service can make a place shine.   Anyway, I will go back.  Nice to see a good place in the 623.

I used to love Tokyo Lobby....but lately not so much. So I was in search of a new west side (what! what!) sushi spot.  In the Fry's shopping center. Much nicer on the inside than on the outside. Pretty large inside.  Had a selection of rolls and all were really fresh. Good flavors. No sick mayo mixture (that other places use to cover up bad sushi). Small pieces (which I like).  Rolls were 4.50 to 8$ (for the "normal" rolls) and specialty rolls up to 10$.  Overall a west side win!   I will be going back.

TAMALES BITCHES....  Man this place has awesome tamales. If you eat nothing else here (and you should try all the other delicious food) eat the green and red tamales. They are really the best. You can make a meal out of the chips and tamales. You won't regret it.  This place is famliy run. The waiter (the father) is impossible to understand (just smile and nod)...but the food is unique, fresh, tasty and very reasonble.  Pretty easy to get a table. Very casual. Scary strip mall...right next to the nicest Taco Bell I have ever seen.  Try the coconut flan cake for dessert. Really good.  And check out the unique beers. I really enjoy both Quilmes and Xginu (sp?).

Contrary to the reviwers below...I love Matt's. Yeah the wait is long...the place is small...once I went in the summer and I was sweating in my coffee...  BUT....  This is Phoenix people. When the breakfast choices are a tasty meal at Circle K (heated under heat lamps) or Denny's and IHOP, you can't beat Matt's.   I love breakfast. I eat breakfast everywhere I travel on business. I have never had a better breakfast than at Matt's. Fresh ingredients, great food, excellent bread and jam...kick $ss hashbrowns.  I wish the place was bigger (and cooler) and the wait not so long. But as a special breakfast treat...you can't beat it.  Just bring your own fan.

I am a pretty big sushi fan. Living on the West Side (623...forever biatches)...my choices are really Sakana (which is ok) and Tokyo Lobby (which can be really good or a bit funky)....  I heard about YASU in PHX MAG and then Yelped it....  Have gone there twice in the last week. First time did more of a sampling menu, sushi, things from the grill etc. The second time just rolls.  Both times I was impressed. The rolls aren't large (which I actually like) and the fish is really fresh and delicious. No need for soy sauce or wasabi. The grilled duck was recommended by our server (I am no a huge duck guy) and it was pretty kick ass.  We also had a crab which was good, but the portion of crab meat for the price was a little small.   I would just skip dessert. Nothing too impressive. But the sushi is great and the menu is very unique. Cool atmosphere (dark, good music, but still casual).  I don't think I will be going back to west side sushi!

If I didn't have to bring my "gat" to dinner I would have given it 5 stars....  Food -  Had a pizza and the gnocchi. Both were very good. One of the better pizza's I have had in phoenix. Definitely fresh, loved the tomato sauce. Nice crust. Not to thin, not too thick. The gnocchi in vodka red sauce was also really good. They serve this great flat bread....it is awesome. Almost worth going just for the bread.  The Ambience -  The place is small. Not like in the "cute, warm and cozy small" way. It is f*ing small. Sort of hot and stuffy the night we went. Besides the few tables (literally like 5 in the whole place) he has done a good job with the inside, especially in the seedy location.  The location -  In a ghetto strip mall. We had to wait for a table (in my car) and there were some pretty interesting characters. Where else can you see a dude in a wife beater eating his dinner out of a country crock container while on the move to his next score.  The service -  Good. But the owner (who is really nice and seems to actually be Italian, or at least watched a lot of Italian movies to get the accent down) is the ONLY server. So it is a bit chaotic. He needs some help. But he does a great job.  Wine -  You wouldn't know they had wine because there isn't a hint of it on any menu. Maybe they are on the "DL" (down low for those less gansta than myself)....anyway, we asked and got a nice large glass of Chianti. Very good actually. Just put that shit on the menu.  Seriously, I love my drinky drink.  Overall, i will go back!  Check it out. Good stuff.

My wife and I have this running debate about what "five stars" means.    I have given places five stars in the CONTEXT on the class of restaurant (like cheap burger joint). And other times I have been too free (I am a bit of a five star slut) with my high ratings.  But folks, from the bottom of my heart, NOCA is a solid 5 star, in any class.  Best restaurant in PHX, period. Six star if I could do it.  I almost dinged them a bit for the hostess taking a while to come to the front of the restaurant to great us and for the slightly slow waitress.  But the food is ridiculously good.   I could have sat and served myself.  To be clear, I don't mean - "Large quantities" or "Cheap" when I say good.  I mean fine crafted food. Layered flavors. Things your tongue didn't knew existed. Balance. Food nirvana...   Worth every penny. I can't wait to go back.  Thank God for NOCA!

My first visit was last week. Good food and good prices. Had the burger and the wife had a sub. Both were very good. Good fries and rings as well.   If you order a "combo" you will get a HUGE basket of fries. Even my family (who loves to eat fries!) could share one order between two of us.  The interior needs a bit of TLC but these guys are just starting out and they are independent (which you have to love in our chain saturated restaurant).  The location is a bit ghetto but you don't need to pack heat. You do leave smelling like grease...so bring an extra shirt. :)  I really liked the huge selection of unique soda. The kids loved it too.  This was a really cool touch.  The owners are really friendly and nice and you just feel good supporting a local business. We need more restaurants like Rocket Burgers.  Keep up the good work guys!

Very solid place. Cool ambience (casual but cool). The bar area is especially nice looking. They are working out the kinks with the air conditioning, we froze at our table. As an aside - what is the deal with every place in PHX freezing us out all year. Come on folks, pick a comfortable temperature. Not all of us are sweating in the kitchen.  Ok, back to BT.  A few miscues (ordered biscuits that never showed, bread given to us after our main course)...but (and this is key) the waiter was awesome and took full responsibility for the mix ups (as opposed to the typical blame game).    The food we did get was really good. I had the spare rib. Was excellent. - like a delicious pot roast. Wife had the mussels. Really good as well. Excellent grits and salad (the butter lettuce). Had the smores (unique) and the pecan pie (awesome!).  Try to 5$ red wine (the house). Was really good (and I am a bit of a wine snob).   Total close to 100$ (but we had drinks, appetizers, two deserts etc).

As a local and a frequent traveler, I am really excited about the transformation happening in Sky Harbor terminal four. Local restaurants like Matt's Big Breakfast, Chelsea's Kitchen, Delux and others are replacing Burger King and your typical airport fare.  I don' think Four Peaks has gotten the memo that airport food can be good.  On my way to my gate this morning I decided to give Four Peaks a try. I ordered a coffee (a bit lukewarm- but ok) and the Brewers Breakfast. I am not sure if I read the menu incorrectly but it said "eggs". I ordered eggs over easy and was given what tasted like powdered scrambled eggs.    If the only option was scrambled - the waitress should have said that when I ordered them fried.  So I have had powered eggs before and I can handle it. But the breakfast potatoes were really bad. The best way to describe them was waterlogged. I rarely don't finish my plate, even at the most mediocre restaurant - but one bite was enough.  Even the toast was pretty lame.  How can you make toast lame?  Not a great way to start the morning. Should have just had a coffee at Pete's or Starbucks.  I am sure the beer is good - but they need to give the food some serious attention.
