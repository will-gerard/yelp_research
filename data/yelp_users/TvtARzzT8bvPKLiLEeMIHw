Great grub spot for before a game.  The sports crowd is obviously their bread and butter so they are mindful of taking your order, getting you your food and check quickly so that you're not late.  We tried the BBQ and it was pretty good for a generalist kind of place.  The menu is quite extensive so it's sure to have something for everyone.

I came here with a friend for Happy Hour and I must say I was impressed with the food.  We had a hot pot, soba with tempura and a couple of rolls.  All were very good.  The soba stood out as "I must come back for this!"  I think the only miss was that the waitress didn't check in on us to see if we would have liked another drink before happy hour ended.  Parking can be kind of tight so I'd get here early if you can.

Their fresh fruit cakes are a must for special occasions or a unique treat for dinner party guests. Great local business with excellent customer service! Highly recommend!

The food at this place is top notch!  "Nancy's favorite sandwich" is also Suzanne's :).  I think the drinks are a little overpriced and the service at times isn't the fastest...but if your looking for a great baked goods with quality ingredients stop at this place.

Yay!!!! I've finally found a decent Vietnamese restaurant in North Scottsdale.  I had the PHO (customized the way I like it) and a sandwich.  Both were really good!  Very reasonably price and the service couldn't be faster.  I just wish they had a bigger menu but they have the basics so I will be back for sure!

So we are kind of obsessed with this place and apparently so is the rest of Mesa.  There is always a line out the door.. I think the only time to come and not wait that long would be 4-5 on a early week night.  They welcome you with a basket of warm, soft rolls.  I've had the smaller steak and ribs.  My fiance really likes their blooming onion.  The caesar salad was also very good and I consider myself a connoisseur.  We've always had outstanding service here and think it is quite affordable for a steak house.

We'll let me start off my saying the table we were seated at looked dirty.  The sushi itself was pretty good..we ordered a dragon roll, spicy tuna and cali... I also got the mackerel which was nothing special and my fianc√© ordered their ramen which was a total joke...straight out of a package with no toppings not at all tradition Japanese ramen.

I actually have buyer's remorse even several days after eating here.  High prices for not a lot of food.  We both were hungry about an hour after eating here for dinner.  No bread before our entrees..me and my fiance were staring at each other starving, waiting for our food.  We would have ordered a Cesar Salad..but they didn't have one on the menu (I thought that is standard steakhouse fare).  Our waitress was somewhat of an apparition.  We asked for horseradish to go with the primerib and she asked a follow up question and then never came back with it.  We couldn't even flag her down to ask for it again...although randomly without a word she would bring drink refills even though we didn't need or ask for them yet?!?  I didn't feel the loaded bake potato had enough topping...so I guess it wasn't that loaded after all.  Overall disappointing.

I had to search high and low for a dry cleaner in the surrounding area.  This was my first visit and it looks like they did a good job with a decent turn around time.  I thought the prices were reasonable so I will be back.

So I've been to this business now about 3 additional times since my initial review and I have to say the older gentleman that works there is very, very rude.  I had a BRAND new men's shirt laundered my last visit (entirely b/c I didn't want to iron it) and it came back with a blood!?! stain on the cuff.  I pointed this out to him and he very rudely brushed it off as our fault, even though I explained to him that it's brand new and I took the tags off in there business b/f sending it off to be cleaned. I won't be returning to this business which is a shame b/c it's the closest to my house and I dry clean quite often.  I gave it 2 stars b/c the older lady that works there is nice but I seem to have to deal with the gentleman for my pick ups.

What could be worse then the wait at the DMV?  Marry it with the experience of buying a used car and you have THIS Verizon store.  Changing my phone plan was nothing less then torture.  I waited for what seemed like an eternity on a weeknight at about 4pm.  Then when I finally get a customer service rep he kept running to the back "to talk to his manager" about different plans he could offer me and kept trying to get me to buy things I didn't want or need.  He told me I was "boring" for not wanting a tablet....excuse you?!?  And that I should pay for my husbands cell phone plan too...here's a tip for you buddy.. mind you're own F*ing business!  I know this is going to shock you, but after all was said and done, the cell phone plan he set me up with was still wrong.  I called customer service the next day, got an awesome representative that took care of everything in less then 10 minutes.  Moral of the story, avoid going into the store at all costs and call Verizon directly if you can.

Having lived in Hawaii I can say the food and atmosphere are legit.  Definitely not a chain place..and they have a lot more on the menu the other Hawaiian BBQs such as malasadas and poke.  We really liked the Katsu, Kailua Pork and Kalbi plate lunches with all fixings.  We've already been back within the same week after our initial visit.  Solid local grinds..can't wait to check out the luau.

This is a pretty good brunch spot in a really random area.  You'd never know a restaurant was here unless you knew about it already or found it on yelp..lol.  I like to get the garden omelette and add meat to it.  Their pancake is decent..nothing about it really sticks out.  My significant other always orders the chicken fried steak with gravy.  I've had a couple of savory bites and it is quite tasty.  We always seems to have leftover for breakfast the next day.  Service is generally pretty good although there can be a bit of a wait after 9am.  I like that they leave a pitcher of coffee and water with you so you aren't waiting for a refill.

We had a groupon to try the breakfast and overall we were impressed.  They gave good size, flavorful portions and the service was friendly.  The cook even came out to ask if we enjoyed our meal.   The restaurant itself was clean and well taken care of.  Next time I'm going to try the menudo or one of their seafood dishes.  Since they are serving breakfast, they may want to add coffee to the menu :)

All and All it is a very good breakfast and lunch spot.  Simple and no frills, just fresh ingredients.  Normally I love their bloody mary but this last visit was a little off, I hope they haven't changed their recipe.  I would recommend you get there EARLY because I line tends to form rather quickly.

The outside of their business looks a little shabby but I guess never judge a book by it's cover.  I thought these guys did an excellent job at a better price then a place up the street.  I had them dry clean 2 dresses and a suit..turn around was 2 days and everything looked top knotch.  The attendant was very friendly and even took the time to say they found a pocket square and placed it in a little bag.  They also gave me a longer fold over bag for my maxi dress.   Will be back for sure!

If you are looking for a sushi happy hour in North Scottsdale as Brigham Young would say: "This is the place".  Although, I don't think he would have a half price cocktail like me :).  Ra has a nice large patio to relax and nosh on some rolls.  If rolls aren't your thang then I would recc the pineapple cheese wonton's and seaweed salad.  I also like their tootie, veggie and dragon rolls.  Wide selection of items on happy hour, great service..winner, winner sushi dinner!

My friend would like to compliment this Discount Tire for caring for her red thunderbird while she was in the hospital.  She had been in the hospital since November and they had cared for the car each night until she was able to collect it.  We highly recommend that people use this establishment.

A vendor two doors down suggested I try this spot for lunch.  A nice, little local establishment. I got the pepper turkey sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup.  Portions were a good size and it came with a homemade cookie.  The price was on point.  The rest of their baked goods looked awesome.  A little bit of a wait for a soup and sandwich and it's cash only but if I'm in the area, I would definitely stop by again.

What a great local place!  I feel like Norm from Cheers every time I walk in the door (which is only 1x every 2 weeks or so).  The staff really makes an effort to get to know their customers by name.  The sandwiches are fresh and made to order with lots of veggies.  Their soups are unique and flavorful.  My favorites are italian stew and shepard's pie.  I like the nine grain bread but the chilly cheese is also yummy.  The portions are  gi-normous.  I usually get HALF a sandwich and soup/salad...this lasts me 2 meals.   I'm pretty sure once you try it you'll never look at Subway the same again.

I've heard about this place for a while..decided to check it out..very good and a nice variety of different Asian foods..we had the hot and sour soup, shrimp curry and the mixed bag of a little of everything..very good and big portions..plenty of leftovers.  If you're in the mood for Peking duck you need to order it a day in advance and the yelp discount for check ins doesn't work anymore.

Worst service..no water provided..because who really needs that in Az? No one checked on me after my food arrived and they forgot my to go cup of Tea.  Fo-riz..its 3:30pm not like they were busy or anything.  Go to the Shea or Chandler location...so much better! I'll never come back to this one.

I've been to at least 5 of the Spring Training parks in the Phoenix area and this one is a crowd pleaser.  They did a great job directing traffic/parking..not a bottleneck to get in or out.  Lots of room to set up for tailgates.  All of the staff we interacted with were helpful and friendly.  The stadium has a nice layout and there really isn't a bad seat in the park.  I also like that they have a wide variety of ballpark food and lots of different areas to buy souvenirs unlike other places were it's only 1 pro shop which has a line just to get in.  I guess the only con is that it's in Mesa so there really isn't any place to go out to after the game (unlike the actual Wrigley Field).

Wow! This place is really, no really really good..I wanted to take another plate home with me but refrained (since I was with a group).  I has the enchilada dinner and it was plate licking good..I ate everything..even the beans which my boyfriend reminded that I don't like beans.  The salsa verde I could drink by the gallon and the margarita packed a punch without tasting overwhelmingly like tequila...I will be dreaming about this place until I can go back...Saturday afternoon...no wait/line...great service too!

We went with a large group (about 20) for happy hour.  The food was decent and reasonably priced but a lot of the people in our group complained that the waitstaff AND management were rude to them.  It was bad enough that some of them refused to get a drink there and headed over to Chili's.  Another thing to note is that the happy hour space is limited in the patio area, even though we were there around 4pm and no one was occupying the "dining area" tables, they refused to let our party sit in any tables not designated as the bar area.  I guess my whole thing is don't tout your happy hour and have it last all night if you don't appear to like/welcome happy hour customers...

Very good/cheap Vietnamese sandwiches..I wouldn't call it fast food...more like painfully slow...I think there is one guy preparing all the food :-/...it's cash only but I'd advise not to use their ATM..it only gave me $20 but debted me $60...when I asked the guy who I saw refilling the machine he waived me off and told me to go to the cashier..I was ready to call the cops!

We just had a fabulous meal at The Green House for Az Restaurant Week.  We started off with the warm Brie served with tart cherries, crusty bread, roasted garlic and nuts...delicious! The green house signature salad was also amazing and light with pistachios and avocado.  My main course was the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon..OMG! Perfectly cooked, tender pork (which is impossible for me to do at home). This was served with horseradish potatoes..delish! I was stuffed but I couldn't stop eating. For dessert we had the pineapple upside cake..nice crunchy texture on the bottom...wonderful sauce that wasn't too sweet.  All and all it was a great meal. I would recommend making a reservation as the last time I came I saw a lot of people not being able to be seated right away without one with a lengthy wait.  Excellent service..the manager even stopped by to see how we enjoyed our meal.

I was pleasantly surprised with the Shark Reef Aquarium.  I would say I've been to quite a few Aquarium's around the country and this one is one of the best that I've visited.  I really like the theme they chose..it looked authentic and not hokey...it reminded me of a lost city in the Amazon.  They had the largest octopus I've ever seen at an Aquarium!  All of their sea animals were out to play..not hiding in a corner.  The jellyfish tank was super cool as was the Komodo dragon (never seen one of those in person before!).  The line got pretty long early in the day but they are open till 8pm so maybe later afternoon would be a better time to visit?

We went to a wedding open house @ Sassi and we were both very impressed..and quite frankly sold that this is where we wanted to have our wedding.  I met the wedding planner, Bernadette and her assistant and they said they would give me an estimate within the next couple of days.  They did send me an initial estimate in a timely manner HOWEVER it was for the wrong time of year and for the wrong amount of people.  I emailed her back that night thanking her for the estimate but to please send a revised estimate for the correct date and amount of people.  Fast forward to a week later, I get a one line response from Bernadette's ipone stating "the price would be the same"..ok maybe for the different date, but I highly doubt the price would be the same for 25 additional people.  So I again, asked her for a revised estimate for 25 additional people...two weeks later...still no response.  I've now shifted gears and am working with a wedding planner in Paris..who responds to my emails either that day or the next day.  I'm baffled that someone from across the world delivers better customer service then a place a couple miles away.  Considering this is a tens of thousands of dollar purchase.. I guess Sassi doesn't want our business. :-/

I would say I'm in love with their menu but the service...while good..was painfully slow and the restaurant wasn't that busy..I guess on his defense he was the only server on a Sunday afternoon.  They kind of have late hours on the weekends for earlybirds like us.  Will comeback for the soup and gyro platter...desserts were also excellent!

One cashier to service the brunch crowd...what an efficient idea..now we know why the line was a mile long..meanwhile 3 hostesses were standing around waiting to seat people and some manager was running around answering phones  the food was average for a Vegas buffet..nothing sticks out as memorable...we never saw our waitress after she delivered our drinks..if you want an amazing buffet experience go to the Wynn.

I've been to this spot a couple of times.  I have to say on this visit (at around 4pm on a Sunday) there were a lot of empty containers some I'm guessing all 64 were not represented.  I had the turtle and peanut butter in a homemade waffle cone...delish!  Service has always been friendly and helpful and this was the case today as well.  If I'm in the area, I would definitely stop by again, even though there weren't 64 flavors, there was enough of a variety for me to find something that I liked.

Ok, let me just start by saying, I've been to Tokyo, lived in Honolulu and I think this is one of the better, more authentic Japanese restaurants in the valley.  If I lived/worked closer I would be at Sushi Ken weekly.  In the summer, nothing compares to their cold ramen.  It is so hard to find decent ramen in Phoenix!  For lunch, you don't get more bang for your buck then their bento and lunch specials.

This place is AMAZING.  I really, truly love their pancakes...they are little, golden and crispy.  The selections on the menu can be a bit overwhelming... I really like their lox and bagel combo (with a side of pancakes of course!).  The coffee is served with real cream and the service is always excellent.  The wait can be a bit much..a kin to say the DMV...so we try and get there either really early or really late...

I bought the Weekly Plus deal for carpet cleaning.  At the time of the appt. they called to say they were running late, ok..not a huge deal, I appreciated the phone call.  My place is pretty spotless and I moved all of the furniture out of the way for them.. I just needed high foot traffic areas shampooed.  The owner of the company was the one who cleaned my carpets.  He noticed I had an area that could use a carpet repair and recommended their service.  I accepted their rate and set up an appointment for the following week.  A half an hour before the scheduled appointment he cancelled and said he would call back to reschedule (never did).  Flash forward a couple of weeks, I called him to reschedule and he said he will get back to me later that night..flash forward a couple of days no returned phone call...wow (and not in a good way).  I would give their carpet cleaning a B..I would give their customer service an F...don't I feel like a moron for tipping them on their first visit.

I don't normally eat Chinese food..but when I do, it's usually Panda Express...although I think I may drive out of my way to go here more often.  The food was amazing!  We had the seafood chow fun and mapo tofu.  Both were excellent and the portions were gi-normous.  Have I mentioned cheap yet?  The only con is that we had to wait a REALLY long time to get our food.. so bring some friends to chat with while you're waiting for the goodness.

Came here for Happy Hour and sat at the bar.  My friend recc a Basil/gratefruit/vodka cocktail that was so refreshing...before I knew it I had 3.  We had the heirloom tomato/pulled mozzarella salad and warm goat cheese with bruschetta.  All of the food was high quality, fresh and delicious!  Angel was a friendly and attentive bartender.  The only miss for me was that one of the bathroom's (1 out of 2) wasn't working..so a long line for the bathroom.. I'm also not a fan of the unisex bathroom.

The food here is exceptionally good.  We usually go for a combo platter although this last time I got the chicken gallaya.  Large portions at a reasonable price.  We always seem to have leftovers for lunch the next day.  Make sure to bring extra mints because you will smell like vampire repellent from all the garlic :)  The decor is lacking to say the least...

Normally I'm an very leary of chain anything but since my insurance gave me no choice and I managed to get an appointment same day I decided to give this place a whirl.  The staff was very friendly and efficient.  I was very impressed with the Optometrist .  She was personable and did a thorough examination.  Always good not to feel like cattle!  I would definitely recommend this place and plan on going back for my annual exams.

So, I do love this place.  I can't seem to branch away from the fried zukes and Fontina burger (the pecan pesto is to die for)  but once and a while I will be swayed into getting the BBQ chicken pizza or the thai chicken salad.  My only gripes are that sometimes the line is ridiculously long..so go on off peak meal hours and whenever I go there for dinner children are always running around like a bunch of wild banshees (maybe their parents tricked them into thinking this was a chucky cheese)..

I thought this Sweet Tomatoes was brand new when I walked it.  Very Clean and everyone was friendly and attentive.  The staff at this location are a class act!    The salad bar and it's topping were well maintained and fresh.  I especially liked their array of pasta salads.  The Tarragon and Tuna and the Asian Peanut were my favorites!  I am a soup lover and could spend my entire meal there alone.  I got a second ok a third helping of the Spicy Sausage with Pasta and beans.  Pizza was good as was the hot pasta selection.  I definitely plan on coming back here again and again...even though it's not the closest Sweet Tomatoes to me it is by far the best I've been to in the Valley...kudos!!!

If you have a hankering for a decadent cupcake then there is no finer place then Sprinkles!  I also like to get them as a treat when I'm going to a dinner party or for someone's birthday.  This last visit, I was in for just one and I only realized after I stood in like that there was a cupcake ATM...I could have gotten through a lot faster if I had just used that.  They have perfected the red velvet..nobody makes one like they do.  I also like the strawberry and peanut butter.  I'm only praying that they open a sprinkles ice cream soon..maybe next door?

I appreciated how accommodating he was and that the restaurant lets you make substitutions with side dishes.  I would definitely go back.

This place reminds me of a truck stop on a road trip up North. Friendly service, ginormous portions.  Probably the biggest biscuit I've ever seen in my life.  I had the chicken sausage scramble which was good and filling..since I chose something on the "light" menu I wish they hadn't buttered my toast in advance. I had a taste of the chicken fried steak and it was good but there is no way on God's green earth that I'd ever be able to finish that meal.

I've only been to this location for happy hour but both times I've gone everyone really enjoyed themselves.  I'm a fan of their gyoza, vegas roll, and crunchy tuna roll.  I usually get a mojito or their ice tea with fresh mint.  The last time I was there, I had a slight issue with my drink and the manager came out right away an addressed the issue.

This place gets a lot of hype and rightly so.  They have 1 of a kind artesian flavors you won't find anywhere else.  Everything is made in the store with fresh, natural ingredients.  I usually go for the cookies with milk, huckleberry or horchata.  I actually really like their homemade cookies (walnuts, oatmeal, melted chocolate).  Lots of my out of town guests enjoy visiting this place.  I just wish it was a little cheaper so I could enjoy it more often.

I've taken the Zumba, Ballet Barre, Pilates and Belly Dancing.  So far I am very impressed!  All of their instructors are top notch.  The classes are small (e.g. 6 people in a pilates class vs. 20 at my gym).  Because the class sizes are smaller then a gym the instructors actually have time to help you with your form and show you how to do moves properly.  All of the employees are friendly and the online scheduling system makes it easy to reserve a spot in a class.  If they also had spinning then I would give up my gym membership entirely.  Highly Recommend!

This place is off the chain!  Everytime I go, I want to go back the next day.  I don't even like beans, but I like their beans.  I've gotten the combo platter and it usually lasts me 2 meals.  Very reasonably priced.  Great service!  Very clean.  If you're looking for Latin food outside the box, check this place out :)

This place is nestled in a little corner of a strip mall.   I would have never found this place if I hadn't saw a post on Instagram.  When I walked inside I was surprised to see it was packed..with a wait list for tables.  Me and a friend got seated pretty quickly.  Normally I'm a pho girl but I saw a post for the bun bo hue which peaked my interest as I'm a spicy, lemongrass lover.  It was delicious!  I was a little scared of the spice level...so I went with a 2 out of a 5 (which I thought would be a medium)  but I tried my friend's spicy broth and realized I could have handled a 4.  Their eggrolls and thai ice tea were spot on.  Service was fast and friendly.  I can see why people like this place...and would go back fo sho.

I think I've found my regular brunch spot. Great portions, amazing food and drinks.. the only bummer is there can sometimes be a wait so you may want to get their early.  I recommend the strawberries and chocolate pancakes or the Cream Brulee Waffles and don't forget the Bloody Mary's!

I was looking for a Zumba class in the area and Selene's at Freestone Rec Center was the answer to my prayers!  Literally, after the first couple of songs I wanted to cry tears of joy...I felt like I found the lost Dutchman's treasure :).  So Selene's class gets 5 stars...especially if you are like me and like taking Zumba classes that are high energy, play mostly if not all latin music, and do latin dance moves (watered down Zumba = no bueno).  For the most part I think it is a really nice facility with a wide variety of activities.  I took a star off because the bathroom/locker rooms are in desperate need of a remodel.

Well I must disclaim that I lived in Chicago so I have high standards for Chicago style food.  This place was basically, all around ok but nothing I would go out of my way for.  It's a standard, typical, American fare restaurant.  My boyfriend was under the impression that since this is a "Chicago restaurant" that his pizza would be deep dish (and it wasn't, so he was disappointed).  The service was ok as well, although they kind of gave me a hard time when I presented them with my yelp check in deal stating they had never heard of it but would give me the discount anyway (why don't you look at my phone so I can show you the deal?)  If you are craving truly authentic, Chicago style food, go elsewhere (ahem..looking at some of my other reviews).

My neighbor told me about this place and I am so glad she did!  You can tell this is a dog lover owned business :)  What I like best is that they are cage free so I can drop him off before work and pick him up after and I know he won't be stuck in a crate all day.  They do a great grooming job and are reasonably priced.  Easy to get into, flexible with drop off, highly recommended!

Very quaint coffee shop in downtown Gilbert..that looks like it belongs in a college town.  Lots of outdoor seating to relax after a bike ride.  I had a Nutella latte..which was quite nice.  Will definitely be back again.

I eat my fair share of indian food and I gotta say..this is probably one of the best. Their masala has a smokey flavor to it that is amazing!  Good selection of indian beers and a nice happy hour menu.  Customer service was excellent.  We will definitely go back.

I don't ever  need to go to Pat's or Geno's in Philly.. I think the best cheese steak is at this joint in North Scottsdale.  I get mine with the wiz and it is finger licking good.  No soggy fries here either..they must double fry them b/c they are golden and crispy.  I've also had cheese pizza by the slice and would go back just for that too.

We've FINALLY found a go-to sushi place in our area...praise the Lawd! Great happy hour specials...that actually last till a decent hour.  I feel like we order a ton and it doesn't break the bank.  My husband thinks they have the best tempura..I'm also a fan of the red dragon roll. Plus free appetizer salad, miso soup and refreshing fruit dessert...will make this a weekly habit :)

I was given a gift card for this place and finally decided to check it out.  I was very excited to see that they had Nutella as one of the flavors.  Well, it was brown, cold and has the consistency of ice cream but the flavor was definitely lacking-to non existent.  I know it's less calories but geez, I think I'll do some extra pushups and have some Golden Spoon instead.  I ended up throwing the majority of it out.. my dog's ice cream probably tastes better.     Update: ~Wow "Johnathan", pretty hostile comments of my review.. I'm entitled to my opinion and review of your place..that is what YELP is all about...I am by far the best word-of-mouth- person you will ever come across...so I will be sure to share with everyone I come into contact with what a weirdo, cyber bully you are, and to stay clear from this establishment.

This is our go-to spot in the area for Mexican food.  I love their chips and trio of salsas..especially the verde and pico.  We generally get the cheese enchilada combo.  Very good rice and beans to compliment.  I've also had their shrimp dish and chile relleno.  The tortilla soup is also one of my favorites.  I feel like someone's little Abuela is making all the food in the back.  Enrique is the BEST server in the history of servers (did I mention I used to wait tables? Yep..he is even better then me in my hey day).

Hidden in the corner of a strip mall with an extremely busy parking lot..this place is no frills.  I was a little worried that if the parking lot were that full it might be a long wait but I got seated pretty quickly.  Service seems to be family style with everyone pitching in a long the way. I ordered the oxtail pho..b/c I've never seen that on a menu before and I love oxtail.  It was very good! Oxtail wasn't quite falling off the bone but definitely tender and they gave a generous portion.  I would definitely come back here again.

It looks like everyone has had a similar experience.  I've been at the same address for 6 years and never had a package stolen or lost until Haute Look decided to use OnTrac.  One and only time I will allow that to happen.  When I called customer service they acted like it wasn't a big deal that my package was lost/stolen, they told me to call Haute Look to send a replacement.  Well Haute Look can't do that because the inventory is always different each day.  Once it is sold out it's gone.  I don't want my money back..I want my Orla Kiely Dress at 60% off!!!  I'm going to file a complaint with the BBB.

Fast Service! Which is especially appreciated when I'm on my lunch hour.  I always order the PHO and it's pretty good here..portions are a little smaller then what I'm used to but it does the job so we will keep it on the rotation.

Every feel like grabbing an Omelet but don't want to wait in a huge line at a brunch spot?  Well have I got the place for you (on Sundays..although I wish it was offered every day :)!  Best made to order Omelet in town..complete with to die for cheesy potatoes!  This is a really nice LOCALLY owned coffee shop!  Very cozy and welcoming ambiance with lots of seating.  Plenty of room to stretch your legs and hang out.  The staff has always been very friendly to me and my pup.  I also like their variety of ice teas and their specialty coffee drink are pretty good too!

Saw the Groupon for Lebanese food and thought we'd check it out.  We had the lamb kabobs, falafel and a salad.  Everything tasted very good and the portions were huge.  Me and my friend couldn't get enough of the pickled beets!  The service was friendly, a couple of people came out to see how we were enjoying our meal.  I would definitely stop by again!

I bought the living social deal for grooming.  I got an appointment in a reasonable amount of time and on the day that I wanted.  They did a decent job with his cut and were done early (you get an A+ for that!).  Their regular price for grooming seems to be reasonable so I see no reason why I wouldn't go back.

As someone in our group put it: "This is the best thing I've ever been to in my 10 years in PHX".  This is the festival to eclipse all other foodie festivals!  I guess my favorite part was getting a chance to sample all of these different restaurants that I've read about/heard about but not been to yet and seeing where I want to go to for more than just a taste.  The standouts for me were: Crudo, Phoenix Public Market, J&G, Phoenix, City Grill, Barrio Queen, Kai... ok really I could go on and on.  I think the beauty of this is that because no money is exchanged and there is really only 1-3 things to take, the lines goes by very quickly.  I would suggest pacing yourself..this is a marathon of gluttony..not a sprint.. you will feel a level of fullness that far surpasses Thanksgiving dinner.  Get your tix early.. I think it sells out within a week..and wear something not confining.. I would suggest a muumuu.

Exceptional, gourmet burger.  I had the "zin burger", truffle fries, and nutella milkshake (for dessert).  Everything was fresh and decadent.  The decor is akin to farmer/modern/minimalist.  We had a great server, who was fast and friendly.  The only miss for me was my cocktail.  I order their pomegranate moscow mule and really all I could taste was the ginger beer.  So next time I'll just stick to a diet coke :)

OMG Amazing!!! Don't you want to kick yourself when you've lived somewhere for a while and JUST find amazing eats that apparently everyone else knows about?  Everything was Awesome! We had the zukes, bread, salad (sorry Olive Garden you've been topped), lasagna, baked rigatoni, and pork tenderloin.  Portions are gi-normous..thank you for my dinner the following night!

I would say as far as Casino buffets in Az go..this one is the best and closest to Las Vegas quantity and quality.   Very reasonably priced for the assortment of food.  They had a lot of different ethnic fare and a wide variety of high quality desserts.  We both thought the prime rib was excellent as well as the salads and fresh seafood.  There can be a bit of a line.. the last time we visited was on a Sunday at around 6pm and I think we waited 45 minutes to be seated.

I always take out if town foodies here and it never disappoints! Come early (before 6pm) and don't bring too big of a party! Fresh, well prepared seafood, big potions, the bread comes out warm and is good for soaking up the goodness!

More like...Chez Yummy!  What a quaint place.  Having been to Paris I had high expectations and Chez Vous didn't disappoint.  We tried the Chez Vous Crepe, one of the sandwiches, the Nutella crepe and creme brulee.  Everything was authentically delicious!  They even had Orangina and outdoor tables.  I really did feel like I was at a french cafe watching the world go by.  Service was friendly and excellent.. definitely worth checking out!

No joke..this is the name of a dry cleaning business in Scottsdale..coincidence? I think not.  I had them launder some clothes for me..nothing that really needed to be dry cleaned..just stuff I didn't want to iron personally..well I guess they didn't want to iron it either...thanks for the wrinkly sleeves and ruffles that don't lay flat...and my clothes smelled kind of funky..like when you forget about a load and leave them to sit in the washing machine...glad I basically paid for nothing.. I'd rather pay more and have it done right.

I just got a letter in the mail telling me that Moutainside is changing the terms of our contract and is now going to start charge me a "annual enhancement fee of $25 for your individual plan".  So lemme get this straight.. I'm being penalized for being single?  Yeah, there's this guy named Uncle Sam who already screws me over for being single and having a good job...I don't need my gym doing that too.  Especially when there is Abby Bella Dance Studio an LA Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness close by (I'll give you their addresses if you're interested in not being taken advantage of).  Seriously..the Audacity and what's an enhancement fee anyway?  Unless liposuction is now included in my membership, I'm taking my business elsewhere. ***Update: Mountainside management's definition of an "enhancement fee" is a joke.  I'm going to file that explanation under NOT MY PROBLEM.  What you consider "enhancements" that you want to charge me a surplus for (without my consent) most of the general public would consider operation costs and keeping up with competition.  This isn't a condo association.  I don't have any invested stake or profit sharing with this company and therefore Mountainside shouldn't be allowed to charge what I would consider to be a B*S* special assessment.  Further stating this fee is an "industry standard" is a farce.  In the past I have been a member at: 24hr Fitness, LA Fitness, XSport, Abby Bella and Bally's...NONE of these gyms have ever tried to sneak in some annual "enhancement fee" ever.. so who are you comparing yourself too?  Lastly, since I've been bashing you all over town I just found out my co-worker who also has a membership at your club isn't getting charged this annual enhancement fee...how fair is that?

This foodie thinks it's well worth the drive from North Scottsdale to Downtown Chandler for a refreshing paletas.  All their flavors are unique but my favorites would have to be the Key Lime Pie, Mexican Hot Chocolate and Strawberry Cream.  My dog was also in frozen treat heaven, he ate the chicken flavored puppy paleta so fast I was afraid he'd get brain freeze!  A local business definitely worth checking out!

Hard to believe employees can be chipper at 5:30am..but that is the case with Blue Sky Airport Parking.  This was my first park-n-jet experience out of Phoenix and I would definitely use them again, no question.  These people know what customer service is all about.  My flight home I had an unexpected delayed layover so when I finally landed all I wanted to do was go home.. absolutely no waiting for the shuttle...and I didn't even have to call them to come pick me up..they were just magically there at their little blue sign. A+++

Overall pretty good dim sum..we came at 11am on a Saturday and were seated immediately.  Although I noticed a wait forming as we got to the end of our meal.  They had all of the usual favorites and the tea was plentiful and piping hot.

This was my first time going to FilmBar to see...well a film.  I had been here once for a quick drink but didn't quite know what to expect to see a full length movie.  Let me first preface this by saying, in no way would my appearance ever have me mistaken me for a hipster.  I asked someone who looked like they were working the front door dumb questions like: how to go about getting tickets?, is there an actual theater?...I braced myself for an eye roll but to my surprise he was very friendly and helpful...actually, everyone who worked there was..and welcoming.  We saw the documentary Amy..and I really liked the vibe for an independent film.. I also liked being able to enjoy an adult beverage with the show.  I plan on coming back again to get my indie film fix.  Thanks FilmBar!

They have a large patio which is always welcome in Phoenix.  The food and drinks were decent but PRICE-Y.  I had 1 cocktail, a salad and my bill was around $30.00 (without tip).  Our waitress was rude and not very welcoming...we had a big table so she wouldn't split checks because they were "too busy" at that time of day...maybe that was her way of letting us know she was going to do automatic gratuity...which usually I'm cool with but if the service sux.....anyway..I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.  Oh and the happy hour ends REALLY early..like 5pm..don't complain about it because they get really defensive!

Monster size, made to order pizza slices (their slice is about equal to 3 someplace else).  My only gripe is my mushrooms weren't really cooked so they tasted a bit dry but all the other toppings tasted good and the crust was nice and crunchy.  Great place to get your pizza fix.

John gets 1 star for coming out in a timely manner.  He gets 0 stars for initially misdiagnosing the problem, charging me $85 for it to work for 10 minutes, then coming back out and telling me it's actually a $550 problem.  I asked my friend's husband who is in AC for a second opinion and he said they charge $420 for the same problem.  When we asked about his price he ran off in a huff and left us with an even more broken air conditioner.  Thanks for nothing!

This place is an all around winner in my book.  The food is fresh and delicious!  I've had the tacos, beach house burger and the pulled cabbage sandwich.  I'm a carnivore at heart but I think the cabbage is my new favorite!  They have different choices of bread that include 9 grain if you're trying to keep things on the healthy side.  I think I need to hit this place up weekly.

It's been a while since I've been to Stingray.  Today I came with my friend who is a vegetarian, which at most restaurants isn't an issue.  We ordered our drinks and then asked the waitress what on the menu was vegetarian.. SHE DIDN'T KNOW.. seriously? Did you just start working here today?  She then went to the kitchen and came back saying the chef said NOTHING on the menu is vegetarian.  I find that completely ridiculous, for any restaurant, let alone a Japanese restaurant in Scottsdale.  It's not like we went to a steakhouse in East Texas.  So we basically cancelled our drink order and left.  Thanks but no thanks.

I feel like when I'm in a pinch, YELP really comes through for me.  I was looking to switch accountants for my tax prep this year.  I initially asked a bunch of friends and colleagues but was not sold on any one that they suggested (mostly b/c the rates would have been as much as my State return).  I found Sapphire after requested quotes on YELP.  Jonathan was very timely with email correspondence and I was able to schedule an appointment within a couple of days *in the last week in March! I could tell immediately I was going to like this business when they presented me with an invoice of the work they would do and the fees upfront.  I can't tell you how many times I've asked an accountant what the rate would be...I get one number and then after the work is done..I'm shell shocked with a bill that is twice as much if not more.   Cindy did my tax prep.  She was very personable and knowledgeable.  If she didn't have an immediate answer to my question, she knew where to find it and did so in a timely manner.  I have to say, this was probably the easiest and smoothest experience I've ever had with an accountant.  Highly, highly, highly recommend!

Since I've been seeing signs claiming that Capriotti's was voted "the world's greatest sandwich" I decided to give it a try.  I decided to order an Italian sandwich.  First of all, I was a little sticker shocked...they don't have a combo meal so a medium sandwich, drink and chips came out to about $12.00--yowzers!  Secondly, I was the only customer for a good 10 minutes (it was 5pm on a Thursday) and my sandwich took FOREVER to get done.. maybe I'm use to Jimmy Johns and Subway.  I got mine to go and was very disappointed to find out when I got home that they gave me the WRONG sandwich.  How do you f-up an order when it's the only customer in the restaurant?  I even double checked my receipt to make sure I ordered the one I wanted.  Instead of an Italian I got some leftover Thanksgiving ensemble.  Well, this Yelper only eats stuffing on Thanksgiving and doesn't eat cranberry sauce or mayo at all.. I was so irate I gave the entire thing to my dog..hopefully he won't get sick.

Calling this place a cafe is a stretch..there are about 4 things on the breakfast menu with really no substitutions or healthy options..we heard the word "no" a lot. My boyfriend found a hair in his food. But we didn't bother saying anything because she wasn't thrilled to serve us in the first place. Well at least she gave him silverware.

This is by far the best froyo in the area!  All of the flavors actually taste like they have the actual ingredients in them vs. just being chemically enhanced.  We like the fresh strawberry, peanut butter and coconut.  The toppings are also fresh and good.. although I would like to see Capt. Crunch added to the rotation.  We will be back again for sure :)

I bought a groupon to try this place and I am soooo glad that I did!  I don't think I would have discovered this place otherwise.  What a quaint little mom and pop place.  We started our meal with a polish beer (recommended by our server...A+), homemade bread and borscht.  The bread was airy and light.  Beautiful presentation in a rustic looking ramekin.  I love borscht and this one did not disappoint!  Since this was our first visit, we decided to try the "surprise me pierogi platter".  It comes with bacon, grilled onions and sour cream on the side to top your pierogis.  All of the pierogis were delicious!  My favorites were the farmers cheese, cabbage and potato with cheese.     After our meal I went over to their market next door and the lady running it said I could get borscht to go at anytime without calling ahead first, (so basically you will be seeing a lot more of me).  I also noticed they had all of the Pierogis that they offer in the restaurant in the market in case you want to pick up some of your favorites to make at home.  They also offer Pel Meni.  I happen to LOVE pel meni and am excited to try theirs the next time I visit!

I've seen this place before in Tempe so I was dying to give it a try....oh no, now I have another fast food guilty pleasure :)   Me and my friend both thought the guac was amazing and couldn't stop eating it.. one of the workers even brought us extra chips free of charge and refilled our drinks (did I mention this is a fast food restaurant?).  I had the carne asada torte and it was sooo good.. I keep dreaming about it.. I'll have to go back sooner then later..like tomorrow.

I decided to stop in after getting my car washed at Costco.  They had a great lunch special: 1/2 salad, soup and drink for around $7.50.  I got my order to go and realized when I got to work that they forgot my salad dressing :-/.  The salad au natural was fresh..good quality ingredients...I'm sure it would have been even better with the dressing...I digress.   I had the Tuscan Soup and that was pretty good too.  I also appreciate friendly customer service.    Seeing as I'm trying to lose some lbs for summer and am in the area a lot.. I'm sure I will be back...next time I'll check the bag before I leave though :)

It's usually a good indicator if everyone behind the counter making your food is wearing a sari.  This is a very good, authentic indian food place.  I also like that it's a walk up counter (so you don't have to tip the waitstaff).   They have tables there but I usually get my order to go during lunch and it's always pretty fast.  I like the Dal with garlic nan or butter chicken.  It's nose running spicy but it fills me up and warms my soul..aaaaah.

Nice indoor/outdoor, industrial/rustic, bustling atmosphere.  Very friendly, welcoming staff..with fast service.  I tried the Japanese cold brew flight... A-mazing! The flavors in the flight are rotated..today was star cardomen, orange ginger and Black and Tan. I went with the blackstone scramble for brunch...just the right amount of food, fresh ingredients and a killer tortilla (I don't normally eat tortillas but this one I couldn't pass up).   If you are downtown, I would highly recommend...please build a sister location in downtown Gilbert ;-)

This is the second time I have been to this new Jimmy John's location.  I thought the first time I went there maybe they were still new and that's why my beach club was missing sprouts...not the case.  Today I ordered a beach club -unwich (hold the bread) and again no sprouts, or really much of anything.. so glad I paid $7.00 for lettuce a slice of turkey and tomatoes...my receipt says beach club...which according to the menu (and every other Jimmy John's I've been to) includes: turkey, cheese,avocado spread, sliced cucumbers, sprouts, lettuce, tomato and mayo.. eh, look at the picture and tell me what you see.  On top of that.. it was definitely not fast and no one was freakin'..more like we were all waiting around wondering when we were gonna get our overpriced, not as advertised sandwich.

So I really, really like this place and have recommended it to PHX visitors and suggested it to friends when we are downtown.  My friends seemed to really, really like it too..lol.  They have a large chalkboard with a never ending list of craft beers to choose from..and wine..on tap!  I've had the spud taco, veggie flatbread pizza and avocado salad.  I would stick to the pizza and salad.  The spud taco was a little greasy for my taste.  Nice, sized portions.  I would suggest getting here early to beat the crowds to a table.

This place is definitely good.  We've had the dosa, dal, birhiani, garlic naan and one of the lamb currys.  They need more help on the floor.  I've been here twice and I've had to flag down a server both times to order.  Since it's a mile away, I will definitely be back..I'd like to try the buffet.

I was SOOOO excited when I heard Portillo's was opening in Scottsdale...I almost had to wipe away tears of joy!  This was always one of my "go to" spots when returning to the Chicagoland area.  Best Italian Beef here or there!  I also really like their chopped salad and of course Chicago Style Hot Dog and onion rings.  Really you can't go wrong with their menu and what I like best is that it tastes EXACTLY like it does in Chicago.  Dick Portillo has quality control down to an art unlike other Chicago chains who have tried to make the transition to Phoenix (which everyone knows is the largest suburb of Chicago..lol).

Rave reviews for this local business!  Booking was easily done online, for me this included next day, (on a Sunday), with a variety of times to chose from.  The staff was professional and the office was clean and well decorated.  Nikki did a wonderful and thorough job with my oxygen facial :) My skin feels soft and radiant!

It's a really good concept but the execution in authentic flavors for each region falls a little short.  Every dish we tried was a bit off.  We had the Indian Butter Chicken, Thai Lemongrass Curry, Samosas (that was probably the best item) and some weird Korean Firecracker Riceball.  (I'm Korean and my Eomma would be like "what the truck is this?")  Kind of reminds me of Trader Joe ethnic food but if you like the real, authentic deal then this place is probably not your speed.

I'm completely in love with this place! Farm fresh ingredients, inventive flavor combination, they make healthy taste amazing! My go-tons are their Greek and caprese salads but I also love their seasonal like the kale Cesar they have going on right now.  I also like that they are open early on weekdays so you can grab a fresh, filling salad before you head to work. Wish they had the same hours on the weekends.

Great local business! The owners/workers are very friendly and personable.  You can tell they take pride in their business.  I had the traditional pho and my friend ordered vegetarian pho..we were both pleased with our meals.  Looks like a found my local pho place in the East Valley.

I decided to check out D's Spray Tanning with a Groupon.  She was very good with prompt communication and was flexible when it came to making an appt over Memorial Day weekend.  She did a great job of explaining the process step by step as well as the aftercare.  I was very impressed with her professionalism and personability.  I will definitely go to D for my next spray tan and have already referred her to a friend :).

We came here on a groupon and both of us were impressed.  We had veggie tempura, a dragon roll, ak roll and the miso soup.  Everything was fresh and well prepared.  The decor was modern and stylish..if we are back in this area we will definitely come back :)

I've been jonzing for a acai bowl so I decided to give this place a whirl.  Very good!  I also got the energizing smoothie which gave me a little morning pick me up.  Those two items came to $16 - yikes...so I will be returning, just maybe not as much as I'd like to.

Nice, hipster, downtown ambiance :) I had a burger and beer at the bar and I would definitely come back for that!

This is a great place to take kids on a field trip or outing.  The kids really enjoyed the 3D movie about a Monarchs' life cycle, getting to explore in the atrium and interacting with the sting rays.  I'm glad I went as part of a field trip b/c I feel the admission price is a bit much for such a short tour.  The food selections in the snack bar were sparse and a bit pricey.  There are several fast food places/restaurants on the next exit over (Indian Bend).  If it were cheaper, or they offered a local discount I would bring many guests here.

What a great little nugget in PHX.  I had the happy hour special: burger and a beer for $10.00.  Premium ingredients and who doesn't love a good pretzel bun?  The french fries were really extra crunchy.  I'm not sure which beer I had, I just asked for a light on tap but I really liked it.  Great little patio outside, will definitely be back for more!

I've been to the other locations and this one is by far my favorite..it's in a converted craftsman house so it has the feel of having dinner at a friend's place.  Huge patio..food is always excellent.  I've tried a lot of there apps..on this nite I had the pad thai..normally I'm leary of having a traditional ethnic dish anywhere mainstream but their's was really good! It had a smokey flavor to it.  I don't normally eat leftovers but this one made for a great lunch the next day.  I have a feeling this place will get crowded as soon as people know there's a downtown location!

Very cute coffee "lab".  Great patio facing the park.  I had a ice green tea and it was good and decently priced.  I would definitely like to hang out here again if I'm in the area.

This is definitely my go to place.  Where else do you get a hot stone massage included with your pedi?  For some magical reason my pedicures seem to last much longer when I go here too!  I've also gotten my eyebrows waxed here and been happy with the job.  Very Clean and beautiful decor...looks really expensive but the prices are very reasonable.  Bring Cash (it's their preference)

I was looking for a dog friendly patio to have lunch w/ a friend...not only are dogs allowed on their patio but they made us feel so welcome :).  Wide selection of every type of pasty you could imagine.  I also picked this spot because they had a wide range of vegetarian options (vs. other places with just one or two things).   My pasta salad was huge, flavors were on point, nice fresh ingredients! My friend had the Greek pasty that she let me try...Delish! Service was excellent! Friendliest staff I've come across in a while..will be back for sure with more friends!

I have been searching far and wide for decent Ramen in the valley and I think I may have finally found it..and on the happy hour menu no less :)  It came with pork belly and kimchee!  I just wish it was piping hot but it may have cooled down as we were noshing on the wedge salad and short ribs.  The cocktails were equally refreshing and they have a great patio area.  Great service, I will definitely be back to this downtown gem :)

So I've been hearing (and reading reviews) about this place and decided it was time to check it out!  We chose a Tuesday since I've been reading about the horror story wait times on the weekend.  Tuesday, 6:30pm, no wait for a table.  Ryan was our server and even though it was busy, he did a great job of explaining the menu and what to expect.  We ordered the snow crab and shrimp with sausage and corn with Trifecta seasoning.  The crab I was blown away by, I could eat that and the sausage every day for the rest of my life!  The shrimp and corn were a little overcooked for my liking.  This is messy eating, e.g. there is a sink in the dining room to wash up at after your meal..and it is loud..with a siren for birthdays going off every 15 minutes or so..so I would recc for the food and with a group, definitely not for a first date..lol.

I really liked this place!  I can see what it is so busy/popular.  It's a nice open restaurant with the vibe of a speak easy lounge or your eccentric uncle's house.  We had very attentive service and the food was fancy yet had a comfort food element to it.  The cocktails...wow!  Talk about attention to detail!  I had the Pineapple Pisco Sour...not only did it taste amazing but the presentation was so beautiful.  They embossed their emblem in cinnamon on the foam of the drink...uh, Starbucks needs to step up their game.

I've been curious to try this place for a while and I must say it was a very good toasted sub.  It's a little on the pricer end for a lunch spot but I will keep it in the rotation.

So, it's been a million years since I've practiced yoga on a regular basis..but I've been having some back problems and thought I'd give this a whirl after seeing it on Groupon.  I was kind of terrified of all the sweating that would be involved with hot yoga but now I kind of find it therapeutic.  Hot Pepper looks brand new and is clean.  I actually don't mind paying a little more for a studio vs. taking a class at a gym since at Hot Pepper the classes are smaller and it doesn't reek.  I love that you can order a green juice before class and it's ready for you as you leave.  Although this service isn't offered on Sundays :(.  Also love the online booking!

This is a great place in the heart of downtown Scottsdale to get your Happy Hour on! Especially since the HH menu goes till 11pm.  The decor is tiki/kitschy/cool...modern tiki vibe..very clean..tvs at the bar if you want to catch a game while enjoying your spirits and local grinds.  On this particular night we had a 2 year old in tow and they couldn't have been more gracious! (They even had a high chair). I was starving and my friends only a little hungry so they ordered pupus (ceviche and pork tacos) and I had the spicy ahi Caesar salad everyone was pleased with their food.  Large portion for a dinner salad..flavors were on point.  The specialty drinks are fruity and fun and usually come in a fun glass to compliment what's being served.  I love taking out of town guests here and so far everyone I bring compliments me on my great choice!

This was our first and probably last visit. We placed a takeout order with a teenage, blonde cashier who was "interesting"..to say the least. My boyfriend asked for a lid to his to go cup and she asked him if he could be patient (in a sarcastic tone)-yikes! Anyone who reads my reviews knows I'm big on service so that gets a 1 star in my book. The food took forever and when we got home they forgot his bread and gave me a dry chicken salad with nothing more then lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cucumbers..deconstructed sandwich? The portions were on the small side for the price. Not impressed.

I liked everything but their location.  Maybe that's my own personal preference, but I'd probably frequent it more if it was further down on Scottsdale road.  The acai bowl came in a large portion with very fresh large berries and granola.  The service was very helpful and friendly.

Wow..this is REALLY good korean food.  As in, we've been making this a weekly habit.  They have great combos so you can get a BBQ meat with your spicy tofu soup.  I also really like their side dishes...I mean, they have Korean pickles...you don't get that at any Korean place..that's mom and pop stuff.

Wow! I'm shocked to read other people's reviews.  I had a really positive experience with this company and would use them again.  I also purchased the living social deal for 3 hrs.  I scheduled the move via email, and their responses were timely.  They were available on the day and time that I needed them (maybe because I chose a Wednesday?)  The crew was Tito and Chris.  Both men were friendly and professional.  They completed the job on time and there was no damage to any of my items.

This location may want to just stick to lunch and dinner.  I ordered something on the breakfast menu and they made me pull around to the front and wait for 10+ minutes to get it.  So not so fast-fast food...which is way worse in the morning when you're trying to get into work on time.  The Raintree location has their sh*t together and gets you thru in a more timely fashion.

What a nice little gem!  I went around Xmas time and they had a lot of fun seasonal flavors.  My favorite was the candy cane.  Their array of toppings was also impressive.  I did try the waffle too and it was a nice indulgent treat.  The staff was also helpful and friendly.  Will frequent more as the weather heats up.

I think this place should change their name from "Snooze" to "Slooooow" or "Waaaaait".  Those are the adjectives I would use to describe this place.  So first off, we checked in for 2 people at 9am on a Sunday morning.  The hostess said it would be about a 30-50 minute wait (kind of a big window of time..but whatever it's Sunday morning).  We milled around and finally got sat after 40min.  We then ordered our food and waited....and then waited...for what seemed eternity but it could have been 30-40 minutes...I think our waiter over heard me complaining b/c he came by immediately after I said something to my husband and said to us and the table next to us "it will be 3 more minutes".  Then the food came out.  My was luke warm..my husband's was cold..and they forgot my side order of bacon.  So I'm thinking someone dropped the ball somewhere.  If it was warmer I would have said well at least the food was good.  We then asked for the bill almost immediately b/c we have just wasted 1.5 hours of our life and I was pretty sticker shocked to see my OJ (just plain OJ nothing fancy about it) was $4.  I feel like I should have went to the store, bought all the ingredients, made breakfast myself and I'd still have an hour to spare and $20 extra dollars in my pocket.      You would think a place that specializes in Brunch would have a more efficient system then the one we experienced.  No impressed.

I LOVE the Gift of Relaxation :)  I've been seeing Tamara monthly for about a year now.  She does such a wonderful job!  Total professional who takes the time to work out all your knots.  My whole body feels rejuvenated after a 90 minute session.  She is very friendly and personable.  Her prices are reasonable so I can afford to come in on a regular basis.  Highly, highly recommend!

I had heard of this place and was excited to try it...on trivia night no less.  They had an endless list of beers to try, I settled on a Stella.  For dinner I had one of their hotdogs and a caesar salad as a side.  The food was decent.  The trivia was really fun!  Nice atmosphere, great place to hang out with friends!

This is a very clean, inviting and friendly studio.  You really can't beat the price for monthly membership.  I've enjoyed the classes with all the instructors so far.  I also love that they have a juice bar that will take your order before class and have it ready after. I know they are new but I'm hoping in the future they offer more weekend classes and classes earlier in the morning. Aside from that I highly recommend this studio :) Update: looks like they added more morning and weekend classes..plus the cold towel and aromatherapy at the end is the highlight of my day.

I'm really shocked to see negative reviews.  I've been to this Mellow Mushroom 2xs since it has opened and both me and the people I have been with loved it.  Both times I went on a Saturday night and at the most waited 15 min to be seated.  The small salad was big enough to share for two people.  My favorite pizza so far for this meat lover has been the veggie.   The veggie had tofu on it, which sounds like it wouldn't work but actually complimented the pie nicely.  But I think the wow factor is their crust.  I don't know what's in it, but it is so dang good.  They had a huge selection of beer and spirits and their regular drinks come in gi-normous cups so you will never need a refill.  Will be back again soon fo sho!
