About $8 a sandwich.  A little out of the way.  The philly cheese steak was good.  As always, I threw in peppers.  Yum.

I love this place ever since my cousin introduced it to me last year in Vegas.  The tapas bar has many different plates to share.  My favorited being the stuffed dates, paella, filet mignon sliders, olives, fries, and much more.  They have the best sangria hands down.  I would come to firefly, just for that!  A nice cold pitcher sangria in the desert heat!

Our last night in Vegas, the boyfriend and I decided to do a nice dinner.  I've heard great things about Gallagher's, so we decided to give this restaurant a try.  We were seated right away by the hostess, and then greeted by our server.  Our server was very charming, attentive, and thorough.  We started with the calamari for our appetizers.  Very good, i might add.  And for our entrees we both ordered the dry aged new york steak.  When our steak arrived we were in awe.  The dry aged new york steak was so thick and huge, it could feed two people!  It was juicy and mouthwatering good.  I almost finished mine with an exception of a few pieces.  But what do you expect when you get a hungry girl whose had her last 4 meals at various buffets (which I hate).  So, Gallagher's was the cherry on top of my trip to vegas.

Hit or miss.  Be prepared to dig.  A lot of items are more or less refurbished.  I didn't have the patience to go through the clothing racks.  But somehow both my best friend and I ended up with 5 pairs of heels each...prices goes as follows...  vera wang flats $49 Michael kors boots $30 Cole haan boots $50 enzos at $19 a pop... & more  what a steal!  if you have small feet 6.5 and under shoes are additional 35% off!  There were tons of uggs for toddlers.  Toms that were devoured in 2 seconds.    A few pairs of tory burch ballet flats here and there.  but the condition was crap.  But i do believe at the time they had a huge selection of tory burch in size 9 and 10.  I will definitely be returning to stock up on heels.

After journeying many times to Vegas, I've finally figured it out.  When in Vegas, your choice of hotel, is extremely important.  IMO.  The activities you divulge yourself in, includes the amenties that your hotel has to offer.  Over July 4th, weekend, I stayed here at Mandalay Bay in a 2 bedroom corner suite with strip view.  And it was goooooood.  My bed super comfy, jet tub in the bathroom, and living room.  The pool was great as well.  Plenty of people gambling in the casino downstairs, the way it should be.  And while you're gambling at the table how can you turn down the free alcohol!?

all you need is the right amount of alcohol and your girls!  make your way to the VIP area so you don't have to be packed in like sardines.  only complaint...the bouncers are the biggest douches in the world.  I guess they need to compensate somehow.

I hate buffets to begin with, so this is a pretty biased review.  My friends and I were in town during the special, $29.99 all you can eat for 24 hours, at all participating harrah hotels.  Line was long, about a 1 hour wait, which is expected.  Got our wristbands, and headed for our first meal in vegas.  The only good thing I recall was the prime rib, although a little too rare for my liking.  Other than that, buffet food is pretty nasty to me.  Right when we left, my friend's wristband snapped off, we tried to get management to issue a new one, and they refused.  They said it's good as long as we have the reciept to go along with it.  Well, the next night for dinner, the buffet at Rio, told us something completely different.

I am quite disappointed by this place.  My friend had recommended it to me, and everytime I pass by this restaurant, I've always wanted to try it, although never had the chance.  So finally come april, when I was in Vegas, I decided this would be a perfect place to stop by for some lunch.  I ordered the blended guava margarita, which was so strong, I had to trade drinks with my boyfriend.  He ordered a coco cabana, which was made to perfection.  I loved it, and decided to order a second one for myself while he ordered a blended drink next.  This time my coco cabana turned out very strong like my first drink had been, so I again decided to switch with my boyfriend.  His drink was pretty darn good!  But why the inconsistency???  Next for my entree I ordered the sea bass which was $25 market price...Let me tell you, holy moly, my rice on the side was DRENCHED in oil and grease that I could barely eat anything off my plate.  Same with the entree my significant other had ordered.  He had a jambalaya, and again his plate was filled with grease.  I'm sorry, but that's disgusting!  Totally not worth the price they are charging.  Will not go back again, and the two stars are just for the two drinks my boyfriend ordered.

Wait wasn't so long.  However, when we got to the front of the line, my friend had trouble getting in because his wristband had snapped off.  Lago Buffet had told us it was okay as long as we had the reciept.   Although everything was barcoded and we had the reciept, both the hostess and the manager tried to refuse him admission to the buffet.  We were there arguing for about 3 minutes before he gave in and said okay.  So, when we got to the buffet, it was an overwhelming selection.  The plates were so small, that you would have make several trips.  Which i think is pretty smarts, it keeps people from overloading their plates.  Again, nothing special, but just a wider variety of food.  Our server was great though.  Kept refilling my water glass, and did not hesitate or give any attitude when we asked for different beverages throughout the course of our meal.

I stayed at Mandalay Bay July 4th weekend in a 2 bedroom suite.  I got super drunk the day I got on the 3rd, and ordered food to go at around 4 in the morning.  My burger was suppose to be medium well, but when I ate it in my room, my burger was burnt like the desert sun.  It was utterly dry.  I didn't mind to much, since I was drunk, and was supe hungry.    the next night, I went back and asked for a plastic fork for my leftovers from the same host from the previouse night.  Her name was Connie, and she refused to give us plastic forks.  She then told my boyfriend and I to order from room service to obtain a fork.  This was unacceptable to me, because who the hell refuses to give a freaking plastic fork?  So, I demanded to talk to her manager Karen.  Karen opened the drawer to the podium, the hostess Connie was in front of and pulled out 2 plastic forks?  I was so dammmmmn upset at the point.  You had them right in the drawer at the podium and rather put up a fight and give customer bad attitude than just open your stupid drawer and give us the plastic forks?  This I do not understand, whatsoever.  It's something small, but when it's something that small the hostess should not have made a problem out of this.  I took the liberty of calling the food and beverage manager, I believe his name is Jason, and filed a complaint.  I do hope that he took this seriously and took appropriate action.  There are plenty of people that are looking for a job, so Connie, you are indeed replaceable.  If you don't want a job that require those particular hours, look elsewhere.  I really wanted to have breakfast at Raffles on my last day here, however  I refused to go back/

Only because my friends and I had a s*it ton of fun here after the giants vs. dback game.  Drink prices are cheap compared to the inflated $10.75 i paid at the ballpark.  I recommend hanging out with your brew outside.

Can't beat the value.  We're talking $6 for a sandwich on the STRIP.  Impossible???  Well it exists.  Sampled a few sandwiches with the girls.  Montague was meh.  But the Carribean Jerk Chicken made my taste buds tingle.  The sauce was perfect to give moisture to the chicken.  With that extra spicy kick. how can I ever resist?  I also really like the bread that the sandwich comes on.  It's Crispy and light.  YUMMMMMM!  They are quick and efficient.

Best hotel I've stayed at by far!  I was there in the summer with my family.  and we had a room on like the 45th floor.  Sweeping view of the strip.  Amenities are great.  This hotel has about 5+ pools.  Very nice shops.  And is convienient to fashion show mall.  Would love to stay here again!

Mac & Cheese for the win.  I even had leftovers for my drunken self after an epic night of clubbing.  The teapot filter, there was super cool, nothing I've ever seen.  Order tea, and you'll see what I'm talking about.  It smells delightful in there.  I left the restaurant with my hair smelling like chocolate.  Prices are reasonable for the strip, borderline cheap.  Our server was attentive and was pretty cute, which made dinner more enjoyable.

Great diner.  Huge portions.  Good service.  The biscuits and gravy is actually good as per yelp recommended.  A little hard to find if you're driving by and not paying attention.  The bill came out to $38 for 4 people.    Not going to lie...the patrons here are a little on the heftier side....

Rooftop.   Friendly service! $2 jello shots out of a syringe.  Best thing ever! But it was pretty dead given it was a Friday night.
