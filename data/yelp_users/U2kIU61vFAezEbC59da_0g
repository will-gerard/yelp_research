They over cooked our steak & all they offer was to make US another steak so we have to wait. Not a good service.

This place is cozy & casual place to have a good Street Tacos & Water Melon Margarita(it's a must try) But also ask for Peppermint Margarita thats my number #1 but it's only seasonal.

The people who works in there were so friendly. The applepie squares is a must to buy when you guys go to this place.

I love this Salon. I moved to Phoenix almost 2years ago but I'm having hard time to look for a perfect Stylist just the one that I have in LA. I have super thick & long hair, but Emily Claire manage it perfectly just the way I wanted to be. Last summer I decided to lighten up my hair & she really did a great job. I can't wait for my next appointment to change my hair color.

Seafood are soooo fresh specially the oysters. I'm a seafood lover & it's my 1st time eating in Pappadeaux & I'm definitely gonna come back. Service is great as well.

Food & service is amazing. We had a party of 8 & we didnt even need to wait. I ordered half Thai Dye(which was the best PIZZA ive ever had in my whole life) & half Maui Wowie. We also had Pretzel & Spinach dip w/ pita & they were good as well. The restaurant itself is vegetarian friendly too which is fantabulous.

I don't know why people gave this buffet resto low ratings? Do you guys really know good food? I'm a food lover(foodholic) & I always love to try to go to different restaurants just to try it( food adventure is fun ) I love exploring different kind of cuisines. So I guess for me I really like Lin's because of its affordable price, nice atmosphere & it's clean. I can't say it's the best Chinese buffet or food that I've ever tried but it's good.
