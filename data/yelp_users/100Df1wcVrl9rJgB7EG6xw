This is a hard review to right.  Again, I wish Yelp had 1/2 stars because it this review would really be at 3.5 stars.  I have been to several gyms before (golds, 24 hr fitness, tangible) and the one thing I hated at all of them were the fact that they were always busy with people who seemed to have an intimidating aura.  This place isnt like that.  It is quite big and has pretty decent equipment.  I usually go workout with my trainer (Jesse) around 530 and we always are able to workout with no waiting for having to share machines.  They have a lane pool, jacuzzi and sauna rooms.  It kind of reminds me of the YMCA downtown Tucson.  The only problem that I have with the place is the smell in the men's locker room.  I dont know if it is because they are in the basement and the sewer pipes are old but man does it smell!  The membership is kinda pricey but it is close to my house so that saves on gas right?

I actually stumbled upon this place when I was on my diet and I have been a fan since.  I love that it is a local place and it is family owned.  Not to mention they are Chicago Cubs fans!!!    The food is great and the portions are just enough.  I love the chicken picado salad and love that it comes with warm pita bread as well.  It is always busy around lunch time but clears out around 1 or so on the weekdays.  I have been here on weekends and the place is pretty quiet.    The only complaint is that it can be pretty slow sometimes but the food makes up for it!

I had not been here for a few years but glad that I decided to come back.  I had their penne pasta with meat sauce and it was a huge portion with great flavor.  I really like their red sauce, it had a lot of flavor and was rich.  My bf had their meatball sub which again was a huge portion and he liked it a lot.  Next time we come back we will have to try their pizza!  Great job and keeping up with the times Streets of NY!

I had some pretty good sushi at this place last week.  I didnt even know it was there!  The inside and atmosphere is pretty laid back and chill.  The sushi is good, we had 4 rolls and they were all good size and all tasted great!  Our waitress was very friendly and made sure we were always hydrated!  I am for sure gonna come back here!

Service here is awful.  Came in to a not so busy restaurant and was never seated, even after 3 groups of people came in after us.  They seemed to have a lot of people doing nothing.  I wouldn't recommend this place at all.

My review is actually of the Afternoon Tea and not the hotel in general.  Let me just say I am really a little speechless because the afternoon tea experience was amazing!  Jeffery, the tea extraordinare was amazing to us the entire time and we left with one of the best experiences.  So if you are looking for a place to spend a couple hours and want to try something new, try afternoon tea at the Ritz, it is amazing!

This place was right off the freeway on my way to Tucson.  I loved that it wasn't busy at all and I was able to get in and out.  The guys working here were friendly and didn't try to up-sell me at all.

I really liked this place.  I live in the same complex and this was my first time I had been there.  My bf and I went for an early dinner before a movie and it was very low-key and nice to be able to come in and sit and be served right away.  We had parmesan fries which were recommended and were very tasty.  My bf had a burger and I had a chicken sandwhich.  The food was great, the service was better...all in all, a great experience!

Actually wanted to give it a 3.5...not quite a 3 but not quite a 4 either.  I had the hot and sour soup and the mongolian beef!  The hot and sour soup was one of the best I have ever had!  It had tons of flavor and was actually spicy!  I would go back just for that!  The mongolian beef was just ok, it tasted like it was cooked on a burned wok or something.  The decor inside was cute and the little old lady waiting on me was super nice!  I am always on the lookout for a good chinese restaurant so I am gonna go back and try some of their other stuff!

This is no Pollo Feliz from Tucson.  The chicken had a good flavor but the beans and salsa left little to be desired.  It is another run of the mill chain that cranks out orders of already prepared stuff...boring!

Really good food that is fast and healthy.  I normally get the chicken, rice-less, with extra veggies and the spicy sauce.  The food is always hot and is just the right amount.  The people here are nice as well!  It is a great alternative!

This was my 2nd time going to this specific Jiffy Lube location and both time the service has been great.  This location usually isnt busy so I try to go on my lunch break and I am in and out of there with enough time to have my lunch!  The guys that work there are really nice and honest with what you need.  So far so good!  Keep up the good work guys!

I am so glad I found this place because I have been a fan of their restaurants in Tucson, AZ.  I had the chicken tacos which were good and the charro beans were excellent too.  Not too much bad to say about this place...the food is great and it is right near work so a good place to go.  You wont find great service here but the food out weighs that expereince by far.

This place is really hidden behind the ghost town that is Metro Center but that shouldn't stop you from trying this place.  The food actually really surprised me.  I haven't been able to find much authentic Mexican food here in Phoenix and this place is a little closer to home!  The tacos had a really good crunch and flavor.  The rice tasted like it was fresh and not hard and crunchy like some other places.  The prices were reasonable and I would definitely come back again!

his location is awesome!  The guys that work there are super friendly and really try to help you out as much as you can.  I have been here twice and both times I have been treated well.  The last time I went here I had a nail in my tire and needed to get it replaced.  I arrived first thing in the morning and was greeted by someone and my tire was fixed and was out the door in 30 mins.  Keep up the good work guys!  Thank you for keeping us safe on the road!

This place is really nothing to look at but the good thing is that the food is pretty decent for the price and portion.  I ordered a small mongolian beef for lunch with a hot and sour soup.  The lunch portion was pretty big and the soup was easily enough for two.  The great thing was that I had enough for the lunch the next day!    This place is near work and is pretty reasonable so I will probably go there again when in need of chinese food!

This is really a hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale.  We were there with a large party and they were able to accommodate us.  Their wine selections are pretty impressive and they also have other choices for those who do not like wine.  We were there when they had a live band, which was awesome!  The band was great and encouraged everyone to dance and have a good time!  I will recommend this place to anyone that wants to have a chill place to hang and have a good time with friends!

I love Nordstrom, let me start off my saying that.  But the last few times I have been there, going back to the holiday season, the service has left little to be desired.  I worked for about 3 years in retail at this very same mall and I was told when I first started to never judge a book by its cover in Scottsdale because the people you perceive as not having money probably have more money than god.  When I go into a department store I want to be treated nicely, to ask if I need anything but I have received none of that when I come into this store.  This time I was in the shoe department wanting to buy a pair of shoes.  There were several people around trying on shoes and whatnot.  It seemed like there were a lot of workers there too so I was wondering around looking and never once did anyone ask if I was ok or needed anything.  I found what I wanted, picked up the shoe and stood there for a bit waiting to see if anyone would come and help me.  Nothing!  So I walked to the middle of the floor and stood some more and tried to get someone's attention.  I knew what I wanted, knew the size so it would take any more than someone to run back to get the shoes.  I finally caught someone's attention and asked if he could help me...he looked at me said "Um, I guess there is no one else around" grabbed the shoe from me and said "what size?"  I told  him what size I needed and as he walked away he motioned to his other customer that he had to go get my shoe and kind of shrugged.  I sat there for 30 seconds, got up and left.  I felt so annoyed and disrespected as a customer that no matter how much I wanted those shoes I would rather buy online if I have too.  Nordstrom this has been a trend for you.  I often shop at The Rail in your store and the people there are snobby and rude.  If you are selling high end stuff maybe you should start hiring high end people and not people who think they are above anyone because the "basic" customer is your repeat customer who will probably end up spending more money with you over the course of a year than the one time shopper!

Buca is a great place to get a lot of food that you can share.  The food is tasty and can be a good place to go when you want something a little more than Oreganos or Olive Garden.  I would recommend this place for big families or parties that like family style food!

I have not eaten at AZ 88 in years!  I was happy to find out that things had not changed since I had been there and that is a good thing!  My bf and I went there after an event and had a pretty amazing dinner.  The portions are just right (enough for a doggy bag if you can contain yourself) and the menu is pretty extensive.  I love the atmosphere and I love the music that they play.  I forget that AZ 88 has a pretty good martini selection as well.  I for sure am going back and will try and make it for happy hour!

I always forget about Delux only because Zinburger is closer to me but I really do like Delux better.  I had their new hot dog option which was really good.  They bring out a bunch of condiments to add to your hot dog, although jalapenos are $1 extra.  The fries are really good too! I love the atmosphere here as well.  Our waitress was really friendly and super attentive.    The only thing I didn't like was seeing the owner "scold" one of the waiters, who looked new, in front of the customers.  I think that should be done away from the ears of paying customers.  I also do not like when you see a manager or an owner in house and they do not go to any tables to say hello or how was the food.

I had heard so much about this place so I was excited to try it and see what they hype was about.  Needless to say that I was not impressed at all with what I had.  This place was really situated confusing for a first timer.  I ended up making my mind and having the machaca and white rice.  This meal was nothing to write home about.  Actually, my grandmother and mom made meals similar to this for years with better ingredients and better flavor.  The rice was cold and dry and the meat was cold and flavorless.  I probably wont be taking the drive back out there again unless it is for the snickerdoodle cookies they give which was the best part of the meal!

I had an amazing stay here!  The staff at check-in was amazing, the rooms were beautiful and the pool is awesome!  I wish they didn't stop service at the pool at 5pm during the summer or on the weekends.  And, it would have been nice not to have to pay for self-parking.  Other than that it is an awesome property and will be back!

I really do like this place.. It has a really awesome vibe inside and a beautiful patio area outside.  It does get really busy on weekend so be prepared to wait a bit for a table but I think the food is worth it.  We had really great service which seems to be a rarity in the valley anymore.  I had the short rib tacos which were excellent.  The flavor was amazing and the homemade tortillas were delicious.  We also had the shrimp cheviche which looked great. (I am not a shrimp lover so I did not have any.)

We ate at Sauce for their 2 for $20 summer deal yesterday for lunch.  We ordered the caesar salad (which was a good portion for 2 to share), the chicken pesto pizza (which by the way is a white pizza, we didnt find this out until it came to our table but the manager offered to add pizza sauce to it which made it even better) and two glasses of wine.  Sauce is a good place that I tend to forget about because the pizza is in my opinion forgetable.  The staff was nice and prompt which lead me to give the 4 star rating.

Pei Wei, why oh why did you think it would be smart of change your menu and the look of your original concept?  I personally think it was a bad move!  I hate that there are not many of the original items on the menu at this new, remodel.    I had the BBQ Korean dish which didnt really have much flavor and was kind of bland!  I also miss the separate line there use to be for people who called in or ordered online.  I probably won't be coming back to this location.  If I need to I will find another location that has the old items because those items are what made Pei Wei one of my favorites!

Love, love this place!  The cheesesteaks are amazing and they so many different ones to choose from.  Plus they are open 24/7!   The only thing I have to complain about was the girl at the cash register.  I know they last thing she wants to do is probably work in the food industry but have a smile on your face and at least make a little conversation.

Great room, great location and really helpful staff.  The bed was super comfy and the decor in the room was modern and updated!  I loved the sectional couch that was in the room, it made it possible for 2 people to lay down and watch TV.  The continental breakfast is also a great perk for those staying here.  It has lots of options for everyone!  I would definitely recommend this place again!

The food at Pita Jungle is really good but the service at the 2 locations I have been at is always the same, horrible!  I came into this location to have dinner with 3 other people and walked in and asked for a table and the hostess sat 4 people who came in after me before me.  When she walked back she said, "Oh, I forgot that you needed a table for 4 as well.  Something will clear up soon."  Then our waitress was a little less than thrilled to be helping us.  The food took forever to get to our table and we were never asked if we wanted more drinks, we had to ask another waiter for help.  I am all for supporting local establishments but Pita Jungle is hard to support when they seem so uninterested in their customers.

Went here to get a grill that was on sale for labor day...hollar for a $99 gas grill!  We asked for help and right away someone helped us get the grill we wanted and helped us get it into our car!  Ben, the associate helping us, was really nice and a great customer service person.  They even had someone right away help us get our full tank of propane!  Good job Home Depot!

Really good place to get your workout!  It is small but spacious gym with a lot of equipment.  I love it because you can get in and out and not have to spend hours at the gym looking for space or a cardio machine.  And if you like tanning, you can go next door for a good tan session!

Good ol' Safeway!  I really do love this store and this location.  I have tried other places like FnE or the Safeway on McDowell and I always come back to the Osborn locations.  It at times can truly be one stop shopping...from the US Bank, to the pharmacy, to getting basics.  The only thing I hate is that sometimes they dont have coverage on their lines late at night at it can take a long time to check out.  But their produce cannot be beat, they have certain products that I love always in stock!

The service and the food was great!  We came here on a groupon deal and it was really worth it.  I had the farmers basket soup as a starter and it was delicious.  I loved the flavors.  It could almost be ordered as an entree.  For dinner I had one of their pizzas which was enough for 2 people to share.  I loved the thin, crispy crust and the flavors were good as well.  The desserts were pretty decent as well.  Our waiter was really attentive and recommended dishes and helped in our selection.  I really like this hotel in general and recommend staying there and eating at Tuscany if you are able to.

This was my 3rd time I had been to Aiello's and it was all around the best yet again.  I love the fact that the pricing is right which means that the taste and style of the food does not suffer.  The people working there are very friendly and knowledgable in what they are serving as well.  I had the Pork Chops with hot peppers, and let me tell you, it was YUM!  My friend has the italian sasuage and peppers (which he said was the best he had ever had).  The wine was great too!  I also love when they come to your table and ask you to pick a number between 1-90, if you guess the correct number, you dinner is free!  It will happen to me one day!  I also love the fact that the owner comes and chats with you and makes sure everything is ok, you can tell he takes pride in his cooking and restaurant.  If you are looking for amazing italian food in Phoenix, look no further than Aiello's!  They also well pizza's in the back every night!

Again, Aiello's was an amazing experience!  I took my bf here for his birthday and it was another great meal.  The service is really what makes the experience a 5-star, along with the amazing food.  I love walking into a restaurant and smelling the great food instantly.  We ordered the caprese salad, which was comp't because the server was embarrassed to bring it out with no basil, which they were out of!  I had the ziti and the bf had tortilini.  The meal was amazing and the service was top-notch!  We had a chance to chat with the owner a couple of times.  I love this place and will keep coming back when I need a great Italian food fix!

Had dinner here one night and I would probably rate it has a 2.5.  They claim to have the best fish and chips in town so my bf ordered them and he was not overly impressed with them at all.  The fish looked like they were drowning in batter and the fries were cold and not very good.  Our server was ok, not overly friendly and not overly rude either.  I probably do not have to come back to this place.  If I want a pub feel I will probably head to the George and Dragon, at least there they have blackberry crumble!

I think this restaurant could be really good except for the service.  When a hotel knows they are fully booked, it is a safe bet that your restaurants will be busy as well.  With that being said, wouldn't it make sense to make sure your staff is fully staffed as well?   The food was average, not bad but not amazing either.  I wanted to try their breakfast buffet but after the poor service we received for dinner I figured it wasn't worth our time to try it a second time.

My bf and I drove in from "the city" lol and met some friends here for brunch.  We didnt have to wait long to get seated which was great.  The waitress came and took our drink order and right away she didnt seem too thrilled.  So I ordered an omelet and asked for turkey sausage instead of the toast or pancakes it came with, she looked at me like I was asking for a cure to cancer and proceeded to tell me that I would have to be charged full-price.  Well duh, I kinda figured and since I asked it was probably ok.  Needless to say, we waited 30 mins to get our food, which we had to ask her for.  My omelet was cold, I didnt get the turkey sausage I had ordered but she did add it to the check.  Thank god we had a groupon or else it would have been a total loss.  The Breakfast Club in Old Town is better!

I really do like this place for brunch/lunch.  I went there with my sister, her bff and my bf and we all had a good experience.  The good is great and really flavorful.  The only problem that I have is sometimes the service is hit or miss.  It took a while for us to get served at the beginning but the food made up for it.    I will return to try other items on the menu and to give the service a 2nd try!

I love coming to this place!  The pizza is always very good and so are the salads!  The one thing I love about this place is that they carry a Cabernet Frac and by the glass!  The service is so-so, the waitresses really don't pay that much attention to you but the food and wine make up for it all.  Oh and I dont like the complementary vallet either, it is a small parking lot and kind of annoying for those who do not like to vallet.

This place is amazing!  I walked into the store the other day, to get some essentials and walked out wanting to go back and get a ton of other stuff. The produce was really fresh and it looked like the meats were as well.  They have a bakery, a small restaurant and a place where you can get salsa, guacamole and mexican drinks.  The place is big, clean and really affordable!  Nice job El Rancho!

I wish there were 1/2 stars because in all honesty I would give it 2.5 stars but my experience was less than superior so I am not going to give it 3 stars.  I live right next door to this fairly new restaurant and always thought it was a convienent place to grab lunch or dinner.  Last night after the gym I went home and had nothing in my fridge so I decided to place an order at the Phoenix location.  I ordered a spicy chicken wrap with no rice or cauliflower, which to me seems like a pretty basic order...I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I looked at the clock and it read 7:14pm.  So I got dressed and headed down and walked in the door at 7:30pm.  The guy at the front door was super nice, and told me that someone else would help me.  I told the guy that I had placed an order to go and the 1st problem, he couldnt find my to-go ticket anywhere.  I have a feeling they never printed it out, which in turn never got handed to the kitchen.  I paid for my dinner and proceeded to wait another 15 minutes for my very plain spicy chicken wrap to arrive.  All in all my wait time was 30 mins!!!  You know I dont mind waiting most of the time but when I call my order in and am told 15 mins, I expect 15 mins!  And no one ever came to me and apologized for the wait or anything!  I know my review probably wont make a difference but to the owner or manager of this location, get staff that seem interested in what they do and hire kitchen staff that can get things out on time.  Won't be eating at Pita Jungle for a while...i will give my business to Athenian Express or Switch if I want a quick and delicious meal.

I really wasn't impressed with this place at all.  After reading all the reviews I thought the burgers there would change my life but really my life wasn't changed at all.  They have a sign saying they were voted " The Best Burgers in Phoenix" but my experience wasn't the best.  I will start off with the good... 1. The decor and atmosphere is cool.  This would be a cool place to go and watch a game with your friends at the bar.    The bad 1. They should serve all burgers with a knife if they are going to be that big!  I didnt get a knife and my waitress was not around enough for me to ask for one.  2. I asked for my burger medium and I got well done.  The outside of the burger was kind of burnt as well.  3. The flavor of the burger was just ok, nothing amazing at all.  4. The service was the pits.  Our waitress was around maybe twice and we had to ask another waitress for a refill on our drinks and the other waitress looked less than thrilled when we asked for refills.  I would rather go to Zinburger or Delux where they have the same atmosphere, better service and probably better burger in my opinion.

I understand some people do not like the price of the menu items at Zinburger but lets face it, we are not going to McDonalds, it is a "gourmet" burger place, so expect to pay a little bit more.  On that note, I had the Turkey Sloppy Joe and I loved it!  The flavor was amazing and it was topped with a poblano pepper and pepperjack cheese!  The bread is lightly toasted and compliments the sandwiches great!  The fries are not bad, not really great but not bad.  Although the burgers are not huge like some other places (the grind), the flavors and the actual atmosphere is a lot better!

As some people know, I rarely ever give 5 stars but the Vig Uptown really deserves it.  My bf and I went there with a couple of friends and were really surprised we hadn't been there before.  The atmosphere is pretty cool and the bar area is big for when two people or yourself want to go and enjoy a drink.  They have a pretty cool enclosed patio area with seating and a fireplace for those cool desert nights.  The food is great as well.  We all tried something different and were amazed at the flavors and the portions are enough to take some home.  We had an amazing waiter who gave us recommendations and made sure we always had a full glass of wine.  This is someplace that I will come to again for sure!  I think that it is way better than St. Francis or places like that in the area!

Pretty cool place.  I went there to get my eyebrows waxed and it was easy to get an appointment the next day.  The girl who did my eyebrows was really nice, talkative and did a really good job fixing my eyebrows.  I will return!  The only thing I didnt like was seeing the girls at the front desk eating when I walked in.  There should always be a break room in any salon where employees can enjoy their breakfast, lunch or break!

I am a big fan of this place.  I love the fact that you can order and submit everything online and if there is a problem they will call you and let you know.  The pricing and quality really can't be beat!  I will use this printer as long as I have events that need a good quality program!

Gasper's may not look like much from the outside but the inside is a whole different story.  This place is super cute inside!  I have been on a "eat local" kick for a while so I was excited to try this place that I had been hearing about from friends.  The people are super nice and seated us right away.    The menu was pretty diverse and has everything from antipasta, salad and pizza to normal pasta dishes.  My bf had penne pasta with a tomato cream sauce and meat balls.  I had the eggplant parm which was great!  The food was amazing and I am so glad that we found this place!  There is a lot on the menu that I want to try so I will be returning to this place!  Good Job Gasper's!

I think I finally found a good cleaners here in Phoenix!  I have tried a lot of them and I think American Cleaners has finally gotten it right.  The prices are amazing... $2.25!  The lady who helped me in the AM was super nice and chatted with me about the Voice and American Idol.  The shirts came back to my liking!  I am coming back here for all my laundry needs and to get a couple of suits dry cleaned!  Thank you American Cleaners!

I have to say, I would rather spend 2.16 on a coffee from Dunkin Donuts than 5.34 from Starbucks.  Today I got a large coffee with 2 splenda, coconut flavor and some cream and it is de-lish!  America runs on Dunkin!  This location in nice for me as it is on the way to work.  The only problem I have is that when you go inside the service is kind of slow because you have 3 people working the drive-thru and only 1 person working the inside cash register.  Spread the love!

Another great meal at Beckett's Table!  We originally went to another restaurant but was given a 2 hour wait so we decided to look on Yelp and see what was in the neighborhood and Beckett's Table it was!  We waited for about 5 minutes before we were seated.  The wine list is small but mighty!  They have some pretty good selections and a lot of U.S. made wine which is good in my book!  We ordered 2 appetizers, the brussel sprouts and the chicken meatballs!  Both of the dishes were really good and the portions were just right.  Then we ordered our main courses... there were 4 of us and we ordered the Pork Chop, Short Ribs, and the beef bourguignon shepard's pie.  All of it was really good!  There is a sort of "richness" in all of their dishes and a hat should be tipped to the chef because not many places create interesting and unique flavors.  The one thing that was off was our server.  She seemed really disconnected which really annoyed me considering we were there for the complete experience.  It seemed like she was in a rush to get us in and out.  Before we even got our appetizers she asked if we were ready to order our main course and before we were done with our main courses she was already pushing dessert.  We also had to ask another waiter to get us silverware because she never replaced it after our appetizers.  I will come back here and really make it a 1st choice in the future...lets hope we get a better waiter/waitress!

So we decided to come back and give this place another  try and it was  a lot better than our first experience!  We had the fondue first, which was more than enough for 2 people to share.  I had the chicago dog, again and my bf had a hamburger.  The service was awesome and our waitress made sure we had more than enough wine!  Looks like Windsor has been ironing out their kinks and really making it into a cool, fun space to hang out and eat!

Cute ice cream place in Central Phoenix!  I like that it has the feel of an old ice cream and candy store.  The flavors are good and the service is good as well.  I wish there was more seating for people that want to chill and enjoy their ice cream.  Good, modern place for Central Phoenix!

What a great place!  I have driven by this place so many times but always forget about it.  I went on a weekend when it wasn't horribly busy.  The space is cool and has a modern vibe.  I had the lunch special which was a salad or soup and a 9in pizza of any kind.  I had the minestrone and the meat lovers pizza.  Great pizza and great flavors!  I would for sure come back here again!

This gym is pretty cool actually. I love the fact that even when I go after work, there are enough cardio machines that I do not have to wait around.  The space is big and it has a lot of updated equipment.  The staff is always friendly and always says hi!  I even saw one of the trainers helping someone change their tire outside. The price is even better than the actual gym.  SO far so good with my experiences there!

If you like simple, Raising Cane's is the place to go.  All they serve is chicken strips so do not come here if you are thinking you can get an alternative because you cannot.  I love the flavor of the chicken and I love the crinkle cut fries!  The toast is really good and the Cane's sauce is some of the best I have had!

My bf and I came here while playing hooky from work one day (me that is, not him).  The inside is huge and really neatly and cleanly decorated!  There is so much space that a portion it could easily be used for a private function or private party.  We had lunch here and was surprised at the small crowd but by the time we left there was a pretty good crowd of people inside.  I had a burger and a side salad and it was really made well.  My bf had a chicken sandwich and fries and he seemed to enjoy it as well.  A pro is that they had malt vinegar, which goes well with fries.  Our waitress was really nice and attentive as well.  She kept us well hydrated on iced tea and diet coke.  There were TV's all over the place and the bar looked like it had several good beers on tap.  This is a place I want to return because of the good food, nice service and cool atmosphere!

This place was recommended by so many people so we decided to give it a try.  Right away we walked in didn't know if someone would greet us or if we should seat ourselves.  One of my biggest pet peeves in any restaurant is walking in and not being immediately greeted.  We stood there or a minute or so and the waitress walked up to us and looked at us like she was confused and we had to ask her for a table of two, isn't that your job?  I witnessed them do the same thing to several other parties that walked in behind us.  The service was the worst part of this experience.  It didn't seem like anyone knew what they were doing or who was taking what tables.  The food was just ok.  I had a burrito and the bf had something I can't recall.  My experience was just eh, could have been better but then I guess it could have been worse.

This is a really cool place or sushi!  I went by myself one day and ordered one roll and was so happy that I could custom make the roll anyway I wanted.  The rolls are actually really big.  I like this place and will return!

We went to this place to visit a friend who was working and decided that we would have lunch as well.  I am normally a picky person when it comes to Mexican food but this place was actually A-Ok in my book.  Is it 100% authentic, probably not but they do have some things that are actually pretty good and decent.  They start you off with chips, salsa and some kind of bean dip.  The salsa was good but the bean dip I thought was amazing!  I had the red chili burrito with rice and charro beans.  The burrito was good, the chili had good flavors.  The charro beans were good as well but the rice was a little overdone.  My bf had the chicken/steak fajitas which looked and smelled really good.  There was a ton of food left over that he took half of it home!  The decor is really nice and they have a beautiful outside patio.  If you go there sit in Rich's section, he will take care of you!  Oh and thank you Garcia's for putting an extra large bottle of Chalula on the table!

I just happened upon this place one day and I have to say the food is really good.  I am always on the hunt for good Mexican food, which is very hard to come by in Phoenix.  My first visit I had the pozole.  It was so good!  The service was friendly and the place looked new and clean!  I am a fan!

I was so excited to see a Potbelly Sandwich shop was opening up in Phoenix.  I had grabbed a delicious sandwich from Potbelly many times while on the east coast and always loved their simple but great approach to sandwiches.  I had the ham and cheddar on multi-grain bread with mustard, tomatoes, pickles and hot peppers...It was so good!  The hot peppers sure do have a kick and really complimented the sandwich!  I recommend adding the hot peppers to any sandwich, only if you can take the heat!  If you really like the hot peppers, you can purchase your own jar for $6.95! It was their 2nd day open so some of the workers were still getting use to the feel of the place but you really cant fault them for that!  This will be a place I return!  Thank you Potbelly for coming to the Valley of the Sun!

I went here on the 2nd day of business so I still think they are working out a few kinks.  I love the different options they have which make it stand out more than Chipotle.  I had the chile beef burrito enchilada style.  It was really good, it was so big I couldn't finish it.  The bf had a steak quesadilla which he loved and my friend had nachos which looked good.  There is stuff on the menu that I will return to try.  It looked like they hired about 100 people and had them all working!  It was kind of confusing at times but I am sure with time it will all get ironed out!  Good Job bringing something different to the area!

This place is really good!  The location is perfect and the atmosphere is really urban with a hipster feel to it.  We went during the week and it was semi-busy but we sat at the Pizza bar in front of the kitchen.  The guys in the kitchen were really nice and super talkative which was an added addition.  We ordered the Meatball pizza and the Cesar salad to share.  The salads are a big portion so you can share or have as an entree by itself.  The pizzas are also big enough to share.  The dough had a really good crisp texture and the toppings (cheese, sauce and meatballs) were really fresh and flavorful.  I cannot wait to come back and try some other items on the menu.  I have to agree that the waiters were not overly friendly, they were not rude but didn't go the extra mile to be friendly.  The guys in the kitchen rock though!

I was a little nervous trying Pho for the first time but I instantly fell in love.  I pretty much love soups in all form and Pho is no exception!  Pho 35 is close to work so I thought, why not try it.  It is in a strip mall but is pretty big inside.  The place is clean and the staff is really friendly.  I liked it so much that I am going to try it again!  Great flavors and the beef they use is really good too!

Not great at all!  If I could give this place a zero I would!  I ordered one thing and was given another and not even asked if they could replace with what I ordered when I took it back.  The chips are not even chips, they are like cinnamon pita chips.  I would not recommend this place at all!

I really, really liked this place.  It was big, clean and in a good location in regards to where I work.  The people were really friendly and greeted you right away.  I ordered the Chicken Pho and it was amazing!  The broth had a great flavor and really hit the spot.  They give you a lot of fixings (bean sprouts, jalapenos, etc).  I also tried the egg rolls and they were pretty good.  I am a fan and will return to try some of their other items!
