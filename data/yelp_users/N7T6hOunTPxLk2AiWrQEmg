I love this place.  Its really funny that we all live nearby or grew up nearby and never visited!  Ive driven by it about 5,000 times and never once went in.  Well they finally put up a sign advertising happy hour and wing specials, so I had to go.  Im a wing whore.  The inside was exactly as I had expected.  Old school cowboy bar.  They have a MASSIVE back patio for eating and smoking, complete with Horse Shoes.    Happy Hour is RETARDED CHEAP. Apps are normally $3-5.  Cut that in half. Bottles of domestics are $2. My Vodka Cranberries are like $4.  $5 personal pizza is huge, can easily feed 2 people.  Comes with 2 Toppings.  The wings are huge and delicious.  Well worth the $.30 each happy hour price!  I too have now been there about 30 times in the last 6 months.  It gets a 5-star rating because its everything I expected and a retardedly good deal.

Welp,  I'm back again.  It is.extremely hard to have an issue with this place.  Food is usually very good as far as bar food goes.  My girlfriend and I shared a dozen honey hot wings which were freakin delicious, a half dozen medium wings, and a bacon cheeseburger and a monster batch of fries.  Grand total - $17.84.  Had we been there on happy hour, it would've been $3 cheaper.  This place is an A+ in MY book.

These guys are awesome.  Super cool little ethnic grocery store inside as well as a great restaurant.  We've enjoyed several items on the menu and visited many times.  Service and food has always been great!

This place is definitely geared towards retirees and businessmen, but is very clean and well appointed.  The rates are competitive, as far as resorts go.  The room was extremely spacious and comfortable.  The bathroom was larger than my bedroom, complete with oversized standing shower, spa tub, and seperate toilet area.  Overall I was extremely pleased.

Been coming here since I was a little kid. Jimmy has cut my hair every 2 months for the last 15 years... good at what he does. Shampoo, hair cut, quick back massage for $16.

The Persian Room is excellent in all aspects.    The food is incredibly delicious, flavorful, and authentic.  The atmosphere is a little upscale, but you'll be just fine in a collared shirt and slacks.  As someone else mentioned, they make the pita bread in-house and it is absolute perfection.  This is one of the few places I happily spend more than $10 per person!  Im a cheapskate, and I LOVE the Persian Room.  I would recommend this for a first date, an anniversary, or just a nice dinner.

Slices poops all over other mall pizza places like Sbarro.  Excellent selection, probably upwards of 20 pizza options.    Oh, and who eats plain old boring cheese pizza?

Il Primo probably has the best wings Ive ever had.  I grew up on them and Ive been eating at Il Primo for over 20 years.    WIngs - excellent. Pizza - Pretty damn good. Pricing - a little pricey, but most wing places are Restaurant - dirty and lame.

Anyone saying anything positive about this place is either drunk, high, or both.    I am not a food expert or critic by any means, but I do eat a tremendous amount of pizza and wings.  The wings seemed like a great deal, and of course they're supposedly award-winning, so we got 2 dozen.  We ordered garlic parmesan and regular hot.  First and foremost, the wings are HALF the size of everyone else's wings.  What an extreme disappointment.  Both sauces were bland and boring.  The garlic parm was just a melted stick of butter and some sprinkles of garlic and parm.  The hot sauce was nothing more than a store-bought hot sauce.  All of the wings were way overcooked.  Oh you wanna hear about the pizza?  No, I assure you that you don't.  We ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza.  We received a big bag of d1cks.  It's not delivery, it's not Digiorno, it's Long Wongs :(  The crust was chewy and flavorless, the sausage was pathetic little balls of crap you find on $0.99 frozen pizzas.

This place is excellent.  I have probably eaten here 20 times.  One of my coworkers suggested we cater the office parties with their pizza.  There is no better site than 50 pizzas rolling in from these guys.

Absolutely less than impressed.    The burgers are expensive for what they are.  The drinks are pathetic at best.  They actual use pour meters!  That is so lame.  My vodka cran was $4.50, and usually that would be a good deal.  However there wasnt even a hint of alcohol in the drink.  Just a disappointing experience all together.  None of the four of us in my group were pleased.

I had a reservation for 8pm on a Friday night.  It was perfect.  The place was EMPTY so I had my choice of seating.  I picked a nice, dimly lit golf course view.    My girlfriend ordered the shrimp pesto and I ordered the fish and chips Friday special.  We also spent the big $2 on a cup of clam chowder, which was excellent.  Overall the meal was quite delicious.  Tip of the day - these guys are on restaurant.com!  Save some $$$!!!  Our total bill including 2 entrees and a desert was about $40.  We used our restaurant.com coupon which bought it down to like $22 out of pocket including gratuity!

We found Floyds right here on yelp, then found them again on restaurant.com!    I purchased the $25 off $35 coupon for $2... then found out they do happy hour all day on mondays, along with live music.  The music was good, the food was great, and my compound coupon/happy hour combo was freaking awesome.    Food:   artichoke spinach dip, Thai shrimp, and cajun bacon sandwich, along with a cookie.dessert.  The dip was a great app, served with tortilla chips and bread, and I don't even like the veggies.   The Thai shrimp was.good.   THE CAJUN CHICKEN AND BACON SANDWICH WAS PROBABLY THE BEST SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD.  I will definitely.recommend it to friends, and more than likely order it every time I visit from this point on.   The cookie and vanilla ice cream was an excellent finish to the meal.  It was HUGE and thick while most other cookies are large nd very thin.  This was the best 'pzookie' type cookie I've ever had.  FYI - the restaurant.com coupon CANNOT be combined with happy hour.  Luckily I'm a fat alcoholic so I got to use my.coupon on the food and happy hour discount on the drinks.  A+.... highly recommend Floyds and will be inviting friends and fam to go with me.

This place is fantastic.  The price per slice isnt bad at all, and they probably have 40 different pizza concoctions to select from.  It gets an A+ from me!

Aside from the overpowering odor of weed, pretty good experience.  I came in here all tensed up and defensive, waiting for a bullshit upsell.  To my surprise, it never came.  Maybe It's because they clubbed the lady in front of me like a baby seal.    In the end they offered a few upgraded packages but I didn't feel pressured at all.  $10 oil change was legit.

Epic fail.  11pm on a Friday and no one here.  The owner's kids are behind the bar monitoring bottles and acting like hot shots.  $8 for a $2 drink.  Empty dance floor.

This place is AWESOME. 1. Huge portions 2. Better value than other places like Filibertos or the other *.ertos restaurants. 3. Excellent quality food.  Vibrant and colorful veggies, fresh tortillas, delicious meats. 4. Friendly staff that understands your white boy questions and requests! 5. Clean restaurant! 6. SO FREAKIN GOOD.  My girlfriend and I visited for the first time about two weeks ago.  We've had TJ's probably 5 times together since, and I've gone a few times on my own or with coworkers.  The fish burrito and fish tacos are off the chain.  The breakfast burritos are killer.  I absolutely love the Carne Asada & Bacon burrito - LIKE CRACK!  I eat til I pop!

This place is terrible. No wonder they need to run a Groupon promo.  Staff busy talking on cell phones when we pulled up.  Cashier was a total twat.  Not worth the Groupon price. Surprised the car still has paint on it.

I found this place thanks to yelp.  Very... interesting!  I went for the Friday fish fry.  The fish was pretty good.  The ambiance was... interesting!  I can tell you that at 31 years old, I was probably the youngest customer by about 40 years.  But hey, it's Leisure World, right?  The place was PACKED with about a 30 minute wait, which I hear is pretty normal on Fish Friday.  Good service, good food.

Overall very nice first showing!  Drinks were cheap as hell and the place is NICELY RENOVATED.  Much more inviting and clean than Salty Senioritas.  See you there every Friday!

I purchased their Groupon last week.  Overall, I was very impressed with these guys.  The pizza was very good, and we got a small order of wings too.  The wings were large drumsticks, which were excellent.    I will be giving these guys another shot.  Their groupon worked!

Stuffrageous is great!  They keep running Groupon deals, and I feel like an asshole because I keep buying them.  It's great that you can call your order in ahead, or pay for it online - makes a lunch much quicker and easier!  I've had a few different burgers there, like the Pastrami burger and Italian with Pepperoni and Mozz, so damn good!  The fry sauce is excellent too.  (Even though I think it's just mayo and Sriracha!)  Very friendly and helpful staff, too.

Excellent opening day!  Very fast and friendly service.  The pizzas were great!  The crust was really good, which is important.    I built my own meatlovers style pizza with an alfredo sauce base, real mozzarella, shredded mozzarella, house recipe meatballs, spicy italian sausage, bacon, pepperoni, grilled chicken, black olives and mushrooms. It came out PERFECT.  The meats had great flavor and the fresh mozzarella was really nice.  My girlfriend made a pizza with a pesto base sauce, which she said was really good.  She also had a few different meats and lots of veggies.  She said hers was great as well.  We're both looking forward to leftovers!

This place is GREAT! We found it on Yelp and came in due to a few good reviews and being close to my office. The service was great - very friendly and welcoming. The restaurant was clean and spacious. The food was FANTASTIC! Large portions, great flavors, and excellent prices!

This place is great.  I never even knew it was a name brand, Cobblestone, until I finally.stopped in.    I have 22'' wheels on my car and I'm always terrified of scuffing them up at cheaper, ill-equipped car washes.  Cobblestone has padded rails to protect the wheel in the event it does make contact, and the track is wide enough to fit my fat tires.  They also have free vacuums, and even those pressurized air nozzles to blow.water out of seams and cracks!   Very well lit (great for detailing), clean restroom, quick, easy, cheap.
