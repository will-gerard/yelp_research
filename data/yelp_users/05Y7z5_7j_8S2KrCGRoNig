I brought in a pair of red suede Dolce Vita heels, with a rather large black scuff mark on the side of it, thinking there wasn't anything I could do to save them due to the color and material. However, Nerik proved me wrong and made them look almost brand new again. I was beyond impressed and completely satisfied with his work! I would highly recommend them for all your shoe and alteration needs! Thanks again Central Shoe Repair!

If you're looking for a stylist who is brave enough to conquer your crazy tresses, then this is the PERFECT salon for you!  After hours upon hours of reading Yelp reviews from other salons and even a trip to the infamous Toni & Guy salon, I have found my new favorite spot in the valley. After a letdown at T&G, I decided to call up Honeycomb and they got me in the same day! They can do all sorts of organic magic on your hair without fear, unlike other salons- cough T&G cough. I wanted to lighten and do a purple dip-dye/ombre on my hair and my stylist, Amra was able to do so without telling me to walk my butt to Hot Topic and buy temporary dye for her to put in for me... (Yeah, that really happened to me at Toni & Guy.. couldn't believe it!) Amra is the BEST for funky awesome color! We were able to achieve the look I wanted without killing my hair or my wallet. I've never been so happy with a hair salon visit in my life!  Highly recommend! Thanks Honeycomb!

You know what I hate about Rice Paper? Absolutely nothing.  The vegetarian pho(with Grandma's sauce) is my absolute favorite and the ambiance is great. Definitely one of my favorite spots for happy hour!

Worst tortilla soup I've ever had... but two stars for the free chips and salsa.

Not sure where the bad reviews are coming from... I ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp and it wasn't dry and it was full of flavor! Plus, the delivery was really quick! I will definitely keep ordering delivery from King Wong!
