My friend and I went over to get our nails done after work on a Saturday, they were busy told us to put our names in the book and what we wanted.  We did...then we were sat at a booth to look at nail colors to decide what we wanted, great we found them (but sat and waited for 20 minutes before anyone made contact with us).  My friend got taken back and wanted to get a full set put on, I just wanted a gel manicure, I had to wait an additional 45 minutes while 2 other people walked in stated they did not have appointments (but were taken right back and got started).  I was frustrated right off the bat, then after my friend asks if someone is going to help me and get my manicure done I have someone come over and they tried to tell me that I told them I was waiting for my friend to get done before I got my stuff done (that just doesn't make any sense).  While my friend has already been quoted $45 for her services one of the ladies that work there walks by and tells her that it is going to be an extra $10.00 (kind of hard to stop in the middle of everything being done...).  The girl who filed my nails was very nice, BUT the lady who was supposed to help me in the beginning acted as if I was a bother and I was an idiot because I asked for her to put glue on the tips of my nails to keep them from chipping.  After I am done the massage comes (which is everyone's favorite part)  it was like my four year old slapped lotion on my hands meanwhile the person doing this is complaining because she wants to go home.  I was in shock as I was paying I asked the gentleman to look at my nails because there were bubbles he told me no it was something stuck under the gel but it should be ok.  I paid my bill and left already having a not so great experience the worst part is 2 days later I am having the gel polish all chipped off and lifting, when I call to have the owner call me, he is never there and when he is there he doesn't call.  The lady that was rude to me on the day of my visit is who I ended up talking to again on the phone where she then told me she does not do refunds if I want it fixed I need to come back in, I do not want to go back in I was already treated horrible so why would I want to walk back in and put myself through that again?  At that point she told me that I can contact my bank then but she does not do refunds.  Needless to say I will not be going back and I have to pay another $30 to have my nails fixed...

I don't understand the point in making an appt if i have to way well past the time of my appt anyway!  I scheduled it so I could go to work and ended up being late.  Not to mention who likes going to have blood drawn but to walk in and have people that act like your a burden making them do their job doesn't help matters any.  Then I walk in the back to get the blood work done and it was such a cold attitude makes it impossible to not be nervous.  On a positive note didn't hurt to bad ;-)
