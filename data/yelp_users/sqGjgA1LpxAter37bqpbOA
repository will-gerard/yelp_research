Updated review: 2016  Still a wonderful vet. Dr. Kile is so great. We've been coming here for 11 years now. We have five cats and boy does it feel like it with the amount of times we have come in his year alone! For regular yearly shots to horrible, unfortunate visits they've covered it all with care to our cats and our wallets. We travel from Phoenix because we love it here so much. Never pressure to go forward with anything unnecessary. I'm not sure why there are negative reviews, misunderstandings shouldn't become negative reflections on businesses. If your in the area, or not this place is all around the best.

Wanted to like it because it's a stones throw away. However I ordered the Mac n cheese that looked and tasted so gross I had to return it. Came out in a perfect square, blazing hot (microwave hot) and was oozing grease, not fresh at all. Not only that but the service wasn't great, almost non existent. Didn't opt out for a replacement meal as my husband was not to keen on his dish either.

Would give zero. Only reason a friend and I came here was because its where Kevin Smith was performing. They pack you in like cattle. If you are in the middle of their long Jesus dinner tables like we were its especially bad if you have to pee. Two drink minimum is normal to expect from a comedy club but not putting the prices of their cocktails on the menu is a mistake, so be sure to ask unless you want an insanely over priced drink. Service was alright but they again run through you like an assembly line and were often non existent. Never coming back.

I'm going with five because I love sweet n sour chicken. Their chicken is always crispy and stays that way because they put the sauce on the side. Other dishes are good as well and the food is always consistent. The people that run and own this place are seriously the sweetest. Delivery can take a little bit longer than my stomach would like but pick up is much faster. Overall tried multiple places in the area and I keep ordering from here.

So far in my short time of having my medical card Bloom has been great. Pricing is better than a couple other places I've been and they have a large ever changing and adding variety of options. Friendly employees and the option to order online and pick up is awesome. Will continue to frequent here.

I hate working out, but this place does the trick. I've been coming for almost a year and it never gets old. They are always changing up the music and the themed nights are so much fun! The girls that work there are so nice. Being an uncool person they don't make me feel weird or unwelcome. In fact they are all so energetic and nice it makes up for the fact that I'm not and really gets me in the mood to not hate working out for the next fifty or so minutes. I come every week and will continue to do so!
