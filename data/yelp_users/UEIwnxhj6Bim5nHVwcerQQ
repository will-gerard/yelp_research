Love this office, I went to the Ahwatukee office and everyone was friendly and wonderful.  Dr Kristen Mayorga was great, made me feel very comfortable and received great patient care. Highly recommend this office!

I would give 0 starts if I could. Shawnte is one of the worst customer service reps I've delt with ever, even when comparing to fast food chains. This company was very difficult to deal with when it came to fixing things, be prepared to take care your own repairs. I've never had such a bad experience with a business before. Tip to any renters...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! Don't entertain them with your business.
