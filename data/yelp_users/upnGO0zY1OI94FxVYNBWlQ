Great service! These waitresses are on it. The food came right away. Such delicious selections:) my fav was crispy garlic shrimp and shrimp cakes on sugar car sticks. I live in LA so must find me a dim sum out here cause P.P.P got me yearning  for more can't wait to visit again.

The workers are suuuuuper accommodating and knowledgable about the menu but let's be real, the food is super greasy and served in what seems like a shit load of melted butter . It's really not as appetizing as it sounds. Yes butter is amazing but I'm not a huge fan of soggy food .      The floors were really sick, yuck !  The hot BBQ sauce is amaaaaazing though!  I would go back just for that. Everything else is whateva
