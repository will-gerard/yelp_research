I know it is difficult to be a vegetarian or a pescatarian at certain restaurants. Haus Murghy's is one of them.  They do have some vegetarian options, but almost all of them were carb-heavy. (I need my protein too!!) Their giant Bavarian pretzel was, er, giant. It was warm and delicious with mustard. Although I am a huge fan of sp√§tzle, the vegetarian version of Farmer Skillet (basically buttered noodles with some veggies) was rather bland compared to the gnocchi smothered in rich Gruyere cheese and wild mushroom sauce.  My dining companions ordered a wedge salad (a wedge of Iceberg lettuce = B-O-R-I-N-G), Caesar salad with grilled chicken (pretty good, so I was told), and bean soup (with hamburger meat).  The service was friendly, but I just wish they had given a bit more thought to fish/veggie options. (Or am I being ridiculous?)

I suggested we have lunch there because this restaurant was featured on the show: The Best Thing I ever Ate on Food Network,  The tattooed guy (owner) was SUPER friendly, helpful and patient. He seemed to be the only one working on the floor, but he didn't mind us wanting to sit outside (whereas everyone else was sitting inside) or asking questions about their cheese. We ordered a deep-fried bean burrito, tamale, and enchilada.  Both red and green salsas that we got with chips were awesome. The red one was a bit smokey and definitely had a kick to it. The green one was a bit tangier and not as intensely hot as the red.  Enchilada is usually not my favourite, but LDM's enchilada was smothered in a tasty enchilada sauce. The tamale was a bit dry, which was alleviated by having the delicious green sauce over it.  As my boyfriend put it perfectly, "being nice goes a long way". We enjoyed LDM not only for the food but the person behind it. Well done!
