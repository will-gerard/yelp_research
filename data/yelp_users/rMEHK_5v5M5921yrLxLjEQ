Absolutely the BEST Thai I've ever had in Arizona. The Tom Ka Gai soup was out of this world. A multitude of flavors exploding in your mouth! I went with a party of six and each of us loved our appetizers, soups and entrees.   I ordered the Vegetable Fried Rice and Green Basil Curry which were excellent. There's a little Thai place in Prescott, AZ that gives the Green Curry a run for it's money, but overall still great.   The service was wonderful as well - our waiter, Daniel, was friendly and gave us excellent service. This is a little gem of a restaurant in Old Town!

Maybe this was an off day for Los Favoritos... but whatever the case I won't be giving it a second chance. Because of all the raving reviews for their breakfast burritos we decided to try them. I have never had a burrito more gross than the one I ate this morning. Stale tortilla, greasy potatoes, bland flavor. Everything was bland; the salsa, guacamole, beans. We were both so disappointed. It was like eating a flavorless brick.  The customer service was subpar as well. The lady at the front counter was rude to us and wouldn't even offer a smile or greeting.   Again, maybe this was an off day but I was sorely disappointed. I want a burrito with flavor, freshness and excellent salsa. Phoenix, help me out- where does this exist??

I can't say enough how wonderful Dr. Berthiume and Dr. Marzke are. I've taken both of my pups there and enjoyed each visit. We recently moved to the Tempe area and was searching for a great vet. After stumbling upon reviews and ratings we chose Topaz and I'm truly thankful we have. I recently took my sick chihuahua in and Dr. Marzke was so gentle with her and thorough with her information. She even called to tell us the results of her xrays and wanted to check up on her directly. My pup is on the mend and I'm happy with the service we've received. Thank you Topaz for taking wonderful care of our furry kids!

I should've stopped at the salsa, which was strangely sweet. We tried two or three different flavors of salsa and it was like someone poured sugar in it. We went with our Canadian friends who loved it, although Canada is not a beacon for authentic Mexican food. My girlfriend and I were disappointed in the flavors of our food. While not inedible it was unauthentic. Definitely a "Meh, I've experience better."  For those with a mild and bland palette this may be for you, but it didn't appeal to me whatsoever.

Favorite brunch spot ever! If you're into something spicy try the Chiliquiles! SO GOOD!! Then when you want dessert try their Tsoynami. So good you won't miss dairy. Kudos NAMI and Green- excellent food.

I love this place!! My only complaint is I wish I lived closer!! I haven't had a thing I didn't like. One of my favorite guilty pleasures is their Chili Cheese Fries and Buffalo Wings. You must try them! Fresh salads and ingredients, they make being a vegetarian sinful!

Tried this place for the first time today and wow - the flavors were out of this world! I eat a mostly vegetarian diet - so I can't give you a good review on the meat, but the vegetarian bowl was bursting with flavor. There were so many options of fresh cooked veggies, hummus and toppings to choose from I was in Greek heaven! Think of this place as a hole in the wall Greek restaurant meets Chipotle style serving.   The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired and the signage was a bit confusing - something I really pay attention to being in the design industry. Yet all that being said, great food and friendly service. We'll be back!

Chef Johnny Chu is back at it again! I love this place! It's not your typical Thai restaurant - if you're looking for that I'm sure you can find one around. This place however is unique, delicious, serves excellent drinks and wonderful music.   Try their Lemongrass soup, it's a personal favorite.  It's rich in flavor and large enough to split or take leftovers for about $7! The Pad Thai is also great and honestly, I haven't had anything I didn't like at Red Thai. They offer a wide variety of martinis and cocktails which pair well with their in-house DJ on weekends.   If you're looking for flavorful food and an upbeat atmosphere for a date night or friend outing then this is the place for you!

I'm convinced all the good reviews are from people who are either drunk or have never had good food. My wife ordered the veggie omelet which was inedible - it actually tasted rancid or as she described like "chemicals". I ordered the Red Velvet Waffle which looked incredible but was completely burnt on the bottom side. When I asked the party of 8 that I was with how their food was they all responded... "Eh, it's ok."  I'd try them again for cocktails but I don't think their food will improve. Sorry Normal, your decor was the only thing winning!

Of the food selections to choose from at DeSoto Central Market, Adobo Dragon stood out to us so we gave it a try. My girlfriend and I split the Vegetarian Bento Box and weren't disappointed! The flavors were bold and complex - it's worth a try!

This afternoon was my first time trying The Coronado and I was so impressed. It's a small place with order at the counter style service- yet cute atmosphere.   We all got drinks, mine was their take on a Kentucky Mule (Whiskey, Ginger & Lime) which was just ok in my opinion. My fiancé got the Evergreen (Tequila, Serrano Peppers, Cucumber) and it was amazing- truly a delicious and different drink.  We started off with the street corn which was flavorful, crispy roasted outside and perfectly cooked. Then we shared the Potato Tacos which were excellent and bursting with flavor! Literally one of the best vegetarian dishes I've had in awhile. I want to try the cauliflower tacos next. My friends ordered the Jackfruit Sliders and Potato/Chickpea Burger and loved theirs as well.   Their prices are a little higher but the quality of the food was well worth it in my opinion. We love Green and Nami and this isn't a replacement for them, it's just another option with different flavors.   Well done Coronado!  I can't wait to try it again and hope it's just as good.

Furturo is quickly becoming one of my favorite coffee shops. It's not your typical coffee shop that's overdecorated and crammed with people on their laptops - but rather an artistic and minimalistic space that serves a handful of beverages and does them with excellence. I ordered the Cáscara, which is a tea brewed from the fruit of the coffee bean. WOW! I can't even quite describe it, it's unique and refreshing.   Looking for something new and different AND an excellent coffee? This is your place!
