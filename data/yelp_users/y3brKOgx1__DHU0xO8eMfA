I will never send flowers to my wife from this place on her birthday ever again!! When they delivered to our house they sent to the wrong address. Not only that, but when confronted they yelled at me for 5 minutes because THEY took the flowers to the wrong place. The flowers were decent but exaggerated when purchased on gloriasblossoms.com. Very disappointed.
