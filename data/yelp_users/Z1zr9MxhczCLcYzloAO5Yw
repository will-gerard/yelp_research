Online system says check in to reserve your spot.  I arrive 90 min later and they say check in doesn't matter.

Showed up with a vacuum that stopped working.  He took time to talk options, made sure to tell me I would not be charged for anything additional without approval first, and when he was done working on my vacuum it looked brand new. Honest company that I will continue to do business with.

In the middle of a crowded UFC fight, the staff and management took time to make sure my wife and I had an awesome time. The food was great, the drinks were made delicious...we had plenty...and the service was phenomenal. I strongly recommend Majerle's!

This is by far the best GNC I've ever been to.  Friendly staff who know what they are talking about. I have been there at least 10 times and they always provide exceptional service.

Hey said they offer no VIP seating and to show up early for best seats, yet half the place was reserved. Service was AWEFUL!  Waited 28 min for first drink and another 25 min for second!  There are better comedy clubs!  Heck, you could drive from Scottsdale to Tempe and get drinks faster!  Can I rate 0 stars?
