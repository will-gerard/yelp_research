I have been going to Nicole Williams at Steven Paul Salon for the last five years and she is great. She takes the time to get to know her customers and listens to what you want. She will also be honest with you when you ask her for something she knows will not flatter your face.   I have sent 3 friends to her and they are all return customers. I have had her both cut and color my hair. I would highly recommend her!

We went for happy hour and were pleasantly surprised. They have a $2.95 food menu for happy hour and the options were very good. I had the Margarita flatbread and my companion had the Angus burger. Both tasted great. The burger, although on a $2.95 menu is a full size burger cut into 4 pieces. I also had a mojito which was very good, although this can easily vary by bartender.

Let me start off by saying I really wanted to like this place. It was warm and welcoming as soon as I walked in the door. I called on a Saturday morning and was able to get in that day for a 4 pm appointment with Sherri. Sherri was running a behind and was kind enough to call me and let me know to come in at 4:15 pm. It was much appreciated! These are the two reasons I'm giving 2 stars.   I came to the salon with shellac (or gel as it's also now called) on my nails. Once the old shellac was removed from my nails, Sherri did a quick buff and immediately started applying the new primer coat. I stopped her and asked if she was going to clean up my cuticles, she told me she does them after she polishes them. She then polished them and did a quick glance and my cuticles and defined them as "no cleaning up necessary". I was thoroughly disappointed. I had to go home and actually use my own nail clipper to remove a started hang nail.   To top it off, after I got home I noticed there were little bubbles or bumps in my nails. I didn't think you could get these from shellac, but obviously you can! It all just felt very amateur, not the professional experience I went in for. I've attached a picture of my nails.

We went here for lunch and were surprised to find it more of a fast food type versus a regular restaurant. You order your burger at the counter and they bring it to your table. I ordered the veggie burger and sweet potato fries. I found both to be very flavorful and tasty. The veggie burger tasted homemade and came with roasted red peppers and avocado. There was definitely substance to this veggie burger! The sweet potato fries were some of the best i've had. Very crispy and fresh.

My fiancé and I went into minibar ber shop today and he got an amazing cut from Jackie. My fiancé has had the same haircut for years and he was looking for something new. Jackie took the time to talk with him about what he wanted and then provided advice about what to do going forward. The place is very modern looking and had lots of fun trinkets you could buy for gifts. He will definitely be going back.

The prepared foods bar at this Whole Foods is incredible. I travel all over Northern California for business and eat at Whole Foods usually 3-4 times a week. This location has many hot vegetarian options (think quinoa, sautéed kale, bean salads) along with meat items (white fish, chicken wings, ribs, etc).  I highly recommend for lunch or an easy dinner. Tons of seating options downstairs, upstairs, or outside.

Food was very flavorful and I was not disappointed by the portion size as others have commented on.   Highly recommend taking some time and visiting Flower Child. Fox has hit the nail on the head again with this one!   Notes:  - You stand in line to order and then chose a seat to have your food brought to you.  - Servers are standing around the line looking to help and answer questions on the menu while you wait.  - Very open atmosphere and pleasant experience while waiting.   Food:  + Avocado Kale Salad was much larger than I anticipated. The dressing was sweet but balanced wonderfully with the bitterness of the kale. You could possibly use less dressing, although I didn't find that to bother me too much.  + Mix & Match:   + Roasted veggies were very well done and melted in your mouth. More carrots than anything.   - Dark greens were less flavorful and somewhat bitter.   - Beet/Citrus/Avocado is a must if you like beets. The combination pairs incredibly well together!
