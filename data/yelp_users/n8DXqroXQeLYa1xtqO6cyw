The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is this place is the hole in the wall.  Pretty much the hole was made by a wrecking ball.  The food is awesome and and very tasty and authentic.  Don't expect too much on view.

INVASION OF PRIVACY.  As soon as the clerk heard that I live in Phoenix he wanted my proof of insurance for the car that I personally own.  For what I naturally responded?  It's none of your business.  Reluctantly I gave him my car insurance card.  That was not enough!!! They wanted to know how much I pay, deductible, liability and etc.   I had ordered my rental car online and already bought and paid for their stupid insurance.

I was in North Phoenix for a friend's birthday.  This place was choose by one of our mutual friends.  This place is very authentic!!!  The help speaks Cantonese! (and English) and were very helpful in their recommendations.  I would go back if I lived up there.

I ate lots of pho in my lifetime.   For a healthy guy with a strong meat apatite, I found the meat in the pho was less than other places.  But surprising I like the texture of the noodles.  Yay! noodles

I been going to this place for years now.  Its the same lady we see when my friends and I come.  (she sometimes ask how my mom is doing, but I didn't know she knew my mom until recently1!)  Anyways, the food is just like how my mom used to make it when I was a kid.  Pretty cool!

I probably gave this place an extra star because I'm comparing it to the last budget car rental place.   I was able to get a Toyota Camry, (great gas mileage) but it was a little dirty, but that's what you get for a budget place.   I'm Asian so I look like I'm 20 when I'm actual 36.  The last car rental place assumed I was under 25 and tried to charge me more. The girl at this place actual looked at my driver license and  didn't spew me any bs about the insurance, gas fill ups or extra add on and just treated me with respect and is simply honest.    I recommend this place but please remember this is a budget category.

I'm not Malaysian or an expert at this food and this is the first time I been to this restaurant.  As soon as I walked in the door a small Asian girl with the biggest smile on her face greeted me at the door.  -- "Thats pretty dope" I thought to my self.  The food wasn't bad either, it was actually pretty good.

I like this place.  When I want noodle soup I used to go to pho place.  This is a great alternative to pho.  I read a review of some "expert" guy saying this is pho and comparing it to pho, well the joke is on you because it's not pho. Did I say this is noodle soup and not pho? . Come on everyone Asian knows that.
