I texted for appointment and got a response right away, I was there, in and out  in less than 15 minutes! It was well worth my 18 mile drive, knowing that the pictures are taken with the end result in mind, helps me scratch one more thing from my list. Very nice and professional gentleman, will refer others!

I love Brushfire! I go there on the regular for breakfast burritos and tacos! It's the bomb! sometimes I roll there for a light 1 taco, rice and beans dinner and then get a Redbox to unwind. Sometimes when I show up to work w/ my brown bag breakfast from Brushfire, I be like "This some good gourmet s*#t right here!!...go get you Sum!"  - Fo real :D

I cannot recommend this store to anyone I care for, with the experience in service I received. Very misleading. This is not a true Verizon store but a "4G wireless" store, meaning that they CAN and WILL sell you a phone for as much as they can get away with and tell you that "this phone comes with such and such items" and end up SELLING then to you in the process, telling you that the phone you are inquiring about WILL COST $273 dollars....in other words: the phone is $0 out of pocket MR.CUSTOMER but I'M UPSELLIN you these UNNECESSARY and UPMARKED ACCESSORIES in the process making you think that it's the cost of getting the phone. And don't worry MR.CUSTOMER, you have 14 days to exchange the GALAXY for an IPHONE if you prefer but I won't tell you that those ACCESSORIES that "COME WITH THE PHONE" , I charged you for and are NON-REFUNDABLE and useless for your Iphone since you might end up trading the GALAXY.  Here MR.CUSTOMER, sign this little electronic pad that tells you, you are "receiving these items"  A.K.A. buying these non-refundable items in this transaction.  ......Very Very SHADY. This store is no better than a Kiosk at the mall. AVOID and go to a TRUE VERIZON store. I'm sure I'm not the first nor will be the last to get wacked by this awful misrepresented excuse of a wireless store. Verizon as a company is great, but stores like this, give the company a bad name, BEWARE. I wish someone had written a review like this before I was sold over $200 of  unnecessary accessories in the transaction.  Sir, welcome to Verizon wireless, the "4G Wirelss" Way! ...... Pshhh
