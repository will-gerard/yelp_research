Best Deli in the valley! Best corned beef and pastrami I've had in AZ. Like a Deli straight out of New York. Make sure you go Hungry because the portions are very big!

A hybrid of a Calzone and a glorified Hot Pocket, Stuffed with some of the most amazing combos of food you could think of! you could go here for lunch everyday for months and never get the same thing and be just as happy every time! Wouldn't go at lunch time though, it's out of control busy!! Great selection of alcohol as well. TWO THUMBS UP!

Best breakfast in the valley. The one downside is long long wait times, but the food is worth it! Friendly servers as well.

Friendly service. Got the fajitas. They were pretty bland. We got the fried ice cream for desert. It was either not fried or not fried this century. It was rock solid and was almost impossible to eat. All in all I would not return here.

Hands down the Best coffee I've ever had! I know, strange for a comic book store. Seriously, stop in and try the coffee, it will ruin all other coffee for you!  This is also an amazing comic book store. It's clean, inviting, fairly priced, lots of Doctor Who merchandise and they even have Doctor Who night every Tuesday from 6 to 9!   The back has an AMAZING game room. A row of cumfy chairs and a row of TVs where you can hang out and play all the newest games online or off.  The owners are very nice and very welcoming.   This, in my opinion, is the best comic shop in the valley! Check it out!!

This dunks is by my house. They have not been able to make breakfast sandwiches for over 2 months due to a broken oven. This is the strangest thin I've ever seen from a dunks ever. People come in all day ordering breakfast just to be told the ovens broken. Will they ever fix it or do we have a case of EXTREME laziness.

Hands down the best decision I've ever made. I don't feel like I'm paying for someone to help with my finances, I feel like we've gained a friend that truly cares for our well being. Kelsa has stopped the money war in our household and gave us a chance to enjoy our marriage and not have any real stress that comes with two people that are horrible at managing money. Thanks Fiscal Fitness! You've given us more than money could ever buy.

I used Weather Masters and the Tech that came was very friendly and knowledgable. They fixed my issue and advised on what may be needed for the future. I can't recommend them enough!!

I came here with four people. I didn't have silverware. I asked 3 different people for a fork. We went the whole meal with no silverware. I finally ended up eating alone after an hour with no fork because my 2 year old wouldn't sit still while we waited for a fork. I spoke to the manager and he didn't really care but gave me a fork. Still charged us full price for everything. Nice. Real nice.i can't believe this place is still open. I'll never come back.
