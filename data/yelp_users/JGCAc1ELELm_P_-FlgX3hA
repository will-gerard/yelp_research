My dog loves coming here, and I've never had less than a completely pleasant experience with the staff and the services.  The reception area is clean and they are quick to get you signed in. There's a Keurig machine for use while you wait, which is never long.  You and your pet are brought into an exam room where they go over the reason for the visit, a few questions about your pet's diet and any changes in behavior, and what charges to expect. They do take your pet to another room for some tests and services. During my first visit showed me this room so I didn't sit there imagining they carted my dog off to a hidden pet dungeon. When they return they go over what they did, what your charges are (again!) and any follow up information you need to know.  They are timely with test results and stay on top of when your pet is due for vaccinations. I got my money's worth with a PAW plan, and loved the training class I took there with my pup (as did she!).   They might be a little heavy-handed with the treats, but hey, a dog that is excited for her appointments is worth it!

Hooray! I may have found my dish here!  I came back on a Friday night at dinnertime. The weird, empty atmosphere was replaced with the chatter of other tables and several bustling waitstaff.  For appetizers we ordered egg rolls and fried wontons. Not the highlight of the meal, but they were pretty cheap, so whatever.  For my meal I ordered a spicy chicken dish and added vegetables because I can't just eat a plate of saucy fried food without something healthy. This meant my dish was pretty expensive, but it was 2 meals worth, so worth it. The chicken was perfectly crunchy on the outside, tender inside, and the vegetables were still a little crunchy and a good mix. Ordering it at heat level 6 was perfect for me, though I ate around a few jalape√±os because it would have kicked it up to an 8.  The servers were very attentive, and my water glass was always full. The lady who sat us and brought the food was like a fussy mother, in a good way, as she rearranged the plates and glasses to make more food fit on the table.  It was so good, I boxed half of it up so I wouldn't look like a pig, then I finished it as soon as I got home.

They quoted me 15 minutes, and just 10 minutes later called my name to say it was done. Quickest oil change I've ever had.  Paid $38 and some change with the $5 off Ladies' Wednesday discount.

Service can make or break a business, and in this instance, it totally made the difference.  Coffee was piping hot and fresh. The waitress was pleasant and checked in on us. The food was good. Nothing spectacular, but satisfying.   However, one in our party had a problem in the kitchen with his breakfast and, as a result, had his food come out last. Instead of being freshly made, his food was lukewarm. Already having to wait, he ate his breakfast and didn't mention it to the waitress.  When it came time to pay, the man at the register asked how everything was and we mentioned it was just ok, and that one person didn't have a hot breakfast. He said that since we weren't completely happy, he took that meal off the bill! We were all pretty surprised at this display of customer service, since we weren't even looking to complain.   I also noticed they had coffee and iced tea available outside near the front door for people waiting to be seated. It's a nice gesture that says they care about making people happy.

Don't come here with me if you're embarrassed by people stuffing their faces. Fair warning!  I don't know how fast I scarfed down my grilled chicken, hummus, baba ganouj and tabbouleh, but I may have set some type of record. The chicken was so tender and juicy! And I'm kind of like the Goldilocks of hummus, (This hummus is too gritty! This hummus is too lemony!) but theirs was perfectly balanced.  I loooove baklava, but theirs is lacking, so I knocked off a point for that, and because their beverage game is weak, but as long as I can get my food fix, I'll keep coming back.

I've been going here since I was a wee lass and over the years not much has changed.  The service is always polite, the hot tea is always piping hot, the wonton chips are always delightfully greasy, and the food is always tasty and plentiful.  It seems they always have coupons in the local mailers for 15% off.   Do like I do--place a phone order for a mountain of food, take it home and watch bad movies. Hahaha! You thought all that food was for a family?! Boy, I sure pulled one over on you.

Ignore the fact that the interior design looks like it hasn't been updated in over a decade, this is my go-to breakfast joint.   The best way I've found to have breakfast here is to come with a partner or two, order a few plates (California Eggs Benny, Southwest Carnitas, and maybe some Cinnamon Swirl French Toast) and gorge yourself on a little bit of everything.  I've been meaning to try some desserts, but after all that breakfast and a pot of coffee, I don't have the room!

There was a time in my life when I was coming here every week with my mom.  I probably still would be if we lived here, but we moved from Peoria in 2005.  (Yeah, I've been going for years and it's always been consistently good.)  But even though it's been a several years since we were regulars, our server Andrew still remembers us and can bring us our drinks before we even order.  They've got the salsa down.  I could eat a bucket of the stuff.  I don't know what makes it so special, but it's my favorite salsa ever.  Perfectly thin, crispy chips that aren't greasy.  And they aren't stingy with refills.  My favorite item (my favorite food, PERIOD) is the Pollo Especial.  Shredded chicken and green chiles fried in a tortilla, then smothered in jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar.  Sounds simple, but anytime I've gotten a similar item elsewhere, it doesn't hit the mark.  If you get this at dinner it's a lot of food.  The lunch sized version suits me just fine.  Can't say how their dessert is.  I've always been too full to try.

I decide since it's been over a year since my last haircut, it's time for an update. I want to get it all--cut, color, highlights. I call, make an appointment for Saturday before a planned girls' night so I can wow everyone, everything is swell so far.  Before we get started she asks the requisite questions, and I point out to her what colors I'm going for. The most important point I make is that I want my highlights to look natural. Just to say it another way, I say flat out, NO BLONDE STREAKS. I also mention my hair is naturally curly, and I never straighten it.  Let's fast forward past the part where she's putting in the foils, chit chatting about how she and her husband love Red Lobster, blah blah, typical salon blather.  At this point some woman comes and rudely asks if Angel can see her now, without an appointment. Instead of saying, "I'm with a customer right now, we can make an appointment or you can come back when I'm finished," she says, "just give me 15 minutes."  Wait. What.  Then Angel starts the color. As she's putting in the color, I can feel she's kind of just slopping it on. It's in my ears, across my forehead, all down my neck. I'm starting to worry, but I'm like hey, maybe she's just making sure it's saturated, she'll make sure she gets it off all my skin, she's a professional. Right?  Apparently not. When it's time to rinse, another stylist at the salon walks by, sees me, and goes, "Oh...Angel..." with a grimace. Now I'm mortified. Angel brushes it off, blames the showercap she had me wear for the color all over my face. She starts scrubbing at my skin like mad with this liquid meant to get off color stains, but it's not working in the slightest.  Then the other woman offers a suggestion...let's rub some cigarette ashes on it!  WAIT. WHAT.  She goes on to explain the situation is so dire, the only thing that will help at this point is cigarette ashes, a trick she learned in beauty school.  So I wish I was joking, but they went outside to the ashtray, got some cigarette ashes and began scrubbing my face with them.  Once my face is raw, they give up and put me in front of a mirror for the first time and I am too furious for words.  Not only is my skin dyed so I look like I had some horrible encounter where the sun NESTED ON MY HEAD and gave me a disease, but I've got these nasty blonde streaks all over and I look like I'm trying to go to Comic-Con as Rogue.  Now the woman who barged in earlier is back, this with a styrofoam box of some really smelly food, and she's sitting right behind me offering up nuggets of wisdom such as, "you don't look very happy. At least you can be grateful, knowing you were happy with what you had before!"  Angel starts combing through it and asks me what I think. "I don't like it," is all I can come up with. She tells me I just need to take some time, get used to it, she thinks it's beautiful.  I'm seething about the tacky blonde stripes, so she finally offers me a "solution."  She can tint it for me for an extra $20!  Unhappy is an understatement, so she hurries through the cut (or maybe she's hurrying because she promised Eating Woman Full of Knowledge that she'd see her 20 minutes ago?). Then she blow dries it out straight, something I also mentioned at the beginning as I never straighten my hair. All the while telling me how pretty it turned out.  I had plans for the evening, I can't go anywhere two inches of my forehead and the top half of my ears dyed bright red!  "Just go home, wash your face, put some makeup over it. In 2 days you, won't even know."  All sorts of comments not appropriate for general audiences go here. Fill in the blanks.

I went here, not because I was looking for a particular type of soda, not even because I drink a lot of soda, but just to see what it was all about.  What a found was a tiny little store the size of a shed jam-packed with the craziest assortment of beverages I'd ever seen.  (Okay, maybe it just seemed that small because it was so full of stuff!)  In boxes on the floor, on shelves, in the coolers, sodas in every color, of every type.  My friend and I both picked out a few bottles, trying to get a good assortment of old and new, different flavors and colors, but really it would take me a few years to try everything here.  I grabbed a few that seemed especially unique and funny to give as gifts to co-workers.  Just go here to do something different.  Yes, you can go to Circle K or QT and get a giant fountain drink for around a dollar, but that's not what this shop is about.  Go here to remember that there was a time when your drink choices weren't just Coke vs. Pepsi.  You just might be pleasantly surprised.

I love this place. Yes, it is always busy and no, it is not easy to find parking, but I don't care. I don't come here to have a quiet evening, and I don't come here to be astounded by ambiance and lavishly decorated plates. I don't even drink--I come here for the food!  Everything I've tried here, I've liked. Everyone will tell you how great the beer fries are (and they really are!) but I have trouble deciding between the fries and the awesome pasta salad.  This isn't some crap pasta salad you eat at a picnic, this is good food.  The wide selection of beers is just the icing on the cake on top of a solid restaurant.  Service is always friendly, no matter how busy and loud it gets, and they're always there to get you another drink.

"Greasy spoons" are called such for a reason, but when you have a pool of that yellow margarine stuff under your hash brown, it's too much.  The biscuits and gravy were no better than the ones at Whataburger, and the eggs are definitely not fresh eggs.  But the biggest letdown of all was the coffee, which was several hours old. I've had baths hotter than this.  The only saving grace was the very pleasant and attentive servers, who (bless them) kept offering coffee refills.

This place is awesome. I spend an entire day walking around vintage stores in the area, and this place has the best stuff and the most reasonable prices.   I got a 60s couch for $300 bucks. Can't beat that with a stick.

Hmm, some time has gone by since I first tried their cupcakes. Maybe I should have another visit to refresh my memory?  Okay, that's really just a clever ploy to eat more cupcakes.  But let's be honest: you know when you step out of your car into a tiny, gritty parking lot in Phoenix and you are smacked upside the head with the smell of CHOCOLATE! WARM BAKING CHOCOLATE! instead of pollution and hot garbage bins, you are in for a real treat.  The man working behind the counter that afternoon was very patient as my friend and I wondered googly-eyed at case of goodies. After an embarrassingly long time spent deciding, I walked out of there with a half-dozen differently flavored caloric little angels.  While each cake was moist with the right balance of fluffy to crumby, topped with a generous amount of frosting, the highlights for me were the Mexican Chocolate (rich, warm, and spicy) and Orange Blossom (bright, floral, and citrusy).  As if taste alone isn't enough to go by, this place uses lots of local and organic ingredients and somehow still manages to beat out other shops in price per cake!

Big groups are hard to take care of, and when you're out with a party of about 15, you expect a few sides of of dressing, or maybe the request for no cheese on the sandwich, to be forgotten. No big deal.  But when 2 people in the party are forgotten completely and no effort is made to make them happy, that is a big deal. The manager even came out and asked if everything was fine, and when we pointed out 2 people were missing their meals, the manager said "I'll go check on that" and was not seen again for the rest of the evening.  The food itself was fine, but there's no much the kitchen can do when they don't receive the order.  The next day one of the party checked her statement and found she had been charged for 2 different bills. When she called to get it corrected, the manager told her "oh, they rang you up wrong but I told the waiter to let you know we reversed the charge." No responsibility taken.   Next time the office has a reason to celebrate, we know this is not the place.

My stomach grumbles every time I think of their cheese calzone.  Mostly because it makes me hungry thinking about it, but partially because my stomach hates me after I devour that much cheese.  And I even split that beast in half and share it with someone else!  Seriously. That golden-brown top brushed with butter and garlic. That combination of mozzarella and sweet ricotta cheese...it's carb heaven.  Let's not mention that I start with their spinach & artichoke dip every time.  Served with a hot crunchy/chewy pizza crust with a light layer of melted cheese and garlic.  Sprinkle some crushed red pepper on it and I would eat that entire thing myself if I could, even though it's probably meant to be an appetizer for around 4 people.  The other locations I've been to in Chandler and Avondale always have more patrons, but the food is the same--I need a gurney to get out of there.

Just walking to the front door got me excited; there are outside picnic benches so your ankle-biters can run around out there and not bother me as I dine inside!  Woo hoo!  I had imagined more of a sit-down & order kind of place, but I support ordering and picking up your food at the counter so there aren't waitstaff hovering around.  (Nothing against waiters, I just prefer a more casual environment!)  And casual, inviting atmosphere they have.  The young lady working the register was one of the nicest people I've ever interacted with.  The food was exactly what I hoped for: fresh and flavorful.  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad, with tasty mixed greens, roasted poblano peppers, and lots of other good stuff mixed in.  Sure, my food was ready fast, but this isn't your typical fast food pile of iceburg lettuce!  If you have time afterward (and it's not too hot), take a stroll around the place, admire the flowers and plants, maybe even pick up some fruits for veggies they have for sale out back!  It's on the honor system!

A shop filled with things I want but don't need? If it's wrong to spend time here, I don't want to be right.  It's not big, it doesn't have a ton of stuff, but it works. Instead of feeling overwhelmed by things to look at, I can take my time looking over everything.  And by some form of wizardry, everything in this store turns out to be something I want.  Great place to take someone when you've got a birthday coming up so you can point out all the things you wouldn't buy yourself.

At Sprinkles they are all about clean, minimalistic design in their store, as well as on their cupcakes.  Nothing over-the-top, not too "girly," just an understated cupcake in a quietly upscale cupcake boutique.  Like a classic BMW, it's not overtly flashy, it doesn't have gold rims or space-age lines, but it holds the expectation of luxury.   This is what you're paying for--the image.  Unfortunately, image is all your money buys you here. Judging by the amount of business they have, that is good enough for many.   I tried several flavors, but never once felt like the calories were worth eating the whole thing.  The cakes themselves are dry and bland, crumbling and making quite a mess.  Topped with an inadequate amount of equally bland icings that had hardened into a shell on the outside (how long had these been sitting around? I tried them right outside the store!), many of them finished with an inedible circle of what may be candy.  A luxurious cupcake this was not.  I felt duped, but I learned my lesson and I won't be making the same mistake again.  Cupcakes are meant to be ingested, not flaunted.

All I had was the Pizza Bianca, so while I don't know much about this place, I do know this:  - CHEWY CHEWY CRUST. In my opinion, an awesome thing. Pizza crust should not be a cracker, nor should it be a slice of white bread.  - HOT AS BLAZES. Like, that thing flew out of the oven.  - GARLIC! I really enjoy garlic, and I'm guessing they do, too.  ...and most importantly: I will return!

I love trying out new places with a group of people who also love trying new places! Sample ALL THE BEERS! Stick your fork in ALL THE DISHES!  The beers are good, with a wide selection that you can probably find one for everyone (as long as they like beer). (I had cider, because I don't care for beer.)  I'm going to be honest: as an Arizona native who spent time in Texas, I get really excited by Southwest-inspired brewpub food, and having multiple options with brisket gets me in a tizzy.  I opted for the Texican, a massive brisket and bbq quesadilla. I shared that with my sister, who had the Texas Beef Dip, and her fianc√©, who got the San Antonio Mac n Cheese (TEXAAAAAS). My quesadilla was the favorite of the table, with the smoky, sweet, and gooey flavor combining into a vortex of goodness. The beef dip could have used a bit more heat, so I added some jalape√±os from my plate to the sandwich and made it better. The mac and cheese was good, but I think would have been better as a side and not a full entr√©e.  Despite the apparent popularity of the place, the service was not lacking and the wait time wasn't an issue until it was time to get the check and some pointed staring had to be done. (Yes, we are all trying to communicate with you telepathically our will to pay and move on with the day.)  There are other menu items I wanted to try, so I'll be back. And I signed up for the mailing list, so I'll probably have a coupon. Aww yeah.

The yogurt is consistently good. Some places you'll get a runny batch, or a batch that doesn't taste as amazing as the first time...not here. Taro is my favorite, but the rotating flavors keep it interesting.   If you like toppings, they've got you covered (pun intended). Me, I'm a purist, but sometimes the strawberries and kiwis call to me.  If only they were as consistent with the people who work here! Some of them you'll see wiping down spills, tables, windows, and other times you can't find a place to sit that isn't sticky while the employee behind the counter is busy texting!

Their gelato is like my dream guy, rich and super smooth.  And cold. And creamy. Sometimes nutty or fruity.  Wait, this is becoming a terrible analogy.  Just go try it. You'll swear off ice cream forever.

Ohhoho man, I love America.  I gathered two of my other, uh, "rubenesque" ladies to try this place for the first time. I wanted almost everything on the menu, so the best option was obviously the Lolo's Famous SoulFood Platter. There are a few ways to get it, but I did mine with the chicken fried chicken smothered in sausage gravy white sausage gravy (loaded with "flavor" they say), mac & cheese, string beans and potatoes.  Sure, I probably had more than my share of fat and salt for the week, but I enjoyed it! The chicken was the star, juicy and crispy, and there was so much sausage in the gravy, even I was stunned. The mac & cheese was good as well, so cheesy that I couldn't manage more than a couple bites (gotta save room for the chicken!). The green beans and potatoes were there to make me feel like I ordered a vegetable, but weren't very good, and the cornbread was dry.  I tried a bite of my friend's waffle, and even though I've never cared for waffles, I enjoyed it.  Despite what many reviewers noted as a lack of or just bad service, we were all happy with our waiter and didn't have to wait overly long for our food.

Popped in here because a friend and I were looking for some place to hang out and chat after dinner, and I'm so glad I found it! It's like it's specifically designed to make you want to get comfortable and chill for a while. It's not a large space, but we found a booth and enjoyed our drinks and a shared square of cheesecake with lemon custard. I had a raspberry mocha, which was nicely bittersweet, and she finished her large coffee in record time. The coffee really helped cut the richness and sweetness of the cheesecake, which was a bit much for my taste.   The girl working the counter was super amiable, and offered suggestions when we were staring at the menu board in a stupor.  The thing I think could improve my visit are the bathrooms, which weren't messy, but need some TLC.

One rock thrown by a semi on the freeway + one cold night = 3ft. long crack right across the driver's side. FanTAStic.  Called the number and the line was busy. Not five minutes later I got a call back. He said something about Chinese glass (and I just went "uh-huh, ok"), and quoted me a price and we set up a time for a tech to come to my apartment.  The tech, Freddie, called when he was about 10 minutes away to give me a head's-up. He was polite, got it done in the estimated time, and was on his way.  Since then I've heard several more rocks bash against my windshield, but no chips or cracks. Woohoo!

For all those times when a pile of meat and bread just won't do, I come here.  Cashew chicken wraps or eggrolls as an appetizer, with Tofu Thai Basil or the green curry are the stuff my dreams are made of. Make 'em extra spicy!  Ok, so maybe the vegetables are the same no matter what dish you get. But that's fine with me, I like them all!  The service has always been polite and attentive every time I've been here.

I've been coming here for pedicures for while now, and never experienced a problem. They are clean, professional, and do a thorough job of scrubbing away the callouses on my yeti feet.  Andy can be pretty funny if you mess with him, but they don't try to force conversation. I like that I can just sit back in the massage chair and watch some Storage Wars (it's somehow always on!) or play games on my phone while I wait for the transformation to my new, soft, baby feet.

I am plump. Rotund. Chubby, tubby, roly-poly, or, to borrow a word from comedian Gabriel Iglesias, I'm a "fluffy" kinda girl.  And yet, just one of these cupcakes had me thinking, "not worth the calories." Even after I'd scraped off half of the mountain of icing.   It wasn't because of the filling, though I eyed it with some skepticism (I hate filled donuts, custard, pudding, anything goopy). I actually thought the filling on my Tropical Vacation cupcake was the only saving grace. It was slightly runny, but flavorful. The cake itself was...sticky? tacky? lacked depth of flavor and suggested the use of colorants. The frosting outweighed the cake and was much too sugary for my taste.  Even if these were cheaper than their $3.50/cupcake price tag, I still wouldn't be frequenting this place.

It's cute, it's clean, it's awesome when the weather is nice, the guy working when I went in cracked a joke or two.   No contest, sweetest frozen yogurt I've ever tried. Maybe that's a good thing if you're an ice cream junkie, but I missed the natural yogurty tang in the flavors and had to stick with plain ol' tart.

Yeah, it sucks that they don't allow substitutions. I'm not going to argue that.  But the food is quality, and the choices are not your standard breakfast-joint fare. Come here because it is something different, not because you want the usual!

My mom watches a lot of Food Network. Why does that matter? Because any time I want to have a food adventure, she's down. I call her up, say we're going to a new pizza place, and it's go time.  We came here at that weird period on a weekday between lunch and dinner, so there was literally only one other customer in the restaurant. Nice! Where I used to feel awkward being in a mostly empty establishment, I've learned there are some great things about it.  1) I can check the place out without people being all up in my way. First impression is this place is aesthetically pleasing, and there's quite a bit of attention to detail. I can see why "hipsters" are drawn here. More importantly, everything looked shiny and clean.  2) I get to see how the the place runs when everyone's not "on." You know what I mean. Things are different when it isn't showtime.   Though I'm not a big meat-eater, we went for the meatball trio and the side of beets to start.   The meatballs were awesome, flavorful, and the perfect texture, and the marinara was right on. The real star of the dish was the polenta, with a perfect crunch on the outside and creamy inside. There was a bit of fork-shoving to get the last of it.  Beets and pears are a great combination, but we both felt like it was lacking something until we snagged a bottle of balsamic vinegar.   For the pizza we shared the margherita with added roasted garlic (our server's favorite as well, what a coinkidink!). The crust was unlike any I've had before. Not at all chewy, light and airy with a nice crispiness without being like a cracker. I really enjoyed it.  I would have loved to try the wine coolers, but $8? Come on.  After all that goodness, I didn't have room to try the cobbler. The great news is, they have a drive-thru, so I'll get my chance!

I feel like Will Ferrell in Elf on seeing the sign for World's Best Cup of Coffee: "You did it! Congratulations! World's best cup of coffee! Great job, everybody!"  And really, the Voted Best Sandwich in America sign is just like that.  It wasn't busy, but the girl at the counter seemed to be struggling. I overheard someone ask her what goes in a salad and her answer was "I don't know, salads aren't my thing." Then I watched her incorrectly ring up the man in front of me, who politely pointed out she was overcharging him. Eek.  I got the turkey sub, which isn't your typical deli sliced turkey, but more like the stuff you have after Thanksgiving. I like it in concept, but it had a funny sweet flavor that wasn't working for me. The toppings on the sub were nothing special, and overall my sandwich didn't have much filling or flavor. I was eating at home, so I dressed it up myself.  The two stars come from the shop being tidy and the speedy service.

Hot, fresh, and most importantly, tasty!  My burger was huge and messy, with added real, thick bacon, and spicy grilled jalape√±os.  I shared an order of fries with my sister, and it was plenty for the both of us. And judging by the amount of time it took her to eat her burger and suck down her milkshake through her giant boba-sized straw, she enjoyed her meal as much as I did!  They may be a little more expensive than their counterparts, but the quality makes it worth it.

I wasn't planning on going here. It just sort of...happened.  I wasn't sold after my first look at the menu, but my friend was jazzed about pizza so I just went with it. But first I needed to cure my grumps with a bit of caffeine, so I ordered a cappuccino.  Oh. Yes.  I was in cappuccino heaven. Best cappuccino I have had in my life. At that point I was in for a penny, in for a pound.  My friend and I shared the sorrentina (toasted bread with mozzarella, tomatoes, garlic, basil, olive oil), a light start to hold us over while we decided which pizza to try. Once decided, the pizzas come out super-fast. My amatriciana was a little salty, but I chalk that up to the ample amounts of pancetta. The crust was light and chewy and slightly charred, just how I like it! I couldn't eat it all in one sitting though, because there was still dessert to think about.  And another cappuccino to go with it, of course! Happily provided by our lovely and knowledgeable waitress.  A slice of warm chocolate torte and a shot of limoncello to end the evening, and leftover pizza for the morning. Perfect.

Ok, so I've never had pho before this, so I don't have a benchmark. What I do know was the pho was really bland, so the second time I tried the Asian Invasion cheesesteak... $9 for a sandwich with nothing else, made on a cheap store-bought roll that tasted nothing like french bread.   When my sister saw I wasn't all that enthusiastic about my sandwich, she offered to let me try her banh mi. It was super salty and on the same roll, with veggies that I thought were supposed to be pickled but lacked any bite.  Put enough sriracha on anything and it's edible, but for these prices, I want better.

The first time I came here I was blown away by how nice they were. Not like fake nice, either. They seemed so geniune about giving me the drink of my dreams. And with so many options, they can probably find yours, too!  So far I've had a mocha with butterscotch-banana (imagine Emma Stone's "yum" face here) whipped cream, iced green tea, and plain black iced coffee...all good in their very different ways.  The only reason they don't get the full 5 stars is because of the location. I can't really sit and enjoy my drink at a car wash. But for drive-thru drinks on the run, they can't be beat!

Despite being Phoenix born and raised, this was my first time going for raspados. Not knowing what to expect and having limited Spanish, I'll admit I was a little intimidated. (Silly, I know, but not everyone is a brazen and fiery Pegasus!) I went with the bionico, which was a mountain of fruit and nuts in condensed milk, topped with a huge pile of ice cream (I got strawberry) and shredded coconut, and pico de gallo, a cup of fruit and jicama with a tangy chili coating. Even splitting this between 2 hungry people, it was a lot of food! I can see myself coming back here all summer long.  The seating area was clean, and only occupied by one other person, the son of the owner, who was working on his homework! Yes, it does take a little time to prepare your treat, but it's worth the wait.
