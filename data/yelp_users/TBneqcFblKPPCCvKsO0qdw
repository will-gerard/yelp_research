This review is for Krista. I got a groupon for a gel manicure by Krista for $17. I was excited because she told me she wouldn't charge me extra for French. However she should NOT even offer French as an option because she does not do it well. She did not file my nails down to make them all even, then she tried to use the white polish only where the nail extends past the bed. I tried to point out when I thought the white polish was uneven/ too thin/ too thick - she would try to fix it but fought me about one of my thumbs. She also only applied the polish and didn't initially attempt to even it out with a brush, until I specifically asked her to. She also didn't soak or clean my nails before the manicure, which I found disappointing. She is a very sweet lady, but I was not satisfied with my manicure. I'm sure her non-French manicures are better, but I would not recommend getting a French from her in the future.

I had the chicken sandwich and it was amazing! Had jalapeño bacon and chipotle mayo, which gave it an extra kick, but was not overwhelming. Even the chips have seasoning on them to make the chips and salsa even more delicious! My husband and mother-in-law both had the platter which had the chile relleño, chicken enchilada, and pork burro. They both loved it! I got to try a bite of their sopapilla, and it was phenom! I can't wait to try more on the menu. Also, great service!

I LOVE this place! We've been to both the Chandler location and the Anaheim, CA location. Every single thing on the menu is incredible!! Can't wait to go again and try something new - you literally can't go wrong with any choice! Highly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been here!

I have NOT had my nails done here - I wanted to because of a killer Groupon deal... But I called multiple times to make an appointment and no one ever answers the phone. I left 2 messages and I finally got a call back about a week after my first message. When I answered he demanded I have my groupon voucher information out and ready. I told him I would pull it up and he said "Just call me back when you have it ready - I have 50 other calls to make." I told him it would just be a minute and he insisted I should call back because "I'm sure it will take several minutes and you don't understand how busy I am." Well I immediately called groupon and insisted I be refunded because the worst customer service I have ever received. They refunded me back in Groupon Bucks, which I will be using at another nail salon. I will absolutely NEVER go to Artistry Salon - no matter what deal is offered. No one should treat their paying customers that way.
