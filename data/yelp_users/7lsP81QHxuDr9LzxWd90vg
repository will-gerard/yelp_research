THIS PLACE IS HORID!!!!!!!! How is it still in business???? Iv'e never written a bad review for anything, but this place is worth complaining about. First, their cages are WAYYY too small. They have adult bunnies, baby bunnies (not retaliated to adult bunnies) and guinea pigs all horribly cramped in the same cage. I've gone there twice because I couldn't believe what I saw the first time.Their water is always filthy and I've never seen a strand of hay once in any of the rodents enclosures. My friend and I personally refilled most of the animal's water bowls because it was so filthy. Even the ducks there are only given water three times a day because they, "waste water." They're ducks people! All of the rodents nails were over grown and I held four bunnies and I could feel all of their bones. I even bought a baby chicken from that store just to save it's life, because he was lying on it's back being stepped on by all the other baby chickens. I hated to give them money they definitely don't deserve but I couldn't watch that animal die. Later that day I discovered he had hemorrhoids, this chick was only a week old. There is only one employee that isn't a complete jerk; the woman that gave me the chicken told me he had no chance of living and that birds are stupid anyways. I loathed giving them my money, but now the chick is happy and healthy. (If you think I'm over reacting please took at the photos I have posted on their photos.)

I've only been here once and I HAVE to write a review. I'm so pleased with this establishment I'm still sitting at the table of the restraint writing about how amazing it is. Though it's "expensive" it's very reasonable. If you're feeling the need for healthy fresh, and good food... THIS IS THE PLACE!  (The waiters are also friendly and helpful.)

This place is great, I get sick all the time and they know exactly what to do every time! The staff is amazing; I've never come across a rude nurse there and everyone that works at the front desk are very friendly. They also seem to be able to answer any question I have. :)

This this honestly the best Italian ice I've had! No doubt 10/10 and the staff was friendly. No complaints.
