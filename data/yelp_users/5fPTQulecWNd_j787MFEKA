If I could live off of Postino's Bruchetta Board I would. Actually now that I think about it that isn't a bad idea. The only downside of loving something so much is that I hardly venture out and trying something else on the menu. I think my favorite is the red peppers - I don't know how they get so much good flavor in a tiny little piece.   The only other thing I have had their is what I call the "magic sandwhich." Also known as the chicken and mozzarella panin but I sub the mayo for a pesto sauce. Yum Yum Yum!  Plus they have an amazing selection of drinks and a great happy hour (if only it went a little longer in the afternoon it would be perfection).

I Love love love this airport! They have really made some great renovations to make this a decent layover stop. So many great new local joints here. Blanco. Olive and Ivy. Modern Burger. Dilly's Deli. Chelsea's Kitchen. Tammie & Co. Now all they need is to add a Potbelly's.

If Clark Griswold could only see this. He would sure be proud of the Christmas spectacle and light show that goes on at The Coach House each year during the holidays. It's the oldest bar in Scottsdale and has earned some major points with locals in the area. It's your typical dive bar, but during the holiday times the entire place is wrapped in holiday wrapping paper and then doused in twinkle lights, ornaments, tinsel and Christmas spirit.   Even when it doesn't look like Christmas threw up all over the place the Coach House is still a great end to the night. The mix of clientele makes it good for pretty much any ages (minus those 21 and under obviously). You best be on some good behaviour or at least be able to decently hold your liquour because this place doesn't put up with crap. They'll kick you out with no hesitation, but hey it's not me they are kicking out so I continue to love the place.   Everyone must go during the holidays though.

I also come here on Tuesday nights for their weekly trivia night! Best time to come and put your brain to work. The place is usually pretty popular for trivia nights but they do take reservations so you can save a space for you and your large group and not have to fight for spots each week or show up super early to save a seat.   They run happy hour specials during this time to so you won't be breaking the bank if you don't win the trivia prize. They have plenty of good beers to choose from and the food is alright. Not amazing food but it's your typical bar/pub food. Because its so busy on these nights the service can be a bit slow but you have the trivia questions to distract you and plus the staff is so friendly you can't blame them.

So I had heard amazing things about this place and have wanted to give it a try for a long time. I am the type of person that when I go somewhere or travel I try to find one new cupcake joint in the area to try. After living in NYC where you can find some of the best cupcakes I may have higher expectations than most but I was disappointed with the cupcakes here.   I don't know if I got a bad batch or what but I got four varying flavors of cupcakes and brought them home to my family. We went halfsies and each tried multiple different flavors and were not impressed with any that we had tried. The frosting tasted stale and hard when you bit into it and the cake part tasted like the cupcakes had been out for a couple days.   Out of all of them my favorite if you can call it favorite was momo - but it still was at the bottom of my list in comparison to other local places I have tried.

Pure ice cream heaven! Honestly, I couldn't imagine anything more perfect to take the Arizona heat out of your mind! I had never been to their physical location before, but I had tasted their yummy cold concoctions at various events when they brought out their food truck. The staff are friendly at both and the ice cream is just as good in the truck or in their store.   I had the Peanut Butter Chip and Almond Buttercrunch this time around, both new flavors to me! They were better than I expected, which is pretty hard to do. Both were so creamy and delicious with great flavorts of peanut butter and dark chocolate and almonds and butter toffee respectively. I think that Almond Buttercrunch would have to be my favoritte out of the two.  They are pretty adventurous with their flavors. Some better than others. I can say I tried a truffle ice cream they had to try something new and I wasn't a fan, but I like that they create not your average flavors. I have also had the Salted Butter Caramel and Madagascar Vanilla which are both worth their own few scoops. Definitely a place to have a sweet treat after dinner or a scorching day at work. I can't wait to go back!   It was near vacant when I went, but it was around the time they opened, but they have late hours on the weekends.

I am a sucker for a good burger. I was meeting a friend who worked at the Mirage and we wanted someplace that was casual, not too expensive and at the hotel. The service was decent. Not bad but not amazing either. They had tvs playing the football game so it isn't a bad place to watch some sports.   The burgers were so so good though. I just got a classic cheeseburger and it was perfectly cooked and despite being a simple burger it was so tasty. Everyone really enjoyed their burgers and the milkshakes were good. I also was recommended to order the fried pickles but didn't end up doing it.   I would come here again next time I am in Vegas.

I have just experience food heaven and a food coma all in one! I have always wanted to try this place because I have heard such good things. Their sunset menu before a show at the Gammage Theater was the perfect excuse. Honestly it was such a good deal for so much food and such tasty options. I went with my sister and we each tried something different off the menu and shared. For starters we got the edamame hummus and garden salad. The wonton chips with the hummus were so good and the salad was so light and refreshing.   For the second course I got the vegetable tempura and popcorn shrimp. Both of which were good, but I would go with the shrimp. The vegetable tempura was good but a bit heavy before the final course.   I got the salmon as my main course and my sister got the filet. The salmon was perfectly cooked, but I didn't need the rice and the sauce was slightly too sweet for me. The filet was so good with a great teriyaki sweet sauce and perfectly smooth mashed potatoes. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful in our selections and the ambiance was nice. Not super crowded but we had an early reservation. I want to go back and try the rest of the menu.

Even if your not a meat-eating machine this place has an A-M-A-Z-I-N-G salad bar with top notch ingredients and cheeses and everything your little heart could desire. The important thing to remember when you go is to make sure you go hungry because it can be a little pricey so you want to get your moneys worth of food.  I had been wanting to go here and my work held a business dinner there which allowed me to make it happen. We had a private room in the back which was really nice - made it feel like we were in our own restaurant almost. The staff was so attentive and I love the green means go and red means stop cards you get to show if you want more meat or not. I would forget to turn mine over to red and before I knew it I had every type of meat on my plate.   They were delicious, but I feel like you always end up overeating at this place.

This is a vintage lovers dream house! Located on 6th street near GROWop, Butter Toast makes up half of a historic downtown Phoenix home. I heard another shop is opening up next door relatively soon.  I lived for awhile in NYC and loved scouring the streets for vintage finds and hidden gems. This place competes with the best of them. The clothes are well organized and you don't feel like you are going dumpster diving to find that amazing wool cardigan with the sweet heart buttons or a vintage clutch that goes perfect with your LBD.   Plus the shop owners hand pick everything in the story and don't buy anything they wouldn't wear themselves. For a tiny little shop there is plenty to choose from and lots of different styles and finds. I left the store with a London calendar tea towel, a cute expandable bracelet and a navy cardigan with gold stars stitched in and I only spent $60. Not too shabby.   I can't wait to go back!

Came here last Friday with my parents to use a GroupOn I had gotten recently, but I have been here a couple times before this. I really like this place. It's one of a few great restaurants in Mesa and it has a great atmosphere.   The Happy Hour is such an amazing deal for a ton of food. It's not one of those happy hours where they cut the portions in half. The GroupOn I was using didn't work for Happy Hour menu's and I had to make a reservation in advance and let them know I was using it, but that wasn't a hassle.   The food was superb. I split the SoCal Love as an appetizer. This salad is so refreshing with the champaigne vinagrette and the chick is nice and light with butter lettuce. The avocado, tomotoes and roasted almonds just add to it's greatness. My dad got the garlic fries - they are great but be prepared for some stinky breath because boy are they garlicy. For dinner I had the Scallops which were cooked perfectly and had an amazing sauce and parsnip puree. My dad got the paella which was pretty spicy but had great flavors and my mother got the chicken which was good.   The service was so-so. It took awhile for our water to get our drinks and he was sometimes forgetful, but for the most part the service wasn't bad.

What a nice local coffee shop! I love the atmoshphere and being able to sit outside in the nice Phoenix sunshine with Made just next door and a cute picket fence with sunflowers growing along some of the side. It's such a fresh, free environment where you can relax with a tea or coffee and read a good book, chat with friends or work on your computer. If I lived closer I would come here all the time and just sit, relax and enjoy.   If I were a coffee drinker this place would be perfect, but I do enjoy their tea and they have some good food to choose from. I am hoping to try the crepes.

So my sister and I went to Beckett's table during Arizona Restaurant Week. We had seen it was always featured as one of the great restaurants in Phoenix and thought this would be a perfect time to check it out. Making a reservation was super simple and stress free and they sat us opon arrival.   We went around 6:15pm and the place was starting to get filled, but towards the end of the dinner the place was packed and there looked to be a wait for tables.   Our waiter was very nice and recommended certain menu options when we asked. I ended up getting the steamed white bass with grits and farm vegetables. My sister got the meatloaf which she said was excellent. My fish was cooked perfectly. For starters we both go the vegetable chopped salad which was so fresh and the dressing was delicious.   For dessert we both got the chocolate dipped bacon smores. Minus the fact you are eating bacon and chocolate combined this was so yummy. I felt like I just needed a little fire pit to make the perfect campfire dessert. The entire meal was $30.00 per person that included starter, main, dessert and a free drink.   In the middle of the dinner my sister and I had done some tweeting of our meal to remember and next thing we know the chef comes out and introduces himself and thanked us for spreading the word about Beckett's Table. Totally not expected but really nice he took the time out of the busy kitchen to see how we enjoyed our meal.   I hope to go back and try their short ribs!

Stopped in the Cosmopolitan and were looking for a different style restaurant to try and we came across China Poblano. We had looked into Jose Andres' other restaurant but it exceeded our budget a bit and we saw this place we thought it would be a fun place to try. Hostess was really nice and made us a reservation for later that night. We did have to wait a little bit for our table when it didn't look particularly crowded later on when we came back, but nothing to really complain over.   Service: was good. nothing extremely noteworthy but I felt like they checked in on us frequently enought and the food was out in a reasonable amount of time. Our waiter sugessted some of his favorites and overall I think the service was nice.   Cocktails: I had the Lemon Drop which is a "noodle" inspired cocktail that comes with chopsticks. I didn't love it and for $12 a pop I wanted to love it. After a few sips the noodles got to be annoying and it was a little too sweet for my taste and I like sweet.   Food: we ordered some appetizers. Got the lamb potstickers Stuck on You. I liked them but I wish the lamb had a bit more flavor to it. Needed more seasoning of some sort. For my entree I got the Ocean Nest which is scallops/shrimp/king crab/lobster/pan-fried egg noodles/ seasonal vegetables. Heads are on the shrimp so if that freaks you out its good to know before hand. I really loved the broth of the dish and the whole thing all together, but it was really difficult to eat. By that I mean you can't look cute eating what looks like a birds nest of tightly wound noodles, especially with chopsticks.   I like the setting of the restaurant. It's a nice space. I would come back again but maybe try the Mexican half of the menu.

I think I am in love. This place is heaven for anyone that is a fan of Anthropologie, but wants to show some local love and support Phoenix's local businesses. GROWop is one of the quaintest, sweetest little boutique stores out there.   They are located in a little historic home that's surrounded by a garden. Music to your ears already I am sure. There are so many unique finds in this tiny little shop and the decor makes you feel like you are going back in time with old bookshelves, typewriters and more. There are vintage finds, locally made pieces, cute little dresses and the best smelling candles. Prices range from totally affordable to perhaps just hitting the top of your price points (depends on what you are looking for and what your willing to spend), but nothing crazy expensive.   I can't wait to go back and do some more browsing. Plus the staff is super nice and has a great mix of music playing in the background. I wouldn't mind a little nook for me to just hang out with a book with the sweet scents in the background.

I had been anxiously anticipating when I was going to be able to try this place. I had heard so many good things from reviews and friends but I was underwhelmed with the food and the service.  We went during happy hour after we did the Yelp Shopping Crawl so the place was packed and the atmosphere was nice. We sat outside but the space heaters kept us nice and toasty.   We didn't have to wait to long before we got our drink orders in and we started off with an order of the soft pretzels and fondue. I have had this same dish at Culinary Dropout and they are so good (plus during happy hour they are a discounted price so even better).   I ordered the Turkey Sloppy Joe which was pretty good (I did like it didn't fall apart like crazy), but I wished they noted that it comes with mayo on the menu. They didn't mind giving me a fresh bun that was mayo free. I really liked the side salad that came with it.   A friend ordered the beef burger and they got his order completely wrong and our server didn't seem to care. I hate making a big deal out of messed up orders since you never know if it was the kitchen or the server and people make mistakes, but I think they could of been a little better about it.   Everybody has a bad day occasionally, so I think I need to give this place another shot. The crabbed stuffed chicken sounds particularly tasty.

I can't say I am an expert critic at music venues by any means, but what I can say is that I love a great atmosphere and this place has just that! I went here with my sister for the Blitzen Trapper show last night. I hadn't been before but I had read some good reviews below and this place hit the marks.   The place has an outdoor patio and indoor seating that make for a perfect hangout spot pre-show. They can open up the walls when the weather is nice so everything is so open and airy. I heard the food was decent, but we had dinner elsewhere so I wouldn't really know - except I was tempted at 12:00am after the show to order up one of their churros. The drinks were really good. I had the rest stop which was delicious.   You can hear the music at a nice level from the outside area, but not enough to prevent conversations with friends and fellow drinkers. The venue isn't too huge so you feel like you are experiencing a pretty rockin show with everyone around you. The sound quality to me seemed great minus a few occasions where I thought the ringing of my ears wouldn't stop, but I blame the band Dawes for simply rockin the house down before the main act go on stage.   There is seating in the back and on the sides so you if you don't want to stand don't worry there is plenty of room to sit. There is a bar in the back to order drinks and on the other side the band usually sets up show with their merch. There are also plenty of bathrooms in the back so don't fret if there is a long line at the front where there is only one stall.   Can't wait to go back here again. FYI - if you take the light rail after 11:30pm make sure you are parked at the right spot because they don't run on the full track. We made that mistake and had to cab it the rest of the way while some poor souls had to walk.
