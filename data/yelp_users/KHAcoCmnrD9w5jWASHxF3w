One of the best Arizona Sonoran style Mexican food joints in Arizona, or anywhere in the USA!  Great thin hot chips with typical, but good Arizona style salsas...   My favorite meal on their menu is the #5, Green Chile Chicken tamale, Sour Cream Enchilada, Rice & Beans...  The tamale has lots of meat in it, not like most tamales that are 85% Masa and little meat.  The green chile they cover the tamale with is absolutely wonderful, very fresh green chile flavor and not to spicy as to mask the flavors of the masa & chicken.   The sour cream cheese enchilada is amazing, wait till you taste it, seriously the best Sonoran style enchilada this Chef has ever had....an end product you can only get with using the finest of fresh ingredients!  The only downfalls EB has is no hard liquor, which equates to no REAL Margaritas (Ay, caramba!.....but they do have cold beer & and wine) and sometimes theres a wait for a table....  buen apittite!!!

I love "Old School" Chinese/American Joints... and Mings is one of the last of it's kind... This type of Food should have it's own category, and does in my book, so having said this I can tell ya Ming's IS a 4.5... When I was a kid this was the only type of Chinese Cuisine available... I will miss this Joint when it gone..!

Loved this Joint... Love No More... ! They have changer everything, the only Buffet they have available now is the Hot-Dog Buffet, with only ONE choice of Dog... they used to have at least 8 choices of Weiner's, Brats, Smoked Sausages, Dog's from New York, Chicago...etc... it ROCKED..!!!  they still have Sandwiches a-la-carte... No more Prime Rib or Crab Legs...  they used to have a soft-serve Ice Cream that was part of the Buffet's, no more, now thy have a glassed in Ice Cream freezer with scoops you can purchase...   Hey it's not bad but it's NOT G's anymore..!!! call it something else...   I'm not going back ...they didn't honour my "Yelp Deal"  that I bought for $10 that buys you a coupon for $20 worth of food from G's... I believe that legally they have to take the "Yelp Deals"... we paid the bill with cash and said Adiós to the Cook...   I don't expect them to survive for very long unless they go back to the G's we all know and Love...   If it Ain't broke don't break-it... :(

I have recommended FAST to anyone who has ever asked me about Gun Safety, I know of no less than a dozen that have attended a class for CCW or safety, all have reported a very positive experience... with that, I still stand by my 5 star rating... Thanks FAST for not disappointing...

Been to Angelina's once since they've opened... I was more than pleasantly surprised..! I ordered Fry Bread and it was pipping hot and ready to eat in less than 4 minutes, I could not have asked for a better Fry Bread... it was exactly what I had hoped for, amazingly fresh and there was enough that I could have split it with my lady and been satisfied...instead I ate it all and was stuffed.._  I also had a large Horchata de Arroz (Rice Drink) that was made from scratch (not a mix) that was extraordinarily good, so good I went for a refill and to my surprise refills of Horchata's are gratis..! I will be going back very soon... btw, this Joint is a no frills kinda place, not fancy, and at the same time very clean...which makes it my kinda Joint...

I now have been back many times and my love for this Joint is steadfast... I've now ventured beyond the Fry Bread and still my 5 star rating remains...  Please patronize Angelina's, don't let the Ma & Pa Joints we love falter...we NEED to support our favorite independent local establishments...
