NEVER TAKE YOUR CAR HERE!!!  This place is a complete rip-off and has the WORST customer service I have EVER come across.  We went there and asked what package we needed in order to have the interior of our new car cleaned out. (not shampooed, just the seated sprayed off and wiped) We were told to get the $39.00 VIP package, and it would take care of cleaning off the front and back seats. Not only did the wash on the outside look horrible, they barely wiped down the front seats, doors, and dash, they also didnt wipe anything in the back. I had to argue with the manager for almost 10 minutes about wiping down the back, that took him a whole 2 minutes to do, and it was still so half-assed that I had to do it myself once I took the car home. We paid $39 for what would have been the same wash as the $7 was.  I had then taken my car in for detail since I had received a detail job certificate from a friend a couple weeks prior to this fiasco, and being there are no refunds on detail jobs, I had to take it in or lose the money. So, this past weekend, it went in. They took 5 hours to detail the car. I was expecting it to take between 3-4 like they had originally told me, but, that was just the start of the frustration. I paid to have the car detailed with a clay bar to remove swirl marks and find scratches. There are now more swirl marks on my car than when it went in, not all of the wax was removed, so I had to use my microfiber cloths to remove it myself, I specifically said that I DIDNT want any armorall or leather conditioner on my interior, and to just clay bar the outside, they didnt listen to that, so I spent 30 minutes wiping greasy armorall off my interior and leather. I told the manager that I was completely dissatisfied with the job that was done, he refused to give me any money back and said I would have to bring it back for them to do the job again. I will NOT take my car back to have more damage done for another 5 hour job. I could have purchased the stuff to do the job myself in about 2 hours of time and had it done right.  Please head this warning and DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! terrible wash, and even worse customer service.

Service with a smile is just the beginning to this local bagel shop.  I highly recommend getting a mixed topping bagel with tuna, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, and a slice of provolone cheese.  Dont pass up on getting a side of the tuna salad while you are at it.  This is by far the best bagel shop in the state.

I grew up on home cooked Italian food and specialize in cooking it myself.  This food competes with the best I have ever had.  Everything from "meatball", our server, to the last bite of tiramisu, was absolutely AMAZING.  Meatball was not your typical waiter.  He was not rude, he did not linger and talk to much, or not talk enough.  He had a great personality and I will be going back for the great food and his service again.  The lasagna was outstanding.  Meat sauce with Italian sausage lasagna on top of a bed of penne, what more could I ask for?  The cannelloni franchise was mouth watering.  This place had the BEST spumoni and tiramisu I have ever had.  Thanks to Meatball and the cooks over at Italian Grotto. We had an exceptional time.  We will be returning very soon.

I have been here twice now. I am still very pleased with the food. It is absolutely amazing. There is no other way to describe it. The only thing I have to say bad about this hidden gem, if you are a first timer, do not sit in the lounge / bar. The older female bartender / waitress paid very little attention to us and was not all to friendly. The food mire than made up for the service though. I recommend the Veal Tortellini. You can't go wrong with it.

My roommate and I went here fir the first time today. The price was the only thing that was great. The chicken was dry, the tzatziki sauce was bland and thick, and the so called Greek dressing on my side salad tasted like cheap bottled Italian. The fries were ok, hummus was bland, and I said no onions on anything, yet onions were on EVERYTHING. needless to say, I will NOT be going here again. I can't even say that this was the McDonalds of Greek restaurants cause I would have rather eaten an McDonalds.

I have been to Olive & Ivy a couple times now, and the food is great.  from the ambiance of the restaurant to the smiling and helpful service, this place cant be beat if you want to try something "out of the norm" and tantalize your taste-buds.  This is a great place to have happy hour with tomato cheese flatbread or hummus, or a romantic date.

I cant get enough of the Chicken Pesto with Feta sandwich here.  This place has a great sandwich for a reasonable price.  My only complaint is that they literally put mushrooms on EVERYTHING, but, if you are a mushroom fan, live it up.   On another not, if you like fresh lemonade, you must get a glass of it here.  It goes great with any sandwich.  If you are in a Pasta mood, The chicken pesto pasta is excellent.

Ok, so, I see a lot of other yelper's (yeah, im making a new word) have commented on the Long Trail.  I have to say, that is the first sandwich I had at Vermont Sandwich Company, it is was just AMAZING!!!  I am NOT a huge roast beef person by any means, but, this was no ordinary roast beef.  It was a little rare compared to what you are used to, and it was sliced so thin that it seemed to just melt in your mouth.  We found this gem of a sandwich shop thanks to our local junk mail coupons.  A friend and I stopped by there at almost 8:00 pm to see lights on and the owner working on his computer.  We were wondering if he was open since the door was unlocked and the lights were on, even though the door said they closed at 4.  He greeted us with a smile, gave us a background of the company and made us a free sandwich.  We were hooked.  The customer service here is a big plus for me.  I will refuse to go places that have great food but terrible service, but, this place is top notch in both.  I have been back a few times now and tried things I would normally not like or sandwiches sound like they would taste odd, but, have been pleasantly surprised and very happy with each choice.  Other sandwiches I have had and loved are; Rubens Place (and I hate coleslaw with a passion, but this was the perfect sandwich), The Vermonter (really, apples on a sandwich and cranberry sauce mixed with mayo? what a great blend, glad I tried), Buffalo Chicken Wrap (I'm from AZ, so, it needed ranch, but still wonderful without), and Smuggler's Notch (this is by far the BEST grilled cheese I have had)  Lets not ONLY talk about these amazing sandwiches.  I am addicted to VSC's home made soups.  The 5 bean chili is to die for.  Dont forget tomato soup, if it's made that day (soups change daily), with your smuggler's notch.  When you are done, treat yourself to one of the amazing home made cookies.  I know this is probably my longest review yet, but, I cant think of enough great things to say about VSC.  I always feel like I have to give some constructive criticism on anything, so, if I were to say anything could improve here, it would be the short odd hours.  10:00 am - 4:00 pm Mon-Sat makes it a little hard to get there, especially during the work week, but, if you make it in, you WONT be disappointed.

Friendly staff, management, and owner. This is the Original L&P that started this awesome little small business opportunity.

(wife, fiance, girlfriend, sister, mother, etc) Great natural skin care products mixed with fragrance / essential oils to your specifications, costume jewelry, clothing, sunglasses, wall plaques, and much more to choose from. Stop by this location, you wont regret it.

So, this will not be my best review, especially when I expected so much more from this place.  Lets get this out of the way and on the table first, this ws not a bad place to go, but, it wasnt my favorite by any means.  I went in expecting to pay a lot for the meal, and rightfully expected the best food I have ever had, and that was just NOT the case.  From the high prices to the limited menu, I would expect this place to specialize in the particular menu items, and would hope to have my taste buds dancing while I shout for more.  I didnt.  We started the meal with burratta forno cotto mozzarella.  it consists of oven baked burrata mozzarella served with grilled ciabatta, fried eggplant, lemon-truffle vinaigrette and parsley.  There were only two tiny ciabatta slices which was not the first complaint.  the second complaint would be that the fried eggplant could have used a bit more flavor.  (perhaps a little lemon pepper in the batter would have done some good) Lastly, the dish could have satisfied by just having a bit more cheese.  This dish was not bad by any means, just expected a bit more with the $12 price of two miniature slices of ciabatta and two thinly sliced pieces of eggplant.  on to the salad.  I dont know about you, but, when I order a salad, I expect a salad.  this was a salad, just not with any lettuce or salad look.  we ordered the caprese di pomodoro.  this dish is made with heirloom tomatoes, preserved lemon, herbs, fresh burrata mozzarella and extra virgin olive oil.  from the description, i assumed, dont ever assume, that this was going to have some spring mix as a salad base, then have the tomatoes witih cheese and basil, and then the lemon with olive oil as a dressing.  WRONG.  it was nothing more than what the description said.  it was two tomatoes cut in half, with a small amount of cheese and a few basil leaves and then the lemon preserve mixed with the olive oil on top.  dont get me wrong, this ws absolutely AMAZING, and I would love to have it again.  It is just not what I expected, so, it would have been nice to know what exactly I was ordering for $10.  To make matters worse, our so called salad took about 30 minutes to make its way to the table after putting in the order.  it took so long that the chef actually apologized and told management that he was going to send out a soup for us for the wait.  we were fine and in no rush, but, when we were already having our food take forever and told we were going to get soup, we expected it.  the soup never came.  finally, after waiting for and hour and a half for our main entree, we got our food.  it was good, but, nothing to write home about.  my pollo portofino was bland to say the least, and was actually a little dry.  the potatoes were decent, but again, a bit bland.  my date got the ravioli di mozzarella con salsa all'arrabbiata.  the ravioli pasta was so thick that you really couldnt taste the filling, and the sauce was to sweet in my and my date's opinion.  we however did order a side of the risotto parmigiano, and this was just amazing.  I am very happy that the recipe was on a poast card that came with the bill.  I will be making this at home in the coming week.  for dessert, we ordered pistachio gelato.  it was the best gelato I have ever had.  when it comes to a decision of returning to Alto, it will not be high on my list due to being over priced for what you get and all around, just not the best first experience.  I will however think of stopping in to get some risotto or gelato to go.  when it comes to good Italian, I think I will be sticking with Italian Gratto or Pane e Vino.

One tip, show up right at 11, or you might as well wait to eat till 1:00.  this place is PACKED, and it is packed for a reason.  AMAZING food.  I have been here a few times now and felt that it is time to give a review.  I am big on going to a place at least three times unless the first time was just horrible.  By far the BEST Pad Thai with Chicken I have ever had.  There is just the right amount of food. Not to little, and not to much.  The chicken was cooked just perfect.  Make sure to get a Thai tea, NO MATTER WHAT.  You may or may not like it on the first sip, and it takes a few sips to get used to the flavor, but it is delicious.  (tastes NOTHING like regular tea)  If you are in the mood for curry, then you cant go wrong with the red or yellow curry, both make my mouth water just thinking of them.  This place is a little slow on getting the orders out, but, it is because it is so busy that you cant really complain.  Just be patient if it is taking a little longer than normal because the food is well worth the wait.

Two words, Canal Street.  Get it, eat it, LOVE it.  I have been here probably 20 times in the last 4 months.  Just can't seem to get enough.  If you don't mind spending a couple more dollars than you would at that joke for a sub place, what's it called, oh yeah, subway, then go to Bite Me Subs.  So much meat packed into that sandwich, you will have a hard time eating a 12" sub.  They also have other great items like Breakfast burritos, skillets, and burgers.  You will be greeted by a friendly smile and quick service followed by the best sub in town.  I say thank you to Bite Me for this hole in the wall sub shop, I will see you all again soon.  On my last note, I do feel the need to address one complaint I read from Dar C.  REALLY???!!??  You complained cause you didnt grab your own plastic-wear after getting your salad.  It just happens to be right where they walk over to hand you your food.  That sounds like your own fault.  To give a bad review because YOU messed up is just stupid.  Maybe you need to stick to ordering subs and let them make what they make.
