The yellow chicken curry here is to die for! I have yet to find something similar around my area with the same flavorful taste! Same goes for the shrimp fried rice. There was once a misunderstanding with what I ordered but I didn't mind at all because they brought out this awesome lit up (fire in the middle) mushroom soup (not sure what it's called) and it was amazing!!! Everything here just seems to have so much flavor it makes my tummy happy!  The service is usually pretty quick. The staff are friendly. Prices are pretty affordable. I live about 9 miles from here and ALWAYS crave it!

Never ever will I step foot in this place again. In march we went to have a good night, myself and 3 other people. We were disrespected by the bartender and when we spoke to management about it he told us to get on our way and head on home even though we had spent $500 in bottle service our money there obviously didn't matter to him and he didn't even apologize for the bartenders actions. When we walked out he let the disrespectful bartender join the rest of the employees to say bye to everyone and that's when he continued to harass us and follow us to the parking lot where a bigger incident happened and the cops were involved. It could have been very well avoided if the bartender wouldn't have followed us out and maybe have been told to stay  inside by his manager instead of letting him get back to work like nothing happened. So disappointed with this place and will never recommend to anyone.

Tried this restaurant for the first time today! Went with a couple friends and I honestly had no idea it was a new spot till the waiter told me. Well let's start off with the fact that we got there at 4ish so dinner was not yet ready (starts at 5) and we had to sit either by the bar or high top tables. I was a bit bothered by that since it was 3 of us and we were starving. I did not want to share a tiny small table, but we did anyways!   Since the whole dinner thing and not being able to sit at a regular table did bother us at first. We just decided to only have an appetizer/drink and head on to another place but those minutes flew by and the appetizers came out so quick, we were very surprised. I ordered chicken tacos and even though they are super tiny they were AMAZING! Also the calamari was so flavorful. I asked the waitress to surprise me with a drink and she brought out a coconut beverage that was so good and had just the right amount of alcohol in it. We ended up waiting till 5 to move to a bigger table for dinner. No joke we ordered about 10 different plates and they were all wonderful! I had a second drink which was a coconut/pineapple margarita. The waiter did not mention it was frozen which I did not like but either way it was STRONG! (Very well worth your money if I may say so). Overall, service was great and so was everything else. The place is definitely very hip and modern!

My first time getting a Brazilian and I must say, Layne made me feel super comfortable like I had known her for years. I signed up for the deal to come every month! I'm looking forward to my visits and no more shaving in that area!  Thank you so much again Layne! You are such a sweet heart and definitely taught me plenty about waxing! See you next month!
