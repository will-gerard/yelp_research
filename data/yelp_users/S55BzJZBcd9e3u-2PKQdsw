If I lived closer, I would probably spend a lot of time here.  The facilities are remotely located (but not too remote) and the atmosphere is beautifully designed.  The following amenities are included with your spa purchase, or made available to you when you pay a day use fee (whether you're a resort guest at the Sheraton or a non-guest):  + gym (included in fee with resort)  + locker room use, which includes fully stocked bathrooms/showers, a male or female-only sauna, cool-tub, and outdoor hot tub  + use of the outdoor heated pool (so nice!), towels, lounge chairs, and hot tub  Allow me to elaborate on these amenities... I have nothing but good things to say about them.  Let this also be a warning that you should DEFINITELY plan to take advantage of these features.  Not doing so would surely lessen the value of your treatment!  STAY ALL DAY.  LOCKER ROOM Oh my god, the showers are from a dream...  They are simple stand-up rain shower heads, but each stall has an inner curtain and an outer curtain.  Every time a shower is used, someone comes and cleans the shower and re-stocks the shelves with: a bath mat, 2 large towels and 1 hand towel, and a razor.  Amenities that live in the shower include body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and shaving cream.  Right??  So nice!  Every gym and day spa should be so nice!  I was so impressed, that I took three showers the day I was there... no joke.  But you should take a shower before using the pool, maybe after your appointment, and after you jump in the pool, right?  If you have a spa treatment, you get a plush robe and spa sandals along with a locker/lock to store your valuables.  The locker rooms are equipped with: hair dryers, brushes, combs, cotton balls, cotton swabs, lotion, sunscreen, hand soap, hair gel, hair spray....  OUTDOOR HEATED POOL Amazing...  it is not your typical pool... shaped like a lazy river without the river features.  There is handicap access and "pockets" where you can turn on jets.  The pool is shallow and more for wading and relaxing than having a full on workout; and no diving!!  Lounge chairs surround the pool and the pool pockets also allow for some privacy for you and your partner.  Umbrellas and shade is readily available as well.  Food, beer, and wine, is also provided by waitress service by the pool.  Heaven!  SPEAKING of FOOD... you can order from the cafe from 11-3.  The food is good but definitely on the healthy side..  I have to order a couple things to satisfy my pregnant hunger urges, but it was no problem.  And it tastes good!  Who doesn't like to eat healthy while on a break, anyway?  SPA SERVICES These are expensive..  I had the mommy to be massage which was nice.  I would love any number of their other offerings, including body wraps, exfoliation, special massage, etc.. but didn't want to pay the full price (for which a 20% gratuity is recommended).    But like I mentioned, you don't necessarily need to get a spa treatment in order to enjoy the delight of the warm pool and beautiful scene and Arizona sun.  (Darn you... locals).  I highly recommend going to this spa even without having tried any other spas in the area.

Epic 3-hour long dinner featuring indigenous flavors prepared by a very experienced chef with gorgeous views.  This wasn't even having the tasting menu.  A splurge.  Yes, worth it.  Why?  You really are invited to "experience" the food at Kai.  The staff are very formally trained (which can seem theatrical), but really when you consider the atmosphere, which features local beautiful arts & crafts as well as probably the best sunset views in the area, the flavors and presentation of the food (practically perfect), the slightly stiff staff presentations can be forgiven.  Plus, you can dress up! (but don't under-do it).  Part of the fun going into this dinner was the fact that my husband and I hadn't read anything about the restaurant, knew absolutely nothing about anything, but decided to go because we were staying at the resort and were there for a special occasion anyway.  They also had availability when we wanted to eat there and managed a reservation the night before for 5:45 PM (we were there until 8:30 PM).  Boy, were we in for a surprise!  We each ordered an item from the three courses: Birth, Beginning, and Journey.  For a total of 6 dishes between the two of us we were well fed for the price of about two of the 5-course meals; but because we went a la carte, we had a little more control over the selection, had more to share between the two of us, and were able to pass on the dessert (really unnecessary).  I can't get too detailed on each food item, because the menu is always changing.  But I will say that the husband and I were pretty much blown away by every selection.  The portions were large in terms of fancy restaurants; so shareable at every level (birth, beginning, and journey), but it was really fun to share between the two of us.  The presentation of the food, particularly the items from Birth and Beginning, was gorgeous.  The preparation of the food was just about perfect in terms of flavor complexity and techniques.  I was worried that the Journey would be disappointing because everything else was just unstoppable, but the meats were cooked exactly to our specifications.  If you're curious of the types of foods offered here, let me reiterate that the menu changes.. but some of the items included on our menu were foie gras, escargot, fry bread (so good), roasted vegetables, local cheeses, lobster, sheep, NY strip steak, Big Eye Tuna, Scallops, Duck, Tribal Buffalo, Elk Loin, Lamb; and techniques included molecular gastronomy, french...  In addition, the amuse bouche and intermezzo were a complimentary inclusion to our a la carte selection.

Reasons to love the resort & spa:  + Huge, beautiful outdoor pool (maybe 70 degrees), including a couple hot tubs and a waterslide!  + Several on-site dining options (Kai, Ko'Sin, pool-side bar, and coffee bar)  + Lounging in the lobby section with a view, includes a bar, many seats, indoor/outdoor fireplaces, streams, and chess/checkers tables  + Super short drive from PHX (25 min)  + Off the beaten path  + Rooms with balconies and views of the western sky (sunset, anyone??)  + Got a deal on JetBlue Getaways  + Access to a golf course, 2.5 mile walking/jogging dirt trail, and beautiful spa  + Friendly staff  + Very nice atmosphere with updated amenities  + Local Native American art is featured throughout the resort  Reasons to kinda sorta hate the resort:  + There is 1 elevator in the main lobby  + Confusing layout and very LONG walks from one end to to the lobby  + Half the rooms don't get the sunset views  + Use of the gym is an additional $20 fee and located in the spa (a separate building, but within walking distance)  + The lobby is one the 3rd floor, but the pool is the 1st floor (obviously), but access to the pool is not so obvious...  + You can get into the building at multiple points, but if you don't want to walk back to the lobby elevator, you'll have to take the emergency stairs, which aren't so inviting or easy to find  + Staff seems limited..?  Like if you request something, it takes a while...  + Parking is not convenient for bringing luggage up to your room.  But neither is the elevator lobby...  More details? I enjoyed our stay.  It was a babymoon and the staff really took to it.  They delivered a complimentary slice of million-layer chocolate chocolate cake (I made that name up), which was delicious; we upgraded our room for $20 per night from standard to "preferred," which gave us a king bed and a beautiful view of the western sky (worth it); and possibly a larger bathroom with separate shower and soaker tub.  It's too bad there is no sink outside the bathroom..  Also, I wish the light on the balcony could turn off so we could keep the doors open and un-shaded for full listening pleasure of the wildlife (coyotes and birds mainly).  I would have liked to stay more days to enjoy the resort some more, but the restaurants are a bit on the pricey side and breakfast was not included.  We ate at Ko'Sin for breakfast a couple times, though, and the food is good.  Definitely see my review of Kai separately.  Same goes for Aji Spa.

It was late and the husband and I hadn't eaten dinner yet.  I was fearful that we wouldn't find a thing considering it was prime time dinner time in Vegas on one of the busiest (for weddings) weekends of the year (10/10/10).  Mon Ami Gabi, is not only fun to say, but is a casual french-style dining experience.  The menu had all sorts of good red meat choices: steaks and whatnot; and some onion soup, etc.  But the pricing seemed ... eh ... a little high.  But whatever, we managed to get a seat at the teeny bar (seats 6-8) and talked it up with the bar guy, really cool dude.  This is going to sound boring, but Dave and I ordered the onion soup and shared a burger (we did not intend to go all out this night), which was the perfect choice for the bar seating, right?  Heck yes. The burger was simple in its presentation, nothing out of the ordinary, but the cooking temp and size and vehicle were stupendous and delicious!  So juicy and came with some great skinny frites (those French!!).

The car rental center is PHX's satellite service center for car rentals.  There are numerous car rental agencies located here with a multitude of websites to rent through, but the main reason for this particular review is related to finding it, especially upon return!  This review does NOT reflect my feelings about the car rental service that I actually used to rent the car.  The center itself appears quite new.  There is a huge garage housing the rental cars and a level of the building dedicated to providing service to customers.  The center is about 8-10 minutes FREE SHUTTLE from the airport and each airport terminal provides a shuttle to the single center.  Upon returning your car and heading back to the airport, just be sure you've identified the correct terminal that you need the shuttle to take you.  From return to arrival at the airport, give yourself 30 minutes of fluff in case the shuttle is not there right away.  The signage to get into the car rental center really sucks.  At night there is a serious lack of lighted signs with text large enough to read.  Be aware that the address of this center is at 1805 East Sky Harbor Circle South and you're looking for signs for "car rental return."  If you're returning from south of Phoenix, you're on the I-10 heading West.  You want to take Exit 150B to South 24th Street.  Take a Right at the end of the ramp onto S 24th.  At the first light there is NO SIGN HERE!! but you need to take a Left onto Sky Harbor Cir S.  Keep your eyes open!  Your next turn is to the left.  Here there is a TINY SIGN that says "Car Rental Return" and there is no lighting for this sign!  The facilities are clean and the shuttles are frequent enough.  Good luck!!
