I have not experienced the "rudeness" people have posted below.  Their stuff is priced reasonably.  I inquired about a custom made metal planter like the one in front.  I thought they offered a great price for the materials and work involved.  I brought my girlfriend up here and she was not that into the stuff.  It just may not be for everyone.  I read the reviews below expecting the staff to be rude but i found them to be the opposite.

This place is awesome!  I just wish they still carried the instant cold noodle packs.  I think i might have been the only one buying them so I see why they dropped it.  I have always had good experiences here and have been here dozens of times. I started coming here three years ago with my girlfriend.  She is korean.  Her mom often goes to this location when she comes to visit and she always seems to be able to find whet she needs.  In case you are confused this is clearly a Korean supermarket.  Maybe the people that feel like they are getting yelled at have not spent much time with Koreans. They seem to always be yelling.  They are also extremely blunt.  If you are sensitive I suggest you might cry as I see in the other reviews.  The Asain pears are always huge and delicious.  I took off a stare because the flavours in the little deli are inconsistent.      FYI. This place caters to the Korean demographic so one could logically deduce that the workers native tongue might be Korean and there might be lots of words in Korean .  Oddly enough maybe even some hand written signs.

I can not say enough good things about these guys and their product.  The staff was friendly, knowledgable and  fast.  I had a horrible experience at evergreen turf in chandler this morning.  Not only did these guys madke me feel good about this situation I saved about $0.10 a sqft.  They also have a new Bermuda called platinum  that is incredibly beautiful.  I asked a ton of questions and they took the time to offer advice and cautions.  They also offered advice about what I could do to fix some problem lawns I recently took on.  The interaction with this company was great and I hope that everyone starts using them.  I can't wait to use these guys again!!

Came here to pick up sod we were told would be here in the morning.  The gentleman that we spoke with said no problem it will be here.  He never stated we needed to make a reservation in addition to us telling him that we would be there first thing in the morning.  I drive an hour to get here.  When I walked in this morning they said that that  we never made a reservation and they sold the sod that they told us that they had for us because we did not make a reservation.  We were never asked to make a reservation and we were specifically told that it would be here in the morning it would be "no problem".  After speaking with the gentleman he now states we need to make a reservation two days in advance.  Perhaps his own rules confused him.  He also said since we only needed 200sqft he sold it.  I understand it is a small quantity.  That is why we called in advance.   We made arrangements with no ambiguity telling him we would be here first thing in the morning when they opened. The implication of that statement implies a reservation made on my part.  The definition of reservation is  to keep back or set aside, esp for future use or contingency; withhold.  I could not physically reserve the sod so that would require action on their part.  Failing to understand that stating a time and quantity is in fact requesting a reservation.  Telling me that said product would be her is an acknowledgment of a reservation.  No customer service and they need to purchase a dictionary!  I do not recommend doing business with these individuals.

Horrible is all i have to say.  $100 dollars for an oil change and upgraded car wash the car looks barley touched.  I would have been better of getting an oil change elsewhere and just use a gas station drive through car wash.  They dusted off the seats with a dry cloth and left dirt everywhere.  They didn't vacuum the  back floor at all.  I have rubber mats that were not touched.  I had to keep telling the guy to wipe down all the black plastic which clearly had not been touched.  I finally just gave up and left.  Maybe that was the goal.  No pride in work or any attention to detail.  Not only that but i was the first car there at 7:30.  It took 1.5 hours.  I think i will save my money next time.  Maybe if you spent less time trying to sell me extra shit and focus on completing what i already paid for you would get better reviews.  Fyi its 2015 have you heard of wifi.  This location has notoriously bad cell service.  If i have to sit around waiting for a not even half assed job i would hope to help the time pass.

I called these guys on Monday 6-23-15 around noon.  I had spent the rest of the morning calling countless electricians that wanted thousands of dollars to replace a damaged bus bar on a pedestal.  In addition to that it was 110 out and the water for the house and horses runs off electricity Not to mention we had no ac.  I spoke with the girl in the office and sent her pictures.  She told me a tech could not make it out that day but would be out the following day we are pretty rural and about an hour from them in the rio verde area so that was understandable. Asked her to have the tech call me so i could meet him there about an hour before he gets there.  The tech James called me at around 10:00 the next morning and made it out about 11:00.  He was fast knowledgeable and an awesome guy.  He was done in about an hour and had us up and running for hundreds of dollars vs thousands.  I think it took him longer yo drive out than to complete the work.  These guys are awesome not to mention they could fix what 6 other electricians could not and they did it in less than 24 hours.

This is by far one of most most favorite spots back in AZ.  Coming here always reminds me that I am home.  From the moment you step inside it is like a you are in another place.  The WILD Mushroom, Spinach and Leek Quiche is amazing and the Warm Brie with Caramelized Apples are phenomenal.  I can not wait to return.

I foolishly expected a place with doughnuts in the name to actually have more selection than circle K.  I was wrong.  I walked in about 30min after they opened and saw that all the shelves were empty. It took a couple minutes to be helped, I was the only person inside.  I was finally greeted.  I said  I would like to get a Dozen.  She said ok. I just looked are her expecting to to maybe bring them out.   I m thinking I am going to get some fresh donuts to bring to the family. After a small confused stare off I asked what they have.  She then said they only have glazed. I said thank you and left. I drove down the street to Krispy Kreme a filled an order in about 45 seconds.  I went back afterwords just to take a picture and see if they had anything else.  As you can see after being open for over an hour the selection is minimal.I will be driving to extra 10 minutes from now on to get donuts.  I just got back from a trip to Korea where there are many dunkin donuts.  They are amazing there. I included pictures of the korea vs this store.

These guys are clowns!  I took my girlfriends iPhone front screen to be repaired.which I could have done myself.  Keep In mind I have done this before and know what I am doing but I was being lazy. Went in asked them about getting it fixed and they offered me their Groupon special to get next day service for $49.  I said ok.   I specifically asked if they replaced the whole front including digitizer and LCD when I dropped it off and told them I was bringing it in because I wanted it fixed now and didn't want to have to order the parts and do it my self.  Picked it up all was good until exactly 30 days later the LCD fails, no falls or bumps just goes white while using it.  I called and said hey you just put this in and the LCD is bad.  They said they didn't replace the LCD.  "I said what do you mean?  The safety glass is glued to the LCD".  Again saying we only replace the glass unless you say that the whole thing need replaced. I told her I did and asked why would you unglue the safety glass from the LCD ,which is twice as much labor and you will probably damage the LCD. No answer.  Anyway they said the only have a 48 hour warranty and agreed to look at the phone for $15 dollars and if the LCD is bad I would have to pay for it. No thanks and way to stand behind your work.  Needless to say make sure you have a good bank so you can dispute the charges for crappy work and poor customer service if you go here. I wish I looked at yelp first and saw these reviews.  I always look at yelp for everything including looking for an apartment.  I will not make that mistake again. A and A computer sucks!!!

I used to love this place but the service has steadily declined to complete dog #%^#.  The past three times i have been to this location I paid a minimum of $30 for food.    I have been handed the wrong orders twice before my order and handed them back bags of food meant for other customers.  This might explain why on my most recent visit we waited over 20 minutes for our to go order.  Meanwhile bags of food were handed out to three different vehicles behind us.  I am sure one of those our order.  When we got our food it was hot and we made the 20 min drive home. We got home and the Hamburger with bacon and no mayo was a cheeseburger with mayo.  The cheeseburger with no mayo or tomatoes had plenty of both.  The Italian sausage with sweet peppers, hot peppers and grilled onions had only hot peppers.  Here is a tip.  If you pull up to the window and there is a plump rotund employee standing between your car and the window maybe the rotund guy should get outta the way or stick around to hand me my damn food.  Instead I had to get out of my car to grab my food when he needed to walk back to the first window to chat.  This place is probably way too overstaffed and just a mess.  Also why don't you you let me pull all the way up to the menu incase i want to order something different.  No i don't have the whole damn menu committed to memory.  Clearly your employees do not either.  I will not be going back here anymore.  It is just not worth the hassle.

Absolutley DO NOT use this place!  After taking more than 100 items,  many with tags they said that they would go through and ket me know what they would take.   We never heard back from them and they claimed they took about 13 items and donated the rest.  They are full of it.  This place is a joke.  Customer service is a joke.  I asked for the items back because they were supposed to let me know how much they were taking before donating.  They said it was too late and its over with now.   This is the WORST experience i have ever had in dealing people.  In my opinion These people are bottom feeders and they are the scum the earth.  Just donate your clothes and get a receipt.  Do not trust these people.

In my opinion she and her staff are thief's and should not be trusted.  In my opinion she Responds with flat out lies and and is not sincere in the least.

I have taken a number of phones here.  I know how to do many of the the repairs myself.  They charge great prices and do awesome work!  They even helped me piece together two phones from a bag of parts and broken phones.  I needed this done so I could early edge the phones.  Am sure I will be going back.

Love this place!  I used to go to one in Vegas when i lived there and could not wait when i heard this one was opening.  I love the spices and eating with my hands.  I personally have never heard of waitresses giving instructions on how to eat your own food. Lol.  I think when I was 6 I surmised the crawfish look like mini lobsters and you probably eat them the same.  Anyway.  The place is really good and everyone i have brought here has loved it.  I wish they were able to take reservations for large parties.

I was super skeptical about having to cook my own pizza.  Upon first entry I thought  this is just a glorified dominoes where i can see them make my pizza but i have to cook the damn thing.  We got the Stuffed Crust Pizza which consequently produced enough leftovers fir three days.  When they were making the pizza i was completely shocked with how much was on this thing for the price.  I felt like money well so far.  Then i thought with my shitty oven there is no way this thing will be anything but soggy.  Fortunately I was dead wrong.  The thing came out crispy and amazing.  Fresh hot and melted in our mouths.  Everyone enjoyed.  We got the smores pizza also and cooked that the next day because we just had too much food for less than $20.  I will not be ordering delivery again.  Not to mention the prices.  Comparable rosatis  would have easily been twice the price.
