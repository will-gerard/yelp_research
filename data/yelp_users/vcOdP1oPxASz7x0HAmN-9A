Been coming here for 3 years and they've only gotten better. Whenever we are not satisfied they go the extra mile.

Mattress was delivered today right on schedule!  Justin, the strongest man I know now, was kind, professional and courteous.

Seriously poor service! After receiving our food we sat there for 25 minutes waiting for anybody who worked at the place to give us a fork as our food got cold. The manager said it wasn't acceptable that we didn't have forks and she would get them for us right away that never happened, she walked off and disappeared. Others who were sitting next to us were seated and didn't receive their drinks for over 20 minutes. The sad thing is it wasn't even busy.  Even after another manager came over apologized and comped our meal which was nice of him, we still had empty glasses of water the rest of our stay. I used to love this place and love the food here but with this service, I don't know  Seriously poor service!

My 10th call to Cox communications in 14 months for them to tell me that I am right about there being an issue with my internet speeds again. Every time they come out I get 50-60 mbps for about 3 weeks which is what I pay for,  then it's back down to 5-10 mbps.  Today I only had to wait on hold for 52 min before I had to hang up because of another emergency call, then call back and wait for 41 min to have a the rep hang up on me mid sentence on accident, then call back and wait for 39 min to have the rep tell me she is sorry about the loud crackling noise on the phone everytime one of us talks...her headset has been broken for 3 weeks and Cox won't give her a new one. That's 2.2 hours to schedule a technician to come out.   I've been a customer for over 4 years but thinking about sacrificing for 40 mbps with CenturyLink just to avoid this headache of a company and product.

Chandler Dental Arts is the most honest and dependable dental practice that I have encountered.  Not saying there are not others out there, but I was with 3 other dentist in the valley before Chandler Dental Arts and all where a bit shady to say the least. My wife's estimate from our previous dentist for $7200.00 accompanied us on the first visit there in 2010.  After xrays, and a cleaning Mital Patel DDS sent my wife on her way and said her teeth and gums were impeccable and no work was necessary. Through the years we have grown to trust the integrity and reliable service from the Chandler Dental Arts staff.   Most recently, I cracked a crown on an old tooth that I had a root canal on a few years back.  Not only was the service immediate, but I was upgraded to the strongest material out there to ensure it does not happen again.   In that same week my 11 year old daughter had a brace bracket fall off her tooth that caused the braces wire to poke her cheek and gum causing pain.  We could not get ahold of the orthodontist and the next day discovered we could not get in for a couple of days.  After one call to my dentist we were able to get her in within a couple of hours and he corrected the issue! Mital Patel and staff are truly the best in the industry with undeniable skill at what they do and ethics that are recognized and appreciated.

Love this place!  Great service and food every time I've been there. I've taken my family and clients and every time we've left happy. Love the variety on the menu though it could be a bit big. The coupons are great as well.

Though the food was good the service was extremely slow. Took 20 min to order, 40 min for food, 35 min to get our check after we completed eating and the waitress asked if we wanted dessert.   Service was poor for Red Lobster

The absolute best prices and best service! It is rare to find a combination of good work great customer satisfaction and knowledgeable staff. As a realtor I've worked with several termite inspectors. This is the only crew that puts protection on their shoes when coming into your house. I highly recommend.

These guys are legit!  Not only are the prices right where they should be, the work is some of the best I've seen!  These guys are professional, knowledgable and provide some of the quickest service I've experienced. I will return with every vehicle I own for a much needed in Arizona clear bra and if I ever wrap again, SmartFilm is my destination. Quality, competitive pricing and customer service... 5 Stars!
