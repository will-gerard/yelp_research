I rarely get food,  but the happy hour specials draw me in at least once a week.  20 ounce draft beers,  including good beer (ie. not bud,  coors or miller),  for $3...  Great price for me.

Unfriendly employees (except one or two - one of the dog training girls is great) ,  always gossiping amongst themselves. Expensive prices,  but good specials with the rewards.  Store is usually unorganized.

No matter how many times I go, I'll never get used to the ordering system. But the food is delicious (expensive, but it's one of the few places near me with healthy options). I love their Broccoli Cheese soup and the Greek Salad. Plus it's nice to take some time to sit down with a good book or NDS game and relax on my lunch break.

Clean store,  fair prices.  Only wish is that the draft area would be manned during peak areas so I don't have to find someone to fill my growler.

If I could give 0 stars, I would.  Whenever I order from NewEgg, OnTrac delivers and always just drops the (very expensive) package off in front of my apartment unit door without so much as a knock.  I ordered a product from Amazon and chose same-day delivery. The package was to arrive by 8pm, and I was home from 3:30pm onward. When 8pm came and went, I checked the order status. Apparently, the delivery driver stopped by around 7pm and did not even bother to come deliver to my apartment (the address listed), but instead stopped at the leasing office, saw it was closed (duh), and left without leaving so much as a notice. I still have not received my package. AWFUL service; WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU IGNORE THE ADDRESS ON THE PACKAGE AND GO TO THE LEASING OFFICE WITHOUT EVEN SEEING IF THE RECIPIENT IS HOME?!

I order delivery through eat24. Food is always hot,  not too much grease,  usually prompt delivery.  Inexpensive too.

First time at Jersey Mike's; When you order online,  they make your sandwich the exact opposite of what you ordered -  it's great!  We ordered an Italian and a Club,  no onion, no mayo,  add banana peppers and pickles. We received an Italian and a Turkey,  covered in onions and mayo,  no banana peppers or pickles on soggy bread.  Didn't discover it until I got home.  Never again.  I'll stick to Jimmy Johns or Goodcents.

Service is sometimes too slow and unattentive.  But food is always good and happy hour beers go well with the happy hour hummus trio tapas.

I wanted to try this place when I was in Austin, but did not get the chance. My husband and I visited this restaurant at 2 pm on a Saturday, so it was busy but not packed. We each ordered a burger and a beer and shared an order of queso fries. For those who like queso fries the way they are made in Austin, I would not recommend this dish. The cheese sauce is served on the side of the fries. It was very good - just not exactly what I expected. The burgers were delicious - definitely the best in the area. I love the draft beer selection, as this is one of the only places in Arizona that serves a large variety of Arizona-brewed beers. Great place to try  a new bev and I will definitely be coming back.   I'll admit, the ordering system is a bit confusing for Arizonans (you place your entire order and pay at the counter, then they bring out your food), but they do have servers for each table if you forget to order something or need another beverage. They offer self-service all-natural sodas (yay, sugar cane), so you definitely will never need to wait for a soft drink refill.  In all, two filling burgers, two local drafts and a large order of queso fries ran about $37. I've paid way more for food and drink of a lesser quality.

Warning: The chocolate brownie cookies must be loaded with crack, because they are extremely addictive. Broccoli cheese soup is phenomenal, and the sandwich (Italian) was good as well. 10/10 would eat again, and again, and again.
