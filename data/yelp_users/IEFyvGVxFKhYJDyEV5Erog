I'll admit, I've been more than a bit curious to try out this car wash, located on a particularly sketchy stretch of McDowell. The pricing seemed to good to be true, too: $20 for a wash and hand wax on my Wrangler. The gamble paid off, though: the final result was fantastic! The exterior was shiny, vinyl and rubber surfaces dressed, and interior vacuumed and free of the remaining dog hair that another, more prominent hand wash establishment left coated on the carpeted upholstery.  The actual waiting area is not bad: there is assorted auto merchandise for sale and, while dim, it was clean and well air-conditioned. Be prepared to pay in cash.

Roscoe's will always occupy a special place in my heart.  It was the first gay bar I went to after arriving in Phoenix nearly eight years ago, and the de rigueur after-practice meeting place during my brief stint with the local gay rugby club.  Good beer, cheap-'n-greasy munchies, darts and pool, and great satellite sports viewing elevate this place to be a good neighborhood hangout, gay or otherwise. The fact that the gay boys ("str8 acting," "iso str8 acting," or "str8 acting-in-training") congregate there is just the icing on the cake.

Cathy Hayes and her team are some of the best in the business for interior design in the Valley.  If you've been to the LGO/Postino plaza, Chelsea's Kitchen, or the Valley Ho, you've seen some of this firm's work.  I don't think it's an overstatement to say that Cathy has really put her mark on the urban renaissance still underway along the Camelback corridor.   Disclosure: the firm drew up the blueprints and colorboard for our condo in the Biltmore area, but we couldn't be happier with the results (think updated mid-century meets A&C).

Like Prissy, I *heart* Orange Table's Monkey Cakes and agree that the portions are extremely generous.  The service is extremely unpredictable: I've been in and out within 45 minutes for a weekend breakfast but have also waited for an hour for my food.  The puzzling thing is that the wait doesn't always seem to correlate with the number of patrons in the restaurant.  All in all, I like OT for when I want to hit Fashion Square after breakfast and am too lazy to schlep downtown to Matt's Big Breakfast.  A bonus: if the wait is driving you crazy, you can always cruise next door to browse the displays at the creepy wig shop.

As I just finished a somewhat negative review on my recent visit to the Scottsdale Quarter location, I feel compelled to post a counterbalancing review for the Old Town one. Time and time again, I find Grimaldi's to be our standby pizza joint: perfect thin-but-chewy crust, topped with just the right amount of sauce and ingredients such that we can leave there having pigged out and yet feeling merely comfortably full. The house salad is simple yet perfect starter to lead in to the main event. Also, we are always able to get seated right away, thanks to people's inexplicable aversion to being sitting at the plentiful and generously sized high-top tables right through the front door.   Which leaves me with my only suggestion: please ensure that the new SQ location is putting out the same quality product! I hope the oven crew gets a handle on getting the crusts right eventually.

Ventured here for HH last night; service in the bar/lounge area was efficient and courteous. HH menu pricing was very good: $3-5 for rolls and $3-7 for various appys and entrees. Drinks were really reasonable as well-I got a bottle of Sapporo with hot sake for $5, and the house red or white was $4/glass.  I really wanted to like the food more than I did. The calamari and chicken tempura were each served with a surprisingly flavorless remoulade, and the breading was equally unremarkable. Veggie tempura from the menu was served with the traditional tentsuyu sauce, but the vegetables were a tad too raw and cold for tempura.  California and spicy tuna rolls were tiny and not particularly well-formed, but serviceable; the oblong-shaped crunchy spicy tuna roll (a deep-fried or carmelized piece of rice, topped with the spicy tuna spread, a pepper slice, and sweet eel sauce) had not-so-fresh tuna spread and was not particularly appetizing in appearance. Spring rolls were cut into four or five pieces and drizzled with eel sauce--nonoffensive, I suppose, would be the best term.  On the positive side, the seaweed salad was delish-but what doesn't sesame oil make tasty?

The best way to describe Matt's is "breakfast nirvana."  I've been going to this cheery downtown spot for weekend breakfasts and weekday lunches for around 2 years now and have never been disappointed with the food.  Small touches of quality abound: freshly-ground pork sausage patties, perfectly browned, homestyle potatoes o'brien (not of that cubed pre-frozen crap), thick-cut bread with homemade jam, and what tastes like real maple syrup for Matt's awesome pancakes.  What keeps a breakfast enthusiast like me from hitting Matt's at each opportunity are the insane queues, especially on weekends.  The air conditioning can also be a bit sketchy at times, too, given the cramped space and swarm of humanity in there at busy times.

Kashman's is North Scottsdale's best-kept open secret, something that many people living in the depths of Central Phoenix have never heard of and would never deign schlepping to for breakfast.  We became intimately familiar with it when we lived for nearly a year up in a  Grayhawk apartment, waiting for our condo renovation to be completed.  I love the egg dishes (try the Chicago omelet), the salads (Trifecta rocks), pastries made in-store (the black-and-whites are good, and the fat-free blueberry muffins are better than the regular ones--all are usually refrigerated, though, so you may want to ask for your muffin to be heated before serving) and the bagels have the perfect bite and chewiness (contrast with the bagel-shaped bread that Einstein's churns out).  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have found the owner's family to be quite friendly and quick to recognize regulars.  Seating is sketchy during peak hours, although, for a relatively small strip-center establishment, there are a decent number of tables in and outside.  As a first-timer, remember to ask the wait staff at the door to give you a number corresponding with an open table.  You will need this when placing your order at the counter.  It can be difficult to peruse the large menu, so it may help to grab a paper copy before queuing up.

I am so grateful to finally get a Wildflower in the neighborhood.  I love all the pastries there, and their hot breakfasts, soups, salads, sandwiches, and pastas hit the spot throughout the day.  Service is brisk when you order a cook-to-order item: order at the counter, sit down with a color-coded table sign, and a serviceperson delivers the food to your table in minutes.  I haven't noticed a big lag in wait time, even at peak hours.   Best of all, because of the quasi-fast food setup, it's a setting you can feel comfortable dining in whether alone or with a group of friends.  A big con: the convergence of Pei Wei, Wildflower, and Pita Jungle make the shopping plaza this location is situated in a nightmare to negotiate through during lunch hours.

I loved Pita Jungle as an ASU student and was elated when I saw that this location was opening up in my neighborhood a few months back.  Since it opened, I've taken every opportunity that's come up to drag uninitiated friends over to sample their flavorful and healthy offerings.  No one's walked out disappointed.  Personal favorites include the lavosh shawarma wrap, spicy chicken wrap, broiled chicken salad (a great way to load up on lean protein), and the caribbean fruit salad (massive).  The value you get from the huge portions is insane.  I love the fact PJ is open until 10 every night.  As I noted in my Arcadia Wildflower Bread Company review, beware of this plaza during weekday lunch hours: the parking situation is ridiculous.

Alas, I hate to put an end to the string of five-star reviews for this establishment, but I had a rather mediocre first experience at the much-ballyhooed Butterfield's this morning.    I'll start off with the good points.  I really liked the spinach scramble I ordered (I opted for the egg white sub), and the cheese grits I sampled were light and tasty.  The coffee was decent, although not up to that of, say, Breakfast Club (I believe they serve Illy) or even the private-label stuff at Wildflower.  (NB: The heavy cream served with the coffee was unnecessary.  Being a part-year Canadian, I think the best cream for coffee--if used at all--is the 18% mf coffee cream widely available in the Great North.  More flavorful than half-and-half, but not quite as sludgy as heavy cream.)  Now for the bad points that made it a two-star breakfast for me.  First, the pancakes: I paid extra for two multigrain cakes instead of the buttermilk and was horrified when I bit into one.  It seemed undercooked in that it was soggy and tasted of raw flour.  Undeterred by the setback, I had my BFF dining companion give me one of her buttermilk pancakes.  Better, but still none of the slightly crunchy bite that epitomizes that golden "crust" of a perfect pancake.  Being a throwaway starch side to the meal, I would have let the gross pancakes slide, but for God's sake, this place bills itself as a "pancake house."  (Incidentally, if you're thinking there's no such thing as a tasty multigrain pancake, try the protein cakes U.S. Egg serves up.  The PCC Men's Grill will also whip up delicious ones to order.)  Second strike: Butterfield's "maple syrup."  I've had plenty of maple syrup of all grades (interestingly, the cheaper/lower the quality of maple syrup, the stronger the maple flavor), and the stuff they put in their private-label bottles is the oddest-tasting maple syrup I've ever sampled.  If, however, you are a fan of ersatz syrups like Mrs. Butterworth's, by all means, stock up: customers can buy Butterfield's syrup to take home.  I end my review on a lighter note: those of you who know me also are familiar with my occasional lapses into East Coast snobbery when I ridicule the Midwest. (Four years in Chicago for college: I think I paid my dues.)  My friend Kerry, a proud Michiganian, always sticks up for her regional plot during these times.  Sitting at this restaurant, which apparently hails from the Chicagoland area, she mumbled, "I hate to say this . . . I *really* hate to say this . . . but this place is so Midwestern.  Ugh."  Hearing this pejorative remark brightened me up and almost made up for the subpar pancakes.  Almost.

A reliable, trustworthy cleaner for your dry clean onlys that won't rip you off is hard to come by.  Green's owner, however, really gives you that sense that she cares about your clothes--she gave me tips, for instance, on how to keep crickets and moths at bay from my winter cashmere.  Best of all, she will give customers, new and old, a 20% discount with or without the coupon.  Try Green Cleaners out!

A tasty and reliable place for a casual or business lunch. There is a small, sun-drenched (but misted) patio with plenty of seating and a large, dark inside dining room. Wraps and sandwiches range from decadent to healthy (personal faves are the Apricot BBQ Feta Chicken and Dragon Chicken Pita) and entree salad portions are extremely generous (try the Sangria or Super Chop). Burgers look decent, although I have not personally tried one. Great drink menu: I've never had to send back a watered-down Manhattan here. Wait times for tables and service can get a bit dicey at peak times.

Auto repair shops are like hospitals: you hope not to frequent them, but are especially grateful when you've found a really good one. 180 Degrees Automotive is my new car clinic. Fortunately, I went in on a small matter: I only needed a place to bring my Wrangler for its first oil change. While I did not have the benefit of a friend's coupon (new customers receive 2 "free oil change" certificates to distribute), my Yelp check-in brought the total cost down to around $28.  Service was friendly and helpful: a whiteboard greeted each client on the schedule by name. The chic glass-and-cement waiting area is the cleanest and most comfortable I've ever seen, with complimentary snacks and a Keurig machine for tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. Driver service was offered, even for my oil change. The number of satisfied, repeat clients for non-oil change matters who I saw processed through reception also boosted my confidence. I arrived for my 8:00 appointment on-time and left almost exactly an hour later, in less time than the 90-minute estimate given to me.  Overall, my visit was a surprisingly pleasant experience that I never thought I would have at a garage.

Tailwinds has been my go-to daycare and boarding place for some time now, and it really is a top-notch operation. It starts with the design of the facility: nice, gated entry to allow owners to enter one-at-a-time with their dogs as needed, and a beautiful area for dogs to roam with artificial grass and separate large, cylindrical buildings for indoor activities (dogs are kept separated by size/activity level). As advertised, there are snacks and "educational TV" for the dogs inside. Staff is more than happy to give you updates on your little one(s).  In the end, my dog's reaction is my most reliable barometer. While he will sometimes cry or pull away when we go to another daycare business, he's actually excited to run through the gates when he realizes we are at Tailwinds. I highly recommend it.

My friend Caroline and I visited 5th and Wine on 4/16/10, a Friday evening around 5:30, for drinks and a quick bite before the 7:30 showing of Greenberg @ Camelview (terrific movie, btw). We were pleased with our choice.   Foodwise, the happy hour menu wasn't super extensive, featuring a handful of apps from the regular menu. 5th and Wine does have an extensive bruschetta menu, reminiscent of Postino; we chose, however, to order sandwiches and paninis, the selections of which looked quite tasty. (I was tempted to try the daily special entrée, which was beef bourguignon a la Julia Child, but held back.) We each took advantage of another happy hour special, any wine on the restaurant's regular list for $5/glass. Although the pour wasn't super-generous, it's a good way to sample from 5th and Wine's very balanced selection.  The one HH app we tried, prosciutto-wrapped breadsticks, arrived in the form of pencil-thin grissini drizzled with a horseradish dip--overall, surprisingly satisfying. My ham-and-mozzarella panini, a recommendation of our waiter, was well-prepared, served with fries liberally sprinkled with Pecorino, red pepper, garlic, and parsley (delish), while Caroline's humble-sounding tuna sandwich was equally flavorful and zesty, with a nice bite coming from the incorporated champagne vinaigrette.   Although the main serving area of the restaurant was apparently booked by a rehearsal dinner, there was still seating available in the small annex we were seated in. There was some sort of amp or speaker awkwardly muffled with moving blankets near a table (couldn't they have just turned down the volume?), but ultimately, it didn't detract too much from what was otherwise a very positive experience.  While I loathe to rave about a restaurant on Yelp (and thereby abet in the massing of the hordes at my fav spots), I can't restrain myself when I come across a gem that deserves it.

Groupon users beware! A friend and I went to try Fuego Tacos on Saturday night, each of us holding a $10-for-$3 Groupon. Given that the Groupon (legitimately) included the one-Groupon-per-table restriction, we opted to sit at the bar to allow us to each use our Groupon. Both the bartender and manager refused to honor the Groupons, on the basis that we "walked in together" and that the "boss" would be very upset if they honored both.  We opted to go elsewhere on principle. The printed terms clearly stated that Groupons were to be limited to 1 per table, not 1 per "party" or "people walking in together." I do not believe this interpretation is unreasonable or overly legalistic. The Groupon would have covered less than half of our respective bills, after drinks and dessert. A pity, to have to post a star rating on the basis of policy rather than food quality...

We arrived at 7:00, had a party of six, and were able to be seated within 15 minutes. Fabulous, considering the number of hungry people coming into the restaurant that evening, but we have always had good luck getting right into Grimaldi's, regardless of the location.  The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it, but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza. One of the reasons my partner and I keep going back to the Old Town location is for the consistently tasty crust: crisp and thin, yet chewy and moist as well. Our pizza last night had a thicker crust and too well done, by comparison. Maybe the QC will improve as time goes on--I'm sure we'll be back to see.

Finally, central Phoenix gets a BoSa Donuts! Perfectly housed in the former Carvel Ice Cream building in the Thai Lahna strip center, walking into the space is like being transported to a sanitized version of your favorite 24-hour SoCal fried dough joint (and much more cheery than Rainbow on McDowell, which has seen better days). On this maiden pre-work run, I stuck with a maple long john and coffee. The dough was tender, with no off flavors from old fry oil or chewiness from sitting around, and the icing had a nice sugary snap. The coffee was standard-I am eager to try the chai milk tea with boba pearls on my next visit.  The only small suggestion I would make to the owner is provide a little more seating and turn up the AC ever so slightly. I know donut shops are usually a tad toastier than other eating establishments, but if you are going to offer free Wi-Fi and stay open until 10, it will definitely help build a visible eat-in clientele at this new location.
