I would never go here again. I went there with a group of 4. We all ordered a dish and decided to share. When the dishes arrived, we all scooped a little onto our plates. The waitress asked if everything was okay, with a weird look on her face, and we said fine since none of us had eaten yet. I took a bite of each dish and didn't taste anything that resembled what I ordered so I called the waitress over.   She apoplized and said she switched our dish with another table...hence the weird look when she asked how our meal was. She asked if I would like to have them make me the dish I had ordered. I said yes. Then she said that I would have to pay for both dished (wrong one and origional one I ordered). What?   Yes, we would have to pay for our dish because:  1. We all scooped some food onto our plates leaving the serving platter almost empty 2. We told her everything was fine when she asked.    Everyone at the table scraped that portion of the food back onto the serving dish to appease the manager. She didn't budge on her opinion.   I had taken one bite of everything. I am not sure that everyone else had even tried the dish. So...the platter was almost full again and yet still rejected by them. What's with these people? Can they not afford to make a customer happy after they make a mistake?   The manager refused to give us the right dish without charging us for the wrong dish AND the right dish. Then they took away the wrong dish that they had given us (since I said I didn't want it because I didnt order it!), but said I still had to pay for it. Expensive 1 bite meal!   What kind of place is this?  Don't ever eat here!  And  when a waitress asks you how everything is, be very careful! If you haven't tried everything yet, send her away and tell her to return again when you can give her a comprehensive answer. When you say "fine" at the bamboo grill it is a verbal contract to pay for everything they set down, even if you ordered chicken and they give you pork. Hope you're not Jewish. :)  The waitress should have fessed up her mistake. What if one of us was allergic to one of the ingredients she served us? It's Asian food with sauce...not that easy to tell what's all in there. Plus we recgnized the mistake in just a few bits. It's not like we ate the entire dish and asked for our money back. I am a reasonable person. I would have been very satisfied if they took the other food away and simply gave me what I ordered...and only charged me for what I ordered. It's okay to make mistakes. It's not okay to not make your mistakes right.  If they are this rude to your face imagine what they do behind the scene. A lack of integrity will make it's way into your food. I promise. I have worked in plenty of restaurants. STAY AWAY!

Orange Table is a gem. The food is fresh and unique. The ingredients are familiar but intelligently matched to create dishes that you didn't know you would love. Plus the menu prices are every day affordable.   If you aren't a fan of meats, you might still love their burgers or salads with prosciutto because the quality is excellent.   The juice is fresh squeezed, they make delicious mixed drinks and even more delicious espresso drinks, plus they have an unusual selection of beer.  The OT servers have improved recently, which is appreciated. I was used to having a slightly spacey server, but the food was so good that a little bit of forgetfulness would never stop me from going back. However, that has not been an issue for the past year so. Lastly, there is cool art to look at while you wait for your food, so the atmosphere is fun. Oh and I always see dogs on the patio, so it's a dog friendly place.   I wish they would get a move on with their website so I could give the names of the dishes I like best.  If you are a first timer and hit up OT for breakfast, the Mexican Chocolate Latte drink is amazing. I also tried the SMOCA (raspberry and chocolate) and that was pretty tasty, but nothing beats the Mexican. Coffee Soda is also an unusual treat.   I love the apple pancakes with sour cream, green apples and apple maple syrup. Also delish is the jalapeno pecan pancakes. The hash is winner with the meat crowd and for egg dishes I love the eggs that have a sherry cream sauce with cheese.  They have a prosciutto salad with little pieces of raw garlic. The balsamic dressing is so good, I didn't think it was possible for a vinaigrette to taste that good (and I love vinaigrettes). I could eat that everyday. So much better than expected. My friend ordered it and I wanted to steal it from her.    The hummus plate it fun. Hummus itself is never too exciting, but what they pair it with makes it special. The yogi granola breakfast has really tasty granola and fruit.   The burger that has wine plus manchego cheese is amazing. I want to say Belvedere burger? The best burger ever.  If you like burgers, it has to be tasted. If you don't like burgers (like me) then it still has to be tasted.  I have never been disappointed by any food I have ever ordered at OT. Hope you go there and love it too!

This place is amazing. I love their food and I love their service. The staff are so friendly, they come over and chat with us every time we eat there. They reccommend new thigs for us to try and it's always so delicious that I can't stop eating. It is by far the best Indian food you can get in the area. Try the spinach fritters and the mango lahssi drink(don't know how it is spelled, sorry). The prices are also very reasonable.  The atmosphere is also nice and there is a Sunday brunch whic is decent. The brunch food is not quit as good as the freshly made food, but it is a good value.

The food is amazing. I love the salad with the grapes, and of course, the bruchetta.  I love the atmosphere, the music, the prices, and the service. The servers, bartenders, and manager are all oddly very good looking, which sometimes suggests a bit of snobbery, but not here, they are all fantastically friendly and good looking, so don't be fooled when you see all the sexy people. :)   Definately one of the best places one could choose to eat at when in Phoenix. Brunch is awesome too. The scone with apricot jam, don't miss that, you will keel over with delight. The cucumber honey lemonade is sweet, but pretty fantastic too.
