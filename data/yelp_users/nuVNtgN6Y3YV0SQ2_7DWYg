One of my favorite Chinese food place in the valley, the service was great the food was amazing.  The only thing I didn't like was the location but they have been here 30+ years.

I went here for my sisters birthday, with 5 adults 2 kids and an infant. The food was ok but the service was extremely horrible, we were here at 1 p.m. there was 5 other tables in the restaurant filled the rest was empty, I would assume they would give us decent service for the price of the food but that is asking way to much.

I ordered a soft taco,  hard taco, and the doritos taco and the only taco that was decent was the hard taco. The Doritos one fell apart and was horrible while the soft taco was harder then the hard taco,  and the atmosphere was bad all the employees were in the back yelling and horseplaying around.

The pizza and wings are real good, however the service and atmosphere makes it difficult to continue to go back, but I end up going back since the pizza is good.  Update December 2014... they are by far the worst in customer service. They wouldn't even take the yelp coupon.

I rather go to freemont street and eat on the ground without utensils then go back to this horrible establishment.

Pretty horrible place subway,  firehouse, blimpys, mr goodscents, cousins, Jersey mikes, safeway sub, pretty much any other sub place is 100000 times better, the staff was horrible the food tasted like it was left over from last week and this sub franchise has to be the worst in the valley.

I went for a shave and haircut and it was a decent haircut and I requested a straight razer shave and they said no. Also the atmosphere was horrible, the music, and the ladies were speaking spanish non stop also there was a kid of the worker here messing around. I will not return here nor I suggest anyone come here.

I have been to this location a lot and have never had any problems. It is a good ice cream store.

I have been going to Ultrastar for years and this buyout is a shame. Digiplex does not offer a rewards card nor popcorn card. If there was another theatre near by I would go.

They purchased Digiplex, the best part is the rewards card can be changed to Carmike Cinemas!
