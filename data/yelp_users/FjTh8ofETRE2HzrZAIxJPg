The person that answered the phone and took my order was really polite and made sure to get all the info correct. Delivery was fast. Delivery driver was very polite and friendly. The food was great. I got the lemon chicken , crab puffs and egg flower soup. The soup was alright (I'm super picky about my egg flower soup) everything else was absolutely amazing!

My boyfriend had been telling me that we should go there, as I had never been. Well, on our first visit what do I find in my lemongrass chicken?! A hair. I went to bring it to someone's attention and was offered a replacement dish and it was taken off the bill. No apology was received. Not to mention their service was absolutely awful. Never coming here again. Ever.

I am beyond displeased with this pizza hut. I had an order placed (a friend from Italy had placed the order) Not only did I not get my pizza, but I didn't even get a call. Now they won't replace the order. How fantastic is that? Not at all. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PIZZA HUT EVER

Everyone at Lane Splitters are super nice, and they definitely know their way around a motorcycle. So if you need some repairs or need some mods done to your bike I highly recommended Lane Splitters!
