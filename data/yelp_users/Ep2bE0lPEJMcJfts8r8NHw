I wouldnt call this a salsa club. Id call it just plainly a club with some latin flavor?  it looked ok, i liked the outside patio?  it was crowded. but i left outta there wanting to go to a real latin club.  the bartender was the best though, she knew exactly what we wanted and the drinks were mixed well and after we came back she still remembered what we had.  I give her an A plus. I more than likely will not go back.

Would I go again? No.  i agree with some of the other reviews. chips needed salt, food was not fresh, beans were runny...i had the cheese enchiladas, they were ok...  my husband got a booger in his sprite. and the manager kept standing in front or around our table...not very comfortable.

The food was delicious, portions are big. Decent pricing. As for the establishment, it's clean, it's pretty and it smells good. I'll have to remember to try some of the other yelped recommendations in food choice. Thanks guys...

The coffee here is exquisite and the bran muffins even though delicious a bit too big. so, you get more for your money?  my favorite new place. oh, and the speed of service is wonderful when  your on the run.

we had been to the one in phoenix and the Cuban sandwich was awesome. so we tried the one from here in chandler. and honestly I don't think ill do that again. the lady that took our order was really unusually slow...two people got served before she was done with our order. the sandwich itself left much to be desired of. thanks but no thanks.

the restaurant was nearly empty at lunch time 12:30. this shouldve told me something, even though when i got there i had to go to the back of the rest. for someone to help me. i finally sat down, and ordered one taco, one chile relleno and one enchilada. let me tell you the girl brought the plate and it was so hot i think the plate had either been placed in the microwave or in the oven. the taco and the chile were deep fried and both were dripping with so much oil it was disgusting all i could taste was oil. the enchilada was really salty and the lettuce was basically a spoon full. the presentation of the plate was horrendous there was so much enchilada sauce on the plate it got into the chile relleno and the taco. the salsa i got with the chips was watery and it seemed to me it was not fresh at all, seemed more like canned. i have had many great foods at low eateries..this place charged me 15.00 for this simple plate. it was such an outrage i did not finish it nor gave a tip. i will never return nor will i recommend. this place is a disgrace to mexican food, especially labeled "home made" unless "home made" is code for crappy. taco bell cooks better.

Dr. Cipriano cancelled on me 2 hours before my procedure, so I rescheduled for the next day. Then 3 hours later they left me a message to reschedule and I couldn't call them back so when I couldn't make it to my appointment. They called me to tell me they were keeping my 100 deposit for my procedure as a penalty. 100 dollars folks! I don't know many ppl whom have 100 to throw around. The service was horrible, the xray tech assistant wanted me to bite down hard on the plastic to take pictures. I was in pain and left that office worse. My gums were bleeding. Word of caution.  DO NOT GO TO ANY SOUTHWEST DENTAL CENTERS.

not gonna say they're all horrible but some of the people here at the counter are completely rude, full of attitude and down right IGNORANT. they need people skills training. But then again it is not just my personal experience that LA FITNESS does not care for their image nor for their current members.

this place is awesome, i ordered four shrimp rolls and 6 California rolls (i didn't notice the number in parenthesis). lol it was alot and was prepared to pay a hefty bill. i sat at the bar the chef was very friendly and just watching him do his magic with the sushi was awesome. i got my salad and soup and edamame and a hot towel thrown at me by the chef, im guessing for cleaning? is this a custom? it was cool though...the shrimp on my rolls was so tender, possibly the best cooked shrimp i have ever tried. the presentation was ethnic as you expect, the service and food were excellent. guess how much my bill was? for 10 rolls, soup, salad, edamame and2 iced teas? 9 dollars. not bad. will be back.

30 dollars for lunch!!!!!  My husband and I came in for lunch and ordered from the lunch menu, even pointed it out on the menu. Waitress came back to get our order again. The menus were gone, she had taken them but we repeated our order. We ate, the food was good...but when we got the bill she had given us regular prices rather than the lunch specials we had ordered. We pointed it out to her her mistake, she then told us WE should have been clear we wanted the lunch special. That we got more food than the lunch special and we had to pay it. She refused to give us the lunch special prices, making our bill almost double. And then had the nerve to tell us that the next time to be very specific and to remeber that the wings are 35 cents on tuesdays. I paid it, but she got no tip and they lost a customer...

this chic was there last night, tasting the awesomeness of their sweet pork.  the plates they used reminded me of a horrid restaurant (called chino bandido - avoid at all gastronomic costs). But the food was good. tables needed to be cleaned, i had to clean mine, and several people around us were doing the same, floor was dirty also from food people were throwing in the floor to clean their tables. will return. a bit pricey, but hey isn't everything going up but the wages now a days?

Im an avid coffee drinker, twice a day every day.  I was hesitant in the beginning because, i had tried they're regular coffee before and i thought it was too weak. however, if you try the specialties like the Double Torture or cocomo ...SMALL, you wont need any more....this coffee is great, and the people are so friendly.  this is Starbucks greatest competition in my point of view.

THESE PEOPLE MUST HAVE BEEN PAID TO REVIEW THIS GYM WITH MORE THAN 1 STAR AND SAY IT IS AWESOME. THIS IS THE COMPLETE CONTRARY. I was there may be a week ago and this DISGUSTING gym  had 4 broken treadmills out of 12. *(really????!) some didnt even have broken signs posted. 2 broken bikes out of 6. the dirtiest (if that were a word) equipment ive seen. hair, sweat and sticky crap all over the buttons. the bathroom trash cans were overflowing with paper, the bathroom stalls empty on TP. and where were the cleaning crew? oh you mean the guy walking around the gym with a trash can talking to people, while staring you down??? yeah...well now you know why the place is filthy.

A prison gives better service than this place and possibly food too.   i needed to get my stomach pumped after eating here. And you would too if you eat here, your stomach will hurt like hell!!! the soup was a disgusting glop. the rice was not fresh, the noodles were ehj...ive had better Chinese at a jack in the box. and after the horrible waitress and customer service. I DID NOT PROVIDE A TIP as i see a tip as a reflection of service and this place, lacked it all completely. well the cashier threw me the receipt, because of this, no words were exchanged, she was just pissed i did not give a tip. if i wasn't such a calm person, i would have reached over that counter and slapped her. however, this is all they get from me. a bad review and i will never think of this place again.  trust me JACK IN THE BOX has better Chinese.

After being frustrated with seeing other doctors and their lack of professionalism. I decided to Google best ob/gun doctor in az and this group came up. Appointments are a bit far, so don't expect something the next day or week. However, when I was finally seen, I was completely happy, they're all so caring and professional, from the receptionist to the nurses, the assistants but above all the doctor.  I've seen dr. Mayer and dr. Jackson and they both listened to my problems and concerns and best of all I dont feel like I'm being manipulated into being a guinea pig, I feel genuinely cared for.. I'm very happy with this group and don't think I will ever see another group.  Btw...I felt I'll and called and they got me a same day appointment. So I think it depends on the situation.

I rarely give 5 stars. .so this is a treat.  Let me tell you the crab melt along with the Caribbean salad was so delicious I felt guilty eating it. If you're like me, don't believe it till you try it...you won't regret it. Service is always excellent.

our waiter Martin was really nice and provided excellent service. I ordered the sweedish crepes combo with eggs and bacon. the eggs and bacon were great, the crepes however, tasted like they had been cooked in a pan where they cooked other foods.and they they tasted a little burnt but they didn't look burnt...so I imagine the taste transfered from another food that had previously cooked there. I would return it was a good experiance overall

Update:  ordered a ham and cheese breakfast burrito the cost was 5. I told them to add beans. The charged an extra 86 cents. With taxes it came out to 6.27 they're tax bracket is a little high. I wanted to pay with my card so the charge an extra 50 cents which is double of the normal fee even though because I'm spending more than 3 dollars their fee isn't as big as the normal fee. So if you do the math they should have charged me 6.77...well then they taxed me again ...so my cheap little breakfast burrito was costing me 8.00...I told them about their mistake and they didn't want to return the difference. So after the food was done. I told them to cancel the order and return my money since they had charged it before even telling me all these ridiculous fees and over charges. Went down the street to a high end restaurant got the same burrito for 4 dollars.

We found this place through yelp, love holes in the wall, personalized service intimate and cozy...nope! Not this place. We were rudely greeted (if you can call it a greeting) by the owner, who had an attitude,  told us to order right away or move out the way. I would have understood if the place was packed and we took longer than a minute to check out the menu. But nope! No one was behind us and we had just arrived.   We told him we were ready and aparently this bothered him since he asked us 3 questions in this order. 1. Is this your first time here? We said yes. 2. Do you have any questions?  Not yet, but we're ready to order. And #3 you should have questions,  this is your last chance.  We looked at each other thinking is this guy on drugs?? Cause he was hyped and angry....well who knows...we ordered the gyros. Don't care for the food. It was bland and they force you to add sides you didn't want. Who puts rice on a gyro???  I've had great Mediterranean and that was not it. Although bland the food was cooked right and there were some healthy choices. I would consider this place probably a modernized or westernized Chipotle style Mediterranean restaurant. So if you want classic, look else where.

Came here cause it's close, but quickly realized why the place is empty. I had a refill and a pedicure.  The lady did my refill was very rough,  kept tugging at my arm and even asked me to sit a different way to make her more comfortable,  the drill had waaaaaay to much power,  she hurt my cuticles. ..I kept looking at her as if we were in a horror film and she was the butcher with the drill out to get me. Nail polish selection is horrible, don't bother with it after I regreted my first selection  I asked them to change it and they said no.  My nails look butchered and the painting even worse. My feet were done by the man and he was rough and the massage was like a minute long cause they keep watching the football game.  Needless to say the towels..oh gawd....the towels...another horror flick reference inserted here. I'm sitting here writing this review thinking I won't tip.

1 star ...not for the coffee. I love the coffee and the new Chai tea is awesome. I hate this specific location...I've been here every Tuesday and Wednesday for the past 4 months and every single time I dread, horrifically dread coming here because I've literally sat 10 minutes in my car to get up to the window...I understand a little chat ..and it happens in all the Dutch Bros,  but this one is ridiculous. So I stopped tipping. And when they see I gave no tip it's a total flip of the coin in trying to get me out asap. I'm sorry but a tip for me means I'm satisfied...and if I've now put it up here its cause it's not happened once or twice...it's because your consistent in the loooong eternal wait lines. I might just go back to Starbucks.

With a appointment I'm always waiting 2 hours to be seen. They place in the room so you don't know what's going on. No other patients in the office but the N.P. had actually left for a lunch date. Wt..? I was there since 10am with an appointment. Not the first time either...they leave you waiting for hours before they see you, the doctors or N.P. are usually surfing the Internet doing nothing. Go on a Sunday and they have some kinda Sunday church service playing on TV and the NP singing church music. The service is by far the worst. On a physical the NP didn't bother to ask me before she pulled down my sons shorts and fondled his penis and pulled back the foreskin. Extremly pissed. Last time I come here. I recommend you do to.
