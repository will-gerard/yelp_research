Very large. Went here for the Super Bowl and surprisingly it was kept very clean! Nice die toon from one floor to another through all of the endless escalators. The outside is also very appeasing with its looks.

Staff was less then thrilled to be at work. Everyone seemed to have a attitude that wasn't exactly inviting.  The location of this Starbucks is inside a mall which is good, but I think they should have gotten a bigger space, it is very cramped and where you pick your drinks up is maybe a yardstick long against a wall.   The drinks were good, but we waited a decent amount of time to receive them and with the unhappy staff it just wasn't worth the time.

Eh. This rainforest cafe has a lot to be desired. Came here while we were in town for the Super Bowl and wasn't impressed. Our server less then serviced us and the food seemed to take forever to come out and there was less then 5 tables taken in the place. Usually I love rainforest but this one I think I'll skip if I'm ever in town again!

I'm a die hard Cheesecake Factory fan. That being said this isn't their greatest location. Yes, it's on south side, but if you plan on doing more then going to AE, Sur La Table or Houghbrah House there's not to much to do. There used to be tons of shops/ other restaurants right in the surrounding blocks but since then has seen a down turn.  It's quite a far walk to the "real" south side ( all the bars) but I suppose in the summer months you could make it happen. The food is the same food you'd get at any other location, good size, good taste for the price.  Since this is the only location in downtown Pittsburgh it does get quite busy, so put your name on the list and have a drink in the bar area while you wait! The high tops in the bar are first come first serve, so elbow your way into one! :)

Came here on a Pirates game day about 2 hours before the game. Luckily we found some seats at the bar to eat & drink( the wait for a table was over a hour).  We ordered a few appetizers and beers. It only took about 15-20 min to get our food, I thought much longer since their wait was so long. Our waitress was on top of everything, our glasses never were empty. Food was aright, pretzel sticks were AMAZING, get those if you're getting a app. The bones less wings- are really not wings, but chicken tenders with wing sauce. Buffalo chicken flat bread was good. THEY HAVE BANANA BREAD BEER!!! GET IT!  The inside of the restaurant is obviously sports themed. LOUD atmosphere, there were children there, it's family friendly if you want to bring your kid to a bar.  Bathrooms are ok, little dark.

Let me be clear, 4 stars is for CRYSTAL, not mcfaddens as a whole. If you stop in and Crystal isn't working walk your ass right out that door because there is no reason for you to be in that place.  This bar lives off of baseball/ football games and maybe a crowd if there's a concert going on at AE. That is all they are there for. They usually have game day specials like 4 bottles of IC for $12, which isn't bad considering that the are so close to both ball fields, but don't expect much more. Food takes minimum 30 min to get out, so cross that right off your list if you're in a rush. If you do have time hey, the food isn't too shabby.  Every bartender prrrobably shouldn't be a bartender, but then the beer gods throw you Crystal. She is this tiny dark haired girl who knows her shit! She remembered everyones drink order in my sight when they wanted a new drink she was on top of it and wasn't a bitch about it. Crystal we don't know why you stay at mcfaddens but hats off to you, you're the bomb.com

we stayed here during superbowl weekend and I would say one of the better non- chain hotels I've been to.  guest services- Very polite, upbeat. They were just friendly( gave us scissors to cut something) there's always someone at the front desk which was nice. At night the employees who work in the dinning area were also kind and helpful. Housekeeping takes their time though, it was almost 5 one night and our room still wasn't done.    hotel room- clean, updated. Ours had a mini fridge, two beds, desk, full bath/ shower and a large closet, big tv and porch.   lobby / dinning area-clean, updated and the food was AWESOME. EVERY single day you get a FREE hot breakfast, hot dinner and 3 free drinks( beer or mixed)whhhhaaatttt? Talk about amazing!   pool-it was rainy when we were there so we didn't get to test it out, but after looking at the amenities, it's seems like a very nice pool area. They also have a small gym that looked useful.   parking- They do have a large parking area, that's not shared with another hotel or restaurant. There always seemed to be spots.   relativity to attractions - I would stay at this hotel if only I needed to be close to the airport. it's kind of far to taxi to places near, and walking would not be a option.  Overall I had a gray experience and if I ever need to stay close to the Phoenix airport I'll be sure to stay here.

Food was delicious. Great portion sizes and it tasted fresh! I would defiantly come here again, maybe sit outside next time ( we sat inside).   Our waiter was very attentive and knew the menu which is what it should be everywhere. He even offered me what I got for lunch. it was very good.  The location was good, close to everything in the city center, parking is under most buildings.

If you're in their terminal, eat here!!! We caught some breakfast here the morning after the Super Bowl and they were PACKED. We only had to wait maybe 10 minutes to be seated. Our server was great, got us drinks and took our Oder in no time. Our food took about 10-15 min and was really good! I'd like to try lunch or dinner if I'm ever in the area again.
