I saw so many great reviews from this place so we decided to try it. I had very high hopes. I loved the atmosphere and the kids loved the Texas trivia game, but that's about the only good thing I could say. My steak came out and was not cooked the way I asked. They took it back to fix it. The steak had no flavor and was just covered in butter. I thought it was just my steak, but even the kids didn't eat there's.  The waitress asked my daughter of something was wrong since she only ate a few bites so I explained she didn't like it. She just said ok and walked away. The shrimp was good, but pricey. The bugers were just ok. At the end they were pushing for us to take it home since we ate almost none of it. We politely declined and she still came out with boxes trying to get us to take it. The chicken fried chicken that my daughter's friend ordered  was another item thatcwas horrible.  The gravy had no flavor and when I tasted it the piece I had was so fatty. I pulled the skin out of it and it didn't even look fully cooked. Maybe we were there on an off night, who knows, but for me it was very pricey for the quality of food we recieved.  Nothing had flavor so I guess that's why all the sauces and spices are in the table.

I have to say I love this place for a quick getaway.  The service is always amazing. Don, Casey,  Aj and Jesus are awesome at the pool bar. They are attentive,  fun and do what they can to make your stay amazing. The rooms are always clean and their beds are so comforable. Ask for a room in the north building as it's closer to everything. The food at the pool is good too. The sunday buffett at the cafe is amazing. They have a waterslide for the kids and adults too. Lots of fun. I love that they have a side of the pool more for adults and it's the only side you can smoke in. The side with the slide is non-smoking as it's geared more for kids. Great rates, lots of fun and a comfortable stay.  I highly suggest this resort.

This is a wonderful hotel. I've stayed a few times and love the location.  May restaurants nearby. The staff here is very friendly.  Alexa at the front desk is amazing. So helpful and friendly.   She printed us directions and greeted us everytime we came in.  The rooms have recently been remodeled and are really nice.  I love that they have a bistro open for breakfast and lunch.  They have starbucks too which is a big plus.

Nice hotel in a good location. Good service. Newly remodeled with a very modern feel. The only negative is I went down on a Saturday morning and was told they have a limited menu because breakfast stops at 9:30 am. I only arrived a few minutes after 9:30. I've been to many other courtyards and on the weekend's they usually serve until 11. It would've been nice to know this at check in.

Has to be the best burger. Add a fried egg to make it even better. Love the fat fries and onion rings too. But its the burgers you have to try. Everything tastes so fresh. Their is a size for everyone. If you think you can try the XXXL challenge. My brother did in April (a little disappointed that is picture isn't up as promised with the challenge). They have shakes and an outdoor bar as well. The best fat burger we've been too!

Stayed here last month.  I have since talked to guest services and was given a 50.00 credit for my stay.  Makes up for some of the terrible service.  First the good- the pool area is great, but you can't take anything in not even water.  Brand Lounge is amazing.  It's small, but great music and the best service we had was here. The bad- There is no wifi in the rooms only the lobby, the rooms are dated (but i could live with that since I wasn't there much), I had a smoking room and the ashtray was taken and not replaced, the service all around was terrible from the place we ate to the concierge desk.  If you're looking for a cheap place to stay this would work.  But don't expect service with that.

A beautiful hotel and excellent service. Nick from the front was very accommodating to all of our needs. We were there for a cheer competition and of course the girls forgot stuff so he got us needed items and suggested places to pick up the rest. The rooms were very nice and extremely clean. The only reason I gave it four stars is the parking situation.  No onsite parking except vallet which is 30.00 a night. Makes it difficult when staying downtown, but I'm assuming this is the case with most of the hotels in the area. The shop there has all most everything you could need and having the cafe is very convenient.  The food from toom service is excellent and the Terrance and pool area are a great place to gather with friends or relax. I definitely will be back and highly  recommend this hotel.

Stopped here while in Mesa for work based on the yelp reviews. Needed something quick before our class. When I pulled up I was a little worried. No cars and didn't look like much, but the reviews were great so I had to try it. I had the special,  a 5 inch philly cheese steak and hot wings. I liked it all. I ordered mine with cheese whiz,  but it had provolone when I got it. Didn't have time to change it. It was still good. I will have to try it with cheese whiz next time. Prices are good and the portions are just right.

Best hotel I've been to in Vegas.  The service is always amazing.  Nichole at the concierge desk is great.  She will go out of her way to help you.  The pool area is beautiful and the rooms, well they are the best I've seen on the strip.  Really spacious and a modern decor.  The casino has so many slot machine options and a great amount of table games.  There are several restaurants and bars.  Haze night club is here too.  You really never have to leave and you won't want to.

Great place to come watch any game or just to come eat great food in a great atmosphere.  The Po' boy sandwich here is hands down the best I've had.  The food portions are big so come hungry.  We usually do the bucket of beers.  So many great food options here. The only issure we've ever had is with the fried fish.  There were bones in it.  But the manager came right over and apologized and took it off of our bill.

I heard of this and had to try it. Korean mexican fusion oh my it was delicious. A little mom n pop place that serves huge portions of great food at an even better price. At table of 5 and we all ordered plates 2 appetizers and an extra plate of rice and we only paid 65.00. Anything with the bulgogi and you can't go wrong. The bulgogi flautas and the chicken fried rice were my favorites.  We got lucky and got a table quick but it soon filled up and there was a wait. You must try this place.

Was excited to try a new burger place while in casa grande for work. I'd heard about these butter burgers so figured it was time. I had the cheddar bacon butter burger and on the cashiers suggestion the cheese curds. I wasn't impressed.  It wasn't horrible, but wasn't good. The cheese curds were nothing special. I didn't enjoy them. The girls that helped me were nice, but I won't be having another burger there. If I must go back I will try the custard.

I really like this place. So many good burgers to choose from. The PB &J burger is something everyone should try. You won't be disappointed! For a burger place I really have to recommend the pasta too. Amazing. The mac and cheese is so yummy. Their appetizers are good as well. I haven't had anything I didn't like. As a side try the Jamaican corn, wow. When in Scottsdale this is a must.  Their brownies are amazing. Such a fun laid back atmosphere that everyone can enjoy. Great food, great drinks, great service! Wish we had one in Tucson!

Let me start with saying that Fat burger is the best burger and  inside the service has always been amazing, but here at Fat bar the service is horrible.  We sat for over 10 minutes and didn't get a waitress until I asked for one. They walked by and looked at us, but not a word. I will always come back because of the food, but the service outside made me realize it's best to eat inside. They have plenty of staff and it's not busy so there is no excuse. They staff spends too much time socializing with eachother.  A couple of them must be dating because they were kissing in the corner by our table and didn't even care that we were sitting waiting. Horrible way to run a business.

Came here while in town for a country concert.  What better way to start our day.  Everything was great.  The service was amazing from the time we walked in the door.  We were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table.  You pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what you've drank.  The food we had was great.  The whiskey burger was my favorite.  For you country fans this is a must when in Scottsdale!

The empanadas are amazing! So full of flavor and we had excellent service. A great place to go for a light snack or order more qith sides for a filling meal. Try them all. We had about 8 different ones and all of them were great. The atmosphere is relaxing and inviting.  A casual place to enjoy some good food and a beer. A must when in Mesa! We will be back. The price is a bit high for the size, but the flavor makes it worth every penny! My favorite was the black bean and cheese.

I was so excited to find a togos in Phoenix.  I grew up on togos in Gilroy, Ca. A great childhood memory.  A great quality sandwich shop that I highly recommend.  The best pastrami sandwhich I've ever had. Their ingredients taste so fresh. Lots of meat unlike some places. I will be honest that I love the pastrami sandwich so much that I haven't ordered much else from their menu. When you love something why change it. For those of you who haven't heard of togos go try it. You won't be disappointed!

Amazing! I'm not a golfer, but I ended up loving it. I went with my family who loves golf and we planned on staying an hour since I don't golf. Over 6 hours later and we left only because we had a far drive. This place has it all down right. The food is amazing. I didn't expect it to be so good. The brisket tacos and chorizo sliders are my favorite.  Good quality food and so many unique items. I highly recommend this place for people of all ages. My teens loved it. The bays are nice and roomy.  There was 7 of us and each bay can have up to 10 people. You must try it. We will be back again soon.

Amazing Mexican and Asian infusion with good service.  We saw this as we were driving and I'm so glad we stopped.  Everything was amazing and we tried a lot. Order many plates and share because everything we had is worth trying. Blanca was our server and was a great help with suggestions and making sure we had everything we needed. She was so patient while we kept adding on more and more. Come hungry, there will me so much for you to try. The mexican street corn with popcorn is amazing. The steak pepita torta was mouth watering. The rolla chingon was amazing and unique. The korean tacos are a must. Love the atmosphere here.  A very eclectic place with lots to choose from including drinks. The loaded mule was refreshing. The tres leches cake I'm eating right now and all I can say is Wow!
