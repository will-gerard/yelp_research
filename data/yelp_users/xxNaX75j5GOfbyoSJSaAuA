Good wings, good pizza. I was really impressed with how fast they get through their orders on a busy Friday. The only thing that they are missing is beer. I know I am completely bias on this issue but pizza and beer just make the meal perfect. Overall, great food.

I am overwhelmed by the reviews for this place. I have been to the establishment four or five times and I am shocked that it has such a high rating, perhaps it is because there have been no recent ratings.  Yes, the beer selection is decent and the prices are pretty good as well. The people who work there are also mostly friendly and helpful, mostly.  I for one am not someone who thinks that duct tape on the wall and water damage is really a selling point as some people have said. I am not scared away and there is not a rodent problem but still, the place is not very appeasing to the eye.  I am most disappointed by the many people chiming in on how great of a pool hall this is. There are a lot of tables, yes, but they run a gummut of disrepair and from what I can see more on the lower end. The pool sticks are abysmal, the last two times I was there the people I went with all had to share the only non-warped, non-cracked or broken one we could find.   I don't avoid it, and I am sure I will be back, but this is really a place that my friends and I go to out of convenience of location than anything else.

Essentially this is the best of a lil' Mexican food cart placed inside a building. Seeing that it is on the same corner as a Taco Bell amuses me. Look at the reviews of this place. It really is that good. The owner is also very friendly. The carnitas and cabeza are definitely my favorite.

This is the best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand. I have been here now a few times and as I sit here on my lunch break eating leftovers I decided to take a look at the reviews and write my own.  I see a few common complaints in the reviews that I would like to address. The first is the price for the amount. I will agree that the price here is a bit higher than most of the other places to get Thai food I have encountered, and I have gone to many a Thai food place. That said, the few extra dollars a plate is largely offset in my books by how great the food is. I have seen some people say that the portions are less then they expect and I have not experienced that at all.  Another thing that I would mention in regards to the price is the atmosphere. When encountering Thai kitchens I have found it is pretty hit or miss how nice they are on the inside. Several places I have been to I would only ever order take out from rather than sitting in the rundown or dirty restaurant with less than ideal service. Yupha's is where I go when I want to sit down and have a nice meal with someone. It is clean and nice inside, I took my mother to try Thai food this week here.  I have also had only excellent service the times I have been to Yupha's. Very knowledgeable and friendly servers that have never been short or rude.

This is the only place outside of Thailand that I have ever found khao soi, they have it listed as curry noodles but if you ask the man who works there he will know what you mean.  All of the food here is excellent, in fact, the place gets five stars from me for food and friendliness.   I recommend taking this food home as the place is small and gets overcrowded easily. As some people have said, there is often only one or maybe two people working here so calling it in means better service really.

Received great service and was even able to fix the paint on my Subaru. We did have to drop my vehicle off for a few days at his house because he needed the time to work on it. Be aware, if you have to go to his place, google maps sends you way off, so you are better off just asking for directions.

My wife and I choose Blue Chip Auto Glass because of all the great reviews, now it's my turn to leave on.  Prompt, courteous, and professional, everything you would want from any business. Dylan came out, took care of our windshield, and now we are set. Great work, when we need help again, we will be sure to call Blue Chip.

I was taught by my dad at a young age that no matter where I live I need to take the time to find an auto mechanic I can trust. Ron's was not that mechanic the first two years I lived here. I had found another place that was also highly recommended on yelp.  After a few years my car needed some more serious work than usual. I took it to several places to make sure all the diagnosis lined up and to see what the price would be. Jason at the front gave me a quote that was 20% cheaper than anywhere else and was very honest and helpful.  Since then I have taken my cars to get quotes elsewhere every time they need something more serious than an oil change and every time Ron's has the best rate. I have come to trust their judgement and have recommended them to my family and friends whenever asked.  The people who work here are polite, trustworthy and know their trade. If you live in the area and you need work done on your car you should certainly get a quote from them before making a final decision on where to go.

Upon my third visit to Postino's it was so busy that the wait was over an hour to get a table for two at 9 PM on a weekday. Postino's only takes reservations for parties over 8. Called the next day after making arrangements to bring a group of 10 to the restaurant and was informed that since they already had a few other big tables with reservations we were out of luck. They suggested we show up early and wait. I asked if they had room for us and they said "yes but we do not like having that many big parties with reservations." Why have a policy that makes you have a big party to make a reservation if you will not give such a reservation even if there is room for one? I am glad the establishment is doing well but I feel that this is unfair service.

Gonna have to jump on the bandwagon here, this place is great. Wife and I checked it out last night and were very impressed.  Their happy hour is outstanding with great deals on drinks. Their signature drinks are delicious, try the good goddess. Beer and wine selection is good as well.  We decided to go all out for our meal and ate three appetizers and, after more drinks and waiting to get hungry again, had two entrees. The appetizers we tried, bruschetta, chorizo sliders, and the tomato goat cheese tart were excellent. The truffle mac n' cheese entree was outstanding and the pork tenderloin was also very good.  On top of the food, the service was outstanding. We were lucky to be there when the owner of Arizona Distilling Company was there and the owner of Barrelhouse was buying drinks for people to try their bourbon! Best Thursday night I can remember.

As bars go, this is certainly my favorite. I have been five times before deciding to write a review.  The food is great, for bar food fare obviously. I have had several sandwiches, all were tasty. The macaroni and cheese they brag about is also great. I am not a big fan of ordering burgers but my friends have enjoyed them.  The beer list is extensive and excellent! Just as important the servers I have had have been very knowledgeable and helpful with the items. Speaking of servers, the service here has always been great.  The last plus is the establishments willingness to give a fan of hockey a tv. Yup, as one of the few obsessive fans of hockey in the valley I really appreciate an establishment that has the tvs to spare indulging me.   Overall, I have not found a better bar establishment in the valley and you can expect to see me return.

There really is nothing more I can say, I am, and since they opened have been, a Wilderness Brewery groupie.   My friend and I were driving down the street about a year and a half ago and saw the brewery. Walked up and the doors were locked and we noticed a sign that they were not open yet. As we walked away the owner opened the door and said that if we wanted beer they could serve us.  From that day forward I have been there more times than I can think. I am there to try all their beers, which I will say are not always my favorite but damn am I glad they are doing something different than the standard four beers most breweries do. I could drink the Lil' Guy all day long. Their Refuge IPA is steller, and I love all their stouts and porters.  Bar food here is top notch. I never considered myself a burger and fries guy until Wilderness brewery. I find myself craving their beer cheese and pulled pork fries all the damn time.  My picture is on the wall. I bring everyone I can there whenever I can. I cannot recommend this place enough.

I have been looking for a good affordable pizza as so many gourmet pizza places are out of the price range for most pizza circumstances such as a party. This place has good pizza at great prices. I will never order from a chain again.

I am breaking my rule of never reviewing a place after only visiting once for this place.  I like the decor and set up of this place. The food was good and the service on a busy Friday night was prompt and attentive. I like that they supplement their beer list with other great craft brews to be sure that they have something for everyone without feeling pressured to brew what everyone else already has.  All this being said, while I was there I witnessed possibly the best customer service I have seen at a restaurant last Friday, which is what made me make a review. About 7 PM they announced a special limited tapping from another brewery in the valley. The table next to me had just cashed out and were leaving. The man asked the owner, who had just made the announcement and was now at a table eating and drinking with friends, if he could have a sample of the beer before he left. The owner left his dinner, went to the bar and poured the man a sample of the beer.  I see a few posts here bashing the customer service and so I decided that I needed to post that we had the opposite experience on a busy night. Everyone was great, the food was good and I will be going back.
