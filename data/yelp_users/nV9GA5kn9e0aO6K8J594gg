The place is clean, the ladies there are so nice.  Lee took good care of my pedicure and manicure.  I'll be back here for sure.

It was my first experience going to a salon close by to where we lived, since our move from North Phoenix. I went over to this salon trusting the raving reviews about them and I am so glad I did. Not only is Noah an excellent hair stylist, he is very personable and didn't pressure me at all on purchasing products. He shows that he truly cares about the happiness of his clients. I am in love with my hair! I felt very relaxed and comfortable at VOLR. I loved the ambiance of the salon and the other staff were also friendly! For the level of customer service I received, the price was well worth it.  I am definitely going back!

what a cool bar!!!  Even if you are not a smoker, you have to enjoy your drinks on their patio at the back of the bar.  Its so romantic with the vines, trees and lights!   Not to worry because if you pick the corner tables, nobody is blowing smoke in your face!  The appetizers are de-licious (my faves are the Southwest Chipotle Rolls and Onions Rings) and they have the most amazing Long Island Ice Tea.  Its very smooth - not strong at all.  Don't forget to try their Sex Wax drink - Unbelievable!

The mighty cup is this nice cozy little coffee shop filled with lots of arts and crafts from local artists.  The whole atmosphere is bursting with creativity and its so cozy that you'd feel like you are having your cup of tea or coffee right at home!!  I was there Thursday night which is their Poetry Reading night!  Different poets or poetry enthusiasts mingle, read and enjoy the wonders of poetry!  I enjoyed it alot!  Try their Chai latte - its de-licious!! :)

Nothing special. "Dingy" looking ambience. Cheap futons. Service lacks. It is taking a long time to bring out the coal.... 10 mins later I'm still waiting for our coal. He is going out to smoke instead.
