Food is over priced $20 for a burger we walked out before we ordered . Hear its sub par and looking at other reviews not surprising.  I live around the corner would love to love this place but just No!!!

Brought a party of 4 here for lunch but we never made it in the door . I was wearing camo and our party was rejected by the bouncer at the front door . We were told that camo is not welcome into this establishment. Just want to give our soldiers who protect our country that you are not welcome here . It's a shame that el hefe welcomes drunken frat boys over our military.

my first time to the Pita Kitchen . I had the beef gyro it was really good hot and fresh , large portions the fries were hot and crispy . brought my wife a gyro with chicken she loved hers also. if you are a fan of good food I definitely recommend pita kitchen . I could write down 10,000 word review but you will know it all with just one bite. met one of the owners Ramium he was really nice and very attentive made our lunch spectacular.
