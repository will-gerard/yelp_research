pretty good gyro cooked on rotisserie as it should be they told me it is 75/25 % lamb/beef. they have a combo special with fried they let me substitute lemon potatoes, which were quite good.. reasonable prices.

fantastic!!! Pittsburgh is just like Rio de Janeiro , well without the palm trees, warm sunny climate, gorgeous beaches, and gorgeous Brazilian women .. but otherwise the same, both cities are hilly and have a funicular. OK in Rio it goes up a huge mountain bigger than any in the eastern US, but hey u gotta live with what u got!!  this is actually a very nice way to commute up and down , much easier, faster, and less stressful then driving; as the drive up to the top or down is very roundabout and takes a long time..  $2.50 each way or you can buy roundtrip ticket $5 cash only.

$3 drafts and half off small plates from 5-7 weekdays and you get a great view of downtown pirate burgh and front row seats for the passing coal trains!! bruschetta pomodora with shrimp was nice as was veggie flatbread (flatbread is a euphisism for very thin crust pizza, let's just call it pizza) .. my bartender , an energetic brunette, was friendly and efficient.. they have 3 or 4 local beers on tap in addition to the standards.. young professional looking crowd at happy hour ..

fantastic view of downtown you gotta see!  driving up here is  a royal pain, as is driving a lot of places in hilly pittsburgh. you need to find on street parking nearby which seems to be a bit tricky.. run or ride your bike up here and avoid driving and parking hastles!

the Shan tribe noodle dish is great, lots of chili and garlic, pretty spicy I loved it. Owners are from this ethnic group in Myanmar (what the British decided to call Burma in the colonialism period) so this is their native food. The menu is very diverse with dishes from various Asian nations. Low prices, very friendly people. The Burmese vegetable soup is a good choice also!!

Pretty nice if small modern art museum and architecturally somewhat intereresting. The restrooms have a cool design. It only takes about an hour to look at everything but at $8 it is relatively reasonable. I saw the Giacometti exhibit here it was quite well arranged and documented. Be sure to walk out on the second floor balcony to check out the sculptures there and the view of the immediate area of downtown

the theme here is that they rotate the menu to reflect cuisines of different countries the US has conflicts with . for now it is Iranian food.. kookoo e-sabzi is WONDERFUL!!! love Iranian food. sharbat drink is quite good also. prices are reasonable. sitting outside in the park is quite nice on those days when Pittsburgh has good weather (LOL). so yeah, it would be a lot better if they were in San Diego...

A rather sterile, utilitarian "park", mostly concrete, a fountain and a path, set in the midst of parking lots and uninterestingoffice buildings on the edge of downtown. probably a good place for local office workers to eat lunch, but not really much more than that. this park nedds some statuary, some modern art, and more vegetation. maybe a bonsai garden??? a park like this in the middle of downtown would seem much cooler than this, perhaps it was an afterthought in city planning.

Small but very nice oasis of green and tranquility a short walk from the downtown skyrises. Kind of a narrow park but surprisingly quiet in here given the proximity to downtown and there is a good variety of vegetation. Blends in quite well with the surrounding residential area. My one complaint is there are very few benches, perhaps the neighborhood residents don't want people hanging out too much or homeless people sleeping here..
