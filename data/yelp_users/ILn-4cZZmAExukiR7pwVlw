I put this review together carefully to be fair to everyone. I have a negative peed I spit ion to filibertos in the past. I I live nearby and eat here often. I they are a 24 hour fast food restaurant. That said the food quality and service is well above average. I I do need to pass on a warning  the management believe everyone is out to rip them off.  keep your receipts. I went their one night right before the dining room closed. I  got carryou.when I returned home I found the broken tip to a hypodermic needle in my food. The next day I returned it with the tip of the syringe you could see blood still in it. I Ibrought this to the attention of the person in charge who called the manager she came back and inform me there is nothing they could do without a receipt which I didn't have. when I first walked in that day I wasn't looking for everything but just need to aware what happens what happened so they could print something like that happening again I I got the feeling that they simply worried more about having to refund my $10 and whether they had a problem with the quality control and food safety. I understand on very rare occasions something tenable can happen even in a good restaurant what is unacceptable is the idea of loosing one sale and the belief everyone is out to get you, would keepp the managent from trying to correct whatever led up to my meal
