Can't go wrong with the Lunch Special. Chicken Noodles and Thai fried rice are favorites.

They are on the Banned List. Sorry Tots, I wanted to like you. First time had the Sheczuan Chicken. It had sugar syrup sauce like orange chicken sauce with added chili flakes. Nasty and missing something. Fried rice was bland and old.   Second trip had the chicken lomein, again missing flavor and tasted old. Noticed 2 employees eating lunch and they had Pizza from another restaurant?  There are way better choices around that area, no need to go back.

Use to be my favorite but Going down hill. Cheap, but you get what you pay for. I have been paying a little more lately, and going elsewhere. Greasy and the cuts of meat are cheap. Not on the Band list yet, Ill give it one more shot.

Pho is great every time, service is fast and friendly, potstickers are the best I have ever had and they are only $3.50.  Plus %10 discount for Intel employees.

Had to down grade Bejing. The Pork fried rice used to be great, now it is old and tired. Seems like they make it the day before or something, Gray in color, not flavorful. The chicken is all thigh meat now and fatty. They are on the band list for now, so sorry Bejing.

They have a huge selection of Beer on Tap, evolving all the time. Awesome Burger!! Little spendy, but the burger was the best I have had in AZ. Free Range organic beef. Don't be in a hurry, this place is real chill.  Beer and Wine only, No hard stuff.
