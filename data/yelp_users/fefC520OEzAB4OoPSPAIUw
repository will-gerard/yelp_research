As an out of towner just trying to enjoy a holiday with my family, I found it quite entertaining that they chose to come here when we could have gone to a Buca di Beppo back home... but my family is not adventurous and knew that they were serving a "traditional holiday menu."  When we got here, they sat us immediately at a large table and I'm sure because of our reservations they already knew what to expect. A big, loud, Italian mixed family.   They started off with a huge bottle of wine, and then the food started pouring onto the table (benefits of advance notice of what we would be ordering). I still felt bad for our server though because we can be quite demanding, though he seemed to take it in stride.  The meal was delicious, we had a fine mixture of traditional holiday foods as well as a few of our Italian classics. My only real complaint was that I ate too much and felt very uncomfortable.  Why then you ask am I giving it only four stars? The food WAS delicious, and the service was impeccable, but you could still tell it was a national chain restaurant, and you could still tell that the servers didn't want to be there working on the holiday.  Would I come back? Maybe, but I will head to one closer to home.

By far my favorite restaurant we ate at in Scottsdale! Had this my first night in and every part of my dinner was glorious.  We ordered the Tokyo Tea for each person at the table and they are DEADLY but delicious.  Starters included several different sushi rolls, edamame, pot stickers, and sea weed salad. All were very good, but I didn't eat any edamame.   For dinner we decided to all order something different but share. It seemed simpler as it's hard to plan out meals when there are 6 people eating. We had three different curry dishes, as well as sushi platters. I have never been in a state of happiness quite like this.  The price was right, the food was amazing, though I might add that the service is very slow. Be prepared to sit at your table for upwards of an hour just for a meal.

I'm from out of town, but that doesn't mean that I don't know a good bar. I used to promote for bars and this is EXACTLY the kind of place that I would steer people away from.   The atmosphere is VERY pretentious, and it is what I would consider a middle class college bar. Every person around me that spoke to me, or that I spoke to made me feel like chances are there is no hope left for humanity.  The drinks were good as far as quantity and price are concerned. I'll put that in the plus category. If there was one thing here that stuck out to me the most it was the abhorrent music selection and the drunk people throwing up in the booths on the patio.   If ever I find myself in Phoenix I will not be back.
