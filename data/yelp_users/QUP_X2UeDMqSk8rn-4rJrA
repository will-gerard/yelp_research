Tired this place for the first time and got delivery.  Was told it would be here within 35-45 minutes.  After an hour I decided to call, was told the delivery boy should be here any minute, then got a call from the driver saying he was lost?!? WTF, you have my address and would hope you have a GPS or would know where to go!  Come to find out the girl who took the order, wrote my address down wrong after asking me it twice! Called back and the manager said, just don't worry about it we will take care of you next time, I got you.  Told him I would like hot food tonight not this cold pizza that I have, okay then I will cancel your order and hung up ? This place has awful customer service, mind you that was the owner!!!

Superior Detail did an amazing job on my 2010 BMW.  Travis is all about perfection and professionalism, his attention to detail is on point! Travis treats the car he is working on as if it were his own, leaving no room for errors! Highly recommend using them for your next detail or wash, your expectations will will be exceeded!
