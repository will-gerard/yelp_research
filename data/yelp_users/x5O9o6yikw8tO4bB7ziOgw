I have only eaten here physically at the location once. BUT I order catering for my office about once a week from this location. The couple that own the business are hard working nice folks, they always take my order via phone and are nice and responsive.  They are almost always a little (to a lot) early to deliver my sandwiches, but always include forks, places, lots of napkins, pickles and sauce. The coworkers that eat the sandwiches are always pleased with the product and I don't have anything but good things to say.

Biltmore Palms apartments converted to Biltmore Promenade is 2006. Many condos are still available to rent for a great price. If you buy one, it's a great bargain.  What does this 100ish unit condo complex offer? 2bed 2bath and 1bed 1bath condos  Small fitness center Hot tub Pool Sun bathing with misters Small club house Putting green Grills throughout complex Covered parking Mountain views  Why do I like Biltmore Promenade? Close to downtown PHX Close to old town Super close to Biltmore  2 miles from Postinos and Vig Arcadia  Feet from Phoenix award winning dive bar, Shadys.  A nice quiet complex close to the action.

Friendly and helpful staff - that's something lacking if you are used to using an ATM for all your banking needs. This is a great traditional service approach. I personally used their mortgage services and was extremely impressed. This location is also great for your personal needs, it's right off of 24th Street and Camelback, so for me, it's convenient.   I would highly recommend Washington Federal to friends.

I very rarely eat fast food, but I was craving some crunchy chicken goodness, with a biscuit and slaw. The only think awesome about the place? SPORKS (why haven't they ever become mainstream, the world may never know)! They were OUT of biscuits and dropped my change onto the pavement without offering to make it right. They may be right down the street from me... but I will be sure to stick to local mom and pop shops going forward.

Stopped by to get a sub before my class at JoAnns. No sense of urgency whatsoever. Receipt didn't have an item breakdown for my meal. So why my tiny sandwich was 8.09, I won't know. Will not be back.

Bought two "groupons" for the driving range - was just notified that this location is now closed and that I could be given a refund. I have been to this driving range in the past and was impressed, but for it closing down after buying a package - that's a one star in my book. RIP Fiddlesticks, until the next chapter 11...

Met up with my mom for lunch at Crazy Jim's yesterday. Because of my amazingly stealth parallel parking skills and a handful of change, I was able to get a meter right up in front. We were seated right away, and were able to start catching up without issue. The menu options looked great, I went for the burger. Served just as ordered it had that homemade grill taste and I was very pleased. Service was great for a busy lunch time frame. I would go back again, loved that they had a counter for singles.

FIVE STAR DIVE BAR! I love this place. The regulars are friendly, the staff is great and I love that there is a good menu to help keep your tummy full. The drinks are CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP and poured to be powerful. A handful of pool tables and plenty of TVs to catch up on sports. and A+ dive bar. I have driven past it for years (it's just south of the Phoenix Baptist Hospital) and FINALLY stopped in.... now I am starting to become a regular, especially since it doesn't hurt your pocket book at all!

Hidden Gem alert!  Support local. This great restaurant has cheap margaritas, good food and great service. I have been eating more often there because I am trying to support local business dealing with the light rail construction.   Make sure to utilize the Valley Metro "Metro Max" card that they are giving out during the light rail extension  - you'll get a discount!  PS: The bean dip for the chips and salsa is AMAZING!

I adore Glen Lakes. I have been just playing golf for a little over a year and love meeting up with my father here for a fun nine holes. The price for nine holes is a bargain! (Winter or Summer - it's always a steal) Dave the golf pro is fantastic, I took several private lessons with him and he has helped me improve greatly. He also organizes a monthly scrabble, which is always fun to participate in. Overall, this is my go to executive course for price and fun. This place really is a gem.

I have to fess up to something... I have been here several times and have only ordered on entree on the menu. I know I need to branch out, but when you have had a tough day and all you crave is good solid comfort food, why switch it up (there is always next time!) The only negative is the tight parking where I always end up in a dark alley.  So the one menu item that has me all worked up? The Roasted "Free Range" Chicken. It is AMAZING... A-MAZ-ING. It is good for my soul. It comes with what the menu states is "creamy" polenta, which is serious like the best mash ever. Along with the veggies and an entire half of a chicken that is seasoned to perfection, you can't go wrong. I always leave stuffed and satisfied.  I guess I will have to branch out and try other menu items and report back to my yelping friends of course.

My go to Dive Bar by Biltmore. I avoid weekends because the smoke from the front porch billows into the bar but on a nice weeknight you can have a spot in a booth to catch up with a good friend, listen to eclectic music via the juke box and catch a random 1980s movie on the small screen over your friends shoulder. The drinks are always solid and I love the fact that they open early on weekends so you can go get a mimosa and utilize their free wifi - though I wish they offered a few food options, especially since many use Shady's as their last stop on the weekends. PS: I love that it has the "mad men" appeal of a dark bar (as if you are meeting someone and you don't want anyone to know) and a total plus? the ladies restroom is always clean.

I will absolutely return - I had been meaning to check out St. Francis for a while now. The server was very helpful in navigating and suggesting items on the menu and the wine list. The goat cheese appetizer was lovely... main meal was delightful and the local dessert was heaven. The noise in the busy restaurant wasn't too loud, so I was able to carry on a conversation with my date. Just like I mentioned in my opening - I will absolutely return, what a great find on Camelback!

I've stopped in twice during normal hours and was told they were currently not serving?!?! If third try is a charm, we may never know.

The atmosphere and artwork - amazing. Baristas - great, but they like to get to know you after a few visits and then they become friendlier. Spicy Chai Latte Hot - a little bit of heaven.  Ill be honest, I discovered "my drink" on my first visit (I stop by at least once a week since it's near work) Hot Spicy Chai Latte with Skim milk. The "spicy" gives the drink an extra kick that you just don't get with a normal chai latte. So I never have every ordered anything else.   My huge pet peeve? They don't always open at 8am like they state on their door. Not just by a few minutes, but sometimes not even within the first hour... I want to support this great local hangout and it's hard to if they don't open their doors. NOTE - 8am! Yes, they sell coffee, but I guess they need to sleep in first. :rollseyes:  Also it's a great place to meet a client in a late morning etc. There are some seats outside for when it's a beautiful AZ day.

This has become a standard meet up location for me after a long day at work. I love the atmosphere and the music is always spot on. Weekday evenings it has just the right mood - not over crowded ever - so you are able to carry on a conversation without issue. Parking can be a slight issue competing with Pei Wei and Starbucks but  you forget all that when you walk up those SideBar stairs. Great place to catch up and relax after a long day at work.

I was referred to Doctor Bobbie Bennett a over a year ago and was impressed from my first visit on.  Dr. Bobbie takes the time to check in with you on each visit making sure that the personalized treatments are working for you. She also takes the time needed with each patient. For example, last week I had a simple question about my posture and she showed me stretches I can use to improve it (I guess I sit in front of a computer too much!) I was impressed that she took the time to physically show me the different stretches/exercises and explain to me why my shoulders were rolling in. My last chiropractor would just do the same few adjustments and move on to the next patient. This is not the case with Dr. Bobbie - she shows how much she cares with every visit.  I feel so lucky to have Dr. Bobbie as my Chiropractor and have recommended her to several friends that are still also seeing her.  As the other reviewer stated, the office is lovely - if you leave a message, they respond immediately when they get to the office. They make it fast and easy to "squeeze" in a visit if needed and the office hours are very balanced so that you are easily able to make an appointment and get in. She also runs on time with her appointments - so it's nice when I run over on an office break to get adjusted that I know what to expect.   I will continue to see Dr. Bobbie Bennett - I realize how much my life balance has improved from getting adjusted by this outstanding, professional chiropractor.

What a great hole in the wall mom and pop shop. I have a friend that lives close by and I happen to work up the street so we meet often for their happy hour. Their happy hour specials are some of the best in town (5pm-9pm Monday-Saturday) They offer fun combo specials and during happy hour its buy a sake, the beer is free or vice versa - at any rate, the prices are spot on.   The entire staff is part of the neighborhood and they take the time to get to know your name (if you want that bonding to happen) Yes, it's a hole in the wall, but it's clean, comfortable and you can't beat the price.

I love the fact that it's kitty corner from a Starbucks and still holds it's own.  I'll be honest, I have never taken an offered cooking class, bought that many items at the marketplace or hung out for the atmosphere...  ...but I do partake in the coffee bar and love it. I always avoid the temptation of their amazingly wonderful looking morning eats and sweets, and I don't know how I continue to resist.   I get my Chai Tea Latte or my sugar with coffee and cream (just like Mike D.) and head into work. I love the vintage fun feel you get and the neighborhood environment is nifty.   I guess I need to expand and try one of their cooking classes or at least hang out and give the atmosphere a chance to sink in.  Though it doesn't have the drive through like the Starbucks I mentioned earlier, it does have a pretty fast moving coffee bar set up and barista. Even if I am running tight for work, I still take the time to park, get off my tush and walk into Luci's because it really does help brighten my day... and walking off with their cute blue and orange to go cup reminds you to smile as you walk into the office.

I love that the Arizona Humane Society has an offsite location here. They have two main shelter locations and then Petique. Petique has great gifts to give for pet lovers and amazing animals up for adoption. Normally a few dogs, cats and sometimes a rabbit or smaller critter available.   The bonus is that Biltmore is a pet friendly mall, so you will see the adoptable dogs taking their walks around the mall.   If you adopt from there, you get a 10% off any purchases going forward. It is tax free and helps other animals in need. A nice selection of collars and gifts. I do wish they offered more cat items though.   Stick to PetSmart like retailer thought for your pet food, this is more of a boutique for gifts etc.  Friendly staff and volunteers make this store a wonderful experience. Be sure to check it out!

Gotta love this place.  Treasures to be found.  Though I wish they had less pyrex and more fireking - I love all the finds to be had. While shopping in these two small old houses you start your mission to find something fun, unique and special. I have quite a few fun vintage necklaces from Cheap Thrills (in addition to shoes, outfits and some random fun finds)  They have a fun punch card and after ten items you get 10% off your next purchase (this might be for just the Cheap Thrills house to the East, since the newer West house version is mostly furniture)  I love checking in every couple weeks to see what is "new" at Cheap Thrills!

I have been driving Volkswagens for over sixteen years now, so I knew I wanted to get another VW. I have been servicing at another Valley dealership and knew I would not enjoy the experience purchasing a vehicle from them. So I drove from downtown Phoenix, where I reside, to Peoria. I am pleased I went the "extra mile" to Lunde's Peoria VW.  Daniel was a big help in making sure I was able to trade in my 2001 New Beetle for a 2014 Beetle. He was helpful and made sure to answer all my questions through out the process. I was very pleased with the no pressure experience. He worked within my budget and no haggling was needed at any point. I would absolutely recommend Peoria Volkswagen above all other dealerships in the valley. I love my "newer" Beetle and had a great purchase experience (and who ever says that about buying a car?!?!)

Interesting that they allow someone associated with a competitor write a review, with one star, and not filter it (when she clearly hasn't been here as a customer and claims that all these reviews are professional written.) Now don't get me wrong. I miss my old chiropractor in Tempe, but I live and work in Midtown and Biltmore. So The Joint helps with convenience of location, hours and allowing for walkins. I have never felt like they were as attention detailed as my past Chiro - BUT my past Chiro would be charging me 65 + a visit for a non insurance visit. This is $19 your first time and $30 each one after. In addition, they offer multiple visit cards. Again, they are available for walkins six days a week. Overall I am pleased with the service I have gotten here.

Extremely impressed - The valet is located on the west side of the Westin and they make sure to let you know that you can be validated for up to 3 hours. The host was polite and our server, just lovely. She was so helpful with the menu - offering suggestions, answering questions etc. The food? AMAZING! The server could tell how much fun we were having with the different flavors of our salmon and skirt steak. She let us know about the upcoming summer menu and then asked us if we would like to speak to the chef. Chef Rita came out to speak with us and chatted about what we enjoyed, the upcoming summer menu etc. It was a memorable evening and I am looking forward to my second visit this upcoming week.

Second visit with summer menu - just as great as our first experience. I look forward to taking clients here and meeting friends at the bar after work etc.  Province will continue to be a suggestion for my Central Phoenix friends looking to try something refreshing and new.

Vicky has been a real blessing for my skin. I originally went to her last winter for a Mani Pedi combo my girlfriends gave me for my birthday. I ended up getting the "Peel Deal" and my skin loves me for it. I can't tell you how much better I look thanks to her quick 30 minute sessions. She is always friendly, kind and very upbeat. You can't beat her pricing or her customer service.

I have to order lunch for work meetings quite a bit, I'm always looking for good food that is a crowd pleaser. I tend to order online (easy!) and pick up the next day. The customer service has always been upbeat and they have been great about my requests (oil/vinegar on the side, that way the subs don't get soggy on the drive back to the office) - they even got me signed up for their loyalty card and I've earned a free sub.  Also, they are great about wrapping the veggie sub separate from the meat subs. This puts me at ease presenting the food to guests and coworkers. Also, the subs come labeled in a cute box. So be sure to consider the box of subs for your next office meeting or party of ten.

I have to laugh at the person that stated the service was bad. I have now been three times (can you blame a gal for craving a burger?) and each time everyone is almost too overfriendly. They ask if you have been in before and if you state no, they offer to go over the menu. Now this might stop after this location has been open longer, but it's helpful since there are only a few locations in the valley. When your order is ready, you are paged and you go up to grab your meal, and they always find it necessary to read back your order, when right in your hand is a tray with a juicy burger begging you to take a bite... so I am always a little feisty for them to read it off, since I want to chow down! They also seem to want to check in on you while you are eating, which is nice... but can be overwhelming if you are on your lunch break and trying to catch up with a friend... but I won't complain about good ol' polite customer service.   I order their original char burger without cheese and without the onions (I did try them with the onions and honestly, I liked the taste of the burger better without)  I like their crispy onion rings, they seem healthy if that is even possible for an onion ring... but they are crispy and not greasy. Try them, you'll understand what I am saying better :)  The fun item I always get "to go"??? Their coffee flavored milk shake. It's light, it has nice flavor and is a little bit of heaven.  PS: Parking is not like it was with "My Florist" there are many more available spaces now, which is totally awesome.

Very friendly, polite service. I tend to get my meal to go, its quick and easy. I tend to get the Pad Thai and ask for it with vegetables instead of chicken or shrimp.   Be sure to show your Valley Metro "Metro Max" card, it's 10% off your meal. Plus you're supporting local business during the 19th Avenue Northwest light rail expansion!
