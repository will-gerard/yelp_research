YESSSSSS! Oh my gosh this is good food. My husband brought me here first, then recently my sister-in-law got mini-sandwiches for my wedding craft party that she hosted, and I ate three of them because they were just so good! I've gotta get back there soon!

Two stars for the sandwiches, negative three stars for them never answering their phone.

Order the huge cookie thing that has melted chocolate and ice cream in it. AMAZING! I think it used to be called Pazookie but they don't advertise it now apparently.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley, seriously! The atmosphere is great, first off. So much personality in the colors, paintings, plants, and other unique Mexican decorating accents. I knew it was a cool place the first time I went there as soon as I saw the Frida Kahlo painting on the wall that you see when you first walk in. There is always someone  smiling to greet you and take you to your seat, which I've never had to wait for.   It is quite a large place, and each room is decorated differently - one room even has a mural-type painting on the walls of a scene in a charming-looking Latin American town. The waitresses wear dresses that reflect their culture.   I noticed instantly that most of the customers were of Hispanic descent (a really good sign!) and that the staff had thick accents. I felt like maybe I wasn't in the States anymore!   Oh yea, and the food is SSSSOOOOO good. I like it that their menu has a photo of every single meal they serve. That rocks! And, they have levels of spiciness for the hotter dishes on the menu -- five chili peppers next to the description means you better be able to handle the heat they serve!!

Sooo tasty! Dim lights, semi-formal. There's a bar on the left and the dining is to the right. Tables/booths are placed far enough away that you can get a nice intimate dining experience. I love the macadamia nut chicken dish. Wow!!! The service is excellent also. The parking lot is weird and it's in a strip mall, but it's a diamond in the rough :)

This place is great when you're looking for dives. I don't totally agree that it is the 'Cheer's' of Phoenix, but for the regulars they all know each other. I found that it's more of a place to go when you don't want to run into anyone you know. Smaller setting and hard to find if you're just driving by. I bought a cute tank-top there that says "Swizzle Inn, Swagger Out." It's hilarious, I love it!

ERIN JOHNSON is the bomb! She is so friendly and gave me exactly what I wanted for my cut/color. You also get a hand wax while you wait. The decor is amazing!!! Wow. The whole experience is great, I highly recommend it. Reasonable prices too.

Friendly, very knowledgeable, and quick service. You are greeted by a smiling face when you walk in the door, and it won't be longer than 10 seconds before a rep comes to see if you need guidance. I love it that you can make a purchase without standing in line or going up to the register! They have little traveling register keypad thingys. I stood in the middle of the store in the software aisle while paying for my iMac, very cool! Oh, and he carried it out to my car without me asking for help. :)

Every time I go to this place, my taste buds thank me. I have tried many different meals, and each one has its own great flavor. I have also tried some of their desserts and drinks, totally tasty. People are super friendly there and it has a nice clean fresh atmosphere. Even my meat-eating husband complimented the faux-meat dish he got. I wish they got more business though, the parking lot is almost always empty when I go. The hours are a bit weird but I can understand it if they don't get customers all day long. If I could afford to eat out every day, I'd go to this place for sure. There are so many things still on the menu that I want to try.

The hours say that this store opens at 7:30. It is now 8 o'clock and still the gates are all locked up and lights are off. I called their phone number and I got an answering machine. They should change their posted hours or make sure they have employees that come in on time.

Really tasty, and a good variety on the menu. Food is served quickly and the place is always very clean. Love the crab cakes and spring rolls! I agree with the previous review about the parking lot, but you can't blame that on the restaurant really.

This is my new favorite lunch place. It is right by my new house and I am stoked to have a local go-to spot. The hot veggie sandwich is excellent and the dressing has such a savory flavor. The garlic breadsticks are some of the best I've had. Haven't had pizza yet but plan to soon.

Pies. Amazing. Been here about three or four times and I always have to get a slice of pie every time. They are SOOOOOOOO yummy.   Great people watching and interacting because it's a stopping point for travelers going to many different places. Live music most of the time. Lots of fun :)

Wow, this place is still here? I went there as a girl (15+ years ago) with the family on a regular basis. If it's still around, then it MUST be good!

I actually had the opposite experience as Brad H (see his review on 7/10/08). I want to compliment two of the cashiers/regular workers and one of the managers.   I wanted to buy a cat tower but I noticed that one of them had fur on it already! And you know how territorial cats are, my cat probably wouldn't want anything to do with it if it had already been scented. So I asked a nice young gal about how they sold them and if we are supposed to carry off what's displayed or if they are in the back somewhere in boxes. She said whatever is out on the floor is all they have usually unless they have a couple extras in the very top shelves. She offered to call her manager for me and I accepted.   The manager came immediately and was helpful and friendly. She offered to give me a discount on the one that had fur on it and she also went to see if there were extras in those top-shelf areas. There were, but I felt bad (and didn't have much time) making her get someone with a forklift to get it down and go through all that trouble. Anyway, I ended up getting a different one that had no trace of "being tested out" -- which isn't actually allowed, so someone must have snuck their animal onto that other one or something. She helped me carry mine to the register.   Then to top it off, the cashier helped me not only carry it out to my car, but spent like 5 minutes out there in the AZ heat with me as we figured out how to fit the darn thing in my car! She was friendly and happy to help the whole time.   Overall I am really satisfied with my time spent there and even though all Petsmarts have pretty expensive items, their people make it worth the experience.

I haven't stayed here but have been a repeat pool-hopper during those hot AZ summers. I haven't been there for a while, so I am not sure if it's still fairly easy to sneak in. It's gorgeous, so I can only imagine the rooms are very nice and the food must be awesome. A stay at this place is definitely on our to-do list.

Go every year, always a blast! Great people-watching, too. And you learn to beat the system when it comes to getting free tastes of beer. ;)  Also, I liked it that they were WELL-equipped with port-o-johns. There wasn't as much waiting this year as there was last year. They also have hand sanitizers inside the johns.

The best 'cool' place in Snottsdale!!! Kind of a dive bar but still totally popular. I just miss the ping-pong table. They must have ditched that for more table and bar space, which I guess is understandable but still. Anyway I love going there whenever. AND... it's one of the few Scottsdale places that serves (consistently) generous mixed drinks, if you know what I mean!!!!! And it never fails that I bump into great friends!

Just went last night...Great! We sat at the sushi bar where you can watch the guys slicin' n' dicin'. I ordered the Udon noodles and chicken. SO good. Just the right amount of spice, but not too hot that it takes away from the flavor. Everyone was very nice and helpful... we got the lady up front to help us get a cab.

I also have a complaint of Barlow but for different reasons. They delivered the gas range I bought from home depot and left it in its box in the dining room because my new kitchen floors and cabinets were not ready yet. They said to just call them back when I was ready to have someone install it. Floors and cabinets are now done so I slid the box into the kitchen to sort of get it ready for them and I called and asked to schedule the appointment for someone to come out. She asked me if it was moved from its original location and I said yea, it's five feet away from the dining room, now in the kitchen. She refused to send someone to install it because of 'liability' -- it had to stay in the initial spot or they wouldn't come do it. Bull Crap. Now I have to find someone and PAY them to do it, since I have no clue what I am doing and the instructions say that a qualified person needs to install gas ranges.   So, if you ever have to buy appliances from Home Depot, you get to be unfortunate enough to deal with Barlow Company Inc. Be sure if you do move an appliance like I did, not to tell them on the phone. Then move it back by the time the guy gets out there.

Delicious food! Sweet potato fries are to die for, wish I could make them myself just like theirs. They come in a little mini-grocery cart, so cute! I remember we had these seasonal beer samplers - I think you get like five samples of beer or something; they tell you all about each one. Very cool. I like sitting outside so you can people-watch. Gelato Spot is a must afterward (100 feet away or so).    My only complaint would be the size of the place. You are in close quarters with everyone and can't really get the intimate feel if you're on a date.

The food is great, the prices are up there. It's always freezing cold in the restaurant so if you're not doing takeout bring your sweater. Definitely get the side of Mac and Cheese, you won't be disappointed!!

Great place! I love selling there, I get credit or cash back and it's not too shabby.   A couple of things I don't like about it:  --they host meetings in that little room in the back that tend to get VERY loud. I realize it's a bookSTORE and not a library, but I am seriously deterred from continuing my book browsing when a bunch of noisy people are talking with their playground voices and not their inside-voices. (Yes, I am a teacher) --it would be cool if there was some sort of database so that a person could call or do an online search to see if Bookman's has a certain book. I realize this is a daunting task, but they could gradually start it by doing one extra step of entering book titles / authors every time they purchase a book from sellers. It could even be a shared online database that each has access to at their stations. Or they could write it down on a sheet that employees would later enter into a spreadsheet or database.

NO. Don't go. I thought it was a great concept but their implementation of the Mexican/Asian idea was far from meeting any kind of expectations. I wanted to be able to come in and look at a menu and order easily and quickly. Instead, the girl said not to look at their menu up on the wall because it wasn't the real one. HUH???? Instead we should look at this laminated picture thingy she held out to us that explained the various plates and sides, etc. and told us we needed to sample each little dish before deciding. I had no time to do any such silly thing!   I lost my patience so I just ordered a quesadilla and then sat down to wait for Eric to finish his order. He ordered some weird combo dish for himself that actually wasn't too bad. The place itself was a little strange. It was almost as though they had very first opened their doors hastily without finishing the details... the "fake" misleading menu, for one; and the lack of decor, for two. A few objects here and there suggested it was a mix of Hispanic and Asian, but it just felt empty and had no character or enthusiasm. Especially in the folks taking orders.

My husband and I went here for Valentine's Day dinner. We had fun, but a lot of the fun had to do with the people dining and serving there. The food was good, no complaints. We had two huge beers that we both couldn't finish. The music sets the tone - unique folky [German] music I am guessing. The decor is rather thrown-together and pretty random; there is definitely plenty to look at. I think they have patio seating too, so I'd recommend that because you can people watch on Glendale which is great!

Weird location and hard to see just driving by, but really cool place. Small and cozy. I especially like the listening stations. I have been introduced to a few artists now just from hearing them for the first time on Stinkweeds' headphones. :)   Get a piercing while you're there--at the store next door! haha

I LOVE this place. It's where I met my husband, lol. It is like the Cheers of Phoenix. Everyone does know your name, if you've gone there a few times. Always a smiling person greeting you. Not many stuffy people; everyone gets along (or they toss your rude butt out) and you can always find a pool or shuffleboard partner. Trivia is fun, too. They are always coming up with fun events based on sports or other games they involve the crowd with. This is a place you'll want to repeatedly return to. When you go, look for me! See you there!! :)

They are under construction so it's a little confusing, especially when the cookies are on the same aisle as the toilet paper (but as my husband commented, maybe the cookies are REALLY good).   Anyway I wanted to give this place thumbs up because everyone was so nice! And it wasn't that fake nice, they were actually happy upbeat people.

My review is mostly for Julia, my waxer. She helped to make my first and subsequent experiences there more comfortable. There is a little private waiting room within the salon/spa and there is nice music and a small fountain. The girls bring you water while you wait. Maybe tea/coffee too, but I'm not sure.   I want to go back to get my hair done and possibly get a mani/pedi. Any girls with me on that one?   I purchased some hair products there too -- I recommend the Bumble & Bumble line.

You really have to dig to find stuff, and sometimes even then you can't get what you're looking for. They have SO MUCH. And they recently expanded their store - only 2/3 of the building was used for selling fabric and the back third was for storing their shipments, etc. but now they knocked down part of that back area and are in the process of putting even more fabric in there. Much of it includes huge bolts of felt. And not just the 'normal' colors - they've got a pretty good selection there.   The trim selection is great. You'll notice that you can spend a fortune on home decor when you shop at JoAnn and other such places. But here you save a great deal.   The only reason SAS loses a star from me is because the ladies here are not always friendly and you have to wait a long time sometimes to get your stuff cut.   At the Indian School location, that set of ladies are fun and friendly.

OMG they have the best Dolmades I have ever had. I've searched high and low for them, including multiple Greek restaurants and the Greekfest. Still no one can beat PJ's dolmades. I am also in love with the roasted bell pepper hummus.   I went there for take-out yesterday. The dolmades were almost finished by the time I got home. I skipped the pitas that came with the hummus and instead brought out my own veggies, all of which went great with the dip. I want the recipe!!   The restaurant itself is such a pleasant place to be, too. The inside is huge with high ceilings and lots of windows, and the patio is always hoppin'. This was the second time I went and I have yet to eat a mediocre item there.

Emerge is a beautiful and peaceful place. I took a yoga class here with Paige, who is an excellent teacher. The studio is welcoming and has a soothing feeling. I hope to come back again. I recommend it to anyone!

There isn't a sign out front at all but they must not need it because it's pretty busy. We only know about it because my husband found it looking up restaurants online.   There are no places whatsoever to sit and wait after you first get there and put in your name.   There is no parking other than valet (or you can risk it with the business parking lot next door, or do some walking and park in front of the neighborhood houses).   There is a really awesome appetizer that I forget what it is called - little tiny green peppers in oil and salt. Wow, so yummy and unique. I had a great Mixed Grain Salad that was bursting with flavor even though it was packed with good nutrients! I remember there being some sort of hash browns covered in melted cheese that my husband had.   Other than there not being any waiting area, there were also hazards. More than one person tripped in the same tree planter (the one shown in the picture that has the tree trunk in front of a table) and one woman even fell down into the gravel on her knees in a dress. Staff was ready with a broom right after to push the gravel back into the planter, so you know it must happen all the time. It's a cramped spot; not planned well by the designers. What IS cool, as far as design goes, is the hallway with the cassette-tape wall and their fancy-slash-industrial bathrooms.   My husband and I had a long wait to get a table, but the hosts and waiters were very apologetic and nice, and they even comped us our appetizer because of it!

Really hip hangout. I went at night though, and I imagine it would make a nice daytime chill place during summer. I met up with a friend who had a cabana rented, which was cool but it's ideal for a small group; pretty cool that there's a tv in there! Our mexican food appetizers were tasty. The gals working are cute and friendly.

I love having this place so close to my house. My husband and I walked there yesterday and I picked up a jump rope and a 10lb medicine ball for 35 bucks total. I am going back again today (with the truck) to get a bench, a stepper platform thingy and a chest press bar. Wish I had a whole room in the house for just gym stuff. Going to have to get creative with where I will put these things.   This place seems to have everything for almost every sport. It even has a skateboard-ski thing which is like a board on the top but instead of wheels it has four mini-skis. Good selection of cleats, wrestling shoes (didn't know there was such a thing), and other sports shoe types. Has steppers, treadmills, ellipticals, gym exercise machines, dumbbells, and tons more. Awesome!
