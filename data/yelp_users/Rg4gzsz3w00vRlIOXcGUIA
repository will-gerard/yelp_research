Always love Primanti's and I was Central Pittsburgh area, so I went for lunch. It was after the rush and wasn't too busy but the waitresses acted like it was. I was told to sit myself, which is cool since I wanted to sit outside. But then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me. Finally a third came and took my order. I got my usual.... pastrami, extra cheese, no tomato, add egg. When did she miss the "no tomato"? I got my sammich (eventually) and there was the tomato. I immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again MIA. She just disappeared again. I waited as long as I could but she never came back. I finally carried the sloppy tomato seed-covered bread back into the restaurant myself and told the cook I needed a new piece of bread. He gave it to me with a funny look, then I ate my sammich, and then five minutes later the waitress finally showed up. Until then she was just missing. I was so annoyed, but when she came back it was just to refill my drink. A few minutes later I needed my bill, but guess what, she was gone again! I had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it. I was really annoyed. Love me some Primantis but the Market Square one has terrible service.

I was walking by here today and some saw friends eating out front. They welcomed me over to share lunch with them. I'd been planning on another place but as soon as I saw the pastrami I was hooked. I got in a short line (although about 20 people got in line right after me) and checked the menu. The way they were throwing the sandwiches together reminded me of Primanti's in Pittsburgh. They had a no nonsense-we know what we're doing-kinda attitude. There was no frufru on the menu, just great meat with a few "specials". I got the skyscraper which was a great, fresh bun piled with corned beef and pastrami. Then a slice of swiss and some deli mustard. Perfect! I grabbed a side of sauerkraut and a drink. We sat out front and I can just simple say that everything was just perfect. Cheap and tasty, and without a waitstaff, there was no tipping needed!

We love the Zoo. It's in Papago Park, which is one of the coolest areas around Phoenix. If you'r planning to go more than once in a year, it's worth it to get the membership. The zoo has the basics like flamingos, bears, zebras, giraffes, orangutans, rhinos, tigers, etc.... you can feed the giraffes, ride a camel, and walk under the monkeys in a special enclosure.

I've been going here for years. See in 1999 I went to the UK on my first trip across the pond, came back missed it, and was invited to G&D. This place reminded me of what it was like in England and I loved it. The first couple of years my problem with going was the smoke but after Phoenix (& AZ) went smokefree the restaurant cleaned up quickly.   The left side is all pool tables and darts. My best friend and I spent many nights with a beer and a game of darts here. The right side is a restaurant section where you can sit down to have a great dinner. This section is large enough to easily accommodate a group dinner as we did often.  The beers here are great and the variety is exceptional. For the food, I always get the same exact thing. Shepherd Pie is my favorite, and I have seriously never had better (even in the UK). It's perfect with cheese & HP sauce. You just can't get any better than George & Dragon on Central.

We have a group that meets monthly and have been to George & Dragon II one other time so we felt safe going back, but this time was like day and night. We got there early because we planned on having a dozen or so people there on a Friday evening, and there was a larger party in the back room. The other half of the room was empty so we asked to sit there. The waitress agreed so we took a seat. We asked for drinks which took a few minutes. Two friends came after we got our initial round, and they were ignored. The waitress seemed to be more interested in the larger group with the bigger tip.   Part of our meeting dealt with being online since we're a technology education group, and we were blown off. Finally we were told that they no longer have wireless (which they use to "share" with the hotel next door). This was really annoying, but we weren't offered any excuses or apologies. We put away our laptops and prepared to enjoy an evening of drinks and dinner.   After an hour of literally not getting served (drinks or food), we waited for a table to open in the front. A few of our people were annoyed and left without ordering anything and another person was told not to bother coming. We finally got a booth out front and complained to the waitress there. She said the next round was on the manager, who she supposedly told about our unhappiness (but unsurprisingly, he never came over at all to talk to us). We got our free drinks and two of us who were famished were able to eat.   As soon as we were done eating, we got out of there and parted from the bust of an evening. We quickly removed George and Dragon II from our rotation of places for this meeting.   From the fact this is has become a dive bar (absolutely NOTHING like the AWESOME George and Dragon I on Central), that the wait staff mostly sucks, and that they don't seem to care about customers, we are completely done with this place. DO NOT GO HERE.

A group of men went over here to get some beer and wings last night, and a few customers gave them a bad look because obviously there were two gay couples. They ordered some food and drinks, but the bartender immediately started being rude to them when asking for their IDs. They did nothing but want some food and drinks. One of them was asked to leave immediately, and the group asked why they needed to leave. The bartender just kept getting ruder and ruder. Eventually the group got up to leave without eating, as the bartender told them they weren't wanted... he said that Native New Yorker is a "straight bar" and they weren't wanted there ever.

I love this place. It's great Pakistani food near my house. The chicken boti is really good and the naan is acceptable. Last night a few of my party said things were too spicy so if that's not your bag, have them knock down the spice a little for you.   The service was great. We had a group of 6 and the man was accommodating and friendly. We had drinks all evening and he brought us food when it was ready. It was quick and tasty.   If memory serves, they do not have alcohol but you may bring your own wine to share at your table (we've done that several times here).

When the wife and I want wings, we go here. I don't typically worry about the Tuesday night special. I just go when we want them, and 99% of the time we do carryout. It's near the house, I get Honey Hot. She gets Parmesan, and we've never had a bad experience. If you like veggies, order extra (and be willing to pay) because they are skimpy on them. And yes service can be an issue here and I don't see the same people very often.

Went tonight for a takeout order so we could watch Monday Night Football. Order and paid for extra celery & blue cheese( price went up to $1 each! )... Got the order and took it home. The wife wanted to know where the blue cheese was. There was four celery and ONE blue cheese! I was pissed and called them. I drove 3 miles back, and Chelsey who took the order and answered when I called back, told me I was wrong and she personally put three blue cheese in the bag.   Do not ever tell a customer he is a liar. This is what she did. I am about ready to call the manager. My friends do not go here anymore but I've always defended this restaurant. Tonight makes me want to change my mind.

Went there to photograph a concert. Great crowd and fun quirky locals. Loved the dive bar ambience without being trashy/dirty. The lighting for the show wasn't great but the sound was good. Great beers, too. Get the 99Shillings.

We've been taking our daughter to SwimKids USA since June 2006 for both swimming and gymnastics. I can't praise this company or its employees enough. Everyone has always been wonderful there.   For swimming, the first priority is water safety and survival. This last three levels before they begin to learn various strokes, how to swim correctly, and then onto the competitive levels. My daughter has regularly swam with several women there and we've never had a bad instructor. Maribel is a great instructor, and she currently really likes Elena. Amanda is good and so are others. (Depends on your kids personality). I've seen my daughter learn by leaps and bounds and she loves the water and swimming because of this company.  In Gymnastics, Allison runs the show. She's the head of gymnastics, and she's the perfect instructor for the children in there. The gym classes don't get too large and there's almost always two instructors. They learn the basic gymnastics that will later develop into the more traditional gymnastics that you see on tv.   All classes are 30 minutes and you get a discount for the second class. They also have dance but we've not done that yet. There's a smaller play pool where you can take your kid when you're not in lessons and the hours for the place are great, but I just wish they were open on Sundays.  The business is family owner and always have been. Lana Whitehead is the owner and still teaches in the pool after all these years. They have events at SwimKidsUSA like Blake's Miracle and also special Olympics viewings with past Olympiads.  Take your kids to SwimKidsUSA, and it's like family. (And no I do not work there or get any money for this, I just really like taking my daughter there!)

This is a gem. They recently opened other sites, but this one is the best. Nestled on a small road behind Home Depot, it's a wonderful suburban breakfast nook.   My favorite meal here is the pork carnitas, and I barely have to wait for a table (don't got at 1030 on a Sunday though, if you don't want to work).  We don't go every weekend anymore, but the wait staff always remembers us and greets us with a smile. We've barely ever had a bad experience here. If you want a southeast breakfast place along the 60, go here!

Came here with a huge group recently. We had 65+ people on the patio and the wait staff handled it like champs. I bought some tasty burrito that's supposed to be the best seller there and enjoyed my beer, but I wish you had craft beer. The patio is very nice & everyone was older so it was pretty chill there.

I forgive their crowdedness always because it's so good.   Last night my child's school had a fundraiser there (read: damn good excuse to go back) and since it's less than a mile from her school, we rocked it after I picked her up. Pizza muffins are always the thing ordered no matter the group, and I love that they have at least one local San Tan Brewery beer on tap mostly always, and it was only $2 a pint!   When I go, I always get the Calzone. The two item calzone is how I roll and I am a traditional ricotta kinda guy; they sure do load it up, so I always order that. If we have 2+ people we like to also get the antipasto salad, which is always made fresh and tasty with ingredients that seem to be picked daily.   Tonight my daughter had the ravioli from the full children's menu and her mother said it was quite tasty, too. Unless you have a large party for the party room, there's usually a well worth it wait, but last night we noticed they're remodeling so I bet they're adding more seating through a previously sealed off area. Go team!

I grew up around my hometown coffee house where I practically lived, so I was pretty stoked to find this place 2 miles from my house in AZ. I've stopped by here and there over the years, but now I come more often. I'd love to be here all of the time but alas I can't.  I teach and write online and many of the times, the wifi here is so slow. I've talked to the owner and he explains that PCs with viruses pound their routers with packets and it slows everything down. He said everyone should buy MACs. This sounded odd to me, but, in his defense, every time I convince the barsita to reboot the router, it's faster for a little bit. Still not as fast as other places with similar number of customers. This is why it doesn't get 5 stars from me.  I love their drinks. I get a 32oz (no idea why Joe A. said their ice teas come in only 16oz) black passion fruit tea. Totally yummy. I always buy a refill up front for when I leave. If I need a kick, I grab a large hot black and white frost, too. No idea what's in it, but it gets me flying until they close at midnight.  Ah yes, they're open until midnight, and NO where (coffeehouse) else around here is open that late. They're also on a lake where ducks are known to walk under your feet and people bring their dogs. If you don't mind the smoking, sit outside. That's the best place to sit.   And yes, parking is a challenge but well worth it.

Came here for all you can eat sushi for $20. I never even knew this place existed, but I was happy when my friends mentioned it. We visited on a weekend and it wasn't too over crowded. I don't love Japanese beer (too damn light for me), but the sushi we had was good. All fresh made so it takes a little while but it's worth it. The moshi soup was yummy, too.

Stay away. Far away. I purchased $500 worth of merchandise here in early December for Christmas presents because I had a 10% back gift card coupon. When I got to the register they would not accept honor the coupon. They said the coupons varied by store and that I could forget the coupon there. I asked the manager and the young woman who was being very rude to me said she was the "team leader". I laughed, told her the policy sucked, and she looked like she was 16 and not in charge. She got irate with me, and told me to shut up or take my business elsewhere. I asked her if she'd prefer I return the $500 worth of stuff I was buying, cut up my Best Buy credit card and never come back. She said definitely. I told her where she could stick it.  I went to customer service to get my refund. I also told the store manager that his team leader was an immature little girl who needed to have a talking to. Her apologized and said she should'nt've told me to not come back, which she did. I refuse to back in there.

Been to a couple CPKs (Tempe, Chandler, and Hollywood) and will always go back. Love their thing crust and usually get a few added things on them. Ice tea and beer are both tasty, too. Great location if you're taking the kid to Harkins for a film or just finished a day shopping in Chandler Mall.  If you want to pick up food, call ahead, and drive right up to the back door to get your food delievered to your car.

BJ's is fun if you're with a buddy and need a quick bite before a movie over at Harkin's. The beer is made on the premises and is really good, they got a ton of huge tvs, sitting at the bar is a good idea if you're not there with kids, and the baked potatoes rock. Pizza is just so so, salads are good, and burgers are just average.

I'd heard about this place from several friends and I had an event nearby, so we headed directly over afterward. The ambiance was perfect. Love it, and this was so nice. It was a cross between throw back 50s and bistro. I loved what Joe's done with it.  I didn't mind the walk up ordering, but adding the tip to the bill before I was even served didn't work for me so I didn't bother. The menu was short, and the wife said the burger rocked. I got the pizza and it was just ok. My wife and daughter got the caprese pasta salad and the serving was very small and tasteless. The woman and man who served us were both very friendly but I didn't really know who got the tip in the end (fortunately, they had a tip jar I could just drop it into).  We also used the restrooms while we were there, and that was pretty cool. I loved the photos in the bathroom and sharing a sink area with the opposite gender was very 21st century. Cool.  Nice place overall. Joe did a good job here, but i would've liked him to have served me my beer :)

Go to place if you want to work/study/meet late. On the weekends they (mostly) do not close at all. On week nights they're open late. If you chain smoke, sit outside. It's nice. If you don't, sit inside. If you want it to be quiet, consider studying/working inside the vault. Yes, this used to be a bank so there's a vault (the door stays open). They have yummy treats like croissants & the baristas are always chill. This is the place to become a "regular" if you can. Across the lot is Revolver Records and an old skool barber shop. You can also get your tired rotated/replaced 100' away. Love this place.

When we moved to the valley almost a decade ago now, we needed a new dentist. My DDS when I was young was my dad's best friend, and I was really worried about a new one. Then I met Stevan Forney and Cheryl. WOW!!  This is like family all over again. My wife and I have been going to see Dr Forney now since about 2001, and they always treat us right. We don't get over charged, over diagnosed or anything. Cheryl runs the front office and we love her. She rocks.   Since we began going we had our daughter go see Forney, my wife's coworker, her boss, and her bosses boss. These men are intelligent administrators who were quite happy with our recommendation as well.   Go see Dr Forney, Cheryl, MJ and the rest of the staff.  You won't regret the decision at all!

I love this place and shop here often. I'll tell you that the reason I stick with REI over other places (including Cabela's which is closer for me) is because of the no nonsense return policy. I know some people take advantage but I don't. If I see something here and it's comparable elsewhere, I buy REI everytime. Whatever's not in the store, they can get me ASAP. I love this location, I love the people who work there, and I'd recommend it to everyone.   I also have compared prices (because ppl complain they markup too much), and I really don't see it. Every now and then, but if I get some boots for $100 somewhere and REI has them for $125. If I buy them online for thr $100 and they die in a year, and I need new ones then I have to pay another $100. If I get them for $125 at REI and they die in a year, I get a new free pair of boots (usually the next model and upgrade).  And you can't beat their garage sales!

The only reason I go to Walmart if either because I was some crap that's dirt cheap or I need a fishing license. Well, it's that time of the year again to get that license! Dropped by later at night when my other errands were over, spent about 5 minutes with the licensing guy, but he said I had to pay up front since he closed his register (10:30PM). He told me I had to go to register 15, too. Now this license for all water ways with trout stamp and two pole stamp was about $60.00, and it was in my hand. A less honest man would've just left but not me.   I wish I had. There were three people in front of me in lane 15 (NO ONE in other lanes), and it took 30 minutes. It was because 1. I was in the only cigarette line! 2. The cashier was very slow. 3. The drawer was not well stocked and she called for change every two minutes.  I got home at 11:15PM, and I am glad my fishing license is good until 2010!!!

This is my local Safeway.   About a year ago they remodeled the whole store, and it's pretty nice. We shop here weekly. The deals are good, the food is fresh, the employees are wonderful. The deli lady and men in the meat department always have cool deals for my family to buy.

I grew up in Pittsburgh and moved away, so I remember this place from my childhood so it was neat to come back later with my own child. They've obviously improved over the years, and in the last two years really added some great aquarium set ups including penguins (there's even an NHL hockey banner in the tank with them!) and a shark tank you can walk under. We really enjoy this zoo, as you can walk among the animals and get close to deer and kangaroo.  As another person pointed out, the food completely sucks here. Terrible, greasy, and god awfully pricey. Pack a lunch!

Last night a colleague and I went to Twitter's Phoenix Friday Nights at this irish pub downtown. The location was easy to find, and for a Friday night it was a well balanced pub without too many people (as you can sometimes see in downtown bars on the weekends) but enough that it didn't look empty. It wasn't too loud but still had good activity, which made it great for a group meeting.  The full bar looked impressive and a bit authentic as you'd see in Ireland. The bars on the menu were well balanced with different types that I enjoy. I order a few half and halfs Guinness/Strongbow which were really good. After awhile the food people were eating around me looked really good, so I ordered the Shepherd's Pie. I enjoy this meal at many places, so I figured I'd try it here. The waitress was very amenable and highly recommended this meal.  When it arrived, the layer of potatoes was very thing and the cheese was sprinkled across the top instead of layered nicely. The meal was too hot so I had to wait quite a bit to begin eat it. When I forked into it, it was definitely tasty but thing and there wasn't a ton to it. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but I just expected more.  The wait staff was great, and since we had about a dozen people and they had to weave between us, they were great. We loved the staff. Nice people, good beer, ok food..

Cash only. My only issue.  I love their red sauce. Just love it. A large bag of chips is $3 and comes with 12 oz of the sauce. A small bag is $2 and comes with 6 oz of the sauce. It's the best red sauce I've ever had.  I love their carne asada, but my girlfriend doesn't like their cheese so I go myself now.

Came here with my 8 year old before a show at Mesa Arts Center, and the young man was easily bilingual which was good for this gringo. He took our order and we got our drinks. I had basic carne asada and the kid had bean and cheese burrito. It took a few minutes but it was all tasty and cheap. Everyone was very nice. Good meat on my burrito. Nothing too stringy or cooked wrong. I'd stop back.

We love this place and can't get enough of it. This is right across from Chandler High School along AZ Avenue, and during lunch times the line is out the door. I like enchilada-style burritos. They are so yummy, and the drink cups are totally huge. I just wish their hot sauces were better.

Wow. Just read review below and now I know it's not a fluke.  Here's mine.....  Saturday morning my daughter and I were interested in getting some bagels on the way home to enjoy with my wife for brunch. It was about 10AM and I was excited that we were close to this Bruegger's. I remember going here often when I lived closer but haven't been there in a while. We went in and got into line after trying to figure out where the front door was. There was a couple in front of us who asked a simple request but the manager told them that they would not do that for them. The woman explained how they could do this and the manager just didn't listen. The couple left without getting their food.   Now it was our turn. My daughter likes cinnamon & raisin and I like cinnamon & sugar. They didn't have either, and then I noticed they didn't have many others. There was very little variety there, and I was disappointed. (Einstein's always has people making more. I didn't see anyone making anything!!!) The manager said she could have the worker wipe butter all over a plain bagel and then pure cinnamon and sugar all over it. I was a little annoyed since they only had like 5 different sorts, so I told them to make it. The worker had no idea and tried to smather butter all over my bagel and then run sugar into the cream cheese I ordered. Terrible. Really worried.   I got my daughter a plain bagel with cream cheese and hoped it would be ok. Really boring and not what she wanted. (They had nothing near what she liked). She was excited to stop to get "doggie bagels" for our puppy, so we asked for these. The guy looked at us like we were from Mars. He said snootily that they didn't have them. I know Einstein's does. I asked if he had anything like this that my kid could feed her dog and he was nasty to us. He told us NO and took our money. Gave us our change, didn't bother to cut our bagels at all, and I was really annoyed and will not go back.  Skip this Bruegger's completely. GO TO EINSTEIN'S!!! They are nice to us, have bagels, and doggie bagels. I felt like I was in ghetto bagel join with mean people.  (Can you give half a star?)

I work nearby at a school, and we order from them for the students all of the time. They give us awesome deals, so we always go back. They're good to us.  Last night my daughter and I went there for an early dinner, and we ordered a pepperoni, black olive and jalapeno pie. It was ready in 10 minutes, and it was really tasty. They said it's chicago style, but it wasn't. It is thin, so it's like a NY-style that I like.   The drink list was limited (carbonated was about it), and I wanted an ice tea. The bathroom is back behind the kitchen and the place is small, but most people who work there are friendly.  You can't beat the price, and they do deliver.

Love the ambiance here, and it doesn't get any better. Don't bother sitting inside; the outside is the place to be. Grab a few beers, get the club sandwhich that has chicken, bacon, AND ham and enjoy!  We use to have ASU classes here when I was in grad school. I love this place.

Recently made some lifestyle changes and one was to shop simpler, so I returned to shopping at Trader Joe's rather than the bigger box less healthy options nearby. My 7 year old loves this place because they have shopping carts that are her size so she feels like this company cares about kids, too.   We tend to go on Sundays and it's always packed then but it's our fault for choosing that day of the week. Any other day, and I know it's easy to get around.   The nice cut fresh flowers by the door just welcome you to enter the store.The produce is perfect and upfront when you come in prior to entering the deli areas. We love the buy the premade salads and lunches but sometimes if you don't eat them right away, the lettuce gets weird. Just watch the date they put on stuff since it's so fresh.   They always have samples in the back corner, including, typically, coffee, juices, some meat, and some times cheese of fruits. One time recently they were closing up one on of the sample stands that had a bunch of grapes on it, so they just gave it to my kid to eat. She loved it. Pushed her cart around and ate grapes.   I think there hamburger could be cheaper but the chicken prices look good. The dairy selection is perfect and they have a kick butt selection of wine and great beers. Typically someone is also sampling wines for the adults to try, too.   Twice now my child has interacted with Samuel, an employee, who first gave her grapes and then sold her some fruit bars on her second visit. He rocks and is very good with his customers. The one lady who runs around with the Peacemakers tattoo seems to have been there forever and knows everything you want to know, and Ron is very friendly too, up selling us on their organic lemonade last weekend.   I've tried Sprouts (not frenetic). I've tried Whole Foods (too damn expensive). We love our Trader Joe's though and will keep shopping here.

Spent some time the other evening at the Fremont Experience in Vegas and suddenly the wafting from below the neon signs called me into Picadilly Pizza. Near the Walgreen's, it's right next to a Liquor store. Grabbed a slice for $5 (it's Vegas after all), piping hot, pepperoni, a few pieces of paper towel (not to mention a few beers from next door) and back onto the road. Great pie and a great late night dinner for everyone.

Well, you pay for what you get. I'd stayed at Mandalay prior to this and OMG it was night and day. I got here early and asked for a great view, which I got. That was the coolest part of my stay. This hotel is ghetto. It's ugly outside but you can forgive that but the rooms feel like they've not been updated since 1973. The wallpaper in Tower 1 looks original; we were on a nonsmoking floor that had to have been a smoking floor at some point. The room had two small lights. One lamp by the bed and an old kind of hanging light over this ugly small table. They do not have wifi in this hotel either. They did have an ethernet (if you have a laptop and not a tablet!). The view rocked but the water pressure in the hotel was practically just a drip; I hated it. It was sooooo 1970s, no wonder I paid $80 a night.

Got no complaints. I showed up here for a lunch alone during a conference and the special was a braised pork taco plate. I checked the toppings closely (don't eat tomatoes or weird things) and it sounded great. As soon as I was seated someone brought me chipotle salsa, which I devoured (two of them!) with chips. When the tacos came out, there was guacamole on them & I was so confused. It said it nowhere on the description. I'd already ate the beams but he immediately took it back and had them remake it (even more beans and yummy rice!)   THe ambiance was upper scale mexican, and I sat outside so I could look over at the Mandalay Pool area. The large fan will keep you cool enough and the seats are totally comfy.

I grew up in this park every summer, worked there when I was a teen, and then moved west. I came back this past June with my daughter wife, and siblings. They weren't packed at all which was cool for us so we could ride the Phantom's Revenge over and over again. That was cool.  The potato patch fries still rock my world.  It was interesting to walk around corners and see something completely new. Some things were really fun, but others I miss like the Haunted Mill.

Been hearing about Lux for months now, and finally I was downtown for something and figured I'd Google Streetview it. When I saw it and where it was, I realized I'd been here like four years ago. I jumped on the lightrail and headed up from downtown since it is only about 4 stops, but I screwed up and got off at Indian School. Don't do this, or you're walking. Stay on one more stop, and you're here!  Walking up to the place, it was pretty cool. Sail material over communal long tables makes it easy to meet new people, or relax in the shade with your caffeine and earphones. I wanted to work inside since I'd planned to stay for several hours (papers to grade!) so I headed in. The line wasn't too bad (I hear it can get bad some hours of the day) and the barista was really friendly. I got my usual (a black coffee) and it was $2.00. No problem. The ambiance struck me immediately. The lights were very soft and easy to work under. There were about 30 people, two dozen of them were on laptops, most were MACs, and since I too am an Apple FanBoy, I was stoked. Grabbed a seat near the cash register across from a beautiful woman studying religion and medicine (checked out her books next to her MacBook). I hate when the coffee is too hot (Starbuck's), and this coffee was perfect. Shot some pics, booted up my MacBookPro, logged into the free wireless, and I've been sitting here ever since. This place is everything everyone has ever said about it. Great great coffee house.  Side note: If you're here and want a great meal, head a (long) block south to George & Dragon for UK Pub food.

Nothing bad to say about this place. The waitress was gorgeous and attentive and we both got their signature bison burgers (named after some chef). It had blue cheese, spinach and was wrapped in ciabatta bread. OMG it was heavenly. I think it was like a $20 burger but it's worth it.  We asked what their seasonal Dogfish Head was and when she mentioned Dogfish Head 190, I was hooked. Of course this beer is $15 a glass but it's made once a year! We both splurged and had a helluva lunch.

Stayed at the conference hotel last week for several days and was happy as a clam. While the hotel is far down south (after 10pm during the week, the tram is closed and you gotta walk!), it was a cool hotel. My room was spacious, the view of the pool rocked, and the bathroom was huge with a tub and tiled shower.   The cons. I'm not sure. I am trying to think of something. I guess the location since it's sooooooo far south (south of Luxor).   Pros. I got there at 9am and was immediately checked in (not sure about some early check in complaint from 9-3).  Never heard about a fee, I just checked right in. They offered me free late check out which I took since I had a workshop until noon. Then they kept my luggage safe for several hours.  If you have kids, you want this hotel. The pool is huge and is world renowned.

Seriously a $15 omelet? I get if it totally rocked or was huge but it was probably a 2 egg omelet with nothing special at all. Got bland warm potatoes and hot coffee (hard to screw up a coffee so no complaints there) but the waitress was barely around. Other people complain about the service and slow pace but there was barely anyone there when I was there, since it was a Wednesday at about 9am. Easy Peasy but too much money!

Love love love love this place. We just love this place.  I started coming to Carly's two years ago now, and over the last year I probably have dinner here twice a month at least. My girlfriend works a few blocks away, so anytime we're doing anything in Central Phoenix in the evenings we come here for dinner first.   Come before 7pm to get the happy hour specials. A buck off beers and half price appetizers are the way to go. I always get the Dale's Deviant Ale and my lady gets a margarita that is usually pretty strong and tasty. We order the Feta Rosa and Artichoke dip both and then split them. The bread is really crunchy so consider ordering all pita with these. If you want more food, then try the Pork Torta. It's to die for. When we only do apps & drinks, we're out the door for two people under $20.  The ambiance is casual, hipster. The servers have always been very nice to us. Sometimes there is live music that isn't too loud. The parking here is easy (park behind if there's nothing out front). The bathrooms are artsy and there is always art from local artists all over the walls. Stop by and try it out. Come before 7 during happy hour. Skip it if it's the first Friday of any month as this place is slammed then.

I went here in November with a really large group and loved the concept. I got the jerk chicken which burned my face off, so when I went back last night I decided to not get that. I was with my kid, and I ordered her a teriyaki chicken. I got myself the Jade Red Chicken because it was suppose to be the best.  The cashier said it would be awhile because there were a lot of people. I said that should be ok, and figured maybe it would be 20 minutes. Forty-five minutes later he brought our food. Hers was a bowl of whiterice with way too much teriyaki sauce all over it. There was NO Chicken at all! I took it back and they dumped cold chicken slices across the top and put on even more sauce. My Jade Red Chicken was dry, overdone and crunchy. Terrible.  And it wasn't even until I got home that I realized they didn't remember to give us our cookies!  I give it 2 stars because the concept is really cool and they have free wifi. Those are the only reasons.

I love Joe and I love Joe's good. I like to grab a few different sorts of meats, some sort of hot bbq sauce, and a lemonade.The beans rock and my daughter loves their mac 'n cheese. That whole corner there in Gilbert, AZ is really cool and I have photographed this often. The entire neighborhood smells like smoked woody bbq.

Damn, this place was fancy and wonderful. This is old skool desert gangster vibe at its best. The square hotel has a large center open area with it's famous swimming pool which reminds me of something smack out of 1970s Miami. I was invited to photograph the Bethel's Halloween Bash & enjoyed the hell out of the evening. This event has been on going for years and that night Zero Zero recorded their latest music video. Everyone was decked to the nines and the roof top bar is the place to be on a beautiful night in the Valley of the Sun.

I've heard about this place before, but last night was the first time we went there. We wanted to grab an ice cream nearby at Baskin Robbin's but it was too busy. I mentioned food to the wife, and Wildflower is good but boring (if you go there a lot, like me). We were with our 4 year old and were told we could sit wherever we wanted, so we grabbed a large table in the back (all the booths were taken).   Elizabeth immediately came over to get our drink order. She was oleasant and never stopped smiling. The menu looked fantastic, and because we'd not been there before, we skipped the more expensive specials menu. Burgers are a staple of bar food so I wanted to begin there. I ordered a blue cheese and pepper corn burger with fries, the wife got the Maryland crabcakes, and we ordered the kid chicken fingers and fruit. My wife also got a cup of French onion soup, which came out relatively quickly.   We both love French onion soup, and it was pretty peppery the way I like it, and it was more of a tomato base like she likes. Good for both of us. We asked for the kid's food as soon as possible since it was after 7pm. A short period of time, her battered chicken came out piping hot. We cut it up and the wafting aroma made our mouths water. We both tried a bite the battered breading cover was savory. We're not sure what it was but it was really tasty for fried chicken fingers. The fruit bowl was perfect for a child, and every  single piece looked great.  My burger did take awhile but that's because I always get them well done (can't stand reddish beef). It was more like an angus patty, and well formed. It was a light brown throughout, and the swiss I asked for was perfectly melted and a nice balance between a tasty bite and smooth finish.   My wife was in the mood for seafood when we went out, and she did order the crabcakes, which came with a house tartar that was different than I'd had before. It was a little spicier and richer. That smothered across the cake, with a little of the pickled cabbage from the plate, was to die for. I am not a big crab cake eater and I liked it; the wife said it was the best she's ever had.   The only reason it did not get 5 stars is 1) there is no wireless. I could run business meetings out of this place if it had wireless! and 2) my fries were burnt and terrible. They have those thin ones that get to crispy too fast. They should change to steak fries and I'd be very happy.

Love this place. We use to go to a nearby ice cream joint, but now this is the place to be. My daughter and I stop by to bring home gelato for my wife all of the time. They have some cool obscure flavors like chocolate chili (love it!) or sesame ginger (you gotta try it, but it's ok to not buy). Enjoyed this all of the time.

I've been here a couple of times and the food pushes it to 3.4 stars, but after the other night I am really frustrated with this place. Don't get me wrong, the food is good but we went last night. The waitress who is actually Polish NOT Turkish asked how many people we had. There were six of us, and she said that we should've called ahead to be accommodated. I looked around, and there was only two other tables of people. one table and a couple and the other had three people who were already done eating. A minute later my friend came in who looked like he knew her, so she quickly sat us.  After about 5-8 minutes, she came over and told us that the computer was down and she couldn't serve us because she couldn't do the taxes. We offered to do the tax on our phones and pay in cash. She just shrugged and walked off. We waited about 7 more minutes to come back. In the meantime she served the other table and threw their plates on the table (they made loud noises it was so hard). Then eventually my friend who said he thought he knew her, went over to see if we could order now. She came immediately to our table, told us the computer was down and she would not serve and that we should leave now. Then she walked away without saying anything.  As I said, I've been here 4 times and the place use to get a 4 (had I reviewed it then), but after being told to leave I DOUBT I will go back anytime soon.

We have large group gatherings here often for sports watching and for wireless/laptop meetings. This place is just ok, but it's close to work, the wait staff is friendly, and all is well. They're even good with my 4 year old running around.

I was here once a few years ago and was stoked to try a new breakfast place since I was staying downtown all weekend. Last time, I thought I remember enjoying it, but this time not so much. First of all, I am going to say that I went there Saturday at 9:30AM and again Sunday at 8:15AM. Saturday was obviously better for me.  Saturday, we a had pretty cool waiter who was attentive enough but I bet it was because he had other tables nearby, so we were easier to wave him over. I got the Chickichanga, which I loved (got it both mornings) but I was annoyed that the onions I asked them to hold was throughout my meal. I could barely taste them and was on a schedule so I didn't complain. My colleague asked for no spinach in her egg skillet, and it was throughout. You cannot miss huge spinach leaves laid through an egg and cheese skillet. She didn't say anything and just ate it. The coffee was just ok, the prices were a little high, and the selection was limiting. The ice tea was good though, and they gave us a to go cup! Not bad. Got them a 3.  Then I come to Sunday. My wife, 4 year old and I went there. There was literally ONLY two other tables of customers. We were seated by someone who looked like a host or manager, but then it was 10 minutes before anyone bothered coming over. I finally went, found her, and asked for coffee. I figured she'd come right over. She walked in the back, talked to someone else, and then a few minutes later a lady ran over with a coffee carafe. She filled us up and didn't bother asking if my child wanted or needed anything. She left. I had to go find someone to order a drink after 5 minutes later for my child.The same lady came back and I asked her her name (I don't remember now) and she said America is my server, but she was helping her out (why? America had ONE other table!). We ordered my kid some milk and then our food. After 15 minutes, I went to find out where the hell my kid's milk was. America brought it right over and also an extra water, then she disappeared without asking if we needed anything else.   At this point, there was 3 server staff (America, the other hispanic lady, and a guy) and only TWO tables (the place is not large, I could see all of the tables from mine). Fifteen minutes later we got our meals. I got the same meal as the day before because I knew what to expect. This time, no onions which was good. We ate, paid almost $30 for three of us (my kid ONLY got toast), and got the heck out of there.   I will not be back.

This place is fantastic. This is a geek's paradise and I go about monthly. I have been there for some of the nerdy events like costume parties. I have been there to meet with students in the cafe area. I have been there for the free wifi, too. As my daughter gets bored with her books and reads harder books, she and I collect up the easier ones and trades them in. Lots of times the trade in decision is really odd and I never know what they want. Sometimes I'll just bring the same stuff in a few days later and now they'll take what they hadn't the week before. Inventory does not change that fast! (and never take the cash trade, it's never worth it). Anyway, this place is cool, the people who work there are uber nice, and you'll find lots of stuff you forgot about from your childhood. The kid section is its own room, too, and they love it.   The old location was better but they needed more room so moved years ago. Yes, the area of town is pretty seedy but Bookman's makes it a lot cooler.

A few years ago I needed a new PCP and my daughter's pediatrician recommended Dr. Lieber. He was close to the home, took our insurance, and was recommended. I went for an initial consult and really liked him. He was quite thorough (without over doing it) and they even do their blood work right there in office. I would suggest Lieber. The only reason he didn't get 5 stars in because I've only been a patient for two years.

When I first moved to Arizona, I needed a PCP. I checked out who took my insurance and such but couldn't get a recommendation because I didn't know anyone. I began seeing Parikh because he was close to my house. The first thing I noticed here was that no one spoke English. The receptionist barely seemed to either and would rather talk to all the loud mexican mothers in the lobby than pay attention to me. I should've left then.  I stay with him for three years. The only real reason was because I had no where else to go and didn't get sick too often. Mostly I went when I had a cold. He'd shove some antibiotics in my hand and send me away. A few times they just called a script in and didn't bother checking me out.  The receptionist who was still there until I ran screaming was always a b*tch to my family and was always mean. She had no customer service experience at all.   If you go see Dr Parikh, plan to spend the ENTIRE DAY WAITING IN A LITTLE ROOM!!!! I have literally waited for hours to see him. My wife was in tears once she had to wait so long, and I've been stuck there for over three hours with a toddler in tow!  Eventually he moved into a nicer office and got some PA person who was always  nice. I eventually left and tried to take my wife with me but for some reason she still puts up with thier crap.

I heard this was the best gyro in town. It was ok. I felt like it had too much going on. My kid has spaghetti and pasta sauce but I had the gyro. Liked the look of the place, easy to get into and out of, and was pretty cool. There were no other people here. The gyro was totally yummy and she ate all her food, too. Not the best for sure, but if you want a gyro in Mesa, go here.

First of all, this address is located at Gilbert & Germann on the north/east corner (the map attached show is north of the 202; it isn't!)  I work locally with teens who go in there all of the time and come back to my crying that they are treated poorly or meanly by the employees. I've worked with a lot of booksellers myself over the years, and so I went in there myself. I was with my young child and treated terribly. I was accused of being a liar and cheat by a bookseller who demanded my ID card while trying to buy something with CASH. It was terrible.   I later called the manager who was just as mean and noncaring as her employees. Forget this place. I now send all my business to the Chandler Mall Barnes and Nobles!!

Not to sure why the other reviews weren't as good, but I like Pei Wei. Yes, this is the same (for the most part) as PF Chang's (same owner) but it's fast food and quicker. It's also a scaled down menu, too.   I like that it's close to my house, so I can just pull up and head in the delivery door.   I don't typically eat inside, but I've been to several Pei Wei's in the valley and this one is good.

I was looking for a place close to home. This place is between my kid's school and our house. I started seeing Dr Stacy three years ago and he seems pretty cool. He can get really chatty and it takes awhile to get through the appointment sometimes, but I'd rather chat awhile than have some impersonal idiot. Been there three years now, and the ladies out front are cool, too.

We love these people. Enough said.   My daughter is almost 5 now, and we were originally recommended to Healing Hearts when they opened to go see Dr. Makenna. The night my daughter was born Dr. Khurana was on duty. We were a little hesitant for all of a minute. Khurana came in, went through everything with us, talked to us, checked out the baby, and was wonderful. We worked with her daily for a week with a few health concerns for our daughter and she was attentive, compassionate and perfect. She'd call us personally at home and everything.  We later did see Makenna and she was just as nice and wonderful, but we stuck with Khurana because we already had a bond. Somewhere in the first months we also met one of their PAs, Nikki, who became our regular person we see when we go. We adore Nikki. She's funny, smart, attentive to our daughter, works with us, is level headed, and always knows when to call a doctor into the room if she's not sure of something.  The practice has grown this past year to another office farther east but we've not been there. They also added more people including Dr Ray, who we really liked, too.   Our daughter's not as sick as she was when she was younger so we're not there weekly like we'd been, but this place is very comfortable, safe, and I would trust any child with this staff.

We've been going here for years, and we went again last night. This is the hands down best place to get Chicken shwarma in the valley. My friends turned me on to Cafe Istanbul a few years ago and even though they moved away long ago, we still go. My mother flew to town this week and the only place she mentioned having to go to while here is Cafe Istanbul!   Some nights there is a belly dancer, and you should always order the lentil soup!

Went in there recently to grab a coffee and my colleague grabbed breakfast. Her food was cheap and looked awesome. I was really excited to try it myself. I came back the next morning with my wife and child. This was a Sunday morning at 8AM. The sign on the door said they were open from 7AM-11AM on Sundays. I was terribly disappointed, and my rating will stay low until I get a chance to go back and try again. Maybe they won't be closed on one of the biggest breakfast mornings of the week (especially when the sign in the window said they would be open!)

Old Skool Vegas at its best. I can't believe how much time I've spent on the Strip throughout the last few years. Friday night I headed from the Strip down to Fremont and couldn't even get close. It was Gay Days in Vegas and there was a parade. As a good photographer I jumped at the chance to photograph the evening. I walked a block or two and found a great spot. I shot the entire parade and came across a few stages. One had a great, gorgeous (she really was a woman) DJ.   After the parade The Nancy Rayguns took the stage and is one of the most talented 80s bands I've ever seen. The next night I headed back to see Rock Candy and Rok of Ages, two great hair hands who played at different stages along Fremont.  The people on Fremont aren't the over rich, dumb drunk women, and ugly hot men, they're real people. Friendly people. Sure there are some ghetto dwellers and we saw two people in smurf outfits take off their costume heads to smoke crack in an alley (I am serious). But Fremont has character! I loved the choreographed lights, loved the music, loved the people, the pizza by a slice, the beers wherever you are, the zip line, I love Fremont.

I was in the neighborhood on a Thursday afternoon and just had to try this out since I believe it's the only Joe's restaurant I haven't tried (often). The look from the outside was great and covered in orange trees. Once you get out of the car, you forget suburbia is so close. It's truly an urban farm. We walked into the retro former Johnston home and walked right up to get our food. The menu had so much to choose from that I got a special bbq chicken sandwich and garlic fries. The garlic and herbs were pulled straight from the farm, diced, and spread over the fries. Awesome.  My friend told me I had to check out the bathroom, which was something out of the Jetson's or Buck Roger's. I don't know what old skool show they were playing (something from the 60s).   Out back was a huge huge tree with tables all over. I loved the sign that said to keep off for fear of falling and scorpions. Lol. My 5year old definitely stayed away. We walked around, took pictures, ate, and checked out the gardens by The Coffee Shop (which I will hit next time).   Thanks again, Joe!

The blonde barista this morning made half my drink and then the phone rang. She answered it, then walked away and started putting together a dozen cupcakes. She just needed to add ice and hand my drink to me! I asked cashier & she said it just needed ice but did nothing to fix it. 3 minutes later cashier added ice and handed it to me. Blonde was still clueless. Now I'm late to work. It's still a great coffee and we patronize them. Just make sure employees are attentive.

Buffalo burger was really dry. Beer was good & they accommodate a group of 8 but it was so boring. I didn't enjoy a dry $12 burger but Frank, our waiter, was nice. Also cheese is an extra dollar, so is peppers, etc...  Took forever to get the bill.

I live a mile from here and trust me when I say I've been here a lot. It used to be our go to place for a quick dinner when we didn't want to cook. It also used to be the place we'd go for group get togethers in the back room. The bartenders and servers were always awesome and friendly, even remembering our names and favorite beverages. The food was pretty good, too.   Now let's jump ahead to now. Over the last year new management has taken over. This was an Irish Pub and pretty authentic feeling, but the new owner has a family member who plays for the Seahawks (American) football team so it's quickly becoming an NFL sports bar.   Happy Hour used to be from 4-7 which is great for those who work 8-4 and 9-5. Now they changed it to 3-6, which means by the time we start thinking of going out for appetizers and drinks, everything is full price again. Used to have great half price appetizers, but you can forget that now!  My friend wanted a burger the other day and brought the 8year old with her. Was going to give the kid some of her burger, but the server said it was $2 to split a meal now. She's a little girl and barely eats anything, but the server was practically scared that her manager would find out. She said if her manager came out and discovered it, then he'd charge the lady for two meals. That's ridiculous!  As I said, we used to come here all the time but this last year the changes have been terrible. I will be going elsewhere in the future.

I didn't even make it inside... that is just how wonderful the patio is. I grabbed a table near several groups of really friendly locals, artists, musicians, students, all who gathered for great burgers and even greater brews. The beer menu changes often so they even have an app for your phone that updates what's on tap here. The burger I ordered and salad my friend had were both fantastic and the ambiance outside is great if you like the local, artsy feel with friendly staff and customers.

Bogi, Austin, and crew treat their customers right! I came here the first time in the summertime, needed new brakes, and fluids. I was there a few hours in the waiting room where I had free wifi & Keurig coffee. I came back in October and then again in January for a check up and oil. They're always so helpful and I can schedule easily. If you work not too far away, I hear, they offer a shuttle service, too.   I love that this is a local business, and owned by a lady. It's in Melrose & is very welcoming. They don't BS you and try to steal your money, and if something needs to be adjusted you can stop back in. They rock.

Love me some Dick.  Had to kill an hour so I stopped in here for a light lunch. Wow, there's nothing light in here. My "sampla platta" was huge for one guy. The bartender Kevin was awesome. He immediately was crass and swearing but this is what you get in Dick's. They even have a sign that says 21+ so no kids and for a good reason! They yell at you and swear and are sarcastic. I loved it all. They let me sit and nurse a beer for an hour and eat. My only issue was $11 for a beer! You get a free plastic cup that I didn't want and forgot to take home, but other than that this place rocked.

I want to like/love this place & it smells oh so good, but I just can't. The food itself is pretty good but costs too much money. I've been here half a dozen times (only once on my choice), and the food is yummy. But I've been trying to justify the prices and can't. I eat a lot of BBQ and this is the most expensive I have ever had. The last two times I've been on the patio with a group of 6-10 each time. The place has NOT been packed and it's been week nights, and you know what? The waiter acts like we don't matter. He acted (two different one) like we've put him out when we wanted more drinks. He would drop something off and run off before checking if we need anything else. The last time we were there was this past Tuesday evening. It was just terrible. I'm not going back.

When I want to eat well, I go here. It's big and beautiful, and I love shopping here. They don't have anything that's not natural (hence their name), so if you want A1 or something like that, forget it. But if you want to eat well, buy fresh and find a ton of new things, go here!  I also meet up with a group #EVFN here often, since it's close to my house. They accomodate us very well, give us discounts, and welcome us back everytime. The buffalor burger and cheese plates are the best.  If you like beer, come here. You can drink it here, or take it home. If you want to try a new beer, the staff is well versed and can reccomend varietals.   My only hesitation (hence the 4 stars) is that when buying organic you pay more; here you will pay more than places like Safeway.

Been here off and on but never for this long. I've been working here today for 5 hours so far because I was nearby when they opened. I had a drip coffee and loved it. So tasty and made cup by cup. Then a black mango tea that was the perfect aroma and need nothing. Later in the morning a friend came in and purchased a cappuccino. OMG it was the prettiest thing I've seen so I had to buy one. I have NEVER had a better one in my life. I am serious. Come here. Drink here. I love their iPad cash register & art. Late Sunday mornings the wifi gets a little clogged from the number of people but it's a cool joint.   PS. I know Jeff M. had issues with their customer service but the two ladies working today rock.

Looking for a new place to try not too far from home but far enough. Ended up at Solo after reading a friend's review on arizonacoffee.com. The barista was way friendly and laid back. Got a ginger peach tea that was oversteeped, but the ham & cheese croissant was awesome. Tried a mocha next, and thought it was kinda cool that it didn't come in the traditional sort of coffee cup. Really enjoyed it. I hate drinks that are too hot and this was just right. Been here 90 minutes today and feel like I just slipped into a place like a comfortable glove. Great place to work, grade, and chill. Free WIFI, Too!

We were looking for lunch last Saturday and drove by this diner. I've seen it before with its tell tale bear statues, but this time we were looking for something new and eclectic. This is what we got! We were seated pretty quickly and Jeff took our drink orders. He was a little goofy but in a really pleasant way. They were testing a new kid's menu that we thought worked really well for our daughter. My wife got lunch and I ordered breakfast. Sure, it took a little while to get the food but that was ok because there's so much to see and look at. The food was large portions and good. It was immensely awesome, but it was pretty tasty.

We wanted sandwiches and this is near home. My parents love this place in PA, so we decided to stop by. My lady was hesitant since sandwich places usually make a great meat sub but then skimp on the veggie people. This time not so much. She said the veggie was awesome! My kid had a meatball and loves them. I had the steamer that I think I get each time. They have maybe 40 different hot sauces in bottles to try there, so I always love that, too.

We came here recently for lunch, and it just took too damn long. We didn't order anything wild, and the food was just ok. The appetizers came after the food, but the waitress tried to make up for it with a smile.

I come here to do research because the wireless is pretty fast, but I am pissed that there policy is to filter whatever the hell they want. The food is just ok. The soup is average and the salads are pretty good once I modify there regular ones. I don't like their sandwiches at all. Really, I only come here for the ice tea. I like free wireless and I like ice tea.  They need more booths with outlets, and they need to turn the AC DOWN! It's FREEZING in there!

This place is just ok. It looks nice and we hoped for the best but it felt like a large fake chain. We had a large technology group who wanted to meet there and they claimed to have wireless, but their signal was terrible and their hardware wasn't worth it. We asked them to help accomodate us and that we'd be bringing back large groups again, but they didn't seem interested in our business and we've not been back since.

Went there last week to get some work done with a colleague. The beer was cheap and the food was plentiful (typical sports bar food). They have FREE wifi, which is always a plus. It pretends to be an Irish Pub but it's more like an Irish Pub and local Sports Bar mashup. I was annoyed that our waiter asked if we needed anything else about every 10 minutes for two hours.  After three hours of this (and yes we were eating and drinking, not just sitting) we met up with a group of our friends (#evfn) and moved to a private room that was quite accomodating. We had two servers back there who kept everything straight for our group of 30+ people.

Went here Saturday night with 8 people after a conference at MCC (nearby). We wanted to talk and many of us hadn't seen each other for months, but we should've checked. See it was fight night and the speakers were TURNED ALL THE WAY UP! I am not talking about loud, but I am talking that I personally could not hear my friend sitting one foot away. We were very annoyed and almost canceled our order. We asked the waitress to ask the bartender to turn it down just a little (the fight hadn't even started yet!) and he said NO. We were not happy, ate and left quickly.  A few other notes. The beer selection has become very limited. Fat Tire, Kiltlifter and few "Irish" beers, but the Cork Burger and Mac&Cheese were awesome.  If you want football, they have it. Opens at 9am Sundays for NFL & each area features a different game. The booths have TVs on booth (come early!) and the fans are really fun.

I really wanted to like this place. I was a first time customer and my lady had been before. I ordered a beer, which was definitely good, but I also ordered the calzone which was not good at all. I asked for sauce on the side, but it was filled with sauce. I don't love chunky sauce, so I use it sparingly. With it inside it was almost a waste. When I got to the middle it was cold. I was so disgusted by the entire experience. My lady told me to send it back, but we were in a hurry and didn't have time to wait for another. Nice location, bad product this time.

I was pretty excited to try this place because I was looking for a good barbershop near home (i.e. NOT greatclips) and the price felt right. I went in for a clipper trim and wanted my beard done, too. A barbershop should be able to do beards, and have straight edge razors to do behind the ears an neck. I got some girl who must've not been much older than 17 who seemed completely unsure how to cut men. I had to tell her to use the clippers on my head (my hair was about 2 inches and I wanted half off - not something you can do with scissors!). Then she edged my neck with a closer clipper instead of a razor, which was ok.   I asked her to do my beard because she looked like she was finishing up. She asked me how to do it. (?!) I told her to use the clipper blade, trim it around, scissors on the edges, level out the edge on my neck and shave around the edges. She just looked at me and grabbed the clippers. She did the main parts and then had no idea how to do my moustache. She struggled with it, and completely skipped my neck. I was totally disgusted by this time and just let her stop.   Sure, they got good deals on haircuts, but I got charged over $20 for the beard. I was royally annoyed and won't be back, ever.

Last Sunday we needed a place to work that had wifi, beer, and a good breakfast. This place was suggested by a friend, and we got there at 8AM when they opened. We grabbed some tables in the back by the electricity (for our laptops) and ordered breakfast. I got a great pasty and the potato pancake part was awesome. Coffee is just coffee, so you can't really screw that up.  Later I had an awesome Shepherd's Pie and reasonably priced beer. We drank, ate, and worked for about eight hours straight without any complaints from anyone.   Wifi was fast and reliable, and the place was clean and tidy. I will go back soon.

Went with my family this summer. We love Thai, but damn the spice levels make the food uneatable. order HALF your usual spice level. The pad thai was good, and make sure you sit on the patio. Get the Pad Thai. Yes, Paid Thai. Do it. That & Thai Tea. Yum!

I was looking for a barber but mostly ran into old guys who had thick accents and did their kind of barbering without really listening to what I wanted. My buddy told me to try Electric Haven so I went today. Erik offered me a beer while I waited and then when it was my turn, he listened to what I wanted and got down to work. I have long hair and wanted a slight trim. 1/4". And that's what I got. Just a quarter of an inch. If I would've gone to Great Clips they would've taken 2" and not listened. I also wanted my beard trimmed and he took it slowly. Very slowly. He made sure it was just enough without going too far at all. He said if I needed more off to stop back. I paid $20 total. I was impressed. ERIK is now my barber and I will be back soon. Did I mention the 8th cut is free?

Not really sure why the more recent reviews are terrible, but this place still rocks. Go on Monday night to have ERIK do your cut. He's totally friendly, great conversationist, and cuts what you want and nothing more. I've gone probably a dozen times. A few haircuts and lots of beard trims. It's cheap & quick.

This review is specifically for Dr. Richard S. Funk. He is terrible!  We had a ferret who was very sick, and we had heard he was an expert with ferrets (he'd come highly required). I got an appointment with him and hurried there. Once there I was just like another number, and he treated me worse than the patients. He barely would touch my animal, and I didn't understand what he was telling me. My wife called while I was with him and she had questions. He refused to answer them.   I would never ever take any animal back to this vet hospital again. EVER.

Took my kid here so she could research PA history for school, and it was pretty good. Lots of different things to see and different floors. The Heinz exhibit was cool, too. The price was pretty good for students and such, too. Parking sucked but it was a cool place.

Go from brunch and get the breakfast nachos. OMG. They were to die for. red chile sauce, two cheeses, baked chips, chorizo eggs. Got sour cream on the side and left of the pico. Came with sausage gravy that was not the artery cloggin' kind. These were so yummy.  It was a little dark inside (full out front) and they don't have sweet & low. Nice ambience. Totally cool for the kids, too, but no paper kids menu.

I'd been hearing about this place via Twitter, #evfn, etc... for weeks and last week @rrodrigo & I were looking for a place to work on some RSS research we were doing. We hit Gangplank during lunch time and it was dead. We had our pick of places to hang out, so we grabbed a table and got to work. There were some people working in rooms around, thinking up the next best project, and it didn't feel weird at all grabbing some chairs and collaborating. After the lunch hour a ton more people came in, and I knew many. We said our hellos and everyone got to work. This was a great experience and we'll be back soon.

I ain't got nothing bad to say about this place except I didn't go sooner.   My kid and I were looking for a lunch this past June and rolled by this place about a mile from our house. I was curious and headed in. We really weren't sure what to expect but since I've spent some time in the UK, I was intrigued.  The atmosphere is very cool. Industrial type metal tables, with candles burning on the tables and long wooden church pews for people to share tables.  The waitresses (we've been back since) are really cool and completely unique from each other.   My kid had a PB&J pasty, and I ordered the Cajun Chicken. I loved mine, and hers was so big she couldn't finish it. The next time I got the Rosemary Chicken, which I love almost as much as they Cajun. I am a picky eater but both of these were awesome.   They do take a little time to cook your food, which means it's fresh. And if you call ahead you can special order (like no onions or whatever). They also deliver within a few miles of their location (including my house and MCC where I work!).   I hear the desserts rock, too!  I will keep going back.

Wanted to end up at Quiet Storm but they were closed so Voluto's was recommended to me. I figured I'd try it since mostly I was looking for caffeine and coffee. The menu was small and I saw they had French press on there; I've never had a french press so I ordered that and a croissant. They make their coffees fresh so I waited a bit but I wasn't in a hurry. They brought it over to my seat and OMG it was HEAVEN. Wonderful! The smoothest coffee I've ever had. The croissant was good, too. The two baristas were wonderfully friendly and helpful. The place was clean and new; the large windows gave a lot of light. The only thing I wished was more seating... it was a little small. I had to sit at a long bar sized table with others. I would've liked to spread out more. Other than that, fabulous.

I came here for Happy Hour on a week day. Last time I was here it was good but this time not so much. I was with three black ladies (I'm a white guy), and they were treated terribly by our white female server. She wouldn't take orders, walked away when people were ordering and all together being very rude. When I'm there with my white friends, our service rocks. There's this cool dude who serves there and he helped us out, but this was terrible. The sushi came old and oddly colored and the food was just so so. The calamari tasted way too fishy and we talked to the manager who apologized over and over. I will give them another try but I hope that waitress isn't there.

Took a large group here last night, and it was pretty cool. As others have said, it's not your typical rough and rustic Irish Pub so if you want that, you're in the wrong place. We asked what the beers on tap included and most bars around here start by naming crappy domestics. Not The Turf. They don't carry those. Got drinks quickly and ordered food. Everything looked pretty good, so I had a fish sandwich, which definitely can be screwed up. This surely wasn't. It was almost not enough fish, but it was so yummy that didn't bother me. The waitress was just ok, but maybe she wasn't use to serving 15 people.  They have free WIFI, and that's always a plus for our group. Nice location, parking available, and good times.

Ok, I really went here wanting to like it. I did. I really did. The outside is really pretty and the inside is clean. It's just north of Joe's Real BBQ, which is a great location.  We went for a light breakfast kind of snack and caffeine on a Saturday morning. I was pretty unimpressed with the muffins that looked like it was a package deal from Costco, rewrapped and placed out like they were home made. They had some sort of Little Debbie snack cakes there, too. Nothing at all substantial or healthy. They also had lemon bars (my daughter got one and would barely eat it).  My wife liked her Mocha, but I had ordered a Chai Lattee and he iced it. I did not ask for it iced. I didn't say anything, since the guy behind the counter was really nice. I took it outside to drink in the yard, and it was terrible. I'm not sure why I didn't complain right then, but I sucked it down and dealt with it.   Now I was at about a 3-star review at this point because the wife's mocha was good, the kid's soy (can't screw this up) was fine, too.  Then I got in the car and headed to a few errands before going home. I got sicker and sicker to my stomach from the drink. To the point where I had to lie down for 90 minutes when I got home to try to feel better.  Skip this place. Go across the street to the coffee bar in Liberty market!

Recently my family and I were searching for a place to camp during Spring Break 2009, and since the winter had been so cold up north we knew we had to choose carefully if we wanted to not be too cold at night. A few friends recommended different places, and the wife and I finally agreed on Burnt Corral on Apache Lake three miles south of Roosevelt Dam. Initially a large group was going but everyone fell out except for us. The Burnt Corral Campground descriptions I found said that the temps were mild, there was swimming and fishing, and it was within two hours of our home.   There are two ways to get to Burnt Corral. One is through Apache Junction and up the Apache Trail. The other is to take the Beeline Highway north and cross back before you hit Rye, AZ. I had heard the Trail was very scenic but a harder drive. I also knew it was a shorter distance, so we figured it was the best way to go. I didn't realize that this was 22 miles of unpaved, pot holed, dirt road. I enjoyed the drive, but the wife didn't like it so much; she would've been more scared if the GPS didn't show up exactly where we were.  After about 90 minutes we pulled off Highway (if you can call it that!) 88 and down to the campground along Apache Lake. We pulled into a mesquite grove with limited shade, and I had expected more greenery but I was ok with the site we found. We drove in around 2pm on a Friday and most sites were already filled with people. The flat area below was very crowded and was completely open where you were up against your neighbors, so we opted for a site up the hill a bit. Our site had a large mesquite tree that gave us some shelter, but this also dripped some sap on our camp. Because we were camped near the lake, gnats and mosquitoes were all over the place (but they never bit us). After setting up camp a man two sites over was playing his music loudly but because it was midday and quiet hours weren't until 10pm, there was nothing we could say.   When research camp grounds online, I went to http://www.camparizona.com; this site said that I could buy firewood from the host. While we were unpacking the site, the Forest Service came around to check tags. I asked about the firewood and he said the hosts do NOT sell firewood and the closest place to buy it was 16 miles away! Seriously. We also had forgotten some other things, so I made the round trip 32 miles (of which 8 miles were on the Apache Trail). This wasn't cool, but I was only gone for about 75 minutes.  When camping in AZ we try to find something cooler that the valley, and this was not that place. It was in the 80s and really sunny; at night it dropped to 50s and 60s. One night I wore my fleece and shorts and the other night I only had on my pants and tshirt. In our attempt to go somewhere not to cold, we ended up somewhere almost too warm. That was ok with Claire who immediately was drawn to the beach. It was a sandy beach without fear of rocks. Other little children were sprinkled across it, but to my chagrin, I didn't realize that Apache Lake doesn't have limits on boat noise. Believe me that these speed boats was very loud!   If you're looking for a quiet, peaceful place, this is not it. Also, this place is close to Apache Junction and some of the locals were obviously here. The man with the loud radio, also played it at 1AM. I was just glad we could fall back asleep. By the second night when he was playing the radio again at 2AM, Donna went over to yell at him. The next morning we complained to the Forest Service Ranger who asked him to leave the camp immediately.   Moreover, we did get to do some fishing, but most spots were too choppy from the boats or too shallow. Claire and I walked down the trail to the north side of the camp and found some rocks that dropped of into the lake where she proceeded to  reel in a 10" small mouth bass within minutes. I shot several photos and then tried to catch myself one, but after about an hour we gave up. I was concerned about killing and gutting the fish in front of her, but I wasn't about to sugar coat it. I was being honest with her, and gutted the fish together, and Mama picked us up.  We spent three days camping here, and I am not about to run back there, but we sure did have a nice time, met some nice people (with a daughter Claire's age), swam each day, got too much sun, played cards, ate smores, and took naps.

OMG! My lady lives nearby & suggested we get drinks before going out one night. Told the really awesome friendly young barista to pick for me. I said I needed "yummy & lots of espresso". I ended up with an off menu Bob Marley. I have never ordered anything else since then. I love Dutch Bros for sure. The only time I get coffee elsewhere when I am over there is when I want something more substantial than a muffin to eat, also.  I love this one, I love the ASU one, I love the Rural Road one. Dutch Bros is the place to go. Get your card punched! I swear every day is double punch day!

If you need medical assistance, do not go here.  Last year my daughter had some constipation issues and was pretty sick. My wife and I were worried and brought her in to get her seen. She was also dehydrated, so we wanted an IV of fluids. We waited in the waiting room for 2 1/2 hours (I am not kidding) to be seen, after we told them her problems and signed her in. We finally got a room, they asked some questions, and told us they didn't do IVs. They said the doctor would be in soon to see her. We waited and waited. There was literally almost no other patients in the entire place. None. We didn't see anyone who didn't work there. I even opened the door and kept it open so I could wait for someone and they didn't forget us. After another hour of not being seen, my daughter was really cranky. One of the employees came over and told us we had to close the door because she was too disruptive. They said the doctor would be in. We already paid our $50.00 or we would've walked out. The reason she was cranky was she was hungry so we finally fed her one of those kid nutrition bars. After another half an hour the doctor came in and said that they only thing they could do for her was an abdomen x-ray. We weren't too happy, but we agreed. They did the x-ray and after another half an hour (it's pushing 4-5 hours now!) the doctor came in and told us she had a mass in her abdomen that was larger than she'd ever seen! She had already called our pediatrician who immediately called our cell phone and told us we needed to get her to Children's Hospital downtown immediately. We were terrified and so was out doctor. We drove up there really fast through the rain; they took her in, sedated her, gave her an IV (something Urgent care should be able to do!), and ran a CatScan. After the doctor came in to read the results, he asked if she'd eaten recently. Of course, she had. After hours of waiting for an urgent care doc. The mass the stupid urgent care doctor saw was her food bar she'd eaten! She was fine and went home. We have never been back.  Then this past weekend our friend's son split open his knee at his sister's birthday party, and the mom immediately took him to urgent care. I wasn't there yet, or I would've stopped them from going to NextCare. But they went down to NextCare for stitches. Two hours later they called us and told us they'd just gotten into the room. A half an hour later they called back and told us the NextCare does not do stitches and they were sent to the hospital. I can't believe it. What good is an Urgent care that can't see patients quickly, can't sew up an incision, can't use IVs, and can't tell the patient to leave before taking their money. The receptionist should be able to tell someone not to bother paying $50 and wasting hours to be told to leave anyway. It's robbery, and I hope people read this and don't go there!

Simply put, the service was slower than Moses. But the food wasn't bad.  We were going to Southwest Shakespeare Company tonight to see Taming of the Shrew and met here for dinner. The patio was a great idea as it's one of those lovely January evenings. There were maybe 4 full tables of 2-3 people total at this place when we arrived. We ordered appetizers and the first was quick but then the chicken satay took twice as long as expected. When we ordered the second appetizer, we ordered our meals. I believe we all had the pad thai (three of us). Nothing too difficult to prepare, but we left waiting... and waiting.... and waiting. I took an hour for our meal, which was too long for a smaller place without a lot of people on a a Friday evening. No less than 5 different wait staff attended to us at different times through the evening so they weren't understaffed. "Our" waitress (blond haired) apologized for the slowness and said she "yelled at the kitchen staff for" us. When we paid the bill, we noticed someone named Joey was supposed to be the waiter. I am pissed that anyone other than this waitress would receive the tip. I hope that didn't happen. Don't know if I will be back here anytime soon. There's a new mexican place across the street; I may go there next time.  Oh yes, as for the food. I have had better pad thai. I asked for a 5 and it was almost too hot to eat. Very sad indeed.

I should not have to wait 10 minutes to have the waiter bus an outside table where I am sitting. There was trash all over it from the last person, and the waiter said he'd be right back to clean the table. Ten minutes isn't "right back". Then after he cleaned the table, he took another 10 minutes before getting our drink order. The outside tables were pretty fool but I checked inside and there were very few people there, so the busyness was not an issue. this is just an altogether fail. We ended up only doing drinks because we were disgusted with the place.

Best Mexican food around. I teach at a local high school & we come here often to get good food. I love their Carne Asada burrito and the main cashier knows my order so he punches it right up. Their red hot sauce is really good, too. This is good for eat in (but not a lot of seats) or take out.

Get there early & bring your own booze. It's BYOB (I believe there's a glass charge). You come here for yummy food but more so the ambiance outside. We got here later on a work night and waited twenty minutes to sit outside (no one sites inside when it is nice). I ordered my Pad Thai and love it. It's what you want to eat there, too. The wait staff took too long or they would've gotten 5 stars.

Went here with a few of the regulars. It's a small ma & pa diner in McKees Rocks. I ordered the #2 and both the bacon and sausage were to die for. Thick bacon & really tasty sausage patties. The eggs were made exactly how I asked and the pancakes were thick and awesome. I am stickler for good coffee and had no issue with this blend at all. I enjoyed driving into McKees Rocks as it hearkens back to the old river small town feel. Give it a shot. The other review I read here on Yelp was incredulous and did nothing for this place. I just did not have the same experience. Good stuff.

I had a groupon. When I pulled in I asked what would be covered. They said the entire outside and inside. I drove my car through and the outside was done. Then I pulled over the cleaning people so they could do the inside. I went inside to wait and when I came out after 20 minutes they said they were done. Looked ok and I was distracted so I took off. I had to go to Walgreen's to get meds, and then I noticed the window was dirty. I started looking around my car and no plastic or glass was cleaned at all. UGH. 1. I didn't have time or I would've gone back, but the people who "cleaned" the inside couldn't speak English anyway. 2. When I went into Walgreen's I just bought read: spent more money) wipes and did the inside myself.   I expect when I pay for a full car wash that my car is cleaned completely. I cleaned everything out so they could get to everything and the dash wasn't cleaned, the inside glass wasn't, the door jambs were dirty, etc... Ugh. I'm not sure if I will be back to this car wash. It used to be better here.

This is my favorite Sharp Edge of them all. Get anything to drink and feel free to ask the barista if you have an idea of what you like... then order the Buffalo Blue bites and just enjoy them so much. If you need more food, start with Onion Soup. :)

I moved away from Pittsburgh several years ago and when I visit there are certain places that I must eat or drink. Sharp Edge is a must. I love their Buffalo Blue bites and, of course, beer. I am an IPA kinda guy and was headed to a concert on North Shore tonight, so dinner at Sharp Edge on Penn Ave was a perfect idea. I hate to say that  I was wrong. Sure it was a little busy but I didn't have to wait at all. The host said they weren't sitting people outside because it was suppose to storm so I acquiesced to a booth inside. The guy who came up to serve me looked like the Pittsburgh Dad from that YouTube show. He asked if I wanted a drink and I said "bring me the best IPA on draft"... he proceeded to open the menu, point at the Belgian draft menu, and told me everything was happy hour process so to "pick one". I was flabbergasted since 1) these are NOT IPAs and 2) waiters at Sharp Edge really should know beers. I responded "these aren't IPAs at all, so I will need to figure this out by myself." He said "ok" and walked away. I was shocked. At that point, I almost went to sit at the bar but there weren't lots of seats there.  I got up to check the menu on the wall. The Terrapin Hopzilla sounded good, so when he (finally) came back, I ordered one. I also got the buffalo blue bites, and he asked what sauce I wanted. Doesn't that come with buffalo blue sauce? Every other time I've ordered this for over a decade, every Sharp Edge person gave it to me the correct way without asking.   A different guy brought me my drink. A third brought me my food, eventually.   My guy came to give me my bill, eventually. By then, a skinny white man in a tie came by and I asked if he was the manager. He said "something like that". I told him I was disappointed that my waiter didn't even know the difference between Belgiums and IPAs. He just chuckled. I told him I was hoping my experience at the McMurray store (where we have a dinner party scheduled later this week) will be better. He said he'd trained there, but he did NOT address my concerns about my waiter at all. He pretty much ignored my concerns. I was unhappy with this experience.

Can't say anything bad about this please, and believe me I've reviewed some bad places before. I love 910 LIVE.   I am a local concert photographer and shot A LOT. When I'm hired for a show at this venue I jump at the opportunity.   If you didn't know it was there, you'd probably miss it. But get off McClintock at 202 and headed a 1/4 mile north. It's on your left at the corner. The front is unassuming and mostly you'll end up going in the side door. This side door opens to the rear of the venue that is absolutely huge. It's essentially a concrete slab in the back with those hugh 10' tall shipping containers stacked on top of each other to make back walls. It's very cool. There is elevated seating all along one side where if you stand or sit you can see over the center floor crowd to the large stage. One of of this area has a bar that opens onto the back of the actual building. Beers are absolutely reasonable and they carry domestic and all local craft brews, too. Their whiskey is in line with many Tempe haunts (not the over expensive Scottsdale prices).  I mentioned the stage because it's great. As a photographer I've been to some stages where the lights are so bad it is tough to even begin to shoot a show, but both the lighting and sound here are top notch. There is a large rigging that goes about 20' up behind and above the front of the stage so lighting is not an issue. The guy who runs sound here (may even own the place, he's white and bald) is an absolute perfectionist when it comes to his audio. It's always great.  Sometimes between bands on large shows, they do floor shows. They once had this art group of women with metals plates attached to bikinis, they danced around, and had metal grinders shoot sparks off their bodies. You are definitely in for a treat at 910 Live.   I mentioned the outside stage, but there's also an inside stage. The two stages back up to one another so they can open this large garage door and move equipment between the two stages quickly. While the inside stage is much smaller, the lights are still good, and it's intimate. I've seen the inside totally packed and everyone loved the show. They just danced together as a big unit and enjoyed the show.  Bouncers are great and don't give me hassle when I need to move behind the rope to get side stage shots or even shots from behind the bands. They've always been accommodating and friendly, but they also run a tight ship and I've never seen anyone get unruly at this place. For the bands, they also have a "green room" which is a green trailer that sits off to the side of the stage. Inside is a bank of theatre mirrors and a prep table, comfy couches and chairs, and a private bathroom with shower. Good area and good times completely at this venue.

OMG This place is fantastic!   My kid and I ended up in Tempe Sunday morning and were hungry. I jumped on my phone and typed in "breakfast" & this was closest. The reviews were good so we headed that way. The menu looked limiting & I was looking for a full breakfast but we were already there. My kid got a basic bacon, egg & cheddar bagel, and I was between Turkey Diablo & Greek Burrito. The cashier told me I absolutely must try the Turkey Diablo. That burrito was peppered turkey, jalapenos, egg, and cheese. Wow. It was so tasty! The jalapenos were just enough, the turkey was awesome. The salsa they gave me was so tasty and they had 6 different hot sauces from which to choose. We asked for a side of fruit (not on the menu) & she quickly agreed and I think charge me a buck for blueberries, strawberries and bananas. Yum! The kid got a lemonade (they offered her a free refill when were going to leave) & I had tea. The only reason I got the yummy tea was because I checked in on FourSquare and they had a special for buy a drink, get a drink. :) This was one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time!

It rained on my child's birthday and she wanted minigolf. We live in the east valley and loaded up grandpa and her best friend and drove 30 miles across town to go here. The website said they had amusement park rides, minigolf, etc... Well, let me tell you, it was a waste of our time.  The amusement rides were the little fiberglass ones the kid sits in and you put a coin in. Very small and two were broken.  Mini golf was kind of cool and cheap enough, but one hole had a paper cut for the hole because the regular "real" hole was missing.   After playing a round of golf, the kids wanted to play in the "arcade". I was contemplating how many tokens to buy, and the employee said "don't buy too many, most of our stuff is broken anyway". I should've left then but I bought $10 worth thinking it couldn't be that bad. I was so wrong! Air Hockey worked but it was smaller than regulation sized table and didn't keep score for you. One of 6 arcade driving games worked. The rest sat there gathering dust. There was one single pinball game and my ball got stuck after about 30 seconds. I went to the employee, she rolled her eyes and walked over with the key. She reset something and walked away without a word. Thirty seconds into my next game it did it again! I was not about to ask again. I would say of the 18 machines they had, 5 may have worked and they sucked. The only one that worked the way it should've was the one that scooped up and gave free candy (I don't even want to know how old it was!) to the kids. (Thanks, a lot!).   Grandpa and my wife were sitting at a nearby table while I was with the kids playing. As I said, it rained that day. Not three feet from where my family sat, a hole in the ceiling dripped rain on the next table and there was a large puddle on the floor. As we got to the bottom of the bucket of coins the two women employees gave us, we found staples lying there. There were a few sharp staples at the bottom of the cup, and we were appalled. If the little kids stuck their soft-skinned fingers into there eagerly, then we would've been on the way to the hospital for tetanus shots.   By this point i was completely disgusted. I went to wash my hands before we left and there was no water pressure in the bathroom sink. It was barely a trickle. It was the same for my wife in the women's room. We quickly wrapped up the kids and left ASAP.  There's a huge FOR SALE sign on the side of the building. No wonder it's for sale, the current people have let this place go. It's really ghetto and scary. DO NOT go here!   This is for the Phoenix location. I've not been to the Mesa location.

Wow. A gem near my house. I'd never been there til a friend wanted to meet up. We're craft beer drinkers and there was a ton of draft. It was late at night and the one I wanted was out, but they had a ton more.   I'm also a burger guy and the burger was awesome. They gave me exactly what I wanted, and bartender/waitress came by just enough to be attentive and not annoying. I felt very welcome here, got exactly what i ordered, was offered a sample of a few beers before I bought, and was able to watch four large screen HD tvs showing the ball games and Olympics. Great place ... I'll be back.

I've been to lots of music venues but never here. I was here for Of Monsters and Men in June 2013. The 5500 head venue has a contract with Coors Light so the closest to a real beer they have is Killian's (and at $7.00 a 12oz, I've had more expensive). I had a GA PIT ticket (which I prefer) and got there 15 minutes before doors opened. The line was around two blocks already so go early! The sound was good. The people were friendly. You CANNOT bring in umbrellas so lots of people dumped them along the queue. Someone from the venue, during the show, picked up all the umbrellas and stacked them outside the front gate so people could get them back. That was considerate. I will be back to this venue. (This is for the outside stage).

Great venue. Out front they have a stocked bar and always several great craft beers on tap. We've been maybe a dozen times over a year or two, and it's always enjoyable. We saw Scott Pilgrim here and are always impressed by the number of awesome old skool films playing. The holiday series films are really good, too. Stop by anytime!

Buddy and I went here during a conference recently and OMG it was awesome. Sinead our waitress was very cool (just call her "Red"!) and the September special is a steak pie, which I ordered. It was huge and the crust was really pasty and tasty. The bartender took way too long for my beers (it's just beer!) so you don't get 4 stars. Everyone had these awesome Irish accents and Sinead said it was a must, but the black (ever see one in Ireland?) manager did not. Weird. Great location. My buddies' sandwich rocked, too. Try this place, seriously.

Friend is the manager so down here for lunch. I'd been hearing about this and was treated pretty well since I was with the manager, but the server was not very good. My friend had to get up and get our own food, drinks, etc... The gumbo was just ok, the beer was great, and the desert was tasty.

Haven Burger, wow. Needed a burger joint in this area today and this had good reviews here and on Google. We went and wow. The Haven Burger has pastrami and 1000 Islands dressing, and it was so awesome. The owner was totally rad, too. I know it costs lots for the license but a beer would've topped it off very nicely!

Wow, could I have had worse experience.  I had to ship something out of Mandalay Bay & this FedEx is conveniently located near the expo hall. I went in and waited for Javier to finish with the person in front of me, and then I asked him for a quote for my item. He gave me a quote after weighing my item and asking for the zip code. He said it would be $18 plus a $15 handling fee just to ship from there (a ridiculous price but it's FedEx in Mandalay). I agreed and he wrapped it all up to ship it. It took forever to package my item, and I had somewhere to be so I was watching the clock.  After it was on the scale ready to mail, he said it would be $45.50. This is a far cry from $18 + $15! He said he forgot some fees. I was annoyed but agreed because I already spent over half an hour waiting. I pulled out my cash and he said I had to go to another cashier to pay because he could only take credit.   I went over to another register where the Assistant Manager was ringing someone up (don't remember the employee's name but it said Assistant Manager on his badge). After ten minutes of him finishing with the man, he started retyping in all of my information. I waited patiently... then he said it would be $59.00! I was flabbergasted. I told him the quote to which I acquiesced was $45 and I was unhappy.   Javier by this point had disappeared into the back (never even thanking me for coming in), and I made the manager go get him to figure out what was the difference in price. Javier came out and they made up some bull&*$#! fees that put it at $59. I told the manager I wanted to only pay what i was quoted and he told me that not possible. That I had to pay $59.00 and there was nothing he was going to do to help me.  I was livid but I had to get the box out that day and had no time. I am prepared to not ship with FedEx again if we're raped by companies like this. I expect people to stand by their promises and my quote was too expensive as it was but I kept getting further shafted by FedEx. I was not even trying to ship overnight... this was three day shipping. The package had better get there when they said it will.   Stay far far away from this FedEX.

My girlfriend has been going to a massage therapist in Scottsdale for a few years and suggested I give it a try. I have never had a massage in my life and I was very nervous, but I was willing to give it a shot. The price was right, and I had my first massage this past week. I was booked with Megan, the owner, for Wednesday after work.  The website was easy to use and looked very professional. The three therapists on there had brief bios that made sense to me. I was very surprised by other reviews who seem to not know the difference between Rene and Renee. HE even says in his bio that HE is a MAN. (To clarify this, perhaps a head shot of each employee with his or her bio be used.) I snagged the address and map from the website and found it quickly near the edge of Old Town Scottsdale near Olive Garden.   The business is small. If you expect some huge salon place, go elsewhere. Tranquil Massage is for the personal, small business touch so missing in today's consumer market. There is a similar business that shares some office space, but everyone was very nice and it was very calm.  I entered the front office where I was met by Megan who asked me to fill out a simple form detailing my health history (just the basics) and any meds I may be on. Then she led me into a smaller, clean room with a heated massage table, crisp, clean sheets and tranquil, quiet music playing. There were no outside sounds from other rooms or the road. Megan was very professional and went over the sheet with me before and explained, in detail, what would happen during my massage.  She stepped out before I disrobed and got into position on the table. She came back in after a few minutes and began working on my body in the manner she explained beforehand. The music played lightly, some instrumental and with vocals, I could not hear the street noise or anyone outside of the room, and Megan and I chatted through the hour I was on the table for my Swedish Massage.  She was very personable and friendly.   Afterward, she explained that I needed to drink lots of water and that I should take a few minutes to relax before dressing. She excused herself at that point.  A few minutes later I went out to the lobby where she gave me a sealed bottle of cold water to drink. Another massage therapist, Rene, came through the door. I was introduced to him, and he seemed very nice, too. I confirmed my next appointment time and left.   I did read all of the other reviews on this page recently, and I was floored by some of the negativity. One person had written that she'd never been there, but she had the gall to leave a review. I think that's against Yelp's policy. That reviewer said she didn't like Megan's responses to reviews, so I read them closely. I saw a professional, small business owner directly addressing every single concern every reviewer had on Yelp. Yes, this is a small business. I think there are four employees. It's in a shared space, too. Yes, Rene is a man. It says that in several places on the webpage. The online appointment system clearly has the information including address (I love online email reminders!).   Tranquil Massage was wonderful, and I will be back in a few weeks for my next massage.

Needed to kill two hours on a Friday afternoon and knew I could not go wrong with a Native NewYorker. Three things appeal to me when coming to one of these franchised restaurants: wifi, beer and wings.  I needed to work (I teach online) and there wifi was spotty at best. First 10 minutes were great and then nothing. Just spun and would not connect. I even told my serve who just shrugged and acted like my needs were not important.  I asked my server what IPAs were on tap and she looked at me like I was speaking Klingon. She had absolutely NO idea what I was saying. I finally had to convince her to go to the bar and write down everything on tap (not only for me but also for the next poor bloke who wanted a drink that evening!). I ordered what she promised to be a Sierra Nevada IPA but definitely tasted like no IPA I ever had before in my entire life (and that's saying a lot). I would've sent it back but she would've been confused even more.  When I got to Native's I like the wings boneless since I am usually doing a work dinner and need clean hands for my laptop. I got my usual honey hot which had absolutely no kick to them and tasted a little like soggy cardboard. Not good at all.  I watched the manager walk around and greet almost every single table around me, but never came over. Ever. I wanted to call him over and tell him my concerns, but I wasn't sure where to start & I just wanted to choke down the cardboard, chug my flat acid and get the hell out of there.

Came here a few weeks ago with my wife & 6 year old. We sat in the "box" which is a cool little side room and had the Lobster Bisque (WONDERFUL!), great local brews (SanTan Brewery!), and the baked Mac & Cheese, which is so wonderful. It was a little loud as the other person said but what do you expect?   I've been back twice since. I started coming here Sunday mornings at 8am to work. They have really fast free wifi (I use to go across the street to Murphy's Law but they've gotten so bad over there!). The breakfasts are just ok. My heart attack had runny eggs when I wanted them well but that's just my thing. The waitresses are awesome. Janeen is a dream and Danielle's been cool. There's two others who I don't know their names... The owner/manager men are really cool. Comped a drink when the price was wrong, put the game on I wanted, and even turned on the sound for MY game (Murphy's Law and RT OSullivan's always refuses to do that!).   [Sure hope they open this early in the spring on Sundays!!!]  I come now, the manager greets me, I get local SanTan drinks, and order the Mac&Cheese. I choose a smaller table out of the main area because I literally will sit there and grade/work for 5+ hours. They're good to their own. Prices may be a little higher than others but  you pay for what you get. Keep it coming!   My only gripe might be is that Eric Stoltz (co-owner) hasn't shown up to sign an autograph & have a beer with me :)

Went here on a Wednesday two weeks ago and left my credit card by accident. Called Thursday and was headed out of town so I asked if the manager would hold it until Monday. He said he would and that was fine.  I work in Queen Creek and drove the 40 miles into downtown Phoenix after work on Monday and skipped a meeting for my own child. I got there, and Robin the GM told me Danny, her assistant manager, had taken the cards to Chase Bank Friday morning to shred them all, including mine. I was MAD.  I spent gas money to get there and Danny assured me he'd hold it for me. I had to cancel all of my online transactions, too.  Robin the GM said it was Danny's fault, asked for my cell # and promised he'd call to fix it. It is TWO WEEKS LATER now and no call... ever. I am not happy. A comped meal to make up for gas money would've been nice, atleast.  Had Robin the GM known that I have the ear of the people who run Phoenix Comicon that brings over 6,000 customers into the area, perhaps Danny would've called me back. They now have the chance to lose a lot more business. People need to be fair to each other. It was my fault I forgot the card but they promised to keep it til Monday and then later promised to fix it - they did neither.

I am here a lot for shows as part of work and we've tried Cocina twice now for burritos before the concerts. I heard they rock. The pork one is just ok. That's not my problem, though. My problem is the first time they forgot my friend's quesadilla. Then they forgot it again.  It was an hour before she got it, and we were all done with everything. They comped her but seriously, it's cheese and tortilla.  This week (Wednesday night) I gave Cocina another shot. Two of us this time. I ordered the pork no onions and it had onions. The waitress sent it back and then (after awhile) the cook brought out a chicken no onion. He immediately realized it was wrong again. By this time the opening band started and I had to get in there to cover the show. Finally the waitress brought me my burrito inside of Crescent an hour after I ordered. By now I had a few beers and wasn't hungry. It wasn't good either.   Kitty the waitress seems cool and claims it's not her fault. First time said it was the kitchen. Second time said there were new changes in the kitchen. I don't want  excuses, I want great service.

Recently my child and I were driving around looking for a meal when we saw this place next to Thai Basil. She's 1/4 Polish and I have eastern European ancestry, so we immediately started drooling. It was 5:30 and didn't realize they closed at 6pm. The very nice young lady behind the counter told me we'd be fine, so we ordered. She had two types of pierogi and I had pierogi and stuffed cabbage sampler with pork. OMG it was DELICIOUS! So good. I read another review that said stuff was cold or not tasty, but I have no idea why. These were tasty (not like spicy like Mexican stuff people expect around here), and everything is freshly made so obviously hot. I didn't mind the paper plates but the plastic knives were really flimsy. If you're going to have throw away utensils, pick a studier brand.

When Thai Cuisine was remodeling in the city, this opened. Wow. Way closer to my parent's house and so yummy. I am a stickler for Pad Thai. This one was pretty good. I would've liked more peanuts and there was no fresh cut limes (just juice). But the thai tea was fabulous as was the black sticky rice for desert.   Between June 15-June 16, 2013, they're on vacation so I hope you don't try to come then.

This is a cool little joint off Roosevelt Row. It's small which makes it quaint but also small so the seats fill quickly ... you also don't want to sit by window when the sun's going down. Mariah is totes rad as a barista and the owner's cool, too. I'd like to pay a little less but can't complain for quality. Toddy's good & so is the spiced chai. During First Fridays, this is the place to stop for a drink and maybe some awesome art.

I was here recently for an event. We had the beer and pretzels. I did not have dinner.   The back patio was so awesome here. The owner was out there for our event and was very friendly. The pretzels were so awesome and the sauce, that I'd go back for them.   I got the San Tan Count Hopula  (sp?) which I loved but when I asked for a second one, it was NOT the same beer. I was very disappointed. I sent it back.  She brought another back and swore it was the Count Hopula but I know that beer. It wasn't. She was adamant. I was disappointed. Pretzels and ambience is 4 stars, waitress and bad beer not so much.

I have a love hate relationship with this place. It's tough to write a review of that.   It's the closest place to my place of work that's open before 7am so it has that. I like The Coffee Shop at Agritopia because they're cheaper and yummier but I gotta be at work by 7am. Ugh. So here I go.  I will tell you the couple that owns this place are VERY VERY NICE. I like that. I like the looks of the inside, but there's no one there ever. That's sad. But they're nice. The God vibe (lots of church people go here) isn't overpowering for people who don't dig that.  But here are the flaws. There's a barista guy who has dark hair and a goatee who doesn't welcome customers. Twice in a week I went in and was #2 in line. He ignored me. Then people came in behind me and he literally took them before me! I was furious. I've since seen him again and he seems to try to be nice now, but it was very annoying.  Now I have tried 6 drinks in here since July, and I don't like any of them. The pre-med is a good idea but there's a weird taste to it. Ice Mocha, Toddy, everything, has a weird taste. I will keep coming back SEARCHING for a yummy something. I have never eaten here though. Also, costs too much money.

Ok, I'm back. Looks like things have gotten way better. I enjoy stopping here now. That barista isn't there anymore and their toddy is tasty. I can get a 32oz iced toddy and a great blueberry muffin for $6. The usual barista now is great and the business has matured. Try it out today.

What a cool place. Love this place. Want good beer, go here. They have like 50 on tap all of the time and the service staff knows their stuff (they get a "shift beer" when they work, even). I like their outside area but they need to enforce the no smoking. Inside I always sit at the high tables.   Their pork burger is to die for. We love their PB&J and their pizza is to die for. The only thing I hate is their ketchup, which is like homemade crushed tomatoes. Yuck.  I'd go more if their WIFI was stronger. I have to sit near the bathrooms to get a good connection. The staff promises they're trying to fix this. Also, please please make a huge north facing sign so more people know you're there.  If you are lost, find Film Bar. They're across the street.

The chef, Jared Lordon, has worked for some swanky resorts up and down the east coast, so when I heard he was opening The Allegheny Smokehouse in his hometown I jumped at the chance to eat his meat. Currently the Smokehouse is limited to kielbassi and bacon and while I didn't have the bacon, I hear it's thick and meaty. The kielbassi is different than the store bought stuff for sure. It's natural casing held together a smoky wonder. It's drier than some sausage but that just demonstrates the lack of fatty fillers. I've had it smoked and au natural, heated and cooled, and it was all good. The Allegheny Smokehouse can only get better as it grows.

Seems like a legit place, but it was expensive. The lady working there was nice enough, and my dad had ordered my daughter flowers for her birthday via the phone. They made it up and it was really nice, but $100 for a vase with flowers and cake pops seemed like a lot of money.

Originally Last Exit Live existed in a small Tempe shopping center and bands like Gin Blossoms, Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers, and The Format had played there. The venue shuttered years ago only to reopen in central Phoenix mere blocks south of Chase Field in March 2013. While the Last Exit Live named lived on through co-owner's, Brannon's, booking live music through the valley, it was finally time to reopen the Last Exit Live venue. This time it was central Phoenix and is the perfect venue for 150~ people in the old Ruby Room warehouse. Last Exit Live forwent a full liquor license to pump more money into the sound system to create the perfect mid-level music venue in Phoenix. Between a near perfect sound system and awesome light system, with a beer and wine license and food trucks on the weekends, this is the place to be. Last Exit Live has changed the game for Arizona music.

Scottsdale is dumb. McDowell Mountain Music Festival use to be in Scottsdale and by the time it was relegated to a Petsmart Parking Lot, it was time to move on. This year the festival was held downtown at a local park and has become one of the best music festivals metro Phoenix has ever seen. The three day festival had a different undefined theme daily and fell on spring break. Bands like Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes have played the festival for years. Check out a reasonably priced, fabulous festival worth every penny.

My battery in my Toyota last evening died at an event. I got it jumped & it died again. Then I got it jumped a third time and drove DIRECTLY to O' Reilly's near my home. Ray was outside running a test on someone else's vehicle, so then he came over and tested my battery. It failed. He uninstalled it & took it inside to check it on the bigger machine. It failed. Ray said I needed a new one and showed me all of the options. I was surprised by how reasonable they were priced & they had a $25 rebate, too. I had a new car battery, installed, and out the door in 15 minutes. Ray was really cool, talked to me like a real person, made easy small talk, and installed my new battery quickly. I was really impressed with this place and it's my go to basic auto place now.

This place is awesome. My mother has raved about this place for a long time, so off we went. I've been there three times. The first time Emily made me an awesome mocha while Robin was perfect. Then the next day two other ladies were there. Today I went back. There was one lady working. She was way less friendly than the other four. I assume her name starts with an "A" given the signature of my frequent flyer card. She seemed off put because there was a line of maybe 4 people. I do plan to go back this week and hope it's awesome again.

IHOP is barely a step up from Denny's in terms of boring chain food. Last night was the first time I ever had dinner there, and it tasted like squishy, mushy cardboard. The food took forever even though there were only three tables in the place with customers.  The reason I gave it two stars instead of you is because the breakfasts are pretty good. I don't mind them except the omlettes which are way too oily. The coffee is almost bad, but the waitresses always look happy.  [update April 2, 2011]  Why'd I go back? I hate this place now. We went today for the first time we have all had a chance to go out together for breakfast. I was excited to do this and was eager. I should've stayed home.  My wife got a waffle with her combo that was cold, tasted like cardboard, and was crunchy. The bacon my wife and child ordered was burnt, crispy and did not look like bacon at all.  My sausage (I always upgrade to turkey sausage since the regular pork kid here is vomit worth) was totally cold. I sent it back and complained. I think she microwaved my plate.   Their coffee is always burnt so I got an iced coffee. She said they had Mocha, Vanilla, or Hazelnut. I asked if they just had a regular coffee flavored one... she said yes, and brought me disgusting hazelnut (glad I'm not allergic!!)  Ok now it's three hours later. My daughter laid on the floor whining about how bad her stomach hurts, I've been to the bathroom twice and my wife is asleep because she said if she didn't lay down, she would puke. Seriously.  The management (district managers) really need to care enough to read YELP.  They remodeled the outside of this place and, I guess, spent all their money to make it look pretty so we'd forget they serve dogfood.

First met the Pizza people outside of Last Exit Live in their food truck a few months ago, so when they opened a restaurant I was over the moon. We had an opportunity to go there this past weekend, and oh boy! So yummy. I was between two specialty pizzas but they don't make 50/50s for them, so I picked the testosteroni one & added feta. The pizzas are single people pizzas. My lady had some veggie thing she loves & the kid had a make your own (she loves places that let her choose her own toppings!). Got local craft beers, piping hot pizza from the brick oven, and fantastic service from a local female business owner.  Go here. Support local businesses!

Oooh that was worth it. I got the taco platter which had three different meats, corn tortilla, and all the fixin's. Make sure to ask for white magic with it. My daughter had garbanzo bean soup that was a little bland but nothing some hot sauce didn't fix. They were pretty busy & it took a while to get moving but then food & drink came quickly. The retro 70s vibe and look were great, and we loved the patio.

So, today's is my daughter's 11th birthday. She's been here before with her mother and asked me to take her. I agreed because the menu looked pretty good and I was prepared to take wherever she wanted to go. It's in a building near Chandler Mall that I recall being several different restaurants over the years. The ambiance was pretty good when we arrived and it reminded me of a KEG Restaurant. We got seated pretty quickly and my kid excitedly told the waiter it was her birthday. He just kinda looked at her and then asked me if I wanted a drink. I was not excited about the lack of craft and local brews but he said they also had one SanTan brew. He also said they had other bottle types in the back. I asked if he had an IPA. He said he didn't think so & just stared at me for a good minute rather than suggesting he'd go check or anything. By now I was pretty uncomfortable and just ordered the SanTan. We got our order taken pretty quickly. She got the Salmon. I got the ribs & buffalo tenders w/ broccoli cheese casserole that I heard was good.   Food came. The tenders were moist but buffalo sauce was sparse. I had to ask for more. Ribs were fine but not falling off the bone like the waiter suggested. The broccoli casserole came in the smallest bowl I've ever seen. It was half empty and crunchy on the top. I took one bite with the spoon & it was half gone. It was also warm at best. Ugh. There wasn't even enough to send back.  So we finished our food & I snuck away to ask the waiter if they had a birthday dessert. He said they didn't so I ordered the fudge cake. I asked if they have a candle. He said they don't. I asked if they sing or anything for a kid's birthday. He acted like I was crazy. I went back to my table shaking my head. He brought out the cake a little while later (it's huge and is clearly for 5 people!!). We ate what we could and then asked for a box and our check.   I got the check and was really surprised that the dessert was charged on there. Seriously? I was disappointed, but we already ate part. Then I saw the bill, & they had suggested tips on it. 22% tip? WTF. There was no way. And then I noticed that was WITH tax. Since when does anyone tip on tax? Come on! I tipped 14% and promise to never go to this place again.

I really wanted to like this place. My child and I were in the neighborhood & she was jonesing for some pulled pork bbq, so I came to Yelp. This place is right off the 51 near where we were and had high stars. It is very small & parking is in the back. Even my 9 year old was concerned since it wasn't much to look at but hey  Yelp seemed to think it was ok. So in we went.  It is very very small. Two men were inside watching the game. They thought I wanted take out but we wanted to be served. They seemed to be scramble to make that happen. The tables didn't seem very clean. We ordered lemonade & sweet tea, which were overly sweet.  My kid really wanted pulled pork BBQ so she ordered a sandwhich. It came with a side so she got coleslaw. I ordered a two meat platter with potato salad and mac & cheese. After 10 minutes the guy came back and said the pork wasn't cooked yet. I was very confused since usually that meat slow cooks for a really long time. So my kid changed her order to brisket, which I also ordered. The brisket was really chewy and didn't fall apart. My ribs were really good but a little too salty. My kid loved her sandwich, but they didn't bring her coleslaw. She had to go ask for it from them. The potato salad was runny as if it were copped into a bowl with water. The mac & cheese was good, though.  I ordered some hot links to go. When I ate them later that evening they were thinly sliced instead of full links and were like you'd find at Circle K. Quality was just bad.  When I went to pay the credit card machine did not work. I was about ready to just tell them I had no cash but I'm not that kinda guy. I happened to have $40 in my wallet so I paid in cash & left. I won't be back.

This place is by my house and a huge bowl of pho is $7.  They're great people, and I can eat there or take home. I'll get take out and heat it at home when I'm hungry. I don't care that it has gone through names and owners, it is still yummy. My kid and I get the thinly sliced beef & I add chile sauce to mine. She asks for extra veggies, and now that I'm writing this I'm hungry. Gotta go so I can go get some pho right now.

My friend and I went the second week they were open on a Monday around 4pm. We hoped they had food but don't. They were very cool about people bringing in food & said on busy weekends they'll have food trucks outside. We hoped to drink Fresh Squeezed but they were out. The waitress suggested half and half Not Your Dad's Rootbeer and the Coffee Stout they had. We were intrigued, tried it, and we were hooked! We each had three of them over the course of the evening. We sat at the bar & chatted while watching Footloose & Gremlins on the TV screens, and we also played from "Free play" arcade games. (For now, free, but I'm sure they'll charge sometime.). We had a great four hours here before we moved on to grab some dinner. I will be back soon.
