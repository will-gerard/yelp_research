Quaint buildings pretty good food. Little petting zoo for the kids. The show was ok. Not the best but no where near the worst. Only complaint my party had was the lack of adult beverage at dinner. They close the saloon when dinner starts and you get a choice of lemonade, coffee, or water for dinner. I guess keeping in the authentic dinner.

I went there due to severe pain in my stomach.  They took x-rays and blood tests and hooked me up to an IV because I was dehydrated. 30 minutes later they unhooked the IV and said there's nothing wrong you are being released. I got probably 10% of the IV fluid that I'm certain 100% of it will be on my bill. Later my own doctor showed I was severely depleted of potassium and my blood pressure was higher than normal. I've actually never gone to the hospital and left without a discussion of my potassium levels and supplementation.  A week later the pain is twice as bad and a CT scan shows two large cysts and a gallstone. I have no insurance yet the ER was empty of patients so why was the care so rushed and devoid of any effort?

This is one of my favorite places. I have never had a dish that I haven't liked. It's great to have a place that you don't have to change so many items just to make it healthy. Wonderful food great staff.

We went there with a very large group. Usually that causes problems because we all want separate checks.  The waitress was great and handled all of it on her own. The food came out fast and was very good. One person had requested no cheese on her sandwich. There was cheese.  It was taken back and fixed very quickly. The owner himself brought it over and apologized for the mix-ups. Very good service and good food.
