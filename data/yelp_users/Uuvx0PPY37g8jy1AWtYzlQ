Took my mother here for her birthday dinner. Had a party of 8. Great atmosphere and our server was amazing. We will be back.

Where do I begin?  This place has excellent food, great happy hour, and most importantly an amazing staff. Happy hour runs until 7pm during the week. Sunday's carne asada brunch is AMAZING!  Not to mention is comes with a complementary Bloody Mary.  The food, drinks, and staff keeps us coming back.

Disappointed. I purchased the groupon and when you purchase it gives you four separate coupons for 6 dollars. My two boys and I put our yogurt on the counter. And was told I could only use 1 $6 coupon with the order. I tried to explain I purchased all together. She told me I could only use one and if I used more that would be like her giving me free yogurt????  What??? I purchased the groupon. $14 later I decided I'll let the other three groupons expire.

Service staff is super friendly and food is always great. Love the Bloody Mary bar on Sundays. One suggestion is to carry an IPA on draft.

We had several craft brews and the waitress had a ton of knowledge. Great draft beer selection. Ordered the burger.......amazing. It came with the garlic fries. Location is terrible, never would have found this place without yelp. Thank you yelp, we will be back!!!

Went on a road bike ride with my wife and had to find a bike shop. Luckily this place was right next to it. Had a couple draft wines and ordered the deviled eggs. AWESOME. Cool relaxing atmosphere, we sat outside. Service was great, we will return.

This was the worst customer service I've ever received. My wife and I frequent several restaurants and bars. Our friends had a marriage reception at San Tan brewing (which we absolutely love) and everyone wanted to know where to go after hours. So we had cocktails and dealt with the rudest manager (don't swing the lights). My wife complained and her manager was even worse. He made the statement that he will always side with his employees over his customers.   NEVER GOING BACK.
