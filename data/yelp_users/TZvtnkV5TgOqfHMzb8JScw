Alladin at Artful tailoring was fantastic.  He was completely focused while i was there and gave me his undivided attention.  He listened to what type of suit I wanted and then displayed fabrics too many to count.  Luckily he is very knowledgable and helped me pick the right fabric the design of my suit.  He also did not get side tracked when other customers in the store, rather he politely told them that he was busy (with me) and that it might be a while before he could assist them.  Finding a great tailor is a lost art.  I would highly recommend visiting Artful Tailoring for all your custom clothing needs.  I'm saving my pennies now for a bespoke.  Thank you again!

Called in the 800 customer service number and after a 20 minute telephone conversation regarding my mortgage statement and payment, I was (accidently) hung up on.  I had to call in and explain myself to someone new.  Without going into the details, the Nationstar rep told me incorrect information regarding my loan and failed to resolve my concern to my satisfaction.  After 25 minutes, I asked to speak with his supervisor.  After being on hold for 10 minutes, "Chris" helped me and he was very polite and understanding.  By this time, I was very irritated but "Chris" listened to me and resolved it to my satisfaction.

Called for roses for my fiance's birthday and they were delivered at her office on her birthday.  The roses were in a nice vase and accented with baby's breathe.  A really great value for the price and the girl who took my order over the telephone was polite.  I highly recommend them.

Our hot water heater sprung a leak and caused a mess.  I found Scott on Yelp and called him at 7:00 in the evening.  He gave me a quote over the telephone which was 50% less than Benjamin Franklin quoted and was able to come out the next day.   He showed up on time and worked quickly.  There were no hidden fees.  I would refer Scott to anyone needing a plumber.

Tony stopped by today and repaired a half dozen door dings on my BMW.  I emailed him some pictures and he gave me a quote.  He was prompt and polite and I will call him again the next time I need dents repaired.

in regards to the service department, Mark Ostaszewski is polite, friendly and prompt.  I'm always personally greeted when I pull into the service bay.  Mark listens to my concerns and then provides a loaner car.  He contacts me by telephone with updates and to let me know when the car is ready.  He has been my service adviser for a Z4 and X6M..

Had the 2 for $20 meals to go.  Chose the Gyro and Chicken Skewers.  You get a hummus, salad, entre and pita.  The food was hot and tasted good.  The restaurant is clean and the service friendly.  I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick bite to eat.  I wish they gave you more than 1 pita though, make sure you order an extra (if not 2).  Thank you Pita Heaven
