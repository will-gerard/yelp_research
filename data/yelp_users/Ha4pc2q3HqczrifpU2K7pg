LGO never fails me.  It is absolutely my favorite place to have brekkie.    It is a tradition to head to LGO when I am in Phx visiting KD. Simply said, I would not leave satisfied if we didn't go. Today I was able to introduce my friend Mike S to this favorite of mine. I do believe he left this fine establishment as a fan.  Other friends joined us today and the majority of the table had a commuter sandwich.  It is the BEST breakfast sandwich on the planet.  It consists of an English muffin (made at LGO), eggs, tomato and mayo.  My meat of choice on the commuter is bacon.  This sandwich is addictive!   The best thing about LGO is that you cannot go wrong with anything you order.  You will leave happier (impossible not to). I have been to LGO too many times to count but each time I leave, I 'm one happy camper!  Mike and I were waiting for our food, looking at the other items that were ready and thinking that everything looked scrumptious.  On days that the commuter has not been my choice, I have had the french pancakes (delicious) or the fruit (always so nice and fresh).  LGO has a fun atmosphere and a cute store to wander around in while you wait.  I would be amiss if I didn't mention their iced tea.  I always have the standard iced tea but I know people also greatly enjoy their iced green tea.  I started with the iced tea and as much as I love green tea, I can't move beyond the regular iced tea.  I also appreciate being able to get a refill before I exit.   Also, I always marvel at the sweet treats from Tammy Coe in the display cases by the register. On occasion, I bring some back to Tucson to share. Love love love LGO!!

Time for an update on one of my favorite Phoenix places to eat, grab a bottle of vino or a clever gift!   This last trip I did two out of the three!  I had a delicious lunch and grabbed some gifts.  I have to say that if I owned a restaurant, it would be just like LGO.  I love this place and am always happy to be in LGO, whether perusing the wine or the groovy items in the store.  I am the MOST happy when I am eating some yummy food.  For years, I have been mildly obsessed (my friends will know I am underplaying my obsession) with the commuter sandwich.  It is so very good.  Pretty much perfection. The delicious English muffin, the eggs, bacon, tomato and mayo.  It rocks my world!   This trip, I tried something new (gasp!).  I was also so happy I did and will now have some debating to do when I am having a bite to eat at LGO.  This time I had the brown rice bowl.  I was opting for something on the healthy side.  This dish was some seriously tasty ingredients combined in a bowl.  Such great flavor!  As usual, I look forward to my next trip to Phoenix and my visit to LGO!

I've been a fan of LGO for years and yet had never been to Postino's.  On this trip to Phoenix, my friend J thought it was a must to experience Postino! We arrived around 8pm and thought it best to use the valet.  We were so happy that we were able to get a table.  Postino's is absolutely darling.  Our server recommended an earthy red wine that J took advantage of and loved.  I had the sparkling Sauvignon Blanc (delightful!) and our friend R had Framboise.  This is a wine and beer place, so those hoping for other spirits are out of luck.  For those that love wine... this is an excellent place to spend some quality time.  Fabulous wine selection!   As for the food... we were happy with everything we ordered except one thing, which I will save for the end of my review.  Postino regulars recommend the bruschetta and everyone seems to have a different favorite.  This is a fun food to order because you are able to choose 4 of the selections.  Fun decision to make with so many great selections!  My top two faves were 1. bacon, arugula and tomatoes (loved this combo!) and 2. warm artichoke spread (excellent!).  R + J loved the prosciutto w/figs and mascarpone.  So highlight of our night was the fun and delicious bruschetta! We also shared olives (meh) and the prosciutto panini.  I enjoyed the panini but my dining partners were crazy about it.   The best and worst of the night were our desserts.  We couldn't decide which one to order, so we got two.  One rocked our world and the other was ho-hum.  The Creme Brulee was the BEST Creme Brulee I have tasted.  Beyond words delish!  The Chocolate Bouchon was not noteworthy.  As my friend Beti would say, "It wasn't worth the calories."   I may have mentioned the word "fun" a few times in this review but that is such a perfect description of Postino.  If I lived in Phoenix, you would positively catch me here on a Monday or Tuesday night for their amazing $20 house bottle of wine and bruschetta special.  Oh and the Creme Brulee!

I will start this review off by stating that I am not one that goes to a lot of sports bars.  However, with football games to watch last Saturday, it seemed like a fun idea.  Highly enjoyed Gallagher's!  I had a fantastic beer on draft for $2.50.  Hard to beat that price!  Then I ordered the smoked meat platter with pulled pork (BBQ sauce).  It came with two sides and there were many great ones to choose from.  I decided on the sweet potato fries and the BBQ beans.  Really loved their BBQ sauce and would order the meat platter again.  The true highlight was their spicy BBQ beans.  They were so flavorful! The only person that makes beans comparable is my mom. My mom's are the BEST but Gallagher's comes in 2nd place.  Service was prompt and there are lots of TV's so it makes it very easy to watch a game and enjoy your meal.  If I lived in Phoenix, I would make Gallagher's my favorite sports bar.

Very disappointing.  Had to go to Phx for a training and arrived later than expected last night and HUNGRY.  Our hotel was super close to RL and we were excited to get dinner.  I'm not sure if the fact that we arrived at 8pm explains how lacking the food was... or if I'm just trying to find an excuse for RL and how bad the food was.  L and I have been fans of Red Lobster for years.  We don't often get there but when we do, we are all set with our regular order of the popcorn shrimp.  Our server was very quick to get the food out,  which seems like a good thing but was also ready for us to leave ASAP.  I'm a bit confused by this because the restaurant is open until 10 and we left by 9:15.   Back to the food. Generally, I love those warm biscuits that are absolutely terrible for you. Last night, I only had one because it was neither  warm or tasty.  The salad was meh.  The popcorn shrimp was on the cold side and the fries were not terrible but were very salty.  The salty fries may have been my favorite thing and that is just plain sad.  Decided to go all out and have a specialty drink, which was really nothing special.  i ordered the Malibu Hurricane and it sure wasn't anything to excitedly Yelp about!   Red Lobster does an excellent job of tempting you with yummy looking commercials and endless shrimp for $15.99 but the reality doesn't come close to expectations.

I had heard of Craftsman Court from a friend but had no idea that it would be as phenomenal as it was.  I was completely impressed with the the selection and sales staff.  The store is much bigger than I had guessed and it took me some time to work my way through it.  Fantastic tiles and creative designs for whatever room you are seeking to tile or add some pizazz through tile to.  I have many ideas for projects I would like to see happen in my condo.  Phoenix folks are lucky to have Craftsman Court because I am not aware of anywhere that would compete with this store.

I finally tried Ethiopian food!  Blue Nile Cafe is a groovy little restaurant in Tempe.  My friend JR and I sat in the back room, which was very quaint.  I was able to try six of the dishes, due to the fact that you are able to add two sides to your plate.  My main dish was the Tikil Gomen ($6.99), which is a flavorful cabbage and potatoes dish! JR enjoyed the Blue Nile Tebb ($8.99), which is a beef dish with onion and green chili. Loved the fact that I could try so many dishes by us strategically not ordering the same side dishes.  My two favorite sides were- Kik Alitcha (delicious pureed yellow split peas) and Kik Misir Watt (red lentils with Ethiopian spices).  Very reasonably priced and excellent service.  I am excited for my next trip to the Blue Nile Cafe!

Lux. You rock! My friend Michael describes Lux as being "an experience". Here is the skinny, it is the coolest coffee shop I have ever been to, so I would say that Lux is an excellent experience!  It was almost a week ago that my friend Jess took me to Lux and I am still geeking out over it.   I loved my coffee, my berry cornmeal muffin, the chocolate chip cookie (with salt on top) that my neighbor let me try, the drink selection, the ambiance, the DJ in the corner playing the cool music, etc. etc.  Groovy things about Lux--  You will love it the minute you walk in. I don't believe in love at first sight... but love at first entrance to Lux?  It happened.  They roast amazing coffees. So a good old- fashioned cup of coffee tastes Delicious. How much is that big beautiful cafe going to cost you?  $2. Are there free refills?  YES!  That is off the rocker cool!!  I have a local favorite coffee shop in Tucson and are my refills free?  Nope. The selection of quality coffee drinks and breakfast treats is still on my mind.  I also am thrilled that they offer soy milk, almond milk and organic milk.  Almond milk is my milk of choice. I wish every coffee shop had almond milk.  I'm so over soy.  So if I was to have an iced chai at Lux, I could pay an extra .50 and have my almond milk. Next time I am at Lux, which will be on my next Phoenix trip... I am having one of those iced mochas that I saw so many peeps drinking.  They put a dollop of cream in the mochas... I can't wait to have my own!  Cannot get over how rad Lux is!

I found Joe's Real BBQ while visiting friends in Gilbert.  One word for Joe's is- GREAT.  It was great BBQ!  The line out the door was a huge indicator that I was going to be a fan of Joe's.  Thankfully, my friend had called our order in, so we went to the pick-up window outside.  I had the regular BBQ sandwich with one side ($6.99). You are able to add an extra side for another $1 but I would not have been able to finish a 2nd side.  I decided to have the chopped brisket for my sandwich and the BBQ pit beans for my side.  The brisket sandwich was delicious!  I would absolutely recommend this sandwich.  The beans were okay.  I would pick a different side next time. I ordered a kid's sandwich meal for my son ($4.49).  Great deal! The homemade root beer was yummy!  If I had seen their desserts, there is no question that I would've had to have something.  So many good choices! Apple crisp...sweet potato pie...root beer cake, etc.  I will save room for dessert next time!

St Francis has become a favorite Phoenix restaurant choice.  If I had to pick a last meal, it would be the baked goat cheese appetizer.  Seriously.  I would want the whole thing to myself with a glass of rosé.  I have had their kale salad... LOVE, not like this salad.  Last night ,they didn't have kale salad on the menu (seasonal)  so I had the mixed green salad (beets, goat cheese, pistachios) and that was a nice runner up. The croutons in the salad were so good that even a non-crouton fan like myself, was oohing and ahhing.  I also had the pumpkin soup, which was fabulous!  This restaurant is absolutely darling.  I enjoy sitting outside on the patio or inside... both have a different vibe but both are equally charming.  Service has always been outstanding.  I've heard rave reviews about the burger and may one day need to try it to confirm. I wish we had gotten there before Happy Hour concluded yesterday because glasses of wine are half off and we enjoyed some vino!  Great wine list and delicious speciality cocktails!  Excited for my next trip to St Francis, since it's on my go-to list when visiting Phoenix.

When in Scottsdale... Sprinkles!!!  Their cupcakes are on my list of desserts I love.  This was a great trip to Sprinkles because there wasn't a long line.  Sometimes when I'm in Scottsdale and want one, there is a line out the door (very worth the wait).  A favorite of mine is the vanilla milk chocolate... OH MY YUMMY!  The frosting is so damn good.  This was my long standing favorite but my new love is the chocolate coconut.  My friend had a peanut butter chip.  She was not a fan.  It was seriously peanut buttery (peanut butter cake with peanut butter frosting).  However, the peanut butter chocolate is a great choice.  Why?  Because it has the delicious milk chocolate cream cheese frosting!  Also, if you are a true cupcake lover, you may enjoy the banana cupcake for breakfast.  I've been known to indulge myself with this on a Scottsdale trip. It's like delicious frosted banana bread.  So much better than a donut!!

Happy to have had some great brekkie at Over Easy.  My friends and I hopped on our bikes and rode to Over Easy.  We had a 20-25 minute wait when we arrived so we grabbed a coffee at the coffee shop, a couple of stores over.  The hostess was accurate with how long the wait would be.  The service was good.  Our server seemed quite serious but she caught our joy after a few minutes at our table.  Service was good and our food was great.  D had his eggs, over easy of course!  He also had the blueberry pancakes, which we all sampled and found to be dense.  I like my pancakes light and fluffy... these were not.  L had an omelette, that she described as "delicious".  You're able to create your own omelette, with 3 ingredients of your liking.  I was very tempted to create my own too but instead decided on The Mediterranean.  I loved my omelette, which had lots of flavor!  If you are not a fan of garlic, you will not be a fan of this particular omelette!  The hashbrowns were also very good.  I would absolutely order this meal again. Over Easy has a fun vibe and lots of great choices on their menu.  They also have a nice selection of healthy choices too.  I look forward to my next trip to Over Easy... I might get their fancy iced coffee with cinnamon & cardamom, sweetened condensed milk & mint. YUM!

I am about to start gushing about a grocery store.  Friends of mine that live in Phoenix had told me great things about Fresh & Easy.  However,  I don't usually make a practice of stopping at grocery stores while visiting Phx. What brought me to making a stop this time was a fantastic wine that my friend KD introduced me to.  This sparkling red wine from F & E was so enjoyable that I made the stop on my way back to T-town.   I walked in the door of this groovy little market and I will have to say it was love at first glance.  I was walking down the produce aisle and it was a beautiful sight! I really thought I was only going to buy the wine and be on my way, but thats not quite the reality of the story.  I started pondering what I could bring back to Tucson that would stay fresh sans a cooler.  That meant I could not purchase the chipotle ranch dressing that looked super yum.  I picked up some produce because their tomatoes were too beautiful to not purchase.  Stopped at the sample table and met Mary, who had raspberries with crème fraiche and they were lovely!  I did some purchasing of trail mix (great selection), cereal bars, veggies and wine.  Their wine selection was super fun to discover.  I bought two bottles for a grand total of $11.  That is pretty darn phenomenal!  I left Fresh & Easy blissed out and will come prepared with a cooler on my next jaunt to Phoenix.

I was visting Phoenix for the night and having dinner with my friend who lives in Arcadia.  I loved the look of this restaurant, which is very cool but left unimpressed with the food.  It was hoppin' on a Wednesday night and we luckily grabbed the only two open seats at the inside bar.  I had eyed someone's salad and immediately thought that is what I will be ordering.   We started off with drinks.  I really liked the creativity with their drink menu. KD had the midnight shandy ($9.5) which she enjoyed.  Shandies are an interesting concept, incorporating beer and booze. It was so hot out that a nice light white wine sounded good to me.  I went with the vino di tavola- white.  A nice pinot grigio ($5).   We had the grilled summer squash ($7) for our starter.  There are yellow raisins included in a major way on this squash.  Raisins are not my thing and it's not mentioned on the menu about the raisins  but it was a tasty app.  I would've never gotten it though, had I been aware that raisins were in my near future.  I attempted to talk KD into splitting that salad I spied with me and also sharing the ricotta gnocchi but she did not take the bait.  She informed the gnocchi is very good but she wasn't in the mood for a heavy meal.  I ordered the casa salad ($8) and KD ordered the pork belly($12). The pork belly was very fatty so I passed on having a bite.  My casa salad was dreadful.  I was super duper disappointed.  It had burnt grilled bread on top.  When this was pointed out to our server, she had another plate of grilled bread brought out to us.  The salad had a strong, unappealing flavor.  Perhaps it was simply an off night for the house salad?  I love salads and Fox restaurants have some amazing salads. This was not one of them. I love my Sam Fox restaurants as much as the next person but this one was not a highlight for me.
