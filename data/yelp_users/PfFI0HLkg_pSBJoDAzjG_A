It was a bit of a slow start, but once the food started rolling (pun intended) it was one great hit after another. We sat at the bar where Nate took great care of us. Being that this is a new establishment, I expected there to be some hiccups along the way. But there was very little. To sum it up simply, the food was spot on. The manager/ owner (I assume) was sure to come over and make sure that everything was to our liking. Which I very much appreciated. This was a fun and delicious experience. I highly recommend the yellowtail jalape√±o appetizer. Flavors of all the dishes we tried were balanced, and in my opinion tasted "decadently expensive" without the super high dollar price tag that you sometimes expect from good sushi. We also tried the signature "Osaka roll" which had a whole lobster tail, crab, eel,  and English cucumber ($20). It was well worth the price. One of the best maki rolls I've had. If you are in the Gilbert area and looking for a fantastic taste of the east, try this restaurant. I will definitely be venturing back when I am in the area. Well done Osaka!!!

This place is what central phoenix doesn't need. Keep Fox restaurants in Scottsdale. I witnessed everything from old people sharing a beer to kids running around like maniacs, and don't get me started on the douche pistols in affliction shirts. Parking sucks. Food is subpar at best. Can't tell servers from patrons...one server came to us with her purse on. Don't need this and don't want this in such a cool mecca of independent restaurants and bars. Like I said before, take this place back to Scottsdale.
