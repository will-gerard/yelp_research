Last night I felt like a kid again when my friends and I went to adults night at the museum. Some of the exhibits are very amusing and not very scientific at all but that's okay, it's for kids. Unfortunately I didn't get to ride the bike across the rope because it was closed, but maybe that's possibly because it can't handle adult weight. The sneezing display was very funny. The spinning pole display was questionable but maybe I have my mind in the gutter.

Kudos to the bartender last night who delivered superior customer service! I forgot her name, but she went above and beyond, and she deserves lots of praise. (If it helps you identify her, she had brown hair in a ponytail and wore glasses.) The little things she did for me made an overall outstanding impression. She was fast and paid attention to detail.

Good service! My locksmith was quick, professional, and friendly. He also charged me a fair price. I'll call them again if I need their services.

I've always loved this place. The service is great. I treat myself every once in a while to the cookies and cream frap. Way better than Starbucks. Beware of the pesto chicken wrap. It has lots of black olives in it.

Thank you for being the experts at dentistry! Drs. Okun and Okun are professionals and I've had 5 star service each time! The staff is also great. Earlier today I had my wisdom teeth extraction done by Dr. Cedric Loud. Dr. Cedric Loud and his team handled me with great care, despite the fact that I was fidgety and emotional. Thank you so much. I will definitely recommend this office to friends! I will return to this office if I ever move back to the Valley!

I am copying a small part of the letter I wrote to Basha's in a personal email, but leaving out some details:   I had a 5 star experience tonight when I shopped your #48 store on 1751 E. Warner Road in Tempe, AZ. I rushed home as soon as my shopping trip was over, just so I could type this letter to you. I work in retail and was raised by a family that owns a business, so I know a spectacular business when I see it.   Charles the Pharmacist deserves every ounce of recognition you can give him. Estevan (or Esteban) from the deli and Diane the cashier were also helpful, respectful, quick, and kind with their service.   Ever since moving to the Valley, I have had some trouble finding the right grocery store for me. After visiting what seems to be every grocery store in the Phoenix Metro area, (and I am very picky about my grocery stores) it is safe to say your store is the best grocery store in Arizona.   The inviting new store design, ease of access to products, reasonable prices, and incredible customer service make this business worth visiting again, even though it is slightly out of my way.

Today I went back for a redo to get more layers. They did a great job and I am happy.

I ordered the breakfast grilled cheese sandwich. It was delicious. Big enough to split, since I don't eat big breakfasts. For a breakfast place, I was kind of expecting a bigger menu. However, I'm not that let down since I liked what I ate. I really like that there is alcohol here for a day I might come back with friends for mimosas with brunch.

You don't even know, girlfriend. This place was delicious enough to get me into a good mood after another long day at work. People were looking at me funny but I was smiling cheek to cheek while eating this entire meal. I completely indulged. I had the half chicken with green beans and cornbread stuffing. The chicken was juicy. The cornbread stuffing had a good consistency. The sauce was a little bit sweet and perfectly complemented the savory chicken. The Chardonnay went well with my meal. The bananas foster flamb√© with rum cake was a great indulgence and enough to share. The service was impeccable!

The massage was just as good as any other massage. The customer service, ambiance, and amenities are what puts this spa over the top. The key to great customer service is anticipating the needs of your customers before they even ask for them. That's where they really stood out.

The food was good as usual. Get the Shepard's Pie with carrots. Wash it down with a glass of cider. You'll thank me later.

I love the atmosphere in this place. Makes me really feel like I'm in paradise. Ordered the small plate of fish tacos for happy hour and they were so good that I ordered them again. Fish was cooked perfectly and the creamy slaw on top was refreshing and a tad bit acidic. I will be coming back to order these again and possibly the plantains as well.

I'm impressed with the staff here. They seem to be very hard working. The food just wasn't good. It was edible, but not good.

The food was delicious. I had the penne with chicken and prosciutto. It came with a nice cream sauce. I tried my date's gluten free pasta, and it was great. The only thing I didn't care for was the weird looks I was getting from the wait staff. It was unsettling.

It was really good. I ate the pasta. It was a little on the salty side, but other than that I liked it. It was creamy and the noodles tasted fresh. The service was quick. I like the decor.

The Big Bang is a great venue for people who aren't fans of the traditional bar scene. I would much rather spend a few hours with a couple of friends in this welcoming and non- threatening atmosphere than at a bar where strangers get in my personal space and dance too close to me. The staff is very attentive, helpful, and appear to be happy with their jobs. Josh always makes me feel welcome and is always extra friendly to me. The drinks are never watered down and the bathroom is always clean. The songs get kind of repetitive and the music is all pretty karaoke, but who cares when you're out with friends having a good time?! The only critique is a lack of available good seating. This place needs to expand the seating and make it easier to view from the upper level. If they took out the staircase or the elevator and opened up the area, it would be much more inviting, especially on busier nights. "Sweet Caroline," "Benny and the Jets," and "That Old Time Rock and Roll" are their 3 fallback songs they seem to play if they are not getting good requests they know how to play, so come with fresh ideas!

Pretty darn good steak tacos. I was pleasantly surprised since I'm not a fan of Mexican food, and the Irish pub next door seemed more enticing. It was interesting to see the tortillas being made and I was pleasantly surprised that they were crunchy- not soft. I'm glad I can pick what to put in my tacos because I am a very picky eater. I wish the items weren't a la carte, though. The line was super long but it went by very fast.

I wish I could give this a five star review, but the drink pick- up counter had ants on it today.

This was pretty bad. First the hostess was put off by us. She didn't understand that we wanted to have a table for dinner. Then the server didn't understand our order. She also forgot to bring out our diet coke. The placemats didn't look clean. I don't know if it was the kitchen's fault or the server's fault but we got our entrees before our appetizers. The birthday song was really obnoxious a few tables over because they pulled out a big drum that was way too noisy. (Honestly nobody likes the birthday song except the people in your party at your table. Restaurants should stop doing it completely. A more special birthday present would be either a discount or a free dessert without the song.) Finally, some of the meat on my plate was undercooked and some of it was partially burnt. It looked like there was only one server for a huge section, and I felt bad for her.

The lettuce from the salad is frozen, even after ten minutes of not touching it. The chicken is a little dry. The rice is either over cooked or reheated leftovers. The rug in the front entrance is filthy. The chairs are full of dust. I realize this is just mall food but I'm a big believer in Yelp and telling the truth.

I wish I had gotten my hair done here years ago. In this business, you really get what you pay for. I love their service, and products. Join the pure privilege club. Your hair will thank you.

Good job Travis! Thank you for being so quick and thorough with your service. You are a good communicator. Both you and your partner did what you said you were going to do. I will hire you again if I need your services. You offered a better price than  your competitors. The service was delivered to me with a sincere smile and handshake, and that speaks volumes.

I love DB! I am consistently served great tasting coffee with superior customer service!  I have no complaints. I was already in love with DB, and then I saw the special on Undercover Boss, and it confirmed my appreciation for this business. Had I known about this company when I was in high school, I would have worked for them!

My representative at the auto glass center, Dovid, was super helpful. We spent less than ten minutes talking on the phone and it was hassle free with my insurance company. He was able to accommodate my busy schedule and send his glass installer out to my vehicle when it was convenient to me. Dovid said that the installer would come by anytime between 12 and 3 and the guy came out at 12:00 on the dot. Kudos to the whole team on a job well done! I'm looking forward to seeing my movie!

Kim Brush has a wonderful little shop! Her store is fun, her selection is delicious! The customer service is five star quality! I am so lucky to work close to her store and get in when I can. I think they would generate more business if they were open late on the weekends. Today I bought the dark chocolate sea salt caramel flavor popcorn and a Herbert's Strawberry lemonade. Yum!! Makes a great gift.

Perfection! Well worth the money and generous tip! I have a very short, curvy body and it is often times hard for me to shop for the right clothing. I definitely was long overdue for some alterations. They took what seemed like an impossible task and made me feel fit for my clothing. A nice added touch was the fact that Gemma remembered my name when I came back for my pickup.

This place deserves only one star for doing my pants correctly but treating me like crap. I will not be back. Their shop is also filthy. If you want to be belittled because you have a couple of pounds to shed, or because you are younger than their average customer, this is the place for you.

Good restaurant. I'm taking away one star because the rice was served to me in a to- go box, which is weird. I ate the Qwik Special Chicken and it was like a deep fried chicken nugget with sauce on it. Nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't out-of-this world amazing either. I will be back if I'm in the area.

Ate the Mexican Pho and it was delicious. It tastes like this has been slow cooking for many hours. I also really liked the plating. Service was good. The Passionfruit sangria is pretty strong. Just one is enough. :)

This was either the best or the worst night to throw a birthday party. The bar wasn't anticipating the arrival of 700 Santa Clauses when I booked my reservation. That being said, they were as accommodating as they could be in that situation. Plus, I got to have an epic dance battle with a guy dressed up in pink tights, a sweatband, and a tank top that said "Olivia- Let's get physical".

Matt D. was my sales associate for the Presidents' Day sale and he did a great job by being honest, quick, and polite with his service. He also made sure I got what I wanted by asking the right questions. His upbeat personality makes the chore of picking out a bed much less of a chore and more like a fun time hanging out with a buddy! If I didn't already have a job and I had the capability to lift mattresses, I would definitely want to be on the sales floor with him. The delivery team was quick and I thought it was funny that I had to initial the form to confirm that I got my mints.

Food is great. Service is great. Music is great. Location is great. Decor is great. I have been to their restaurants many times. I am always treated wonderfully when I go in. It's flattering to have a respectfully flirtatious waiter serving me each time I go in, even though I know they just flirt for tips. I do not know what people are complaining about, the service is always great. I believe in treating others with respect and kindness in order to get served the way you want, so maybe that's why I've never had a bad experience. The owner was in the front of the house tonight, so I felt like I met a celebrity when I told him I love his restaurant. I think it's good that he sees the FOH operations and can manage his staff that way. I think they should open a Tucson location. I am slightly envious of Lo- Lo's business, and I wish he could mentor me.
