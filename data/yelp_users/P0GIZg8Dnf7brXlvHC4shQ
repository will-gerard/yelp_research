I come here every day sometimes several times a day but only within the last few weeks this "24/7" gas station is being closed almost every night between 2 am and I don't know when frankly because I never stick around to find out. Not seeing any other vehicles here other than other customers who's business they're losing (6 people with in the  last  5 minutes to 10 minutes or so) I wonder if the store owner knows his business is being closed for so long every night? Other than that I love this place and I'll change my review to 5 stars to reflect that once this issue has been Resolved.

They have some really awesome lines of beauty products carried at this store that are great quality and I have yet to find them in other CVS stores or even Walgreens for that matter. I was digging the whole place. Very clean, parking lot is beautiful. I didn't think I'd ever think of a parking lot as beautiful.   But then I needed something. And had to ask an employee. That's where I went wrong. Had I never interacted with the  staff I would've found my new favorite CVS For my lonely insomniac 2am shopping trips. Nay. Not one, not two or three. But each one of the FIVE female employees I had the displeasure of getting close to was flat out RUDE to me.     Now you say, "Taylor, you must be paranoid and insecure from being a chubby teen." Yes. You're right, but this is NOT my imagination, they are literally shit-talking me in the aisle next to me talking about my clothing, hair, makeup, tattoos. Yes, girls  I know it is Scottsdale but I can't be in pageant makeup 24/7.   I asked one girl who seemed nice enough if she knew if a sample was available for a perfume I was wanting to smell. She glaced quickly and said "doesn't look like it". Ooookkkaayy. "Do you think you could open one for me to smell? I guess If not that's fine."  She just says "okay thanks". And leaves.   They're all concentrated in the makeup and beauty side of the store all gossiping and giggling with each other like it's lunch hour. Genuinely perturbed that I would interrupt their discussion of who their friend is sleeping with (they use a different word lol)   There's one with long dark hair who just answers any question I have or saying "excuse me" with the DIRTIEST sideways glare, LIKE DIRTY SANCHEZ DIRTY, never actually bothering to face me directly. Following this with extended periods of silence, then a one word answer dripping with pure hate.  Another huffs and puffs, rolling her eyes and I guess doesn't know to let someone through when they say pardon me and between to wedge themselves between the aisle shelves and miss Huffy herself.   I swear I have never felt this way since freshman year of high school in north Scottsdale. I transferred to a Phoenix school for sophomore. Oh wait, they're on their phones again and found this review now. Leaving before I get jumped.

I have taken my used jewelry to other buyers before. My less-than-stellar experiences with the others left me a bit skeptical and very cautious in who I trust with my jewelry. One of "Jim's" competitors tried to tell me my white gold, diamond, and sapphire necklace was essentially worthless junk, and That I should take their $30 dollars, as that would be my best offer.  It seemed some of their other Customers had come across their jewelry in less than honest manner, and they were reliant upon the customers willingness to accept next to nothing for their jewelry. I did not do business with them that day and I never will, but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth regarding jewelry resale.    Diamond Jim rectified this, since the moment I walked in I was put at ease by their friendliness and professionalism. Jim's shop is on the small side, but it is CLEAN and space is well-utilized (i.e. Display cases weren't crammed full of unnecessary crap, this can be so overwhelming.) Staff members were openly talking to each other and customers, no hushed whispers to each other, or snobbish formality, which had always made me uncomfortable in other shops. Everyone warmly greeted my boyfriend and I, asked how I could be helped, and directed me to take a seat when I was ready.   Marsha  got us started while we waited for someone to appraise my piece. She is an absolute joy, knowledgeable on her product, the kind of person you feel like you've known a lifetime.  She was just so patient with me, pulling out everything I asked without the least bit of frustration. (There were a lot!) She made some suggestions but never pressured me, answering every question I had.   They have a huge selection at Diamond Jim's, there is something there for everyone. High-end pieces, turquoise and Native American jewelry, and excellent quality lower-end pieces. I fell in love with a vintage red ring, it was immediately polished on-site for me. They had such a great trade-in policy in place, I had to take advantage of it.   The necklace I had mentioned before was appraised by the shop owner, Ron. He tested the gems and gave me a very fair price. In addition to the trade-in deal they offer, I couldn't have asked for anything more. He wrote a check right then and offered to cash it for me as well. They aren't looking to make the 300-400% retail mark-up I've found near-everywhere else I have gone. These are honest and up front people, their profit relying on their incredible customer service to create return customers. Ron's and the shop's "story" as a family owned and operated business certainly resonates with me, as the daughter of small-business owners, I love to see the  "little guy" make it against the corporate giants.   Diamond Jim's is not a some sleazy pawn shop for unsavory characters, and it's not a  hoitty-toitty overpriced, stiffly formal national chain either. They are finally a jewelry shop where I feel I will be treated fairly and with good old-fashioned care and consideration as any business should operate. I've already sent someone over to them. The shop's atmosphere makes me feel like I'm visiting old friends, literally, such a hidden-gem. Stop in, you wont go anywhere else after working with Diamond Jim's.

Umm are all y'all reviewing the same place as I am? Sound system/ sound man was whack, microphone shorts, and he couldn't give a shit frankly.  Bar tender was giving everyone attitude all night. Wish it was just "another chick paranoia" but even my single guy friends said she was belittling them for ordering a beer. & wearing this strange outfit of tube socks, daisy dukes, an ill-fitting cut up t-shirt, backwards trucker hat? She seems very confused. Very.  I was sworn at for handing her tip at the end of the night. That's good.   The only good thing LEL had going for it last night was the door man, Chris! This guy is the shit! A real gentleman to everyone, Incredibly accommodating and kind, shame he has to work with people with such bad attitudes.

Stopped in tonight with my boyfriend and we can't stop talking about what a great experience we had! Jessica and Adam were helpful, friendly and knowledgable. More than accommodating, and went out of their way to make us feel like we have a friend in the business. As a newbie to vapes, I was worried I might get oversold by a salesperson but they immediately put me at ease. Jessica was very patient with letting us try whatever flavors we wanted and making great recommendations. Adam was very friendly and honest with us. Even though this shop is across town from me, I can't wait to come back because of the selection available and incredible customer service. See you guys soon!
