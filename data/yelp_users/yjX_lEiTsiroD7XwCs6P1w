I got a pretty good deal for 3 nights here when I flew out for my friend's wedding. But after checking-in, that is where the good times stopped. The staff were meek-mannered and not very helpful when I asked to received the 10% discount for Checking-In; they said since I checked in through a different site I couldn't receive the discount. My room had windows but they were high up, no view to speak of, and the only ice machine was on the first floor near the vending. The carpet was old looking and coffee left something to be desired.   The only good thing was that the local delivery pizza was able to deliver to our room, so we didn't have to go downstairs to get it!   I wouldn't stay here again.

I love that you can gamble right when you step off the plane! I love that there is a flow to this airport, pretty easy to find your way to shuttles or taxi cabs to get where your going. There are plenty of little shops everywhere and a handful of Starbucks to get your caffeine fix, which I needed on my last trip since I landed at 8am!

I'm not a huge fan of Nike other then for workout gear and running shoes but this place was huge!!! A group of friends and I visited the outlets one lazy weekend day and this place caught my eye. The pricing was wonderful and the selection was vast, if I didn't have to fly back to San Francisco with just my small carry-on suitcase I think I would have bought a new pair of running shoes!

I like the Silverton Casino, it was close to a friend's house we were staying at and not on the strip. It's huge inside and a ton of machines and tables. I had a good time playing the slots but I feel my next visit will be better cause I'll bring more money! Drinks are a great price and you get free drinks playing the tables and slots. I wanted to buy a drink at the bar cause I was done gambling but it was 1am and the bars inside were closed! Not quite sure why but oh well.   Will return and look forward to the visit!

If I could afford it, I would buy a penthouse here and be totally happy! It's so beautiful and even the floors in the gardens are exquisite. Parking was easy to find and it's free. Check in looked a bit crazy but it was UFC weekend, it was being held at Mandalay Bay,

I really enjoyed watching baseball here during the A's Spring Training. I sat in Section D mostly and the view was amazing and the shade was much needed. I liked the beer garden with the picnic tables and the chicken taco stand was very delicious. The ushers were very helpful when we needed to find our seats initially and seemed to know the couple who we sat next to for all of the games; I later learned that they come every year and sit in the same spot!   The only downside, and it's not even that bad, is this place is cash only. They provide ATMS but the service charge is $3.95/transaction. That adds up if you forget to bring cash all the time and there isn't a close by place to get cash back at near the stadium.  I would love to visit this stadium again but, sadly, not for the Oakland A's Spring Training in 2015 since they are moving to Mesa.   Great place all around and a good variety of adult beverages. Perfect for the family to come and watch America's past time.

This place is literally HUGE!!!! I was visiting a friend for a long weekend about 2 weeks ago and hit up the strip on the weekend. It's really nice on the inisde and the staff helped my boyfriend and I find the Pinks Hot Dogs that was suppose to be at PH. FYI it's on the outside! Next time I'm in Vegas I will be staying here!

I came here back in February for the first time, my friend who lives out here said we all had to try it. They serve nothing but chicken fingers, I'm serious, just chicken fingers. I was hesitant to try the Cane Sauce (I heard more about the Sauce then the chicken from my friends) and I am very glad I tried it, it's amaze-balls!!!! I have to come to Raising Cane's whenever I visit Las Vegas, it's a must no matter what my plans are.

I came here back in March (A's Spring Training!) with my boyfriend to meet up with some friends who live in the area. It was easy to find and I loved that it wasn't too crazy when we were there. They still had happy hour going on so we grabbed a couple drinks and some bites. Our friends are regulars here and seemed to know exactly what to try! Fun music and friendly staff. I would love to return here and maybe sit outside next time!

I love Starbucks! Especially when there is one inside of the hotel I'm staying at, even more after $10 all you can drink at the bar! They are quick and friendly, and they don't ask why your wearing sunnies inside the hotel, I think they just figure I am hung over. I love that they have seating inside and items you can buy like normal Starbucks. I will come back for my caffeine fix next time I'm staying at the hotel.

I wanted to grab something quick while we waited to board our flight home to California and this was the only place that looked decent in our terminal. The seating area was packed with people and their luggage but I table opened up and we snagged it. I got in line to get our food and was handed a menu. There were a lot of options but it was mainly different combinations of the same thing. I ended up ordered a BLT, which took forever to make. and a breakfast burrito, which was the quickest. If Peets was closer to us (we were dead tired from Spring Training) then I would have just gone there and spent less money for better coffee and breakfast.   The BLT had a lot of avocado and bacon on it but it was not worth $9+ and the breakfast burrito, from what my boyfriend said, was okay.   I don't think I'd go back to this place unless it was the only option.
