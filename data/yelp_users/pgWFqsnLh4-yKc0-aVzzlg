I love Majerle's for what it is: a good times sports bar. I go there to enjoy sports related events, with sports minded people, easy bar food, and flowing beer.  They have a pretty extensive menu, and the food is good not great, but I didn't come here expecting a gourmet dining experience with the Cards game blasting in the background, so you shouldn't either.  What you should expect lots of beer, libations, fun people, and good service.  Double bonus for having a lot of tv's that are easy to see :)  If you're looking for a fun downtown bar to watch your favorite sporting event at, then I'd say alley-oop your way over to Majerle's!

This is my favorite place to come for breakfast!!  It's a small restaurant, but the quality of the food in the morning is outstanding.  Upon sitting down, you are immediately greeted with the most delicious croissants and jam in town.  They are so light, flaky and buttery that the scream french bistro!  Plus, the breakfast entrees are extremely affordable and tasty.  My favorites are the eggs florentine and any of the quiches.  And I don't want to give away too many secrets, but prepare yourself for a nice surprise following your meal.  That is as much as I am at liberty to say ;)  Top notch and I can't wait to go back!

When I'm looking for something fast but not crazy unhealthy, I love to grab something from Rubio's. It satisfies my Mexican food craving, without being too greasy (a.k.a the guilt).  My favorites are the California Bowl (all the deliciousness from inside the burrito but without the tortilla) and the Gourmet Tacos (all meat options have bacon in them....need I say more?).  Plus, the salsa bar is always stocked and the place is always clean.  Rubio's is definitely fast food done right!

I have a total love-hate relationship with Einstein's.    Love: fresh bagels, good cream cheese, and solid bagel sandwich offerings. Hate: the staff that works here.    Last time I came in I ordered my standard Santa Fe Turkey Breakfast sandwiches to go.  The girl at the counter argued with me with the type of bagel it was to go on (1. I thought you always had a choice in bagel, and 2. I'm pretty sure I've ordered this sandwich more times than I care to count; I know what's what).  She said that it was supposed to be on an Everything Bagel, and I wanted it on an Asiago (the bagel it's slated to go on).  She then had the gall to ask if I even knew what I was ordering.  I politely smiled, and said I know what I'm asking for so please give me my order as I have asked for it.  She checked me out, I took my sandwiches home, and lo and behold my sandwiches were on an Everything bagel; not the Asiago like I've asked.  Whammy.  This is just an isolated incident from the staff here.  I think every time I come something goes awry with the staff.  I keep coming back because the breakfast is quick and tasty, however someone needs to start training the employees on proper customer service.  4 stars for the food; 1 star for the service.

If you love bruschetta and wine, then you must come down to Postino's to dine!!  Postino's is one of those staple restaurant-wine bars in the Arcadia area that you come to enjoy casual yet delicious food, and an amazingly chic-cool atmosphere.  All the bruschetta's are delicious (my fave is the prosciutto fig), and their wine options are phenomenal.  The most fun is to come at 8pm on a Monday or Tuesday night when they have their board and bottle special ($20...a total steal!), but be prepared to wait as it can get pretty packed for that event.    They also serve brunch on the weekends, and to be able to sit out on the patio on a beautiful winters day (thank you AZ sunshine!) for a morning meal is always an amazing bonus.  If you're in the mood to get your carbs on with some bubbles or wine, definitely come and check out Postino's!!

I came in with no expectations, and thank goodness because I got just about that.  There are no windows so the place is dark, small and claustrophobic feeling.  One of the female bartenders seemed pretty friendly, while the other one was not helpful at all.  There is a pool table for 50 cents a pop which is nice, and drinks are crazy cheap which is great, but the atmosphere makes you feel like this is a place where rainbows and dreams go to die.  I love dive bars, but this is way too dour of a place for me.

Char's Has the Blues is so much fun!!  The Motown band that plays on Saturday nights is absolutely killer.  The only problem is that everything is a little small. The dance floor, bar, and bathrooms are itty bitty.  But, the atmosphere is fantastic, drinks are inexpensive, and the dancing shoes are a flutter so I definitely recommend heading out to Char's for an evening upbeat fun!

If you are a foodie, then you MUST come and check out Atlas Bistro!!  To start, the restaurant is small.  There are only 10 tables in the entire place, and it is attached to a wine store (which is convenient since it's BYOB).  But the small space just adds to the intimacy and the experience.  The food that comes out of the kitchen here is like beautiful artwork.  The plating of the meals are absolutely stunning!  It's the type of stuff that you only expect to see at super fine dining restaurants in NYC, LA, London....Our eyes enjoyed the food without even tasting it.  And getting to the taste, every detail on the plate has a purpose and a distinct flavor.  All the ingredients are fresh, upscale, and unlike anything you would get at any other restaurant in the Valley.  We dined for restaurant week, so had the pleasure of tasting their many different dishes.  The 2 things that stuck out to me the most were the pork duo with tomatillo sauce (the sauce was heavenly), and the duck breast.  Now, I've eaten duck breast before, but never one like this.  It was cooked beautifully and you could cut through it like a perfectly cooked filet.  I ate every bite of that duck, and if they keep any duck items on their menu, I am going back just to see what other exciting things they do with it.  Our overall experience was unlike any other at Atlas Bistro, and I am looking forward to enjoying many other foodie friendly dining adventures there in the future.

I always get excited when we're having date night at Chelsea's Kitchen.  It never disappoints, and Saturday night was no exception.  We started off with the deviled eggs appetizer, and believe me, it is 100% worth adding in the bacon!!  The filling on the eggs tasted absolutely delicious and adding in the bacon bits put it over-the-top tasty.  I could definitely eat a whole batch of these on my own.  After that we had the brussel sprouts salad (more bacon into our meal, which is always A+ for me), and the green chili burger.  Oh. My. God.  The burger itself was amazing, but the FRIES!!!  Holy cow, the fries were insanely good.  This was my 1st time ever tasting them, and I am going to have to order them on the side every time from now on.  They are a seasoned fry, and the seasoning has this spicy-sweet tone to it.  So so yummy.    Atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the staff are attentive and knowledgeable.  I definitely recommend popping in for a meal at Chelsea's Kitchen when you're in the Arcadia area :)

Sad to have to write this review, but after today's fiasco, I cannot imagine eating here again.    I went in to order a few things to go.  A green monster wrap (for my vegetarian friend), and a scoop of chicken salad with a bowl of chicken poblano chowder for myself.  I thought the chowder sounded amazing, but I love having something solid to eat too, so thought a scoop of chicken salad would suffice that craving.  I placed my order, and after them having some problems figuring out how to charge for the chicken salad, they finally inputted my order and I took the food back to the office.  So, imagine my surprise when we open everything up: NO CHICKEN SALAD.  Boo!!  Super upset, but at least I still have my soup.  Whoops, take that back!  My soup was practically inedible!!  It tasted like a straight salt lick, it was so salty (and I'm an extra salt girl, for me to think it was salty....it was SALTY!).  In fact, it was so salty that my tongue was burning (and still is as I write this review) so I could only eat a few bites of it before I had to throw it away and go back out to get lunch from elsewhere.  After that debauchery, I don't think I can trust going back there for lunch, which is too bad since it's a convenient drive from my work.  And for those of you who are wondering, according to my vegetarian friend, her wrap "was soggy".  Not the best description or indicator that she'll go back either.  Sad sad day indeed...

I love coming to Crust!  The atmosphere and the food are super homey and comforting.  I recommend the spinach dip (comes out piping hot and cheesy from the woodfire oven) and The Meat (pepperoni and sauge) rustica.  YUM!!  Also, I am super obsessed with their marinara sauce!!  Luckily, they sell it by the jar so I can take a little of their Italian magic home with me. :)

I've had mixed experiences at the Breadfruit & Rum Bar before, but this last one has pushed me to the "maybe come for drinks, but definitely not food" category.  The problem is the service and the speed at which the food comes out.  Now, I understand if the restaurant is busy that it may take the kitchen a little longer to get the orders out, but to wait 1.5 hours before ANY food hits the table is beyond ridiculous.  The waitress never kept us abreast as to what the hold up was, and we had to hunt her down in order to find out what happened to our order.  When we finally got to her, she went and checked with the kitchen and said it'd be 10 more minutes. More than 20 minutes later, the food came.  This situation could have easily been handled by a) letting us know that the kitchen was very backed up, and b) offering to bring us something to eat in the interim.  Neither of those things happened, so we were left twiddling our thumbs in hunger for waaaaay too long.  By the time the food finally arrived, everyone was a bit cranky, so the joy of the atmosphere had been spoiled.  It's really too bad because the food (once you actually get it) is actually quite good.  We had the guava pork belly, red curry shrimp, and jerk pork and all were quite delicious.  Same goes for the drinks.  If you're a rum fan, and particularly a Caribbean rum fan, then you will absolutely love the cocktail menu.  They even serve a rum punch of the day, which the bartenders change daily, so that is always fun.  I wish we had had a better service experience at the Breadfruit, but alas it was not to be had, and without a beach view to distract me from the unnecessarily long wait for food, this has pushed me overboard and is probably the final time we visit the island food at the Rum Bar.

Bartender here was RUDE!!!!  I asked the bartender for something simple; to make me a Shirley Temple with a shot of vodka in it.  He told me that he had never heard of that drink before so he would not make it.  I asked him if he heard of a Shirley Temple, he said yes.  I asked if he's heard of vodka, he said yes.  So I said, fantastic, then please put those 2 things together for my cocktail.  He flat out said no, he would not make it for me.  I took my group of 12 and left.  Will never go back with that type of service.

For clean eating, I love coming to True Food's!  It's a open, friendly atmosphere with a ton of healthy eating options that are flavorful and tasty.  Their salad staple is the Tuscan Kale salad, which is full of crisp kale greens, sprinkled with parmesean cheese and a lemon spiced dressing.  Really fresh tasting and super delicious!  My other favorite salad (when it's in season) is the Roasted Vegetable Ingredient salad.  Roasted veggies (think califlower, squash, brussel sprouts), pomegranate seeds and mulberry with a horseradish dressing.  It is absolutely SUPERB!!  My only issue with it was that for some reason this time the salad was about half the size it used to be.  I mean, I don't normally eat a ton, but this was so tiny that I was still pretty hungry after.  Not sure if they changed the portion size, or if they were running out of ingredients, but for $12 I expect to be satiated.  Overall, I love the quality of the ingredients at True Foods and will definitely be coming back to get my healthy eating on :)

I'm disappointed to have to write this review. I've been to the Tuck Shop several times, and have always had great experiences in the past.  However, I just tried to make a reservation for my dad's birthday, and they wanted me to PRE-PAY $20 PER PERSON, PLUS 20% GRATUITY, PLUS TAX.  Are they insane?!?!  To make a reservation at your restaurant for 4 people, you're asking me to pay you $102 and some change just to come through the door?  I see that you will apply this to my bill, however what if we don't spend $20/person, or if my service is horrible and I don't find a 20% tip appropriate?  In all my travels (NY, LA, London, Italy.....) I have NEVER had a restaurant ask to be paid ahead of time, just to hold the seats.  That, my friends, is the definition of insanity; and I don't feel like going to the asylum.  Hasta la vista Tuck Shop.

I absolutely love going to the Parlor; especially at happy hour.  Luckily, they have happy hour every day (weekends included yay!!) from 3pm-6pm so I have plenty of chances to get down there.  During HH, they do a bunch of $5 appetizer specials, as well as $8 pizzas.  This is a smoking deal, and the food is on point.  My favorite appetizer is hands down the Cauliflower Gratinata.  It's a bowl full of piping hot cauliflower that has been simmering in a cheese sauce that is lick the bowl good.  Absolutely amazing.  Also, you cannot go wrong with any of the pizzas.  I think the Spicy BBQ Chicken pizza is one of the best in the Valley, so definitely check that one out.  Double bonus for the staff being friendly and helpful, and also that they use a lot of their ingredients from their onsite garden.  Nice to have a local place using fresh ingredients that they take care of.  You can taste that love in the food :)  A+++ in my books!

Tottie's is by far the most AMAZING Asian food you can get in the Valley.  I frequent Tottie's about once a week, and it never disappoints.  My favorites are the Tottie Rolls (make sure to add in the mint and cilantro they provide on the side, it makes the difference), Green Curry with chicken, and Tom Kha Gai soup.  The Tottie rolls are just unique, and are a combination of an egg roll and lettuce wrap. A definite must try.  The curry and soup are so FLAVORFUL!!  Lots of spice and aromas....mmmm......makes me hungry just thinking about it.  I've had the pleasure of both dining in and taking the food home for takeout, and I must say that both have always been easy and wonderful experiences.  If you do eat in, I recommend trying the sugarcane chicken appetizer.  It comes with a flame to give your chicken an extra grill and a to-die-for peanut sauce; definitely something to be enjoyed in the restaurant.  Plus, the ambiance is comfortable and inviting, and the staff are super friendly and knowledgeable so it is definitely worth eating in once in awhile.  Overall, A++++

For a small local coffee shop they sure are pricey!   I stopped by for a smoothie, medium coffee and breakfast sandwich and paid WAY more than I expected.  The smoothie was nothing special, similar to the level of a Jamba Juice smoothie (but half the size and cost about the same), and my breakfast sandwich was also just mediocre.  Nothing particularly wrong, but for the price that I paid I expected better quality.  I do like that they have a dog friendly patio, but at those prices my dog and I will go elsewhere.

5th and Wine is an absolutely phenomenal restaurant for food and wine!  I've been coming here for their monthly wine pairing dinners, and I have to say that I have never been disappointed.  Every month, a wine representative comes with 4-5 different wines, and the Chef at 5th and Wine creates a menu that highlights the best aspects of those wines.  Last night the representative was from Talbott, and the pairing was sensational!!  Pumpkin soup with creole lobster paired with a Chardonnay - STUNNING!  Stuffed pork tenderloin with a medium bodied Pinot Noir - FABULOUS!  And I don't normally eat dessert, but you bet your bottom dollar that I spooned up every bite of the brie and berry bread pudding (seriously, they need to add this to their full-time menu).  The atmosphere is always inviting, the staff are incredibly friendly, and the company is always pleasurable.  Looking forward to indulging in more of these pairings in the future :)

5 stars for Debbie (ask for her, she is speedy, efficient, and amazing)  4 stars for atmosphere (clean, tv's play music videos, tall cushy barstools)  Minus 1 star for the pedicure stations (no massaging chairs...may seem silly, but it's my thing), and because it seems like they struggle having a lot of staff on site at all times.  I know that they accept walk-ins, but I imagine it would be hard to walk in for an appointment when there are only 1 or 2 techs there at a time.  Also, an honorary shout out to nail tech Alla; she does my friend's nails, and if you are looking for nail art, she is the queen :)  Overall, nice clean place to get a solid, long lasting manicure.  As long as Debbie is there, I will be back!!

Working with Ben and the Sparklean Laundry team was an absolute dream!!  They assisted us in setting up bi-weekly pick-up laundry service for an employee with 7 foster children.  The laundry was always returned on-time, and came back folded and sparkling clean, which was a feat considering that we asked them to provide a large scale service so often.  Ben was easy to work with and accommodated all of our requests.  We couldn't have asked for a better set-up and are beyond appreciative of his services.  I 100% recommend using Sparklean Laundry for all of your laundry services and needs.

I love coming to Ken's!  Service is always quick, and my manis and pedis last a long time.  Plus, pricing is incredibly good (gel manicure is only $30....you can't beat that for the quality!).    They do take reservations, but you can also walk in.  I've done both, and have never waited for more than 10 minutes, even on the weekend.    Two (beautifully manicured) thumbs up!! :)

When it comes to all inclusive chiropractic care, Dr. Dom is as good as it gets!  I came to Arcadia Health and Wellness on a recommendation from a good friend of mine. She has been singing Dr. Dom's accolades for years, and she was confident that he could "fix my migraine problem".  I'll be honest, I was completely skeptical as I've had migraines for years that no other chiropractor had been able to fix.  However, because she was so emphatic about his abilities I decided that it was worth a shot and booked an appointment with him.    Lesson learned? Never doubt my friend. :)  Since beginning care with Dr. Dom and his massage staff, I am now migraine free for 4+ months and have never felt better!  Not only have my migraines dissipated, but my posture has improved, and overall I'm feeling much more balanced and strong.    Dr. Dom is AMAZING and I 100% recommend seeing him and his staff for your chiropractic care!!  Trust me; your body will thank you for it ;)

This FedEx/Kinko's location got me out of a serious bind!    My boss decided last minute that he wanted menus printed out for a dinner party he was hosting in 3 hours, and wanted them on stationary (that we didn't have), and small enough to fit on the plate.  I went to a different FedEx/Kinko's location 1st, and after sitting there for almost an hour, getting things to the size/color/etc that I wanted, they told me that they couldn't be done until the next day.  In other words, they wasted my time and I still had a task to get done.  Even though I thought I didn't have a chance in the world to get this complete, I decided to call this FedEx location to see what their wait time would be.  The associate I spoke to, Chris, said that if I came down right away he could get it done for me on time.  Needless to say, I flew down to Scottsdale Rd and Camelback, and sure enough Chris got it done for me quickly and efficiently.    I am totally indebted to the team at this location for helping me get this rushed task done with a little time to spare.  From now on, any time I have a copy/print task I will come to this FedEx/Kinko's location.

Beckett's Table is one of my neighborhood favorite go-to restaurants in the Valley.  To start, the vibe is that perfect blend of chill and hip. You walk in to see a nice size bar and "social" sharing table to your right, and to the left is a very open space with comfy tables and a gorgeous patio. Wherever you choose to sit, you're in for a great experience.  And the food, on top of it all, is stellar.  Everything tastes so fresh.  They do a deviled egg of the day, which should never be missed, and their pork osso buco is fall-off-the-bone tender.  Also, if you sit in the bar area (sharing table or bar outright) they have social hour until 6:30pm with appetizer and drinks specials.  Our favorite go-to's are the roasted beets (hot multi-colored beets w/ roasted onion and apples), and the grilled pancetta grilled cheese with a bowl of soup.  This sandwich soup combo is Ah-Mazing!!! We've tried not ordering it at social hour, but inevitable always break down because it is that delicious :)  If you're looking for good food, and a fun Arcadia atmosphere, then Beckett's Table is a solid go-to.

There are few things that make me giddy, and having thai food delivery is one of them.  Thankfully, I have SaBai Modern Thai to keep that love tank full. ;)   I live in the Arcadia area, and luckily I am in the delivery zone for their Phoenix location.  Some of our favorite dishes to have delivered are the green papaya salad (topped with 2 pieces of shrimp), pad thai (oh so saucy with chicken and shrimp), and the pad prik king (spicy dish with green beans, we order it with beef).    Thank you SaiBai for keeping my stomach full, my mouth spicy, and my Netflix churning with your tasty food and fast delivery service!!

Best cocktails and service in Scottsdale!!  I am never disappointed when I go to Citizen Public House.  The cocktails are unique and delicious (ask Thomas to make them for you, he's amazing), and the service is impeccable.  For dinner ask to sit in Sam's section; he is by far one of the most knowledgeable, on-point servers I have ever had.  All of his recommendations have always been phenomenal and he has a cadence about him that makes you feel like he is enjoying the dining experience as much as you are.  Food standouts: Chopped Salad; Scallops; and the Tenderloin Wrap Drink standout: Manhattan; trust me on this one, it's out of this world.

I ABSOLUTELY recommend shopping at Unique Vintage Chic!  Unique Vintage Chic is truly one of those hidden gems that needs to be navigated and excavated by all fashionistas.  The shop is located in the Borgata, and it is a Mecca for unique jewelry finds.  Everything in the store is vintage, restored and fantastic.  There are so many choices of bracelets, earrings, necklaces.....you get my drift.  What's wonderful is that many of the items are matched into sets, so you don't have to go all around the store trying to find your rings perfect match; it's already set next to it's perfect jeweled family.  And best of all, the pieces look really expensive but are in fact reasonably priced, which is the premium combination for my closet and my wallet.  Not only are the choices amazing, but the owner, Kathy, is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.  She can tell you give you the details on all the different styles, beads, stones, etc. and even help you match a set for any given occasion.  Kathy helped me pick out the perfect 3-piece earring/necklace/bracelet set for a charity fundraiser, and let me tell you, those pieces were the hit of the auction!  I can't wait to go back to pick up some more gorgeous and unique jewelry!

The Westin Phoenix Downtown is a fantastic hidden gem!  I had the pleasure to stay there for a girls weekend getaway, and was amazed at how beautiful the hotel was.  You walk in, and the smell reminds you of relaxing away at the spa.  The associate at the front desk was very friendly so check-in was a breeze, and we were surprised to see how gigantic our standard room was.  The room was easily double the size of most normal hotel rooms, which made us feel super relaxed and comfortable.  Plus, they are known for their beds (Heavenly collection, that funny enough you can purchase!), so sleep and comfort took control of the stay.  The other great thing is the location.  We were just a few blocks from City Center, as well as many other restaurants and bars, so it was very easy to explore the city without a car.  I would definitely book a return trip back to the Westin the next time I need a hotel downtown :)

Arcadia Farms is one of my favorite places to chat, gab and grub with good girlfriends :)  The restaurant atmosphere is similar to a ladies tea room, all warm and cozy on the inside, with a beautiful patio out back.  I personally prefer to sit out back and enjoy the lovely AZ weather, but everyone has their own preference, so either way you will not be disappointed.    Same goes for the food; every dish is like a warm embrace. Comforting, warm and so delicious that you cannot help but smile as it consumes your taste buds.  I have yet to eat anything that I have not wanted to order again.  My favorite dishes are the egg strata (breakfast), and warm vegetable salad with chicken (lunch).  The strata looks almost like a bread pudding, but is filled with eggs, cheddar cheese, roasted veggies, and sausage. Holy yum!  Double bonus for having 3 different mimosa options (orange, raspberry, or peach) and fresh baked goods!  I highly recommend dining at Arcadia Farms for a relaxing, comforting day out :)

Laura is quite simply the queen of brows!  I started getting my brows done by her almost 3 years ago, and any time I try someone new they never compare to the job Laura does.  There's a reason she calls it "brow design", because she meticulously looks at your natural brow shape, face shape, etc, and shapes your brows in a way to enhance all your natural features.  The process is quick, painless, and I always walk away happy.  Laura is officially my brow-guru, and I plan on indulging in her brow offerings for as long as time will allow :)

Dear Jimmy Johns,  Please learn how to take an order and deliver it properly to the person who requested it, then paid you and tipped you for it.  I have now ordered from you for delivery 3 times, and every time you have figured out a way to mess up the order.  Extra lettuce you ask?  That must mean you want no lettuce on your sandwich.  Right.....  Furthermore, on a personal taste level, your mayo is too sweet and I am not a huge fan of having a marshmallow aftertaste on my palate in congruence with my roast beef.    Thank you for your lack of service.  That is all.

So, after my last horrible experience, I had sworn to never order from Jimmy John's again, however as luck would have it, I had zero time to go out to grab lunch for myself, and before I knew it, it was 2pm and I was starving.  The "fastest" delivery near my work is JJ, so I sucked it up and ordered a sandwich for delivery as soon as possible.  It has now been over an hour since I ordered.....still no sandwich to be seen.  I spoke with the manager, Drake at the store TWICE now, and he has been unhelpful and has offered no alternatives to get me my order.  I suppose now the only option is to cancel my order, because obviously this sandwich has been taken on a joyride and I'm not paying for my sub to be hitting the town for a good time.  I will truly never Ever EVER go back or order from there again.  EDIT: driver just showed up with my sandwich, an 1.5 hours after I ordered it. He informed me that he had just gotten on shift 10 minutes ago, and was given the sandwich. However, the manager Drake had told me my sandwich was out for delivery more than 40 minutes ago...so I smell an even bigger rat than before.  Order was canceled, and sandwich was sent back with the driver.

I love going to Grassroots for lunch!  The atmosphere is always buzzing (they do take reservations, and I highly recommend making them) and the food is consistently good.  I like to go on Friday's in particular because they have their special Omega 3 Salmon burger that day.  Fresh salmon with arugula, avocado and aoili on a flax-seed bun with your choice of side (if they have the grilled broccoli that day it is a must order) - a super yummy lunch without the heavy guilt!  Service is also impeccable and I've yet to have a server that I didn't enjoy.  I will say though, I do get extra excited when I get to sit in Sarah's section; she's very knowledgeable about the food, incredibly upbeat, and has a great sense of humor :)  If you get a chance to sit in her section you won't be disappointed.  Can't wait to go back for another stellar lunch experience soon!!

Little Woody is a great neighborhood bar in the Arcadia area!  It's a small place, with 2 separate rooms.  One room (the main one you walk into) is your stereotypical standing bar with table, booths, etc for noshing, drinking and socializing.  The back room, though, is where the magic is.  The back room is basically an adults arcade.  There is skeeball (you can win prizes if you rock at it), shuffleboard, darts and fooseball.  It's a great way to meet new people (everyone loves a little friendly competition) and keeps the atmosphere light and amiable!    I only knocked down the place by 1-star because it can get a bit overcrowded there on the weekends, but other than that one issue, Little Woody is definitely a place I recommend to check out for a good cocktail and some fun!

The Spice It Up food truck it Dee-licious!!  They came to my building this week for our Wednesday food truck jamboree, and I must say that this is my favorite truck that has come so far.  I ordered their special Thai red-panang style curry with chicken and it was out of this world good!  There were lots of grilled vegetables and plenty of chicken above perfectly cooked basmati rice.  There was also the option to add Thai chili's to it, so being a spice fiend I definitely took advantage of that (and I am so glad I did ;) ) The sauce of the curry was creamy, spicy and oh so good.....I practically licked the carton clean it was so tasty!  A few of my friends also ordered from the truck (they got the Jamaican jerk chicken tacos, and red lentils) and they too raved about their meals!  The Spice It Up food truck gets a gold star in my book, and I truly hope they come back to our building's Wednesday food truck jamboree again!!

Came to Sol last Wednesday for the 1st time, and I must say that I was very impressed by it.  First, they give you complimentary chips (more like home baked seasoned tostadas) with fresh salsa and bean dip.  You can tell that the salsa is homemade, so it was a nice start to our meal.  We also had 2 specialty tacos (which were delicious) and the pork carnitas.  Let me tell you, the carnitas were out of this world good!  Slow roasted and oh so flavorful....I was seriously considering taking whatever man or woman made them home with me so I could have more at my disclosure!  But the main star of the night was definitely the service.  Our server, Sarah, was absolutely sensational!!  You could tell that she was busy (it was pretty packed in there), however she took the time to explain and recommend the dishes, and even gave us a brief tequila class.  I have never had a server that was so passionate about tequila before!  It made me really want to learn more about the pairings , process etc that tequila can provide, so I definitely plan to come back in order to delve into this some more. :)  Overall, good food and outstanding service!!  Can't wait to go back to enjoy the food and learn more about tequila!!

Maybe I came on an off day, but my food at Habanero's was bleh.  I mean, it was edible, but lacked flavor.  I ordered the blackened shrimp tacos and might as well had just boiled shrimp with a little blackened color.  I have friends who love this place, but based on this experience I have no inclination to go back and give it a second go.

Really cool small venue to enjoy live music!  We went to see Black Pistol Fire, and was surprised with how open and clean the place was.  Drinks are on the cheap, which is awesome, and the acoustics in the place were the perfect place to rock out.  It did take a little bit of time to get our drinks as there were only 2 bartenders, but the place wasn't that packed, and we were listening to good tunes, so it didn't matter that much.  I would definitely come back to Pub Rock Live to see another band play!!

AZ Training Lab is legit!!!  At ATL, it's quick, high intensity workouts that get you in, get you out, and get you results.    I joined the gym when they first opened, and I cannot imagine ever going anywhere else.   Since joining ATL, my body has become physically and visibly stronger.  I attribute this to the variance of the workouts, and the attentiveness of the owners/trainers.  Ben and Dave are absolutely phenomenal at getting the best out of you, in and out of the gym.  They will help you set nutritional goals in order to maximize your results, and keep you motivated in order to achieve your ultimate fitness goals.  As an added bonus, most everyone who works out there is so friendly  that there's a camaraderie within your group and you look forward to working out with them each day (shout out to my 6:30am crew!!)  I highly recommend going to ATL for your fitness future.  1st class is free, so why not check it out? ;)

I've been wanting to stop into Bink's Midtown for awhile, and I am so glad I finally got the chance to go!    We sat out on the patio, which was beautiful (fireplace and lights strung about make for a beautiful atmosphere), and enjoyed some amazing food. All of their menu items use ingredients that come from local farmers, so you know you are getting the freshest items and getting the chance to support local businesses.  We had the Green Chile Pork Pupusas (delicious!), the Purple Yams with Spanish Chorizo (holy moly), and the Niman Ranch Burger with a side of fries (came with 3 different dipping sauces; they speak my language).  I would 100% order any of these items again, and I am especially looking forward to trying more items off the menu!  We are already planning our return visit, and I have my eye on sampling the house pulled mozzarella the next go around, so don't get in my way ;)

The BF and I were craving Italian food, and came across a Living Social deal that seemed to good to not try out.  Lucky for us, it was an even better experience than we could imagine!  With the deal, we were awarded 1 appetizer, 2 entree's, 1 dessert and 2 after cocktail drinks for less than $50.  The food and service was so outstanding, that we are already planning our next trip over.  To start, our waiter, Drew, was the real deal.  He was super friendly, had great recommendations, and was incredibly knowledgeable about the food/drinks.  His service was top-notch, and made the evening that more special.  With that, we started with the acorn and burrata app (amazing), moved to the gnudi (ricotta dumplings) and maltagliata (homemade cut pasta in tomato cream sauce) - both outstanding - for dinner, then had tiramisu and homemade limoncello (a must try) to bring it to a close.  We would 100% order all of these items again.  And the biggest surprise, was I asked for a cup of coffee to sip on at the end of the meal.  This, by far, was the best cup of coffee I've had in town.  Ever.  It was their Americano, and apparently they buy their beans from a specialty European shop in Tempe.  I would go there again just to have another cup, it was seriously that good.  All in all, and amazing experience at SOLO Trattoria, and we cannot wait to go back and try more of their spectacular food!

Cool market/restaurant spot in Phoenix.  Came here on a pub crawl and I was pleased with the stopover there.  They have a full bar, which is great, and a lot of food options.  We had the Chino salad (kinda like a Chinese chicken salad) and it was super tasty!  The one thing that I couldn't get over though was that this place looks and feels a lot like LGO, but I found out they aren't connected in any way shape or form.  Not sure if they used the same interior designer or just ripped off their look and feel, but it was surreal to be there and realize I wasn't in Arcadia.  Other than that oddity, the market is casual, and has great food and drink options, so I plan to come back next time I am in downtown for lunch!

The Attic is a pretty sweet spot to go to for wings, burgers and beers.  They have a nice sized menu of unique beers (that changes often), and overall the food quality is much better than your average sports bar. Specialty burgers, pizzas and appetizers....most everything is A+.  I personally love their dry rubbed Cajun wings with the chipotle dipping sauce.  It's de-lish!  The only reason this place doesn't get a 5-star rating is because the staff here rarely smiles.  And I mean RARELY!!  Sometimes they're friendly-ish, but most of the time they just seem sapped of any sort of enthusiasm, so service drags. If the staff was a little more energetic and on-point, it could definitely get the full 5 in my book.

Mackie's Parlour is truly one of the top dog boutiques in the city!  The owners are very knowledgeable and friendly, and the store has a wide variety of pet products to choose from.  I bring my two pups here for all their doggie accessories and treats (they even make their own brand of cookies that my two go absolutely gaga for).  What's great is that they now have grooming services, and I must say that the groomer, Edwin, is phenomenal.  He went over my list of how I wanted them groomed, made some suggestions, and took them from there.  Not only did my pups look and smell fabulous after their grooming, but he was done with them ON TIME!!!  I will definitely be bringing my pups back for their next beauty day ;)

Great local shop with some of the best prices in town!  I needed to add in a pre-workout supplement for my long runs, and a friend recommended that I check out DS Sports.  She said to tell the guy who works there what I'm looking for, and he'd point me in the right direction.  I can happily say, that is exactly what happened!  He asked about my workout/run habits, and found me a pre-workout with low sugar but long release to keep me pumped up while I'm out pounding the pavement.  And, the prices for their products were by far the lowest I've seen in the Valley, so I take that all as a win-win!  I will definitely be shopping at DS Sports again for any of my sports/workout nutrition needs from here on out!

Talk about an uncomfortable experience!  We went to Nook this weekend and I think it's safe to say that this is the last time we will be visiting this establishment.  We decided to pop in for a cocktail and pizza, so we sat at the bar and had one of the owners wait on us.  By his tone and conversation, it was blatantly obvious that he did not want to be there and couldn't wait to close up and go home.  He was not friendly nor helpful and overall the whole service was really uncomfortable.  That combined with the fact that our pizza (the Giardino ) was just meh on flavor really put a big damper on the evening.    It's too bad because we've come in several times before and had decent food and service, but this experience really left us with a sour taste for all that is Nook.

The Gladly has everything I want in a restaurant: great ambiance, amazing cocktails/wine list, sensational food, and all under the umbrella of unbelievable service.  My favorite server is Kat.  Not only is she incredibly knowledgeable about the food and drink list, but she is witty, fun and makes you feel like you are all enjoying this amazing meal together.  Pair her with with the assistant manager, Lex, and you have an incredible team.  Lex is so passionate about everything The Gladly, that he could tell you every detail about how dishes are prepared, why they are done that way, how they created the new cocktail of the day....his passion is astounding. It makes you excited to see them and to hear about all the new things that have added to the menu.  And for the food and drinks, you honestly cannot go wrong in any direction.  For food, I personally love the octopus small plate (and I'm not even that big of an octo fan, but the way they prepare it is fantastic!), roasted root vegetables, the short ribs, and the tender belly pork chop.  And for drinks, hands down it's the Pan Am Sour.  I am a HUUUUUGGGE pisco sour fan (which is hard to find in the Valley) and this drink scoops up all my love for that cocktail with a twist.  It's even adorned with the signature Gladly "G" made of sprayed bitters in the middle.  It's amazing.  If there is one restaurant in the Valley that I can go to again and again for consistently amazing service and food, it is The Gladly. :) Cheers!!

Harumi Sushi is by far my new favorite place to grab sushi here in the Valley.  I went with a group of 10 people, and not one person had a bad food experience.  To start, the rice is purple.  Yes.....PURPLE!  Apparently, it is a black rice that turns purple once cooked and is filled with extra antioxidants and other components that are good for you.  And trust me, even if it wasn't good for me I'd still be asking for it.  I don't know what it is, but it is phenomenal!  The dishes we shared were the Ahi Stack, Spicy Scallop roll, and Salmon Sashimi.   Holy moly; the Ahi Stack was unlike anything I've ever eaten.  I thought it was a roll, but instead it is a mountain of ahi tuna, crab and spicy sauce on top of a mound of purple rice topped with fresh avocado and roe.  We inhaled it, and will definitely get it again.  And the salmon is the most buttery, fresh salmon I have ever had in the valley.  They top it with their homemade fresh wasabi, which was also fabulous!  I docked 1 star because when we went to pay there was a lot of confusion and some people received their bills, some didn't, some didn't get their cards back for awhile.....it was a cluster, but definitely forgivable.  If you love sushi, I definitely say run, Run, RUN to Harumi!!

I absolutely love taking my fur babies to Lori's for their grooming!  They always come back looking amazing, smelling fantastic, and smiling large.  I think the smiles are because they are a cage free grooming facility, so after my kids are all styled up, they get to hang out with all the other gorgeous pooches waiting for their fur parents.    Definitely a great place to take your dogs for all their grooming needs! Two enthusiastic paws up!! :)

Do yourself a favor, and go to Essence Bakery for some out of this world pastries!!    I normally try to skip out on the sweets (no bueno for the waistline....but so good once it hits your lips!), however anytime I have a crazy sweets craving, Essence is the place I go. If you go in the morning, I highly recommend the Almond Chocolate Croissant.  It is seriously out of this world delicious, especially when it's fresh 1st thing in the morning.    The other item I 100% recommend is trying any flavor of their macarons.  They are so light and fluffy yet packed full of flavor.  And if you can't decide on just one, you can buy mini macarons to try out a myriad of flavors.  Seriously, I'm salivating just thinking of them, they are that good!!  Two very enthusiastic thumbs (and belt notches) up for Essence! :)

Frank Food Truck parked itself outside my work today, so I decided to treat myself and see if the dogs lived up to the hype.  I have to say, the food here is pretty tasty.    The process is simple: pick your dog type (I wanted polish sausage but they were out, so went for the chicken apple sausage instead), pick your bun (brioche or pretzel) and then pick from pre-created gourmet dogs, or create your own with a variety of toppings.  I ordered the Mr. Bahn Mi-Yagi, which had Vietnamese inspired toppings.  The toppings itself were fantastic!  Lemongrass pickled carrots and daikon, fresh jalapenos, cucumbers with a sriracha aoili - what's not to love!  The only thing was that my sausage itself was pretty small.  My friend ordered an all beef dog, and his was almost twice the size of mine, so that put a small damper on things, but all in all the flavors were spot on.    I also ordered a side of their dirty chips, which come with bacon, cheese, sauteed onions and more sriacha aoili.  These were super tasty.  My only request would be to chop up the bacon more finely so I can get more bacon in more bites (they were semi large pieces, so only a few chips got the full mix of flavor experience).   With that said, 2 thumbs up for Franks franks! ;)

I had to look for a kid-friendly restaurant to dine at this weekend, but I wanted to pick a place that still had good food and atmosphere for the adults to enjoy too.  Blanco Tacos was the perfect place to have this type of meal.  The restaurant is loud and provides high chairs, so the atmosphere is perfect if you have little ones (esp. ones who like to "talk" - aka screech - a lot...but I digress...).  Plus, there is a kids menu, along with a good sized "adults" menu too.    The food came out promptly, hot and tasty!  Plus, the margaritas helped A LOT with the kid noise ;)  Definitely recommend coming here for some family friendly dining fun!

There is nothing better during Sunday Night Football than a pizza.  Because of that, Giant Rustic Pizza has become our go-to for Sunday nights.  This NY style pizza parlor has yet to serve us a mediocre pie.  Our personal favorite is the red, white and green (tomato, ricotta cheese, and spinach) and we add sausage.  It is seriously A-MAZE-ING!!  Anytime anyone says anything about pizza, we always come back to this standard.    Also, they make their salads fresh if you'd like some greens, and also do a Sunday night wings special, which I highly recommend for all you fans out there ;)  Hooray for Giant Rustic Pizza Sundays!!

I'm a makeup and skincare fanatic, so I love that Ulta carries everything I need in one shop!  Great products on hand (brand name and less expensive versions), and the store is large and well laid out.  The only problem is sometimes it is a bit difficult to find someone to help you, but if you walk around the enough you are bound to find someone who is knowledgeable and who can steer you in the right direction.  Also, I highly recommend becoming an Ulta member, as you will receive tons of coupons and sales offers throughout the year!!  Ulta is a great one-stop shop for all your "Care" (skin, hair) needs :)

5 stars for doing the impossible - getting me to eat and ENJOY olives!!  Any of my friends can tell you that I absolutely despise olives, so when the chef initially suggested that I order the smoked olives as one our appetizers I initially poo-pooed the idea.  However, she told me that she too was not usually an olive fan, but pushed me to try it because the smoking process she applies to the olives takes out a lot of the mouth puckering "oliveness" flavor and replaces it with a smokehouse-type treat.  I obliged and ordered them, fully expecting to take a bite and deem them dirt-like in flavor.  Guess what....I was way wrong.  The olives were fantastic!  They were served with fresh hot bread and olive oil, and I completely shocked myself by eating several of the olives with the bread/oil combo.  The fact that the chef was able to create such interesting, delicious flavors to something that I generally loathe makes me believe that they can do a lot of special things here.    Topping it off was that all the other items we ordered (house cured salmon and the mussels) were also delicious, and the beer flight options were extensive, so all in all the experience at Mother Bunch was A+!    As a side note, apparently they just started serving brunch,so I definitely foresee a trip back out to Central Phoenix for a Mother Bunch Brunch tasting in my near future :)

Anytime Fitness is a really fantastic place to workout!  All the equipment is brand new and interactive, and the facilities are incredibly clean.  I really like the fact that it is never too busy so you can always get on the equipment you'd like to without having to wait.  The reason for the 4 stars is because there are just a few things that I would tweak if I could:  1) Have classes to be included in the membership 2) Install the bathrooms with full length mirrors (a girl's gotta check out her outfit) 3) Bigger lockers for your gym bag  Otherwise the staff is very friendly and the gym itself is a great place to go to get your fitness on :)

Pig's Meow, I think I'm in love.  New bar in the Arcadia neighborhood and after being open for only 3 days was packed!  Super cool atmosphere (how can you not love a place with old school games like Uno, Connect Four, and even Atari!), and overall really good vibes.  The bar is tucked away in an unassuming strip mall behind Bosa donuts, and there is a ton of open parking and bike racks for all of your transportation needs.  The beer menu is written out on the large chalkboard wall, and it's massive.  So many unique brews to choose from that I just had the bartenders pick for me and believe me, each one they suggested was fantastic.  They also have a variety of $5 grilled cheeses that are made fresh on the press.  I highly suggest the star (pepperoni/cherry peppers) or heart (fig/goat cheese) for the sandwiches.  Muy delicioso.  :)  Best of all; they have DAILY happy hours until 8PM!!!  Seriously, 8pm everyday PLUS ALL DAY on Sunday's.    Without a doubt, this is officially my new favorite spot!!

When I go bowling on an early Sunday afternoon, I do not expect to pay an arm and a leg for a quick bowling trip.  However, Bowlmor's prices are so extravagant, that is exactly what happened.  For two of us to bowl 3 games, we paid $50.  Yes, you read that right......$50, Five-Oh, Fifty.  Seriously?!?! How does 3 games of bowling cost so much for 2 people?!?!  We were in and out of there within 45 minutes, so it couldn't be the time.    What's sneaky is that the way they have it set up, no matter what, you are bound to pay up the a$$ because they charge you per person/per game; no exceptions.  So, if you and 3 friends want to pop in to play 2 rounds of bowling, expect to pay big time.  Truth be told, if I want to pay higher fees to bowl, I'd gladly go down to Lucky Strike in downtown Phoenix.  It's cleaner, has better atmosphere, and ironically, doesn't cost as much.  Sayonara Bowlmor!!

Counter Intuitive lives up to the hype!!  After visiting the bar on a Saturday night, I can see why it has been rated one of the top craft cocktails bars in the country.  The decor is super eclectic, and from what I understand, it changes every 6 months.  Right now, it has an Asian flair to their menu and decor, so the place is filled with paper lanterns and fun tchotchkes strewn about.  As for the cocktails, they are not only beautiful to look at, but they are mighty tasty.  We tasted the Stilettos in Hand, which was a vodka based drink mixed with thai basil, lemongrass, grapefruit and bitters, and it was absolutely fantastic!  Nice balance of sweet, sour, dry.....it was a perfect cocktail.  One thing to note, is that they are a cocktail bar, so no beer here.  You'll have to go elsewhere for a brewski.    If you're into fun cocktails with a whimsical atmosphere, then definitely come check out what Counter Intuitive is all about!!

Mexx32 is such a fun neighborhood addition!  The bar and table seating is open, not cramped, and the whole vibe of the place is laid back and cool.    We went for Taco Tuesday (who can beat $4 for a taco and a Tecate), and was pleasantly surprised with the food quality and service.  Our waitress was incredibly friendly, and the owner, Lenny, made sure to introduce himself and gave us some advice on what to try for the next time we visit.  One thing that stood out for us, was that the taco Tuesday special is usually a fried taco (chicken or beef), but we asked if we could have our not fried, and they were happy to accommodate. So glad they could do that for us!  Not only was the taco tasty, but the other items we had from the happy hour menu (Mon-Fri until 7pm) were also delicious!  My favorite has to be the breakfast burrito.  Trust me on this one......it's large, in charge, and worth it ;)  Looking forward to going back to enjoy more tasty Mexican treats!

If you are a wine freak like me, then you have to get yourself over to the Hidden Track Bottle Shop in downtown Phoenix.  It is a small (but not too small) shop with an incredible wine and beer selection.  There are a lot of unique wines that you cannot find in the mega stores around the Valley, and the prices are absolutely unbeatable.  Not only are there a lot of fun options to choose from, but the owners, Danielle and Craig, are beyond knowledgeable about wine!  Ask about any pairing, flavor profiles, region, etc. and they will point you in the right direction.  BONUS: They also have a monthly wine club membership that is an absolute steal! $25 for 2 bottles of wine, every month.  And, as a wine club member, you get free wine tastings (which happen every week) plus an additional discount on the wine.  You seriously cannot beat that!  I love shopping so much at Hidden Track, that this is now the only place we buy our wines from.  I highly recommend grabbing a glass, and heading over to Hidden Track for a truly amazing wine shopping experience :)

Sushiholic is a wonderful Arcadia neighborhood sushi restaurant.  I have been there more than 5 times now, and all the food is fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend trying their salmon sushi: it is some of the freshest salmon I've had in the Valley!  I also love getting their spicy edamame, and their crispy spicy tuna (scoop of spicy tuna atop a crunchy rice ball topped with sauce and a jalapeno...it's amazing!).  What's also amazing is that they are almost always on happy hour.....I mean 2pm-close always. It's fantastic!  Definitely check out Sushiholic when you're in the neighborhood.  You won't be disappointed :)

Sometimes you come upon places that are more than what they appear to be, and Street Cafe and Coffee Lounge is just that.  Tucked away on the SE corner of Scottsdale and Shea is this small cafe with an incredible purpose: service.  Not only are they giving great service to those who come to enjoy their breakfast or lunch, but for every meal that is purchased, a portion of the proceeds are given back to many of the shelters around the Valley.  They are paying forward their gratitude to those in need, and that on it's own is already a reason to check this place out.  But what's even cooler, is that the food and coffee are absolutely legit!  They serve breakfast all day, and their pricing scheme is simple: $5 for any breakfast item, $6 for any lunch item.  That's it.  It is so affordable, that you don't expect it to be delicious.....but it is!  I had the Alpha Omega breakfast burger (pork sausage patty with a friend egg on top), and it was fabulous!!  In fact, it was so big that I could only eat 3/4ths of it.  Plus, it came with potatoes on the side, which were also super tasty.  I got A LOT of food, and it was an incredible value.  I will definitely be coming back to the Street Cafe, and I plan on sending as many people I can there in order to keep paying it forward to those in need.  It's a win-win, and I am all in :)

Buck & Rider is one of my new favorite local restaurants!    To start, the views of Camelback Mountain from the patio are absolutely stellar.  Sitting outside with the strung lights, and the fireplace just create such a beautiful atmosphere.  And the food is also outstanding! I am currently obsessed with the Thai King Crab Salad (big pieces of crab, fresh mango, peanuts, avocado....order it, you will not be disappointed), and you can taste the freshness of the fish in all the other dishes.  If you're looking to test this place out, I highly recommend coming on a Sunday evening when they do their sushi and wine specials (1/2 off a few of their specialty rolls and bottles of wine).  Fantastic atmosphere, food and service.  Looking forward to going back!

This place is the quintessential speakeasy! Located down an alley in downtown Phoenix, with no signage, only the red light to lead you.   The interior is writ with red lights, cement walls, and old jazzy surf rock music. There are liquors to choose from, but trust the bartenders to take you down the ultimate mixology path.   And P.S. This place is still under wraps, so I did not speak of it, nor did send you here ;)  Saludos para todos!

Brand new Indian Fusion cuisine in the heart of Gainey!  I came on opening day, so I expected there to be some hiccups, which there were (ex. charged me for dinner salad instead of lunch....but they remedied that), but nothing that won't get fixed over practice/time.    The lunch menu is very reasonably priced for this area, which is nice, and they have a fun array of items to choose from.  I considered ordering the Naanwich (tandoori chicken sandwich with guacamole and grilled paneer cheese), or the Tandoori Shrimp flatbread, but I decided to be healthy and ordered the Inde Salad (salad with tandoori chicken, masala chickpeas and potatoes) instead.  Overall, the salad was quite nice. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, and the masala veggies were super tasty. I just wish that the dressing was something a little more exciting rather than a basic balsamic vinaigrette, hence the 1-star deduction.  I am excited to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood, and look forward to trying some of there other creations!

Spire Health Club is the real deal.  At Spire, owner Ben N. has created gym that isn't your typical Globo-Gym scene.  Instead, he has a private facility that's full of motivating training,  personalized workouts and good people.  Before I met Ben, I used to be your typical gym patron: I showed up to random zumba classes, ran on the treadmill, and did what I thought was right to "get strong".  I had no real path to success because I was clueless as to what tools would really get me the results I craved.  However, once I began training with Ben, it all turned around for me.    Ben is an incredible motivator and truly knows the grassroots of what it takes to get your body fit, healthy and strong.  He goes over it all with you: goals, nutrition...you name it. Under his guidance, I went from being a skinnyfat girl that dangled at the bottom of a bar in an attempt to do a pull up (a fun/embarrassing story for another day), to actually building up the strength and muscle to do pull ups.... and look good doing them!  After my 1st unassisted pull-up, I swear I didn't stop smiling for a week!! I was so proud of where I had come in my fitness goals, and Ben was just as excited for me.  I 100% recommend checking out what Spire Health Club has to offer you.  It has changed my life for the better, and I cannot be more excited to be a patron at such an amazing gym :)

Alright Arcadia-ites....we have a new big dog on the block, and he's ready to rumble with some sweet tasting pizza pies! ;)  I've been hearing the buzz about My Slice of the Pie Pizzeria since it moved next to Pig's Meow about a month ago, and now I understand what it's all about.  When you walk in, the shop itself is unassuming (small restaurant with a giant mural on the wall and a chalkboard menu up front), however when you get to the nitty gritty of it all, it has just what you are looking for: d@mn good pizza!  We ordered the Supremo, which sounded different and amazing, and is was.  The crust was nice and crispy, and it was topped off with chorizo, chicken, green chili's, roasted corn and a southwest sauce.  Holy yum!!  It was unlike any other flavor combination I've had on a pizza, and I cannot wait to order it again for another go at it.    If you're in the neighborhood, it's definitely worth checking out My Slice of the Pie for a slice....or 2...or 3....

Southern Rail has taken a twist on the $20/pizza-wine night that you'll find at plenty of places around the Valley.  On Monday and Tuesday nights, you can opt in on their BBQ & Bourbon pairing.  It's an amazing concept, that is subsequently equally delicious!  You get 2 glasses of bourbon (or bourbon cocktail - I had the Medlock by Moonlight which is mixed with homemade honey syrup and fig bitters.. super tasty), plus a large plate of BBQ food for $20.  The BBQ plate changes daily (our plate consisted of a large smoked pork shank, local farmers sausage, cheesy potatoes, pickled vegetables, and a piece of cornbread...an incredible amount of food!) and is literally lick-your-fingers good :)    And beyond that, the restaurant just has a very fun, chill atmosphere about it.  We sat out on the patio, and had a phenomenal time.  Plus, our server was very attentive and was very excited about the food, which in turn made us enjoy the experience even more.  We are all in for Southern Rail, and cannot wait for our return visit on their next BBQ adventure!
