I booked my birthday party here, mostly because of it's close proximity to The Duce. I was in contact with someone who said she was the Manager, Daron Harvey. She was great and said she would extend happy hour for my party. However, upon arrival, the night of my party, the manager on duty had no idea my party was coming. When I told him that I had spoken to a manager about having my party there and he snidely remarked, "that's weird, I'm the manager." Wow, way to be nice about the amount of business I am about to bring your bar. To top it off, we got there at 9pm, which is what I told the Manager I was e-mailing, just to find out they normally close at 10pm on non-Suns game nights, unless they have 20+ people. So, now I feel awkward 'cause we're keeping these servers past the time that they probably thought they were going home.   The only reason I am not giving them one star is that they were still able to accommodate my party and give us the specials. Except after 1.5 hours of being there, the server asks me if we're all on separate checks. I don't understand how you just assume these things and we had to wait a bit longer to get our tabs. Lastly, I get the rule to add gratuity for such a big party, but the gratuity added was 22%. Random.   Such a terrible experience.

I went to this store to return some scrapbooking supplies. I wasn't sure if only one cashier accepted returns, so I had to interrupt the cashier at customer service. I felt terrible for doing it, as I know it is terribly rude, but I just wanted to make sure I wasn't falling into a line I didn't need to. After saying excuse me, the cashier did not answer nor acknowledge my presence, so I said, "excuse me" a little louder and I get a cold "hold on Ma'am." I'm terribly sorry you are busy and I interrupted you, but a simple acknowledgement in your facial expression would have sufficed.   The part that really irked me was while she was scanning my many items, she made a comment, "you did KEEP some things, right?!" Excuse me? I just went to Michael's and returned $40 worth of scrapbooking supplies in which I had originally spent $50 and I did not hear a single peep from their cashier. I still ended up spending $70 at Jo Ann's with my return. I completely understand and I absolutely hate to do it, but you have a return policy that could easily state that scrapbook supplies are excluded. They are tiny items and I'm sure are a pain to re-stock, but your corporation does not say that I cannot return my unused scrapbooking supplies. On top of that, you are located within a 1 mile radius of TWO other art supply stores, I'm sure it happens.   I have dealt with difficult customers all of my life and never once let my emotions or aggravation show, especially a sassy remark like that. So, to my cashier, Barbara Ann, your attitude just cost you a customer. I will not be giving Jo Ann Fabrics any of my business.

So, I visited this LA Fitness on a guest pass, to see how I liked the facility. Thank God I never paid anything to go there.   When I showed my guest pass, I had to present it to a young kid sitting at a desk who said he'd take my driver's license that day, as an exchange and I'd just have to get it from him when I was done with my class. I thought it was weird that I didn't actually get an official pass, but whatever.   So, I return the next day and of course, it was an issue. Not only that the GM basically reprimanded me for something his own worker failed to do AND called me a liar. When I produced my guest pass on my phone, he annoyingly tossed it back at me. When he asked why I didn't have a membership already, I told him that I kinda work at a fitness studio. He insulted my place of work by saying, he had never heard of it. Obviously, he hasn't it's a women's only dance studio. Then he preceded to pitch me membership options and tell me about his son that is going to be a big rapper. Really? I never returned to finish my 9 days left of my guest pass, even that wasn't worth it.   Just the fact that LA Fitness employs complete degenerates to run one of their locations doesn't bode well for the company itself. And judging from the lack of good reviews for this place without anything being changed, well, I'm not sure I trust LA Fitness at all.  As for the 2 classes that I took, they were ok but the mats that they provide are ridiculous - they're clearly not cleaned and most of them are ripped apart.

definitely something to try! there are SO many flavors to choose from (for the shaved ice) including sugar-free flavors! and the bahama rama mama style is my favorite with added cream and ice cream at the bottom! i would say the only downside i have found so far is that there might almost be TOO many flavors, it's rather overwhelming your first time. there are suggestions on their website on what flavors to pair together, but they don't have these suggestions in store.

Exactly as my rating states, it's just meh.  I wouldn't mind going back and trying something else, but I did not like my burger, it was fine, but not for the price. A little suggestions on what ingredients to pair would've been nice. My black angus patty was crumbling all over the place and my entire burger fell to pieces. To top it off, the zucchini fries tasted and looked store bought :O( Better luck next time...

5 stars and a 40% tip. It was that good.  Smith & Wollensky was the decided restaurant for dinner for a friend's bachelorette party before a night out of club crawling. I mentioned to the host that we needed to be somewhere by 9:30pm. He completely respected my wishes to keep this a secret from the Bachelorette and guaranteed me that we could be out by 9pm. As we left, the host was also helpful in helping us grab a taxicab.   BOTTOM LINE IS: The service was absolutely phenomenal. Every wait staff was very friendly, our bill was split with no questions asked, the waiter offered to take a group picture of us, politely reminded us that we should order soon so we get out of their in time, water was filled regularly, as well as being checked up on regularly, AND we received free shots for the party.   The ribeyes were cooked perfectly - succulent and juicy. The truffle mac & cheese was to die for. The rosemary bread provided at the table was a great start to the meal.

I cannot begin to describe how blessed I feel to have found Dr. Dare. I have declined changing insurance plans for awhile, so I can continue to go to Dr. Dare. As a fellow healthcare professional, I admire his practice and expertise, more importantly, his willingness to help cut costs.  I have been going to Dr. Dare for about a year and a half now and he surprises me every time. I first started seeing him for a problem that turned out to be a gallstone, a problem that 2 other doctors completely overlooked and dismissed as something else. To be quite honest, I am still quite shocked he figured it out - as I had only one vague symptom to report. When I went to Dr. Dare for a prescription, he sat with me and took the time to research which medication would lease conflict with my other medical issues and more importantly, he tried to find the medication that would cost me the least amount of money. I don't know any doctor that would take the time to do that, in fact, I know that some medical schools teach their students to finish the examination of their patients in 15 minutes or less. My most recent encounter with Dr. Dare, he asked me to come in to schedule an MRI if the pain I was having persisted. When the pain had persisted after a week, I called the office to see if Dr. Dare could just write me a script for the MRI so I can avoid paying another co-pay. Not only did he write me a script, they faxed it straight to the imaging center so I wouldn't have to stop by the office.  The minor downside to his office is that, most of the time he runs late. I usually budget 1.5-2 hours for each appointment. HOWEVER, the reason he runs late is because of the amount of care and attention to detail that he provides each patient. It really is quite extraordinary.

Absolutely recommend coming here and renting a private room, especially during happy hour, as the room reservation is half off! They have several sizes of rooms to choose from, so even if you're a small party, it may work to your advantage!  We've rented out the 20 person Karaoke room 2x. It includes a stripper pole, for those of you willing to try and comes with a large sushi platter for the room! Our waitress, this past time, was AMAZING and was willing to work with us. Everyone got a separate check AND they were able to split the cost of the room between everyone, so not one person was footing the bill and had to collect cash from everyone!  The only downside to renting the room is I feel like Geisha is never fully prepared for the largest room. Each time I've gone, we've had less than 20 people and they cannot keep up with our orders. I don't mind as much, except that some people weren't getting there food until we only had 20 minutes left in the room. (for us slow eaters, that's not enough time). So, if you have any late-comers in your party, it really kinda sucks for them!

best bruschetta ever!!! out of the many times that i've been, the ingredients are always fresh!  TO TRY: the bruschetta (i always get the pesto, roasted garlic, roasted artichoke and lastly the mozzarella, basil, etc), caprese salad is VERY good and i've tried the white chocolate macadamia cookie with ice cream on top! it was great!  NOT SO GOOD: i found the Mediterranean plate slightly disappointing, as I LOVE hummus and the taste of their hummus fell short and was rather salty for me. they're caesar salad was not one of my favorites either.  other than that, the atmosphere is great and i try to take at least a monthly trip to la bocca for my beloved bruschetta!  P.S. my most recent visit to La Bocca and a check-in on Yelp earned me a free cookie with ice cream on top :O)

MY FAVORITE: Chicken Shawarma Plate YUM!!!!  Spices has good portions and the owner is always very friendly. The hummus is pretty good, although I do have to say it isn't the best, but still pretty good for what I've had in the area. The only bad I would say is that Spices does not have Basmati rice, which I really miss and love about Mediterranean cuisine. Overall though, I love Spices and frequent pretty often!

I still can't believe how much food you get for the price and how quick the service is. After moving from Chicago, I never realized how hard it would be to get GOOD Chinese food in other places, 'til I found Hot Wok. It's a little rough around the edges and the guy who usually answers the phone is ridiculously mumbled and rather deadpan, but the quality of the food and the price makes up for it!

Absolutely LOVED my stay here! Especially, if you get a deal, which aren't hard to find online or with your M life players card, you definitely get more bang for your buck! The rooms are bigger, the pool areas are nicely kept, the location is very near to lots of big attractions on the strip, and the remote control in the room just adds to the fun! My only qualm would be that everything inside the Aria is upscale, especially food. It was rather difficult to find cheaper food, such as in Monte Carlo, which has their food court. Yes, you can easily walk to Monte Carlo, but it's Vegas, even though they're next door, it still takes you like 20 mins to get to the next casino! Either way, our yearly trips to Vegas are only going to be spent at the Aria!

So, Vdara will be the third hotel on the strip that I have stayed at (other 2 were Monte Carlo and Aria). And I have to say, for the price, it is definitely up there. We booked a corner suite (for 6 girls total) and it had plenty of room. I ended up tipping more than usual for most of the employees I had encountered here.   Biggest gripe though would be access to Vdara to and from the strip. It's a little further back, just like the Aria. However, there is the Tram (have to walk through the Bellagio) and to just walk through the Aria. The place also only has one place to eat (a market place) in the actual hotel and no casino. Also, if sharing a room with people you hardly know, you will get to know them quickly. There is no door enclosing the toilet and it's next to the glass shower. There are doors to the actual bathroom, but when sharing with 6 girls, privacy wasn't an option.  I did book through a timeshare company, but monitored sales and deals for a couple of months before we went, it still had the best deal for the size and price. I will definitely consider staying here again, but for some reason, Aria still holds near and dear to my heart, even though it is more expensive.   I really considered 5 stars, especially with the level or service received and the Pool Cabana was a sweet deal with private pools for a section of 3-4 cabanas. (See review under Vdara Pool & Lounge) However, the inaccessibility to the strip, food and gambling makes it difficult for me to give 5 stars!

My friends and I looked up the best rated buffets in Vegas and found that the Aria was rated in the Top 10. However, we were a little shocked when the price was $39.95 for dinner, especially when our Wicked Spoon Buffet (in the Cosmopolitan), the night before, was $34. Shortly after being seated, we did not hesitate the price. Every person got their own lobster tail (already pre-sliced in half) and unlimited wine! The buffet was great and offered snow and king crab legs (also pre-sliced in half). They had plenty to choose from, even for me, who was on a pretty strict diet of no carbs and no sweets. We found out shortly after that the lobster and unlimited wine was only a Saturday night (or weekends, I don't remember) special. So, I definitely recommend trying to go around that time.  We did end up going to The Buffet at Aria for breakfast for $17. It wasn't bad, just not worth the $17. However, we did get to breakfast late and they started changing up the food for lunch, which meant we also got to fill up on lunch food for the price of a breakfast buffet!  BOTTOM LINE: The Buffet is worth the price during the lobster/unlimited wine night, but you can definitely find pretty decent, cheaper buffets for breakfast and/or lunch

Finally a place in Arizona where I can enjoy a Chicago-style dog that actually tastes like one!!! So, for all you fellow Chicagoans that are missing hot dogs in the only way that Chicago makes them, head on over to Freddy's!

One word to describe Over Easy: disappointing.   It would've been an OK breakfast place if it wasn't for all the hype. I've been trying to visit this place since I found out it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, so when I saw the deal on Doozy of a Deal, I purchased it right away. I made my own omelette with chicken, garlic, and spinach. The chicken was overcooked and the omelette and my hash browns were terribly greasy. My cousin ordered The Wolfpack and was also disappointed with her meal. It just didn't seem up to par with a place that was on Food Network.  The icing on the cake was the Over Easy Ice, their iced coffee. They could've given me a cup of water and cardamom and it wouldn't have tasted any different. We couldn't wait to get to the car to get some gum, to get the taste out of our mouths and even that didn't help. After reading other people's reviews, it looks like they hardly had any caradmom; so looks like Over Easy needs to figure out a way to uniformly make their coffee.  Sorry Over Easy, you were quite disappointing.

Mmmm...The Griddle Platter: chicken, spinach, mushroom and feta on top of potatoes. served with eggs and pita :O)  I've never had a problem with the service here and absolutely love their Griddle Platter! I cannot wait 'til I spend 2 months in Henderson on my clinical rotation to get my fill of The Griddle!  On a side note: I tried my friend's red velvet pancakes (which I found out about through yelp) but, didn't find them anything to brag about. Maybe the hype on yelp killed it, but nevertheless, still good food :O)

What a fantastic experience! The staff were incredibly friendly! I was quite impressed on how quickly they learned our names and were able to give us advice on our form, in order to help us advance. I do not consider myself an athletic person, by any means, and I was able to complete the catch! All you need to do is listen to the instructors and you can absolutely do it! AND you get a diploma after completing your catch! Not only would I return to Trapeze U, I definitely encourage everyone to try it!

I have found my favorite waxer and her name is Christie! Aside from a great personality, her waxes are pretty painless! (and I'm talking about Brazilian waxes!) I've never noticed any missed spots when I go to Christie!  I really have never had a bad waxer here. I do agree with the other posts that sometimes the receptionists seem rather annoyed when they answer the phone or check you in, etc. But, I've never experienced an attitude that was all that bad, so therefore, I am giving them 5 stars!

I guess my experience was completely different than most as I rented a Cabana. I do have to say the pool closes at 7pm, which seems very early, but I cannot remember how the time compares to the other pools I have been to on the strip.  We rented a Cabana on a Saturday for $200 (18% gratuity added after check-out). [Prices vary depending on day and time of the year] You get the Cabana from 10am to close (at 7pm). The Cabana came with water, coke, fruits, snacks, misters, tv, media hub, pool floats and a safe. All included in the price. Our server was PHENOMENAL. When he first showed us around our cabana, he said, "I will check on you every 15 minutes" and he was NOT lying. Always there, taking our drink orders, which they had plenty to choose from. The food came in a good amount of time, with plenty of food options to choose from for a range of appetites and budgets. Note: our friends went to the pool the day before, without a Cabana and mentioned the food took WAY longer for them (and it was chips and salsa). My favorite part about the Cabana is that 2 out of the 3 Cabana sections have private pools in which a row of Cabanas shares.   If you're plan is to relax by the pool all day, you might as well fork over the money, especially since the Cabana has a max of 8 people, so potential to pay $25pp. (again prices vary). Although, I would say to heed caution in ordering, it's VERY easy to spend a LOT of money.   QUICK TIP: the Cabana's are first come, first serve and the Vdara gives you a window to check-in from 10am-12pm. I highly advise getting there early to pick your spot!

I wish I could give them more than 5 stars!!! It takes a lot for me to go back to a salon, especially because I do not have the money to pay for over $20 for a haircut. But, I do not mind returning to the Edge Salon.   I used my groupon for an Express Keratin Treatment and my stylist Becca was incredible!!! She was incredibly knowledgeable about the treatment and gave me such great tips. Most importantly, she has CURLY hair and understands how to manage it! After 25 years, I have never found a stylist that really understands what its like to deal with my crazy curls and she did, gave me tips on it and suggested types of products that I could use to manage them. She was very clear as to not PUSH the product on me, but merely just as a suggestion.   I may have, for the first time, found a stylist that I completely trust. I cannot wait to return for my haircut and color!

hands down, WORST BRAZILIAN EVER!  BRAZILIAN WAX SERVICES? TERRIBLE!! I've been getting Brazilian's for awhile and this was hands down the worst. I've never gotten red from a wax and was red and tender for the next couple of days. It was extremely painful, due to the fact that the waxer didn't hold down my skin while she was peeling off the strips! YIKES! Lastly, she had me hold down my own skin which would've been ok except that she was having me hold down my skin it still had wax on it. By the time I got home my hands and my newly waxed area were sticky from the wax. my friend who went a couple wks before also said it was the worst she's had!  PRICE. you've got to be kidding me. you can go to several other waxers, some of them even pain-free, for almost half the price of normal!   TIMELY? no - took me back to the room 20 minutes after my appointment was scheduled, not too big of a deal, except my friend who went there and was the first appointment of the day, was also taken late for an appointment. also, had to wait awhile for someone to even address that i was waiting at the front (very odd for a small store and i saw the receptionist gabbing away)  FRIENDLY? maybe, but definitely lacks professionalism. when i called to make my appointment the receptionist  continued to talk to someone else while she tried to schedule my appointment. with not so much as a "hold on" or a "i'm sorry." i was confused if she was even talking to me half of the time. i had to repeat myself multiple times

ONE WORD: Gross.   My cousin and I compared the texture of the ground beef kabob to that of her dog's food. The filet kabob, while the taste was ok, had a very strange texture - almost like it was steamed or something. I definitely agree that they are VERY skimpy on the meat, which I guess doesn't matter 'cause it sucked. The hummus was just blah - I could make my own better. Their only saving grace was their basmati rice, which wasn't even all that great either.

ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE *STAFF - incredibly friendly and really try to get to know you. They knew my name after my second visit and I don't think I ever introduced myself.  *PRICE - $25.99 for a spa pedicure and they usually have coupons through money mailer, for $18-19! (includes a foot/lower leg massage, hot stone massage and callus removal) *CHAIRS - comfy massage chairs to sit in that really work out the kinks in your back  I've been here at least 5x since I've moved here and have never once been disappointed!

I went to Casey for my first time to get eyelash extensions for my big brother's wedding. She had a yelp deal and her communication with me was great! I knew I found the right fit. I told myself I would only get them for the wedding, but now I am obsessed!   I have been to Casey a total of 4 times now and my favorite part about her is that she has changed it up for me multiple times. I did not want anything dramatic until I was going to a trip to Vegas and for another wedding, and she was able to go as short and minimalist as I wanted. I love that I can tell her how dramatic I want and she gets it and offers a wide-variety of options.

There's something just not right. For those Midwesterners very familiar with Culver's, well, I would rate this sub-par. It's still Culver's nonetheless and their fries are pretty much what I'm used to from back home, but I've been disappointed in the Butter Burger's the 2x I had been here. The taste just seems wrong, the patties over-cooked (maybe left under the heat lamp too long) and they got my order wrong both times. Eeek.

A great workout for toning, motivational instructors, and a schedule that fits yours!  I am obsessed with this place! As much as you feel yourself getting stronger and leaner, the routine never gets easier. I have been attending since the end of March and the instructors always add ways to make the exercises more difficult to challenge your body every time!   It is the perfect place for toning! I recently completed the 30-day challenge and was able to see a 4% body fat decrease (without focusing on dieting). My entire body has become leaner.   The instructors will keep you coming back! And although I have my favorites, I haven't found one that I don't like. They all have great ways of motivating and challenging you to get the most out of your workout!  Pure Barre is open 365 days out of the year and offers several times that can fit your schedule. I know, as my schedule has varied greatly over the past few months and I'm always able to find a time to go. Lastly, your membership applies to Chandler, Scottsdale and Phoenix locations!  If you're new, definitely give the New Client Special a try ($100 for the month). I have been fortunate to run into several specials since starting at Pure Barre in March and have yet to pay the full monthly price.

I never thought I would review an Ulta. I mean they're all pretty similar from location-to-location. However, this location deserves a review. I had used my 20% off of everything coupon awhile back and stocked up on my foundation. I got home and realized that the foundation I had picked up was not the one that I had wanted. Which is fine, I can return the foundation, but I would have to return it for a DIFFERENT kind and they probably wouldn't honor my 20% off still.   So, I returned to the store and the make-up artist told me that my foundation had been discontinued and that's why I had picked up the wrong one. The make-up artist was extremely helpful and found me a foundation that would be similar to the one that had been discontinued and color matched my skin tone prefectly. So, I proceeded to the check out to exchange my foundation. Without even asking, the cashier gave me the 20% off of the NEW foundation!

Service was excellent from the initial phone call to getting me to a repair shop! Customer service rep was informative and let me know when the tow truck was on the way. Gary was efficient in towing my truck and getting me settled, all the while helping me expedite the repair shop process. I was dreading having to get my car towed, but my expectations were turned around with this company! BONUS: mention yelp for a discount!
