We came here for the first time with our 4 year old son. We loved everything! We all shared the cha-shu ramen and a katstu-bowl. Uhhhmazing! Topped it off with the chocolate mouse with strawberries for dessert. Delish. We will be back.

So, this is my neighborhood hardware store and i come here for everything. Everyone is always helpful and ready to give suggestions with products. But, today, I want to express my gratitude for everyone that helped me out. My key broke in my deadbolt at home. Luckily, i was able to fish out the broken piece of key from the lock and whisked my son back into the car to see if Ace could do anything for me and my broken house key.   Not only were they able to duplicate it for me, but i had no money on me (since my wallet was locked in my house) and they helped me out by waving the key cost.  I cannot properly express how thankful I am at this moment.  I am glad to call this store My Ace.

I went in to get a quote on a canvas print. The staff at the counter was very helpful and I clearly explained what I needed. I got a quote of $15-20 for the print with a 5 business day turnaround.  I was happy to give my business to a neighborhood establishment, so I placed my order.  Unfortunately, I received a message the following week saying that the canvas print would be $50 for what I had ordered. I wasn't about to pay that amount and asked if we could adjust the 3" border of white to a 2" border for $32 canvas print. He said yes, but would need another 4 business days to complete.  This was totally unacceptable since I was expecting a call to pickup my order that I placed a week earlier on that afternoon. I had explained that I was on a time crunch when I placed the order. I would have paid the $32 if it would have been done in the time frame they had told me. But, I might suggest that when you give a quote on a specific service for a very specific size/output, that you be somewhat close.  $15-20 quote that becomes $50 actual price? Really? Thanks but no thanks.

We love this place! Not only is it a delicious lunch buffet, but it is an equally yummy dinner buffet as well! Fat chance finding a dinner buffet for the same price as lunch.  The sweetest people are here to make sure your meal is flawless and truly appreciate your business.  Be sure to stop by and check it out.  You won't be sorry. Be sure to try some of the sweets on your way out.

This is THE BEST PLACE to get your sushi fix! I am so spoiled by the fantastic quality that they provide for such an amazing price. Consider me ruined with regard to any other sushi joint.  $20 for All You Can Eat top notch sushi!  This place is well worth the drive to get there. Meal comes with salad, miso, and ice cream to finish it off (green tea is my favorite).  Be sure to order the sashimi plate prior to your rolls.  You will not regret it. Best cuts of a variety of premium fish all served atop a bed of shredded radish. The staff is very friendly. Be sure to tip your sushi chefs handsomely at the end of your meal. By the time you finish your meal, you will agree that they earned it! This place can get very busy and they do not do reservations. Please plan accordingly! It is well worth the wait. :) They do have happy hour and serve standard dishes if you are not into sushi.

We visited the museum for our first time today.   My 17 month old loved it.  So many activities that we didn't see them all.  My lil guy spent so much time at just a few areas that I think we will be able to explore something new everytime we go there.  I had just as much fun as he did.  We went home equally ready for a nap after such an action packed day! I would like to take advantage of the free first Fridays, but the idea of it being any more crowded than it was today is a hindrance. It was full of people this afternoon. But, if there were large groups of semi-unsupervised youngsters running all over the younger ones, I could see our pleasant afternoon turning into a frustrating one. I do wish the adult admission was a little less than the child admission.  But, I am not complaining. :) Today's highlight was the noodle forest! Bring a lunch and have a picnic out on their lawn!

I just got home from my appointment with D'lisa. I went in for a Brazilian and the first of a series of 3 Lunchtime Clinical Strength Peels.  I had been in before and already witnessed the skill and dexterity of D'lisa's superior waxing skills (this lady is a master of her craft). But, today, upon her suggestion that a peel might do my hyperpigmented skin (due to years of sun exposure) a world of good, we kicked off the series of three.  She combined the initial peel with my waxing session and, I kid you not, I was in and out of her salon in 30 minutes for BOTH services combined!  She knows how to make the most of your time spent on her table.  My skin looks amazing and I cannot wait for my next session with her in a couple weeks.  Do yourself a favor and ask for the peel during your next waxing appointment. You won't regret it.

First off, they have these fantastic movie theater seats that are cushy, red recliners that are fully automatic.  I am so stoked that they opened Centerpoint back up and gave it this amazing upgrade. When you buy the tickets, you pick your seats from a seating chart.  This threw me off at first.  But, once I saw the inside of the theater, it was justified and I was blown away. They are like love seats if you push up the armrest between you and your companion. If you don't know the person next to you, that might be a bit weird. Overall, there is definitely limited seating since the theater is average and the seats are gargantuan. You would never have the "stuffy & overcrowded" movie experience.  You better book those seats early! I did not partake in concessions but the soda machine looked very self serve and state of the art.  I will be coming back here for sure.  Hey Center Point! Think you might get a child care service/option at this location? If so, you could have a ton more business.  I know I sure would!
