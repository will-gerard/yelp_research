What the hell? This place doesn't even deserve 1 star, but I guess I can't submit without it. I remember when you could get 2 chicken Parmesan subs for 10 bucks! Now it's $8 a piece, plus $1 extra for ranch that's advertised as an option for the sandwich, a $1.50 credit card fee, then another $3 for delivery?! What the **** Gus? tell your staff to SLOW THE HECK DOWN when answering a call. I thought I called a Chinese place when the girl answered, and after  eating this "food" I sure as hell wish I had. Never again! The health department needs to check you guys again...

BEST SUSHI YET. I cant speak for the service, as it seemed a little lacking that night. But to order Nigiri, 2 Rolls, Sake Bomber and get Edamame all for $35?!?! Absolutely unheard of! The rolls were amazing, expertly rolled and as fresh as you can get for "desert" sushi. I will definitely be returning as the experience overall was untainted by the "meh" service. I would recommend this for the sushi lover looking for unusual rolls and the best price I have paid in the Valley yet. All I ask is that you leave me room to come get my fix. (As an aside, my buddy loved the service and even got the waitresses number. Although it does sound desperate when the host asks you: "Do you plan on hitting on anyone else tonight.")

Like all others, I'm experiencing the same billing pains. After being told I would need to shell out close to $500 for one MRI after already having had to make pay arrangements for a prior that only cost $300. I call BCBS only to be told that there was a nominal CO-pay. What shady business is this? It's terrible to think that a business supporting the healthcare industry would be willing to add financial pain to the physical experience. Shame on you.

AWESOME thai, especially for what I have had at the same price. Portions are big enough that 2 entrees could easily be split between 4 hungry college guys. Thats saying something, especially when their pad thai packs a punch to your mouth with heat and flavor, without putting the burn on your wallet. Good form!

I wish I had paid attention to my fellow Yelpers when it came to delivery. As someone who has worn the shoes before, it is UNACCEPTABLE to get upset about a tip. You deliver the order wrong and get nasty when I tip accordingly? This place is a joke, at least the counter girl admitted that everything was frozen/premade when I called to complain. Save your funds and go elsewhere for food, the Taco Bell adjacent is a better bet.

Came here for the free show with A Change of Pace/Damn The Weather and fell in love with the venue. From the moment I approached the door, the scintillating and seductive sounds of Flamenco Por La Vida spilled onto the street, stopping me in the front room as I passed through the doors. Apparently, they are a Saturday night staple and worth the trip alone. The front room is intimate, and the bar has a decent-above average selection of wine and beer. No food this night, but the show was fantastic and the staff knowledgeable. Great to come into a concert venue and not deal with cranky bar staff and bouncers, even for a free show. Thanks for being classy, I will definitely be back! (I am reserving the final star for once I taste the food, so expect an update at somepoint in the future.)

Lets just say, after a lifetime of homestyle haircuts and DIY buzz cuts, I found a real barber! As a 3x annual haircut kinda guy, Polo did an impressive job of getting rid of the winter shag. Quick, clean and well cut! Thanks again Polo and see you in 4mo.

Okay, so let's start off by saying I tried these guys off balance and out of their location at the AZ Taco Fest on 10/18. The tequila pork and the chicken taco they put up were IMO, the best ones I had all day. I spent some time chatting with one of the reps at the tent about the food and how they do things and was pretty enthused about house made salsa, seeing as how everyone has their own version. The tequila menu would be a big draw for those looking to step out of the Patron/Cuervo repertoire, but I like that they now offer a special where if you buy a regular entree, you get a penny Margarita! I am looking forward to visiting the home location and seeing just how they stack up against my taco testing to urge zones when they have a full kitchen.
