Hello, I have been going to Dr Riley for almost a year. I moved, Got new insurance and needed a new Dr that was close. As a new patient I was nervous, how ever when I got there the front office ladies were very friendly and the Dr spent about 30 min with me. I had lots of questions and concerns about my health ( it had been sometime since I had seen a doc). I'm approaching 38 and preventive maintenance is now important. I found Dr Riley on YELP, I found all of the reviews helpful.  Thank You To Dr Riley and all the staff at Biltmore healthcare!!!

I have given this nail salon 5 try's. That is over $250 in mani and pedis! I will never return! I just paid $57 for a mani and pedi, I still have dry cuticle around my nail, my shins are red because the young lady did a continuous up and down motion on my shin bone which was extremely painful! Did not clean under my toe nails, my feet are still rough! My little flower is cute though. Do not waist your money in this place! I am in the beauty biz and typically do my own mani pedi at home. When I do pay for a service I expect good service! It is just so disappointing.

I had high hopes for this place, I did a walk through a week or so before I made my apt. It seemed nice with friendly staff.... Seemed clean.... Two weeks ago I took my yorkiepoo  in for a groom, now, on Friday I will take her to the vet for skin mites. The frustration is real. I'm so very sad about this. The vet bill is going to be very real:( I will not return

This is what I just witnessed. A lady was waiting patiently for her order, it never came. She went to the register, very nicely, and asked for a refund because her lunch break was about to be over and she could not wait any longer. The snot behind the counter said, oh I accidentally voided your order so we never charged you, she was very snotty about it. Never offered to rush and make one one the house, never apologized, absolutely zero customer service. Then when the customer left, hungry, the snot started talking trash about her, with zero regards to all the other customers listening. Youth these days, need to have better people skills and customer service. The only reason I gave two stars, is because I got my order... Finally!

.99 cent pastry with purchase was great. Absolutely not worth the price point. Food  had NO love in it. Thrown together, grilled quickly. Need a person that loves what they do in the kitchen. It will show in the dinning room.

I was very impressed with the customer service! These guys educated me so well on how to care for my new vape. The equipment is top of the line and not over priced. I had purchased a vape from another place months ago($60) and it was broken after a month. I'm so happy to find good quality and customer service under one roof!!! Thank you guys!!! See you soon

I love this little place! Fast and easy! The only woman that has given me a gel polish that stays on for 3 weeks! And I'm in water all day everyday!! Go see Sandi! She is great!!!
