The service was lousy. An elderly attendant w/glasses was very short with us customers.  I had to repeat my order for coffee. She said have a nice day; but in s way that felt F-you. Geeeeez.

My wife and I gave this place a chance. We had a hankering for BBQ. The host seemed nice enough, just kind of brash. (he served as our waiter too) The place is a sports bar w/booths. Straight-forward/nice atmosphere.  We arrived at 1:30 pm. Not many people inside, so don't know why it took our host so long to get us our menus.  We ordered a 3-meat combo with two sides to share. Got the KC short ribs, pulled pork , and turkey. When we got our food, we were surprised at the skimpy portions. Skimpy for a single serving, especially for the price.  The ribs were dry, not fall off the bone (tasted microwaved) The pulled pork was flavorless, like it was boiled. The turkey might as well have come from the grocery store deli department (again heated with a microwave). The BBQ baked beans ok (really sugary though) The coleslaw was boring.  Although the host did well filling up my ice tea, I don't think he understood how to cultivate our interest. With the lull in customers, he could have ensured a better experience.  Long/short ...I would NOT recommend eating here.

Bring the kids! This place has lots of good flavors. Icys and frozen custard...YUM!  I first tried this place in Maryland. Couldn't believe they made it to AZ.  They have a simple treat that anyone can afford.  Their flavors are not "sorta tastes like," they absolutely taste like their specialty flavors...like PB&J, cotton candy, swedish fish, etc.  Go get some!

This was my first time here; but won't be my last. I enjoyed a #25 off their menu. The way they craft their sandwiches is innovative. These pressed and baked sandwiches have several intesting types of combinations. The staff is real friendly too. Just the right size. -Andy
