It looks like a diner, it is priced like a decent restaurant and it tastes great. The idea here is simple you are paying for quality of the ingredients, not the table cloths or snooty waiters.  Our meal started with the fried motzerrla  7.95. It came as 5 huge hunks of cheese, with a great marana sauce. This was made in house, not frozen sticks from a box, they come as large triangles.   Meals include a some great rosemary bread, olive oil and soup or salad. For my main I had the spinach ravioli in a pink sauce $15. This was a generous portion of homemade ravioli with enough spinach to taste and rich ricotta cheese. The sauce was luxurious and packed with savory goodness.  Service was fun and family like, the meal ended with a complimentary piece of homemade fudge.  Maybe this is not good for a 1st date but its good for a great meal or  a casual 4th date for when the food matters more than the looks.

Great fast fried seafood, cash only and a few other options.  Don't be confused this place consists of two establishments and one kitchen. One is a bar with waiters and liquor, the other is a fast food style place. I chose the latter. Walk in and you will find a menu board with a few specials printed out hanging off of it, no frills, no credit cards, all local flavor.  I went with the Titanic special $10.75 Which included a "monster" fish sandwich, and two sides, I chose fries and onion rings.  Everything is made to order, which means crispy fries, rings and a crust on hot flakey fish. The fish here is the real thing not some unnatural square, a large fillet of mild white fish with a great breading on a simple bun. The condiments are on the table and up to you, tartar sauce, hot sauce, a spicy "famous" vinegar and ketchup. It was a big sandwich but not titanic maybe just queen marry.  Bottom line if you want some fried food and have cash give this a try.

It is a cafeteria, I say this with all of the negative conotation that comes with that phrase.  Located in the beautiful Viad tower (former dial building) on the 2nd floor is this dimly lit cafeteria.  There are several stations including a sandwich station, grill, "world" and salad stations. At each station there is a small illegible at a distance sign of what is available.  Most food is made to order, which is problematic as I had to stand in line for over 10 min with a tray to get my meal, then there was another line to check out.  I ordered the salmon, which is not on the menu but the raw fish was on display.   I ordered the fish and it was slapped on the griddle with a generous amount of clarified butter, there goes the healthy idea. Th fish was over cooked. As a side I selected a grilled vegetable salad that was ok but lacked flavor. The combo was about $6 with out a drink which seemed steep for a cafeteria.  The one nice thing is the fact there are several condiments at the exit, including buffalo sauce which was nice.  The sitting area is clean and nice.  Only eat here if you are stuck in this building and pressed for time.

One menu lunch or dinner, nice views of the fountains especially at night, and a decent south western ambiance. Your standard is a bowl of chips and salsa. Not just any chips,  a Melody Sweet potato, flour with a sweet chiptole dusting and corn chips.   The menu consists of many tex-mex foods.  I sually stick to the seared Ahi tuna sandwich served with fries. The Tuna is of high grade with a spicy seasoning. The bun is standard as are the fries. all for about $10  My friend usually opts for the "black and blue quesadilla" a steak and blue cheese quesadilla that is busting with flavor. This dish can sometimes lack consistency and the cheese is not well distributed in the tortilla.   Even if one skips the desert you are treated to a small white chocolate desert wrapped in a corn husk, it will make your hands sticky but it is worth it.

Dining Guadalajara was more like eating in Guadalajara, complete with a wait for a table despite having many opens ones and a questionable security guard at the front door.  We were in a cave like room waiting for our table, luckily it was just a 5 minute wait for lunch.  One inside the main dining hall we were able to see the large size of this place, tables finished wall decorates but a unfinished ceilings and no windows make up the inside.  I oped for the chillies relleno off the lunch special menu $7.50  most of the lunch specials range from 7.25 to 8.50.  From seating to our main course we had over 5 different people visit our table.  The chips were nothing special bu I do like the the spicy and thin salsa here.  My chillie rellno was a bit different, the sauce was a bland tomato based sauce, the chillie it self could have used a bit more roasting and the cheese seemed a bit thin.  Overall the prices seemed high for the location, and quality of food, I would sooner go to la canasa.

I showed up to this little place today with my co-worker. I was wearing business clothes, pressed wool pants' long sleeve shirt etc. I did not fit in or match the decor, but that did not matter.   I read over the menu atop their cast concrete counter full of fun inclusions like a fork. Surprisingly there were several vegetarian options. Even the soup of the day was meat free.   I had "The Fin" it was a tuna wrap, but not canned tuna, cooked tuna full of marinated flavor, accompanying it was a mango salsa, purple cabbage slaw and garlic white rice in a red tortilla. I opted for the jalapeno cabbage soup of the day as my included side. For $7.25   The tuna was great despite looking over cooked, the soup was truly great. I do not like soup but I liked this soup, it was creamy without cream and had a great spice note.   The service was fast and friendly. Moreover, our food came in a neat little bread loaf tin.   There is a small patio both front and back and indoor tables and high tops. Parking is a bit tight.   This is what a lunch place should be. I will be returning

Take a trip to Mexico with out even leaving the city.   I made my first trip here today with some co-workers for lunch. Parking was tight.    I walked in the door to a very colorful (literally) scene packed full of people. Upon entering I was offered a sample of ricotta cheese on a piece of tostada.  What a great way to start a visit I love samples, I love cheese, and new places.  Words can not fully describe how eclectic this place is. There are many types of foods that you will not find anywhere else.  The perimeter of the market is dotted with cafe's from a Fish one, street deserts, juices, bakery and Mexican food.   I oped for the fish cafe, I had the fried talipa vera cruz. There was several pieces of lightly battered talipa covered in a fresh mix of olives, peppers onions and tomatoes.  It came with 5 fresh corn tortillas, rice and beans all for $5.73.    I took the meal to the other side of the store to have it with my friend who had Mexican food. I enhanced my meal with the many items from the salsa bar, included fried peppers, and a avocado salsa. It was a great meal especially for the price.   My friend had the barbacoa, which he also really enjoyed.  Part of the fun was the sheer exotic nature of the whole market. My co worker who is from mexico said it was just like the markers in Mexico.   I will return again as there are many many exotic (to me) things I still wish to try and at the low prices I can afford to try them all.

It looks like I will be the lone naysayer but I was not too impressed with this place. It was my first exploration into Salvadorian food so it was the best Salvadorian food I have ever had.  With that said, the location is a bit hard to find as the parking and entrance are in the rear.   We sat down and looked at the menus, which lacked some English descriptions for many items, I can speak enough Spanish to know foods but some important details were missing.  I opted to try two things I have never had before. Yucca and pupusa with cheese and layote.   Yucca came with some pits of fried meat that I did not even want and my meat-eating friend did not like. The Yucca itself was good but not too diff rent than a potato wedge fry, I guess starch is starch.   My pupusa was a cheese filled flat pocket I did not even see or taste the other filling. It was a bit runny from the cheese and lacked a firmness I expected. I used the accompanying bottle of hot sauce to add some flavor however, the sauce lacked any real heat. The chips and salsa were decent but nothing special.   The prices for the pupusas seemed good at $1.75 but the yucca at $5 was a bit steep.   I will give this place one my try and I will be going with my native Spanish speaking friend.

In the hot AZ summer going to Coronado island is a great idea, however if you can't make the commute the Coronado Cafe is a great 2nd choice.  This place has everything you need for a great date.  Quaint and romantic old house setting and patios. Table cloths and faux candles Menu full of artfully presented items Wines by the glass or bottle Background music in lieu of background noise.  We started our meal with a gargonzola salad, which they did a split plating for us. $6 The greens were fresh the cheese was bountiful and pungent the walnuts were candied and the slices of apple were crisp, what more could you want from a salad?  For our main dishes we had the Cherve Rellnos $12, Two large pablano chilies stuffed with well dices zucchini other veggies and goat cheese on top of a generous pile of polenta and a roasted red pepper sauce, it was amazing.  The other main was miso glazed salmon with sauted spinach and basmati rice. The fish had a nice crisp crust, the spinach had a nice flavor and the rice was well just rice, it could use a veggie in it to to spice it up.  Bottles of wine start at a affordable $12  The meal included bread with olive oil.  Bottom line great romantic place for dinner or lunch.

Good flavors, good service, Interesting dishes odd pakora.  Walk in and you will see nicly set tables with table cloths and cloth napkins. There is a buffet with plates behind. This makes it a bit confusing as to which end to start at.  I started with some pakoa and mint chutney. The pakoa was the low point of my meal as it was oddly hard as if it were fried twice.  Moving on the the food at least the veg items. There was a Palak dish which had great spice as well as some cabbage dish that was miss labeled  and full of great flavor and textures I went back for more. The chana masala was also quite good spiked with many fresh veggies in sauce.   I am a big fan of their naan bread, it tasted as if it was made in a fire tandori, it really complemented the meal.  If you are in this area of town give it a try.

I used to hate studying, but one must study the massive menu before placing an order.  There are 2 Menus in one. Dishes that start with an A are the gringo dishes, Kung pow xxx mu shu vegetables etc. Then there dishes that start with a C, this means a dish unaltered from china. In come cases this means unusual ingredients like pork kidney, or just copious amounts of peppers as with the seczuan dishes.   Being veg it took a bit of time to tease out dishes that were meat free and still had flavor but we managed a decent array, however I really want to go back and try some of the more exotic dishes and see if they can be made meat free.   While the food is good, they may have a bit less service than the number of tables need so don't expect white glove service. But at these prices $6-8 for most dishes who cares.

Pros: Great Bread, great fresh mozzarella cheese Cons: Price, Lack of indoor seating, Lack of fountain drinks  I come here for one thing and one thing only mozzarella cheese, the fire baked bread is a plus.  Every sandwich comes with very chewy caramel candy. For beverages one must choose from a small selection of designer drinks. You must eat outside on a wood pick nick table or take your meal to go as there is no indoor seating, which can be a bit of a problem when the summer is 100+ degrees. The line can also spill outside in to the heat too.   They are lunch only  .  The front of the store acts as a small niche marking with some very pricey natural options.   If you want some of the best mozzarella cheese ever go here and try it in sandwich form with some fresh basil and nice red tomatoes. It is worth the trade offs.

"Let's open a place just like Sabbaro but give it an early 90's artistic decor" is what they probably said before opening.  I just went here for lunch, I am taking a class in the same shopping center. For years, I had passed by but was never impressed by their menu. Today I finally broke down just for the sake of being able to review them.  You stand and order cafeteria style. The menu is divided into pastas, pizza, salads and sand witches. Pasta items are in the $7.50 range +$2 for chicken. Pizza is in the $6 range for two slices, a combo of one slice and a salad could be had for $7.50. Overall, the prices seemed a bit high.   I opted for two sliced of the Bianca pizza. The crust was soft and a bit doughy, on top was mozzarella cheese, signage, ricotta and tomatoes. After I told the line what I wanted y food was hastily thrown into the oven, such haste was use my food overlapped other food, I did not appreciate this.   I took my food to the utensil and condiment station, there was Balsamic vinegar, olive oil and red pepper but no Parmesan.   My slices were of normal size and the toppings had a decent flavor but the crust was subpar and at this price, I expected better.   Unless you are stuck in this plaza, I would not recommend making the trip to this establishment.

4 Stars for beer only 2 for their food. One of the best micro brews I have ever had was here. It was a cask conditioned IPA that was just incredible. It is great that they offer a cask conditioned beer and a rotating seasonal beer along with the wide selection of standard brews. Prices are on par for a micro brew $4-5 per pint.   My dinners here have been fine but nothing special just common bar and grill food. The Nachos were decent but cheese on chips can't be bad. the selection is a bit uninspired in the food department. Burgers,  sandwiches, pizzas, salads and the usual fried appetizers.  I will be going back again and again for their great beer.

Good sushi, good noodles, good prices good times.   So do you want Javanese food? Chinese like dishes, or Italian. Yes they have all three however we stuck tot the asain theme this time.  We started out with a sushi roll,  Spicy tuna with Avacado ~$6. It was fresh well prepared and tasty.   The on to the Kake noodles, a nice broth with fat udon noodles and clumps of spinach for $5 a real bargain and fun to eat.  For dinner we had the Ahi rice plate, A sliced ahi steak over brown rice with a side of mushroom sauce. The quality was decent for 11.50 its not sashimi grade but its good.  We also had the tofu steak, which is just large cubes to fried tofu with sauce and rice $8.50. I could have lived with out this.  Service is fast and friendly, meals come with bread and a sweet cookie.   Stop in give it a try its cheap nice and tasty.

A ad on a the Middle East radio forum reminded me about this hidden little place.  I stopped in for lunch and the options were quite unique. I had a miso base ramen with salmon in it. What a great combo for 6.95 The miso was light and the noodles were firm the salmon was poached in the broth and full of salmon flavor.   The meal came with bread and a few sweet things not a match but good non the less.  Good food wide variety give it a try.

Yes I would like some French fries and falafel with my pizza.   I just went here for lunch again, I go every few weeks. While the name may say pizza there is a interesting array of food here. Fish and chips, falafel and tuna pitas, Mexican food on Wednesdays and Sundays and many Italian classics.   One of the biggest pros for me about this place is that it is all vegetarian, kosher too for that matter. So if its on the menu, there is no meat on it in it or even near it.  This time I had a flafel pita, the pita had a bit of a crunch from it's toasting on the oven, Inside the pita was some crunchy on the outside moist on the inside falafel, fresh cucumbers and tomatoes with a tahini sauce.  It came with a side of fries and additional tahini.   I also had a small slice of cheese pizza, the crust is thin but has a nice consistency and the cheese is pretty good too. Every table has garlic oregano and red pepper but the Parmesan is missing.  There are fountain drinks and bottle drinks for sale, but no alcohol.  Note they are closed Fri night and sat afternoons.

Fish enchiladas or the 5.99 slices and a drink special.   This was the dilemma I faced today, as Every Wed and Sunday is Mexican day. The Italian and other favorites are still on the menu, but you can also get an array of meat free Mexican dishes.  For 8.99 I had one of the priciest menu items, the fish enchiladas. Three talipa stuffed corn tortillas toped with cheese and green sauce, served with rice and beans. The rice was nicely seasoned and the enchiladas were full of fresh tasting fish.  My friends ordered a whole pie well done, and man it did look good.  This place is mostly veg (except the fish). They are kosher so they are closed on seemingly random days and Saturdays.  Most food is cooked to order and fresh, and fast. Nice staff and both bottled and fountain drinks are available.

Happy hour is designed to make one happy. The fact they had one sat evening with things I like on it made me happy for a new hours.  There are a few 1/2 priced sushi rolls like a Spicy tuna and Phily roll. 1/2 some apps and beer $3 specials.   The rolls are regularly 7.50 ish so 3.50 on happy hour, as for quality it was decent however with a spicy tuna or Phily roll it is hard to really mess them up. The added avacado to them was nice.  We also had a veggie spring roll $3.50 Then 1/2 off for happy hour.  A soft rice noodle skin around fresh veggies sushi rice and peanut sauce. It was great like Vietnam meets Thailand.  They were nice enough to turn down the loud music for us make it a pleasant place to be, the curtains are cool and the beer selection included some micro brews. Not bad at all.

Quite the ironic name for this restaurant.  I think their name should start the term "Americanized" or "subdued." The dishes on the lunch buffet were standard but they lacked the vigor that good Indian food has.   I have gone here a few times for lunch with co workers, the vegetarian selection is decent. The fried items can be a bit soggy from sitting out too long.  The lunch buffet now is topping $10 which is pretty steep of a mediocre lunch. I feel like there should be a discount at places like this for vegetarians. The Naan, and water is brought tot you by a server so you may feel the need to tip on top of the buffet price.   There is the stereotypical bollywood music videos playing on the TV, with their psychedelic colors and lavish garb. Many of the serving trays make extensive use of aluminium foil which I doubt meets health code.

They almost made me think there was an ocean near by with the large selection of fresh fish.  I have visited this chain in several states and I am always impressed, parking at this one can be a bit annoying unless you just park in the adjacent center walk over.   My visit started off wit their menu, which is printed daily and frequently changes, great for variety but hard for a reviewer to say try this dish. There is a very wide selection of fresh fish prepared to different global styles.   I started the meal with the salmon cakes, salmon spices breadcrumbs and more all cooked in to a little mound, they were moist and crisp, the flavor balance was just right.  For my meal I selected Ahi in a Asian presentation, This was served very rare if cooked at all sashimi style, there was a small coating of sesame seeds, a side of soy and wasabi. The quality of the fish it self was un paralleled. This came with an again style ginger cabbage slaw salad that was great.  I did attend an event here once which had the most amazing fish presentation I had seen, there was a whole salmon cooked, and its body between the head and tail was skinned, thinly sliced cucumbers were used to create edible scales.   I also enjoy the option of semi private tables, great for a date. They are in their on little cube / room with curtains that can be closed to provide additional privacy.  For seafood in the valley this is my #1 recommendation and if you are ever traveling check to see if there is one at your destination as I found them to be quite consistent.

The only thing less fresh than their 1980's decor was the food on their buffet.  Walk in and you will be greeted by an eccentric person in a leisure suit, you can either go in the glass doors with acrylic handles or in to the mirrored room with zebra booth and old conference table chairs. No this is not a gentlemen's club it is a a restaurant that just lacks windows.   For Mother's day they had a buffet only setup, and what mom does not love cold food that has been sitting out for an undetermined  amount of time. The croutons in the Cesar salad were soggy as were the crustinni under the bruchetta. The pasta was cool. Even worse the butter soaked farm raised salmon cubes were just luke warm. The vegetables were mush and again just luke warm. The mozzarella in the caprese on the buffet was not made in house as it was firm and flavorless.    The real amusing part was on the dessert section. There was a plate of items straight from Costco, lemon bites, cookies and cinnamon twists just as you would by at Costo, on a plate and picked over.    This is one relic that is better left in the past, horribly dated decor, sub par food at high prices means this place should be avoided.

If things really do taste better when some one else is paying for a meal, than I may be over rating it.   I have been here several times for company functions, as such the menu was a limited selection and service was a bit slower due to the large group size.  That aside I did like many things.  Croissants, need a I say more. I am pretty sure this on table bread option trumps any other type of dinning, chips and bean dip may have a shot at them.  You meal begins with a basked full of warm flaky croissants. Wine sever promptly follows. I frequently started my meal with a salad consisting of soft bitter greens bleu cheese and candied walnuts, the pungent flavor of the cheese contrasted by the sweetness and crunch of the walnuts went well with the soft buttery bitter greens.   For my main course I went with the salmon. Honestly the salmon here was good, but nothing special above or beyond what you would find in any quality restaurant.   The deserts here are great too, a perfect way to please a date.  Dates are where I really see this place shining, dark romantic atmosphere , semi private tables, french food it has what you need.  Note while there is some self parking it is very limited unless you go to an adjacent paring lot.

Valet parking for groceries and a sandwich?  I don't get it.  I finally visited this place for lunch with some co workers. First parking was a real issue and I hate having to valet my car.  Once we were inside there was a very long line, with a less than inspired menu of sandwiches salads and a few burgers.  I went with  a veggie sandwich, the ingredients may have been local and organic but who cares when its small and not tasty.  If you want to seem emo  trendy and impress a girl and go to a locals only joint then check it out, otherwise don't bother.  Also the whole grocery part escapes me unless you can live on birdseed and condiments.

This was the place to be! back in 1983 now time has been harsh to this place. Maintaince issues and rough edges detract from this place.  Ceiling  lights missing their covers, Tiles on the outdoor baseboards falling off and covered in over spray from a cheap paint job. Staff wearing tuxedo like clothing that on paper looked good but in reality was wrinkled and a thin facade.  The food here too lacked any unique presentation or flavor. The bar did seem to have decent prices, and to add to the class the urinals in the restroom have cup holders so you can bring that drink with you.

Please do not ration my hot sauce! When I say I want a lot that does not mean 2 thimbles instead of one. Also please warm up your precooked ingredients before you slap them in a burrito.  I went on a trip here with a Friend after a hike, we were hungry, and his out of town guest wanted to try a "taco stand" so after driving around the shadier parts of town for a bit we found this place.    I ordered my usual Chile relleno burrito. Here they fill the space around the Chile with rice cheese and sauce. However my Chile it self was cool as if they just pulled it out of the refrigerator. The one surprising thing is that I did not get sick.  My Friends seemed content with their burritos however there was an extreme shortage of hot sauce, we shared it, then we fought for it, it was a truly sad scene.

Second chances are a good thing right? I decided to give this place a 2nd chance and introduce a co worker.  It was entertaining ot see my coworkers reaction to the 3rd world conditions inside, and his attitude change once he bit into this burrito.  The food is the real star here with the tortillas as the backbone. I recommend getting your burrito foot long style for $.85 more. Not only is it unique it ends up being a decent value as you get 33-50% more than a usual burrito.  The chips are nothing special but I do like the hot sauce in the ketchup style pumps.

Slow services, mediocre value and dull flavors.   If you are going for a gut bomb don't you want it to be the most wonderful gluttonous meal you can have? If so this may not be the place for your next calorie bender.   Inside an hard to access due to light rail old fast food joint you will find this place.  The menu is simple enough, But ordering will take some time as one person is the cashier, order taker, phone person and even waiter to bring over the food. I can only imagine the kitchen has the same setup as our food (alll fried) took nearly 30 min to get.   The fried fish it self was decent but nothing special, a bland cornmeal crust over white. fish.  IT was fresh testing but the bland breading did not due much. A big issue I also had was with their sauce rationing, why must I pay for more tartar sauce or cocktail sauce, is it my fault you did not put the flavor in the dish it self?

When there are many choices, consumers win. In NY this is true for pizza and in down town phoenix this is true for Mexican food.   Azteca fills the void between a generic Arizona Mexican fast food place and a sit down restaurant. You order at a counter, but the food gets delivered to you. The food is on a plate with a garnish, but the plate is disposable.   The menu has all of the items one would expect, tacos, burritos, flautas, tortas etc. The one unique part you might notice stems from the "& bakery" part of the name. On the wall there are shelves full of fresh Mexican baked goods, like cookies.  I opted for a Chilie Rellno burrito $4.25. Like all meals this includes a small carboard tray of corn chips while you wait. The only salsas are the traditional red and green sauce, they were good but nothing special. The burrito was quite good, inside a nicely warm and toasted tortilla was a fresh chillie rich cheese and smooth beans, all garnished with lettuce and cheese on the side.  There are a few tables inside and a few more on the patio I think I group of 6 or 7 is the max I would recommend for this casual dining spot, that is  good for a cheap lunch.

This is the largest urban park. Moreover, that urban part is great because I am 10-30 minutes from three major trailhead areas.   For hiking I like many points of entry, one of my favorites is telegraph pass, this is on the south side of the mountain. A new recently remolded parking lot is found on desert foothills parkway. There is a paved path that is about 1/2 a mile and at its end Telegraph pass is to the left and Desert classic is to the right.  Telegraph pass grows in steepness towards the top where there are some larger stairs. At the top, there is a bench and you can then continue on National trail. If you head west, you can reach a great Ramada.  From the pima canyon entrance I take the fire road to national, after the initial ascent it is just some rolling hills, I then make left to hidden valley where there is a great natural tunnel, Follow this trail to reach fat man's pass, contrary to the name there is a narrow gap that fat men cannot pass luckily you can go around, this meets back up with national trail. Many unique rock formations on this hike.   For shorter easier hikes from this lot, you can do the east and west loops and Beverly canyon all small trails that loop, and have a few nice views.  For Mountain biking my skills are not too advanced so I stick to the east end of desert classic, with mostly straight section and a few wash passes and slight hill inclines it's great for a novice rider.

Good quality great portion sizes and good prices.  If you are looking for a solid sushi place n the east valley this is it. Their sashimi plates are unparalleled in value. A ever changing menu of speciality rolls will keep you interested and their birthday celebration procedure can not be beat.  One thing to be aware is they auto add gratuity at 4 people not the standard 6.

For far to long I put this place at the rock bottom of my brewery list in town, it seems that I was mistaken.  Many years had passed since my last visit here, and after an invite from some friends and a good tasting at the last yelp event I went in.  We sat on the large patio to enjoy the great spring AZ weather, it also enable us to accommodated upwards for 20 people at our conjoined table.  Happy hour was in full effect $3.25 beers (in a mug) and $5 pizza's and appetizers.  I started off with a stout, it was nice full bodied not to bitter and with a rich head. I learned that each beer is made on site with their own local recipes  For food I went with the margarita pizza ($5 on HH $10 normal).  TO my surprised it was cooked in a open flame oven and it was almost a Bianco style pizza, it had fresh motzrella , basil, tomatoes and pesto on it. It was pretty good but a bit low on the crust to topping ratio.   Service was decent for a large patio party too.  Happy hr is  3:30pm - 6:30pm & 9-Close all days, give it a try

I like to tour art museums and galleries around the world,  however I have noticed the price of the art is some what steeper than what I pay here.  I have found numerous abstract pieces in nice fames and matting that work well in my house and office. It is all about luck as the selection changes day to day.   I also come here for belts, ties and occasionally dress shirts if I am lucky.  As stores go I like Ross, this location is middle of the road in terms of selection.  If you are old or know some one who is, take them on Tuesday and save %10 for senior citizens.

The new menu offerers a some interesting choices that are not the standard fair at a chain Italian reastraunt. This location usually has a short wait to get seated.   On my last trip to this location I had a fairly typical experience. I ordered the Parmesan crusted sole, that comes with a risioto. I get the lemon butter sauce on the side as it can be quite heavy. The dish is a fairly decent dish however my food was only warm when it made it to the table and each fillet was not fully crisp on both sides.   Service at this location seems to be a frequent issue. again we were st at a table that had no assigned waitress. They were out of table cloths, some other server had already written their name on the table and the olive oil for bread dipping was pre-poured and collecting dust. Drink refills were slow and we had to ask to get pepper on our salads. Again service for bread drinks and the check was slow.

Things took a turn for the worse.  The evolving menu means that even the few veggie options like the mushroom ravioli even have meat broth in the sauce. The couscous that comes with the sole is flavorless compared to the old orso, and the other grilled fish dishes are just small.  I wanted to have a creaser salad with my meal at 6pm  but they were out of salad, and they were not even busy.  New menus and poor ordering by management mean I wont be back here too soon.

This is not just another store front taco shop.  It has quality and variety and value.  I stopped in here on a rare rainy day for lunch and was shocked by the long lines at 11am. The phone was raining with call in orders and the line grew. This was a good sign.  There is the over head menu full of the usual Mexican taco burrito total fare, and s small black board with specials.   I overheard the lady in front of me asking for a veggie burrito $.3.50 (a black board special) and to get it toasted.  I decided to do the exact same and added some chips for $1.    The burrito was great filled with beans, peppers onions and more. The toasting made it quite hot and added a extra crunch to the tortilla I could have lived without.   The hot sauce was still hot from cooking, a decent Smokey spice note and very thin, I really liked it. The chips came in a small paper  tray not much for $1 but they were good and thick.  Despite the crowd seating was decent with many 4 and 2 person tables in the long narrow setup.  There is a small soda fountain with the usual. And a free spiced carrots that were great, mostly spice not vinegar!   I will be going back to try other items.  Casual fast and decent quality.

From a veg point of view this place was a total flop. The online menu shows a fish sandwich, however in store the menu item was missing.  Unlike you usually Greek esque place, there is no falafel. I resorted to hummus $2.95 and for that price it does not include any pita, so I was forced to order a peta for $.90  The hummus came in a small Styrofoam cup not worth the $3 and the pita was soft and warm but again worth nearly a $1 I think not.  Most of the menu is beef gyros, gyro meat plats or gyro sandwiches.  There are a few salads on the menu but I am not a salad person.  I think I miss the pizza hut that used to occupy this location

I am really impressed by this facility. Every machine you could want, Racquetball courts, The best spin bikes anywhere, large arobics room, free weights, TV's on the cardio some with ipod hookups, pool, spa and a steam room.  Sure the staff may be incompetent, and the sales people are probably very shady, but luckily I was grandfathered in from PureFiness and rarely deal with either.   One of the biggest negatives for me is the parking lot. There are more speed bumps in the parking lot  per 100 feet than you will see in your whole day. I do not know why they felt it necessary to put so many of them. I can not drive my convertible here due to them.  I also am unsure about the aroma of the free weight area in back, To me it smells like a barn, but I think it is due to the glue used on the floor. Either way I do hope it dissipates soon.  The machines are nice they usually have two to three of each type of machine with the latest being the eclipse line that are very smooth and easily adjustable.  The spin bikes are great, very smooth, digital read outs and so far 100% functional.  A small grip with the TV's on the cardio equipment is the channel selection. News stations sports, E and some anti acne channel. I would be happier with the local mix of channels.  The pool area is nice with a three lane lap pool, sizable spa, and steam room. They are cleaned nightly but there are some grimy spots that could use a bit more attention.

The flavors here are truly great, if you like garlic and spices this is your place.  So if you have a 2pm business meeting you may want to find something else, but if you want to make your tast buds hit the international disco floor give the lunch buffet a try. There were the usuals, pakoa, aloo tiki, raita, and then mostly common food but well executed.  For me the winners were the saag, a green spinach based concoction packed with garlic and exotic flavors which may even be healthy. The korma was my other favorite with clunks of veggies paneer and a creamy curry sauce.  The meal also inclues garlic naan (nice touch), chai tea and desert.  For desert may I recommend the rasmali. a sweet creamy milk sauce with balls of cheese that have the texture and taste of cake.

This is a great find, Large menu full of interesting options, helpful staff who can help you craft a vegetarian compatible dish if you don't see it on the menu.   For me this was my first venture in to authentic Korean food and I really liked it. fresh flavors that on the surface seem healthy. Food sizzling in pots, fresh cracked eggs a real adventure compared to generic Asian food. \  There are many tables and service is decent but it takes time for the hot pot to get hot so keep that in mind when odering.

I was so excited when I saw the menu for this place.  W walked in and the atmosphere seemed decent too.   We started with the onion rings. Fried onions how can this be screwed up? They found a way the bater was flavorless and the onions were just a bit to raw and hard. ($6)  We had our included salads and hey were good, just lettuce dressing crutons and the obligatory garnish of cucumber and carrot.  I had the MACADAMIA MAHI MAHI $11.99,the price was great, but the execution was anything but, it tasted just like the frozen stuff I can get from the store, the crust was soggy and the fish was over cooked and it did not taste fresh, this is nothing like Roy's version.  A family member go the pineapple "shashimi grade" ahi $11.99 This came over cooked despite asking for it seared and and too much of the white sinuous Grissel in it for a "quality" ahi.  I really want this place to be good, but it just was not.

We are truly lucky to have this place locally. If you need a electronic part they have it.   Weather you are building a elephant mind control machine, fixing a stereo or overclocking a calculator they have the tools and parts you need.  I have bought many things from them, but the hardest to find item was a 1pf capacitor. No one sold them in numbers that a non manufacturing company would need execpt this place.    It is on the West side of Country club just after the train tracks underpass.   Yes this store is quite geeky on the level of living in a basement evil genius lab.

I have know of this store for decades, however I don't drop in often enough.  I went in this weekend to get paint and other supplies to make my car look new again.    I was prepared to pay for a custom paint mix, which they can even put into spray cans for those of us who don't own a air gun paint setup. However I was lucky and found the illusive color I needed from duplicaolor which I had searched many auto parts stores for.  In addition to auto paints, sandpapers polishes and everything else you could need to get the job done, they have a large selection of auto fasteners.  For added fun and interesting factor there are many museum displays around the store. From a giant allision engine from a fighter plane, to the body from a dukes of hazard car.  Prices a good and they even have a "happy hour" on bondo from 3-5 pm every day.

On any given weekend I will make at least 2 or 3 trips here.    My house sits 1.5 miles away from two Home Depot's and this Lowes. I usually choose to go to Lowes.  For hardware only ACE can beat them. One day when building some used office furniture I needed a Swedish cam bolt, and they had them.  For floor epoxy their quikcrete brand can't be beat. I also like their Krylon spray paints.  The main advantage of this store over other home improvement stores is the thing I am asked often. "Can I help you."  Every Dept no matter if i am in nice shirt or covered in paint and dirt. At their competition I could die and no one would even notice.  Pro tip. Park on the East side of the parking lot. Go in to the lumber entrance, you will get a close shady spot and be near the registers with no lines.  Next time you have something break and you want quality products with helpful staff, check this place out.

This once was to be a family favorite. We usually went every other week. The Fish selection once was plentiful. The value was good. However this is ass become less true over the recent years.   The fish selection both fresh and off the normal menu had dwindled. On my last trip they did not even have Salmon. The Mahi Mahi has been gone for years, and if there was ever tuna on the menu the price and the inability to cook it rare made it a poor choice. I went here with my family for one of our now rare trips there. The wait was short, and the service was pleasant. My main complaint was the menu. The only fresh fish were talipa, trout and one other option, I don't recall.   I went with a full order of the trout, over their newish "wood fire grill option." I found that it imparts a stubble smoky char taste that works well with the high surface area of the trout.   As usual the meal came with a Cesar salad that was acceptable, and their butter, salt and cheese laden biscuits that are great way to add mass to yourself.   Due to the lack of fresh fish my parents opted for an old favorite, the fried flounder. This is possibly the best fried fish out there. It is also one of the cheapest items on the menu. I recommend you try it at least once.   Until the fish selection grows and the ever increasing prices stabilize I won't be coming here too often. I just wish there was a good fish place on this side of town.

I think I need more adventitious dining parents, at their request I returned here with them for dinner.  There was no wait at 6:20pm on a Sunday, perhaps the rising prices and dwindling fish selection has disparaged more than just myself.   As if the fresh fish selection of four was not small enough, my fist choice, the trout was no long in stock. I decided to give the Cajun tilapia a try. I know tilapia is a garbage fish but their menu did not leave me much choice. The fish was dry, tasteless and had the texture of a overcooked fish stick. On the side was broccoli, that was over cooked and limp, probably from a frozen source, and then French fries.  As usual the meal included, a small Cesar salad, and the salt filled cheese bisques.     Our waitress was a bit odd, she seemed to have just finished orientation and said all of the lines about the menu, etc, it was a bit awkward.

A new trend is emerging, poor ordering. We arrived and asked for the fresh fish menu, to our surprise they did not have one as they were out of most of their fish.  The Blame for this lays solely on a poor manager not ordering correctly. We should have just gotten up and left, be we stayed due to time issues.  I had the wood fire grilled salmon. It was over done, and the quality of the fish was impressive as the color was straight from a salmofan and there was very little salmon flavor, defiantly not a wild sakeye.

If you can get a seat at happy hour than you are in luck, however as this place has become more trendy getting a seat is harder and harder.   Nightly exec pt Sundays there is happy hour from 5-7 and 7-9M-T and 10-12 Fri and sat. I have been here many times, always for happy hour.   The happy hour menu includes several drinks specials that include sake bombers, margaritas, girly martinis and light beer. The food side of happy hour is what makes me a fan. The avocado eggrolls are incredible if you like avocados. There are several gourmet pizzas, some non-raw fish sushi rolls, and other miscellaneous appetizers all at great prices.   Inside next to the bar seating is one of the best fish tanks outside of an aquarium to be found.   The biggest issue is the crowds making it hard to get a table or seat for happy hr or reverse happy hr.   There is patio seating in a semi outdoor seating, which is unique and nice.

First time back for reverse happy hour in years, and I still really liked it.  1/2 apps and rolls. Great deal!!  he tuna on won ton crisps were quite good, the wasabi mayo was a bit over powering at times.  The Flat bred was fine, but I prefer the departed island pizzas.  The avocado egg rolls are just amazing, crisp, decadent and luxurious with the sweet dipping sauce and slaw garnish salad.  Frozen Margarita had a bit of a kick.  Over all great value and can even have some date appeal. 9pm on weeknights is a great start time for reverse as I age.

I had some of the best Ahi tuna I have experience in a long time. Rare actually did mean rare, I am glad to see that their cooks have been trained in the are of tuna searing.   The tamari tuna is basically a sesame crusted seared tuna on a bed of rice and veggies with a great Chile sauce, think of it as an upscale jap-mex fusion.  The tuna itself was of a very high grade, sliced thinly and a dark ruby red. It was tender and lacked the sinuous bits cheaper ahi can have. The flavor was fresh and well accompanied by the tamari crusted sesame seeds.   I also had a small salad with their sesamee ginger dressing, which is so good that  I would order in cocktails if it were not frowned upon.   There was also a copious amount of corn bread so I could get my south western starch fix.

Great beer made on site, and some unique deep dish pizzas make for a great happy hour and reverse happy hour.   Despite the recent rise in the price of the mini pizzas the half off deal at happy hour is hard to beat. The deals on the beer are not the best, but they quality makes up for it.   I really like the spinach artichoke pizza, Imagine taking a pizza and using a creamy artichoke spinach dip in lieu of tomato sauce. That is one rich deep dish pizza. Couple with a tatonka stout and it is one great meal to indulge in.   Some of their other great beers are the Jeremiah red. As the name implies it is a red Irish beer. Usually there is a Belgium seasonal high gravity beer whose flavor and alcoholic punch is are to beat.  For happy hour beers are $1 off mini pizzas are 1/2 off and most appetizers are $2 off. There is some deal on well drinks, but then why come to a brewery to drink anything other than beer?     If you find your self feeling the effects of the beer too quickly the potato wedge fires make for a great sponge to soak up some of the happy juice in the beer.  Don't forget you can get a growler (1/2 gallon) of beer to go!

Fianlly a happy hour that made me happy.  If you want some great food and drinks on a current economy budget the daily 5-7 happy hr may be a good choice for you.  $5 specialty drinks including a pomitini poured at the table. This drink was quite good and yes girly.  $5 appetizers including a great seared Ahi with a Jicama carrot salad. The Ahi has well spiced and of decent quality.  There are other $5 options as well.  $6 burger that looked huge and induced 2 onion rings and a challa roll for a bun.   There also is a $12 ahi burger that is more of a croquet style with 2 onion rings or a portobello burger too.  This happy hr is available at the bar era, or in the more relaxed patio. There are heaters on the patio for the cooler nights.  With thees prices we kept eating, and eating and yes eating. We left stuffed on great food.  I recommended a side of the saluted mushrooms of the menu as they really enhance any meal.

Who does not like smashing someone else's nuts and then having them clean up the mess?  This is exactly what you can do at Teakwood's.   Some bars of pretzels, some have trail mix, but only Teakwood's has buckets of peanuts in the shell. Selling them is part of the fun, Crack em' or smash em' then throw the shells on the floor. That's right the floor, so you can imagine this is not the most elegant place.   Every night has some drink specials and a decent selection of beers as a good bar should. The food is well executed bar style menu expect to see your cheese laden and fried foods.   I brought a friend here who had a particularly bad week and day, I did not think anything could cheer her up. After pounding on half a bucket of peanuts, her frustration was gone.

This is one of my favorite resorts in town to visit as a in town tourist.  They have live music and big fire-pits n the weekends in the winter. A giant pool  with sand beaches a slide, more and great drinks in the summer.  They even offer free EV changing even though it is a very cumbersome process to obtain a code and activate the charger.  One small issue is that in the conf center Verizon gets no data sevice. A big issue with all of my work devices are verizon.

It is like a parallel bizarre universe, you walk in everything seems familiar but not quite right.  This is what Sams club is, it is like costco, but just not nearly as good, lower quality products, a odd selection, useless staff and a lack of customers as a result.  The only highlight of this store is the Hummus, they sell Sabra hummus in large family size containers for a bargain at $6. I did see a recent addition of a house brand and I hope this is not a sign of change.  If you want a sample you are out of luck too, despite there only being a hand full of other customers, the sample people are painfully slow, and do not create a cache of samples to buffer demand.  I walked around and just felt odd and out of place. Also prices on some items are much higher than other places. A 1.75 of Makers Mark  Bourbon was $35 when it can be had for $27 at Costco.  Unless you have Agoraphobia there is no real reason to shop here.

I am just s sucker for a chips and salsa bar. This is the only location I am aware of with one. Inside an ex McDonalds sits this Filibertos, on island in a decaying parking lot. The menu is standard for fast hole in the wall Mexican. This may not come as a surprise to my readers but I opt for the chili rellno burrito. I really like their take on it. It consists of the obligatory chili rellno but it is surrounded by guacamole and a tortilla, simple rich and oh so good.  As I stated before the draw of this location is the free chips at the salsa bar. The chips the usual well ground corn chips slightly warmed, but the free party really adds to the meal, on average I think I can add over 1000 calories for free to my lunch.   Adding to the self serve fun this is one of the few locations with a soda fountain that you can access for free refills.

You know those great little sesame things in pub mix or tokyo snack mix? Well they sell them here in bulk and in 5 flavors.  I make it a point to stop in here when I am in the area to pick up fresh bulk items.  Their wasabi peas are some of the best, up there with the ones from a can at a fraction of the cost.  The Sesame sticks are great, they have plain, honey roasted, cheddar, garlic, and even unsalted, however the unsalted lack flavor.  This store also has a good beer section, a wide variety of small cuts of sea food, a slew of organic tv dinners and a decent produce section.  Tip: Skip the bag and save a few cents.

New York pizza is not made on a conveyor belt oven!  Electric, Coal or Brick are the real ny oven types.  Here they use the same oven that any Papa Johns, Domino's etc uses. it does not create a proper crust, but this is just one of the problems.  The crust seemed to have corn starch or excessive flour on it creating a paste in my mouth with many bites.  The staff seems to be a bunch of high school / college kids who rather be socializing than tossing pizzas.  the inside is large and has decent seating, but why come and sit here when there are many many better options.   Even their coupon is misleading as with the 1 topping coupon you save a whopping $.75 on the first topping,  Don't come here for pizza it is low quality non NY style food.

What is the proper name for a olive farm anyway? I am sure it is not a garden, it can't be a vineyard, orchard or patch so what could it be? I guess this is why there are no olive dishes on the menu at the olive garden.  Like any other chain the food is predictable and sometimes uninspired. However there are several dishes here that are well executed and the sheer volume of food helps this chain break the 3 star chain curse  I went here with my family for dinner as they are afraid to try anything new. I started my meal with the included minestrone soup, which is vegetarian. It is good once I add half a shaker of pepper to it.  For my main dish I went with the Manicotti formaggio. The ricotta is what really makes this dish special here, it is firm, dry and flavourful compared to the watery creamy found at most places. The dish comes with three large flat pieces covered in a chunky tomato sauce and topped with melted mozzarella. Of coruse there also was the obligatory over salted bread sticks.   This particular location is due for a renovation, I really hope the new chairs are similar as they are one of the few comfortable chairs to be found at a restaurant.

It is never ending pasta bowl season. Gluttons and bargain hunters take note.  For 8.95 you the the usual salad or soup and bread sticks. You then pick the pasta and the sauce. This year the special sauce is a "creamy parmigiana potobello"  There also are the usuals of marinara, meat, Alfredo and 5 cheese pink sauce.  Then pick the pasta, many shapes plus a whole wheat option.  Then eat, if you finish move on to another bowl of the same or any combo, Just note the 2nd bowl is much smaller as is the 3rd and any subsequent bowls.

You would be crazy to come here for the caprese.   I liked the idea of this place but the execution along with the prices doused my enthusiasm. Nearly  $8 for a caprese is acceptable if its amazing, but here it was a salad form, cubes of mozzarella, tomatoes and onions (who puts onions in this?) and far too much balsamic on a beady Italian roll. For $3.50 it would be good but at this price I would rather have some fresh stuff from pane bianco.  My co worker had the spaghetti with a meatball and he liked it, however he never express much of a desire to return.  The inside is smallish with a order counter and a few tables but it was quiet as we were the only customers.

To say we didn't fit in was a bit of a understatement, but my co workers have gotten used to this feeling when they go to lunch with me.  Hidden in a old small strip mall is Garden express. Inside is a menu board,  a order window and a few chairs to wait at, not eat at. In this respect it is like the Rtio's of Chinese food.  The look of the place is old and dirty, the menu board has a fair amount of dirt on it.  Unable to locate a vegetable dish or tofu I asked what they had w/o meat.  This limited me to lo mein, chow mein or rice with veggies.  I went with the former. I ordered the large at $6.50 + .50 for chilli oil. My co workers got the lunch combo of orange chicken, rice, lomein and wonton chips for $4 (or $5 with a massive egg roll).  My noodles were over price, and uninspired. A few piece of broccoli was the only veggie of note in it, the MSG was obvious and the chili oil was not even that hot.  My co worker liked the sides but did not like the chicken.  I was hoping to find a gem in the rough, instead I just found the rough.   PS Cash Only!

What they lack in seating and credit card acceptance they make up for in flavors and textures.  Thursdays are Chile rellno special days, for $5.45 you get a chillie rellno, beans, rice, tortilla  and a small drink. A real steal but the value goes way up when you try the food as the flavors are great, rich thick red sauce, a firm texture to the rellno and rice that goes very well with their hot sauce.  Note in summer it may not be great as there is ONLY outdoor seating and waiting, and they are Cash only.

I visit La Canasa several times a week, a week mainly due to their proximity to my office. Luckily their food is pretty decent as are their prices.  If you are going here for lunch you may want to avoid arriving right at 12pm as the line out the door can be quite long. For lunch you order at the counter, and take a number to your seat, and they bring you your food. Tipping seems to be optional in format of dining.   Another unique aspect is their Chips and Salsa bar. It contains the usual corn tortilla chips and the delectable flour tortilla chips. If you have never had flour tortilla chips you are in for a surprise.  The menu consists of the usual Mexican fast foods, burritos of all types, tacos, enchiladas and plates. There are also soups and some authentic items for the brave. For lunch you may want to look at the a la carte menu and save a few dollars unless you are huge fan of rice and beans. Another money saving tip is to forgo the drink as their soft drinks cost upwards of $2  I often order the chillie relleno burrito. It is a item I try everywhere as it has many different recipes. Here the burrito has the obligatory chillie filled with cheese covered in a very eggy egg batter and a hot red salsa mix heavy on the peppers. If you like your food "enchilada style" you can order it this way for an extra charge or simple walk over to the salsa bar and smother your burrito with salsa.

They finally went back to the slightly larger water cups, so only 5 refills are needed with a meal for me. I am still fighting the 2.25 drink.   Also on the flour tortilla chips they are not ut into smaller more manageable pieces.  I got here at 11:15am and just beat the massive lunch rush.

The Pico de gallo is gone, the water cups are big again and they have new green number tents.  Not much else has changed sinch my last review update. The flour tortilla chips are still the gem here.   The red picante sauce is smooth and good enough to drink.  Al la carte is still where the deals are at.  The Patio is the place to be in this weather.  Chillie rellleno burrito is still eggy and unique.

Ketchup with some spice, that was their version of salsa. 10+ minutes until we could order, and it was not even good.  Our visit started with a beggar outside of the door asking for money. We entered and were surprised by the pleasant decor. We waited a few min and were then seated.  Once we were seated we had a good amount of time to look at the menu and the waitress took our drink order but was not even interested in our food order.  A bus boy delivered s very small basket of chips and carafe of the ketchup based salsa.  We finished this basket long before our order was taken.  I ordered a Chillies rellno $4.99 a la cart. Most items are a bit pricier here.  It took some time for our food to arrive. When it did I was surprised by the small size of the portion. The quality was also on the lower end the breading was not crisp and there was little to no sauce on it, very little cheese inside and a over-sized dollop of sour cream on top.  We had to flag down the waitress for more water and chips which also took some time to come.  Even the bill paying process was slow.

Start off your trip here just like the cows did, corralled in to a long orderly line, but you will be met by some one who takes your order not the slaughter house.  If you are not a meat eater your options are limited, and on my visit they were out of veggie burgers. Luckily they have a cod sandwich (4.79). If you want a side think cut fries are a steep $1.75 for a small tray or they have other options like fried zucinni that is upwards of $3  The condiment section is great with jalapeños peppers sauces galore onions lettuce and tomato.  for a drink they have a new coke flavor wave which is always fun, and there is a bar that is connected with free popcorn which is a big plus for me. (that is why its 4 stars)  My fish sandwich it self tasted of char and the included tar tar sauce, the bun was soft and fresh. Despite saying its was some large fraction of a pound of fish it seemed a bit thin and small.  Overall if you are a vegetarian, pescaterian you can make by here but it should not be your first choice.

I had high hopes going in.  I figured local  fish n' chips chain this popular must be good. I had heard stories about their great sauce, and fish. However I was less than impressed.  A coworker of mine suggested we go on the way to a meeting. When we pulled up I noticed that the only dining was outdoors, but the place seemed busy which is a must for anything with fish in the name and 100+ degree summers.  I ordered a number 3 which was 3 pieces of fish fries and 1 cup of sauce. Yes the menu tells you how much of this mythical sauce each dish comes with. One of the good thing was the price it was about $5 and I got a discount making it about 4.50 for my meal with a cup of water. Note this was cash only.  I waited patiently for my food and the pickup window finally called my order number. With great excitement I opened the grease covered bag that my meal sat in to find square shaped pieces of fish. I really was hoping for fish in a more natural shape before it met the hot oily depths of their deep fryer.   I then opened up the cup of sauce and to my surprise it is not a tartar style sauce like I assumed it would be. The sauce is a franks red hot sauce with with some ketchup, far from anything special. the one cup of sauce was inadequate for the amount of fish and fries I had. If I wanted more sauce i would have cost me an extra. There are no other condiments available, so if you like ketchup you are out of luck.  The batter of my fish was passable it just seemed like a McDonald's fillet o fish sans the bun, cheese and sauce.   The fies were thin and a bit underdone.   Overall the meal was quite mediocre and I would have enjoyed it more from a chain like Long John Silvers.

This place is surprisingly nice on the inside and has a wide array of menu options.  This is not just another ***bertos it is a hybrid seat down place.  You sit, get a menu that's not on the wall, and then order to a person at your table.  The menu if full of great options from traditional plates and Mexican fare like burritos and tacos, to less seen in the gringo world real gorditas.  Your meal will start with chips that come with some salsa bean mix on top.  I am not sure if it is veg so be sure to ask them to leave it off if you care. There is a salsa bar with one of the best red salsas I have had in a long time, green salsa, avocado dip, carrots, pico and a crock pot of beans again probably not veg.  Prices are pretty good my chillie rellno plate was on special for $6 a huge plate with rice beans tortillas (corn or flour) and a great large chillie rellno.  Sure this may be a bit west of the trendy down town but it's worth a try.

Go west for fun adventure and good values. West of the i17 that is.  With some convincing I got a few of my co workers to try this place. From my office at 18th ave there are 12 Mexican food places before we reach this lone Asian Buffet.  Walk in and you pay $6.50 plus tax for all you can eat and drink soft drinks.   Grab a plate and marvel at the eclectic mix of foods, many Chinese favorites, some buffet usuals like the wide mix of fried foods and random jello deserts, and then discover the most out of place and best thing, GARLIC BREAD.   For veggie they had bean sprouts, lo mein with veggies, a veggie fried rice, fried bananas, butter potatoes, french fries and fresh doughnuts.  They also had a good amount of fish, some type of skin on roasted fish in a butter sauce, a fried fish and fried whole tilapia.  I was very happy to see a wide range of hot sauces to put on the food including siraca at the tables, chillie oil and chillie paste.  The Booth are very 1986 looking and are well sunken in.  Overall the value and quality here is good and none of us got sick afterwards so it passes that key test.. Their last few heath ratings have been all silver, so give it a try!

Soil classic ameri Mexican sit down food, with a few good and quite veggie options.  The chips and salsa are quite standard and decent, The veggie enchiladas with mushrooms, zucchini and more are also great, large full of well sauteed veggies in a flaful sauce and smothered in the obligatory cheese.   The real key to the rating here was the speed, at lunch one does not have the time to wait 20 min for food and 10 min to order. Here you can order with in a few min of sitting down munch of 10 chips and 6 min later your hot food will arrive.  This makes it a great place for a lunch meetup.   There is plenty of seating but not much parking so carpool if possible

Mama Mia thats a good pizza! And I mean it!  There are many places that seemed to be well liked on here for NY style pizza, but this one deserves a great rating.  To start off I was encouraged they used the exact same pizza ovens as the places I like in NY, not some conveyor belt pizza over. The crust is tossed, not pressed, and well done is the way the pizza is done.  From the online menu you may not know they sell pizza by the slice. Cheese slices are $2.50 + .50 per topping, but why mess with a good thing. Sicilian squares are $3.50 and stuffed pizza is $3.95  The cheese slice was great, the crust was crisp, the cheese was rich yet done enough to have some of the oils separate, the sauce was flavorful and not sweet and there was a hint of basil.  The Sicilian slice was great to with a true twice baked crust, and just more of all of the great flavors of the cheese slice.  The stuffed veggie pizza was good two. Like a mini Calzone sans  cheese, the crust was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside the filling was subtle but fresh.   Their menu also had pastas, salads and sandwitches. I must come back to try the pastas too.   During lunch one orders at a counter and then picks up the food from the counter when your number is called.     Bottom line, great pizza with out the crazy waits or prices at other good pizza places in AZ.

Thai rama ding don't go here.  There are many better options and the $1.50 you save is just not worth the shortcomings.  Service was lax, the spring roll was hard and cold, the rice was dried out on top and the dish lacked spice and a good flavor.  It was a Wednesday lunch a11:30 and this place was already packed which is usually a good sign.  I went for the lunch special Mango Delight $6.50 "hot" of course.  The cabbage soup that is included came out, but to my disappointment it has chicken in it, not veg friendly.  Our meals finally started to arrive (about 5 min apart) which is annoying as I like to eat when my food arrives but I also have manners.  On the plate there was a small portion of fried tofu with veggies and grilled mango, while the grilled mango was nice the rest of the items were lackluster. As I stated the rice and spring roll both had issues and the wonton chips were not the freshest.   If you really want to add an odd element to you meal there is the spicy caddy that has Thai chilies in an extremely foul smelling liquid. Thoughts of that smell alone still haunt me.  Bottom line at $6.50 the lunch prices are good but the lack of quality and taste lead me to go elsewhere.

This visit was quite good. Maybe with out the rush of lunch time can be put in to each dish.  We start with a curry soup. IT was large enough to feed 5. The flavors were rich and the veggies were fresh and plentiful.  For the main course we shared many dishes. There was a wide flat rice noodle dish that had a great Wake flavor form the hot wok on the noodles and egg. The curries were nice too however a bit mild for my tastes, be sure to ask for the spicy caddy.   Prices were affordable about $8-9 per dish

I think the name and good ratings should tell most of the story. It is a house that sells great fry bread! Granted fried bread is always good, but their take on it is great.  What really keeps me coming back to this place is their hot sauce. It is a amazing blend of red peppers and a sweetness that I can not put my finger on. I sometimes drink it straight from the bottle much to the chagrin of people around me. For me the fry bread is simply a good substrate to deliver this heavenly red sauce. I have tried it on savory items like the bean and cheese fry bread. I have also tried it on the sweet ones like the chocolate syrup and powdered sugar fry bread.  What I am saying is TRY THE HOT SAUCE, it is groin grabbingly transcendent. - As Homer Simpson would say   The menu has some non fry bread options but I have never seen anyone order them. The small parking lot fills quickly, so be prepared to park around the corner. The line can be long as well as they move at their own pace. It is worth the wait.  This is one calorie laden stop that is worth a try.

The service is getting faster which is great as I can' wait to get my food once I order.  On my last visit I went with the vegetarian taco, it was good but had a bit too much sour cream for my liking,   After killing off  bottle of hot sauce my coworker ordered the chocolate and butter fry bread for a heart attack and desert.   I tasted it and to my surprise the fry bread goes well with sweet as well as savory. I then tried some hot sauce on it. IT WORKED chocolate and the sweet spice of their sauce are a magical combo.    Try it, then call me crazy.

HUNG,  this word has many different comical means, however I am not sure what it means, or why it is the sign next to the maxium sign, either way it made us laugh.  At the request of some one else on my team at work we went back for lunch. It was fairly busy this Friday.   I quickly found the dish on the revised menu I had been looking for. I could tell you the number, or name that only a member of the VC could pronounce. It is a vegetarian bowl of soup with tofu vegetables and noodles.  It arrived with every one else's main dish and looked quite appetizing, it was very hot, the broth was tasty and the vegetables were crisp. I was hoping it would come with a Pho` style side of greens and bean sprouts, sadly it did not.  My co workers love the taste and price of their Chinese lunch specials.   Service was slow, and again my water was never refilled.  There are a fair amount of vegetarian options and the taste and price is good, this makes up for the bad service.  I will be back again.

This area of town has many Vietnamese options and this one sits in the middle of the pack.   There are only a few vegetarian options and one must search them out in the menu. I had the stir fired veggies with egg noodles 4.69 +1 for tofu.  The flavors were pretty standard and the noodles were good, what was lacking was the spice condiments, there was just siriacha and sambal, none of the garlic chilie oli you may find at other Pho places.    Server was marginal, it will not impress anyone

I think we were the only people in here for lunch on a weekday, and I could see why.  This is the place that time has forgotten, old, tables and everything else. The menu was somewhat generic.  Our dishes were mediocre at best I don't have much to say other than there are many better choices for you.

Why would you name a restaurant after a thing designed to keep people out? Just like china this place is huge inside, and even has tanks of live fish.  The menu is huge, and this is just the menu for the gringos. If you know Chinese there is a whole menu of family meals that you can order from.   There are many vegetarian dishes not just the usual tofu and veggies, they have a large selection of exotic mushroom and veggie dishes.  I had the golden mushrooms with tofu $7.99 a house specialty. Mitake mushrooms a light brown sauce and huge pillow of soft fried tofu. It was nice ans somewhat light  We also had the black mushrooms with Chinese greens. $9.99 This dish had a very earthy taste and the greens were very fresh but hard to eat with chopsticks.  Another great dish was the veggie hotpot that had some really interesting textures along with the noodles and veggies.   Service was a bit lack luster, but maybe that was due to the wedding in the other side.   The shopping center it is in is a bit run down too so you are assured you are paying for quality food and not the building.    Bottom line great selection good flavors good value mediocre service.

I think their name should be Vaqueros Grande Burritos  As our burritos were HUGE.   We stopped in after a hike, inside is reasonably nice all things considered. There is a free chips and salsa bar allays a huge plus and a decent menu.   I went for a $4.35 vegetarian burrito, it was a mix of just about every non meat ingredients  a place like this has, cheese, lettuce guacamole sour cream etc. It was a bit messy to eat and the sour cream made it quite rich.  The salsa/ hot sauce here is great smooth and quite spicy.  Stop in grab a burrito and be full.

Bland Tex mex for those afraid of real Mexican flavors, and despite the name there was little NewMexican on the menu. I could best describe it as eating at a hotel style meal.  We opted to sit on the patio and enjoy the nice weather, it was odd that we were escorted out of the front door to get to the patio. The lighting was dim making it hard to read the menu.   The chips and salsa did not arrive for over 10 minutes which is a bit odd. Some one at the table ordered a bean dip appetizer that came in a small dish, and was a bit lacking of flavor. The tri color chips looked nice but were a bit stale and the salsa lacked any green chilies spice I would expect from a NewMexcan spot.  I went with the Enchanted Garden Enchiladas, with red and green sauce, The veggies inside were crisp but the enchilada sauces again were very bland and spice less, the rice and beans were nothing special. $11.95.  Aside from the lack of flavor the other issue was the long wait, in all it took 1:25 to eat here, waiting for the meal and then the check seemed like an eternity.  I say go elsewhere for Mex style food.

Try the Larb, it is on happy hour and it even comes in tofu as a veggie option. This one dish alone ($5) at happy hour would make me love this place but there were many more delights that made my visit so great.  I don't drink with dinner but here it was happy hour all day sat, and they had a unique drink the Curry Gimlet, IT comes in a martini glass has a orange hue, it is fruity but has a curry finish from cardamom I assume, truly unique.  Our dishes of Pad See ewe and Dragon noodles were great, and huge portions.   Rich flavors, well textured tofu and crisp veggies.   When I made my reservation I let them know about the birthday of the person I was with. We were surprised with fried banana and ice cream along with a candle and signing it was great!

Pizza with sauce on the side does not quite have the ring that cheesy bread has to it.   We were hanging out by the pool in N Scottsdale and we needed some gluttonous food to go with beer at the swim up bar. Google suggested we call Barro's and that is just what we did.  2 orders of cheesy bread and one pizza. The cheese bread went fast too. It is essentially a pizza with the sauce on the side and cut into handy strips. Yes it was greasy, garlicky and doughy, that is what made it so good.  Delivery was fast and the food was hot.

I think this is the only place in town where I can get gnocchi without unneeded extras.  My least meal here stated with the bruchetta, it was good and full of tomatoes and bail on nicely toasted crustinni, the portion could have been larger but the price was right. For my main course I had the ganocci in a Alfredo like sauce. The texture of the ganocci was spot on, the sauce could have used more flavor. I really would like to see a traditional Gorgonzola cream sauce.  The included bread basket with the meal is quite good, with a sturdy crust and soft and moist body.   I am not sure if I ever got the format right, I always order at the counter, but it would seem some people placed their order with a waiter.  either way the meal is quick and a fair price.  If you go the self service route drinks are in a soda fountain and you can save a few $ on the tip.

I would have named it sushihana but I guess that is why I am not in marketing.  I have been here many times and treated well, Friday night was no exception . When we had arrived it was crowded but the MOD Blake was able to accommodate our group and ensured our first round of drinks made it out in short order.  Their happy hour is pretty good, in addition to many rolls on special they have a few other great items like a seaweed salad. The texture of this salad is quite unique, it is flavored with a sesame ginger dressing.  I was also surprised at the speed that the sushi came considering how busy it was.  They also have many drinks specials including sake bombers for the guys and a Tsunami bowl for the girls.  Overall good deals and great staff like Blake make it one of my favorites on mill to eat or drink at.

WATER!  make sure you try a glass of water here. No, really try it, it is the best tasting water I have ever had. It must be the purified water they use to make the beer and the price is right.  Free water aside, Four peaks in Tempe makes many great beers, some good food and combines it in  a unique industrial warehouse atmosphere.   On my last trip here I went just for the beer, like many other times. I tried the seasonal, all be it after the season, pumpkin ale. It was pretty good with subtle spice notes,a clean finish and not too much residual sugar.   I also had the Hop Knot IPA, the strong hops in this beer have some distinctly fruity and floral notes adding to its' complexity.   After all of that great water and beer, take a trip to the hidden Men's bathroom in the game room, it is a very unique experience.   In north Tempe this is my place of choice to go for a drink.

First tip the whole groupon thing is a sham as the discount, says you need to buy an overpriced drink that would be included with the normal price.  Second issue is the shady location, my wife and I were pan handled numerous times in the small parking lot.   On the upside most of the food was acceptable, but with a catch, the bindi masla was a bit salty and the palak had a bunt taste

I know what I like and it does not often take me long to make up my mind on a menu, however I spent over 8 min decided and could have spent more.  The reason, so many tempting items, I usually just t need to decide between the fish or veggie dish, but here every dish is a veggie dish.  We started our meal with fake crab puffs and samosas.  The crab puffs were great, crispy garlicky and for having no cheese egg or crab lacked nothing. The plate of puffs came with a thimble of sweet dipping sauce, and there were 5 puffs for $3.  The plate of 3 samaos for $4 were not as impressive, there was too much cumin giving it a cinnamon taste, the warper was crisp and not greasy.  For my meal I went with the Thai peanut mock beef with brown rice. $7.50 I was happy to have brown rice as a standard option. The bowl while small had fresh crisp veggies, the sauce was a bit weak but the mock beef was interesting in flavor and texture.  It is order at the counter and they bring it to you style, they have a stage   so it may not be a great for a intimate chat. there is some couch and patio seating.  For drinks there is fountain and new age soda options.  If you are a veggie or follow similar dietary restrictions (halal kosher vegan budist monk etc..) give this place a try

I am still a big fan, Another good rice bowl, and a po-boy this time.  It was the firs time I ever ventured to the sandwich side of the menu wand I was pleased.  We had a Argentinean po boy which was basically mock steak peppers and onions. The mock beef as great,  the veggies were a bit over cooked and the bun was toasted but nothing special for $8.  We did start with the egg rolls, aside from the small noodles inside they were decent as they were fried but not greasy but again nothing special. $4  We also split a "diablo red" bowl $7.50 despite the name we had to add some hot sauce to up the level of diablo to it. The veggies were fresh and well cooked, the mock chicken was great and the brown rice served it's purpose well.    Overall I like the format of this place, and the fact I can order anything on the menu.

This place had the cheapest and best falafil (that is how they spell it) pita of anywhere in town.  The falafel was moist, flavorful the lettuce was fresh and there was a copious amount of sauce to cover it. The pita was a bit thin but that can be over looked. At under $3 it might be worthwhile to get two.   As for the hummous we had on the side, it was a great texture but a bit low on flavor. Make sure you order an extra pita and it comes with just one.   We got the order to go so we did not really have any service to review.    When you first walk in you are assaulted by the smells of many spices and many other alien things to most Americans.   There is an attached small market full of spices, and exotics foods and flavored tobaccos for those under 21 who seek a vice. The counter is full of many types of balaclava and olives.  If you want a great falafel pita at a good price, be brave and stop in. Just leave your Pro Bush / Israel gear in the car.

This is one of my favorite date places to take a nice girl, Note if you are nice girl I have yet to take on a date act surprised when I take you here.  For a date the setup is great. You can park near the town lake and have a nice walk and talk.  Arrive and drop your name for the reservation you made on the phone or online.  Sit in a private area in the back.  Don't commit to one wine she may not like order a flight each, it will give something to talk about and add fun.  Be careful with the bread and olive oil, I have stained a shirt on a date, and it was embarrassing.  For the meal there are many options that even work if you or you date are a vegetarian. I often go for the mushroom ravioli, with the half and half sauce option. The mushrooms are exotic and earthy, the red sauced half is bright and clean, the white cream sauce is rich and flavorful, a dollop of pesto adds a nice touch.  The prices are great for a date too, high enough to not look cheap but low enough to not break the bank.   For 2 wine flights and two meals expect to spend $60ish out the door.  Lightning is great for a date, and on weekends there may be live music even.  So if you want to make a great first impression at reasonable prices, make a reservation and have a great time.

It is always nice to find a place that can make just about any dish with tofu as the main protein. This means a vegetarian like me can choose from any dish on the menu.  Despite this flexibility I tend towards the red curry. I get this as hot as they will make it with out an argument ensuing, which is usually pretty decent on the heat scale. It is a great medley of crisp vegetables in a creamy coconut milk base red curry. The tofu is the fried style which adds an interesting textural variety to the standard tofu.  The lunch specials come with a small salad, a small soring roll and a little slice of watermelon all in the $7 range.   Service is decent, my water received frequent refills as i tend to drink quite a bit with spicy food.   Parking here can be a bit tight at high times, and there also may be s small wait. If there is a wait go to the liquor next store to find an amazing beer selection.

Live near campus? Don't have a back yard? Like to drink? Than Casey Moores might be right for you.   The patio is the main attraction for me. It is like the back yard that I want but am too lazy and cheap to have.   A fire tables, pic nick tables, coy pod with waterfall, outdoor bar and the most unique men's bathroom anyway, more on that later.   As the name would imply there is a Irish theme, and they do have oysters in addition to other standard bar food fare. The food is nothing to brag about.   There is a decent parking lot however this place is popular and you may need to find a spot on a near by block. note go 1 block south to avoid being ticked as the restrictions change.   The outdoor men's bathroom known as the "blarney stone" is great. There is a motion activated waterfall, just unzip your full and donate your beer back to the bar in the most zen fashion available.

It is not new, it is not hip or sheek, but it is casual, and quite good.  Start your meal with the signature bean dip, chips and salsa. In reality this is all you need for a meal but it is polite and delicious to try the other offerings.   I oped for the chile relleno. A large chile stuffed with cheese battered and covered in a rich red sauce and more cheese. What is there not to love.  The red enchilada sauce here is deep and rich it pairs well with the cheese.   So give the old local AZ chain a try I bet you will like it.

Unpretentious, casual but fancy enough for a date family run independent Italian food at a good value.   Hidden in a strip mall next to peiwei you will find papa Razzini's, When you walk in you may notice that the age many of the customers is a bit older.   Your meal will start with complimentary bread and bruchetta, that is right, not butter, or olive oil but diced tomatoes with basil and spices. It's pretty good too; however I would enjoy a bit firmer bread. There is usually a special dish or two on a white board. There are also many vegetarian options on the menu. Dishes are made to order so if one has say pancetta and you don't want that you can ask for it to be omitted.   I usually opt for bow tie primavera, it is a fresh melody of vegetables in a light cream sauce, and I like it with extra garlic. The portion is decent for $10. I also enjoy the penne al la vodka sans pancetta.   I know the 90's are over but I still like the a la vodka sauce. It is a beat cream with a very unique tomato flavor as the vodka converts some tomatoes flavors to soluble ones.   For only $1.50 a small salad can be added to your meal. Service is decent, and the small parking lot view patio works.

Great value, great options and good flavor and done quickly.   Don't mistake this with other fast-ish Asian places this places unique and better.  Many of them items are available with tofu and veggies for `6.25-7.  Stir fry, noodles curry classics and more can be had.  I tried the Singapore noodles, thin noodles with yellow curry and tofu and veggies. The flavor of the curry powder was bright and clean. The garlic sambal this place has was a great compliment.   I also tried the red curry, it was very rich and tick compared to other curries and full of deep flavors.   Service was fast and there was some nice patio seating in addition to the inside. Great for lunch or a fast casual dinner.

It was a rare cloudy day in Phoenix when I visited this place. I was hoping to try what I had been told is some of the spiciest Mexican food in town.  I went despite it being in a dangerous part of town.   My friend and I arrived and the patio looked like a garage sale full of random colorful items cluttered about. Inside was a bit claustrophobic with low ceilings and decorations strewn about the walls.    The tables had odd warnings about children and drink refills that did not seem fitting for a sit down restaurant.   I ordered the Chile relleno plate.  After time our chips and salsa came. the chips were think, heavy and cold. The super hot salsa was not very spicy at all and apparently you only get one bowl as we never received any more, also quite odd for this format.  Our meals came and I was excited to try a spicy Chile however it was quite mediocre lacking much cheese filling or on top. The rice and beans were quite standard too. I would have enjoyed some salsa to put on my rice however they never bought any more.  We paid cash at the front cash register as the waiter will not handle your bill.  Overall this place seemed overpriced, low quality and a bit low brow. Go try Serrano's or Arriba for a better meal.

You may hear the muffled sound of gunfire but do not worry, that is just the adjacent gun shop.  This is the original location, the best location food wise and also one of the more difficult ones to park at without prior knowledge of the location.  For the past decade I have been meeting m family here for weekday lunches when our schedule permit. The key is to get there either before 11:30 to beat the rush to at 12:30 for when they leave.  Our usual meal starts with the Boom Dip, it is a artichoke dip dish but unlike the now popular clone it is artichoke heavy, lighter on the cream and has a nice browned cheese crust on top. It is now served with strips of pizza crust with cheese on it.  I like to eat the dip straight and put chili oil (yes this is a standard table condiment) red pepper and parmagean cheese on the bread.  For the main course, we split a Large Thin Pesto Pizza. The crust is thin and crispy. In lieu of tomato sauce there is their great pesto sauce, large tomato slices and mozzarella cheese finish up the package.  It is cut into square, with the four corner triangles being the best pieces.  The staff is fun friendly and will to accommodate. The patio has many mechanisms in place to make it bearable on hot dry summer days, inside has high top tables and blast loud swing music.    I also enjoy the penne pesto bake, which is now in a bread bowl, pasta, cheese pesto diced tomato more cheese and a bread bowl. It is worth a try.  The Artichoke lasagna is great if you are willing to wait.   For lunch, the pasta dishes include a salad and for dinner, they do not. I do not get it but that is the way it is.

The pyramids were built 3200BC and this is about when the rooms at  the luxor were last updated.  Musty orders, dingy carpet, peeling ceilings, well worn furniture, stained curtains and CRT tvs are some of the relics you will find in this site.  Long slow moving check in lines and slow delivery on requests to the font desk come with the added resort fee.  The one neat thing here is the elevator, after a few drinks going up at a slant is quite interesting.

Mass quantiles are the name of the game when it comes to buffets often at the cost of quality, however this is not the case here.  My friend and I were making a less than sober stagger across the strip when we saw signs for this buffet, and it sounded great. At about $38 with tax it is not cheap.  to me, a person who does not eat meat often buffet's seem like a rip off, but here I felt like I was the bandit.  There is a sushi area, it has your usual rolls, nigiri hand rolls etc. The real star here is the Poke, sliced raw fish tossed with soy sauce, scallions sesame seed oil and spices. usually poke of this quality is a $12 app for a martini glass sized bite. I opted for a full dinner plate of this great plate of raw fish.  Once I cleaned out the sea of all of it's treasures I explored the rest of the buffet. Artisan cheese plate, bok choy, quinoa, and many other gourmet items could be found.  My friend really enjoyed the kobe beef, it may have been a function of his BAC.  The dessert section also has many tasting sized bites great for allowing the maximum amount of flavors to be had.

I stooped in for a Friday lunch with my boss. Parking was a bit of a pain as usual. The only table available was in direct sunlight and it kept us squinting though our entire conversation.   The lunch menu consists entirely of sandwiches and salads. I was in the mood for some hot food, this along with my love affair of cheese lead me to try the hot multi cheese sandwich. I did not know what to expect as on the menu it sounded like a grilled cheese sandwich.  My arrived on a plate with a small side of Cesar like salad.  The salad had a nice topping of shaved Parmesan, and the sandwich had a generous amount of micro greens in addition to the cheese. The micro greens gave the sandwich a nice bitterness to contrast the fattiness of the cheese. The crunch and slight char taste of the brick oven chibata style bread tied the entire thing together.  My bosses meal came on a old chipped plate, as if the kitchen had run out of the nice contemporary plates. This was troublesome as it was against health code. His meal of a cold meat sandwich and fruit salads looked appetizing as well.    I look froward to returning at night to try their pizza again.

Despite the name my girlfriend would not let me wear my Fez to dinner. Even without the fun hat it was a great meal.  Walk in and you are greeted with a modern contemporary interior and a patio that has some of the best views of the light rail on central. The patio does have heaters for the 4 months of winter.   The menu consists of salads, burgers, and some entree`s. We started with the full Marrakech salad 9.99. What was nice was the fact I split this with my girlfriend and they served it on two separate plates. This is great as it saves us from dropping a third on the table while we try to split; it also restricts my selfish nature and ensures my girlfriend gets some food. The salad itself was nice fresh spinach, orange supremes and a light dressing.   Our mains consisted of the Veggie burger 9.99 with sweet potato fires and mixed greens and the apricot Salmon. 17.95. The burger was great, soft moist and full of flavor, the fries were crisp but it bit too desert like with the cinnamon.   Our salmon was cooked perfectly, and the cous cous was light and fluffy. The apricot glaze was sweet but not overpowering.  For desert we had the tarimsu. Again marvelous light decadent and nicely dusted with coco powder that I got on my sleeve.  Service was great just as the food was.

From the moment I walked in the door I was smiling.   The initial shock of the dim inside may be a bit much from the South facing doors but lets your eyes adjust and you will be amazed.   The front row is all of the new stern machines, rom versions are often listed. Go down the isles and see classic machines, and other unique machines with a small story write up about them.  Enjoy the non pinball items from classic pong and punchout arcade games to claw grabber and ski ball.  Hungry  $.25 buys a bag of popcorn form a neat old machine. Thirsty? There is a modern drink despiser.  Need quarters? There are three or more change machines that give real quarters not  tokens.   Their site has a full list of machines. Most are well maintained and fully functional.

Some things are just better when done outside, this includes dining on the great patio at Chelsea's Kitchen  During my visit I did not see Chelsea, if she is even real,  however I did see the kitchen and most importantly, I sat on the vine covered patio complete with a fireplace.  Our meal started  out with the seasonal specialty, a yellow tomato with 12 year old balsamic, goat cheese and sea salt ($10) This dish was decent, the tomato was firm however I would have liked to have had a bit more goat cheese. I always thought yellow tomatoes were not ripe yet, however this proved otherwise.  The ahi taco platter was too alluring to resist, keeping it somewhat healthy I opted for the veggies in lieu of the rice and beans. The high grade fish was seared perfectly, the guacamole was good as was the pico. The Veracruz veggies were just so so, as were the small handmade rough corn tortillas I was excited for.  Come in, enjoy the patio and the food.

I guess the lucky cat was watching over my meal because was good.   I recommend you orient yourself with the menu when you first go in as there are many tempting options. They have typical Chinese chaffing dish foods and a beautiful array vegetables for their build your own stir fry.   Unlike other  BYO stirfry places the sauces, and protein amounts are prefix. There are several sauce options, a dizzying array of vegetables and some great julienned firm tofu.   Once you fill your bowl, you drop it off for cooking. Once it is cooked you name is called, and you pick up your bowl plus which now has rice in addition to the meat veggies and sauce. There are small bowls of won ton chips available as well as a good array of condiments.   To go boxes are also free which will be needed for most people.   Friendly helpful staff is there to assist with ordering and water refills.

I'm back! is what I proclaimed as I walked through the door. However the longer line just gave me an odd look.  This trip I decided to take my entire team, which ranged from Chinese food pros, to a recent grad from Montana who had to ask me what half of the veggies were.  Overall we had a good trip, our food was good, the service was pleasant and overall it was a good value. Because it was a busy Friday it did take longer for our food to cook than expected. Also we got the last parking spot in the lot, if we were a few minutes later I don't know what we would have done.  I opted for the make you own stir fry with kungpow sauce. I recommend when filling your bowl you skip the broccoli until later as it just takes up excess space at the bottom. I went heavy on the tofu and pea pods this time. The food came nuclear hot so it did take some time for it to cool down enough to eat.  My coworkers were surprised by the volume of food and they seemed to enjoy their shezuan beef and chicken dishes.   I am not the food authority at the office, if some one is going out they now ask me where to go thanks to my recommendation of this place for lunch.

Corporate blandness redeemed by many vegetarian options.  With a name like yard house and the huge beer selection one might overlook the food here on first thought as I did. I was wrangled to go here on a triple date.   On first glance at the menu I saw the usual burgers, salads and sandwiches one would expect. But I also saw a section called Gardein, which has menu faux chicken veggie items. From faux wings, rice bowls, pizzas and salads all with fake Gardein chicken.  WE started with two orders of the Gardein wings $9.95 each. One order buffalo and one Jerk. The jerk ones were a bit bland but had a nice fried crust to them so they were satisfying. The Buffalo ones were a bit soggy from the sauce but overall a nice app.  For my main I selected the Ahi Tuna Sandwich 13.95 Seared very rare. It comes with a pencil holder of thin fries. The fries were good but a bit cool when they arrived, not the freshest. The Tuna was nicely rare and a pink color as it was not a the best sashimi grade. All together it did not work as the caramelized onions and Swiss over powered the tuna. Dismantle the sandwich, eat the tuna with soy and then the bread with the cheese, tomato, spinach alone and it works as two good mains.   My date had the Gardein rice bowl, (11.95)  the name is apt as it was mostly rice, with a generic soy based sauce, and mixed veggies. It was decent and nice it was on the menu but not gourmet, it needed some spice and less rice more vegies.   I also did like the fact they had a local seasonal beer on tap (4 peaks pumpkin porter)  It was also nice they could split an app 3 ways with no issue at all. So bring in a group and paying will not be the usual headache.

My first visit here was long over due. I had heard the legend of this Asian Mexican fusion cuisine. On first visit I was a bit confused about how and what to order as there are several combo and meal options to choose from, luckily they have helpful staff and I was sober. For me a vegetarian there are 2 main options, the Chile rellno or the veggies. I have only tried the chilie rellno in all forms. On my first visit I got a combo which allows you to pick any two items and get each one in either a burrito or quesadilla. I opted for one of each.  With the combo comes rice of several choices and beans. I recommend the Cuban style beans as they are full of great flavor.  To spice things up be sure to take a copious amount of their hot sauce. It  has a great spice with a slightly sweet note.   I got my meal to go so I had to wait a few minuets to see what I had actually ordered.  The first appearance was very greasy and somewhat disorganized in a small round pan. One bite later and I was hooked. The textures and flavors were incredible. The batter on the Chile is very unique and it must have cornflakes and or French fried onions to add that special crunch.  I was very satisfied with my meal, it was affordable  (less than $8) great tasting and very filling.  To my surprise the bag contained two free cookies!   I will be going back when I have a chance. My friend who I was with shares the same opinion. I just will have to work out a bit more as this is not exactly healthy food.

They force you into the Million calorie combo.  A rice bowl is not quite enough and by time you add bans its just $..30 more for the big combo.  I finally got a chance to come back in here, I did a to go order for lunch. It was made quickly. I still have no idea how to fill out the order sheet, and despite the a sign on the door saying the use that sheet in the kitchen.   As usual my food was great as it should be with all of the cheese and fried bits.   The hot sauce lacked some of the sweetness that I usually like, the color was even off  bit this time.  I was beyond full after this meal, it made me contemplate picking up bulimia.

This place has been talked about both good and bad for many years. Mainly the bad due to poor health scores. At last check they still don't even want to participate for a letter grade and seems to have a consistent stream of mildly concerning health issues.   Being a veg place I figured, that even a few health issues can't kill me, at worst I would get some good quality time with a book so we gave it a try.  We started with the Gobi manchurian, It is listed under dishes but it works best as an appetizer. This dish is great and their execution worked quite well. We had a massive dosa which was great with the many dipping sauces. We also had a vegetable vindaloo that was forgettable.   Over all the food was good and no one got sick. Prices are on part with any sit down indian place.  The ambiance is a bit odd

Pizza, salad, beer and a burger, sounds generic enough however there are a few things that make this place shine.  The beer at $6 pint is is not cheap but bring a growler and for $12 you can get 4 beers as long as you don't mind just one type. For wine they have an attached market with okish prices again they sell the wine with the pizza for the same price (score).  The Pizza it self, thin crust cooked in a open  fire oven. The mushroom party was the best party in my mouth or elsewhere. Sweet caramelized onions  along with a mix of mushrooms and cheese made for a real hit. The avocado pizza was unique but I found the rich avocado to be a bit overpowering for the crust.   The salads were all good that may be due to the large amount of dressing on them.   Ambiance, is like any other trendy place, a bit too loud and maybe a bit too dim, -I really sound  old.

In short an unimpressive independent Italian restraint in a overly Italian saturated area.  Over the years this location has changed names and ownership many times, and I decided to give the current iteration of this place a try. The inside has gone upscale, with frescos on the wall, table cloths, and an accordion player. The empty buffet setup by the window did not quite match.  The menu has "hand made pastas" and many traditional dishes, pizzas, sandwiches and strombolis.   Included with a main dish is a side salad with choice of dressing and garlic bread. I opted for the ravioli de zuca 15.95, butternut squash ravioli in a white cream sauce. I was hoping the gorgonzola the menu listed would be more pronounced however it was not. The filling was quite sweet, the pasta was a bit soft and the meal was luke warm at best when it reached my table. The side salad was good with a nix mix of greens and I had a unique jalapeno ranch that was thin and light.   The people I was with ordered a rolled eggplant filled with ricotta cheese (13.95), it came with pasta and veggies. Texturally it was a bit soft and the flavors were weak.   Portion sizes were on the medium side, not huge, but not terribly small, for the price and quality I would have expected more. The garlic bread that is in included is good, as is the on table parmegean cheese, red pepper, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  There are other better options within 3 miles so I say give them a try first.

Great, flavor, Great Value, Great selection with an interesting format.  Go up to the water cooler, grab a cup of water and a sushi style menu and pick out some chatt. Don't forget to look at the specials board or you may have regrests like I did.  We had a mixed chatt, which was a little of everything in salty, sour, crunchy, starchy, creamy, spicy flavor firecracker mix. all for $3.49  I could not resist the Chole Baturah, fired bread with garbanzo beans in a masala sauce and fresh onion. The bread was soft and crisp with out being greasy. And again the flavors were extremely vibrant.   We also had bada paav which is served like a burger, but it is an Indian flavored poto kanish in bread, paleo dieters be ware.  This is not the best 1st date place, but a great place to show your local knowledge and adventure as you are sitting in the aisles of a grocery store and may have some one picking out items over you table. Not to worry every one is very friendly.  Everything here is vegetarian and it is not hard to even be vegan.

I guess this part of town is becoming little Italy as this is just one of 6 or so Italian options in the area.  This is a locally owned non chain. As of late their bar at happy hour seems to be the place to be.  I have gone here for both lunch and dates. For lunch the place is strangely empty and it can be a bit awkward, but decent.  For dates it is great, the dining room has a classy quiet atmosphere. The bread with the sun dried tomato butter is great.   If you hear about a special that sounds good ask the price as I was surprised by my $32 mahi mahi special on one trip. It was good however.  I typically opt for the ganocci al la vodka sans chicken. The al la vodka sauce is bright and has a luxurious mouth feel. The Gnocci have a great texture, with a nice chewy firmness that one expects in them.  The parking lot can get a bit crowed, so you may need to park closer to  Kohles.

What shoes should I wear? Seriously I am going out so I can't wear sneakers or sandals but I don't want sand on my nice shoes. What to do.  First off I have never eaten the food here. I usually come to hang out with friends and have drinks.    First who has a outdoor patio in AZ with out mist and big fans?  The beers and other drinks are a bit pricey.  After 10 there is a cash only cover charge so they can evade paying tax on it.  In general nothing great at all.

It is a big hot pocket!  At least that is how I tried to describe it to my friend before we went tonight.   My friend and I went there tonight for a to go order, to take to our new favorite brewery.  There is no to go order area so we just sat at the bar seating. It took a few minutes for us to decide and just as long for us to be asked what we wanted.   It was one of the rare occasions where deciding was hard, there is an entire vegetarian section of their menu. I went the Veggie Mexican, complete with spicy soy, eggs, cheese and potatoes.   Once you hold a pasty in your hand you can feel the heft and how it will be a filling me. Each bite was full of spicy and savory flavors. The potatoes added a nice texture contrast to the soft eggs and soy.   My friend had the bangers and mash, which he thoroughly enjoyed.  We did have a side of garlic chips (fries) they were neither needed nor great.   Parking right in front can be tight but there is parking in the rear and easy access to the back door.

There are two tricks here. Show up early, and the car bombs are only $3.  My friends and I came in for dinner before a concert. We arrived to a empty place at 5:35 by 6:00 all but a few seats were taken. Keep in mind that this place is quite small.  This go around I went more traditional with veggie oggie. $7 It is filled with veggie steak, potatoes, rutabaga and onion. It was pretty good but not as filling as the Mexican.  For sides my friend got the baked beans, it come looking like a French onion soup, capped with a large clump of melted cheddar in a small cast iron dish. The Beans them self are nothing to special.  Custom pasties are not really an option with their long prep time FYI  On a small note I also like the metal plates, metal is just a great substance.

It must be good, as I keep coming back. They have a great veg selection, it is cheap, and it tastes great, and makes a good to go food. If only it were healthier.  My last trip here was another to go, and good thing too as there were no tables and only single bar seats.  I went  with the salmon pasty, it has everything I like in it, asparagus, potato and of course salmon. It comes with  dill mayo sauce.  My experience told me that fish does not do well in baked formats like this, and I was right, to bake the dough the fish ends up over cooked and dry. Luckily the Dill sauce was able to remedy that.   While this pasty it self was not the best I will be back again to try yet another.

New, bigger but Better?  Gone are the days of long waits to sit in a subway car's width to dine, the next two store fronts and patio are now part of the cornishpasty co.   As time goes on some this place move a bit more upscale, lighting so dim I was blind for the firs Prices have gone up about a dollar or two since the early days.   One thing that has not changed is the great pasties.

Still a very solid choice for Thai in the South Tempe / Chandler.  This time we tried a the pad woo sen, which their rendition of it was truly great with the fine noodles veggies and tofu. The one surprise is that this dish even came with rice even though it is a noodle dish. I do like it when they ask if egg is ok when ordering with tofu and veggies.  The panang curry we had was rich and full of spice, if you are not in to spicy this may not be the fish for you.

I think my family from Brooklyn would be offended with the vain use of their borough's name for sub standard pizza.  I went here for a late lunch with a coworker looking to try something new. When we walked in at 1pm it was dead, they seemed excited to have us as customers and were happy to show us how their lunch specials worked.  I opted for a single slice of cheese pizza, my usual test case for a pizza place.  My coworker went for the lunch special that included a small side salad and a fountain drink.   My pizza was not fresh, and a bit too soggy and floppy, I made liberal use of the red peeper, Parmesan and black pepper to cover up what the pizza lacked in flavor.  There was a popcorn machine in the back with free popcorn, however it seemed empty and infrequently visited.  They do have many special on beer, and i think the only time this place is busy is before and after a basketball game at the adjacent arena.

Even half off the value was just terrible and I left hungry. I have been here several times with a friend who works for the parent corporation and gets 1/2 off our bill.   With the discount I felt I could try a bit more and started my meal with an appetizer. I had the Ahi Poke, similar to a caviche small cubes of ahi came in a martini glass seasoned with some soy and garnished with a wasabi mayo. It was good but quite small.   For my meal I selected the "Roy's classic trio" consisting of Hibachi Grilled Salmon, Roy's Original Blackened Island Ahi & Hawaiian Style Misoyaki Butterfish. It came out with 3 small I mean small plates in a tasting style display. The Ahi was great, the spices went well with the cool raw interior. The Butter fish was nice too with a sweet miso glaze on a bed (or pillow in this case) of black rice. I thought the salmon was a bit over cooked. After I had finished the three 2oz tastings I was still hungry.   I am probably not the only one with this opinion as on both weekday visits we were one of two tables.   I think if they want to increase the plate count they should lower the prices and or up the portion size.

How can I politely say that all this place has is "chick food."   I have been here several times, and tried their limited vegetarian options. I found that the one with the mos flavor was the grilled feta. The feta gave it a nice flavor however the basil was lacking as were the tomatoes. It was original to use a fresh cheese like feta for a grilled cheese.  The meal includes chips and a side. I usually go for th pasta salad as it is the most filling. The flavor of the salad is bland and I usually empty half of a pepper shaker into it.   I have tried to spice up my food with the Italian dressing that is found on each table. I found it best to turn the bottle upside down and let the oil separate out, this way you can get just spices and vinegar, it goes well on the chips.   Overall the meals here are a bit pricey for the lack of flavor and portions.

If it is a fried food than you will find it here.  I went here after some convincing from some co workers. Yes, it is in an old pizza hut. Yes there was a used condom in the parking lot, and yes the garbage truck drivers seem to frequent this place.  For the low price of $7 with a drink access to a buffet full of random "delights"   There is a salad side, with some salad that I have yet to see any one touch and macaroons, not Chinese last I checked but they have them near the salad.  The center buffet area is the fried foods annex. Greasy egg rolls, uncross and greasy cream cheese puffs, fried bananas, French fries, dough nuts, fried fish and even pizza. None of them are stellar, most are even below bar.  Another row contains the Chinese foods. The vegetarian options are limited to a mass of bean sprouts, veggie lomein noodles and the rices.   Finally, there is the desert area, full of jellos and pineapple cubes, and pudding, and of course fortune cookies. I was also a bit disappointed that they re use siriacha sauce bottles for other sauces, as I would love to have siriacha with any food.  While the eclectic mix of food is comical, the overall result is just mass quantities of subpar food.   If you are starving and need to raise your cholesterol, a few points this place may be for you. If you like quality look elsewhere.

I went here with a friend for lunch looking to try something different. We knew it would be a bit awkward for us gringos walking into a place that is geared towards Asians with foul hanging in the window.  To be seated we were asked if we were there for lunch or dim sum, we said lunch and were escorted to the cheap seats.  Upon viewing the menu, I realized there were virtually no vegetarian options. The only thing I saw was the fried tofu.  The included egg drop soup was not vegetarian either.    When my meal finally came, it was not what I expected. It was basically nine battered and fried pieces of tofu with rice on the side. Despite looking quite good, the batter was devoid of any flavor, and the tofu was extremely soft which was not the ideal texture.   This meal was not too cheap either and I left hungry. At least for lunch this is far from being on my list of places to go.  PS this is not a buffet despite the name

You better have a range rover, Cayenne or other luxury SUV when rolling in to this Costco.  In addition to the usual Costco fare this location carries a selection of high end items. Notable items are very high end watches like a $27999 Cartier watch, the elusive kirkland scotch, high end reserve bottles of wine, bags of frozen Ahi Tuna and Empire Kosher chicken breasts.    Parking can be tough to come by on the weekends here, I often go with my older parents who get VIP handicapped parking.  The biggest negative about this location is the food court hot dogs, they are not Hebrew national. They are Kirkland brand.  Not this costco also has a automated car wash for $7.99 bit pricey but seems to do a good job.

While headed home to Florence Italy a talented chef got a bit lost and ended up in Florence AZ. This is my hypothesis  of how this great place came to be.  I for one did not expect to find such a great place so far off the beaten path.  Walk in and you find a counter to order at and a classic menu board full of Italian classics from pizza, spaghetti, lasagna, salads and more.  I went with the classic two slices of cheese ($2 each). The crust was ideal soft with a slight crispness to the bottom, the sauce was great full of flavor and not sweet or acidic. The cheese was nicely melted however I would have liked it to be cooked slightly more.  My coworkers dishes came with a roll on the side which I tried part of.  It was very soft, and great. They also enjoyed their meals.  They do have a $5.99 2 slices of peperoni and a fountain drink deal. They also have a small selection of items to buy near the entrance, artisan pastas etc. There is also a coffee bar and nice patio here too.

I like variety in life, to get the variety I crave I visits Costcos other than the one that is a mile from my house. This is what brought me to Candler today.  As costcos go this one can get quite busy on the weekends, its proximity to a major mall, and two highways make it a popular destination.   The item selection here is pretty standard with a few nicer liquors on occasion.  I love most things Costco, so I will focus on what makes this a less than perfect Costco.   The gas station entrance is a bit odd, as you must snake through the parking lot. Moreover, the food court table layout is terrible, long rows with little space in-between; it is anything but private dining.   I also am bothered by the fact they often have garbage blocking the suggestion box, I wonder if this is an attempt to discourage suggestions.  This location is relatively new so the store layout is the new entrance on the left exit on the right.

The right tool for the job really helps. As with many jobs however I only do them once in a blue moon. The tools here are cheap enough to make it worth while to buy it.  My friends and I have a joke, everything sold  here eventually becomes a hammer. It is true just about everything is made in chine and may not last more than a few uses, but often that is enough.  If you see a coupon price in a mailer be sure to bring it with you as the in store ads do not have the coupons.  Typically I avoid the power tools and stick to the hand tools, jack stands and miscellaneous items.  If you need a tool, and rather save some cash instead of handing it down to your kids check out Harbor Freight.

They don't sell any racks, but what they do sell surprised me.  I walked in and was greeted by a case of watches contain some decent movado and TX watches and the prices were pretty good too. More surprising was the fact the sales person knew about the TX watch, and obscure offshoot of timex.  I also found they they have one of the best hat selections around and I was quite pleased to find a nice hat and it was just $20.  I noticed with much of the clothing and shoes that even at 1/2 off it can still be a bit steep with the high starting prices.  75% of the store floor space is allocated to womens clothing and I can not comment much on that.  The one thing I did hate was the checkout line, I hate lines and it seemed awkwardly placed.

First note the Costco food court only accepts cash. With that said it takes very little cash to have a great meal. I stop in here frequently for a quick lunch or dinner. The hot dog and a soda combo is only $1.62 with tax. That includes a Hebrew National all beef jumbo hot dog and a fountain drink with free refills. There are also free toppings for your hot dog including onions sour kraut and the usual ketchup and mustard. If you are feeling more adventurous there are polish sausages available as well.  If a hot dog is not your fancy there is pizza by the slice or by the pie. If you wish to have a veggie pizza you must buy an entire pie. This pizza is decent with a sturdy crust and generous amounts of toppings. The slices are quite large and once can would be a sufficient meal.   for desert there are many great options, there is a incredible hand dipped ice cram bar covered in a thick shell of chocolate with optional free nuts. Frozen yogurt can be had in chocolate or vanilla or with berries for just a bit more. There is the famous churro, no longer must you go to Disneyland or Mexico for this Latino delight. There are also mocha and berry smoothies that challenge the offerings of the best coffee shops.   Dining is pick nick style, first come first serve at the tables. There is an additional seating annex with great window views of Tempe.

I just stopped in tonight after the gym, I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap.  It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close. This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush. It was empty, and the lines were short.  Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me.

The aroma of a dining place can be a great advertisement, or a way to scare people away.    This place falls in the the latter as there was a strong smell of sewage here.  Smell aside I decided to sit outside and risk my stomach to bring you this review.  We had a veggie yakisoba $6, which was a bit dry but the veggies were not overcooked. The flavor was alight but not great. We also had a veggie bowl, overly steam unoriginal veggies over white rice and an sweet sauce $4.   I was unimpressed in may ways.  The ambiance is a bit depressing. There is a ATM covered by a trash bag, that bad smell, and a menu that looks like they printed at kinks and taped it over the failed franchise that once occupied this location.

Sure lets try throwing that on a pizza, why not.  That is the approach taken at Picazzo's.  While they do offer  a mundane Margarita pizza on the menu here, that is not the thing to try. As far as their crust it is decent but far from perfect.  One of my favorite pizzas is the quarto fomarggi, (four cheeses for the Italian challenged) has Gorgonzola cheese, Alfredo, mozzarella, cherve (goat) and Fontina. the high fat of the fonina makes a smooth melt right into the Alfredo while the pungent cherve and strong flavor of the Gorgonzola are quite present. This is topped with basil and pears that really complement the mould cheese.  The inside of the location is decent, it mostly has tables a few booths and a new expanded bar. There also is a large patio with parking lot views for the cooler weather.

There is something black in my drink! oh wait that is just Boba.  If you have never experienced Boba you may not be too apatized based on the description. Boba is black flavorless tapioca pearls in some kind of drink, often a tea or milk mixed with juice. I often opt for the exotic fruit milk teas like lychee or passion fruit to avoid the caffeine. The cup is  hermetically sealed and you are give a extremely girthy straw to drink it with. The straw is think enough to accommodate Boba beads going up it.   It is not for every one, but it is unique, fun and relatively cheap. This place has a few sofas, a fish tank and a computer for the Internet. However I usually take my drink and go to the adjacent Asian supermarket and marvel at the unique and strange food items as I enjoy my drink.  Some times there are special drinks, I once had a avocado smoothie sans boba, and no it was not just guacamole with a straw. It was surprisingly good and sweet.   Give it a try, or two as it is a unique change from the usual cofee shop.

I still love this place.  Big fish tank, free internet kiosk, a couch, and of course a wide boba selection.  I am a food adventure and I like odd flavors, however I met my match. The red bean milk tea was just too odd for me. It tasted like one mixed ice cream with old bowl of chili beans. The texture was just off, and just thinking about it brings back a weak stomach.  Go for a any thing you think would be in a drink milk juice, like strawberry or coffee and it will be good.   Don't forget to get boba in it otherwise why did you even come? The soft squishy tapioca bads ad a fun texture contract to a drink. They are a bit softer than gummy bears and have no real flavor.

If you want to shop at whole foods on a trader Joe's budget this is your place.  Organic, local, bulk, GMO free they have most of your buzz words covered.   They also have a very large selection of dietary supplements, with decent prices. This includes some items that are hard to find elsewhere.  I enjoy the bulk food for snacks, but I do question how sanitary it is.  Next time you are in the area check it out, its a great store.

If I were in need of meth or crack I would upgrade my rating, alas I go for sugar-free fosters and not drugs.  This is the problem out of my past 10 visits only once was the sugar free foster operational. Another issue is the shortages of 40oz cups. Why pay the same price for a 32 oz  as a 40, oh yes they ran out of cups again.  If you are in to illicit drugs, or low quality prostitutes than you may want to visit this location. I have witnessed several drug deals take place in plain sight in the parking lot, and my co worker was solicited by prostitutes her on numerous occasions.  Unless you are in dire need of a soft drink and can not drive another mile do not come here.

The falafel here was a Big Fat Greek disappointment.  They were dry and flavorless and the pita lacked any real frills.  We were here with a large group which they accommodated quite well and our split checks did have a 18% auto grad on them.   The menu has many meat free options, but I felt it was my duty to review every falafel in town, and at $7 with salad or fries it was one of the better values on the menu. My plate came with three large falafel patties inside a peta (its not pita here) with a side of taziki and a small "Greek" salad on the side. While the falafel was large, it was hard to eat with out breaking it up, and it was terribly dry and devoid of much flavor.  In summary go somewhere else unless you have a large group and need consistent mediocrity of a big chain.

Best Falafel pita in town with the best falafel in it!   Name name says Bakery and Deli, but it is really a cafe with a market.  The menu is posted on the wall above the counter you order at, it has many items plates, pitas and more.   I went with my middle eastern usual, a falafel pita ($5.49) It comes stuffed in a round 6-7 inch pita with some hummus, tahini, lettuce a tomato slice and some onion. The real star here is the fresh crunchy, small falafel balls that are moist and packed with flavor. The hummus completes this flavor package while the tomato onion and lettuce are just along for the ride. The pita is soft and fresh..  My only complaint is at 5.49 is it about $1 more than a good value.   My coworkers went with a few different plates that included chicken, rice salad and a pita, they also enjoyed their food.  When we left there were no free tables so get here before 12.

It may be hard to find at night but it is worth the search. Note the sign here does not light up, and it is a bit small, Look for the big Durant's sign to turn in at.   Walk in and you will find a modern trendy ambiance, blue lighting, local abstract art and large IKEA mirrors. Lighting is a bit low but acceptable, it would make a great date spot.  The menu has salads, Panini, and some entre items for your mains. I went with the south west salmon $16.95 one of the pricier items on the menu.  It was pretty good, well-cooked nice flavors and a decent portion, it comes on a bed of slaw and salsa with a few fried zucchini sticks on top.   We also ordered a side of pesto risotto, it was fabulous, cheesy and full of basil and sundried tomato goodness.  For our other main we had the La Rojeta Panini, (the veggie goat cheese sandwich) 9.95. It was nothing special but I did appreciate the cerve` with every bite. It came with a small side Ceaser salad that was heavy on the cheese but a bit light on the quality of the romaine.  One little neat thing is the way you order and pay, the server has a i-pod touch which even has pictures of each dish, you even hold it to pay at the end, this way your card never leaves your sight.

Should a food be authentic or taste good?  Ideally both but I lean towards taste and things were tasting good.  I was here for happy hour 5-6:30 on a Sat night which is rare to have a happy hr on a sat night. Happy hr prices are not bad but not a bargain, Basic rolls are $4 and fancy rolls are $8.25  the veggie tempura is a decent deal at $4 as are long islands.  I had a las vegas roll, which here is made with avocado and smoked salmon, far from usual but the smokiness of the salmon with the fattiness of the avocado work so well. The spicy tuna was good but nothing special. I tried a piece of my friends cowboy roll which is smothered in a chipotle mayo and quite pleasing.   Sure this makes sushi less healthy, and not very authentic but it was good and the prices were eh ok at happy hour.  The music was a bit loud but I could still converse with my friends.

They have an app for their on tap beer menu, and it is usually correct. This alone is cool. Add to that the bike friendly indoor parking and nice staff service and I like this place.  If you are looking for a laid back local school / nieghborhood type bar this should be your spot. Large selection of craft beer and a decent menu, but I was just here for drinks.

It was minutes before a long flight, and I was quite mad at the airline, I figured what better way to get even than the aromas and after effects of a huge burrito!  I was surprised how busy this little store front was on a Saturday at 7. It is not fancy, it is a step above your average berto/beto experience. There is a large menu on the wall that takes a bit of time to get a handle on. there is indoor and a large patio for seating.   I went with the fish burrito that some of my fan boyrito friends suggested.  less than $5  My burrito came the tortilla was soft yet had a nice crust from grilling, the burrito had a sufficient amount of fried fish, lettuce and the fresh taste from peppers and onions. It came with some nice thinker chips. There is a salsa bar with some great salsa to compliment the chips but to my chagrin no drinkable picante style sauces.  Also note they are moving soon to a remodeled KFC in the same complex so the patio arrangement may change.  There was quite a wait conciderign the natrue of this plaace,

Great food decent ambiance and fair prices, why is this place not packed?  WE started with the fool, a warm mix of mashed garbanzo beans, seasonings topped with onions and tomato it was great.  For the main dish we went with the vegetarian musaka, which is eggplant in a red sauce. on't confuse this with an Italian dish, as the flavors are very different  It comes with a well cooked long grain rice which compliments it nicely.

I just got back from lunch here with a co worker, and yes I am writing this instead of working, but come on its Friday.   From the external appearance I was unsure as it is not in a bright, shiny  and new building, the interior looked like a old diner meets cliche Chinese food.   As soon as we took our seats were were served some cabbage soup that  had a good amount of flavor, and a crispy small veggie spring roll that was not too greasy.  I oped for the Spicy (Drunken) noddles. I was very happy that they let me get tofu instead of chicken. This was a great dish, an abundant mix of vegetables, home made style flat noodle pieces and some of the best tofu I have ever had in a delightfully light and spicy sauce. The tofu was Julianneed and well fried to give it a very firm texture and interesting mouth feel.   My co-worker's Teriaki chicken was not as great, but who orders Japanese food at a Thai place and expects it to be stellar.   For a lunch the price of 7.95 was a bit steeper than I would have liked.  There is a bar top with stool for those who wish to dine solo, and great views of the Phoenix art museum out the window. There is ample parking in the adjacent lots.

A word to the wise, at a Thai place order Thai, you will be rewarded.  I went in with a few coworkers for my birthday lunch. I went with the Drunken Tofu noodles again as I have yet to find a place with a dish this good.  The sauce is just amazing, lite with great flavors that pop in addition to a nice spice level. The wide homemade style noodles are a favorite and the Julianned tofu has a nice texture.  The lunch special for $7.99 includes soup and a spring roll (with the soup) which is $1-2 higher than I would like.  A co worker ordered a Chinese dish, it looked fine but nothing special. If you come in go for the Thai food.  I also found this trip the condiment section with chili oil and siriacha sauce, but surprisingly I did not use either as the spicing here was spot on and did not need it.

I finally tired another dish. The Panag Curry with tofu. It was great too. Rich thick curry crisp veggies and tons of flavor.  One thing I am upset with its the new $1 fee to use a credit card for bills that are less than $10. So get a drink or bring cash...

They have fish, a good selection of it and decent quality.  I have been to other locations of this chain, was was not expecting too much for my lunch.  We starked with the ahi poke which was decent, could have used a little wasbi to enhance the flavors.  I shared a bit of the grilled artichoke appetizer, which for being healthy was great.   For my main I had the Seared Ahi Tuna $16.95 with 2 sides. The tuna was surprisingly great, thick, no sinuousness at all great color and flavor. The sides selection is also quite impressive and one can even have a small salad as one of the sides.  You can't avoid some of the chain quirks, like why am i given tartar sauce with seared ahi, and not soy and wasabi / ginger  Service was decent given our large group, and the ambiance is a notch above family casual, I would call it business casual.   Overall it is not a cheap meal, but good fish rarely is.

Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even late night, it is a good time for Amados.  the menu is pretty standard for a Arizona Mexican food shack, the beauty is in the execution. From the beans made with vegetable shortening to the tangy neon green guacamole and bold shredded cheese all of the flavors here POP!  This place also excels when it comes to condiments, There is an amazing red sauce, a very spicy tomatillo green sauce, fresh sliced jalapenos, a cabbage pico de gallo, peeled and sliced cucumbers and spicy carrots.   Last trip I had an old favorite a bean burrito, A pleasantly warm and soft tortilla wrapped some great beans, prodigious application of red sauce made it a great meal.  My friend opted for his usual, carne asada fries. Basically chili cheese fries done the Mexican way.  The place it self is not the fanciest, and there are signs of abuse from the hordes of highschoolers that descend to this place late on weekends. I was one of them just a decade or so go. Time may has passed but I still enjoy the quality value food at Amados.

Cold, under done chips. If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having. Every table had chips and salsa on it. Sombreros were used as the server platters. Senor I don't think this even meets health code.   Dinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called "fandito." I can't think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights.   I like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad.

Great buffet but the price does hurt a bit. I dropped about $30 for two at the buffet with out drinks for a Thursday lunch.  In addtion to the normal dishes one would expect there are dosas and even mini batura  The flavors were bold and declious, service was good too.   I would be back but at about $2-5 more than other lunch buffets I probblay may not be for a long time.

Newest location, same formula, ever growing prices.  I have allays liked YC's, Where else can a get a tofu, veggie, noodle stir fry spiced as highly as I want, with a portion large enough to feed me for two meals.  This new location is clean and efficient like their south Tempe location. The price of a large bowl is up to $9.10  and dogie bags are still $.50 a pop.  Some items have vanished from the food line, like baby corn,  and water chess nuts, both of which are missed.  If you are going for the first time, be sure to pile your food high and pack it in the bowl and to use alot of sauce, the will let you take a 2nd bowl just for sauce if you ask, and I recommend doing that.

The weather was perfect and the need for beer was evident, the patio at San tan was the perfect answer.  I went here with a Friend for a late night beer. The patio was open with heat lamps and we were quickly seated on the patio.  I went with the seasonal coffee stout, the waitress warned me that it was "heavy" which just reaffirmed my decision. My beer came and it had a Nice rich head, the coffee note was very strong and evident with out being bitter. The beer had a clean almost watery body and aftertaste. If you often drink guinness draught you would know what I mean. For a stout there was a real lack of hops, it was closer to a coffee porter.  My friend had a hefewizen, he really enjoyed the clean citrus notes in the beer.  The waitress was nice and even discussed the beers with us it was a decent trip.

Don't let the name fool you, not one dish on the menu has elephant in it, and even when you ask they don't have any off the menu.   Due to the lack of elephant I went with my new thai usual, Drunken noodles with tofu. (7.95) with soup and a veggie spring roll. The soup was good and very strong from copious amounts of ginger. My noodles were good, but they were the premade style noodle, the wide variety of vegetables and texture of tofu really made this dish shine, I really like the skinny green beans and thai basil.  The springroll was a bit cool and soggy, I think this is what we get for coming a bit late for lunch. The portion size was quite good, making the higher price acceptable.  There are a surprising amount of tables inside this small store front, and they can even accommodate larger groups as the many tables of 2 can be become tables for 2 4 6 8 or any number you can appreciate.  This is one of the few non chain places for lunch in the heart of down town, and its good too, give it a try, it can even work for a business lunch as it was not too loud and decent inside.

Malls do not need a formal food court, they just need a costco with an external food court like this one.  Unlike other costco's that move in to defunked malls and have an external entrance, you must enter the mall to get inside this costco.   This costco is the one that is closest to my office, so I usually visit it when I need some food for a work party, have a flat and need a tire fixed or when I just get the craving for some samples.  This costco has some items that appeal to the local demographics. there is a wide range of Mexican cheeses available. Also the liquor selection is skewed more to the affordable end of the spectrum.  This is a very unique costco in Arizona for the fact it is in a mall but the actual store is less than my favorite.

The only :) you saw here were on the menu to indicate happy hour menu items, and by hour I literally mean hour 5-6 only.  Overall the menu is fairly standard, but the prices are a bit higher than I expected for a neighborhood store front style join.   We started with a small bowl of miso soup $2 and edamame $3.80 however it arrived with the meal and not as an app.  For rolls we went light with a TNT roll $11.50 Inside was cream cheese, yellow tail and asparagus, no rice all tempura battered and fried. Served on a bed of yuzu sauce and siriacha. The yellow tail was a bit well done for a sushi roll nearly all grey, and the flavors just did not pop in my mouth.  The spicy tuna was mediocre ($6.80) but for that price I was expecting something bigger and or better, it was preseasoned with soy for some reason.   Service was decent. but we were the only table at 8:30. None of us got sick either so that is a pro but given the value to portion size flavor and quality I have to say seek other options.

This is just one of six sushi places with in 2 miles of my house. The sushi has to be good (or a great) value for a place to survive in this shark tank.  I was lured in y their "half price happy hr" which happens to last all day M-TH and 5-7 F. What I don't get is why the happy hr menu lists the full price and makes one do the 1/2 off math in their head. Math is hard after sake!  There are the usual rolls and a few specialty ones that were even new to me. I had a Jalapeño Yellowtail and Cream cheese fried roll, it was excellent with a beading that was not tempura, it was more breadcrumb based. ($4.50 happy hr)  Another nice addition is you start out with complementary tofu soup , edamane and salad. Also I enjoyed the on table siriaha sauce and hot spice shaker, it really made my soy dip better.  The staff is friendly and there seem to be a lot of frequent customers who get a very welcoming greeting.  They also have a 19.99 All you can eat deal, but with the good happy hr prices I think for about $20 I get all I should eat.  I will be back, and I should see you there as this place is good and a great value.

Simply irresistible, We will be back.  Sashimi, sushi, tempura, miso, ginger, ngiri, salad, OH YES.  It was a sat night and my Girlfriend made my quite happy by asking if we can go for all you can eat suhsi. I said sure and decided we would try it at Mido. As usualI was expected a limited ACYE menu and mediocre quality. To my surprise neither were true.  The meal started with Miso soup and a salad. The soup was nice but lacked many tofu chunks, The salad was nothing special but I like sesame dressing.  The first BIG surprise was the Sashimi. While it is not ACYE A single pre fix order comes with the 19.99 ACYE deal. On top of the initial shock that we got sashimi was the Toro, white tuna belly, so fresh and soft it did not need chewing, it was simply amazing. The other fish were also great, and the seaweed salad was enjoyable too. No one touched the squid salad.  Nigiri time, Salmon good, ahi nice, toro AMAZING.,  Bring on the rolls. First we went american with a las vegas roll, tempura fired roll with tuna, tuna and salmon it it, summary GREAT.  A vegge tempura maki roll, GREAT.  Spicy Tuna roll Decent,   Jose role a bit odd and the raw Jalapeno was a bit much for some.   Tempura spicy tuna roll, great  A ton more Toro nigri  still amazing  Maybe it was just a on night and cool weather that lead for fresh fish but this would have been great even if it were not ACYE. Mostly due to the toro and salmon, We walked away pleased and amazed that they are still open at 19.99 with sashimi.

This is just for a quick tip as the Sushi is good as ever.  Don't sit at the sushi bar, you may think you get your sushi sooner as your are staring down the cooks, however this is far from the truth. Two times now my bar side service has been much slower than table shushi.    When sushi is this good I rather not wait for it.

A quick update on the saga of my reviews. Last visit was most excellent, good quality, flavor and quality. Just be aware this is your outing for the night, not a quick meal before a show.   The staff is nice and the services is good, but boat loads of sushi don't grow on trees it takes time.

Crunchy balls of fun, greenish, and never enough, I am talking about falafel.  The flafel here is some of the best in town, cooked to order from a mix and fried. Many places simply reheat premade ones. This process results in a crisp outside a moist inside and due ot their recipe tons of flavor with a bit too much salt.  My falafel sandwich ~$6 had 4 falafel balls tahini, cucumbers and not much else all wrapped in toasted a Greek style pita (think non pocket gyro style).   If you like it spicy ask form some scug (pronounced skooog) it is a great blend of peppers and spices for a unique spicy spread.  This is a fast casual style place, you order up front and they bring you your food (no idea on how to tip at thus style). It is nice they use real plates and silverware.

A small local chain with cheesy commercials that makes fairly decent New Mexican style food. You may not know what new Mexican style food is, simply its Mexican food with Green (hatch) chillies on it or in it. If you have never been to NM and just think a green chillies are like any old jalapeno or plabano you are mistaken. They have a delightfully unique pepper taste and at Arriba are quite spicy too.   If you can not tell by now I go for the green chillies. I often order a very simple dish smothered in green chillies, I enjoy their cheese crisp which is just cheese melted on a flat tortilla and covered in hatch chillies. For lunch I sometimes get the fish taco which does not come with green chilies but they can be added to just about anything. I do like the fact that when they say something is spicy, it truly is.   In addition to any meal comes chips, salsa and bean dip. You receive two types of salsa a large cup of standard and a small cup of spicy hatch chili salsa. This small cup of hot salsa is great and be sure to ask for more. The bean dip is also quite good. Often we fill up before our meal comes.   I usually don't drink alcohol with my meals, however the fact they have a in house micro brew some time persuades me. It is ok as beers go. They also have .99 margaritas during happy hour and at that price how could one say no.   One of the great deals during Happy hour is the .99 margrita which was surprisingly good and in funny glass.   Also in late Aug early Sept they have a Hatch chili roast and sell it by the pound. Great stuff.

I hate getting home from a trip, waiting at the baggage return to pick up a suit case full of smelly clothing. For some reason I love the same concept when it involves waiting around a conveyor for a plate of raw fish.  Walk in, and sign up.  This is smart eliminating the need for a hostess that does little.  Get to your seat tell then what you want to drink and start looking at the plates. From what I saw most nigiri is $1 or $1.50 for two pieces. They are a bit smaller that normal ngiri. The Quality was decent Not great or gourmet but not bad or scary like you may think $1 sushi is.   Rolls come in 4's (spicy tuna $1.50) and fancy 4s  (Hawaii roll $2) plates.  I really enjoyed the Hawaii roll which is just a spicy tuna roll plus tuna on top and a siricha and mayo mix.  Part of the fun is watching everything go by and wondering what will be next.  The best spots will be near the cooking area as you get first pick at the plates.  We go here early at 5:15 on a rainy weeknight and it was busy so, worries about general fish freshness can be avoided.  However I do wonder how they keep track of less popular items,  like the squid salad or mackerel. The whole hour we were here I think I saw the same plates make over 10 lonely trips around.  I did learn that you can ask the cooks in the center for special orders too if you don't see what you want, however I did not test this.  They also have non sushi items making their way around, from edamame, cream puffs, cheese cake, Asian drinks, pudding cups and some jalapeno popper concoction.  If you want a fun cheaper sushi meal give this place a try. Its not the best sushi but its fun cheap and unique for Arizona.   3.5 stars if I were allowed FYI  In the end they add up the plates and you pay. hooray, I am not sure how to tip at a place like this.

The name is fresh mint however I did not see many mint items on the menu.  I  was in a hurry and got a to go order off the $8 lunch menu. The menu has many options for traditional veggie favorites to some with fake meat.  I wanted to give a faux cow a try and I went with the Mongolian beef. It took about 6 min and I was given my 3 compartment Styrofoam box.  Inside the main compartment was the Mongolian beef with fancy cut carrots onions and celery. Brown rice on the side (a nice no charge up grade) and a small salad. Not bad for $8.  The Mongolian beef was decent not evident it was faux cow, the veggies were crisp the sauce was a bit bland however. The rice was cooked well and the salad was fresh and crisp. The portion size was a bit smaller than some one of my size would like.   That is the key to "healthily food", less food what a great business model.

Does Trendy = Healthy? Well here it seems to. While this is one of the few trendy Americanaized Indian restaurant in town.  The big star here for me is the menu. Vegiteran dishes and Vegan ones are all marked on the menu.In addition many menu items can have the protein of choice including tofu and or veggies. And a choice of starch, rice, brown rice or egg noodles.   We had two build you own combos, Curry with mixed veggies and tofu over noodles $11.95 +$1 for tofu. The curry was a bit bland and the noodles to me were not the best match, but if it were truly healthy I would be ok with the flavor. The other dish was a spinach dish, with mixed veggies and brown rice. I really enjoyed this dis. $11.95  As with Thai food you get to pick you heat level so anyone can eat here.  For flavors it was 3 stars the veggie options made it 4. However I did miss the Bollywood music I usually hear with my Indian food.

Mama Mia! what are you a doing here?   I was leery to say the least coming to this part of town with my boss for lunch. It is in a small strip mall where the .99 store even found a need for metal bars on the winnow. This is not your typical location for fine dining.   External appearances inside you are met with a small dining room with nice tables and chairs (no table cloths.) Note seating is limited to 4 four person tables and two 2 person tables.   The menu us full of Italian food like pastas, not just pizza.   Due the name of this place I had to try the pizza, I went with a small vegetarian ($10) It had everything on it, including artichoke, eggplant, olives and more.  For a small it is a good size, this with a app or salad would be good for two. Big me only ate half.  Meals include and amazing bruchetta, the flat bread is hot straight from the wood oven, the bruchetta is full of flavor and is fresh.  My bosses spagetti and meatballs (8.95) were artfully presented and, as I could see the kitchen cooked and sauted to order. He enjoyed his meal as well.  If you are looking for some great food in a very unexpected location give this place a try.

It is local so it must be good! Ha! Hippy marketing is so funny.   If something is local, should it not be cheaper? No transport fees, cheap local imported labor, and cheap land in undesirable south Phoenix. However this are anything but cheap.  Mid 70's a slight breeze and clear skies a perfect day for a pick nick. However, I am a bachelor; no way would I prepare my own.  That is why we went here, that and I have not been there to review yet.   We entered to a crowded patio and waited in a long line to order.  The menu was sparse with just some sandwiches and salads, all of them $10 and sides were $2.50.  I went with the seasonal veggie sandwich, the menu said it had cheese, however it did not. In addition there were beets, pepitas, baby spinage and dressing on multi grain bread.  It was a decent sandwich, the bread had a slight stale note to it. Moreover, at $10 it was quite possible one of the worst values ever. That price included no sides, no service, beverage or even condiment station.  My friends tried a salad, which was laughably small for $10. We tried a slice of pecan pie, which was mediocre.  The best part of the trip was walking around and taking photos of everything. As for food next time, I will just bring my own or try the other restaurant here.

The black Forrest mushroom quesadilla was one of the best tasting items I have had in a long time anywhere. As for my other dish it was decent but I am just not the biggest fan of "raw" food.  Despite the name this place is much more of a cafe than a juice bar as they have solid food and not just snacks.   Each dish is $10-13 a bit pricey for what it is but this seems to be the going rate for local veg cuisine.   As for the food I had the "ravioli, which was really beat slices with a creamy vegan sauce and some salad. It was good and a bit rich which is surprising as it was raw, for me the flavors were not varied enough. We also had the aforementioned quesadilla which was amazing large chunks of sauteed mushrooms and a few other items in a green tortilla.   Now if they could just be open for dinner.

Gastronomy, refinement and diversity are the words I would use to describe 9 on 9.  The Dinner menu has 3 sections, Warm, Cold and Entrée`  The warm consists of items that could be appetizers but are a bit large to just be that, they would make a great bar meal mostly ranging from $12-16  The entrée's are a bit higher priced at $25-30 but are well worth it. I had the Barramundi $28 that came on a bed of potato risotto, green beans and was garnished with "basil caviar" which was made using some food science trickery. The fish was seared with a nice curst yet soft and flakey inside, the potatoes were just right, firm and packed with a stubble flavor. The basil caviar was a fun and flavorful garnish. My coworker had the salmon, served with seared bock choy,  green beans and a mushroom corn sauce. The portion looked huge and it was topped with a foam. $26  The ambiance matches the food, dim, modern yet luxurious. Great for a date, celebration meal or just a great meal out.

Bright flavors, expansive menu, generous condiment bar and Styrofoam plates.  This is a great little veg Indian spot, which is an order at the counter, and they bring it to you format.   All of the usual (non meat) options are here plus some other treats like Dosa's and Thali plates. A thali plate is a great option for those who can not decide as it they are like a mini sampler complete with several small cups of food and a few starches to go with it. Top on to that some of the great coconut chuney from the condiment bar and you have yourself a party in on your table.   When looking at the menu realize that this place is authentic and if something is on the spicier end, only order it if you like spice.

I went back here today with the same cowoker as last time.  This time things were a bit more user friendly. We were offered a full print menul to look at by the register, this listed everything and described it.  I went with the flafil, at 2.99 it is a bargain, and a "cheese pie" as the name just spoke to me.  The Flafil was decent, the flat bread is not my favorite but for 2.99 its a good filling meal.    The cheese pie is best described as sauceless pizza, cheesy bread etc. It was good, the cheese was nicely melted and browned and the crust was good and chewy. at 1.99 is a great addition to any meal.  My coworker loves the fries for some reason.   He also tried a mint yogurt drink. It may have been bad (but the date said it was good). Maybe that is just the taste, either way it tasted like bad milk wit a mint after taste.

Tip and tricks, that is the key.  I love pita and hummus, And the do offer this at Al-hana, however do not forget where you are, AT A GROCERY STORE. for .99 you can get a bag (5 or6) fresh still warm large pitas. Then for ~1.50 you can buy a can of hummus.  so for less than $3 you can have a huge amount of this to have with your meal.  As always I opt for the falafel sandwich which at 2.99 is a great deal but a bit small alone.  They do have hot sauce I found, but it is just franks red hot sauce, and it overwhelms the flavors of your food.  Try a Thyme (zatar) pie. for .99 it packs a huge flavor punch.  I recommend brining a bottle of water as there is no fountain for drinks here.

This place is great,  but there a few things that keep it from being 5 stars.  First off, the hours, they close at 3 on some days at at 7 on others, this makes it hard to even get here for me as I do not work near by.  Secondly the prices. $15 for a salad and $18 for a large wrap is pretty steep considering I don't get table cloths.  Those two issues aside I like it, Great smells from the herbs, many healthy items in salad wrap or entree form and a extensive herbal tea selection.  We had a cow girl wrap large ($18) yes it was large, it was a bit burrito like with the beans, spicy mayo and avacado.I t was good, the quinoa salad on the side was nothing too special. You decide if that is a good value or not.  We also had a quinoa salad, topped with many fresh veggies. ($15) this was good too (not great).   Service was sporadic as all of my refills on my iced tea came at the end of the meal  I would go back but not too often as the prices are roughly double what I think they should be.

For just $2 it is not a bad place to check out.  Row after row of glass cases full of amazing minerals, rocks and metals.  There are some other displays where rocks have been laid out to look like food on plates.  There was a special side exhibit that had nothing to do with rocks, it was part of a collection of recent AZ history. It looked more like a gift shop from old town with all of the random south west trinkets.  I really enjoyed the two UV rock cases. It is a bit hidden so make sure you look for it.  Up stairs are diorama of mining towns and how mining operations work. If I wanted to play with the trucks as if I were a child again.  There are even free rocks you can take with you at one section.  The gift shop has a good amount of interesting items too.  Out side is old mining equipment great for photo ops.  Good for about an 1 hour +-

After trying their samples for years at many Yelp event's I finally had a chance to eat here.  Start with a free bred and butter sample, makes sense as this is a bread company.  I had the butternut squash ravioli, I really liked this dish however the filling does cross the line from savory to sweet.  My wife's salad was great too I now have a place where I can eat and she can have a hearty salad at good prices.

Prices as good as you can find online with out the need to ship and the ability to get help.  I made the trek up north to get a new helmet, I know my hat size but that  did little to comfort me for buying helmet.   The in store staff helped me find the right fit which with our their help I would have though was too small as I did not think about break in.  Check their prices online as they may be lower and they will honor them in store.  If they don't have what you need they will order it and have it sent to the store or directly to you for no added cost.  They also stocked other gear for motorcyclists. It was nice to see knowledgeable staff who knew the products vs some minimum wage workers.  Just as a note check the hours as they are not always open.

Great menu, location and ambiance, however the execution was what holds it back.  Chef owned, local feel and a good looking menu everything seem right, however I did skip the key step of checking yelp first.  At a distance the patio looked great and it was the first cool evening of the year, but as we sat there we noticed how the seats really needed cushions and the table was repaired with duct tape.  For dinner we had the risotto of the day which was a artichoke risotto $15 and we also had had a Ahi salad $13. The risotto was just too creamy with pools of cream or butter at the corners of the dish, this went beyond rich to flat out heart attack inducing. The heavy hand was also evident on the salad that was heavily dressed. The tuna was served on it as a single steak, semi rare and only pink on the inside, not the highest quality tuna.   The included bread and butter only came as the meal came out, it was good with a sun dried tomato butter.  Bottom line it might look nice and seem like a great idea but this place is more for the tourist / theater crowd.

Apparently something is healthy if you can put the words "organic," "Wild," or "Natural" in front of each main ingredient.  At least this is what True Food Kitchen would have you believe.  Naturally I went here with a good friend of mine for lunch. We had a short wait to sit on the patio. We started with the hummus appetizer. I was not impressed at all, granted I am a hummus snob (Go Sabra!). The Pita slices could have used a nice grilling, and the veggies were pedestrian.   For my meal I had the Ahi tuna sliders. It came with a sweet potato hash. The sliders were small and the ahi was a bit overdone for my tastes, the wasabi mayo covered the overdone nature of the Ahi. This is where I again question this healthy nature, copious amounts of mayo is not healthy when compared with the option of properly seared ahi. The sweet Potato hash was acceptable. The meal left me hungry however.  The Organic Service was sub par, and the exposed tattoos and odd hair colors of the wait staff seemed unbecoming of a place with prices this high.   Given a choice of Fox restaurant concepts this is not my first.

Everybody loves pizza and it was evident today at this Z pizza, There was a line to order, a line to fill your drink, a line to get a table and a line to pick up your food.  Despite the crowd we were in and out in about 30 min. I opted for the #1 combo, any two slices, a drink all for $6.93 with tax. Not great for 2 slices if you get cheese but a good deal for the gourmet options.  I went with one of the daily slices the "greek" A sauce free pizza topped with feta, red onion and katmala olives. The crust here has a decent crunch too it and the chees was cooked enough. There are also some decent condiments, the standard parmesan and red pepper, granulated garlic and a franks style red hot sauce.  Once our names were called we lucked out and got a window bar style seat.  There is a nice patio which may be some use after October, but for a 110 day in August it is just ornamental.  Decent artisan toped pizzas, ok prices and fast service it is a good lunch option for a smaller group.

Authentic, and fancy is a rare mix.    Often if I want a authentic meal it means finding that hold in the wall spot, conversely if I ant a fine dining experience it means sacrificing some character in my food. Satara is an exception to this  I went in today for a late lunch with some co workers, it was after the rush so there was no wait for a table. Inside you are greeted by a water wall, and a series of private wine lockers for the regulars.  Their lunch menu is quite extensive covering the usual curry and noddle dish plus many Chinese inspired offerings.   I decided to go with the green curry, one of my usual favorites. A nice tough is the option of soft or crispy tofu. As usual I got it Thai Hot.  Not too long after ordering my food arrived, with the curry on one dish, and a dome  of rice on the other. My curry was quite rich using a very fine coconut milk. The green bean were crisp and fresh and the crispy tofu was just that and delicious. I did enjoy the array of vegetables, and the lunch potion was quite large. One thing I did notice was the rice seemed a bit soft and sticky for Thai food, I typically expect a longer grain rice like basmati .   The over all spiciness of the dish was on the lower end of the Thai Hot spectrum, but they will gladly bring out more spice if you desire.  I also enjoyed the cucumber water served in a very unique crescent glass.   If you happen to be in the far NW valley and would like a fine Thai dining experience give this place a try.

Great tools, people and a decent used parts selection and rock bottom prices.  Ever want to work on your bike but lack the tools? Or know how?  That is where this place comes in. They have all of the tools and many friendly people who can show you what to do (they want you to learn). If you need parts they may have it in their inventory of used / donated bike parts.   They are only open 3 days a week so plan accordingly (Sunday afternoons Monday evening and Thurs evening.)  If you have a bike you want to grease up, work on or get working again stop by.  They also have some good prices on nicer things that have been donated like SPD SL road pedals for $20 etc.   Note this is for your around town type bike, if you have a serious mountain bike or road/tri bike this is not for you unless you want to learn how to work on your own bike and help others learn.

I have had better in many ways. But where do I start.  It took about 20 min to get our order. Not exactly a speedy lunch.  My $2 side of jalepno hushpuppies was very small consisting of 5 of them about the size of tatertots.  My whiting sandwich was just once price of fish where breading on t e bottom was soggy and a lackluster bun for $4.  Tartar sauce is rationed in small little cups.  The Ambiance is also lacking in this former quiznos, the floor still sports a Q, most of the burned out light bulbs have yet to be replaced and the Oder of something permeated my clothing.  Slow service, bad prices and medicore food, I just don't get it.

I am just ahh soo impressed with the random little find. $4.99 lunch specials, good portion size, no charge extras and the most durable to go containers I have ever seen.  It was a hot day of moving rock and laying pavers at my friends house when the question for lunch came up. Some how Chinese became the idea on the table. After a quick search on yelp we found a place but a mile away from where we were toiling.  Their website featured their full menu which is allays nice. I ordered the lunch special home style tofu with brown rice. It was a great mix of rim well textured tofu, crisp vegetables a light brown sauce and a few red chillies. It could have been spicier but not bad. You get a choice of a side, egg roll, or one of many soups, (I don't think any of the options are meat free however,) or a drink.  It was great to see that brown and fried rice were the same price as the white.   Note there are a few meat free dishes on the lunch special menu, a real plus.  If you work in this area or are looking for a cheap good dinner, give the place a try, I sure which I had one of these near my office

I was initially excited at the idea of fast indian food. The ordering eperance at the kiosk is novel. On my first and only trip to Hurry 4 Curry I was a bit disappointed. The menu lacked the number of options one would see at other Indian reatraunts.   I ordered a dish that equated to a black stew of lentils and spices with naan. Despite the limited menu and ordering format it too the food several minutes to be ready. For the price ($7 no drink) the portion was very small as was the piece on Naan. The flavors were quite muted when compared to some Indian places, and this also disappointed me as I like bold and spicy indian foods. I gave their condiment a try, it looked like onions and peppers in a sauce, however it was just very very salty and lack any other flavor.  I then went to get my parking validated. I then found out when leaving the garage that the validation that this place offered was virtually useless. This ended up adding another $5 to a quick and small Indian lunch.

Now I know why Emo guys can fit into jeans made for tween girls, they eat at places like this. It would make sense; this must be the target audience with this location.  I arrived just past noon with a co worker, luckily there was a police car parked nearby so I was not afraid to leave my car in this less than ideal neighborhood.   From the outside it looks modern, trendy and bright.   Inside are white tables and chairs, seating is limited but their business also seemed to be a bit limited. After hearing about the specials and looking over the menu I chose the Blue Cheese Quesadilla with tomato Marmalade as I do love blue cheese.   When my meal arrived I was shocked how small, pale and pedestrian it looked. Unlike the photo provided my quesadilla was much smaller made with an out of a package soft taco sized tortilla. Accompanying it was a small almost garnish sized dollop of rice salad on top of some baby spinach greens. The rice salad was cold, and flavorless, cold rice is rarely a good culinary choice.   My quesadilla was under done and unevenly browned, there was plenty of marmalade but not too much cheese. The flavors just did not work for me even when I tried to pair it with the apple garnish.   My coworker ordered the lentil soup special of the day. It came in a small cup with a challa spinach and cheese Panini on the side. When a ~100lb female says hr portion was small you know it must be small. She enjoyed the soup, and felt the Panini was just mediocre filler.   My second drink refill, when it finally came was warm as they had no ice in the pitcher.  I see no reason for me to try another meal here.

Postinos a spot for high rollin' winos.   You woke up at noon and had breakfast during lunchtime, so the next logical step is to have lunch food during dinner time, with some wine. This is where postino's comes in.   The menu is full of salads, Paninis, bruschetta and a few apps. There is a large by the glass wine menu ($8-$14) and hipster cool ambiance.   Service here is great, the patio is quite nice with heaters, a fire place and even a few patio furniture loungers.  Great for a date, hanging with friends and conversation.  We started with the Bella Postino $9 Crustini with a artichoke dip and a hummus. The artichoke dip was great as any fat laden dip would be. The humus was ok but I am a hummus  snob.  For our main we had the Vegetarian Panini ($9.75) It was good and moist with hummus roasted tomatoes olives and an artichoke spread, the focaccia bread was well toasted from the Panini press.  We also had the mediterranean  salad 8.75 which is a romaine salad with copious amounts of feta. Pretty good as I do like cheese but maybe not as healthy as one would want from a salad.  For desert we had a crem burle, simple not to sweet and well executed a classic.

Gourmet pickles and breakfast. Two tings I don't have rarely but I found both here.  I had a basic veggie omelet with potatoes and some fruit. Even as a split plate is was a good size and made for an affordable $4.50 each ($9ish total)  The eggs were as expected, I was surprised by the meddely of potatoes including purple ones, it was good and unusual. The fruit was nothing too special. What made the meal great was a decent selection of small label hot sauces.  In the market they had some nice gourmet pickles, something I had been looking for some time.   My one complaint is that the meals and other things seem to be about 20% higher priced then I would like to see.

Attention vegans, you can eat it all. Everything on the menu. No meat, eggs, or dairy, however I bet cows did help make the fertilizer that was used to grow everything.  The hardest part is deciding what to order. Usually a menu has one two veggie options not 20+.  The menu has a few different areas, one has dinner food, like chili dogs and burgers. The other has Asian food and a touch of Indian. There are also appetizers that also seem skewed Asian and there are soups.   The ambiance is a bit lacking, bright and very white bland would be the best way to inside, you order at a counter and they will bring you your food.  We started with a mock fried shrimp with peppers (cha cha) its a was great however it was hard to get the two items in to your mouth at the same time. The spring rolls were nothing special. The veggie pho` was decent.

Sorry bro' this place was just not that great, at least not when I was sober.   I had the falafel pita and my friend had a gyro, My falafel was dry, and lacked the great crunch and flavor I have had else where, there as hardly any tahini in the pita (which really was peta) and it could have used a few more options to dress it up. The only condiment they have is a franks red hot style vinegary hot sauce that does not match the food.   My friends was just "eh" according to him, His meal came with a side of hummus which I did try. The humus was not the smoothest or the most flavourful it was also "eh I have had better" much better actually.  The wall is covered in dollar bills with slogans from the fraternities on near by new row, and that is who I think this place appeals to at 1am after copious amounts of drinking.

Ride on in for the best deal on a tune up in town.   Call after call I reach out to most of the bike shops in town, tuneups were 50 to 100% more expensive and their hours made it hard to drop off and pick up in the same week.   The store it self is a bit over crowded due to a lack of focus, they have mountain, road and cruiser bikes. Most of the gear here seems focused on the lower end market of the adjacent college.  I dropped my bike off on a Sunday and by Monday evening it was ready to go and for $35 which was a great deal. The tune up seemed decent too.

It is brave to make yet another Mexican restaurant in an area flooded with them. The key here is uniqueness.  At first I was a bit reluctant as restaurants in hotels don't tent to be that great.  On the outside there is a bright orange eatery inside a repainted old hotel. The entrance is also the hotel lobby entrance, and the hostess stand is located awkwardly in the middle of the dinning room.  For lunch it was quiet busy with with many parties of 2 filling up the 4 tops and a sole person holding down a table of 8, so we sat at the dark bar.  A quick glance at the menu found a few veggie options like veggie tacos and fish tacos. I went with 2 veggie one fish and we split a guacamole.  The guacamole was good, rough mashed avocado with cojeta cheese on top. The real star was the red hot sauce, it was thick like a paste, and had a really deep flavor beyond that of just spicy. The chips were nothing special.  Our tacos arrive in a neat meal \/\/\/ . With one lime per 3 tacos.  The veggies were good nicely roasted with a nice texture and savory rich flavor. The tortilla was a crude hand made tortilla that had a moist thickness to it that I liked.  The fish in the fish taco had a great flavor sear to it.  I saw on the board a 2 for 1 taco Tuesday that would be a great deal. Either way I just want more of that hot sauce.

The Ahi Tuna Torta changed my life. Over 24 hours later and I still lust over every detail of it.   From the star of the well spiced and seared ahi that was plentiful, the in house soft toasted white roll, spiced mayo and cabbage it was a divine mix of flavors and texture. All for less than $12.   Enhancing this were two "salsas"  One was a thick roasted pepper red salsa, it has a good spice note and viscous texture that did not run off of chips. I could drink this. There was a green cilantro tomatillo one that was good but I am not a tomatillo fan.

Between bread or on top of lettuce, is the main choice you will make here as the vast majority of the foods are either salads, sandwiches or a few pasta options.  I suggested we visit this hidden place for a team lunch one Friday. The weather was perfect for a location with a large patio like this.   Our party of five was quickly seated at a round table that fit us perfectly. The tables to did wobble a bit but the chairs were comfortable and we were in the shade. It took some time for us to all decide on our meals, and drinks were brought while we read. My coworkers who ordered coke surprisingly received tall bottles of coke made with cane sugar.   We then placed our orders and I opted for the seared Ahi Tuna on a "giant" English muffin, I was healthy and selected the salad as my side. The dressing options were unique, including at sweet champagne dressing, and a lime one that I selected.   Our meals arrived in an acceptable time, My Ahi was rare just as I had ordered, and it was topped with a bit of sauce possibly a garlic herb mayo based sauce. The English muffin was decent but would have benefitted from some time over a grill. The Ahi itself was decent quality and the flavor was clean.   My accompanying salad consisted of tender baby greens and a light neon colored lime dressing and a few diced tomatoes. I asked for a side of their "Atomic" horse radish, it arrived quickly and was quite pungent.  My co worker who ordered a turkey club noted the high quality of the bacon on his sandwich; another co worker was pleased with their portion size. It was said that the French fries option while looking natural and rustic and well seasoned lacked some of the crispness that is found in an ideal French fry.  The meal ended with a complimentary mini double chocolate cookie that was soft and just exquisite.   Overall I was pleased with the quality and quantity of my food, the service was decent and on a nice spring day the location is hard to beat. Parking is only available on the street so be prepared to do a bit of hunting

They really focous on the grill part. The meul is full of griled chicken, meat and a fish item. There also are pizzas and pastas.  My main grip with this place i having highly adulterated dishes, go to italy and fettuccine Alfredo means, noodles and sauce, no chicken. The theme is carries out thought the menu, in a poor attempt to seem original lobster, sausage or chicken is added to most traditional dishes.  This left me a vegetarian with only a few choices, I went with the Grilled salmon (no sauce) with the garlic mashed potato. The salmon was a  standard farm raised variety and typically over cooked for my tastes. The potatoes were decent as enough garlic and butter can make anything good. ($17)  I did like the bread here but that is not enough of a reason to get me back. A long wait for mediocre Salmon at a less than stellar price.

I can hardly tell my paneer's from my Gobi's but I can tell you that I like this place.  Walk in and you will find a modern contempray dinning room with granite top tables, booths and tables. In back is the buffet setup.  We were in for lunch at 12:30 on a Saturday and the buffet was the only option, and what a good option it was. So many flavorful dishes and All VEG!  I tried them all then tried many a second and third time.  We were offered dosas, a Indian crepe like item. I don't know if this cost us extra but it was good and with dosa's the buffet was $12.  The dishes had pretty good flavor, some flavors did not pop as much as I would have liked but overall the selection and quality won me over. The buffet is nice as I am still mostly lost on what to order when looking at an Indian food menu.   We had water with our meal, they give you glasses and a carafe of water but oddly no ice.  If you are veg go here and just keep eating, if you are not, you may not even notice that the place is meat free.

We were hungry and sporting a hangover so pizza seemed like a good idea.  This place has one thing going for it, it was there, and where we were.  A long slow line to order pizza was unnecessary, despite a vast menu they did not have much available. and the prices 5.25-$6 for a 1/4 of a pie slice is no deal.  The pizza is self tastes like poor quality bread with some cheese, no flavor no character to the crust nothing.   There is a small adjacent dining area that has pepper and Parmesan cheese tables.  i really doubt any one plans to eat here, so this will not be read, but in case you are planing to eat here, steer away.

Hiding inside of a strip mall is a Indian grocery hiding inside of that is the Chaat Cafe.  I have to admit, I did not know what to expect going in as there were only 2 little reviews on here.  You walk in and the "cafe" is to the right 5 or 6 tables, a counter to order at and a cooler case full of deserts. The menu is straight forward and nicely divided into "vegetable dishes" and "non-vegetable" dishes.  As usual I had no idea what to order, so I went with the Vegetable combo for 6.99 that included 2 curries of they day, rice, naand, salad, mystery white stuff and desert.  I didn't know what to expect.    I was surprised and over joyed when a LARGE sectioned metal tray came out with my food after a bit of a wait.  The food was great, fresh, full of flavor and so far no ill affects on the digestive tract. My co worker also liked his meat dish.  There is the stereotypical TV with VCR for Bollywood movies but it looks like it was for sale. We were treated to some interesting Hindi music and or talk radio.  They take cash and credit, I am still unsure if a tip is expected.  I will be back, and I will be trying many more things here.

This is the reason you  don't see many review from me. I am always going back to this place.  The locals are now used to us and we have figured out what some of the menu items are.   When you walk in don't be discouraged that it may be empty or there is no one maning the counter, both customers and service come in spurts.   Take a look at the menu and order the combo. Non-veggie for the meat lovers, and Veggie for us non meat eaters. ($6.99 and $7.99 respectively)  While you wait browse the aisles of the groceries store and marvel at all the the food items you have no clue what they or how to prepare them. Discover the heat and eat Indian food that makes a great quick luck, just be sure to check the expiration date ($1.50-2.00) each.  Sit down, grab a cup of water from the orange cooler and you food will arrive on a large metal tray just like the ones they use at the food bank.  Smell the vibrant aromas emanating from the tray of mostly alien delights. Start with the salad as it will warm you up. Then dig in, mix the rice with the specials of the day and enjoy. This is one meal your tongue will really love.  But wait you are not done, next comes the surprise desert! What will it be? I am eating it and still do not know, but it is good!  You may not fit in here, it may not be fancy. But it is quite good and it is your only Indian option in the down town area.

I have a new love, and it's name is channa bahtura.  After many visits to this place I decided to try something other than the famous combo plate. I went with the channa bahtura $5.99 .  At 5.99 this dish is a steal. It includes two large channa fry breads. Which are ironically allot like the other Indian fry bread, and a generous portion of bahtura which is a garbanzo bean based dish in a flavorful sauce topped with some diced red onion. The channa is golden, puffy crsp and extremely hot when it arrives. The flavor of it is wonder as with anything fried. The bahtura is also quite good with its bright flavors and the texture variation from the garbanzo beans. I am still not completely sure on how one eats this but I go with some dipping pinch and even eating separately.  There is a new expanded menu to check out too, it even has Indian pizzas , wraps and more.   They are closed Monday's and if you tab is under $10 it will cost you .60 extra to use a credit card.

Another day another dish or two to try. Today I went with Indian Pizza and a small order of Aloo Tika chaat.   As usual I had no idea what to expect when we placed the order.   The Aloo Tika Chaat 2.99 arrived first. I was instantly the star of the table, this cardboard boat contained an immense flavor punch and some great textures. There were garbanzo beans, two large potato like dumplings and a great curry sauce. If you want flavor this is the dish for you and at 2.99 how can you go wrong?   A coworker and I split a large paneer pizza $8.99. This was basically a veggie pizza with some seasoned paneer topping and a good spice note from the tomato sauce. The crust is thick and crunchy. As a pizza it was decent, however I was expected it to be a bit more exotic.  Stay turned for my next random items on the menu adventure at New India bazaar where every meal is a new adventure.

In some ways it is all different but in some ways it is the same.  The new full cafe' is open, it is in back you can enter from the grocery store or the back door.   There is plenty of seating in large comfortable chairs. Flat screens on the wall playing Bollywood and of course the obligatory lunch buffet. $7.99  Let me be clear the food on the buffet is just as good as what one could order. The Saag today was still packed with flavor, the pakora had a nice crunch, good pickled mangoes and jasmine rice. and at just $8 it is on the value end of lunch buffets. But I do miss the fun of the combo tray.  Some things you will find on the buffet here that you may not else where inclue, chow mein noodles. Saag, fresh slices of jalapeno, super strong pickled mangoes and at times even (Indian) pizza.   I am still a huge fan and will be back many times. Go in now its a buffet in a real cafe you have no excuse.

Part of the fun is exploring. Sure I love the paneer, masala,  saag, rice, naan, pakora etc  but some times something new to me blows me away.  This is what Chili Gobi did. Coli flour in a light egg batter stir fried with pepper onions and spice. It is India meets china and its great. I would never have thought to order this but the commitment free nature of the buffet made it possible.  The puri rice was great as were all the other items. The naan has gotten better and the service is still spoty, but luckily its a buffet.  bottom line the food is great and at 7.99 its affordable.

Chatt, Tea and Pizza three of the surprised I found on my last trip.   Most buffets have the usual suspects garnished with rice naan and some condiments. But to have a Chatt available?  Chai Tea (included) and even pizza (yes Indian style veggie pizza and its good)  This is why I am so in love with this place, 1 Great Flavor, you can beat the unmuted flavors that sing in your mouth. 2. variety, there is more to Indian the palak paneer and tandori chicken and pakora. 3. Value great price for a wide range of options.   Next time you are in take a look at the left end of the buffet first and see if you can find a Chaat.

Clean and commercialized is how I would describe this place. IT lacks the authentic feel and ambiance I would expect.  But this is not why the score it low, it was the flavor to value ratio.  My avocado tomato and mayo torta was $5 and it was slightly larger than a .99 hamburger. It had a very creamy flavor from the avocado and tomato on the soft bun. Add to that some 1.99 french fries and I had a unfilling meal.  The one highlight of this place is the condiment station, with a great creamy and hot red salsa, avocado dip and fried peppers.   If you rarely stay away from the big chains and want a torta this is for you, if you like the flavors and fell of local dining look on.

More than just Pho`  You sit at long almost communal tables with just a small gap separating you from your neighbor.  Prices are low but the portion sizes match that so order a few things.  There is a great Veggie selection, spring rolls noodle dishes even a pho like soup.  The service is fast.  The food it self is quite good, both the noodle dish and the veggie pho I had were great was was the veggie spring roll.  Parking is tight up front but there are more spots in back.

I am a pretty pleased pizza snob. The taste of the pizza is passable which is rare for AZ. The service is fast even when ordering a large pie, selection is wide and the prices are very reasonable.   The location is a pro and a con. It is next to a movie theater. This means it makes a great meal before or snack after a evening flick. The downside is you are most likely going to walk a bit from your parking spot.   The format is self serve. You order at the counter and they bring you your order, drinks spices etc the rest if up to you, so no need to worry about a big tip.  Is also is nice to see powdered garlic on the tables, this is a must that my NY pizza soul and it is great that I don't need to smuggle in my own garlic like I do at many other places.   To date I have tried the plain cheese thin crust several times and I always enjoyed it. I also tried the Sicilian style (square) pizza. The Sicilian was good but not quite up to true NY standards.   For a quick slice or cheap quality pie give it a try, why would I lie, will this rhyme ever die?

I thought the food was coming directly from Thailand, because of how long it took to get it.  From the moment we entered things seemed a bit off. We were not welcomed, and after a awkward two minutes up front the hostess walked to the tables with some menus and we assumed to follow her.  We got to our table and review the lunch menu, pretty much standard items. We waited some time before we put in our orders, we also hand to remind the waitress that we needed to order drinks.  After a decent wait our soup came,   and then our waters.  The soup was decent and it was fun to spicy with the condiment tray on the table.  We then waited, waited and waited,  47 minutes after we entered our food arrived, this does not work well for a lunch.  My Druken Noodles were mushy and soft. (6.95 combo)  The Won-ton chips were quite stale and my meal did not even come with the egg roll that the menu indicated was included.  Just a note if you decide to come here for some reason their spice scale is the same 1-5 but 3 is hotter than you usual 3.  We then played the waiting game again to get some dogie bags and our bill which we just paid upfront.  There are faster, and better options around that are worth the extra $1.

Standing in the suicide lane I contemplated if it was worth risking my life to walk to this place for lunch.  The menu here is a bit more eclectic than the average betero's. It has burgers, fish n' chips and even hot dogs on the menu.  I went with a more original item, a cactus burrito. the staff was nice enough to let me know that the usual red sauce had meat init and they left that out. I ordered some chips with my meal too.  It was the best cactus burrito I ever had, and the only, it is supposedly healthy and not too bad. (4.25) The chips were wonderful  but a bit pricey at $1.25.  Drinks are limited to cans and bottles so getting you food to go and getting a drink at the adjacent circle K is recommended.  There were a few homeless people enjoying a High gravity malt liquor' out on the patio, but that just comes with the territory don't let that scare you away.

In short a casual bar and grill with a beach theme and enough TV's to entertain people during sporting events.   The food on the menu is standard middle class Mexican food, from fish tacos to civiches. Most come here for the drinks and order once they are hungry. There is a $5 never ending bucket of chips and salsa.  The outdoor bar is sounded by sand covered floor so don't wear your nice shoes. There a cabanas for the VIP's and a indoors in case the weather turns sour.    If you are looking for the place to be bar (2010) in the West chandler / Tempe / awatukee area this may be it for you as long as you like laid back non pretentious atmospheres.

This is one of the best costco's in town.   they have all of the usual favorites plus some special items.  High end liqor and wine, some $500+ bottles  Thirsty?  Kosher section with cheese, deli meat and some heat and eat items.  Larger Gift card section.  And some times a hidden gem in the tool aisle  My one gripe about this location is the food court, they opted to use Kirkland hot dogs over Hebrew national.  This costco is part of the PV mall but you can not enter from inside the mall.

Wow, I went in wanting to not like this place and I REALLY liked it.  Unique drinks including a pineapple wine. Which has a pineapple nose and a pino gris finish. A few veggie options and the BEST edamame in town!  The edamame are not usual the are tossed with a chili and green onion spicy glaze that I loved!   The paio is great too large open and not too loud.  The tofu rice bowl at $11 was good too with a nut curry sauce veggies and long strips of tofu.  I saw a Punch bowl with fire on another table, so I assure you I will be back to try this.

Free liquor is illegal but a $.01 tasting is just fine and dandy.  Stop on in and see just about every beer wine and spirit you can want at a decent price.   If you are lucky it will be the tasting hours, and for any amount of $ you can try a few wines and maybe more.  Knowledgeable and helpful staff are here to.

I like carmized food, my wife calls it "burnt" but there is a difference. The stone pot BiBimBap here has nicly carmized rice at the bottom and they are more than willing to replace the meat with tofu here.   The Kimchi and other sides were delectable  Their soft tofu soup was full of flavor  Overall a decent korean otpion, just don't execpt to be stuffed by ordering just one dish.

Build your own beer flight? Yes I think I will.  for $8 you can get four 4oz tasters of any beer's on tap of the 24 they have on tap. Granted unless you get all $8 a pint beers you are not getting the full value but you do get to sample many good micro and craft brews.  Inside the door is a high top table, tow couches a small bar that can seat about 12 ans several booth chair table combos. It is a small narrow place, cozy if you will. Wood paneled walls add a touch of class.  There are a few fridges too for bottles of other exotic beers.  From what we saw it is order at the bar style service, so some one will need to watch your seat. It is also BYO food from the Thai or pizza places next door.   I enjoyed the fact the music was not too loud and the lights were no too low. It is a coffee shop of beer (and wine) I liked the style.

Yelp helped me find this amazing place tonight. I just got home and really enjoyed their beers so it may not be my most coherent review.  This is a true brewery whose main focus is quality beer and a really great atmosphere.  My friend got the sampler ( a great value at $5)  and I started off the the pumpkin hefe that was on special.  We were both quite impressed with the flavors and quality of the beer.   I was very happy to find a place that had music at a level that allowed me to converse with my friends. There was a great movie playing on the many quality LCD TVs with sub titles on. There are tables and couches, There is a popcorn machine with free popcorn and great seasoning. I really love popcorn and this was a real plus.   The interior has has a great decor with many metallic surfaces with one of the coolest looking bathrooms I have seen in some time.   Another neat note about this place is that they are BYOF, Bring your own food. The table next to us had a PIZZA DELIVERED to their table from a local pizzeria.  They have a very limited menu (hot dog with a topping or nachos)  And there is some free UTZ pub mix. Come here for the beer and the surroundings not for the food.   I also tried their Milk stout (named for the lactose added for the yeast to eat) and a standard pale ale. Each beer was great, the pale ale was just right and not too hoppy like most pale ales that try to be IPAs.  There are even board games for those who wish to challenge their friend over their beer.  The only cons about this place is, it closes at 10 (I never wanted to leave) and I wish it was closer to my house.   I will be going back soon, and I recommend you go there right now assuming its between 11am and 10pm

I came prepared this time, I brought my Cornish pastys, connect four and my Breathalyzer.   Just like last time the services was great and the beer was AMAZING. My friends and I did our best to help finish off their pumpkin hefewisen. The spice note on this pumpkin is just right; it is there for the sip with no strong clove bite aftertaste like the one one would except with the hefewisen. We liked it so much we even took a 4-pack home.  I also tried the milk stout, the milk referrers to the lactose sugar that the yeast eats. It had a nice flavor note without being too sharp as some stouts can be.  As usual, the free popcorn was great as was the ambiance.  I will be back this Tuesday.

So the pumpkin hefe is gone,  but the Scottie did go well with the Haji baba falafel i brought.    The popcorn is still great, but the ranch seasoning is gone.  The place is open later (12pm on fri  and sat), but it is becoming more popular so I did not get "my table."  I would like to see some specials or a happy hr to get the 5 stars back from me.    Also the barely wine could have been better / stronger for the  price.  Overall still a awesome, chill, unique place where you can eat what you want to bring, chat with friends with out loud music, and have enough light to play board games if you desire.

Tony and Advantage are exactly what we wish all businesses were:  High Quality, Reasonably Priced On Time.  I had a dent in the fender of my fun car, when I got the dent I was distraught, upset and general grumpy. After searching for a PDR vendor I found Advantage with good reviews, and they were right.  First off he is quite responsive to emails, calls.  He came right on time, no waiting.  He did GREAT work, the den't is truly gone more so than I thought possible. He did not just push the penny sized dent back out. He worked it out back and fourth for over 40 min, using a bright LED light that showed any flaws.  The Price was fair and exactly what I was quoted via email.   If you need painless dent repair, use Tony / Adavantage.

A bowl of rice and a very nice price and and alot of spice is what makes me come here.  I can get a Salmon bowl with brown rice and and a ton of hot spice for less than $7.   Walk in there is a line leading up to the some registers and meny board on the wall, the usual Jap fair chiken teriaki bowls etc, options for all while meat and the like.  I got for the salmon bowl $5.99, a great way to have fish that is not fried at a decent lunch price. I find the teriaki sauce a bit much so I order light on the sauce. for $.25 more you can upgrade to the health factor of brown rice.  Get your bowl and head to the condiment area, there is hot chilli powder, sauce and sliced green onion. I really appreciate the onions.  I think some of the low scores come from the fact japanese food just does not have the flavor punch that Chinese and Thai do.

Thai, Vietnamese a nice patio, good happy hour and a swanky inside they have it all.  Despite being a nicer place as Asian food goes the prices are quite reasonable and it is really a great value.   The happy hour menu has Asian tappas (apps) for $5 and many $5 cocktails and glasses of wine. WE had the salmon satay which was just grilled cubes of salmon on a stick with sauce and some salad, good but nothing special. The veggie wontons were great in a brown sauce and filled with veggies and again a small salad garnish.  My cocktail was great but it was a bit strong.  For our mains we had the Salmon with green curry, It came in a HUGE Bowl it was rich and full of great veggies and fresh not overcooked fish. $12.95  We also had the dragon noodles, which was veggies tofu and glass noodles. It was light and fresh. ~10  Over all great quality value and patio I will be back.

Some times the little things make the biggest differences. In this case it was the Agave nectar.  I am not a huge coffee person due to my aversion to caffeine but I was thirsty and was just next door for lunch. I was happy to hear they can decaf just about any drink.  I went with a basic iced decaf american 16 oz for $2.50 seemed like a decent deal.   With the agave nectar and creamer at the dressings station it was quite good.  The place has a real down town hipster feel with a retro sound system and tables that match the macs that people are using.

Decent crust, unique toppings and fun sides made this a decent choice.  I was at a house party with friends and we oped to get some pizza to go. We got there a bit early and the manager Blake was nice enough to give us a cookie to enjoy while we waited.  We had a white pizza, which was great, but a bit greasy. The crust looks to be partially whole wheat is and very dough like, there was copious amounts of mozzarella  and goat cheese as well as hits of other cheeses.   The super veggie pizza on paper sounded wacky with Tofu on it but in reality it was just a veggie pizza.  If you happen to be up in this end of the world and want some gourmet chain pizza this might be a match for you.

This venue looks like it woul be a great spot for a casul event during the fall winter or spring in AZ and it is all loutdoors or covered patio.   Firepits, stages, saloons and activties are pepperd around this location. It is a bit far from the city, but this will give you a chace to have a drink and look at some stars.

I think they forgot the main ingredient as there as not much ale on the menu. However there was a nice but bit too loud atmosphere good food and low prices.  We went in around 7 on a Monday night. To my surprise the lot was full as was most of the adjoining street.   There were a few people smoking on the patio even though I believe it is forbidden.   Inside is a old hose turned in to modem bistro high top tables, dark walls a bar and loud pounding music. Every table had a nice romantic candle.  The menu mostly consists of salads and sandwiches. We started with the olives appetizer, just a mixed bowl of green and katamala olives $3, I love olives so it would be hard to screw up. For our mains we had a veggie sandwich $8 It was nice on well toasted bread grilled veggies and a great sauce, however the kettle chips were not that great and from a bag. The salad we had $8 was great and fresh with field greens, local tomatoes, artichoke hearts, fresh mozzarella, red onion,  pine nuts & fresh basil tossed in balsamic vinaigrette however the cheese was a bit skimpy.   Over all this may make a great date place on the patio, inside the noise level was a bit much but the food is good and the prices are right.

This is one of the newest Costcos in Arizona. Well new location, it was a mile down the road before in a smaller PriceClub days building by the mall.  This new location is great, it is a left side entrance setup with a standard floor plan.   The item selection was pretty standard with nothing too extravagant or skewed to many demographic.   The gas station is nice and far from the warehouse main entry and exit quite easy with out having to deal with pedestrians from the warehouse  traffic.   The sample selection on a Sunday seemed light compared to others I had visited that day, maybe it is harder to get staff to work the sample stations this far out.   The food court here still offers the superior Hebrew National Hot dogs.

I am wrestling with what to say. The large selection of salsa maybe masked the flavors of my burrito, it's hard to say.   Luchador jokes aside there were many things about my experience here that I liked. From when I entered via a large wooden door, the clean inside decorated with interesting Mexican art, padded chairs and of course the salsa bar. There is a menu on the wall; however it is hard to read. Luckily they have printed ones to order from.   Despite the taco centric name I went with a Mahi burrito sans bacon, filled with grilled mahi, mushrooms, pablano pepper and more. The fish was nicely grilled and tender, the texture of the mushrooms really added to the dish. It was wrapped in a soft tortilla was quite good. Every bite I had was accompanied by one of their many salsas.   The salsa bar was one of the first things I noticed walking in. There were eight options. Mild to spicy, Mellon to smoky they have it as an option. One of the more unique salsas is made from watermelon; it is refreshingly spicy and sweet.   A complimentary basket of chips was delivered to our table, some of the chips were good, and however others were undercooked or stale.   The location was a bit hard to find as its part of a small strip of stores and we parked out front which made for a scary exit backing on to a main road. For lunch today it was a bit odd, we walked in around 11:45 and we seemed to be the second customer of the day, with the first waiting for a to go order. The salsas were just being put out. The entire time there no one else walked in.  From the looks of the massive sign on the door their liquor licence is still pending.

More Salsa, MORE! Is what I wanted, and this is why I brought 2 more coworkers here today for lunch.  This time I was smart and park on the side of the building making it much easier to get in and out.  We arrived just in time a line quickly formed behind us.  Ordering took some time as there was someone who was new and quite flustered at the whole process.  Today I tried the veggie tacos. As with all of their tacos they came as two corn tortillas. Inside was a small amount of grilled vegetables including mushrooms peppers. The items were very well grilled which I liked but it may be a bit too much for most. The Tacos were quite small but to enlarge my meal I only ate the inside tortilla, and then made a salsa, Jamaica, bean and rice burrito with my outer tortilla.   The chips today were much much better; however they were a bit salty.  Today there were a few new salsa items, including a sautéed onions and pepper chutney that was great.   The salsa bar itself seemed to be a bit neglected in the lunch rush with many of the trays sitting empty and many of the little signs missing the salsa that should have been under it.  It was nice to have the fresh crunch of the Jamaica at the salsa bar.  One of my co workers loved his Mayan tacos, and had a lot of fun with the salsa selection. Another coworkers mole` tacos were not her favorite, considering she is from Mexico I will take her word for it.    The storefront became notably small as the tables were  filled and we all kept bumping into one another's chairs.  Will I be back?  Yes.  Am I in a rush to go back? Not really the salsa bar gets it the stars as the price is a bit steep.

Things Evolve over time, so has La Condesa, There now is a big fancy bar and a somewhat different menu.  What really matters is that the flavor, ans salsas are still here.  I had a burrito with Mahi Mahi in it, it came loaded with spinach, mushrooms, cheese and rice. The cheese was a bit much but was still great at 10.59 with tax it should be.  What really mad it great was the salsas. Everything from a peanut salsa, to a strawberry to many of the classic favorites. I really enjoyed the roasted peepers and onions salsa.  Yes the inside is small and the parking is suicidal when you leave, but if you need a flavor shot give this place a try.

High end watches with out the pushy sales staff or snobbery, it's about time!  I enjoy horology and interesting time pieces and this store is full from them. They are a authorized dealer for many high end watch brands like Jacob and Co, Zenith, Bell and Ross and many more. They also have a great selection of used watches at good prices.  What really sets this store apart is the fact that they will politely help you regardless of what you are wearing. Granted when I had on my good replica of a $32,000 watch, the service was very attentive.   This is a true watch store with a great selection and they do know their stuff.  This is in the Scottsdale Fashion mall on the 3rd floor nearish the food court.

I fail to see a reason for this store to even exist.  Item selection in this store is sporadic, poor, the quality can not be attested to and the prices are completely arbitrary.  The store it self has a dirty and temporary feel to it. The crowd that this store attacks is also less than savory.  The store seems out of place in this neighborhood and has little use to me. Other than looking for Halloween costume crap I would not recommend stopping in here.

GOALLLLL My co worker and I lucked out, showing up right as mexico vs France world cup game started.  I was excited a good looking menu, many energized fans, large screen TVs and a large salsa bar.  The menu is in Spanish and the items are much more eclectic than your usual beef burritos and tacos. Out of my weak spanish skills I orderd the chillie rellno plate. $5.65 and a plate of chips.  The red salsa was great spicy and a hit of smokiness, the green avocado source was great too, and the chips were quite unique.  My chillies rellno while spicy, was a bit under cooked, and also seemed a bit grainy and unpleasant esp toward the top. This is why i a gave the 2 star rating.  I also saw some great fun being had by the soccer fans, I am not sure if this is a BYOB place but some one showed up with a 30 pack, hey its 11am and it's the world cup!  My coworker enjoyed his tacos however they were small and a bit pricey considering where we were.

What is this  is what I should ask. The menu is full of nouns that are new to me.  I was not to hungry so I went with a puro queso quesadilla. it was good came beans and a few chips and even a nice garnish.   My co worker loved his carne asada burrito. And we both love the chips hot sauce and guac sauce here.

Hallelujah the sauce is not sweet and the crust is not soft and soggy.  It should not be this hard to finally find the right coronation.  The inside is nothing special, a few tired old arcade games a standard tables and paper towel dispensers on the tables.  The real star here is the pizza. The sauce is good maybe a bit too salty, but nice tang and not sweet, the way it should be. The cheese is generous and and has a good pull to it. the crust is the great foundation that it is all built on, the dough was needed enough to make the glutens nice and chewy, and the over is hot enough to make a crunch to the crust in a reasonable amount of cooking time.  There are the usual condiments at a condiment bar, I would like it if every table had it. And the 18inch cheese pie was not cheap at ~16.  This is a order at the front self serve style place.

The good just keeps getting better.  I went back with my family for more pizza, which in it self is a huge compliment.  The pizza again was cooked fast yet it was crisp on the outside and airy on the inside. The cheese bubbling, the marvels of a HOT OVEN to bad others wont follow.  The sauce was even better less salty, but full of great savory flavors, with out the typical west coast sweetness.  They now have cups of water too which is the next best thing to a caffeine, and sugar free drink option.  I don't think they realize they are in AZ and can get labor to bus the tables at a very low rate. This is the only reason they don't get 5 stars. On sat it was some what busy, some tables needed a wipe down yet there was no busser in sight. Also I am not a huge fan of the ASU colors inside, the yellow is just a bit overpowering, and out of place being over 8 miles from campus.  Go in, order a 18 inch cheese pie, even the leftovers are decent. If you like Real NY style pizza you will like this.

Look its a fad and this time I have to do the work and play guess the price!  This was my first venture into the self serve yogurt world outside of 3rd rate work cafeterias. And I did not like it. Many unlabeled toppings, a seemingly chaotic pricing scheme and a unclear method to the madness.  Walk in and a wall of yogurt taps will face you, above each one is a small LCD with flavor and calorie info. There is a stack of large cups at the end of that wall. There is a counter of toppings and staff. Some of the toppings are not obvious on first glance and there were no labes to identify them, nor nutritional info.   at $.39 an oz I had no clue what a normal serving or price was, however for two modest cups I was surprised to see a $8 plus tab, especially considering I had to to all of the work.  Bring back the gelato fad, or the mixed in ice cream fad even, I will pass of this self serve yogurt fad.

The newest Ross in tempe is open!  The store is new, clean and tidy. However the selection is lacking here.   The Shoe dept had much open space.  The art was just a hand full of pictures.  I like the cleanliness, it is much cleaner than the Tempe marketplace location. But more items are needed, I did not find anything to buy.

Don't let the simple name and pick up centric setup fool you, this place has some great food, at good prices and generous portions.  While this place may be west of the trendy side of the 51 and in an unassuming strip mall it still has some decent dining area that accommodated our party of 6 plus 2 kids.  The menu is full of Chinese, Thai and other Asian dishes. The pad se ew was a wonderful with a hint of char and wide noodles, tofu and broccoli.   Adding to the great food is their wonderful chill oil. There is also a small selection of random Asian goods like chopstick helpers.

It is magic that in this modern age that the noodles are not mass produced very far from my table.   One of the fun aspects of this place is the window in to the kitchen where they pull noodles. I had my back to it and managed to get a good amount of sauce on my short trying to catch a glimpse of the noodle artists in action.   The menu is a pretty good size, however there are only 3-4 vegetarian options.  The waiter was nice enough to make a few recommendations and modifications.   Prices are low about $7 per dish. The dishes are a bit on the Smaller side for us big Americans so if you have a few people get 1 extra and share.  We had the veggie noodles and noodles with sesame paste. The veggie ones were quite familiar with the wake taste beansprouts and other veggies  The one with the sesame paste was great, but could have used a veggie to offset the texture.  bottom line fun place good food but limited veg options.

This is a pretty cool venue, Relatively close to town just just off the road there is this ranch. Run be friendly people where you can do some western things. Horse back rides. Fires with s'mores, practice your lasso.  The entrance can be hard to find at night, just make a left at jomax and then the first left.

If you want to try a few new flavors and textures this is a great spot. If you are vegetarian be prepared to have a ton of carbs.   Your meal will start with and amazing dish that is not popcorn, or cornuts but some magical in between.   They also have a punch that is made with corn and spiced, it tastes like a sweet apple cider sans the apples.   As for my main dish I had one that was tofu with vegetables and rice (Lomo Saltado Vegetariano) IT had some nice flavors and texture, it came with a pyramid of rice.  The Tacu Tacu $11 while being a carb bomb of beans rice and corn was the winner for me.   We also had some fried yucca as an app, they are like french fries with some great dipping sauces.

It's all about the bread and what is around the dog, not the dog it self.  I finally made it down to the mobile food court on a Friday and was not distracted by another truck.  I oped for a veggie Moki A veggie dog with into beans, cheese green chillies and a mayo based sauce. What made it was the great soft flat bread and the toppings as the veggie dog it self was a bit bland and had no character.   As I side I went with an order of veggie corn pups. Which are balls of cheese covered in con batter and fried, all on a stick, they are heavenly.  All of this for $7  I tried some of my friends fried pickles. They were just too sweet.  Check them out at this location most Fridays from 11-1

I like selection and options, and this is somthing you will find here, including many vegetarian (but not vegan) friendly options.   Thew cuzine is a bit new to me, so please forgive me if I forgo the formal dish names. We had a veggie pot pie, with Cauliflower, zuccini and mangego with a great pastry top.  A Garbanzo beand and spinach pesto dish, Veggie paella and more.  Overall I liked the flavors, textures and presentation. The prices of the tappas $7-9 was a bit high considering how many one would need to make a meal. It is also quite loud here with the flamenco music so don't expect too many deep conversations.

In a off the beaten path, semi rennovated wherehouse is a brewery. They have a patio outback in the lot where food trucks come and inside there are tables and a stage.  The music was a bit too loud for my tastes but I did like the patio and the beer. The vibe here is "super chill" and prices are good too.   You have no reason to avoid this place as it is quite enjoyable, bring ear plugs if you plan to sit inside.

New location, longer lines and busier kitchen.  I was a big fan of this place at their old location, the new one is a bit far for me, but the parking situation is much improved.  We walk in the door and encounter a line out to the door, the line is moving very slowly as the phone and the orders on it seem to take priority over us. The menu is the same, wraps, bows and salads. Many veggie options, in fact most wraps can be made with tofu for $.50 extra.  A $8 wrap includes one side, fruit, pasta or chips. Not cheap but not bad.  I had my usual favorite The fin, Ahi tuna mango rice in wrap form. This time I was not all to happy as my tuna was over cooked until it was hard and dry, I did like the seasonings on it. The tortilla was also a bit hard and could have benefited from a bit of steaming.    On the hot sauce side of life there is Tobasco, Couloua and Siriacha on tap.  Drop in early or be prepared to wait, and wait,  and wait. Even if you call in your oder you must wait in the line.

Coffee, crepes and cool hipsters, You can have a taste of all there with just one stop here.  Inside of a old house is JoBot, Prices are decent service is quick and nice and the crepe did not skimp on the basil. Prices are like all coffee shops which means not a great deal but I guess you pay for the experience.  Inside are a few tables and chairs and a old upright piano. Outside are school style picnick tables which could really benefit from a back. Or maybe I am just getting too old to sit here.

Urban is a colloquialism for limited parking.  My urban dining adventure began with parking on a small cement slab two plots over,  the adjacent lot is fence off.   Walk in and you are met by a counter with a chalk board menu on the wall that has like 5 or 6 sandwich options, garlic fires and cake.   I came in for a spinach and egg mushroom as I saw on their online menu for $5. However they were out of mushrooms. Seeing my disappointment the chef offered me a a off menu creation. A egg, potato, spinach and roasted peppers sandwich.  It was pretty good, the fried egg added a nice fat component to the clean taste of the veggies, and the challa roll bread was a nice soft compliment. ($5)  For a side my co worker and I split a sack of garlic fires ($2) Honestly I did not taste the garlic, however the fries them selves were perfect, crisp golden and not greasy at all. IT came with a side of aoli which I would guess was a turmeric curry style.   Seating is limited to 6 bar stools at a window counter inside and 5 cement pick nick style tables under a covered patio.  Available condiments include sriracha, choula, tapatio and tobasco hot sauces, so not ketchup for you fries. Be a man use sriracha.  My co worker had a jerked chicken sandwich ($6) that he liked but, wished it was a bit larger.

This plays says what it does, and does what it says.  The Thai here is tasty.   You have to have good Thai in this part of town as there are 3 other options within a mile of here.   Their lunch menu has all of the favorites, plus a few Chinese dishes like orange chicken. For most dishes tofu is an option which I really appreciate. For lunch dishes are 6.95 (for tofu, chicken or beef) and a buck or two more for seafood options.  The meal includes Soup, or salad. I had the salad and the simple oil and vinegar dressing was great. A small veggie spring roll and rice if it is not a noodle dish. The rice comes pressed in a nice flower pattern.  I opted for the spicy noodles to tofu, Thai Hot.  I was glad that Thai hot here really means hot not just semi spicy, the dish was good, but not the best ever it seemed a bit dry and could have used a bit more sauce.  Overall this is a solid pick for the area

$7 for a small Styrofoam bowl of bland white mush atop rice.  Can you tell I am less than thrilled and my negativity only grows with my hunger just 2 hours after my "meal."  It was another food truck Friday in down town Phoenix, the number of trucks grew since last year and Hey Joe was one the new ones to me.  From glazing at the menu the only veggie option was the Vegan Mungo for $7 so I went for it.  It came in a small white Styrofoam bowl, looking anemic, like babaganoush with a few leaves of spinach.  I was hoping for more flavor, but it was not there. The texture was like a Indian lentil dish.  Why was this $7 it should have been 3.50 at most. Sure it came from a truck with modern graphics on it, this does not mean it is instantly gold. Trucks may be trendy but so far the food quality has yet to impress me.

Pablanos a spicy name for a place of odd contrasts.   The food is gourmet style, but there is a drive through. There are LCD screen menus and a register to walk up to but they wait on you at the tables, the prices are a bit high, but you are in a low rent part of town.  We walked in and when the cashier / hostess / drive though attendant / waitressed asked if we were dining in or to go we said for here. She said sit and I will bring you menus.   Looking at the menu there is no lunch or dinner, just many items that range from $6-$12  The meal starts with complementary chips and salsa, red and white chips with three types of salsa. Oddly on refill the chips went from wide strips to narrow ones. The salsas were all good and the chips were fresh too.  I went with a veggie burrito $6.49. It did not have exactly what the menu listed in it bu tit did have a great flavor, a richnesses and attention to detail, even the carrots were waffle cut.   Overall it was great with the soft tortilla and the fancy cut in half on a bias presentation. It was bit greasy for the health conscious.   Mexican food is not a rare commodity in this part of town, it takes a brave new concept to give it a try here.  If you are in the area and want some different style Mexican options give this place a try.

I boogied on in for a pre-grand opening lunch and was pleasantly surprised.   Often when a great little places branches out and goes in to the pseudo chain food business some flavor is lost, but not in this case.  For the launch party we had a special menu with limited options which meant i was forced to try something other than my usual favorites.   We started with the cheesey bread. Garlic bread covered in cheese, what is not to love with a side of marinara. If it were up to me this would get a bit of browning time under the salamander.  For my main I split a deep dish with mushrooms. It was pretty good very different than the usual thin crust I get. But be warned a deep dish takes 40 min plus to cook.  We also had a salad with fried onions on top, it had a sweet and spicy dressing that was very interesting, the hot fried onions on top did heat up the lettuce a bit so a chilled plate would be a good idea next time.  What does look great about this spot is over the original one is the ample parking and patio full of fire pits and places.  So go check it out I can assure you a few hundred others will be there, so be prepared to wait.

Great ambiance, good location, decent food and mediocre parking.   Down town had been lacking a trendy nuvo take on Vietnamese food, and this nicely fills the void.  The menu is full of rolls $4-$5  Bhan Mi's $8-10 and Pho` .   I opted for the vegetarian bhan mi with tofu and shitake mushrooms. $8 it came with a side of sweet potato fries.  I like the idea however in practice the sandwich was a bit dry, I  mostly got bread flavor and it would have been nice if they cut it in to two smaller hand sized pieces instead of one long roll. The fries were done well which can be hard for sweet potato fries and came with a aoli and ketchup. Really its 3.5 stars.  There also is a nice bar and they do have a hppy hour where rolls are $1 off.

Bahn Mi oh my, what a flavor explosion. Luickly I was seated outside for this blast of flavor.   I visited the Windsor at 8:30 on a weeknight and it was surprisingly busy, but there was no wait.  We opted to sit on the patio, which ot my surprise was nicer than the inside dining area. Wooden booths and tables, padded chairs and corrugated metal shade complete the contemporary urban patio  The menu has salad, and various burger like sandwiches on the menu, which on the surface is nothing interesting, the sides list is quite eclectic, there is the traditional fries, and the less traditional,  Kale chips, fried okra, mac & cheese, sweet cabbage salad and more. at $3 each I think 3-4 may be a fun snack meal.   I went with the Halibut Bahn Mi, ($13) Their take on a Vietnamese favorite. S soft round bun housed a perfectly cooked piece of halibut, an assortment of greens, and a flavored mayo. It was spicy, fresh and hearty, I highly recommend this. With any main dish you also have a choice of side. I went with the fried Okra, which was delicious, crispy, not soggy like Okra can easily be, and the batter had a great flavor. It was in perfect bit sized pieces too.  My table also got a salad ($9) with salmon ($3) note the salmon is smoked. This was good but nothing too special.    A small dish of pistachios is delivered to the table as a complimentary app, it is a nice protein packed treat.   The service was also great, I had just finished a spin class and was drinking water faster than a elephant, however my glass never went lower than 1/3, even after 10 refills. This was even more surprising as usually patios are the black hole of service.

If Pizzeria is in your name you should do pizza really well, unfortunately Spinato's does not.  We walked in, friendly staff, newly remodeled dinning room, comfortable booths, and a large menu.  We opted for a Plain cheese pizza, and a small calzone with black olives, mushrooms and the "optional" ricotta.   The pizza, was sub par, the crust was like that of a frozen take home pizza, the sauce is sweet and that is the only flavor note no spices etc, the cheese was ok but overpowered by sweetness of the sauce. There are many better options.   The calzone, is really a Stromboli, I wonder why the ricotta is optinal as it would be empty without it. The sauce again was sweet, the ricota and cheese was lacking in volume and the crust was more of a pastry style. Again there are better options.  I can on and on why I don't like the food here but you get the point, the flavors and textures are not what I want from pizza.   Plus I like my pizza sliced not cut into squares.

Simply put it was music in my mouth.   I was glad to see the menu here with items I have not had since I had last visited the middle east. The flavors were quite authentic.  It is also nice that the place is 100% vegetarian so I can eat anything on the menu.   What blew my mind was the soft puffy in house pita. They were just amazing.  On the menu itself you will find middleastern dishes like pitas, some Itailain food and a small bit of fish.  Our meal started with the labne 6.96 it was tart with a great savory taste from the zatar and olive oil, and of course that pita. $9.95  We then had a sabich pita, again great flavors with the hummus, eggplant and hard boiled egg.  We then had a salad with a grilled cheese (Halumi).  The grilled cheese was great, however the salad it self was nothing special. $11.95  Note this place is kosher which means it is closed Fri night to sat evening.

Best Falafel in town!  This might seem like a brash statement for those of you who do not know me. Falafel is my thing, I have had some incredible falafel trips to the middle east and I have been on a long quest to find something as good in the valley. At last my search has found what is looking for.  They key to good falafel is a nice crunch on the outside, and a moist inside with a strong pleasing savory flavor. From there you need a good Pita, moist, soft but still sturdy enough to hold and eat from. Then comes the dressings, creamy hummus and tahini, pickled veggies, even fries if you want (in the pita) this is living!  I also tried many other items from the menu on this trip, my general suggestion stick to the Middle Eastern dishes and you will not be disappointed. The Italian ones were not as impressive.

Super thin crust, fresh mozzarella, and bland sauce. 7-9-5 would be the scores respectively our of 10.  Coal fired, with water adjusted to NY mineral levels shows great attention to the crust. However the sauce while not sweet it lacks flavor it could some some basil, oregano and or garlic. The cheese is great however.   We had a large cheese pizza $18.99 a bit steep but not terrible for a sit down gourmet esque. However due to the thin thin nature and blobs of cheese there is less overall pizza than other thin crust places like NYPD.  This place has a long laundry list of toppings, this is why I think the sauce lacked flavor as most don't miss it when they add on a whole meals worth of meat and veggies to a pizza.  The menu is simple salads pizza stomboli's and desert.   Overall its a decent option for a nicer pizza in this area of town.

There is a Thai party down town and everyone is invited. Everyone needs to be to support 3 Thai options in a square block especially in a area that is mostly quiet after 5:30pm.  All thai'd up has a very similar lunch menu to the other offerings in the area, similar feel on the inside and pricing as well. The one thing I noticed that was different was the soup, which had a splash of Thai curry in it. It was a good touch even if it is not true to Thai soups.  I had the spicy noodles with tofu and veggies $8. It came with soup and  a small veggie spring roll. It was good with fresh veggies, wide noodles and flash cried and then sliced tofu, but it was nothing special compared to elephant or basil.  My coworker had a beef dish, he was impressed with the quality of the meat in the dish. This may be the deciding factor for some if you eat meat.   Bottom line, give it a try, if there is a wait (all tables are thai'd up) check the next Thai place around the corner as thy are all similar.  As a side note, ever notice how most Thai restaurants have Thai in the name? I find it odd.

This is one habbit I don't think I will be picking up. While it may not be a bad habbit I think there are better ones to be had.  Inside it looks like fast food a counter, menu above condiment station and tables, But here you get a pager Vs a call, and the prices are a bit higher.   I had a albacore tuna sandwich, $5.75 a thin slab of tuna on a huge bun with tons of tartar sauce and lettuce.  It was not bad but I like fish and don't need to only taste the sauce.   For a side I had the onion rings $1.95 they were not special at all with a breadcrumb type coating and thin onions inside.   Overall I was unimpressed and the vlaue was not quiet there.

If you want pizza, have WIC benefits to redeem, need a bong, jeans or even a single dinner knife this place has it all.  I came here on a tip about good pizza. From the outside I was skeptical, and once I walked in that skepticism increased as I saw a conveyor style oven.  At 4.99 the lunch special of a 10inch 1 topping pizza, soda, and a bread stick is great deal, so I had to try it. Surprisingly the pizza was pretty good especially for a $5 pizza, It is on par or above a papa john's type of pizza. The service was great too.  They did not have their full menu's in yet just a big lunch and dinner specials menu.  In addition to pizza they also have a friend ensemble of zucchini onion rings and more.  There is a big screen TV with cable and dance music playing on the radio. The fountain drink selection is vast but lacks any diet options.  If you are brave and want a solid value give this a try, if you are on a date and want a second one this may not be the best choice.

Great pretzels and free, good beer and an tasting tasting room.  Art Foosball and beer a odd combo but it works. The location here is a bit odd too but it works as it is off the light rail and a block  from a fish and chips store.   The one real down side is the hours, which means this place is for day drinkers only.   Some of the beers were good some were just avarage.

Genghis Khan could never make it past the great wall of china, unfortunately Arizona's border is not as secure.  We walked in and at 8 pm on a Saturday and I though they might be closing as it was empty inside and there were just two tables in use on the patio.  There is a menu, however you basically then go and fill a bowl with protein and veggies. The bowl itself is much smaller yet the same price $9.99. The veggie options are a bit lacking as some things exists only in a mix, some items were frozen, and others were not well stocked. The sauces are a real shortcoming with a few thick gloppy sauces that you put in to a metal ramekin. As for your "starch" they add the noodles or rice, there is no rice after cooking. The bowl is brought to you meaning you do need to tip.  My bowl was not enjoyable, it was not well cooked with some veggie items still being raw, the sauces were bland despite copious amounts of them, and again the peanut condiment tray was empty.   I will be sticking to YC's or MuShu and I recommend you do the same.

A hidden Tempe gem has opened up a store in cen Pho, and changed my lunch time landscape.  The menu is the same, with sandwiches, salads, bowls and burgers. Prices are $7-9 for most items, a bit steep for the amount of food.  The ambiance is contemporary with a minimalist eccentric interior and staff to with the piercings to match.   My thai peanut bowl was good, the mock meat has a great texture, the sauce was strong but not overpowering and the noodles were cooked well.  We also had the Mexican burger that was great other than that the bun was a bit too large for the patty.

Cute little place, modern with out being trendy. The ecletic menu has manu options for veg and others.  I opted for the top of the line dish, the mahi, with a sweet glaze ontop a bed of hummus. It has a slightly fishy aroma but it was well cooked and the flavors were clean.   For me the real winner here is the falafel fries. They are offered as a side dish and you would be mistaken for not giving them a try.

I do enjoy the fact that this place is not another rubber stamp brewery,  The menu, the patio and even the beers are often a bit different.  From the coffee IPA to the egg and potato bowl to brunch it was not your usual IPA and brewery burger. On nice days the back patio is a great place to enjoy AZ, there even is bike parking.   However there is very little non valet car parking

Giant burritos,  Uncomfortable chairs, limited hot sauce selection and  growing prices.  This review shouldn't be useful to most as if you have had chipotle one place you have had it everywhere. This is the latest location in down town phoenix, it is a popular lunch spot and not a bad option when you need a quick bite.  Their guise of healthy is tempted by the realty that a burrito can quickly soar past 1000 calories. It is nice that they have added brown rice as a option at no added cost.  I had the vegetarian fajita burrito 6.85 Brown rice, fajita veggies, black beans (the pinto are not veg) salsa cheese and don't forget the included guacamole at no extra charge.  Here is a great tip, before opening your burrito, give it a massage, mix up the inside so you don't end up with a bite of pure guacamole or rice.    Fir seats you get to choose from small hard wood seats with a back or small padded backless fixed bar stools, both say eat and leave ASAP.   Over all its something to eat that is not bad or to pricey and the location and addition of brown rice makes it a 4 star from what would be a 3 star chain.

It is like taking a trip to a B rated Vegas buffet with out leaving phoenix!  A fancy black slate entrance and fountain lead you in to a dining area complete with fiber optic lamps and a giant one sided buffet.  The organisation of items is weird with Desert sushi more desert then back to normal food.  The sushi is mostly stuff with Krab, there is a wide range of items all the usual's including a few good veggie options, and stuff for the kids like pizza french fries and chicken nuggets.   One down side is the lack of accurate labels, this makes it hard to guess what is veggie and what is not.  Quality was decent service on drinks was great and for a 6.99 lunch we were all pretty happy.   It is easy to split a check here and they have large tables making it a good setting for a large group.

Indian food and buffets are synonymous with lunch but almost unheard of for dinner. And I think I know why, time.  One may eat lunch from 11-1 yet dinner can be from 5-8 that wide range means buffet items may not be as fresh as the should be, and this was the case here.  The palak paneer had a dry film over it from sitting as did the dahl. The flavors of each dish were decent but not the best I have had. I think they were a bit muted for american pallets.  What made me happy was the large number of vegetarian items on the diner buffet ~5  Including pakora, Dahl, Palak Paneer, veggie korma, channa masala and one other dish plus the often over looked salads.  Be sure or order the garlic Naan as it is amazing in both taste and texture.  at 11.99 its not a bargain for dinner but not bad for all you can eat.

I have been here a few times and I am never too impressed.  Scottsdale prices, and odd presentation detract from my overall experience.  The tortilla chips here are whole tostada rounds, meaning you need to break them yourself, they are also quite thick.  The guacamole has a bit too much lime for my taste and not enough spice.  The tacos with veggies could have used a bit more filling.

Great selection and variety with decent flavors but not as bold as others I have tried.  Inside a tired strip mall sits this well appointed indian spot, which was a buffet for our saturday lunch. ~ $12.50 each.  Pick up a plate and some Styrofoam cups for the sauces and get started. It starts with the starch, rice, flavored rice, a polenta like item and rice pillows. Then move on to the soups. After the soup the main event begins, You will fist be greeted by vegetarian dishes that become less vegan to a egg dish a fish dish then the full on meat.   A few dishes here were new to me, like the egg masla, it had a great flavor with the sauteed onion and Masala seasoning.  Next are the name sake of this place, the chutneys which were decent but again not as bold, which may be good if you have a mid-west palette.  The real surprise here was the huge desert buffet, it has the usual galub, keer but it also had items I have never seen like fried bread in a mango syrup and a dal based sweet sauce that is like caramel.    If you want to try a few new items or have a taste for the bland give this place a try.

Unique, disticnt and literly colorful flavors can be found here at quite reasonable prices.  There are several veg options here including the Gulpi. Coliflour with a tumeric and other spices sauce which was just beyond wonderful. It left my foung dancing and my fingers yellow from all of the flavor. It is serverd with their "naan" bread which is much more like a thick tandoor bread.  This was just a quick take out order and I am excited to try everything they have to offer.

I was here on tuesday 11/4 and had an amazing Jack fruit barbacoa tora, The ambiance was a bit odd being in a old house with a swamp clooler blasting at us.   With that said I would go back and tried to a few days later, however them seem to have been locked out due to not paying their rent.   I coudl write more just to tease you but I think I was one of the last to enjoy this vegan jewl.

Much of old town is the same, dark room music lame drinks and 30k millionairess douche`s. I f you can not tell I am so over that scene. However Kellys breaks the mold. It has a nice patio and real cocktails that make use of some unique components.   I was a bit disappointed that my drink came in a glass rather than the copper mug listed on the menu but the Moscow mule was tasty and at $13 it should be.  Music outside was audible but not too loud and the lighting was decent.

Vegan Mexican with a urban funk to it. Should it work?  I dont know. Did it work?  Not really.  We walked in, it was empty quiet and after 20 seconds a surprised guy walked in and greets us. We take out seat on the purple booths and browse the menu while we sip watermelon water. Things got a bit stranger from there.  The menu had many interesting options, but each one we tried to order we found out that the didn't have chips, mushrooms or chorizo, key ingredients in many of the things on the menu. We had to just ask what can we order.  We ordered and waited, as the sun set it became quite dark as no one had turned on the lights. Another customer walked in but the waiter was busy working as a cook. It became even darker as we waited. The other customer finally was given a menu and the lights were turned on, however it was still pretty dark.   Our tacos came, they were a bit small we each had 2.5 tacos I assume the 1/2 a taco to make up for the lack of chips on the side.  The tacos them selves were good, nice flavors crunch etc. for $8-$9 they should be good.  However the other problem sunk in as we were leaving, we were still hungry and after $21 and 45 min we were less than happy.  The next day they had posted a photo to Facebook, not about their food, or a special but look how how our waiter/cook is.     So I guess if you want to look at toned male waiter this is your spot. Otherwise there are many kinks that need to be worked out.

If you are a hipster yet crave the modern trend of DIY frozen yogurt this might be for you.  So its a Saturday night you have you skinny jeans on, ironic T shirt, black rimed glasses and your fixie but alas you are not 21! and the bars won't let you in! and you lack the obligatory mac book to bet let in to the coffee shops, what are you to do?    This is where Twirl comes in.  Retro wood paneled walls a 50's era wood grain tv, laid back chairs and a couch.   Oh yes they have frozen yogurt too, it is nothing special, not bad but can there be great frozen yogurt? The mix ins are standard fair and the check out will be a shock as the price per ounce is high.     They key is to nurse your toppings while you hang out and look hip.

A rotating menu consisting of A wrap of the day and many "sides" which are really dishes in themselves.   It had been some time since I had venture to this little courtyard hidden away from the hustle and bustle of mill. I was glad to see a small shop brining it back to life. There is a covered patio with a few chairs and inside a counter to order at. (this means summer time may be a problem)  The are a few options including a wrap 1/2 wrap with a side two sides or just many sides. Again the sides are well crafted dishes in their own right and not just chips.   I tried 1/2 of a warrior wrap which was filled with pinto beans and cactus in a green tortilla. It was pretty good which is high praise as I am not a wrap fan. The real star was the peanut and bok choy salad I had with my dish. Rich and great texture.   I was also pleased with the prices, $6.50 for a 1/2 wrap and a side is a bargain compared to other local organic veg places.   If the weather is nice, you can't go wrong by trying this place out.

Don't let the nigh club double personality of this place scare you away as there are some solid and unique menu options here.  One of my favorite was the "green dragon balls" they are like an Asian gnocchi, chewy bits of noodle in a spicy sauce. it was great. Another great veg dish we had was the crispy noodle island with tofu.

Huge selection unique items and now many vegetarian options.   Mexican, Chinese, a Thai dish, and dinner (american food including breakfast items) they have it.  On my first visit I oped for the daily special which was a chillie rellno and a drink for $6.99 The chillie it self was quite good, the sides were standard and the hand made soft corn tortilla were amazing.   My coworker had a dish we had never seen before, potato gortia like long patties covered in sauce cheese and chunk of carne asada. ~7.50 which he did enjoy.  My one grip with this place is the price. With tax and tip meals are close to $10 and I would like it to be just a buck or so less for lunch pricing or have a pei wei like format so I did not need to tip.

Good beer and wood fired pizza, seems like a winning concept.   I love micro brews, and this place has a great in house selection. In addtion they have a wine list and brick wood fired pizzas.   The pizza was good, but the dough was a bit bland maybe a bit more water and salt could help this dough be lighter and have a bit more flavor.  My smoked porter was great, nice body, finish and a decent gravity too.   The walls and floors are all hard surfaces so it can get a bit loud in here.

Huge beer selection of rare beers, knolwedgebell and freindly staff, a great patio all add up to a good place.  Beers range $5-8 a glass so it is on the pricier end, however most of the beers are higher end micro brews. Our server was well versed in the brews and brewries which is nice when you are spening as much as a lunch on a single beer.   The patio has many tables as does the inside, making it acceptable for larger groups (6-10 people). There is also plenty of spance to stand around and drink.    They do have a full menu of intresting food items but I was just here to enjoy the beer this trip.

BEST Falafel in town and great Shawarma too!   This is  little store front, counter up front and bar stool seating.  Food ranges fro $6-8 plus sides and extras.   I went with a Shawarma pita $8 upgraded to a lafa +$8 which included all of the salads i wanted in side. I kept it simple with shug and hummus. It Was fabulous, The flavors, the soft lafa the creamy hummus it was simply a divine experience, maybe because this place is also kosher.   We also had a side of 4 falfel balls. They were amazing, a crisp exterior reveal a moist and flavorful interior.

Good value good flavors, mediocre ambiance.  In a unsuspecting old strip mall you will find and international mix of Chinese, Mexican and Ethiopian. Walk inside and the 1980's decore of glass block and an akward stage will greet you. Don't worry too much as the flavors are worth it.  For veggie people the menu (maybe lunch menu?) had 7 options including the old stands like Mizir what and, tikki komen and a dish that was new to me a mushroom wot.  I oped for the 4 item combo, 6.99 A real bargain considering it comes with enough anjera to feed an army and is presented on the same tray that one can feed  4 from. There were 4 decent sized scoops of the food on it. Each had great flavor and textures where appropriate.   Service was a bit slow, however due to the slow lunch hour they staff accordingly. This did mean my drink was not refilled.

This is the hole in the wall Mexican joint of my dreams. Good value, clean, a salsa bar and pretty good too.  The 1.99 fish tacos on special were quite large. The fish was decently crisp on the outside and tender on the insides. It was dressed nicly with the pico and salsas.  For a real kick try the roasted Serrano chilies at the salsa bar they are quite warm.  I salute you Senior Taco!

Down town, Trendy, some what fusion and most of all decent veggie options.  The patio is the nice place to be, inside can be a bit cramped. at $8-10 per dish for lunch it is no bargain but it was decent. I was happy to have a few veg options.    I went for the vegetable Pho' asparagus, noodles tofu and more in a mild veggie broth. Lucikly they have a great in-house chillie oil paste that can make anything pack flavor punch.  The menu also has some bhan mi with a french twist and of course the trendy obligatory sweet potato fries.   Don't come because it is authentic come beacause the taste is good and the scene and location are both nice like the service.

A Mexican veggie option other than a veggie burrito/ taco is that too much to ask for?  Thankfully Otro has two other unique offerings. A veggie torta and the real reason to come if you are vegetarian the veggie paella.   Many of the basics here are similar to their sister location (gallo blanco) the thick quarter round chips the green and red salsas how ever a bit more sour.   The paella was great full of flavor and textures from the various fresh veggies, it was very hot from the nearly nuclear iron skillet it is served in so take your time as it will burn you. It is served with a few token corn tortillas which are good but few in number.  The value was decent I will be going back.

A gastro pub is still a pub, sandwiches, pizza and fired food. Maybe there is a bit of flair to make it "gastro" however the end result is the same.  Come for the brewing part and order food when you get hungry. The Fish and chips were decent but nothing to come here for. The Thai pizza had a odd sweet sauce but the hot spices redeemed it.  As for the beer my porter was quite good.

It is not often I get to try something new. Veg options across the board are a bit more limited, but the Koshari bowl was a great new experience. On paper it may sound confusing, rice,lentils,pasta?, garbanzo beans and tomato sauce topped with onions. But they real keys are tomato sauce which is full of flavor in both mild and spicy form and the fried onions. What don't friend onions make wonderful? And for 5.99 it is a good deal, but I was a bit hungry after so next time I will try the plate which I assume incluides a dip and pita.

Fish Machaca, it may sound weird and when they explain it as steamed seasoned fish as the healthy option you may be suspicious.  Don't be it is an amzing flavor and texture filling with in a simple corn tortilla.   Part of the fun here is the salsa/ slaw bar, Yes slaw 2 types sauces salsa and more to customize your taco as you want it. The sesame chili oil goes best of the fish machaca as anything heavier would mask the savory flavors.    The fried fish was done well too, not over cooked and crispy.  You are are not in to seafood your only option is a quesadilla, but I think this place may get you in to seafood.  My only grip is the price to amount of food. Tacos are $3 each and 2 of them make a small meal.

Last time I checked a flight to Italy was over $1200, and that is a bit pricy to just get some pizza. So why not spend $1188 less, go to Pomo and try a Certified Neapolitan margarita pizza?   Walk in and the place is hip cen pho, concrete floors, a hidden side bar and even a patio. the menu has menu options from salads, pasta to pizza. Some of the pizza is of their own creation and some hearkens back to the original days of pizza, and this is why you should visit.   The crust is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside wit s alight char taste from the wood burning over, the cheese is melted but not oozing, the sauce is not sweet or too acidic, but it has a great flavor. Each bit you will be swept away in the chorus of cheese sauce and wood fired crust.   The more creative pizzas were quite good too, but be sure to order a certified pizza. You may wonder what I mean by certified, there is a authority that requires the size crust thickness and more to meet specs of the original Neapolitan to be certified.  Other pleasant surprises were the amazing home made lemonchelo, Creamy and full of life from the fresh zest. A Fried dough with sugar desert and also great mini canolis which were not too sweet inside a crunchy little package.   There are many big names for pizza in this area of town, however you will be missing out is this is not top on your list.

At least I was able to try this place.  They closed at 7:30 pm on Sat. They had 3-4 veg options for us.  The mizir wat, doro wat and foslia were all great, served with the obligatory angera and a surprise, jalapenos stuffed with a tomato onion mix.  The flavors were bold and spicy, this is not for people with weak pallets, but for ones that crave strong adventures.  For two of us it was $10, so its a bargain.  My few issues were, the ambiance, There are just three tables, large enough for 2-3 people each. some unused coolers along the walls and it was a tad warm inside. (so consider a to go order)  Also the hours I would love to pick up lunch here on a weekday, if only they had some food ready closer to noon.  Next time you want to impress a few guests with some bold exotic tastes get a to go order from here!

Like food from a truck, hate the lines, standing heat and lack of a place to sit, oh yeah and lack of beer? Well then come here as this solves all of those issues. The one issue it still does not solve is: is a hot dog and chips worth $8.50  In a hip urban down town spot which was the easily forgotten tedybertos is Short Leash sit and say, what happens when a food truck graduates to a food storefront.  There are a few bar seats, several 4 person tables and a larger table to accommodate small groups.   The menu consists of hotdogs with unique toppings server on naan bread, and some other items, and even a few dinner only items. There is beer and even a local little it shop to the side.  I oped for a veggie dog in the seasonal style with a roasted pablano and pumpkin cream. I was skeptical but it worked well. I think the veggie dogs them selves could use a bit more character however.  The chips were home made and quite good, maybe the addition of a seasoned salt or aoli would be nice.   If you want to flex your hipster muscles and show off to a guest take them here, then cruize the hood on your fixie as there are a few other spots to grab a drink near by.

A beer garden in a supermarket? What a great idea!  It is not too loud, dark or divey in anyway. Their beer selection is vast and often has some rare options. They even sell growlers with coozies.  If you want food there is a rotating menu, and all of the ready to eat food in Whole Food can be purchased and brought in to eat.   Next time you want a quality beer or just to get some groceries with quality beer gogles give this place a try.

The verdict is still out. Right now this is merely a tap room, and for that I am still confused what style it is going for. The mostly great appearance is somewhat modern yet the ecletic mix of furniture ontrats this. So maybe a funky coffe shop with beer? But no there are several TV's playing sports so maybe it is a sports bar with out food.   Maybe once they have their own brews and this place will solidify and come a better hangout spot but as of now it is a bit akaward. At $5.50 for my nitro amber there is not much value either.

So they finally have some of their own brews and the rice pudding porter is amazing. The Das Alt is decent too as is their IPA. So on a brewing front they are off to a good start.   I am still having issues feeling comfortable in the tap room, I am not sure if it is the colors, or the eclectic mix of furniture or the lack of real windows but it just not a place I want to stay and hang out.  They also lack bike racks which would be a great thing to have.

I liked the crust, I liked all of the options. I liked the flavors I created, I just wish there was either a way to give the non meat eaters more substance or a better value.   While all of my co workers opted for some form of a traditional pizza with cheese sauce and meat I wanted to try a flavor punch.  Pesto for a sauce, bleu and fresh mozzarella as my cheese. garlic and katamala olives as my toppings. It was anything but bland and ready in less than 10 minutes.

Four stars for the beer, the rest was eh.  It was crowded, we could not sit as there was a table of kids playing uno and many other children, in this bar. The food went on tasted as they lack many veg options other than fries.   The beer it self, good flavors for the ones we tries, carbonation was just right and the sugars were well balanced with the hopps.

I returned on a normal day, and behold a table and service!  The beer again was great, I had a stout and it was all a stout should be, very balanced. The food at least my veggie burger was not the best, dry and low on flavor a real carb bomb.   Come in enjoy the bearded men they don't bite and drink the beer, as for eating I would go elsewhere.

New location New format old name.   Indian food is often relegated to lunch buffets and white table cloth dinners.  BSG offers a new take on how Indian can be done.  The build to order layout is familiar for anyone who likes burritos.  Pick a bowl or wrap, rice type, protein type, veggies and sauce and avid the pricey extras.  A meal can be had for ~$7-8  I Had brown rice, tofu, all of the veggies with a truly spicy vindaloo sauce.   This is not the best Indian by far as your protein and veggies do not simmer in the sauce, not is any one part of major note. The real reason for a decent score here is the ability to get some good flavors quickly and at a decent value.

In house beer pub grub in a line. The real fun part here is all of the areas they have to explore.  As I write this review on a 116 degree day I am glad I am not perched atop the bar, but on a nice fall evening I could not think of a better place to enjoy a solid beer (I had the stout) and one of the best all be it pricey bar pretzels. It was nice that the pretzel included cheese and mustard, as I hate having to decide.  I am not sure how I feel about the giant cage of squawking, trapped birds dropping feces to the ground near the entrance however. Also parking was a bit akward on a dirt lot across from the alley entrance.

New location, new menu same name.  First off this is a cafe and juice bar as the food is not just some second thought. There are vegetarian, raw and vegan dishes, salads, burgers wraps quesadillas and more. And now there is ample seating for all. However the patio has yet to open.  My BLT burger was decent, but the patty itself was a bit too carby and dry for my tastes. We also got the browned coli-flour rolls and they were amazing, Great flavors.  Portion size for the prices is a bit small but this seems to be the norm in this segment.    Hopefully they will stay open a bit later for dinner.

The trendy Mexican/taco scene is heating up in phoenix. and at 3-5 per small taco wouldn't you want to be in the game too?  Step in to a overly retro 60's themed inside, from the lamps to the wallpaper you would think you are in Austin powers. The patio is nice despite the terrible metal chairs.   You will be greeted by the obligatory chips and salsa, but it is nice that they don't charge extra for this staple.   The menu has salads tacos burritos and tortas. For vegetarians its pretty much salads, a taco or a burrito. For the best value go for the burrito it is full of great items like mushrooms and roasted veggies all for $8 they will even make it a heart friendly chimichanga for no extra charge.   I tried a trio of tacos that included a side for a grand total of $14. They were good but more of an appetizer than a meal. Luckily there were more chips to gorge on.

SO any food can be made nuevo sheek these days, just put a German style name next to the food, In this case taco haus.  As the name suggest tacos play a large role on the menu,  and there are many small street style tacos with wall street pricing. $3-5 each. There is a civicheria here too, (raw fish cured in citrus with a few garnishes)  We oped for a chiviche of tuna, it was fresh and decent however the grade of the tuna was lower than I expected.  Our veggie taco platter was huge and the real star of the meal and reason for the score. A large selection of grilled vegies and even kale on a platter served with many small tortillas for a great DIY taco party.

The build you own food boom has been growing after the success of burritos and subs. However I am not sure it ports over to Asian that well.  At foosia you start with a choice of rice or noodles(cold) proteins, sauce and then the veggie line. I had the spicy tofu and a Caribbean habenero  sauce. with all of the veggies. The tofu took time to cook and came out and on near the end. Since the sauce is added second most of my meal did not have the sauce on it. The veggies and flavors were quite fresh, however since they were just piled on they flavors did not meld. at $9 for this I was far from impressed.

Don't complain! The flavors here are bright, vibrant and yes spicy. Like many new Indian places they start out with great flavor, people complain and after a year or two they start serving the same mild mush as everywhere else. So please if you love good flavors and spice go here, otherwise find somewhere else.  This place as the name suggest has south Indian food, Which for me means Dosa's and a few new to me menu items.  We had a Dosa filled with a spicy gobi (cauliflower), it was delicious and yes spicy. My one gripe is that for the soup and chutneys they just filled up some small bowls from the buffet line that was set out for lunch.  We also had an eggplant  curry dish that had a "tangy tamarind and peanut sauce" It was good but I could not taste the peanut.  As for the ambiance it is decent, not much different from the last Indian place that was here. Tables Booths cloth napkins and ~ $10+- per dish for dinner and lunch is the obligatory buffet.

You had me when I was offered to try a falafel when I walked in.  So you may know I am a falfel junkie, and this place is not helping. They have falfel, and other items like chicken and beef but veg me just gets the flafel.  The next choice is the format, Plate, Pita or wrap. The plate is by far the best value and great if you have a problem deciding.   You get to pick what "salads" you  want Hummus, babaganush, cucumber tomato, cabbage and more, just get them all. Then sauces Tahnini spicy scug get them on the side. and don't forget that comes with a pita.  One key is to get the falafel fresh, you want it stright from the fryer and not sitting in the line for 20-30 min as it looses the crunch.

Much nicer inside than expected, there is a menu of Caribbean dishes. The prices seemed a bit high for the neighborhood and portion size. My tilapia sandwich was small, and relied on the tartar sauce for most of the flavor. My side of fried plantains again consisted of just a few wedges and they were greasy and soft.  At checkout my bill was wrong as they tried to bill me for the included side.  I probblay will not be going back.

Some of the most unique vegetarian options in town, with lack luster service.  Inside of this old fast food joint is some soild Chinese food. Note they have two menus and some of the best stuff is on the Chinese menu.  The Buddhist rolls, essentially a huge order (8) of mushroom egg rolls, nice and crisp full of molten hot mushrooms.  The Buddhist style vegetable dish has some really unique and fun mushrooms including one that looks like waves.  Overall good food, inexpensive just know that you may have to ask to get what you want as the service is not the best.

What may sound like a joke at first can actully be a prety fun time.  The staff is nice and will help you learn to play.   There is a well stocked bar so you can even have fun off the ice. I think this would be my nevue of choice for a group or corprate event.

Their lunch deal makes this a great place for a special lunch on a budget.  For $10 you get 10oz of just about any beer, of which they have many good ones even made in house. A choice of 1/2 of a serious sandwich and a side. There are a few other options too like tomato soup with grilled cheese.   The Tuna salad 1/2 sandwich I had was tall and large with a thick slice of cheese. The tuna salad had a nice smokey note and was not try or too laden with mayo. Fries were a great trust side.  It was not the fastest lunch but for $10 +TT its a decent deal if you need to escape your day for a bit.

The neopolitan pizza game in Phoenix metro has been heating up. Bianco set the bar and many have heeded the challenge. Classic Italian pizza is a long time Tempe option that has not kept pace.  Despite their new location the pizza and salads fall short. The Baby Blue salad was soaked in dressing, with some wilted pieces of lettuce and only a few chunks of bleu cheese.  The Garlic and Basil pizza was nothing more than a flat-bread light on the cheese and the cust was a bit under done, I really think their over should be warmer. for $11 it was far from worth it.  As for a side of sauce, they will also hit you up for $3.50  The other pizza was unexceptional for $16.    Next time I want high end pizza, I will brave the wait and drive to CIBO or Pomo.

Small tap room, nothing of note in that arena.   As for the  two beers I tried, they were were not good. One was just too sweet and lacked balance, The other was just off.   There are so many options in this segment now, you may want to try a different one first.

As the kosher places go in town, this should be the model. Bright, clean modern and most of all pretty good with a wide selection.   The menu includes pizza, Italian food, fish dishes, sushi and even fries. You may wonder what do fish, sushi and pizza all have in common. And the biblical answer is they all lack "meat"  I tried a pizza roll, a slice covered in pasta and a slice with a giant crust and some fries.   Part of the fun is the new york style ludicrous pizza with odd toppings. The overall taste is decent and prices are great, especially for the kosher thing.  If you are looking for good kosher dairy fair or some unique pizzas check this place out, just don't expect to find any meat.

I did not see many pears on the menu, and it is a bit large to be a "bistro" but I will not hold that against you.  The menu is full of salads, melted cheese sandwiches and pasta, there are several interesting asps too and a few local beers.  The decor inside is a bit eclectic as this space has leftovers of it's predecessors.  A nice feature of the menu here is that most dishes here are vegetarian friendly, then meat, or fish can be added for a few $ more.   I oped for the "Athena's garden" A pesto linguine with a few veggies in it. It was light despite having a fair amount of oil. We also tried a salad that was well assembled and fresh.   The real winner for me was the creamy mushroom Marsala, There was cream but not an excess just enough to coat the pasta, The caramelized ions gave it a deep rich flavor and the mushrooms added to the textural delight.   If you are in the area and want a nice, good meal at a new local place give PPB a try.

I really had no clue there was a full fledged brewery restaurant on the edge of civilization.  You will find the standard brewery food, I had the fish and chips, I really enjoyed the shoestring seasoned fries. My beer was good too and it was made great due to the daily special it was on.  They had some loud live music, maybe it is my age speaking but why must live music be so loud?

Cen Pho is a thai hotspot, I can ramble off at least 5 places with in two miles, so if you are going to jump in to that game, you should be at the top of the game.  Jasmine tahi is not quite up to the challange. My drunken noodles were a bit too soft are not really spicy, the spring roll was crisp but greasy. The odd music and empty tables made this for an akward trip. Also I was dismayed when I went by the kitchen and heard a microwave in use, this may explain the general limpness of my food.  The PadSeEw did not have the wake` char one would exptect.

To settle any confusion this place is next to Zam Zam world foods, they even share an internal door.   For lunch it is a sit down place with a waitress and a menu. The Menu has many familiar Indian items, a few Mediterranean items and the more exotic Afgan items.   I was hungry and went with my Afghan fall back the Gulpi (7.50) A Cauliflower dish with a slightly creamy flavorful sauce. It comes served with Tandor bread which in this case they use Naan and for $1 you can get rice which I did. The rice is pretty intresting in itself long grain and colors varry a bit. Over all a great dish but a bit more acidic than I am used to.  My friend had a intresting dish that is hard to describe other than it had meat inside dough and lots of sauce. He liked it.  Most items will break the $10 mark with tip and tax so I may not be doing this place for lunch too often.

My expectations were crushed. Phoenix needs a Tucson Tamale like place with a wide selection of fun and delcious tamales.  Alas the Steamed Tamale only offers two, A beef tamale and a corn one. Even more confusing is that by default the non meat tamale comes in a green meet sauce.  The corn Tamale it self was bland and their normal prices are not cheap.   There are a few seats inside and a few dirty tables on the patio. Not very inviting.  This was a one time visit for me.

A all inclusive meal, great hospitality and good food and decent prices. What more could you want?  Sit down and you will be greeted by bread, carrot and cabbage dip like salads, great olives, and an aromatic tea. You did not order this, but it comes with the meal. They are all well prepared and delicious.  You meal choices are simple.  Couscous with your choice of meat (chicken, lamb, beef) or vegetarian(stewed veggies in spice). Price for this all inclusive deal are about $10 +- $3   And by all inclusive  it includes the mentioned dip and bread. small plate of a couscous veggie garbanzo bean salad, tea and even a desert bite.   The service was great too, imagine visiting a family members house and their soul goal is to make sure you eat and eat and enjoy yourself.

I stopped in for a beer with a friend, The beer I had was great, it was a trough good body and no harsh after taste. I am glad they had a stout as many places are becoming IPA only zones and a bit of variety is always fun.   The inside is bright and clean and open, good place to go with some friends or even some family. They have a wide menu I will try the next time I visit.

Best Gobi Manchurian Ever.   For those who may not know some of the best Indian food is really Asian fusion, we oped for the happy hour specials. We had a gobi Manchurian, amazing crunchy battered coliflour in a savory spicy red sauce. Be ware the spice level here is set to authentic and delicious.   We also had the noodles with veggies, Think yakisoba with a bit of an Indian twist and a masala doa. All of the flavors were amazing and spicy.  There is tons of seating so getting a table should not be an issue, it is clean, and service is good. Happy hour prices on chaat and other great items make this a top pick if you like food with some heat.

Want to hang out in your back yard, but lack fancyy chairs, games shade, good beer and the ability to cook?  Don't fret OHSO has all of that and they will clean up when you are done.  This was the prefect venue for an informal gathering to have some beer and a small snack. I really enjoyed their home made stout.    You may want to wait for the temps to dip below 100 before seeking out the patio.

This is a food stall in the desoto market, so if you are lost trying to find the place, find the desoto market first.  The salmon bento box was well prepared, I really liked the glaze on the salmon, however the term bento box should not apply to a plastic segmented container. I wish the BAO were a bit cheaper as they along with a bento would make for a quality filling meal.

The hardest thing you will have to do is picking out what to eat as their menu has so many good options.  The vegan shrimp is a real experience, the texture is quite unique and it worked with the pumpkin peanut curry, another unique dish.   The Seafood clay pot was a ginger shotgun blast to the face, full of veggies glass noodles and mock seafood.  Other dishes like the green curry were great as was the fried tarro. Another nice thing is that this place is nice, clean and modern and a bit more formal than most veg places in town. If you have a vegitairian or vegan date this is the place to go.

Casual Indian food, it seems a bit hard to find but Pastries N Chaat has it,  Just an FYI Chaat are Indian snack / street foods of which this place has many of in addition to curry combo plates, and even fusion style pizzas.  I tried two curry combo plates $5 and $7 that come with rice, parantha (a bread) raita (yogurt) and a token salad.   The curry had explosive flavor and a strong spice note. The paratha was soft and moist. Luckily I had the raita to cool down my mouth.  Anther selling point is the interior, modern and clean, anyone should feel comofrtable visiting.

This veggie po' boy is good as long as you ain't po'. At $7 it is on the smaller size but it does come with chips which is nice. The veggies inside offered many textures and the sauce added a great spice note. I try many veggie sandwiches, some range from bread with condiments only to bread with condiments and avocado. This sub, really had some character and substance.   As a note part of the fun of de-soto is that you can mix and match venors, Get a main at one and a side from another.

The graphics may be 8-bit but the beer flavor is full HD.  Hidden deep in an industrial park is 8 bit, it took us a bit of looking to find but with modern smart phones you wont be too lost.  Walk in and it is a true taproom and brewery, tables a bar and beer, no more, no less. The fire flower table decorations, NES tap handles and 8bit style art had me nostalgic for the good old days.   The beer made me remember how it is nice to be grown up and able to enjoy a quality beer. I tried the dark mage, their stout. It was great, not to sweet or bitter a full body and great flavor, a balance that can be hard to find in the micro brew scene. I decided to use my extra life and switch teams to the white mage, a wit again full of flavor but nothing too offensive or off balance.   This place is fun, grab a few drinks with the friends, maybe not a date place but more of a guys hang out. Keep an eye out for their beer as it is quality.

In side a relaxed hipster style old house is a small bar, that serves beer, beer that they made, and some of the beers I found quite tasty.  Just a few miles south of trendy is WrenHouse, which could be called beer house as it is literally an old house. There is bar seating, a few tables and a few wing chairs for seating. There are the required hipster Edison bulbs, beer and even cold brewed coffee.   I found the Jomax Stout to be truly great, rich and deep with out a burnt flavor, I even tried it with some cold brewed coffee added in and it worked well and was not overpowering.   Pints range from $5-6 and from 5-9% ABV

I am glad to finally have a loving hut in the east valley, one might say I love having that hut near by.  This is a small store front. 3.5 tables inside and 2 patio tables, so don't bring a big group, to go may be a better way to go. They also lack a true public bathroom.  The food was great. I tried the Bhan Mi which was great, fresh bread, veggies and the best seasoned fake meat in town. I also had the spicy soup which was nice but not too spicy, the faux fish balls were nice with an intresting texture.

The cuisine is a few steps up from what you might expect, this is not a ""bertos, or even a generic sit down Mexican place. This also means the prices are a few dollars higher too.   Holding true to their name every tables comes with guacamole along with the chips and salsa. Sure it is literlya thimble full. A cup so small it would not even hold a single dose of children Tylenol would, but it is a nice touch. There is some salsa and a chips too.   I had the chilliie rellno which was quite good. The shape and texture was well defined as was the cheese inside, the sauce was also a good match. The rice was standard the the black beans were a nice touch. all for about a $10 lunch.

Do you hear that wooshing sound? It is the race to fill the void left by chipotle's follies.   Uberito hopes to be the next big fast casual thing in Mexican food, however a few things drag them down.  I had the beer battered cod bowl, Which was a salad bowl with rice, beans, overly salty sauted spinach and mushrooms, and many other usual ingredients, some chipotle dressing, and topped with a broken up piece of fried fish.  My issues start with that fish, it tasted like a cheap fish stick, it has that odd wet batter taste near the fish with a crispy outside, it was so lack luster my son even spit it out.  The sauted veggies were extremely salty,and overall the flavors did not meld all of that well. and for $9 my regular bowl left me hungry.  We also went at a group of 4 other had tacos, and my wife had a vegan bowl, we all got our food at vastly different times.
