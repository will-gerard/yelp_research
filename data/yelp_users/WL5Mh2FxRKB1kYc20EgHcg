One of my family's favorite places! The cheese enchiladas, burritos, and street tacos are amazing! Love that they give you 2 salsas- both of which are so delish! Wish they had beer on draft but the bottle selection is good. Lastly, don't pass up the sopapillas!!!

Appalled at the service I just received! I have only written 1 other review and redownloaded the Yelp app just to tell people about their horrible way I was just treated. I am currently on a no carb diet and initially appreciated the options here. I opted for a veggie lunch special since it included soup/salad with my veggies. Website said they open at 10:30 so I took my lunch break at that time. After arriving, turns out they actually don't open till 11. Fine.. I'll wait 30 min. At 11, I ordered my food to go. After receiving my food, got in my car, I realized they didn't give me my requested spicy mustard and the soup/salad that comes with the lunch specials. I go back in (lunch break about over now) to get my items and was told that soup/salad is for dine in only- not take out. Ok... That's not mentioned online... I would've gotten lettuce wraps or something else instead of just eating $10 worth of veggies. Their response? "Oh well that's how it is" ok... Well, can you give me at least some soup for the false advertising? Of course not! The manager isn't there. But they would refund my $ if I returned my food. Ok.. I have no time to get anything else to eat now. So, can I please get 1/2 my money back since I can only eat 1/4 of the actual food I got? No! They said they'd give me $1! lol A DOLLAR! And the manager wasn't there to speak with.It comes down to this, to keep a customer, do what it takes. This was your fault for not having accurate info on your website! Twice! And you won't make it right? We are talking about $5!!!! If you're looking to spend $10.78 on a cup of vegetables, this is the place for you!
