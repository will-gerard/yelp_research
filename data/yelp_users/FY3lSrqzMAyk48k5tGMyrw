Oh CherryBlossom, you remind me of an abusive relationship.    The first meal I had with you completely exceeded my expectations.  The unexpected bread basket with the nutty banana bread, the savory ramen broth that actually had depth, quick service...  After a couple visits I've accumulated quite a list of offenses: I've waited 45+ minutes because the hostess wrote my name down incorrectly and then skipped over it because she didn't know how to pronounce it, the bomb banana bread was replaced with dehydrated slices of "bread", the ramen noodles were undercooked and sticking together, the sushi rolls did not hold together, and the service was nonexistent.    Yet I found myself going back, over and over again hoping to relive that very first visit.  But enough is enough.    I'm not going to be the Rihanna to CherryBlossom's Chris Brown abuse no mo.

Hot Bagels, always my go to for a lox craving.  Generous portions of salmon, cream cheese, onions, and salty capers that burst in your mouth on your choice of bagel.

It's always a gamble when I stop in at Matt's because the line is unpredictable.  However, the fact that there IS a line should tell you that this place is pretty stellar.  Because I'm a creature of habit, I don't normally order anything besides the special or the hog and chick.  You really can't go wrong with either.  Every dish is made with high quality ingredients.  I always rave to my friends about how the spinach in the special was the most spinachy spinach I've ever tasted (that's a good thing).  Thick slices of peppery bacon = party in my mouth.  Their caramelized onions tossed with perfectly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside potatoes are also a different yet equally awesome party in my mouth.  What gets me every time is their thick slice of toast and organic preserves.  SO GOOD.  And a coffee mug that's never empty, that's always a plus too.  Matt, I don't know who you are but your breakfasts are delightful.

Do you ever have chicken katsu cravings?  If you don't, you're going to start having some after your visit.  What is it I love about their katsu... 1. The ratio of juicy meat to super crunchy panko breading is absolutely perfect, there's not too much chicken and the breading isn't so crunchy that it cuts up the roof of your mouth. 2. It will still be crispy after a 15 minute drive home.   3. The creaminess of the macaroni salad is a perfect balance for the crispy katsu pieces.  Yes it may be cooked beyond al dente, but what do you expect?  This ain't no 5 star restaurant.    I've had other things on the menu but what keeps me coming back is their chicken katsu and super friendly service.

I want to live here. Wait, what?  You're probably thinking I want to live here because of the food, yes that's partially true, but I absolutely love the space.  It's exposed brick walls, lofted dining area, glass garage door and cozy patio...it's what I envision my future residence to be.  Similar to the decor, the menu boasts a variety of comfort food with a modern twist.  Pot roast with bok choy and polenta?  Heck yes, why didn't anyone think of that sooner?  The portions are generous and I've always gone home wtih a box of left overs.  Let's talk liquor.  They have a great beer selection but if you are a fan of sangria, you MUST try theirs.  It tastes as if the citris has been marinating in there for days, which is just the way I like it.   I took my foodie friend from the the big apple here for a celebratory dinner and he absolutely loved it (I know this because his plate was spotless by the end of our dinner).  If it's good enough for a new yorker, you KNOW it's good.   Brunch here was just as wonderful.  The blood marys were strong and the entrees were hearty enough to cure our hangovers.  Again, the portions were large portions yet packed with flavor.  I recommend the baked eggs and their cauliflower soup which was incredibly creamy and not gritty like you'd find at other places.

BYOB.  That alone will get any establishment 3 stars in my book, but luckily Hana had more to offer.  Their fish selection is unbeatable.  Where else will you find striped bass and uni nigiri?  No where.  Trust me, I've looked.  In addition to the quality fish they serve, I appreciate their attention to detail (see flaming sugar cube on the corner of your plate of sushi).  Great service, great food, I will definitely be back.    Word of advice, stick to the fish dishes, the noodles are a bit of a let down.

Romantic, urban and cozy.  Three things I love in any restaurant.    It's a little pricey but a great place to go for a special occasion.  Order the osso bucco, it's divine.  Leave room for dessert, and if you are a fan of sangria, such as myself, I'd recommend ordering that too.  Our server was incredibly polite (as well as the gentleman who didn't let our water classes even get to half full).
