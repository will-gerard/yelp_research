The Anthem Outlets have great options and are a reasonable size.   You don't get lost.  Or spend too much money because you go to a kitchen store and are like OOOOH A kitchen store! and you buy a bunch of stuff and then walk three doors down and you're like OOOOOH! A kitchen store!  and buy more stuff and walk three doors down and are like OOOOH!  A kitchen store! Thankfully, there's none of that.  For reference, please visit the GILROY, CA factory outlets.  Bad.  Bad idea.    Anthem, however, is outdoors, which is probably pleasant all but 3 months of the year, and has a great selection: J Crew, Nike, Harry and David, Pearl Izumi (I'm biased, fact.  I was there to open our store there), Calvin Klein, GAP, among others.  I walked into the J. Crew store and immediately dropped $100.  Helping our failing economy, right?  Food selection is slim.  I don't eat fast food and Subway is meh.  I brought my lunch every day.

Oregano's.  You were pretty damn awesome.  It could have been that I was exhausted and starving, but I think not.  I think you were awesome because my thin crust pizza (my fav!) was delicious, your chianti was a good choice and because my server, Tessa, was great! I had the house salad and a O'Riva Pie and my only regret was not realizing that you do whole wheat crust and that I didn't order it.    By the way, Scottsdale, you are filled with WEIRD people.  The people watching was fantastic and amusing.

I thought this place was pretty ace.    That being said, I scored it on priceline for $60 a night for four nights.  That makes things lots different than when you are paying full price.    Really, I can't figure out why people pay full price ever anymore.  Ridiculous really.  Regardless, my suite was huge, I loved having a full kitchen, the LG flat screen tv was wider than my arm span, the bed was comfy and the air conditioner/thermostat are newer so it isn't one of those ancient hotel room air pushers.  It's real and I could set it to an actual temperature and that made me happy.    My opinion of Scottsdale, and of Phoenix in general, is that it's one gigantic suburbia with great parks and more shopping than anyone in America should ever need.  I guess if you are into that this place is located in a pretty good area.  I'm not.  I'm more into parks.  It was still in a pretty good area.

I really am not a Chili's fan, but for dinner this was the best of all my options while I waited for my flight.  Thanks for seeming super annoyed that I was your customer, waiter.  And for literally flinging my paper napkin wrapped silverware at me.  Right into my face.  That was awesome.  At least you realized it quick enough and apologized, but you should have never done that in the first place.

Dude.  I am so bummed.  This is pretty much my most favorite restaurant in Dallas and I was SO excited to find that there is one here.  Sadly, it's not the same and the standards are definitely completely different.  I ordered my favorite dish - the enchiladas veracruz - and they came out a bit sub standard.  You see, Cantina Laredo originated in Dallas and in the Park Cities, it's ace.  They are ON it.  The manager always comes by your table to check on you, the service is impeccable, the food is fresh, crisp, and amazing.  In Scottsdale, it was slimy - the sauteed veggies came out mushy and deluged in oil, not sauteed to perfection.  The rice tasted like it had been under a warmer for a while and in Dallas, that is a serious no-no.    I passed up on some other choices to eat here and I wish I hadn't.  Who knows what else I might have discovered.  Oh well....

Clearly I made a serious mistake taking these reviews at face value and not reading the other reviews these people wrote.  Clearly their idea of good food is not my idea of good food.  Clearly some cross referencing should have been done.  While I ate here twice - once at lunch, once at dinner - my experience was varied and mediocre at best.  Lunch was the better of the two for a few reasons - I ordered it to go and I remembered to get my salad dressing on the side.  The worst thing ever is over dressed salads and generic restaurants are infamous for it.  This place is no exception because at dinner the next night I forgot and my side salad showed up a soggy mess.  My marinara at dinner was cream based which is disgusting and also extremely over dressed.  I would have been better off ordering no marinara and just the sausage and plain spaghetti noodles.    Over zealous dressing fail.

There are two things Scottsdale has going for it: 1) great parks (McDowell Mountain Preserve) and 2) amazing public pools.  There are 4 here and of them, I visited this one twice.  With two huge pools, including a diving well, it is lap swimming heaven and in the summer, I'm sure, kiddie heaven.  The pool was heated to a perfect 81 degrees - great in the chill early morning air in March.  I was sublimely happy swimming with the Scottsdale Masters Team (thanks for having me!) though those people swim really really early (5:30 AM!  Ouch!)

OH MY GOD THIS PLACE IS GORGEOUS!    What is wrong with AZ that no one has yelped this place?  I LOVE it here.  I spent every morning as the sun was rising running on amazing slate rock and dirt trails, surrounded by cacti and rolling hills.  I could run here every day!    Take Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd east to Via Linda.  Head east on Via Linda to 124th.  Head North east on 124th to the Lost Dog Wash Trail head to park.  If you follow Lost Dog Wash trail you end up at the Taliesin overlook with a view of all of Phoenix and Frank Lloyd Wright's house.
