TOO BAD IT'S CLOSED!  Best Lemonade Around!  I weep for their fresh squeezed lemonade made with sugar cane syrup with sugar cane sticks to chew on.  (And they would bring you a 'side shaker' full of extra - like when you get a really good milkshake at a soda fountain!)  I used to love the Cuban sandwich, even though it made you feel like you needed a nap afterwards!  Why they got rid of this chain when there is such CRAP around here that should close down is beyond me...

A pleasant find in Historic Downtown Chandler!   A lovely space with an interior stone wall, wooden beams and an inviting bar area.  While it took a little time for any server to appear, despite the fact that they were not very busy, the food definitely made up for any delays.    We started with the Cozze e Vongole Saltate - tender sautéed clams and mussels in a delicious garlic broth.  (The female busser keep us well plied with bread to sop up the flavorful broth - but be careful not to fill up too much on bread!)  The salads (Insalata Mediterranea & Insalata Pugliese) were excellent due to the fresh mesclun greens, wonderful cheeses and high quality balsamic and olive oil.  We all had different variations of veal - Saltimbocca alla Romana (tender scallopine with prosciutto in a rich buttery sauce), Vitello alla Griglia (an expertly grilled marinated veal chop - basic but exquisite), and Involtini di Vitello (mozzarella and prosciutto wrapped in veal with a rich sherry sauce with sautéed mushrooms).  The Involtini was especially terrific and our server's favorite recommendation as well.  The vegetables that come with the dinners are also quite good - a mélange of carrots, red potatoes, cabbage.  Even though we had finished our veal, we thought about bringing the extra vegetables home!    I am always looking for places that are kid-friendly that are not chains.  They were very accommodating to the 10 month old we brought with us, too.  Save room (or take home) the tiramisu: it is unbelievable!  Cappuccino was even noteworthy.  Despite the typos in the menu (pet peeve of mine) and even PRINTED on the beautiful wall of the restaurant (i.e. "receipes") - (*gasp* - okay,  HUGE pet peeve of mine), La Stalla Cucina Rustica is a welcome star in a slew of mediocre Italian restaurants in the valley.

All Style, No Substance...  For all the hype about Olive & Ivy, the food doesn't measure up.  Not sure where the 5 star reviews come from.... not the food for me, nor the service which alternated between crabbiness and nervous hovering. Our patio server didn't want to transfer our check despite the fact we never even received our drinks on the patio before being seated in the restaurant. Our dining room server lingered by our table incessantly, seeming to not know when to approach or interrupt us.   The food was... eh. Although the scallops were cooked perfectly, they had zero flavor.  The spinach was bland and pointless: not cooked, not raw, with some flavorless broth just splashed over. Could that possibly be the sherry syrup? The dish boasted wild mushrooms (two) and crisp pancetta. Is that what those three tiny chunks were? The lemon aceto on the halibut was excruciating. The tuna tartare was absolutely flavorless. Where was the Red Chile Aioli? The pesto flatbread was perhaps the most edible thing of the evening. The affogatto dessert was described as Vanilla Gelato, Stream Lined Espresso and Kahlua Cream. I didn't mind the puddle of espresso with vanilla ice cream melting in the middle but the unsweetened cream on top...? ick. Where was the Kahlua?  Sangria was tasty, but despite paying for a $6.00 large Pellegrino, it disappeared from my table and I only received half a refill. I only drank 1/4 of the bottle, wherever it was.   Cougar alert!!!  Olive & Ivy remains open for its feverish cougar bar scene and patio. It's a shame that the food doesn't merit the incredible building it is served in.

Their new space is SO much better than the old one.  Love the new digs.  I love the way the yarn is organized and it is easy to shop.  Okay, that's out of the way.  Let me just tell you about the most recent visit.  Here's the thing: I'm all for someone trying to help me find something.  Service is very important.  But it's a fine and treacherous line.  I don't want to be ignored ALL the time (like at Arizona Knitting and Needlepoint) or not told helpful information should your store not happen to have what I need (see Knitting in Scottsdale), but your TORSO lodged in my throat is very, well, GAGGING.    My mom and I went in to find some Cascade 220, knowing they have a huge supply.  But my mom wanted a particular color because she is short a skein (what is it with patterns and after-the-publication "errata"?).  They did not have color 8885.  What ensued was the LONGEST, most OVERBEARING explanation and apology and struggle to remedy the situation I have ever experienced.  KEEP IN MIND THIS IS THE ABRIDGED VERSION!  "No, we don't have that color, but we could order it, and we may have previously carried that color, but we don't now, and the colors always change, but we can usually get the color you want, so we may have had it before, if you remember when you got it, maybe we could find out when we had it, but we don't now, but we could probably get it, and when do you need it? so we can order it, it's just that the colors change and right NOW we don't have it..."  HOLY CHRIST!!!!  Okay, I had to LITERALLY walk away.  But we were followed.  Now there were two of them.  With the same long-winded explanations.  And one of them had a broken leg and was wheeling herself around on this trike contraption everywhere.  (I'm sorry, yes, I'm intolerant, but SERIOUSLY, can't SHE sit at the cash register and do nothing and ring people up instead of that guy who never moves from the cash register where he does nothing and rings people up?  YOU'RE IN MY WAY!!)  Then there was another long explanation about postage ($4.80 to ship one skein of yarn to us?  we laughed).  I told my mom to stop talking and change the subject because I couldn't take it anymore.  So my mom got some cute patterns, but Tempe Yarn doesn't actually carry the yarns that the patterns call for.  Hmm.  Why so prominently display the patterns then?  I have said it a thousand times, YES, stores can't carry every possible yarn and every possible pattern.  But USUALLY if there is a big display of, say, Berroco books, you have the Berroco yarns.  Not here.  I did get some cool Misti Alpaca Super Chunky.  But I don't have enough.  So I called.  They don't have anymore.  INSERT LENGTHY EXPLANATION HERE.  ("What we had on the shelf is all we have, but we could order more, but the DYE-LOT....")  I don't know why I asked about the friggin' needle I needed.  Sigh.  There goes another twenty minutes of my life that I can't get back.    Decent product.  Not really any bargains.  I just can't take the overbearing service.

Good God, I hate this place.    Why do you go, you may ask?  The answer?  Many of us have them: crazy in-laws.  In-laws who all live in WAY east valley (just call it what it is, PINAL county).  And they ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS pick Serrano's for dinner functions.  It really has been the only place out there for a long while as Christina A. says, but thank goodness more options are arriving, because neither I nor my intestinal tract can take this place any longer.  Start your meal, if you dare, with the baby diarrhea bean dip.  As for anything else on the menu, close your eyes and stab a finger: it is all the same anyway, just different shapes, or layered differently, flat instead of rolled, folded instead of encased... IT DOESN'T MATTER, it barely qualifies as food anyway.  It's not even cheap enough to be worth it.  Ugh.    Save yourself.  Save your in-laws.  Just say NO to serraNOs.

Oh, Jessica Knits, how I wish you were CLOSER.  If I didn't have to drive all the way to North Scottsdale to see you, I could buy another skein of yarn while I was there!  Prior to the arrival of Knit Happens, Jessica Knits was THE nicest knitting store in the Valley.  Don't lament, it is STILL 5-star and STILL on a par with Knit Happens.  (Okay, maybe even higher.  I'm just giddy that Knit Happens just opened and is so close and easy to get to.)  Jessica Knits sells only THE highest quality products.  AND they are the ONLY store in the Valley (OR TUCSON) that carries this much Rowan product.  For that, they get six stars.  Their website boasts "Jessica Knits is excited to be your Rowan Stockist for Phoenix and the East Valley."  That they are.  But don't leave out Twinkle, Teva Durham, Louisa Harding, ggh (yay!), Colinette, I could go on and on.  Check out their website for their product list: www.jessicaknits.com.  They have an EXHAUSTIVE selection of books and patterns.  The first time I went there, I brought this embarrassingly long list of pattern books I wanted to look at.  Seriously, there were over 30 titles.  They asked me if I was looking for anything in particular, and I shyly blew it off and said, "Oh just looking for a couple of books."  She just about snatched the list from my hand and told me to go look around, that she would find any and all books they carried, and start me a stack at the table to look at.  Oh my God, I love this place!!!  I pored over books and she kept bringing more to me.  I felt like Morgan Freeman in the library in "Seven"... (only Bach's "Air in G" wasn't playing...)  Okay.  Their stuff is beautiful.  I've purchased gorgeous Colinette Giotto there, Elsebeth Lavold Silky Wool, Rowan of course, AND they support my super chunky habit (they carry Twinkle).  Made a super cute purse with some Cascade Magnum.    Staff is AMAZING.  The store is small, but very shop-able with the amazing amount and variety they have.  Definitely get on their email list as Megan M. said, to hear about trunk shows and specials.  They actually have great sales, too, where you can find some steals.     I know it's a drive, but seek out Jessica Knits.  It is fabulous!  WARNING: check their website for when they are open - they have weird hours, especially in summer.

Wow.  I'm surprised by the eager 4 and 5 star reviews of this place.  Flat out, this place scares and horrifies me.  For many reasons.  Mostly because when any number of my in-laws pick a place to go, it's either this place or Serranos (see my other review)... friendly game of Russian Roulette, anyone?  The other main reason I hate this place is the fact that I have to shower when I get home.  The whole family congregates in the laundry room and we all strip.  We leave everything piled in the stench of burnt food and smoking wood and we take showers to get rid of it.  There is nothing worse than your pillow the morning after San Tan Flat if you failed to take a shower when you got home.  I don't understand the whole stand in line to order thing.  Is it a sit-down restaurant?  Yes.  If you eat inside and can actually get a table.  Is it a "fast-casual" like Pei Wei?  Kinda.  You stand in line, but no one brings you your food.  So really it's fast food?  You place your order and go get it when your number is called?  Yeah.  But it's a steak and it is ANYTHING but fast.    Speed alone (or lack thereof) is reason enough to stay away.  I don't wait for food.  I don't care how good it is, a wait this long is unacceptable.  Oh, but it's not even good, I forgot to mention.  Actually, my husband and my food came out quickly (20 minutes - and we ordered steaks) - everyone else in the extended family ordered burgers - OVER AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTE WAIT -- FOR A BURGER!!!  Did I mention the food's not that good?  And half the menu is very over-priced.  They should stick to the cheap stuff: it is all anyone orders anyway as evidenced by the run on burgers that caused oppressive delays.  Then there is the salad bar -  I'm surprised it passes health code.  See those tongs that are laying ON TOP of the lettuce?  You do realize that everyone else in the place has had their greasy little paws on that handle that is in direct contact with the pile of lettuce?  icky poo.  And then there are the fire pits.  Has OSHA been here?  Good God, this is such an accident waiting to happen.  It is SO friggin' dark out there, there are all these raging fire pits, kids running everywhere, all these odd obstructions that are 'ambiance' - barrels, wheelbarrows, just waiting to be tripped over.  Did I mention a young woman was taken from this place (some say kidnapped is a better word) and killed?  That's not on the advertisements, is it?  Another ugh from me.  What a great concept gone horribly awry.  Queen Creek, how you need some great restaurants.  More power to those of you who love it, but next time the in-laws schedule a get together here, I'm calling in sick.

Oh my goodness, I wish there were more stars to give.  Six?  Seven?  Does this mean I have to knock some stars off my other yarn store reviews?  Maybe.  Just maybe.  Knit Happens just "happens" (eek) to be the most gorgeous yarn store I have seen in... well, maybe ever.  It is the most spacious, shopable, and beautifully laid-out store I have been to in the Valley.  Upon entering, a zen-like calm descended and I felt immediately I would be coming here again... and again...  I was worried because I had a hard time getting them on the phone.  I kept getting a FAX machine, then a message, then a FAX machine again and I was concerned they weren't really open.  When I finally got to speak to someone in person, I was a little more concerned because the woman seemed a little confused by my book request.  But then, they've been open less than a month and I was looking for a particular book... but they had it and put it on hold for me.    I had already decided I would come again, if ONLY for the covered parking.  Much appreciated in the first week of September in Phoenix.  That it was simple to get a stroller in there was another plus.  But the toys for my three-year-old!?   A lot of craft stores have a handy bucket of old, cruddy toys that are at least 'new' to your little ones, but this was a SPREAD.  Kid-sized table and chairs, coloring books, blocks, legos, hobby horse, a huge bucket of dinosaurs of all kinds, etc.  Yeah, I'll be back.  I can't get my kid to leave!  But I came for the yarn.  And yarn they have.  Not a crappy, acrylic brand in sight.  GORGEOUS stuff.  They have TONS of Debbie Bliss yarn and patterns, all the Sublime books and yarn, a lot of Tahki, the new Teva Durham yarns, a great Mission Falls selection.  Some great recycled yarns I am not familiar with... I could go on and on.  This is high-end, fashion-forward, beautiful stock - the only store that comes close to this kind of yarn in the (NORTH) Valley, in my opinion, is Jessica Knits, which is just so damn far away...  I am a yarn geek, in that I like to surf the web and find new yarns, and I love to be surprised at a yarn store, which I certainly was here.  I had a hard time committing to a project, there were so many beautiful yarn choices, and fantastic pattern books, too.  Staff was FANTASTIC: friendly, not horrified by my kids, so accommodating and not overbearing as some other stores.  5 stars for them, too.  The store, as I said, is very spacious.  A huge kitchen and staff room in back with the kids' play area.  The main store area, beautifully laid out, easy to see the yarn, as I said, very shopable.  There is also a HUGE project table, very cool, that sits probably 8 or 10 people.  Every seat has a sort of cubby (an indentation in the table) that will either hold your ball of yarn, or your drink so it doesn't spill on your work.  There is a room behind the project table with chairs, couch, big screen TV and pattern books and magazines.  You can cozy up, watch the food channel, browse books or stick your non-knitting friend/husband/carpool there to enjoy him or herself.  You've got to go to Knit Happens.  I think it is SUPERIOR to many Valley stores - only Jessica Knits is in this league.  If you want current, high-quality yarns, fashion-forward project ideas with fantastic service, go to Knit Happens.  The staff said there are tons more new yarns coming in every day.  Can't wait to go back.

Boo.  Hiss.    Okay, despite the name 'bistro' attached, Hong Kong Bistro is only a half-step up from fast-food Chinese.  I grew up back east with the best Chinese place just down the street from me, so I have to try all these close places in the hopes of finding a gem.  Keep looking.    The food isn't ALL that bad, maybe a two-star. I've had worse at Panda Express and other MSG-happy dives.  But the service is excruciating.   They are "under new management" and I tolerated them a lot better when they were brand new and under the "original" management.  I don't know who these people are who are running this place now, but it's a joke.  I went recently to get takeout.  I'm standing there waiting for this uber-creepy guy to run my credit card, and he's leering at me, and he says, "Declined" as the sheet is printing from the card machine.  "What?" I ask.  "Declined," he laughs.  Then hands me the slip to sign.  Humor is lost in the translation.  Then today was a nightmare.  35 minutes for one lunch special and some crab puffs.  This skinny, pimply woman with absolutely no handle on the English language was running around screeching "I new!  I new!" and not helping anyone.  The phone was ringing, customers were coming to the counter to ask for refills...  A little boy waiting when I was exclaimed to his father, "I don't understand anything she's saying."  Yeah, neither did anyone else.    When she was done screaming into the phone repetitively (I guess the guy on the other end couldn't understand her either) and I finally had my order taken, it was like pulling teeth.  She actually got on the PHONE and handed it to me, "Here.  Manager," and HE took my order.  ARE YOU SERIOUS??  Where the hell is he that he can't schlep his ass into the restaurant to save this poor wretch?  When I got my food after 35 minutes, it was cold and awful.  The beef lo main was at least edible, the crab puffs were icy and the fried rice, was ugh, just awful.   And now, to quote Marge from "Fargo", "Just feel like I'm gonna barf."
