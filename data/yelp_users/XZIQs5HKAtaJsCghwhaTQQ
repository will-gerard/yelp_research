Great customer service from Vladamir. Our fridge quit on us which is always a tough situation, but fortunately Vladamir was able to show up within about 90 minutes of placing our first phone call to him. This was great news when every other service provider we called had no same day service available. We ultimately decided to purchase a new refrigerator do to the estimated repair cost.

Just read the other reviews about the big guy with a beard who had a bad attitude, Bob I think is his name. When I came back for a second visit to purchase a bike and asked if he would price match Bike Barn's advertised price which was $40 less for the exact same bike, he got defensive and refused to do so. I was shocked that he wouldn't come down to the price of his competition to make the sale, or at least offer a free tune up for another bike. Was hoping to make a deal at Bike Vibe and become a regular, but will not be returning any time soon.
