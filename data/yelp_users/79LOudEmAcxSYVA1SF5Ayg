Never really been a fan of the food here...and after this visit...i'm still not a fan.  The wings there suck, the beer is over-priced and now most of the girls are not even hot anymore.  Additionally it didn't help that our server was new and didn't smile or look happy to be there at all.  We pretty much had to beg her to smile at least a little.  Don't think i'll be going to a Hooters again for a while, For an overpriced beer and hot girls I prefer going to a place like Tilted Kilt where at least the food is good.

Not a bad little place to go for lunch.  They have pretty good food and decent prices.  I've only been there a couple of times but both times had good service and left satisfied.  Not really else to say...pretty standard bar and grill...  Give it a try...chances are you'll like it.

Just tried to go by for lunch today.  Haven't been in a while.  Shocked to see a sign on the door that said it has went out of business.  Sad to see it go.

WOW!  This place is kind of expensive, but it is good food, great atmosphere and just plain fun.  We went there for my g/f's bday and we had a blast.  The sauces that they give you when you start eating your meats and veggies are sooooo good.  The drinks were not that expensive from what I could tell...I paid $5 for a beer...which is not too bad.  So if you want to go somewhere for a special occasion, then you can't go wrong here.  Just remember to figure, it'll be about $100 per couple...

Let me start off by saying...I looooooove a good pastrami sandwich.  So when a friend suggested of mine said he was going to make a lunch run down there, I checked out their menu and right away told him to bring me back a pastrami.  I must say...I made a excellent choice.  The sandwich was very good.  Plenty of pastrami and cheese.  The pickle spear was a unexpected and pleasant surprise.   So in closing, this review is completely based on just the sandwich, I haven't been inside the shop yet...but when I do get there...I'll update.

I was turned on to this place by one of their barbers, Pete. So I stopped by and was really impressed. Place was very big inside and I didn't have to wait at all. My appointment was at 3pm and when I walled in Pete was there waiting for me. I was offered a complimentary beer during my haircut and that was a great touch. My haircut was great, Pete took his time to give me a good cut, unlike some places where they try and break world records on how fast they can cut your hair... I got a hot towel on my face while and was totally relaxed. I didn't have the time to check out the rest of what they offer there, but I was told the do, pedicures, manicures, waxing and massages... nice place for a man to get away for a good ol' fashion haircut.   Parking was a little rough...but I found one with only having to circle the block once. Just now sure how it's going to work if I am there more then an hour since you can only pay for an hour at a time at the metered parking.

OMG.  I have found the worlds best beer.  It's the one and only Kilt Lifter.  Just an amazing beer.  Four Peaks makes so many great beers, from my favorite Kilt Lifter to the Oatmeal Stout and my favorite seasonal, Pumpkin Porter.  Their beers are so good, that I carry two of them (Kilt Lifter and Hot Knot) at my own pub in Laveen/Phoenix.  The food here is pretty good too, the spinach dip is tasty and so are most of the other apps.  Service is pretty good too...plenty of servers so you'll have someone there to give you the attention you need.  Good luck finding a seat during happy hour, especially Thurs and Friday this place gets packed. The one downside is the parking...or lack there of.  If you get there on a busy day, you may have to park like 1/2 mile down the road and walk to the brewery.  But, with these beers it's totally worth the walk.  See you there!

Wanna get high!!!  I usually don't...but after eating these sandwiches, I wanted to smoke a fatty so that I could have the munchies so I could eat another sandwich.    I eat at Cheba Hut on a regular basis, usually get the Midwest Best or the Pakalolo...both sandwiches are awesome.  Staff is very friendly and decorations are straight out of a Cheech and Chong movie... great place to grab lunch.

Very cool place.  I went there to get some bottle caps for a homebrew kit that I ordered online and they were there to help and answer any questions from the minute I walked in.  I kind of wish I knew about them before I ordered my brew kit online.  I will definitly be going to them for all of my beer brew needs.  They had everything and seemed very educated about all things beer!

A friend of mine plays there on Mondays...so we wanted to surprise him and go watch him play.  So I called about 3pm to find out what time he goes on.  Here's how the conversation went:  Me: **ring ring** Rula: This is Steve Me: Hello is the Rula Bula Rula: Yeah Me:  I was just wondering what time Shelby goes on tonight? Rula: I don't even know.  Probably 9, 9:30, 10 Me: Can you get me someone who can find out? Rula: No, there are no managers here. (He hung up at this point)  I don't know about you, but that was not customer service at all.   So I waited an hour, called again.  This time got a girl.  I knew she would be better then the last guy cause she answered the phone..."Thank you for calling Rula Bula.  How can I help you."  Much better then, "This is steve".   She told me exactly what time Shelby went on and let me know that they serve food til 10p.  So we got there about 8:30p.  Ordered drinks and food.  Was enjoying ourselves until the server came over and told us she was going to have to close our tab because she was leaving.  That is one of my biggest pet peeves, when I am forced to close my tab cause that person wants to go home.  Why can't my tab just be transfered to someone else?    So we're enjoying music and the bartender comes to clear our glasses and my friend ask her if he could have another stella.  She doesn't say anything and just walks away.  15 mins later we're looking for her to find out about the stella, we make eye contact with her from our table and motion for the stella.  She points to the end of the bar.  Apparently she served it when we ordered it and then just left it at the bar and never said anything to us.    I used to like hanging out at Rula Bula, but it seems that lately it's gotten expensive and the service has gone to shit.  I don't know why they tell you that the pints of beer at $4.50, when they are actually $5.50.  I won't go back anytime soon.  I'll stick to Fibbers and The HatRack Pub.

I've died and gone to booze infested heaven.  That's how I felt the first time I walked into Tops.  And trust me, you'll feel the same way.  Tops has so many beers, from your tubing down the river favorites like bud light and busch to your cinco de mayo favorites like corona and pacifico.  They have your "i'm an irish for the day" favorits like guinness and smithwicks to your "let's watch football (aka soccer)" favorites like boddingtons and kronenburg.  From A to Z this place has it all.  The best part is that you're not limited to a six pack of your favorite beer.  You can mix and match beers to make your own variety six pack.  I think good ol' Ben Franklin said it best " Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy."  and Tops is the place that makes us happy.

Really how can you go wrong at Christie's?  Free entry with my spring training ticket and 2-4-1 domestics and wells. Girls are very hot here.  This is definitely not one of those dive strip clubs where the girls have beer belly's and missing teeth.  The girls here are hot, sociable and overall friendly.  None of them are usually pushy at all.  Good way to finish a day after a spring training game.

So I'm watching Diners, Drive-in's and Dive's on the Food Network and they do a feature on this place.  Go on and on about the waffles.  So the next morning, we head over.  Walk up to the building and people everywhere just standing around.  So I walk in side and was stopped by a server and told to step outside.  She handed me a clipboard and walked back in.  Apparently, I was suppose to put my own name down on the list to be seated, so I did.  We waited almost and hour.  We were finally called to head in.  Walk in and can't believe how tiny this place is...they sit the three of us down at a table made for one so we're all fighting over elbow space.  Look over the menu and decide to order a waffle, eggs and OJ.  Server tells me the waffle iron is broken.  That was the only reason I came here because of the so called world famous waffles.  So I settle for pancakes, eggs and OJ.  They bring out my teaspoon of OJ.  Seriously I have never had such a small glass of OJ.  The food finally arrives, and to tell you the truth, it was good but not worth the hour of my life I spent standing outside waiting.  I'll stick to IHOP.

Like Billy Joel said, "Sing us a song, you're the piano man, Sing us a song tonight".  That's just one of the many, many songs that you will find your self singing along too.  This place is so much fun.  Beers are average price for a Tempe bar so can't complain about that, but no where else can you have this much fun listening to someone play the piano.  The one downside is the restrooms...this place get so crowded, like beyond crowded and yet they still only have 1 bathroom with just a few toliets in it...so there's always a line...always.  If you have someone visiting from out of town and want to show them a good time in the tempe area...take them here.

Been there twice!  Both times the food was good.  Nothing to write home about but decently good.  The reason for the 2 stars...the service!  Wow!  Talk about horrible service.  The first time we went we sat for about 20 mins without our server even approaching our table.  We finally had to flag him down and ask him if we can put our order in.  The rest of the visit was more of the same.  Us sitting and constantly flagging the server down for things we needed cause he never stop by on his own.  2nd visit was more of the same...had to ask multiple times for anything we wanted.  Had to flag server down cause he never stop by our table.  My cousin had time to walk to CVS and back before the server came to our table and take our order.  I don't think I will go back.  Service just really sucked.  No one was rude or anything but being constantly ignored was not an enjoyable dining experience.

Perfect Sunday lunch.  That's not a bad way to start a review I think.  We went here last Sunday right before going to the movies.  We ordered the Cold Seafood Combo; it was crab legs, peel-n-eat shrimp, clams and oysters. Plenty of food for 2 people.  It was a really slow there but that's fine by me.  The beer was very good and cold. For the meal for 2, plus we each had 2 beers...it was only about $50.   We spoke to the manager and he gave us a coupon for next months Lobsterfest, buy one lobster get one free.  So of course we'll be back.

So went there last Saturday for some lunch and a beer with a friend.  It was my second time there...but first time I had planned on eating there.   I was disappointed with the menu, nothing really looked good.  So I finally settled on the enchiladas and a beer. While we're waiting for the food I ask the server if we could have some chips.  Guess what chips are complementary anymore.  $3 for a basket of chips and salsa.  That already through me off... So they bring out our food....really really really quick.  Like almost too quick.  Like quick to the point where all they did was warm up the food that was already made back there. Anyways, my enchiladas where not very good...and to my surprise, my plate came with just enchiladas.  I guess it's my fault for not fully reading the description.  But I figured $8 for enchiladas would have at least come with some rice or beans.  Noooope!  I just paid $8 for two cheese enchiladas.  And not even really good ones.   Needless to say, I left there very disappointed.  Wont' be going back there again.

YUUKK!!!  That pretty much describes this place.  We went there on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  Only 1 person in line in front of us.  I ordered the 2 meat combo, rib tips and hot links...sides of mac & cheese and potato salad.     ...it took about 40 mins to get my food.  But I told myself if it was good...then it's worth the wait.  But by God it wasn't good at all.  The mac & cheese had no flavor at all...i mean none.  The potato salad was very flavorless as well.  The rib tips would have been good if they weren't covered in 5 gallons of bbq sauce, nasty bbq sauce at that.  Their sauce is like a sweet and sour sauce...was not good at all.  The hot links were mixed in with the rib tips and covered in the same sauce.  So couldn't tell if they were any good, cause there was so much of that damn sauce.  The funny part was that the couple that ordered right after me, got their food and took it right back to the counter and straight out said that the food was just disgusting.  I wish I would have done the same instead of spending $15+ on nasty bbq.  In short.  I will not be going back here.

There's some good and some bad with this place.  Let's start off with the good.  Great food!  Great price!  Had my first outting to Pan Asia and was really digging the decor of the place.  Huge tv's over the bar... plenty of seating.  Lunch menu was good, ordered a "C".  Which pretty much was a spicy tuna roll, spicy california roll, and spicey salmon roll.  Lunch also came with salad and soup for just $9.  Also tried the crab-puffs...which to my surprise, had more crab then cream cheese.  They also have draft beers and bottle beers, though don't know about their draft beer cause it was being working on when we got there so I stuck with water. But overall the food was very good especially for that price.    Now let's talk about the bad.  For me the bad was the service.  Our server didn't seem like she wanted to be there at all.  Kind of like blah.  She wasn't mean, but she was kind of a drag.  She was also slow, the people around us called the manager cause they had been sitting there and our server never went over to them to get their order.  She needs to cheer up or maybe get a job where she can be all blah.  Maybe it was just a bad day for her.  Either way I'll continue to frequent Pan Asia and just make sure I sit in another servers section.

Yes...this is a chain restaurant...but none the less... this pizza is pretty good.  The red brick oven concept has been done before and much better, but it is usually much more expensive.  Red Brick is decently priced chain that serves good pizza.  Another cool plus, is when dining in, every booth has it's only TV so you could watch an episode of "Friends" while you eat...like we did.

Slow service. Slow service. Slow service. Slow service.   Been there 2.5 times.    First time.  Slow service.  Waited 15 mins for a bartender to ask us if we wanted anything... then another 15 mins after we order to actually get the beer.  After 1 beer were were done and wanted to leave. Took another 15 mins to get the tab after we asked for it.  We made sure to pay cash as we didnt want to wait another 15 mins for the bartender to run a card.  2nd time.  Walked in.  Sat at a table.  Waited 20 mins.  No server.  Left.  3rd time.  Walked in.  Sat at far end of bar next to server station.  Waited 15 mins for bartender to make it down to that side of the bar.  While sitting there got to hear the servers complain about how slow the bartender is and that they too have been waiting or over 10 mins for the beers they ordered. So I felt better as it wasn't just the patrons the bartenders ignore.  Once we finally did get service at the bar we had a smooth time.    Don't know if I'll go back.  Maybe if i'm already on mill and theres nothing else to do...then maybe...maybe I'll go back and try it again.     Just really bummed.  Wanted this place to rock.  Love a good beer.
