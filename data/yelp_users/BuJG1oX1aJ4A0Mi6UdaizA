Best Mexican place ever. Only knock is the wait can be awhile so order in advance! I usually get a few tacos and a pork burrito. Their hot sauce is crazy hot but so worth it and tasty.

I've been to a few nice steak houses and so far, Ruth's Chris has been my favorite. Excellent steaks, wine, and choices of bourbon. Every time I go somewhere else, they are compared to this place. Awesome. Definitely let them know in advance if you are there for a special occasion and they will take care of you.

My car was caked with dirt and for only 12.00, the auto wash did a pretty good job. The only bad thing was there was a weird purple gloss/shine on my car for about 24 hours but thankfully it went away. You should come here for a quick wash.

Pros:  They had our reservation and we were seated right away.  Constant attention by multiple waitresses.  The Lobster Bisque with added sherry actually had too much sherry. They replaced it right away.  The Creme Brulee trio, Roasted Corn side, and French Onion soup were great.  Cons: Atmosphere. People in tank tops and sandals and the football stuff everywhere. Sub par food. I had the lamb porterhouse which was just ok. For $41, ouch. The Lobster Bisque was terrible. The gf got the cowboy ribeye which was good but overcooked a bit.   Everything that we had was nothing special or below standard and for the price, was a really big let down. The staff/customer service were exceptional.

I went at 6pm on a Tuesday night and the service was great. We got garlic bread which was awesome and then bbq chicken pizza which again was awesome! The drinks kept coming and the waitress got a good tip. I will be back again.

Great beer and above average food. I went on a jam packed day and the owner was very helpful in taking care of us. He made sure we got our beers and held a spot for us on the waiting list. After ten minutes or so, we were able to get a spot at the bar. The gf went to find him and let him know we were taken care of and he remembered her name. Again, this was during a very crazy time (Candy Stout) so it was nice. The prices were reasonable and we had The Jess for the pizza. If I lived closer, this would be my go to spot.
