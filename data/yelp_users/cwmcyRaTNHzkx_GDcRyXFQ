It's good. The servings are small though. Don't plan on sharing. Very small restaurant with outdoor dining for the cooler months. Definitely a place to take visiting family as it has a nice atmosphere and is now a Phoenix icon.

Came here on a Saturday evening. I got the meal Guy Fieri tried and the girlfriend got pasta mit vodka. We both enjoyed our meals. This place has a really fun atmosphere and you feel like you are in Germany while dining. Will be back and recommend it to others.

Another Sam Fox restaurant. Food is decent but the location is better. Cool vibe. Good for get togethers. Worth coming to if in the area.

The best salmon I have ever had! The servers somehow kept the refills coming and the place was very busy. This place is a must. Fun atmosphere and great food!

This is my go-to place for Panang. Employees are always very friendly and dinner portions are large. Definitely enough to split. Quality Thai restaurant that never disappoints.

Phenomenal frozen yogurt! Best tasting and most creative flavors I have ever had. I am sad that they got rid of buy one get one free Thursdays. Now it's buy one get one half off on Thursdays. When I asked the employee why this was she said it was because the owner was going to use the extra money to invest it into the community... How bout you invest that money back into my wallet and give it for free again. Owner is really nice and the yogurt is so good I could never give this place anything less than 5 stars.

A good place to eat if you're downtown for whatever reason. Nice enough to bring clients to. Good sized portions and thoughtfully crafted menu. Appetizers are a plus such as the pretzels.

I feel bad giving this low of a review but I have to. The pizza was not tasty and was almost a waste of time and money. How do you mess up pizza? IDK. The worst part was not the pizza but the Eegee's slushies. Tried two flavors and had to give one back because it was that bad. I hope they can add some more flavor to the pizza and get rid of those slushies.

Wow! I crave this place. The ice cream tastes homemade and the atmosphere is unbeatable. This is what the central Phoenix culinary scene is all about. Great place to bring friends, family, and especially people from out of town. Employees are always very nice and seem to actually want you to try the flavors. Better than Coldstone if you are in the area.

Very nice place with a cool feel. Food is pricey but it is made to perfection and tastes great. Got the duck which was more "gamey" than my liking but still good. Just don't bring it home because it will make your whole car and house stink. Restaurant is very loud and it is hard to hear the person in front of you because of the tile floors and window walls. Worth coming to tho. Will be back.

Kind of a cool hidden place. Not hard to get to but "hidden" because who takes Central Ave south of McDowell Rd? The pizza was quality but I was very disappointed in the mac and cheese. I got the parmesan with jalape√±o. It came out warm, not hot, and had a weird texture. Seating is a little awkward with the huge arm chairs. Made it hard to sit up right to eat. Might come back one day.

Joe's has the best Italian Ice I've ever had! I used to go to Rita's but no more. The peanut butter cup and cookies n cream Italian ice flavors are my favorite. Staff is always super friendly and they always come to you to give samples. Make sure you get the joelatti.

Was expecting a so-so bar and grill by a golf course. Was pleasantly surprised that this place is really good! Had the fish and chips. I was worried that the batter would over power the fish, but the fish was generously portioned in each piece. I had 6 pieces of fish (all you can eat Friday) and I did not get sick from too much fried goodness. Service was on point as well . Will be back.

If you like good, healthy food this is the place! I could not believe that I fell in love with oatmeal after my first  visit to Iss'. I highly recommend the oatmeal pancakes and the vegan burgers. Owners Melissa and Sam are always so nice to me throughout my visits. They truly care about this place and the food they make. Must try!

My girlfriend and I went to Sammiches for the first time yesterday. The owner Jacob and his wife Cathy were both working so we got the full experience. The sandwiches were phenomenal and Jacob and his wife are basically the coolest couple around. The sandwiches are made with such care as Jacob is so passionate about what he does. If you've seen the movie Chef the owner, Jacob, will remind you of Carl (Jon Favreau). Definitely a sandwich shop worth visiting.

Can you say overrated? Why people eat here will always puzzle me. I would rather go to Denny's because at least their food comes out warm and the hash browns have some flavor. Tried this place twice now and will not return.

Twisted Cultures just opened within the last month and so I decided to give it a try. The store was very clean and the staff gave me a friendly greeting upon entering. I have tried a lot of good frozen yogurt flavors in the past so I was expecting it to just be okay. I was surprised at how delicious their flavors were! They only had 8 flavors out but they were all top-notch! Their toppings were cut how I want them, into BIG pieces. The Reese's P-Nut Cups were cut in half . They also have full sized Twix, Kit-Kats, and Cookies 'N Cream bars. Great selection. I also loved how they have a drinking fountain in the store because froyo tends to make me thirsty and I didn't need to buy a bottle of water. Great music inside, great feel, I will be back!

Came here for my birthday. They were very accommodating for our large group and made the reservation process easy. In a really cool old home converted into a restaurant. Very nice atmosphere. The pizza is phenomenal.

Very disappointed. The menu looked great and the restaurant looks nice, but the food is just awful. Ordered shrimp skewers and spicy orange chicken. The shrimp was probably the worst shrimp I have ever had. The orange chicken comes with the sauce on the side. Sauce was decent but the chicken, which was breaded and fried, was awful. Really chewy and had a strange texture.   I know this restaurant was converted from an old McDonald's and sadly I wished I had gone across the street to McDonald's instead.

Definitely not worth it! After going to snooze I was disappointed in the food. I ordered the Danish Blueberry pancakes and they were cold when served and bland. I maybe ate half of the plate and didn't even want to take the rest home. I also ordered a side of hash browns and two scrambled eggs. The hash browns had no flavor and were too soft for my liking. The eggs weren't even good. I honestly wish we had gone to IHOP instead and that is saying something.

Such a fun place to go! We were treated like royalty from start to finish. Go with a date or some friends and try and solve a challenging mystery to escape the room. Very professional and very clever!

A cool place! Pizza is a very thick, pan pizza that isn't too greasy. Crust is nice and crispy. Service is slow and the employees act kind of snobby that they are busy. Like when you come in and they tell you the wait time it's as if they want you to leave... Other than that it's worth coming to.

Avoid this place! I ordered a personal pesto pizza with very little chicken, tomatoes, spinach, onions, and olives and my total was $20! Ridiculous. No one that was making the pizza mentioned that each topping was extra. I started off with a $7.99 pizza! How in the world did those little toppings add $12.00! Workers are all incompetent. I was shocked when I received my total. I told the cashier that ALL the other make your own pizza places don't charge extra for toppings. The cashier's response was uhhhhh I just moved here from out of state. He looked like a deer in the headlights. I told him I'm never coming back. No offer to keep a first timer happy or even get a manager after it was obvious that this was a deal breaker for me.  To be fair the pizza was good and the decor is very well done inside. Go to MOD or Pieology instead.

Trendy restaurant with a very modern feel inside. Got the salmon and it was good but not anything to yell about. Had some creative dishes on the menu and intrigued me enough to want to come back.

Wow! Ate here for the first time today. They officially open the 11th of February. Everything on the menu sounds delicious and, from what we ordered, tastes delicious. It is a more upscale American bistro with some clever flavor twists inspired by the Southwest. I had the grilled salmon which was amazing! We also ordered crab cakes and spinach artichoke as appetizers. The crab cakes were perfect and came with such a good sauce. The spinach artichoke was probably the best artichoke dip I have ever had! For dessert our favorite was the carrot cake. This place is so well decorated inside and the decor is complimented by the very classy staff who treated us very well. This place is a must!

Shake shack is good but a little pricey for a small burger. In N Out I still think is better and cheaper. However, this place is worth trying. The shakes and the fries are better than the actual burgers.

This place is a lot of fun! A lot to learn during your first visit as their is a small learning curve. Hostesses up front had a hard time explaining everything in a clear matter. However, once you get the hang of it, it is a lot of fun! Make sure to pay extra for the "training scenarios." We did not and we watched others' screens all night wishing we had. You cannot decide later to add the training videos unless you purchase more time. Service was very attentive except for when we ran out of mags a couple of times and had to wait for more to be given to us. Did not try the food. Great place for groups.
