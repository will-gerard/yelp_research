Horrible Customer Service!  No smiles, no personality, they called me "You" the entire time I was there.  Very Bad

Not exactly the friendliest people.   I was nice to them, but it wasn't reciprocated.   They kicked me out after a beer and a margarita because I wasn't hungry.  And the bartender said "Well, You might get drunk"    Really?   This is a bar, Right??    C'Mon MAN.  Never gave me the WiFi password either.

Rude little Hispanic girl wouldn't give me her name... She was talking down to her customers, and didn't offer anyone napkins or seasoning.  No Manners at All.   Train Your Employees to Be Respectful of the People who are keeping them employed.
