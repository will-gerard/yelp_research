I took my wife to The Melting Pot earlier this evening for our anniversary dinner. Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted by the hostess and the manager, and even seated before our reservation time. Our server came out quickly, with a friendly, pleasant demeanor and a fun, quirky attitude. She was fast, courteous, informative and fun. She helped us through our first visit in detail and helped make our anniversary dinner an amazing experience. Our drink never ran empty, we never waited long for the follow-up course and no questions went unanswered. Her recommendations were solid and we had a blast. Our visit was well worth every penny! We will definitely be returning in the future.

Good God, I love this place! The burgers are delicious here! The staff are friendly, the restaurant is always clean and the food is ready very quickly. I always order the Hangover burger with the fried egg on it. So good. I highly recommend Fuddruckers as a go-to burger joint.

Not too sure what's going on with OTB these days. I used to order and receive hearty, platefuls of delicious Mexican food, but now, it seems that those days are gone. OTB was pretty bare when I went in with my mother today, so service shouldn't have been an issue, but it was. She ordered a chicken fajitas plate which had an insanely small amount of food on it, especially considering what we were paying. I ordered the Dos XX fish tavos which were plentiful, but different in taste compared to what they used to be, and not in a pleasant way. The refried beans on my plate were runny and the black beans that my mother ordered magically turned into refried beans by the time they hit our table. We were inside of OTB for about an hour and we were offered a refill on our iced teas ONCE. Our cups sat empty for quite some time. The one time someone did refill our drinks, it wasn't even our server. I don't think I'll be venturing back to OTB any time soon. Whatever you guys have changed... change it back.

Well, our 4 month old GSD and our 1.5 yr old pit got out of our gare somehow yesterday morning, the day after Christmas. Still unsure how they escaped. Unfortunately, our pup was ultimately struck by an oncoming vehicle on a main road. She was is bad shape and in need of serious care. We rushed her to 1st Pet and they took her in immediately. After about 2 hours, Dr. Lindgren informed us that our pup had major constusions/lacerations on her lungs and a broken arm. She was in critical condition. While I applaud their haste, I very much disliked the lack of emotion and the complete disregard Lindgren had for our situation. She seemd to be the type of vet who there for the paycheck and nothing further. She did take care of our dog thou, so it was fairly confusing. We arrived at 3pm and at 9pm, we left knowing only that our dear pup was on the dlfence and was either going to be coming home or going to rest externally. Of course, it was an emotional night for my wife and I. Thankfully, our daughter was at an overnighter and wasn't privy to the situation. At 6am this morning, my phinew rings and the ID states that it's 1st Pet. My heart sank and I expected the worst immediately. It was a personal call from Dr. Meredith. She was now caring dor our pup and had done a phenomenal job. Dr. Meredith informed me that our little pup was doing great and would be ready to come home at 9am. Obviously, we were elated and so, so, so happy to be bringing our fur baby home. We can't thank 1st Pet enough for their immediately, consistent care.

Let's start with the con... pricing. Definitely a bit higher than Lowe's on most products. However, the customer service makes up for it here. I've yet to have a poor experience at this location. Every staff member is helpful, friendly, polite and knowledgeable. I go to this HD location not only because it's close, but because I'm comfortable there.

Hands down, the worst automotive service I've ever had. I typically do oil changes changes at home in the family vehicles, but have recently suffered a major back injury. I was forced to find somewhere to take both my wife's sedan and my truck. We found a Groupon coupon online and my wife jumped on the savings. Well, the Groupon was for a $20 oil change + free tire rotation. After waiting two hours, my truck was done, only they didn't rotate my tires and when I brought it to their attention, the manager told me that I'd have to bring my truck back in at another time to have the tires rotated. I wish this were only a joke. Had my wife's car not already been in the stall, we'd have left then and there. Secondly, guess who forgot to put the oil cap back on after finishing the change? Yes! The Fletcher's certified technician. I suppose on a lighter note, they did rotate her tires. Do yourself a favor and check out other local shops. The big box shops are going downhill faster than a shoved Rosie O'Donnell. (Please excuse any typos. This was typed on a phone.)

I went to the Dolphin car wash for the first time about a week ago. I spent $12 and it was worth the money, twice over. First, they started with a hand rinse and spray, then I went through the auto-wash, which did a great job, and lastly, I ended up in a zone where two gentlemen hand dried my wife's car and hand cleaned the windshield. The car was beautiful. I highly recommend this place for an affordable, worthy car wash.

Not the cleanest place on Earth, but not the dirtiest either. The staff, from my experience, are ignorant, unfriendly, inattentive, unconcerned and sincerely useless at times. They will walk right through you if you let them. It's Walmart.

Store #020899 in Apache Junction. What a joke. I've lived in AJ for about 13 years now, and I've gone to this location plenty of times. Not one of these visits has ever resulted in a pleasant experience for me, but I like the food. However, that's to be expected when you purchase food from a fast food franchise joint that hires teens with multiple children and mid-20's adult "Juggalos" who still live with their parents and have a drop-out, 10th grade education. Tonight, 11/28/2014 resulted in a much more irritating visit than other visits. I ordered a plentiful amount, as my family was fairly hungry this evening after putting up Christmas lights. So, I get to Taco Bell, order, pay and leave, unsuspecting of a fouled order. I get home and behold... a missing taco and my daughter's beloved Cheesy Potato burrito, gone. Well, I drive back, inform the girl at the drive through about the mishap and am told it will be immediately corrected. Cool. Whatever. I kust wanna go home. Well, I get the burrito and taco and head home. Guess what! Wrong effing burrito! Back I went to finally get the correct food. By the time I got home, MY tacos were soggy, my tostada was soggy and everything else was cold. Meal... ruined. Don't go to this location unless you hate yourself.

Meh. The food was ok, and the service was less than satisfactory. I love Village Inn deals, but their service is NEVER great. We have 3 locations nearby (Apache Junction, Signal Butte and Power & Main) and have gone to each at least a dozen times in the last 13 years. We have never been impressed by the quality of service from the wait staff. The VIB breakfast is a good deal though, so we've gone back. However, this last trip might have changed that for me. I ordered biscuits and gravy and the biscuits were not made how they used to be. Pretty crumby, really. My wifes cr√©pe was all soggy amd weird, too. To top it off, it was like pulling teeth, trying to get an iced tea refill. Not impressed by the AJ location at all this trip. Still love the hashbrowns though!

Our visit at this Arby's was a joke! The couple of clowns working around 8:00pm on 06/08/14, were as slow as snails and had the customer service skills of a piece of plywood. Seemed that there was one cook, one blonde girl cleaning the dining area, and a shift manager, named Jasmine. The shift manager continually stated "I'll be right with you" again and again. At first, it was understandable, due to drive through orders, but then she just stopped and started talking to the blonde girl, giggling. When she finally got to us at the register, she was rude and unprofessional, sporting a look like we were inconveniencing her. After we gave her our order, she didn't bother to recite it back, but instead, gave me the total, swiped my card and slammed down the receipt with a pen and said, "I need you to sign this." $15/hr, eh? The food was great, but the service was insanely terrible and we will never go back.

Ninja. A true Heaven on Earth! All you can eat sushi for $22? Yes, please! My wife and I dine at Ninja about once a month. The staff are incredibly friendly, the dining area is always clean, the sushi is absolutely delicious and the pricing is awesome for all you can eat. I often order the Hipster roll, the Boston roll and the Gringo roll. Phenomenal food. I highly recommend Ninja for the sushi whore in you. There are tons of rolls to choose from and not a one is disappointing. Get ya some!

I have been using EVT for all of my wheel and tire needs for the last three years and I have never been disappointed. They are fast, friendly and above all, ethical. The owner is always on site and always communicates with customers on a regular basis. The staff are knowledgeable, courteous and quick. I am a car guy myself, so I know what to look for in shops and EVT has all the signs of a grade A shop. I recommend them to everyone and I recommend them to you!

Such a beautiful hike, especially if you're going all the way through to Flat Iron. Somewhere around 5 miles, I believe. I've been through here with my family, and ob solo journeys. It's incredible. Planning on going back in a couple of weeks. Highly recommended.

I love this place. My wife introduced me to Sauce a couple of months ago and we go to lunch together here every now and then. I tupically order the chicken, broccoli pasta with cheese sauce and an artichoke and mushroom bruchetta. I love the food and the atmosphere is calm and relaxing as well. The staff os super friendly and the guy who usually takes our order at the front is awesome. Today, he brougjt our plates out and evem though it's self-serve, he asked if he could refill my glass of iced tea. I still don't know what's better, the food or the customer service. No matter... I highly recommend Sauce for inexpensive, delicious Italian eats and fast, courteous and friendly service.

My family and I are more than happy with Neighborhood Vision Center. The staff is incredibly helpful, from insurance questions to frame selection and appointment scheduling. Keith, the tech, was super friendly and very professional. Dr. Kneip genuinely cares for his patients and their vision. He checked and rechecked some stuff with my daughter's eyes to be absolutely sure that she was getting what she needed. We've never received such amazing service or doctor to patient care. I can't say enough good about everyone there at Neighborhood.

A true customer service and professionalism FAIL. Let's start with the super obnoxious, loud-as-hell, ultra annoying woman in the deli-department. Good Lord, if she would just shut up and do her job, I wouldn't have to stand in line as long. I don't think she understands that she has a job to do, and it isn't to make buddy-buddy with every customer she encounters. Moving to the meat department, which is chalk-full of some of the most unfriendly, antisocial folks I've encountered in a grocery store, there you'll find little help and lesser smiles. Skipping all of the knit-picki g and getting to checking out; it's hit or miss. I've had friendly, competent clerks and I've had the displeasure of encountering their opposites. The store prices are too high, in general as well. I now typically shop Walmart instead.

I love Bass Pro! I'm a hunter, fisherman, camper, hiker, etc. Bass Pro Shop has it all, and typically, it's all at a decent price. Not only do they provide awesome products and killer displays, but they also provide really cool activities for the kids throughout the week! Definitely worth checking out.

Ahhh, yeeeaaaaah. My favorite restaurant, hands down. I'm a country boy, born and raised, so finding good ol' down home cooking like this at a restaurant was a giant blessing! My God, it's so good. I usually order the Country Fried Steak, green beans, mashed potatoes and gravy, and fried okra... all with two delicious biscuits on the side. They give me all of the for under $11!!! I never leave unsatisfied. To tope off the great food, the store is incredible. I just picked up the Gaithers gospel collection, some stocking stuffers for Christmas and a bunch of old fashioned candy. CB does good for the soul.

I always get great service here. I'm usually rolling through with my wife and daughter for a burger and iced tea. The Screamin' Nacho Burger is amazing! Especially after a delicious basket of fried pickles. We haven't had a bad experience yet, wmand it's definitely become a regular spot for us. We have tried other BWW locatuons, but, eh... we'll stick to this one.

Veterans Oasis in Chandler is absolutely gorgeous. I come here often with my family to fish in the beautiful ponds and lakes. Aside from the gorgeous waters, the park offers clean, green landscaping blended with the desert view that is perfect for biking, walking, jogging and more. Even picnics are perfect here.

I've never experienced so many fast food issues in one place, in such a short period of time. About 2 months ago, my wife and I went through the drive through and placed an order. When we got home, we realized that what we received was substantially different than what we had ordered. No big deal, I drove back. It happens sometimes. Well, a couple of weeks later, it happened again, but this time, I'm certain that it was because the manager decided he'd rather BS with the employees than work, as they were chatting all around the counter. So, I called the 1-800 number and left a detailed message. The franchise OWNER called me directly and apologized and even gave us an unlimited and free meal to apologize. Of course, we spent about $15. We aren't jerks. Well, come this week, we go through the drive through again and guess who's palling around at the counter, talking and laughing again? The manager. Guess who got there order wrong again? Us. We are not going back to that location, ever.

This location is borderline mediocre on its best day. While the staff are overall a friendly bunch, they aren't the most knowledgeable crew. I'm there frequently,  to purchase our dogs their food. I've had a woman once try to convince me that the Petsmart brand, Simply Nourish, was a better food than Blue Buffalo. She gave me SO MUCH flase information. I let her continue her speech for a solid three minutes before finally stopping her and calling her on it. I couldn't believe what just happened. The woman became embarrassed and did everything she could to back pedal.  This isn't the only time that I've run into flat out incorrect information. I've also had employees just know nothing about a product, but some will be honest and just admit it at least. Petsmart is ok to shop if you know what you're getting, but don't bother going in if you need product information. You're better off using Google.

I went into Casual Male today for the first time. I was looking for some nice slacks and a shirt for a big interview. I was extremely impressed that they had EVERYTHING in my sizes, but I was also a little heartbroken that everything costs an arm and a leg. I walked out with a pair of GS pants for close to $70 today. The clothing is quality and the staff are super awesome, but I have a hard time paying $60 for a shirt that I feel should be $30 - $35. I will return, however. Casual Male might become by go-to "big guy" spot.

I've used Brakes Plus on Signal Butte & Southern twice now. The first time around, I took my Crown Victoria in for an alignment. The price was great and the quality of the work was phenomenal. They let me know immediately that I had a bad pitman/idler arm. So, I was able to run to the parts store and pick up what I needed, get home and get my baby fixed. They also informed me that after I had fixed the issues, they would realign my car again within 90 days, for FREE! Of course, I took my wife's car in for an alignment when it needed it last week. Again, outstanding prices and quality service. Mike and Joe are always great to work with.

Best Chinese food in the valley! They have the best food, the biggest selection and the greatest service. I don't think I have ever had to ask for a drink refill in all my times at their establishment. My family and I have a monthly tradition of visiting ESB and without regret! They are friendly, courteous and on point. We always leave a great tip, and for a reason.

It's been years since my band and I recorded here, but I couldn't forget the experience if I tried. Aside from the crude child rape joke that made me want to knock the hell out of our producer, the work in general was very lazy. I wouldn't record at Full Well if the time was free.

So freakin' delicious! So many mornings I sneak over for an Eriks Special burrito. The name scares the hell out of me, but it's a really good, giant burrito, full of deliciousness. For later in the day food, I love their rolled taco meals, the beef burritos and their chicken tacos. Eriks beats Fili's like a red headed step child with bad grades! I thought about moving to Gilbert once, but then Erikberto's opened up shop. Try it!

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with them last week. I bought a retired police cruiser awhile back and intend to turn it into a Mad Max style cruiser. Well, it needed some sound. I went over to A-1 and told them I wanted to get rid of the mufflers and sleeve the exhaust to straight pipes. In our neck of the woods, that's usually a $150 job for a dual exhaust ride. They charged me $80 and they did it in about 45 minutes! I showed up, discussed what I wanted, they took my keys, and 45 minutes in, I was rumbling down the road in my desert doom rider! Awesome service and excellent prices!

Well, it started out great, butwent to the crapper as soon as I had an injury. February 2014, my wife and I purchased black card memberships and it was wonderful. We loved the equipment, the staff, the 24/7 entrance, all of it! We used the amenities regular ad well. Again, it was great. Well, around July 2014, I staryed developing back pain and ultimately found that I have degenerative disc disease in my spine, as well as a few other back related issues. I was told to stop hotting the gym IMMEDIATELY. Of course, I continued paying my membership in hopes that I could return. Unfortunately, I could not. I called and asked if there was anything I could do to pull my black card memberships down to standard, since I wouldn't be using them at all. Thought $20/month for two unused memberships would be a lesser blow than $40/month. I should've known that customer service only goes so far. I spoke with the manager and got the whole, "I'll look into it and call you back" bit. Of course, no call back. Called later that week. Same gig. I called corporate. Same dog and pony show. My medical bills were and sti are piling up, so every dollar counts. I still can't believe that they refused to assist in ANY way, shape or form. If I recover enough to get back to the gym, I will be taki g my business elsewhere, and that sucks, because I enjoyed PF quite a bit. Long story short, contracts are contracts and customer care is a thing of the past.

I can only refer to O'Reilly as the Autozone Slayer. The staff in O'Reilly stores don't have the tendency to walk around like zombies and stare at customers with blank expressions. They are actually quite helpful! I spend my money at O'Reilly when I need parts. i recommend them for your DIY mechanic needs.

Went to Boulder's for the first time last night with my wife and some friends. As soon as we entered, we noticed a pretty laid back environment and atmosphere. We ordered our drinks and they came out promptly. I loved the variety of beers! Shortly after, we ordered a few appetizers, including fried pickled, fried cheese curds and buffalo wings. The appetizers were amazing. I ended up ordering the grilled mahi-mahi tacos, which were fairly mediocre, but they came out fast and they were sizable. Our server was great as well. I wish I could have gotten her name so that I could her a shout-out. She kept our glasses filled and our orders hot. We will definitely be going back again.
