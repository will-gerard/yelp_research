My 100th review! Had to make it special and Dino's sure is that. Went there for my 30th Birthday with a group of about 12 and had the time of my life.  Looks smaller than it is inside. Cheap drinks. Locals who don't act like jerks to the tourists wandering in. And karaoke to boot. If you're looking for something less expensive but more memorable than the $100 cover clubs on the strip, this is your place. Check the attitude and the Jersey Shore clothing at the door and have yourself a grand fucking time!

As an Oakland Athletics fan, it is insanely frustration to see a such a beautiful stadium for a team that has only been in the league since 1998 and with only 1 World Series tittle to its name. Still, inside and out, it is a great park for baseball and in an amazing location right off the freeway and with a train stop in front of it. Looking forward to coming back this season for a live game.

I have a natural, well I guess unnatural as I am no sort of Island Nationality, to frequent authentic Tiki Bars, but this one takes the cake. In fact, of the dozen or so I have sought out across the country, there was only one other even close to it.   Started of my 30th birthday there with a group of 9, staff was polite and patient even though it was already pretty crowded there. They make one hell of a zombie too! Some places over power for the reaction of the drink, but they have a killer, creeper mind you, recipe. The way it should be. Unless you have a stomach made of stainless steel, 2 drinks authentic drinks is the max, sugar will be the end for you.  Well worth the drive away from the glitz and glam of the strip but please don't think you'll be able to go in and be "seen" or expect vip bottle table service...yo. Not that kind of place, and we like it that way.

While this place is simply gorgeous, it is almost too big to believe it is a Spring Training facility. True, it is shared by two teams and thousands of Dodger fans flock her every year since moving over from Florida, it has more of the AAA feel to it. The screen is better than some of the older Major League stadiums in fact.   If you're not staying in Glendale, the trip out there can be a bit brutal. A cab ride from Phoenix will cost you a pretty penny and they sure don't stop the meters when you're stuck in traffic both getting into and out of the stadium. However, once inside, you will find a newer stadium that is truly able to service the needs of a much larger crowd than at any of the other Spring facilities.

Pure and utter dog poop.   Asked for an "Anaheim Scramble" with some orange juice. The cashier told me they didn't have juice. I asked if they were out. She replied no, and that she even thought it was weird they didn't carry any juice being a breakfast place.   My scramble comes out and the waitress who brings it to me looks at it oddly before serving it to me. I ask her why she looked at it that way. she said no reason. I insisted there would be some reason to eye my eggs like that. She showed me the eggs were under cooked and runny and returned it to the kitchen.  What she brought back was some sort of Frankenstein's monster of a scramble with stale toast.  See picture for further reference.
