Went to AMC this past week and had a mindblowing experience. I had ordered 2 margaritas for my grandparents that were in town visiting. The server brought our drinks everything seemed fine until she came back and interrupted not only us but the people around us. She wanted to take my 68 year old grandmas margarita, because she didn't have her ID on her. We asked for a manager to make an exception given her age, which was denied. She was very rude throughout the process and took the drink and walked away. At the end of the movie we waited an extra 10 minutes to get our check back. She really embarrassed my grandma as there was a lot of attention on us. I will never go back to AMC dine in again as it was not a pleasant experience.

Who doesn't love coffee rush?! I'm obsessed with the rush frosts. Staff, and owners are also very kind.
