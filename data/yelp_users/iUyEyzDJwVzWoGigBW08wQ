Love this HEALTHY breakfast/lunch spot at the entrance of the Canyon Ranch Spa/Workout facility. I always get their protein smoothie post workout (love the Power Up Smoothie and the Build Your Own Smoothie when I need a custom creation), and sometimes one of their freshly squeezed juices (I recommend the Inflamation Fighter). Good for you, and delicious. I have only tried the Chorizo Breakfast Wrap once, but it was really flavorful and hit the spot - made with organic egg, beef chorizo, cheddar cheese and house-made salsa for $14 served with some fresh fruit on the side.  Everyone I have ever encountered has been very friendly, patient and helpful.   The one downside is that they close at 2:00pm, so if you have a lunch workout, you might not make it before they close.  Don't miss this HEALTHY option in Vegas, Baby!

Wonderful food, wine list and service!   I had to book a last-minute (2 days prior) dinner for 40, and Fleur de Lys was a stellar choice. The staff worked quickly to accommodate the group, and put together a fabulous meal including: an individual appetizer assortment plate served with a creative flair on the plate: Seared Foie Gras Terrine, Ahi Tuna Tar-tare with Ginger Ponzu, Roasted Organic Beets with Goat Cheese; a main course, choice of Pan Seared Diver Scallops, Slow Braised Beef Short Ribs, or Seared Duck Breast & Duck Con-fit; and a dessert - chocolate "feast" or a fruit "minestrone" with basil ice cream. It was all excellently prepared and plated. I had the scallops as the main course, and they were perfectly done and served with a piece of zucchini and crab tempura.   The service was outstanding - from start to finish. The wine list is extensive and the staff helpful with choices. While a very romantic spot for a couple, our group off 40 had a fabulous time and enjoyed the food, wine, staff and experience.  A bit pricy, but its Vegas - no more $10 buffets! And, you get what you pay for...Fleur de Lys is worth every penny.

I hosted a large work event on the patio with heavy appetizers and drinks for about 40 people. Our main server, Daniel, as an absolute ROCK STAR - he took care of our whole group swiftly with a smile. Daniel has the ability to take drink and food orders for about 20 people at a time, all in his head, without missing a thing. I cannot say enough good about Daniel - ask for him, he will take care of you.  Otherwise, the food was really good - bacon wrapped dates, flatbreads, ravioli served family style, beet salad and hummus. They also have interesting cocktails, sangria and a great wine/beer selection.   We will be back for future events - thank you!

We had a reservation for 4, and were greeted by the hostess with genuine kindness and the we were seated promptly. The space is large, yet intimate at the same time. A fun spot to be.  The food: after walking past two different tables feasting on the fried calamari, we joined the crusade and indulged. Light And crispy batter, and served with a delicious marinara sauce. For dinner, my colleagues had the seafood linguine (not a bite left on his plate, the Bolognese (again, cleaned plate), and the seared yellowtail (which was delish!). I was in a weird combo mood and had the tuna stack appie and a baked potato (I warned you it was weird!). Both tasty. Also, they bring some killer garlic bread, also served with marinara, to the table - some of the best I have ever had! Finally, we shared a comp dessert, fried Oreos, compliments of a Yelp check in. Wow!  Our server, Ryan, was a rockstar in all categories. Funny, knowledgable and super friendly. Be sure to sit in his section. Also a shot out to all of his support team, refilling water glasses and delivering entrees.   -1 star for the noise factor, but we are in Vegas.   Try it!

Never stayed, but indulged with friends on their rooftop for cocktails and snacks. Great service, excellent mixed drinks, and a lovely view of the pool. A New York way to relax with an AZ sunset.

We had great service (4 in our party), but the food was terrible - some of the worst. It all started with a dozen raw oysters that had a "smelly fish" odor and tasted worse then they smelled. Each of us went for the $67 Waygu Rib Eye - and the quality of the meat was worse than an Outback sirloin. We were shocked. Also, the Roasted Mushrooms were so over salted they were inedible. The Creamed Corn and the Crispy Fingerling Potatoes were "meh" at best.   The only redeaming thing about this meal at Modern Steak was our server, Josh.   AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
