A-ma-zing!!!! Not only do they have my favorite beer (peach ale) on tap, BUT they have created a craft cocktail which incorporates the peach ale and my favorite drink, the Mojito! They call it a Sip'n'Slide, and it is a MUST order. Along with our delicious beverages, we enjoyed calamari and Bavarian pretzels. When offered cheese sauce to go with the pretzels, the answer was of course YES PLEASE! Omg. The cheese sauce was to die for. Dunking warm, soft, chewy pretzels into the molten Jack cheese and green chile sauce made me want to never eat anything else ever again. I finished the cheese sauce off with a spoon...it was THAT good. I'm dying to go back and order another Sip'n'Slide and pretzel appetizer!

Upon recommendation, we chose Dr. Wiekhorst for a house call to put our beloved Toro to sleep at our home after beginning to suffer from organ failure. When first calling in to the receptionist, she was extremely compassionate and took her time getting my information, as I was in tears and had a hard time getting my contact info across clearly. After setting an appointment for the following day, I had the immediate doubt of, "is it really time, could he hang on one more day?". The office staff understood my dilemma and told me they would follow up in the morning to see how we were doing, and to check if we still wanted the appointment or would like to postpone it. Having that option and not feeling obligated to anyone else's time table with my pet's last days was a luxury I am so thankful for. When the call came the next morning, I knew it was time, and confirmed for that afternoon. Dr. Wiekhorst let me know he was on his way, which allowed me to make sure my kids and other animals were prepared. This great man came into my home knowing how hard this was, and was so professional and compassionate towards our tears. With sedation and not even a flinch from my sweet old boy, Dr. Weikhorst eased my beloved Toro off to cross the rainbow bridge. After giving me a hug and his condolences, Dr. Weikhorst left our home just as touched as we were, and everyone could tell he truly cared for Toro in his final moments. Whoever says this vet practice doesn't treat their clients like family blows my mind. We will be switched all of our veterinary needs to Foothills Vet!!

I wish I could give a zero star review...If you are looking for a local, small town business with an owner who appreciates the town and cares for her customers, RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!! As a long time customer, 25+ years to be exact, my family lived for Friday nights spent at Encanto.  After the wonderful owner passed, his money hungry daughter took the reins and lost our business forever. The food, atmosphere, and events have ALL lost their luster. As a customer, I've only seen the prices skyrocket while the quality of the food drops and the portions shrink. Also, if ever thinking of having an event at the restaurant in downtown Cave Creek, STOP, and think again. My brother had a horrible experience with the "event planner" who didn't even show up the night of his wedding. A cash bar was present when the bride asked for it to be only alcohol she purchased, and afterwards, the owner took it upon herself to degrade the groom's family and take their concerns personally, and lash out, rather than deal with them professionally. It saddens me to have lost a wonderful place to eat, however, the Encanto I knew and loved left with the original owner.

Went back with a friend of mine (not my choice) from out of town who LOVED Encanto when she lived here. I tried convincing her to go elsewhere because the place is so awful now. Well, our drinks were horrible to start off with. A pi√±a colada that was riddled with ice chunks, no flavor, and half of the glass was filled with whipped cream. Ordering the pollo fundido, I got what I expected. A dry, flavorless chicken filling wrapped in a greasy tortilla. The fundido sauce WAS good, however it was cold, and just not worth the jacked up price they charge. Never. Ever. Again. Even if an out of town friend wants to go. I'll take my business down the road to Plaza Bonita instead.

This is our favorite spot in Cave Creek! The coffee is fabulous, and their breakfast is always on point. You have GOT to order the pancakes...a delicious granola crunch smothered with a berry compote, those bad boys don't even need syrup! We love sitting out on the patio on the high top tables with our kids watching the cars and bikes roll through Cave Creek while chatting with other patrons. The atmosphere is great, and the owners are awesome!

The customer service in the store is horrible. If you're looking to load your own pellets, load your own hay, and drive around the store twice to find the hay, this is the place for you. While there are several staff members that are fabulous, most of the young crew are too busy flirting with each other or customers to bother to help take out heavy bags of feed for other customers.   The feed prices are cheap, which is what has kept me coming back. I'm leaving after having an order refunded to my card after the girls at the front sold me Bermuda that they didn't even have in stock. When I got out to the alfalfa pile to load my own hay, it was moldy, and full of dust. If anything, I would say it's cow hay at best.    Today was the last straw. With a one-year-old in my arms in a three-year-old walking, I paid for my hay, went out to the truck only to find they did not have Bermuda and the alfalfa was horrible, and no one offered to bring my pellets out. I had to strap the kids into the truck, and go back and load my own pellets and drag them out to the truck.  Meanwhile, several workers could be seen in the back chatting away with each other. I will be heading back into Cave Creek to Black Mountain Feed where I might pay a dollar more, but I won't have to leave children unattended in the truck to load my own hay, nor go back into the store for a third time to get a refund after being charged for an item they don't even have in stock.
