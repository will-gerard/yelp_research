Went to Wild Thaiger two nights ago, I have been before, but my girlfriend had not. I love Thaiger so I wanted to share the tastiness. I figured I would write a review since I have not yet.  Wild Thaiger is in the heart of uptown Phoenix. Central and Thomas area. Cool little restaurant with a nice atmosphere inside.  Food is great and very fresh. I like that you can see the entire kitchen from most of the tables in the restaurant. They have nothing to hide. Prices are pretty standard at between 8.95-14.95 for dinner entrees.   Great food and wonderful service. Nice change from other Thai restaurants in Tempe, Chandler, Mesa, etc.

Very cozy restaurant with outside seating. On weekend nights, ton of energy. Awesome food. Pizza is thin and very generous with the quality toppings. Price is not too bad for the pizza size and taste you get.

This place is str8 bawlin y'all. Have you even mouthed a crunch wrap pressed down by the beautiful gentle hands of Madeline. I've had my share of late night nosh snacks but this flower of a human being comes into my life and touches deep into my loins. Madeline if you are reading this I want to be with you in more than just a drive thru (through?) type of way. This could work on more than just a 9-5 (or graveyard shift) level. Please call me back and let's toast some cinny twists. I'm sorry to open forum my love (lust) for you. Be mine.

My diet is 95% chicken and rice, so when I can't make it at home I go to rice bowl restaurants. The only problem with this is I am weirdo when it comes to hot food and styrofoam. When in contact with hot food it  leaches neurotoxins styrene and benzene. Very very bad so stop drinking coffee and eating food from styrofoam.   Anyway I asked them to put my hot chicken and rice into one of their ceramic bowls and although not understanding why, they happily complied. Thank you China Wok I will be back often just because of this.   Oh and my food was good :)

Terrible prices. Terrible customer service.   Almost $400 for a standard main drain snake. Almost $200 for any other drains.  All of my sinks, showers and toilets were backed up. I had them snake the main drain. Solved my problem. Less than two weeks later my two bathroom sinks are backing up again. I call them, they show up over 2 hours late and tell me it will be another $200 because its a separate drain. Why didn't they tell me this may be an issue the first time they were supposed to fix ALL of the drains. Called customer service and manager was supposed to call me an never did, so I called back the next day. Did not hear back until a day after that (my sinks are sitting there clogged the whole time and I can't use them) Finally I get a call from GREG. He tried to talk over me, was rude and gave me the run around to try and shut me up. I told him I am a new homeowner and have lived in my house for just over a year and they just lost a customer for life. He did not seem to care or want to address the problem.  Go with a small plumbing company they will charge you 1/4 of the price.   Also, instead of nasty Drain-O, go natural and pour dry banking soda down the problem sink, then vinegar and cover the hole, it will force the mixture down the pipe. 20-30 min after that pour a gallon of boiling water down the sink. Repeat this several times on big problem drains. Works like a freaking charm. Didn't believe it until I did it.

My girlfriend and I love Thai and have tried most of the restaurants around the valley. Thai Rama had been a place we had not been to based completely on Yelp reviews.  So one night in Tempe instead of going to the reliable Thai Basil, we decided we needed to finally try Thai Rama. Inside is nice, not many people inside. Quaint and homey inside with very kind and gentle waitresses.   I had read that this place was over priced and not very good. I'm not sure where that came from because your standard Thai dish was $9.95 for dinner with some prices on dishes being even a bit lower. You obviously have the more elaborate dishes that cost more, but even then we are talking $12-13 max. So I am not sure where the expensive reviews are coming from.  I was extremely surprised by the taste of the food. Had the Panang Curry chicken and it was very good. A thick sauce which is not typical, but very good with coconut milk drizzled on top. Good amount of chicken and good amount of rice on the side.   Bill was around $25 total for 2 people that both got iced teas, spring rolls and 2 entrees. Good prices, cozy friendly restaurant, and good food!

We really enjoyed our experience with this transport company. They were fast and friendly even on a major event weekend. We definitely plan to use them again in the future. Thanks Elite!

Fantastic new Indian restaurant tucked away in a Tempe strip mall. Had the lunch buffet and everything was amazing from the food to the service. I definitely recommend this place!!

One of my favorite places in Old Town. It gets busy on the weekends, but never overly crowded like some other bars. You can actually talk to and enjoy the people you are with. I usually just get drinks, but the food I've had here is awesome. Great staff. Great vibe.
