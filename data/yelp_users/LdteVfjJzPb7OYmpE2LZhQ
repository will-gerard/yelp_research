JUST GO! I can't say enough good things about this place. I am here at least once a week to get my weekly pork products. Almost everything is made in house and fresh with no preservatives. Believe me when I tell you they have the best tasting sausage anywhere!!! The chorizo is an absolute dream and do not leave with out some in your bag! Make sure to also try their fresh lunch meats as well, killer! If you go for sausage I highly recommend the smoked linguisa. If you live even close to or visit PHX you have to go!

AWESOME!! If you don't love this place we can not be friends... It is delicious and authentic!!  I recommend the Pho Thai, it's what I always get. The service was extremely fast and people who work there were amazing as well, very friendly. You can take out, pick up or dine in whatever you choose to do you will not be disappointed. Very reasonably priced as well. I can't wait to go back to Da Vang!!

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! This place is sooooo over-rated its not even funny! But if you like a horible wait staff and badly prepared, under-seasoned and over priced food, then by all means this is the place for you!   Our lunch started off with us being seated at a table that was about two inches away from the table next to us. Ok cool, I get it your trying to be the over packed swanky LA restraunt you cant get a table at, but come on. So we sat at our table(timed it) for 12 minutes with out anyone of the 15 waiters and waitresses walking back and forth by our table. Now I could see if we were sat in the corner in the back someone forgeting about us, but we were in the center of the dinning room! So after our waiter finally came up to us, after 12 minutes, he said something to the effect of... Oh no one told me they sat you, but yet he had walked by us and made eye contact with me several times what a joke. So he took our order with his nose in the air and im sure someting lodged in his bottom and procceded to leave. I ordered the $13 "KOBE" Beef burger medium rare. I have never had a more lousy excuse for a premium kobe beef burger in my life and trust me I know a good burger. There is no way that burger was even wagu just no flavor what so ever! My burger came out medium instead of medium rare and was underseasoned and over-cooked. I have had better burgers for $5 at a dive bar(stray cat, tempe) for real!   So after a $55 lunch that took over an hour and didn't even really leave me full or satisfied I will NEVER step foot back in this horible excuse for a restraunt and I erge you to do the same!!!
