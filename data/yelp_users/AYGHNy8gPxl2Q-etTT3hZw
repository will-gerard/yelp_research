The ideal customer for this store is someone who is heavily armed and who has the patience of Ghandi. You would need both to safely navigate the waters of this disastrous store.  This is the nearest grocer for downtown residents, and it is sad that this store misses the mark by such a huge margin.  On any day, the parking lot is covered in grease, coffee, and trash. IF by some miracle you are able to get inside without being hit up for money by tweakers, then the heavens are smiling on you.  Once inside the store, your adventure is just starting. The characters inside the store are the inspiration for the bar scene in Star Wars. Very random and sketchy. As far as the contents of the store, to be fair they have all the stuff you need, and at a reasonable price point.  The huge problem here, is everything else. During peak hours, they have very few lanes open, that is a consistent failure with this store. Customer service is also dead here, and they just don't know how to take care of customers. I feel as though the broken window theory is at play here. It seems like because they don't take care of the parking lot, and other details, the whole place goes to hell. The store also has a serious shoplifting problem. I'm not sure if they just don't staff the loss prevention unit, or if they are inept, but I have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief. It makes for an unsafe situation for everyone. They do have private security there, and the guys seem really nice, but clearly in over their heads. At this point the store is so far gone, they really need off-duty police officers to make it safe.  It really seems like this store just doesn't give a shit. At each opportunity to impress, the complete opposite happens. This place is a huge safety problem, and I would hate to have my sisters or Mom go to this place, it's really that shady. See for yourself, but be on your toes.

This local car was gets it done.  Took the sled down for a bath today, and was warmly greeted by the manager, who helps you pick your service level. I wanted to use a coupon, but couldn't get my printer to work, so I showed it from my iPHONE, and the woman didn't bat an eye, and said no problem, I could use it as a coupon.  The car wash is well done and thorough, and the price point is ok. I think the one thing they are missing, is that they don't offer rain checks. This is a problem, because that is a pretty basic expectation. Phoenix is a desert, and the definition of desert is that it rains less than 10 inches a year. We know that equates to very few rain days, so Los Olivos needs to offer a rain check.  Overall, this is a good spot. Today when I was there they were letting girl scouts sell their cookies, which I thought was sweet. Too often businesses get too big and forget about the kids, and helping out people. Well done Los Olivos.

Ryan's Pet supplies has it all, and is essentially the canine version of Disneyland.  When I first got my four-legged BFF, I was given a tip that there was a place that had dog gear nearly thirty percent less than the typical stores.  The store is centrally located on McDowell Road, and while the area is not exactly DC Ranch, you are not in the ghetto, and you will be perfectly safe even if you don't own an AR-15.  It is really important to note that Ryan's is set up as an internet order place, NOT as a retail store. This explains why the business does a few things differently than regular retail. Purses/bags either need to be left in your car, or the store will lock them up in the front. I recommend you bring your purse/bag inside, the staff is cool, and they will lock it up for you. While this may be an inconvenience , the price difference will easily make up for any hiccups.  The second tip that will save you time/energy is to know what you wish to purchase, and know how much it will cost. As mentioned before, it is a warehouse, and items are not labeled with price, it's a huge warehouse setup. They have catalogs all over the place to check prices, but my recommendation is to bring your catalog with pages marked of the stuff you want. The staff is super friendly, and will help you with where things are at. It's not always easy to know who works there, but you will figure it out, they're usually pushing metal carts, basically fulfilling online orders by pulling merchandise from the bins.  While you're here, you will find toys, brushes, shampoos, snacks, you name it! The prices are very very good, and you will be happily surprised at the difference between the other guys and Ryan's. Don't miss the kong squeaky toy line, they have fun squeaky toys that are hard to break. Also, the fleecy rope toys are great for dogs teeth, and keep them fresh and so clean clean. Avoid any rope toys, they can break down and when dogs eat them, they can do big time damage to stomach, GI etc.  Happy shopping, and lastly you CAN bring in your dog and have a helper while you shop.

Rito's easily has the best red chile and beans in the world, maybe even universe- now that Pluto is not a planet.   Don't be scared by the wussies that say the area is scary- I guess when you live in Sun City- the big city can be scary. On any given day the place will be packed with city workers, CPAs, medical staff from Good Sam, teachers and the occasional sketchy dude.   This family owned spot puts out amazingly good food. The menu is limited-but it's all about quality not quantity. I do not feel that the food is overpriced at all. You are buying fresh made food with soul-if you want heartless crap hit Taco Hell on McDowell.   If you live a charmed life and they're selling tacos when you are there- for the love of heysoos- buy three. The guacamole tacos are amazing. If they were to become illegal- I would rob old people so I could support my habit.  If only they would step up their game and offer fountain drinks- that would be great. Cans of soda do not help during hot summer months.

(This review is for take-out service)  Most people have a 'go-to' list of their favorite comfort food places, and emergency list that is used when you need tasty, predictable, and reliable.   Red Devil Pizza is at the top of my list for great NY style pizza. Forgetting fancy pizza, this place offers really tasty pizza, at a good price for what you get. Red Devil uses quality ingredients, and doesn't 'church it up' (with apologies to Joe Dirt).  If you are ready for an extra treat, ask for your pie to be 'well done', that gets you a bit of char on the crust, and takes it from good to great. The guys behind the takeout window work hard to make some of the best pie in the 602, so enjoy!

Costco is a magical place. You can prepare for armagedan, buy a hotdog, or get a case of red vines, all in one place. Some sad uninformed people think Costco and Sam's Club are the same, but for the initiated, we know that is like saying Disneyland, and the State Fair are the same. Yikes.  You really cannot go wrong with Costco. I love buying everything here, because their customer service is so strong. If something goes wrong with a product, you simply return it. Done. Have you tried that at BestBuy? Holy shit, it's easier to escape Alcatraz then deal with those blue shirted nimrods.  Costco also has some cool online exclusives, where you can buy patio furnature, food, you name it. Check it out, and enjoy.

If your wallet is burning a whole through your pocket- you better sit in a fountain quickly, because that would really hurt.  If you have extra money, and want to treat yourself, look no further. I have been to most of the valley AJ's, and this is easily the best store. It's not the biggest, newest, hippest, but it is the best.  The people at this store are rock stars, and just as they know all their customers, the customers know all the staff, and treat them like family. If you ever can, make sure to hit this spot on Halloween, the costumes are outrageous and amazing (I'm looking at you, tan bakery man).  The food here is just stellar. If you cannot find it here, you likely do not need it. As others have mentioned, generally speaking things are not the cheapest here, but you know that ahead of time by the words 'Fine foods' in the name of the business.  The produce is great, butcher is cool with funny and knowledgeable. This store has an Italian Kitchen, where they serve fresh pasta dishes, pizza, and more. Trivia, this is where legendary pizza chef Chis Bianco got his start. True story.  To recap, this place is amazing, the staff are even better than the products they serve. If you are broke or on a diet, this will not be a happy visit for you, but otherwise you're in good shape.

This review is for the Take Care Clinic at Walgreen's.  After getting over the flu a few weeks ago, I still had plugged up ears. I self-diagnosed myself with either a brain tumor or an ear infection. I looked up the closest Take Care Clinic, and took a drive down to Central and Osborn.  The clinic is in the far back corner, near the pharmacy. When you get back there, you have to check in using one of three computers, it is fast and easy. Next, you need to pick up a clipboard and fill out your info, much like you would at a doctor's office. I did my part, and then went and waited. There is not much of a waiting area, it kind of blends into the pharmacy waiting area.  After about an hour, the Nurse Practitioner, Tina, called me back. They have a private exam room, fully equipped, exactly like your doctor's office. Tina was VERY kind and warm, and took her time asking lots of questions. If you are unfamiliar with Nurse Practitioners, allow me to tell you how much they rock. To become a NP, you must have years of nursing experience, including critical care, ER, etc. After years of experience and education, then one may attend college to earn a NP masters degree. One of the best things about NPs is that they take a holistic approach to patient care. For example, I have a primary care physician, who really, really sucks. When I have an appointment, she LITERALLY brings in a digital timer set for five minutes- and then starts talking. It was amazing to see her press the timer button prior to asking why I was there.  At Take Care, the NP didn't just check my ears, she did a comprehensive exam, full vitals, etc. Luckily nothing else was going on with me, but I am confident that other issues would have been discovered by Tina.My diagnosis was correct, ear infection, not tumor- which was nice.  Overall, I would highly recommend this location, and Tina, as a health care provider. I am seriously going to just stick with that as my primary care, and skip the egg timer doctor who only likes to write scripts for things, not deal with the source of problems.  Some people have noted that the area is sketchy, and with all due respect, that is silly. This is in a populated area, it is safe. Are there people of all walks there? Sure. Is it safe, absolutely.   My only recommendation would be that Take Care hire a medical tech to assist with checking people, helping turn around the exam room, etc. As a tip, it can get busy, so get there very early. They take tons of insurance, and my visit was only $15.

If you are in the market for a bike, or need your current bike fixed up, look no further.   I've been coming to Sun Cyclery for about 11 years, and the products, service, and support are really unmatched.  Three weeks ago I bought a brand new Electra beach cruiser, which I am in love with. Someday man will be able to marry a bike, and then I can marry my bike, it's really that great.  What I love about Sun Cyclery, is the people there. They eat, sleep, and breathe bikes, and if they don't know about it, it probably doesn't matter. When I first started researching beach cruisers, Electra quickly rose to the top. I visited Sun, and was helped by Adam, who was great. I discussed what I wanted, and he helped steer me in the right direction. Another sign of a great place, when they don't automatically steer you towards the most expensive item, or recommend you buy things you don't need.  Moving on, after weeks of thinking, I picked up a sweet blue Electra cruiser, and what's great about Sun, is they have SOOOO many great accessories, you can totally trick out your bike, and make it yours. Best of all, you can personalize your bike, and not break the bank. For example, a bike I really wanted was around $600, and rather then buy that, I purchased a $230 bike, and just added on the coolest and best extras, which really made my bike mine. Btw, my tip to the bold, rather than buy a bike bell, pick up a cool horn, Sun has sumu wrestlers, sharks, pigs, etc. You name it, they have it.  When I went to purchase my bike, Joe had some awesome recommendations, I added on a white tires, and a white bike chain. I would have never thought of that, but once on the bike, it looked amazing! Did you know for around $15 you can buy a colored bike chain which totally accents your bike? They have every color, and they showed me this super cool neon green, which would look great too.  In closing, you will not go wrong at Sun. Places like this are truly a lost art. They really love bikes, and value customers. This is the rare place that you can go to and just ask questions, and learn about bikes. Don't just take my word for it, go see for yourself, and have a great time.

PCG is a really good, reliable place to grab some good food and drinks. Sometimes the service is amazing, sometimes it's pretty good, but it is always a safe bet.  I recommend the cheeseburgers and margaritas. They are very tasty and pair nicely. The atmosphere is very comfortable, dark and cozy. This is a local spot, and neighbors use it as an excuse not to make dinner at home. Give PCG a try, and it will likely be in your standard rotation, and you won't be disappointed.  The only area I think PCG could improve is with desserts. As good as the meals are, the desserts just aren't as good or enticing- which is not to say they are bad, just not on par with the rest of the place.

Rokerij is no Jokerij!  Not much new can be written about this amazing spot, so I will try and be brief. Went to the basement bar for Friday happy hour, and it was love at first sight. Cozy, dark, and welcoming- this is a place you can get lost in.  Grabbed a seat at the bar, and were warmly greeted. Ordered margaritas and some small plates, they were both outstanding. Tried numerous small plates, and each one was delicious and hit the spot.  If you like margaritas, you will be a happy camper. Also try the stuffed mushrooms, they are amazing.  After leaving my new favorite place, we went to the Taste of Scottsdale, and it was surprising that none of the food there was HALF as good as what Rokerij provided. After a few samples, my group gave up, as it wasn't fair to our stomachs to put average food with amazing Rokerij food. All in all, not a bad problem to have.

Trader Joe's is a constant winner in a sea of shady grocery stores.  This Trader Joe's location is tucked away in the Town & Country shopping plaza located in Central Phoenix. The parking lot is pretty action packed, as the parking lot is used for people going to the next door gym.  The thing I love about Trader Joe's is the great selection and quality of the food. I'm not sure who is in charge of determining the price of the items there, but I would like to by him/her a beer from the Roosevelt.  The store is always very clean and bright, and the employees are really great, and treat customers well, and I have seen some really cool exchanges between regulars and employees- it's that kind of place. I've also noticed the same people shopping there, so there are definitely regulars here.  This store is basically perfect, and could only get better if they sold something to help me with my game, because this store is packed with beautiful women, so help me out Trader Joe's and work on that.

Barb's Bakery is the only bakery you need to know about. Amazing cookies, cupcakes, pastries, and cakes. If you want to wow your friends, peers, and family- get a cake from Barb's. My favorite is white cake with whipped cream and fresh strawberries in the middle.   Try them out- you won't be dissapointed. Protip- AJ's sells Barb's iced sugar cookies, and they are amazing, but if you buy them from the source they are fresher and less expensive.

My iPHONE 4 apparently dislikes being repeatedly dropped on hard surfaces, and as a result, needed some minor surgery at Apple.  I made an appointment and went at my scheduled time. The first thing I noticed, was how many employees there are working there. I think there is nearly a 1:1 ratio of staff to customers.  I was greeted promptly and then set up with the repair tech. For some reason the part I needed wasn't in stock, which was kind of strange since four days earlier when I made the appointment- they clearly said the back glass would be replaced. I am no business tycoon, but when a customer is coming in to have a piece of glass replaced, I imagine you would want to have the piece of glass in stock-but I could be crazy. Regardless, the employee was friendly, and these things happen. He took my information and I can return again when the part is in.  While I was there I decided to try and exchange the Apple 'bumper" for something more substantial. I'm not sure why it's called a bumper, it should be called, "Piece of plastic which costs $30 and does nothing to protect your $300 phone." Perhaps that name is too wordy, so 'bumper' it is.  Many places have very difficult return/exchange policies (not my beloved Costco, of course, but lessor beings) and I was prepared for battle, but and when I asked the Apple employee if I could exchange the bumper he initially asked if I still had my packaging. I don't know about you, but if I had the packaging of something I bought four months ago, then I would likely be featured on the show 'Hoarders'. I informed him I didn't have the packaging but due to the bumper not protecting my phone, I wished to exchange it. The employee went to the back and brought back some papers and told me to pick out another case. I grabbed a snazzy little blue number and was on my way. I appreciated Apple for making the exchange when they didn't have to, well done.

CHC is a valley institution. I've been a happy customer since I was a kid. Bob the owner is always happy to see you and is a great guy.   At CHC the sliders are the stars of the show. Get several and be a happy camper. Also don't miss their shakes and fried zucchini.

I ordered a ham and turkey breast for thanksgiving. I arrived the day before thanksgiving and there was a line out the door. The staff were working super hard and even though there were 70 people ahead of me, the line went fast and within 20 minutes I had paid and was out the door.   In the future, I am told the smart move is to pickup your ham and turkey on Tuesday before thanksgiving.  Either way, you will be purchasing very delicious ham and turkey- and your guests will lift you up on their shoulders and cheer for you after they eat their meal.

El Mesquite is an outstanding neighborhood spot where tradition meets plate- and the customers are the big winners. As others have mentioned, this is a neighborhood place, where everyone knows each other, and the servers work here forever.  If you need corporate clutter, fake ambiance, licence plates on the wall, etc. this is not a place for you. If you like authentic food, warm service and spicy tasty salsa, then grab a table, and tell your taste buds to buckle up.  I first went to El Mesquite years ago when I worked downtown. I fell head over heals for their unique chips and addictive spicy salsa. Warning, it is hot, but it's not hot just to be hot, like other places (cough cough, Los Dos...).  Being that this is a Mexican restaurant, beloved by locals- you will hear Spanish, laughter, English, and sometimes a combo of  the three. I really do love El Mesquite, they put up with my crap Spanish, and you do not need to speak Spanish to be comfy at El Mesquite.   As others have said, when you arrive, you seat yourself, drinks, chips & salsa will be right behind you. Food is great here, and the price point is very good for the value and amount of food you get. I highly recommend the carne asada burro. I know right now America's Taco shop is reigning supreme, but if El Mesquite was near America's, there would be an epic battle because El Mesquite easily beats their carne asada. No bull!$%@.  Also amazing is their guacamole, unlike many places, El Mesquite doesn't put a bunch of filler ingredients to make the guac go farther. Jus tasty ingredients, and your mouth will be happy. I also want to recommend getting a quesadilla, they are really tasty and cooked to perfection.  Enjoy your trip to El Mesquite, you will not be disappointed, and if you are like me, this place will be in your rotation for 'go to' places!

This theater has it all, great value, cleanliness, and location.  If Harkins were a big box store, it would be Target, to AMC's Walmart. This location (like all other Harkins) is full of friendly employees, upscale facility, and great movies.  I can't imagine that many people would choose AMC over Harkins, but just in case you need reasons to love Harkins, here are a few.  -Loyalty rewards cup. Purchase this cup once a year, and the rest of the year you get one dollar refills. This is an amazing value! In addition to being green, it's great on your wallet, and really a considerate thing that Harkins does.  -Refill on large and XL popcorn bags. Purchase either LG or XL popcorn bags, and you get one free refill. While it is noted that it needs to be on the same visit, Harkins is nice enough to not enforce that. After you finish your movie, just fold up your popcorn bag and throw it into your empty cup, now you are ready for your next flick.  Harkins is also locally owned, so when you spend your money, more of it stays in AZ, which is great.  One last tip, if there is ever a line at the box office, just bypass the line, go inside and use one of the little automated machines, and save tons of time.

Great food but terrible take out service.   It's weird when a place has perfect pizza but terrible service.   I ordered a large pie for takeout. 30 minutes later I'm there to pick it up and it's not ready. No problem, I can hang out, and the employee said it would be three minutes.   Ten minutes later I'm just standing there, looking bored while literally five employees are just standing around, complaining that one table has someone who can't eat onions or garlic.   I finally go up and ask someone to check on my pizza. The man I asked looked like I asked him if he could deliver a baby underwater. Just totally perplexed. Then he went and checked, and sure enough it was sitting in the back. He gives me my pizza and I ask if it's sliced, and he gives me a look and says "yah, it's sliced." I get in the car and check, and sure enough- it's either not sliced- or the biggest slice of pizza in the world.   I go back in again and find an employee and ask to have it sliced.  Again, this request was met with utter confusion and Finally they found someone who could use a pizza slicer.   I'm not sure if this is the training store, or they just have crap staff, but I would avoid this location. NYPD execs would be wise to send in some mystery shoppers, I think they'd learn a lot.

Oh NYPD, two steps forward- three steps backwards. I only wish your pizza wasn't good, it would be easier to never go back.   I placed a phone takeout order and was quoted 20-25 minutes for my large pizza and garlic knots on a Sunday night. I get there 35 minutes later and walk in and wait to be acknowledged at the take-out area. There were five employees behind the counter, all facing the kitchen line. No one could be bothered to look towards the entrance to maybe greet customers. After five long minutes a guy turns his head to the side and yells out "Hey- my man!" Which apparently is NYPD speak for "Good evening- how may I help you?"  The man never asked if I needed help- and instead went back to staring at the kitchen staff working away.   Finally after ten minutes a different employee saw me and asked if I needed help. I have him my name and paid for my food. He silently walked away and went back to staring at the kitchen crew. It seemed like there was zero leadership working. It looked like a member of management was back in the kitchen- working hard helping make wings and other food- which I admire, but there was no one in front of house- which was a disaster.   After 55 minutes, my food was given to me. Not one word was mentioned as to why it took so long, or God forbid an apology offered. Just "here's your pizza". Now I realize it's a first world problem when pizza is taking 55 Minutes, and I also understand sometimes things happen. What I cannot understand is the complete and utter lack of customer service. If things are going wrong in the kitchen- or they are behind, etc- just say so. We are all human. I'd get it. But say SOMETHING. To act like it's normal that a simple order takes an hour while everyone avoids talking to customers is insane.  If it is so busy the manager has to help cook, then someone needs to be designated as front of house- and meet the needs of customers. It is inexcusable that five employees are standing with their backs to customers and no one can be bothered to greet people and expedite orders.  If things have gone so bad in the kitchen- then someone needs to take care of the customers and explain what's going on- and apologize. Offer a free dessert maybe. Or comp something. Do anything, other than ignore your customers and when they finally get their food act like everything is normal.   It doesn't matter how good the food is, if it's a total nightmare to try and get it. The level of apathy is off the charts here. This NYPD location is where customer service goes to die. Skip it, you'll thank me.

Food.......4 Stars  Takeout service...... 1 Star  Pita Jungle has tasty fresh food, it's just getting to it at this location is a consistent challenge.   Ordering over the phone is easy- but when you get there to pick it up- it's a total joke. Only once out of the last seven times was the experience timely. Last week I went there and after standing near the bar for five minutes I was finally acknowledged. Here's a pro tip- don't say "I'll be right with you" and then disappear.  Oddly- they are worse here when it's slow, which you would expect to be the opposite.   I hope they can get it together soon, it's unacceptable and the food and takeout service are incongruent.

AJ's stores are consistently good. While I wouldn't do every day shoppng here, you can get some great speciality items that really bring out the best in your cooking.   In addition the service is very good at AJ's, and the people are very warm and friendly. This store has tremendous staff in the bakery, and they are very friendly and provide great service. A great deal can be had by getting a large iced tea, freshly brewed and a cool treat, even during our hotest days.  Another treat at this store is the great hot fresh entrees you can purchase. A very wide variety is availble, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you don't feel like cooking- this place is your second home. Enjoy.

Houston's is simply a perfect restaurant. It's consistently delicious and the service and ambiance are just outstanding. It's comfy and relaxing, a little dark- but just the right amount.   The food is is awesome, I'm a devotee of the French dip, it's perfect in every way. My favorite thing there is their world class margaritas. They are hand made using fresh limes to order and they are stupendous.   In summary- this place is a gem.  Consistently consistent- serving up great food. You cannot go wrong here.

I strive to support locally owned businesses, and keep my money in AZ. I moved to the Dale and needed a closer pool supply store. Having lived in Phoenix, I know Checker Pools is the spot to go, but in Scottsdale I was unsure. Using my Yelp app I found the highest rated pool supply store in the Dale, and it was Corson's.  I paid a visit to buy pool chemical and ask questions and the guys there were super knowledgeable and very very helpful. I got what I needed and learned a great deal. I can't imagine going to a chain, where a 15 year old kid is the senior employee- and doesn't know a pool skimmer from a rubber duckie. Check out Corson's- they will get you squared away.

A co-worker told me about this hole in the wall, and I decided to check it out.   I have to say, entering this little spot, I was not overwhelmed with ambiance/decor, as the whole place is covered in wood paneling. Moving past that, I quickly learned that this is a beloved neighborhood spot, where they honor the local high school graduating class by posting class photos. Even better, they are supporters of US Military and Law Enforcement, which is a cool move when local businesses support the good guys.  I ordered the Italian combo sub with a bag of chips and took it back to the office. Unwrapping the sammie, I was really pleased to see bread which looked like it had seen the inside of an oven long enough, which is a rare find with AZ sandwich shops.  The sandwich was loaded with fresh meats and cheese, very tasty veggies, and was dressed perfectly. It was really the best sub style sandwich I have had in a long time. I loathe Subway, so Blimpies was my spot, but I have to say, Casella's is my new sandwich home. I look forward to trying more items there. The service is also noteworthy because the two ladies working at the time were really cool, didn't try too hard, and were just good people.  So, focus on the food, not the decor, and enjoy some great sandwiches. Best of all, you're supporting small, locally owned business, which is always a great thing.

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Casella's Deli!!!!  If I could give this place ten stars I would in a heart beat.  I truly can't decide what I adore more, the amazing sandwiches, or the warm, friendly family that runs the joint?  Today I took two co-workers to lunch, and when we arrived, we were greeted  so warmly and sincerely, it was like we were family. This is not to be confused with forced corporate niceness that you see at Safeway- this is the real deal.  It gets better. One of my friends didn't think he was hungry, so I ordered a sub, and my other buddy ordered a cheese steak. The employee took or order and invited us to grab a seat.  A short while later, the sweet woman said, "Hey boys- come and get it." When my other friend saw how good the food was, I ordered him a sandwich, and when I went to pay, the woman told me that since it was almost 2:00pm, the sandwich would be free, as they have a buy two, get one after two. I think it was like 1:45, and I thought that was SO cool. Where else does that happen? Let me help you with the answer- nowhere!  You and I both know there are places that won't give you a deal if you are ONE MINUTE early, let alone really early.  On to the food, the sub I got, the Italian cold cut combo, was amazing. Fresh EVERYTHING, great bread, etc. It was simple, delicious and clearly made with pride.  In closing, this place is just a gem, seriously. They are getting ready to celebrate 34 years, and my only regret is just now finding them.  Give Casella's a shot, you will not be disappointed. If you like great food, warm people, and interdependent businesses- this is your place!  Two quick tips:  1. Like many small businesses, they take cash only  2. They are located on the SE corner of Granite Reef and McDonald. Enter from Granite Reef, they are on the South end of the complex.

This is easily my favorite Italian restaurant- dining there is like being at your best friend's house.   First- it's important to note it is cash only.  Just hit an ATM and grab some cash. You won't need much- the prices are very very reasonable.   The food here is great! Hearty, tasty- and packed with flavor. My favorite thing to get is the eggplant parm appetizer. It's so damn good.   You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and keep your eyes out for the special "Pasta Alex" it's so tasty.   Save room for dessert- the cheesecake and cannoli are freshly made by the owners (Pasquale) wife.   This awesome restaurant is BYOB, so feel free to grab some beer or wine and pair with your meal.   Last but not least- they do catering and it is tremendous. They catered several family events and as usual- the food and price point cannot be beat.   Enjoy your meal and say hi to Pasquale for me.

Philly Cheese, Please!  If you're like me, you're not wearing any pants right now. Also, if you're like me, you have a few places you frequent where the food is good but not perfect, and the service is fine, but not amazing- and yet you still like the place.  That pretty much sums up Uncle Sams. Imperfection meets comfort food and consistency. While UCs is not a first date spot, it's a great place to grab a lunch with a buddy, co-worker, etc.   I usually get the mushroom cheese  steak, with fried mushroom & zucchini appetizer. I'm not sure who invented beer battering veggies, but I want to hug him/her. Pretty much- if it's fried at UCs, it will taste good!  On my most recent visit, the service was just outstanding. It was weird how good things went, much like going to Target and getting Nordstrom's style service. Drinks were always full, plenty of napkins, etc. It was refreshing because I often dial my expectations down at spots like these, where you're not there to be pampered.  In closing, Uncle Sam's is a good spot. Is it amazing? Nope. Life altering? Uh uhh. But it is good, consistent, and recently had terrific service. Sometimes that's just enough to make for a good outing.

Sometimes there is such thing as too much of a good thing, in this case, greetings. Much like how Safeway grocery store now has this kind of forced pleasantries thing going, Oreganos is at it as well.  My coworker and I were greeted warmly by the nice host. Within the next two minutes, we were welcomed/greeted probably 23 times. I kept waiting to be asked if I was saved, or get a free copy of the watchtower. Please don't get me wrong, I love manners, they are great- like beer, but a little goes a looooong way.  My buddy and I order lunch, a couple of slices and cheesy garlic bread. I think I jinxed us, because I 'checked in' with my excitement about cheesy garlic bread, and the appetizer never arrived.   Our lunch arrived, and as we scan the table discover there is no silverware, napkins, etc. After waiting a few minutes our server shows up and sees that we have made no forward progress, and brings us our silverware, and made a comment about forgeting the silverware. Totally cool, and I thought he addressed it, but no harm done. The server then asks if we ever got our appetizer, and we told him we did not. His reply would have made sense if I told him the sun would rise tomorrow, "Oh." Kind of matter of fact, but there was no attempt at service recovery, or making it right. I would have been really pleased with a "Oh, sorry about that." or "Can I buy you guys dessert?" etc. Nope, didn't happen.  It is a good spot, and they are insanely busy during lunch, but I think it would be good for them to remember to pay attention to details, it is important.   The pizza was just ok, nothing to write home about. I think next time I will check out NYPD, they have great pie.

Ray's Pizza is a good, go-to spot to grab a slice or a full pie. I'm not sure why there are 5,000,000 Ray's Pizzas throughout the country, because there cannot be that many dudes named Ray, but I digress.  Anytime you walk in, you are greeted very warmly, and there are always at least five different types of slices available. In addition, Ray's has Sicilian slices, which not many places do- which is also a bonus. After you pick your slices they go in the pizza ovens for a quick reheat- and the slices come out and taste amazing.  The dining area is vast and clean, with plenty of TVs to watch as you eat your pie. All in all you cannot go wrong here, unless you are weird and get a salad at a pizza place, which in that case you are strange and your friends talk about you when you're not around.

This is a review for the pizza take out.  There are a few levels of pizza in the 602.  Top tier is Pizzia Bianco, Cibo, Federal PIzza, et al. Those are NOT daily pizza choices, to me they are special occasions.   Everyday kind of awesome pizza is Red Devil! Light years ahead of NYPD, Streets, etc. this place is legit! I highly recommend trying the pizza 'well done' which gets you more char on the crust. It's super good. This place also has really great wings, which surprised me. I ask for all drums, as those little wings aren't worth the trouble.  Keep up the good work Red Devil. You are an oldie but a goodie.

This place is great for grabbing some amazing carne y pollo asada. Be a grill hero and grab some meat, fresh salsas, tortillas- etc. everything you need is here!  The store is very clean- everything is easy to find, and the service is friendly and charming.   Don't stress out if your Spanish is limited or non-existent. Go in, be friendly and you will be treated warmly and have no problems.   I highly recommend grabbing some of this tasty steak & chicken and having friends over. It's super easy to grill and the taste is exceptional.   Do work mijos.

First Watch is a local chain that serves up average breakfast food. This place isn't terrible, but it is also not remarkable in any way.  The booths are made of slotted wood, and for some reason they haven't been updated in years, resulting in sub-par seating that will leave horizontal lines on anyone wearing shorts.  The food is ok, not exciting or great, just ok. The coffee is bad, it looks like coffee but tastes like brown water. Additionally they don't have fresh half&half, they have the little individual cups similar to Circle K.  For this visit, the HUGE downfall was the service. I won't describe this person because I don't want any harm coming to her job, but if our server wasn't on meth, then I don't like cupcakes (HINT- I love cupcakes). The server was jittery, confused and racing around unnecessarily. Making things more annoying, the booth near us apparently had some of the servers friends dining, and they were so loud, I thought I was at a club. When we were seated the server yelled over to us asking us for a drink order. For the next ten minutes she sat with her pals and cackled about something they were watching on a smart phone.  It was sketchy too because they started talking pretty loudly about sex acts, and other things that aren't the best fit when there are tables of kids within five feet. I have a great sense of humor, but 11:00am on a Saturday isn't the best time to get cheeky at breakfast. In a different restaurant, they might politely ask the people who are yelling loudly and having inappropriate conversations to dial it down, but here the server was sitting with them, and was part of it.  Interestingly, all the other staff we encountered were very nice and appropriate, but our server was SO poor, that it just couldn't save the outing. Our food was brought to us by a lovely server who we wished would have been ours from the start. After our food was brought out, our server never stopped by again. It was funny however, that she had to walk by our table five times to go back and sit with her friends, and cackle some more- but couldn't stop to see if we needed more water (yes) Luckily my dining pal has a sense of humor and just rolled her eyes, but I would be livid if I brought my Mom, etc. there.  In closing, I cannot recommend this place for a meal. It's not terrible, but with the economy being so sketchy, it's nice to spend money somewhere that is comfortable and where you're not ignored, or served by someone who likely cannot pass a drug test.

Great locally owned theater, in a formerly at-risk area.  This Harkins location is outstanding. It is nothing to open a new, shiny theater, but to keep it maintained in tip top shape, and really care? Now THAT is something special, and that is what you get at this theater.  If you can remember waaay back when to the old Christown theater, where you had to bring a gun and knife to safely enter and exit, you will be happy to know that things have changed greatly. Both the theater and parking lot are safe, clean, and well lit.  Much like there are Elvis Vs. Beatles people, there are Harkins Vs. AMC people. Personally, I don't think it is even a close race. Harkins offers souvenir drink cups you can buy, and the WHOLE year, refills are only $1. Additionally, you can purchase a large popcorn, and you get one free refill. So you can buy a large popcorn and save the bag, bring it back your next visit and get a free refill, and then spend a buck getting a large drink. You simply cannot beat that deal, and for me, in addition to better chairs which rock, Harkins cannot be beat.  Also, check with your employer's HR dept. Many have discounted tickets for sale, where you can get tickets for $6, what a deal!  Cheers.

Nice local indoor shooting range. Good customer service and the prices are fair for gun rental and range fees. On Fridays they have ladies day, so you lucky ladies get a smoking deal. They have fun targets, I recommend the Zombie version, it's fun to shoot at.

I have been a Shooter's World Phoenix customer for about four years and during that time I have enjoyed taking classes there, using their shooting range, and shopping at their retail store. The customer service is very good, and they treat you like a valued customer, not like an interruption of an Angry Birds marathon.  I think it is great when things go smoothly, it's somewhat easy for a good place to continue on the right path, but the true test is what happens when the road gets bumpy. On a recent trip to Shooter's World, I had a very disappointing experience, and shared that here. While the customer service was on-point as usual, a rule was applied which I felt was inappropriate for the circumstances, however I didn't have any recourse at the time, or anyone who I could discuss the issue with further.   A few days after the incident, a very kind and concerned owner, Lisa, reached out to me and inquired about what had happened, and she apologized profusely. Lisa explained that there was some confusion about when and why policies are enforced, and in my case an error was made. Lisa was extremely kind and helpful, in an attempt to problem solve and correct a hiccup. I was very appreciative of her time and interest in correcting a situation which she had no part in making.  We all have off days, and any industry is susceptible to that. I only wish every business was run like Shooter's World, where if a mistake happens, it is owned, corrected, and a win-win situation is developed for all. It really meant a lot to me and my guest that day, and I look forward to many years of loyal patronage to Shooter's World Phoenix. If you want to check out a comfortable, non-stuffy place to enjoy shooting sports, I think you owe it to yourself to check out Shooter's World Phx!

Wow, this place misses, by a loooooong shot.  Food wise, this place should be rated zero stars, but the server was SO nice and did such a great job, I had to bump it up. If I could rate service alone, I would give this place four stars.  Here's the breakdown.  I've been here probably over a dozen times over ten years, and it's pretty much always the same. Ambiance is ok, clean but dated. As others have mentioned, the only thing to order here is fajitas, and I did, preceded by a cheese crisp appetizer, which I read was great on Yelp.  In short, the simplest stuff at Fajitas is the problem. Their 'salsa' is literally tomato paste and maybe some powdered garlic? It is truly bland and tasteless, remarkably so. It's almost like jr. high cafeteria lady dropouts are making the salsa, it is just a train wreck. I asked our server if they had a hotter (read: flavorful) salsa, and he brought over some hot sauce.  The fajitas arrived and they were fair. Portions were good and tortillas were fresh-ish. For some reason the fajitas arrived with raw onions and a trace amount of bell peppers. Maybe i'm doing it wrong, but I was accustomed to grilled onions and peppers- and this wasn't that.  The service was the shining star at this spot. Our server was awesome, very attentive and kind, without being annoying. I took my nephew and nieces out to dinner, and there were tons of extra requests, and the server (Mike?) was just really great- so much so that I tipped 30% and let the manager on duty know they had a rock star working there.  If this place could just put some effort into the salsa, and a bit more attention to detail, it could be great, but for now I recommend you skip it, and hit up a Mom & Pop spot.

This place is the best kept secret in AZ. Wonderful people doing a great job in caring for our four legged family members.  I highly recommend this clinic for affordable, world class care. They even helped answer a non-spay question, which I thought was very kind and helpful.  Being a responsible pet parent doesn't have to be expensive, and thanks to the Spay Neuter Clinic, you and your beloved pet will be in great shape!  Boom.

The Arizona Humane Society is a World Class organization. For starters, the Dobbins campus is absolutely stunning. If Disneyland were to commision an amazing dog/cat adoption facility- it wouldn't be as cool as this place. This expansive campus has it all, dogs, cats, a cool store where you can buy great items, and know that the money goes to a great cause.  The dog kennels are airy and bright, and smell better than most resuarants. The dogs are clearly well cared for and th AZHS staff and volunteers do a great job of giving love to the little guests while they are awaiting their forever homes.  Do yourself, and your family a favor- and pick up your next family member at AZHS. A better deal cannot be found, and you will be saving a dog, who will give you years of loyalty, love, and compainionship.  Great job Arizona Humane Society, you make Arizona a better place.

If you are a Yelper, chances are better than good that you appreciate cool kitchen stuff. Williams-Sonoma is the Disneyland of cool kitchen stuff, and the weekend before Xmas I went out in search of gifts like any good procrastinating guy. The store was bustling and busy, but the staff were great and very helpful. They had samples of this amazing hot chocolate that puts Starbucks to shame. My brother and I were arguing about what a weird little tool did, and we found an employee named Claudia, who was friendly, funny, and helpful. She explained what it was for, which sucked, because it meant my little brother was correct, which pains me to no end. Claudia had some great tips on cooking gadgets, and really made the shopping experience fun. Well done WS!

Yikes, it's fitting that this is a seafood spot, because this restaurant is a sinking ship.  My coworker was hungry and wanted some soup, so I agreed to go to lunch with her. We arrived at around 12:30 on a Tuesday, the parking lot was half full.  We were greeted right away, and shown to our booth. A friendly server greeted us and took our drink orders. Coming back with the drinks, the server (Allison, I think?) did a good job of explaining the menus, showing us the specials etc. The server provided a really good impression that things were going to be very good.  My friend and I ordered lunch, she ordered the salad/soup combo and I ordered the breaded shrimp lunch (way to branch out, I know...) Our server brought us some tasty rolls, and was quick to refill our drink glasses. After about 25 minutes, our server again came over to check on us, and it looked like she was surprised to see the absence of plates on our table. The server returned to our table with more rolls and told us it would be a few more minutes.  My friend commented that it had taken forever for our food to arrive, and I could not disagree with her. I could see a long delay if we ordered some intricate dish, which was complex and required time (calzones, etc) but soup is already made, salad is just lettuce and dressing, and my entire lunch required mere minutes in a deep fryer.  About ten minutes later our lunches arrived, and we were both truly puzzled as to what could have possibly taken so long. The place was not full at all, so it wasn't that the kitchen got overwhelmed- I really don't know the disconnect.  I do not blame the server for the kitchen having epic failures. I do wish she would have stopped by and acknowledged the issue. Tell me anything:  "Hey, the kitchen lost your order, they're making it now."  "Sorry, there was a knife accident in the kitchen, and they needed your order slip to stop the bleeding."  "Sorry, I got busy and forgot to put in your order."  "Hey, I am not sure what is going on, but it is odd that you don't have lunch still."  ANYTHING. Just communicate. Clearly there is an issue if we have been to lunch for nearly an hour and still do not have lunch.  Ironically (TRUE STORY ALERT), an elderly couple using a walker to get around was seated after us, and ate, paid, and left BEFORE we got our lunch. It reminded me of the movie Office Space, it was great. When it came time to pay the bill, we made it a point to tip 25%, we were pretty sure that if others had as slow a lunch as we did, diners would mistakingly ding the server, when it was a kitchen issue.  In conclusion, as we got to the parking lot my peer told me she would never return, and sadly I had to agree. It's a weird thing when you remove a restaurant from your future rotation, but it had to happen. It is not cool to take an hour and a half to have a 'quick lunch' mere minutes from the office.

Everyone values different things when out shopping. Some only care about getting the latest styles, for others, price is king. For me, it's all about customer service. I work hard to earn my money, and I spend it at places that treat me with respect, not like I am annoying them.   Nordstrom's is exactly that place. The customer service here is world class, and they know how to take care of their customers. They have an amazing selection, and some decent deals, but their biggest product is service. It's so nice to come to their stores and be treated well by employees who care. Well done Nordy's!

Yikes. This place is cool looking, and has nice service- but the food is totally lacking.   My friend and I went for lunch and were seated within a few minutes. I saw there was a free chips & salsa with Yelp check in. I requested that, with a side of guac. I was told that the guac would be $5. Seemed kinda steep but maybe they make it super well- so I ordered it.   Guac arrives and it is in a small cup- that could fairly be priced at 2-3 bucks- if it's quite good. This stuff was like a movie prop- it looked right but had 0.0 flavor. It was so odd. In addition to being a small serving, & having no flavor - there were also two golf ball sized chunks of underripe avocado. Like you couldn't cut then with a knife. So weird. Literally no flavor. How do you fug up guac? It's avocado, garlic, salt, lime, onion, some type of pepper. Not here though.   For lunch I had the red chilie chimi. Again- it looked nice- but really lacking in flavor and crispness of the tortilla. That came with rice and beans- both passable but that's about it.   Throughout- our server was sweet and did a nice job, without which I could only leave one star. Oddly when the bill arrived our chips and salsa were on there. Our server told us she would take them off when we pay. It's weird because if you're planning your tip off the total- but the total is off by nearly four bucks?..... Also the $5 guac was now $6 on the bill. So our chips and salsa were "free" but a small side of anemic guac was $6?  It's sad when the guac at Chipolte crushes this restaurant.    So buyer beware- cool atmosphere, weak food. In the future when I'm seeking New Mexican cuisine I will hit up Richardson's in Phx.

Good food + weak shaty service= dos Stars.   Heard this spot was good and wanted to try it out. Went there for lunch on a Thursday and sat in the patio area. After waiting 15 minutes a server graced us with his presence.   For some reason, while they serve carne asada tacos, they lack the technology to offer carne asada burros on the menu.  For anyone not familiar with burro 101, here are the required steps in creating a burro.  1. Tortilla (sometimes called a "wrap", but only by gavachos) 2. Filling (meat, veggies, fiberglass, etc)  In looking at the menu, they have all The prereqs to make my dreams come true.   Fast forward to lunch arriving, it was good, but my burro was covered in red sauce. Weird that the server didn't think to ask if I was good with that?  This is going no where quickly, so allow me to land the plane.   PROs  -Good food -Decent atmosphere  CONs -Slow service -Like chips? Expect to pay for anything above one serving. Since it takes so long to get your food- you really have no choice but to survive on chips and sugar packets.  -Slow service -High prices for what you get. I can see paying for chips if it's a little taco Stand, but this place is a bit pricey to Have to pay for chips.

Yowza, if I could give this spot -5 stars, I would.  As mentioned in earlier reviews, service is truly non-existent.  It's quite remarkable at the level of 'who gives a crap' that is on display here.  I took a co-worker there for a holiday lunch, as she has a dish there she is crazy about. We arrive at one, and are seated right away. Drinks get to us eventually and we are able to order. My friend ordered a house special, and I ordered steak fajitas.  While waiting for lunch to arrive, our drinks ran dry, and we also ran out of chips. While the restaurant was slow, with only a handful of tables occupied- the service was still a complete disaster. The wait staff was five feet away behind the bar hanging out, not paying any attention to anything.  Eventually our food arrives, and they must have invented a new strain of white beef, because my steak fajitas are white and look like chicken nuggets, only drier. I asked our befuddled server if I was looking at chicken, and he smiled and replied that it was. I reminded him that I ordered steak, at which point he made a gas face. There was no attempt at service delivery, making it right, etc. To end the silent standoff, I told him I would just give the chicken a go.  I am really laid back, and I like chicken, so I thought it might taste okay. As it turned out, the chicken was SO dry, and it was shaped like chicken nuggets. I have never seen chicken shaped like that, that was not part of  a meal you order at a drive thru. Moving past the shape, they were dry and truly tasteless. To replicate this dish, you would need old chicken, no flavor, and a hatred for the people you were cooking for.  Wrapping up the cluster that was our lunch, my friend ordered some takeout to bring back to her co-worker. We waited for another 20 minutes and no one ever showed up at our table, so I went to the bar and asked about our bill and takeout. Finally I was able to pay and get the takeout bag, which I gave to my pal. I jokingly told her to check it and make sure it wasn't screwed up too, and she did. *** Spoiler alert, they messed up the takeout too. It was completely wrong. I brought the container to the server who replied with "Wow, everything is messed up." Cheers to you, good sir- we agree!  While they went to fix it, I saw inside the kitchen, and it was pretty dirty. I can truly say that was my last and final trip to Frank and Lupe's. The food isn't terrible, but the service, price point, and utter lack of giving a shite make it a no go for me. There clearly is no one there to manage the business and ensure that people are being cared for, and that quality control is happening. Do yourself a favor and find another spot.  Hell, at this point Taco Bell on Thomas & Scottsdale is a better option. At least you know going into it that the food will be mediocre.

Yelp comes through again. Had some dress slacks that needed some TLC, and did a Yelp search, which helped me discover Zizzo.  Long story short- this place is wonderful. Phil and his Dad own this place, and it is staffed with true artists, who will help bring your threads to their fullest potential. Amazing prices, and Phil is hilarious, and made me laugh like crazy. Do yourself a favor- and if you need any work done- just see Phil and Carmen- they will take great care of you.

Pei Wei is consistently fresh, tasty, and a good value.  This location is no different, and during the rainy storm of the century last week, it did the trick for a great lunch.  I don 't know a ton about this area, so I can't help much, other than saying it's in a strip mall, surrounded by other retail stores. If you've been in one Pei Wei, you've essentially been in them all. The one strange thing with this location, is that near the drink section, there are a row of bar style seats. They are nice looking, but when people are sitting in them, they pretty much block the pathway from the beverage section to the main seating area. Weird.  Anyway, if you are in need of a tasty, predictable lunch, this is a good spot.

AJ's is Arizona's finest grocery store, without exception. I love shopping at AJ's because not only am I shopping local, I am also getting great items that are hard to find elsewhere. This AJ's has literally every option you can imagine, from fresh baked pizza to amazing sushi served to order. I love AJ's because they allow the employees to be themselves and not be so corporate and only speak off a script. Employees are the cornerstone of AJ's and they rock.  My only complaint about this AJ's, is really not about AJ's at all, it is about the weird, cranky customers. There are regular non-crusty people, but every time I go, I also see some nasty mean people, totally being jerks to the staff. Listen, I get it, you're important, you have a range rover, you're wearing LuLu Lemon pants, I understand. The thing is, these employees work HARD, and don't need you barking orders at them as if they are Marine Corps recruits. Also, if they are out of something this is NOT a personal attack on  you, so chill the F out.  Keep up the good work AJ's, we love you!

Einstein's really defines mediocrity. At best, it's just ok, on average, you will probably regret your trip.  For starters, this location is not set up very efficiently. For some reason, you walk in, then have to hang a hard right- navigate around people sitting down- then arrive at the counter.   Jumping forward, the bagels are really, really boring. They're not terrible, they won't make you sick, but they're just so uninspired. Scottsdale has a handful of good, locally owned bagel stores where you can get a better bagel, at a much better price. After eating a bagel from there, I always kinda shake my head and ask myself why I don't just drive north a bit to a better bagel? Damn my laziness.   I have a feeling that the same people that love Einstein's are the same people who think Applebees is amazing, and Walmart is a great place to shop. It's not their fault really, but sad nonetheless.

It is hard for me to review an oil changing place, because there's not much to evaluate-or is there?  We all have to get our oil changed, and i'm sure that everyone has been to the good, the bad, and the ugly.  I went to this Jiffy Lube last Thursday while it was raining. I pulled up at around 11:30 and there was no waiting. The guys directed me in, and asked me to have a seat in the lobby. Now, all those things happen at EVERY place, here is where this Jiffy Lube kicked butt.  My total  time there was around 18 minutes, start to finish. While they worked on my car, I kept waiting for the obligatory "Uhm, you need this service, and this service, and this is broke, and that is broken."  Shockingly, that moment never came. The only time they called me, was when it was time to check out, and pay. The employee was required to read off the computer what services the manufacturer recommended, but after he saw my glazed over expression, he ran through all of it like a Barrett Jackson auctioneer, which was greatly appreciated.  At no time did they try and sell me anything. Even my air filter was ok, and they told me it's fine.  That may seem like a simple thing, but it's really not. These places usually push things on you in a way that makes religious missionaries look passive.  In closing, I highly recommend this store. The guys there were cool and laid back, and seem like they would rather have a customer for life, than screw you over once and never see you again. Well done JL! (that's insider talk for Jiffy Lube)

I'm not exactly sure why, but Fiesta Burrito blows away the 'somebody-bertos' which are all over the valley.  My first clue that this place would be better than the average was seeing the fire truck and ambulance parked outside. Firefighters are typically great cooks, and if they are eating at a place, it is a great sign.  My most recent visit, I was hungry, in a hurry, and wanted something tasty. I was in the area and hit Fiesta Burrito. I got a carne asada burro and a plain cheese crisp. Even though the line of cars was six deep, the line moved smoothly and before I knew it, I was paying for my lunch.  Getting back to the office, I was pleased to discover a tasty burro and the cheese crisp was very good. Please note, this is not America's or Gallo, but it is good in a pinch. As a bonus, you're eating at a place called 'Party Burrito'! How can you lose?  Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed.

I divorced Sparklett's water because for $44 a month, it just wasn't worth me being a lazy bastard. I owned my cooler, and as a new homeowner was trying to keep expenses under control.  I did a Yelp search and found this neighborhood Watering (literally) hole. W&I is located in the Albertson's plaza, near LoLo's. While the parking lot is packed, this considerate little store has two dedicated parking spots, and I have never had an issue parking.  My first visit, the owner was working, and he was so kind and helpful. I didn't have any lids, so he threw them in for free (usually $1 a piece) and he told me about the prepaid card which saved me $5.00 instantly. The owner proudly described how his water goes through more filtering and more importantly is fresher than Sparklett's, who has to mass produce millions of gallons of water ahead of time. W&I makes water on demand, and honestly the water I got tastes JUST like high-end FIJI water, so the owner wasn't exagerating.  Last but not least,, this location has Thrifty's Ice Cream, which any local will tell you is amazing. You can even get a cone, or freshly packed pint.  Great job Water & Ice, you have a customer for life!

This is yet another reason why Yelp is rad. I was looking for a locally owned place to pick up some carne asada to throw on the grill. Yelp pointed me in the direction of Carneceria El Rancho, which is Spanish for "You can buy lots of cool shit here".  The store is super fun, and has tons of cool specialty items that you can use to prepare a great Mexican meal. The butcher's corner is great and they have tons of fresh meat, at great prices. I was prepared to use my epic Spanish skills, but the man working there was sadly deprived of that little treat, as his English was perfect. Personally I am a fan of the "When in Rome" philosophy, so I think it's moronic for someone to go to a specialty Mexican food store and be uncomfortable with the native language to that region- but hey- that's just me.  Moving on, I bought carne asada, and some pollo- and you can decide if you want the marinade poured into the bag of carne, I recommend it, and there is no extra charge. Keep in mind you don't want to have it marinading for longer than eight hours, unless you like bubble gum burritos.  The place also has Mexican coke (think beverage, not Scarface) and tons of salsas, tortillas, treats, etc. Essentially- they have it all.  The cashier was adorable and (rightly) proud of the store and all the cool stuff they have. I've been back three times since, and each time have received great service and merchandise.  Go here, buy stuff- grill it- and prepare to be told you are a hero.

This Scottsdale institution is epic in every way. Great food, great deli, and great service. If you are in a hurry, the food can take a little while during the lunch rush, so take advantage of calling ahead of ordering so it will be ready when you get there.  In addition to the great food, they have deli items for sale, specialty pasta, bread, wine, etc. Everything you need to be a hero in the kitchen.   The one thing that's a bit odd are the signs on the soda fountain admonishing people not to steal soda, if they have a free water cup. That seems more like a sign you'd see in a Circle K in a shitty area- not a great deli. Maybe they can lose the sign, it kinda isn't in keeping with the classy feel of the food, ambiance and people.

Discount Tire is the ONLY place to purchase and service tires. Could you save ten bucks at Costco? Maybe- but you will not beat the service at Discount Tire. SInce I got my first cars years and years ago, I knew to go to Discount, since that is where my family took our cars.  I went to this location to have my tires rotated. Something I learned a few years ago is that you can call and make appointments at Discount Tire, so I called the day before and made an appointment- which speeds things up and gets you out faster.  This location was recently remodeled and it looks great. Comfy soft chairs, bottled water and candy to snack on, it's very nice. As with the other employees, they are amazing and work SO hard. Discount Tire has a customer for life, and I really appreciate the great customer service, especially when I am receiving a free tire rotation.  Well done Discount Tire, you're doing it right.

I love this place- and I'll tell you why. It's been around forever- and still has that special something. Honestly these scores don't reflect the awesomeness of Sunsplash. I've gone there since I was a kid, I learned how to be a bank robber getaway driver with the go-carts, and I've played goofy golf like a boss. The waterpark attractions are fun- they added that cool toilet flushing ride- which is a blast. I've also attended a few kids birthday parties- and everyone had a great time, even though I didn't get candy from the piñata- first world problems.   Reading some of the other reviews doesn't give me much hope for humanity or our future. Kind of reminds me of the movie Idiocracy.  For those of you new to AZ, during late summer- there are monsoons. For some reason God refuses to notify the waterpark when these storms will hit - so on occasion they have to clear the water so that guests don't die due to lightning. I know I live on the edge- but death by lightning is not my thing- so good lookin out Sunsplash. If for some reason they need to close for safety- they happily provide a rain check that's good for the rest of the season, which I think is rad.    So, to recap- this place is legit- fun, and a great time to kill a day. Sunsplash was good enough to film Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure- and it will be good enough for your excellent adventure. Do work.

It's hard to write something new about this Phoenix landmark. It is great, the food is delicious, the service is old school class with modern charm. Everyone has their spot when asked where is their favorite place to eat, and Durant's has no competition for me. If you are going for a special occasion, make sure to mention that when making a reservation...

Cibo is a great spot for pizza and ambiance.  Like many successful places, sometimes service takes a hit- when it gets busy at peak times. One weak link is a male server who consistently spaces out and gets orders wrong. I am a fan of people who don't need to write down the order, but then when you get multiple things wrong- it's not so bueno. Luckily the food is so good, it eclipses occasional sub-par service.  I recommend the Diavola pizza with anti-pasta to start. Enjoy.

Love, love, love this place.  Got there at 7:15 on a Sunday, waited only five minutes and got right in. Today they had a great steak & eggs special, it was out of this world. I brought a friend who had never been there, and she loved her food as well. One thing I recommend is to order a pancake on the side (in case no one in your party orders a full order). The pancakes are unreal, they are SO good, and if you've never tried them, do yourselves a favor, and try them.  As usual, service was on point, and even though the place is packed and super busy, everything was taken care of. When I read negative reviews of the place, all I ever see is complaints because there is a wait, etc.  It is important to note, this is NOT an IHOP, or Goodegg. You WILL wait to get in, and it is worth every minute of the wait. If you're not able to do that, then perhaps you should go elsewhere. Also, if you have more than a party of four, please consider either breaking into smaller groups, or go somewhere else.   The food at Matt's Big Breakfast is thoughtfully planned, prepared, and executed. If you haven't been yet, enjoy it!

I admit, I am a loyal Harkin's fan. With the refill cups, and popcorn refill, it's hard to beat Harkins. This theater features art films and indie films, and is a quaint little theater. I do wish they had the stadium style seating, and nice comfy chairs, but what are you going to do, we can't have everything. I am hoping sometime they update the place, but it is what it is, and a great place to see smaller release films.

Whenever possible I like to support local business, so I tried Copper Star.  I ordered a coffee and a sandwich. The sandwich was surprisingly good. I expected a decent (at best) sammy and I was shocked at how tasty it was.   The coffee was good, but the sandwich stole the show. Who knew you could get a great sammy at a coffee shop.   The only concern I had with my visit was the employee who helped me. Before I dive into that, let me just say I'm young and not conservative. That being said- it is distracting/disturbing to have so much "art" on your face. This employee had massive amounts of eye makeup, paired with multiple face piercings and what looked like a tea saucer implanted in their chin. It was distracting to the point that I had a hard time making eye contact.  Again- I'm all about expressing yourself, but maybe don't be excessively tatted, overly pierced and make up applied by a sugared up five year old- all at the same time. Pick one look per day.

Back in the day, I had to go to San Diego to shop at IKEA, and I am such an IKEA nerd, when they first got to Tempe, I was there at the first day when they opened for families and friends of employees only.  This IKEA is exceptional in nearly every way. I'll try not to bore you with the standard stuff you know, instead I will share a recent experience.  In an effort to step up my home aesthetics, two months ago I purchased some under counter lights, but I realized I got the wrong kind. Two days ago, I brought the item back to IKEA, but totally forgot the packaging or receipt. Jeremy at the return counter politely informed me that I needed to know what day I purchased it, so they can process the return.  As you might imagine, I was on the phone with my bank for about ten minutes, waiting on hold for them to search for the day, when Jeremy approached me and told me he had found the date, and wanted me to check. Sure enough, he went back THREE months, and was able to find my purchase. He promptly cranked out my store credit and even wrote down the correct item number, so I could be sure not to repeat my mistake. His outstanding level of customer service, was really refreshing and kind. He didn't have to go above and beyond and search for the info, especially when I was dumb and didn't bring any of the items which would have made this easy.  Thanks Jeremy, and IKEA- you guys are rock stars!  Cheers.

IKEA, beautiful IKEA. What a great store in every way.   Amazing selection, great prices, fun shopping environment, ethical business practices- this place has it all.   While this furniture isn't family heirloom material- it is affordable, functional, and cool- and unless you treat your stuff with zero respect- will last you many years.   They have a great cafe which features breakfast, lunch, and dinner- at insanely affordable prices. Today I paid for breakfast for two and it was $6.03. The food was very high quality and would have cost about $24 at any local breakfast spot.   It's always fun to walk around and look at how cool they can make a small space work. It's like visiting 100 strangers and seeing their cool houses.   Their kitchen stuff is epic and their prices cannot be beat. Again- this isn't Williams Sonoma- but it is quality stuff without the insane prices. You cannot go wrong.   You can just about fully equip an empty house with all the great stuff at IKEA.   Do yourself a favor and check it out. If you want to avoid the huge crowds- check out this place an hour before closing- or most any weekday. Happy hunting.

Corbin's is the real deal! Great food, beautiful venue, and stellar customer service.  Went to lunch at Corbin's last week, and we were the first ones in on a Friday.  We were warmly greeted and seated at a four top. Instantly we had our drinks and app in, and then selected lunch.  We both had the BLT, with fries on the side, and it was delicious. Something like a BLT should be easy to get right every time, but I am sure you have had a cruddy one in the past. Each element of the sandwich was perfect, great fresh bacon, and the rest of the elements were fresh and crisp. I was really impressed at the amount of bacon this sandwich contained, you'd think that would be the most expensive part of the sammie, and the first thing to skimp on- but not here.  The restaurant is really impressive looking. Polished concrete floors, custom tables with hand painted tops, steel and glass accents. With all the contemporary stuff, it still managed to be warm and inviting, and I think that is where the human element comes in. From the bussers to the Manager, everyone was outstanding in their customer service delivery. I find it refreshing when people are proud of their product, and the work they do. The manager (Kevin, I think) came by and asked us how our lunch was. Now, while that happens all over, he truly wanted to know, it wasn't a walk-by "Heyhowwasyourlunchtoday?Greatthanks!" Kevin answered a few questions, and then asked us our names and shook our hands. I was really impressed with the warm, genuine service.  I highly recommend this restaurant, it is great in every aspect. I look forward to trying it again, I hear their brunch is off the charts. One tip, parking gets tight, but there is street parking and a lot, so you should be okay.

The Roosevelt has it all. Amazing beers, craft food and exceptional service.   Set in a lovingly restored home, this cozy spot feels like a second home, where everyone is welcome and treated like family.   The Roosevelt is great for many reasons, and the great food is one of them. Don't miss the tasty pretzels and most of all the grilled cheese!  They also have amazing beers served so cold- it is a feat of science. Seeing tiny frozen beer particles floating in your glass is very peaceful- especially in the summer.   My favorite beer is temporarily unavailable on tap, but I hear it will be making a return soon. Look for Great White Ale, it's tremendous with tones of orange and delightfully crisp.

I have tried the other DIY dog Wash spots and this place cannot be beat.    Great products, customer service and atmosphere. I take a 85 pound dog there at least once a month for a self Wash. I reccomend the ultimate wash- it's so easy to get your best friend so fresh and so clean-clean.   Today there was a minor malfunction with a hose during our wash. The owner asked about it and apologized for the problem and cut the price in half. Now THAT is class and taking care of customers.   In addition- they have a great selection of dog toys you will not find anywhere else. My bff LOVES the sea creature series of dog toys.   Lastly, if you ever want to give yourself A treat and have them wash your pup- they have amazing grooming professionals who know their stuff.

Holy shit is this place awesome. Great unique foods, which are essentially hand held pot pies, wonderful beer selection, and desserts that will knock your socks off. This is truly a unique gem. One thing that shines brightest is the warm, friendly service. It'd be easy to look at the staff and assume you'll be getting shat upon by a hipster tattooed crew, but in reality- they really care about service, and have pride in what they do.  Pro Tip- have the banana dessert, it is insanely good.

So far, this is the nicest dog park I have been to, after trying most of the parks in the metro PHX area. I hear Cosmo dog park is like doggie Disneyland, but I haven't made it out to Gilbert to check.  Chaparral Dog Park is a very nice facility, and it is very well cared for. A tip of the hat to the park staff, who work very hard, and take pride in doing a great job taking care of man's best friends favorite spot. I think that for dogs, this place is the canine version of a coffee shop, where they can hang with their peers, and burn off steam.  There are three dog areas at this park, with one always closed for maintenance. There is an area for 'active' (AKA Big) dogs and one for inactive (that's not what they call it, I just can't remember- sorry) dogs.  The grass is very green, and in great shape. There are lots of things for dogs to do, regardless of if they like to run like maniacs, or just chill and (literally) stop and smell the flowers. For the two-legged customers, there are a few benches, and even shade structures where you can relax.  The grounds are kept very, very nice, and it is rare to see doggie pooh, and what is on the ground is the fault of lazy dog parents- it isn't a reflection of the park or care.  One word of caution, keep an eye out for the occasional aggressive dog. Mostly the patrons here do a good job of self-policing, but at times there are dogs that should NOT be in a dog park environment, and should be at home, plotting to take over the world. With that, sometimes people micromanage their dogs, and stop them from doing doggie behavior. On a recent visit, I saw three clueless pet parents mistakingly stopping their dogs from playing and bumping into each other. To the initiated, the dogs were clearly just playing, with tons of give and take, play bows, etc. Much like kids, sometimes you need to just let them work it out amongst themselves.

The PPM is a great place to purchase local gems from produce to spices, arts to salsa. I'm a fan of progress, and while others bemoan the fact that the place isn't perfect, I am just happy it exists. The feel of the place is really nice, and it's cool bumping into people, seeing old friends, and making new ones.  This is a bike friendly spot, so bring your reusable shopping bags, and hop on your bike (hopefully it's a cruiser). As a bonus tip, sometimes the market has free wine tastings, and in my experiences, the wine reps are lovely and very proud of their wine. Enjoy your time at PPM, spend money that you know will stay in AZ, and enjoy!

I have Cox cable, it's passable. This review is for their marketing, which gets placed on my door daily.  Listen, dipshits. The sign on my house says "NO SOLICITING" which means it is illegal to post bills, ads, flyers, your bullshit marketing, etc. It's such an epic waste of paper, time, and money. STOP. NO ONE sits around and wonders where to get internet service and then one day they go to their door and there is your door hanger and rejoices that now they can get internet.

This is a great spot to grab some quick Asian food made fresh to order. They have many options that will please just about everyone, except that one guy- but he's never happy so who cares, amiright?  Pei Wei has online ordering which is very helpful and easy to use. In addition they have a new points program where you can earn meals based on your purchases there. Easy to use and free Pei Wei is always a good thing.   Run, don't wok to Pei Wei.

This is a great dog park, and the only one I know of in the whole state where your four-legged bff can take a legal swim.  In reading reviews, I was unsure what to expect, but I was pleased when I got there to see most of the concerns raised were exaggerated. For this review, I will focus on the swimming area, because God knows that is what my pooch focused on. There is a huge area to swim in, and beach entry, as well as dock diving area, for the more advanced doggie divers. Watching my pal swim and fetch his tennis ball just made my day, because he had SO much fun he just loved his time spent at Cosmo. After our time there, we walked over to the rinse station, and he got a nice fresh water rinse, just to keep him nice and clean. I l Love that Cosmo dog park added that thoughtful touch, it was really nice and much appreciated.  To address some of the oft repeated concerns you will read about, yes, there is the occasional mound o pooh, but that isn't the dog's fault, or the park's fault, that is lazy human error. Another issue mentioned is that the fenced play area is worn down and needs grass planted. This appears to be true, but that means the park is a victim of it's success. Other dog parks have the luxury of having three areas, with one always being over seeded and rehabbed, here that isn't an option. So lighten up, OCD dog owners, a little dirt will not kill you.  Another concern listed that didn't bother me is that some complain there isn't a fence all the way around the lake. On paper, that is a concern, but when you get there, you see it isn't an issue. Your dog would have to have the worst case of ADHD ever, to not want to stay near you and the water, other dogs, floating tennis balls, etc. etc.  The area where the fence stops is far away, and it is not a problem.   All in all, Cosmo dog park is really an outstanding venue for dog entertainment. Gilbert did an awesome job with it, and there is much to be proud of there. If only I didn't have to drive 25 miles one way to get there, I would practically live there. Enjoy!

This store is surprisingly legit. Fry's has managed to do something that no other chain has. At peaks times, they have an employee directing customers to fast check out lines so you are out in a heartbeat. Do you hear me Safeway? They have more than one lane open! Groundbreaking stuff, I know.  This store has soul, good employees and good products. I routinely save a ton of money, and not just because I am a shoplifter. Just kidding.  Check this place out, it's where the SoSco locals go.

I REALLY want to like this place, which is why I came back on a Sunday. The barista was nice and friendly, that isn't so much the problem. Here are the problems.  1. They have been playing the same terrible song for two hours. No joke. I'm not sure if this is a psych experiment or a cruel joke, but either way- holy @!$%.  2. I must have missed the sign saying, "Burn-outs" welcome & preferred. This is the oddest group of people ever. During the course of my visit, some random guy tried to "save" a really nice man who happens to be blind. Along with that, the man kept yelling to the counter, "Did ya'll forget me?" Answer- yes. He ordered breakfast and bacon 40 minutes earlier. Yikes.  So, I cannot recommend this spot unless you like torture, or you are a psych major and need to study some weirdos. Bring your DSM -IV and have a great time.

Ahhh Costco, my long-lost love. I have to preface this by saying I am a Costco fanatic. I bought my car using Costco car buying, I buy my food there, I purchase pretty much everything imaginable there.  This location is good, and located right off the 101 Freeway in North Scottsdale. Parking is kinda dicey, and I think it's usually hard to find a spot, but if you try a little- you can make it happen. As with other Costcos, the employees are really friendly and seem happy. The products are very good and I even like all their Kirkland branded items, which are very high quality, but at a lower price point. Best of all a Costco, if you are unhappy with a purchase their return policy is second to none. Personally I don't like to return things, not sure why- i'm just loathe to do it.  Anyway, check this spot out, it is a great option regardless if you need a case of TP or a huge cake- Costco has you covered.

This Costco is a departure from the others in town, at least regarding customer service. I was on the hunt for a new iPad 2 Air, and the phx store told  me that Tempe had three in stock. I drove right over there, and went to a register to give them the electronic purchasing slip (you pay and then go to a merchandise cage and pick up your item) and paid. When they gave me the item, it was gold, not silver. On many things, I don't care about color, but an expensive new shiny piece of tech the color needs to be the right color. I think the gold ipad is tacky looking and not for me. I told the manager that I was here to purchase the silver model, and he started arguing with me. I was puzzled because I would have thought I knew more about what I wanted to purchase than a stranger, but he seemed to think otherwise. Anyway, long story short, they didn't have it in stock, and I left, dissapointed at the bad info (not his fault) and suprised at the poor service (his fault.)

Wow, super surprised to see the negative reviews, not sure if they changed things, or if some of the bad reviews are bogus, because my experience was perfect.  My pool pump was making a crazy loud noise, and then just shutting off completely. Like others, I have a home warranty through Old Republic, and I placed a service request. I had previously placed a request for the same problem, and got a different company- which was a nightmare.  As luck would have it, I got an email back from Old republic saying Aaron Pools was going to take care of it. About an hour after getting the email, I got a call from Stephanie, who was super friendly, and helped to get me on the schedule.  The day before my appointment, I got a reminder phone call from her, and again she was very nice and answered all my questions.  Today, Weston showed up to look at the pool pump. He spent time explaining what the probable causes of the failure were, and he began his diagnostics. Weston was super friendly and answered my million and one questions. After just a few minutes, he identified that the motor was cooked. My options were to put in a refurbished one, or for a minor fee get a brand new motor. I opted to get the new motor, and Weston didn't put any pressure either way, in fact he suggested going with the refurb, so I was only out the cost of the copay. Weston installed the brand new pump, and when I fired it up, I have never heard such a quiet pump, and my pool vacuum was swimming around so fast I thought it was on bath salts.  I really appreciated the customer service, support, and professionalism from Weston and Aaron Pools. I would have NO hesitation in recommending them to a friend. In the world of home warranty repair, we know that it's a crapshoot, but it's nice to win once in a while, and with Aaron Pools, you have legit people taking care of your summer survival tool. Thanks Aaron Pools, I appreciate it!  (Footnote. I can't help but point out the majority of the negative reviews are from people with limited or no profiles, or only one or two reviews and no photos. In the Yelp community, these are called "Orange heads" and honestly you need to strongly consider the validity of their reviews. They could just as easily be employees of a competing business. I always put more stock in reviewers with a good history of reviews, and Elite status reviews are usually very legit. Good luck!)

Yelp comes through again.  Just bought a house and needed the locks changed. I never knew you could re-key locks, I always thought you just buy new ones from Lowes, but happily there was an option. When I searched Yelp to see who looked good, one company was miles above the rest. A 1 Minute Key Service was the highest rated. I noticed that many of the reviews were from people with only 1-3 reviews, which in the Yelp world, doesn't always mean they are legit. After meeting Jeff and having work done, what I now realize is that these are people who aren't on Yelp, but liked Jeff so much they joined JUST to do a review about it.  After doing my research I called Jeff to make an appointment. Jeff is the owner and master locksmith, and he answers the phone directly. He answered my numerous questions, and had a very nice, laid back way about him. I made an appointment for him to come out on Saturday, the day after I moved into my new home.  I moved into my home Friday night, and while I was bringing in boxes, the door to the home swung shut as I went back to get more boxes. As I walked back to the door I noticed that the bottom lock was locked. Ugh, annoying- grab my key and unlock it. Oh shit. My key (the ONLY key I got) was on the kitchen counter top, and I was locked outside. I tried every door, and sure enough- I was locked out of my house, on the first night, at 10:30pm. Pretty much I was screwed. Oh yah, also my phone was inside and I had no way to reach anyone, and I don't know about you- but I don't have ANY of my numbers memorized.  I went to my neighbors house (Hi, I just met you, now I am locked out- may I use your phone? Ugh.) and used the phone. I asked my kind neighbor to pull up the number for A 1 Minute Key Service, and I called Jeff. Jeff answered and was so nice, and kind of laughed and said he would be out to help me within 40 minutes. As a new homeowner, I was really worried about how much this was going to cost me, but then again- what choice did I have?  Jeff showed up and was just great. He got me into my home in a matter of minutes, and could not have been nicer. He kept reassuring me that there are much worse things that have happened than what I did, although I felt really dumb.  The most amazing part is the price. Jeff told me, "You know what, I'm already coming out tomorrow- let's call this part of that service." I was BLOWN away by that act of kindness.  The next day Jeff showed up as promised and changed out all the locks. He was professional, fast, and explained everything. I  cannot recommend him enough- he is amazing and it's so cool that someone is so great at his trade. Do yourself a favor, and put his number in your phone- you'll need it eventually.

I need supplies for chronic respiratory issues and heard there was a new company which actually takes care of customers and doesn't treat you like an Inconvienence.  I called to make an appointment and the person was very friendly and helpful. Even though they were busy- they got me an appointment right away.   I met with a respiratory therapist and he was great. Very knowledgable and helpful, and clearly knew knew his stuff.  The RT helped me get set up with my supplies and educated me on all the options.  I've ised other providers before where you are just an annoying number, but at MedOne, they treat you like a valued customer, and they clearly take pride in getting things right, and taking care of business.  Rather than come in once a month- MedOne will Mail me my supplies so it's automatic- which I really appreciate.   Well done MedOne, it's nice to see that great customer service still exists.

I needed to rent tables and chairs for a party, and turned to Yelp to see who are the people in your neighborhood. Andrews stood out from the rest of the pack, and I called them. Evelyn was a peach to work with, couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Evelyn gave me ideas on how to save money and achieve the look I wanted.  The prices were great, and their website has all the prices listed, unlike other places where God only knows what it costs to rent a plastic chair? You can pretty much do all your business online then you get a confirmation.  I highly recommend Andrews Party Rental, and I sincerely hope to find an excuse to rent a cotton candy machine in the near future!

So it was finally time to upgrade to an iPHONE 5S, and I heard that Apple was taking in old iPHONES and would give Apple gift cards in exchange. The only problem was that my old iphone had a huge crack in the back glass. I checked my trusty Yelp, and quickly saw that MacMedia was highly rated, and looked great.  I took my phone in, and spoke with Jake. Jake was super helpful and said he could replace the back glass for $30. I also asked him about the ear speaker, which was clogged up due to an unfortanate Sushi accident. (Don't ask)  Jake said he would take a look at it while he replaced the glass. In no time at all Jake brought me my phone from the back, and the new glass looked better than the original! Jake was also kind enough to clean out the speaker and it looked great. Awesome service and great deal.  I took my newly repaired phone to Apple, and whereas I would have gotten nothing for the cracked screen iphone, I now earned a $101 Apple card! (Keep this in mind if your screen is cracked, as a small investment will more than pay for itself)  Thanks Jake and MacMedia, you guys are legit, and will be my first and only choices for any Apple Emergency Room visits.

Love this theater. Plan on getting there a little earlier, as sometimes parking can be tricky. Purchase a refill cup once a year, and get $1.50 refills all year long. Also when the lines are long to get tickets, step up to the little machines and do your own thing, it's fast and painless.  Keep up the good work Harkins. I am loyal to you thanks to your clean theaters and refill cups and popcorn. It's considerate and appreciated.

My old pool needed an update and after doing a bunch of research I found one of the top builders in the state, Desert Gator.   Erik Showed up at my house promptly as promised and was super friendly and professional. Erik had a ton of great ideas on how to stretch my budget while creating a custom travertine look.  My old pool had a boring (and cracked) cool deck that had all the style and swag of expired tofu. I didn't want to have an updated remodeled pool, with boring cool decking- instead I choose travertine.   Erik helped me finalize a design (travertine coping & patio; with an amazing subway tile pattern for the waterline tile) and work began quickly after.   Erik and his crew showed up as promised and got to work. His crew are true craftsmen- who are diligent, hard working, and professional. They truly care about what they are doing and know that their work will be on display for many decades.   Desert Gator is everything that the other companies are not. When Erik says something is going to happen- it does. When you think you are getting good work, you get superior work. Even little details like cutting custom travertine skimmer lids so that no plastic is showing- and your deck is ALL travertine- these are things that set Erik and Desert Gator apart.   In closing- I cannot recommend Desert Gator highly enough. Outstanding work at fair prices. Their attention to detail is awesome and you won't be disappointed. Doesn't your pool and living space deserve the best? Surround yourself in beauty and have Desert Gator take your dreams and turn them into a reality.    (Pro-tip- when you have people working on your place outdoors, set them up with an ice chest with Gatorade and water. It's a simple way of showing respect and thanking them for their hard work in this godforsaken heat.)

Chompies has the best bagels in AZ. Period.  Most places under cook their bagels, and they are too doughy- like Einstein's.   Chompies bagels are unmatched and very tasty, along with their cream cheese, which comes in a ton of different flavor options.

I grew up a Home Depot guy, but when I moved to the Dale, Lowe's was super close, so I had to try it out. They have this cool thing there, it's called "Customer Service" Here is how it works. If you have a question or need anything, they have friendly employees who will help you and more shockingly- know what they are talking about. It's crazy- right?  I needed to buy a new front loading washer, dryer, and French-door, bottom freezer fridge. I shopped around like a madman, and I researched like crazy- and learned that Samsung got top marks by Consumer Reports in pretty much all areas. I went to Lowe's and discovered they had 10% all appliances over $300. I also had a moving coupon from the USPS for an additional %10 so I got %20 off!! That adds up when you are buying $5,000 worth of appliances. Justin was amazing in the appliance dept. Super helpful and funny- he made the experience really easy. Here are some tips I learned:  -If buying front loaders, spend the extra dough and get the pedestals. I am 6'4 and every time I use my machines- I am grateful for the investment.  -Buy the four year protection plan. Even if you have a home warranty- it's still better to go through Lowe's because there is no service fee.  -Do your homework, shop around. Find out what is going to last a long time, what is highest rated, not just what is flashy and looks cool. For example, Electrolux stuff LOOKS really cool, but when you research it you discover they break down A LOT. I suppose if you're loaded it doesn't matter as you are made of money- but for us commoners, it's nice to buy quality.  Happy shopping!

This great boutique is located in the same building as Giant Coffee, and like Giant, is a good place to spend time & money!  I was looking for some Easter basket filler, and since buying clothes for a woman is tricky at best, I chickened out and went with a gift card, along with a random little ring shaped like a audio tape. The employee (maybe owner?) was super friendly and helped make the gift card look great by wrapping it, and really went above and beyond in being helpful and nice, when this wasn't the biggest sale of the day.  In looking around, Bunky offers a lot of interesting and cool looking items for men and women. I am told that the clothes are similar to what you might find at Anthropologie (that didn't help me, or prob. most guys, but maybe that helps you)  In closing, grab a tasty drink from Giant, then go shop at Bunky. Cool selection, great customer service, and supporting local businesses. Win-win!

How do I love Cost Plus, let me count the ways!  I never used to shop much at Cost Plus, just the occasional rando item. But a whole ago I saw an amazing kitchen table which had four seats bolted underneath the table on a swivel. This engineering masterpiece was made with quality wood and steel and was the perfect combo of industrial and warm. I was told you can go online and place a "watch" on an item to see when the price comes down. Sure enough, a month later it went on sale for $200 off. I was in!  I purchased it online and got an email a few days later to come to the store to pick it up. It couldn't have been easier- I just pulled up in front of the store and the awesome employees loaded it up for me. I tried to tip them but even after three attempts they refused.   Long story long, this place is awesome. Great deals on unique items. Sign up for their rewards program and you get some great coupons via email.

This show is the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life! For frame of reference allow me to give examples of things I have seen that cannot compete with this show:  -Assisted with childbirth -Watched numerous car accidents in progress (three with fire involved) -Seen people tased in real life -Done CPR, brought back a few -Seen bad people arrested and good people saved   The point being, this show is so much cooler than anything I can ever imagine. It was truly mind-blowing. To the cast, please let me say you are all amazing artists. YOU are what makes this show. I hope you read this and share with your peers how much what you do means to us. Seeing your dancing and precision is truly inspiring, especially for those of us with two left feet. The music was incredible, the dancing and performance incredible. It was just wondrous. I only wish I could afford to take everyone I know there, because I can't think of anyone who wouldn't be blown away by your performance. When I win the Powerball this week, I will contact the show and try and get a private performance for me and a  few hundred pals.  Thanks Cirque du Soleil- LOVE. The world is a better place for this show being in existence.

I grew up in the area, and was a fan of Lucky Boy, and then it changed owners, and the quality sucked, so I retired its jersey.  After reading here on Yelp that Lucky Boy was back to its full glory, I had to see for myself. I hit the drive thru on a Thursday afternoon, and the service was quick, friendly, and efficient.   Getting the burger with 1,000 island dressing, and side of fries, I went home. I was very happy to learn that the burgers were better than ever! Tasty burgers, with a nice char taste, and they pay attention to details, which is great. Tasty fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, piled on a grilled bun makes for a great meal.   Lucky Boy v1.0 had kind of weak fries, they were trying to be fresh and simple, but they were bland and tasteless. Lucky Boy v2.0 uses frozen fries, and does a great job of cooking them perfectly.  Just an FYI, the inside of Lucky Boy is very, very small. Cute, but small, so if you have a large group, this may be a better take out spot.  I also had a strawberry malt, which was very tasty.  I look forward to putting Lucky Boy back in the rotation. I think it's really cool to have really good food, locally owned at good prices. I know the 5 Guys Vs. In-N-Out war rages on, but I will stick with Lucky Boy!

I LOVE Costco, and here is why.  Great customer service (which in some places is a lost art), good value, selection and more.  Last night I was looking at allergy meds because my four-legged best friend has allergies (did you know dogs can take Claritan? true story) and I was looking at all the options. I am clueless so I was going to ask a Pharmacist, but I saw they were locking up and walking away. I went up to one, apologized for stopping them when they were clearly off, and asked a question about which medication is best. The employee was so patient and kind, and took time to answer my question when they were off the clock. That was really impressive and meant a lot to me, as my wingdog means the world to me.  Another cool thing about Costco, is that you can sometimes get a secret deal on electronics, and other larger items. I was shopping for a laptop and was told that you can ask a manager if there is an item that is the last one, or demo, and get a s smoking deal. Sure enough, I spoke with a manager, and got $100 a floor model.  You sometimes hear that Costco and Sam's Club are the same. They are, in the same way a Ferrari is the same as a Hyundai.  Keep up the good work Costco, you are a rockstar.

Luke's is a great spot for a hotdog, but what you REALLY need to get here is their famous Italian beef sandwich. This location can be a bit tricky to find, so maybe use the Dunkin Donuts as your landmark, and Luke's is just next door to the North.  Try the fries, they are great, and make sure to add cheese to your sammie, you won't be disappointed.

Found this spot thanks to Yelp.  Went for lunch on a Friday for the first time. Walking in, a great odor of BBQ welcomes you. The decor is pretty down home and relaxed, it's total Mom & Pop, so if you require corporate clutter like TGIF, Applebees, etc. you will be disappointed. I don't go out to eat so I can pretend to be an interior designer, I go for the food, so I don't care about decor, especially when it comes to casual dining.   At Scottsdale BBQ, you order at the counter, and your food is brought to you. I was greeted by a friendly employee who was very warm and knowledgeable about their offerings. The girl recommended the sirloin tri-tip sandwich, which I ordered, along with potato salad.  The food was brought to the table, and my buddy and I dug in. The sandwich was delicious, the meat very tender and flavorful, served on a really good, crispy roll. The BBQ sauce was delicious and hit the spot. The potato salad was good, I think the portion was a little tight, but still good.  Overall, the food was great, but I have to say, for a casual restaurant, the service out shined even the good food. It was so refreshing to go to a casual spot, and be greeted warmly, and have service that really was comfortable and sincere. It's great to see an employee clearly proud of the food they offer, and after eating she checked in to see what we thought of the food. Well done Scottsdale BBQ, I look forward to coming back.

This old-school Basha's reminds me of PHX from years ago. The store IS old, which is part of the charm. You won't find LCD tvs telling you what to buy, you won't find a Starbucks in the store. What you will find, is all the groceries anyone needs, plus a healthy booze selection and best of all, easy parking- which allows for a quick visit.  On tonight's visit, I got all my stuff, checked out quickly and was on my way. In scanning other reviews, I am confused as to why prices were raised as an issue? The prices at this store were the same I see at Safeway, etc. except Basha's offers their discount card. Tonight, I saved $34 simply by entering a phone number in the computer (no, it doesn't need to be your number, or even a real number. I use the movie phone #)  I must admit a bias, I am very PRO small and locally owned business. I would much rather spend money which will stay in AZ, and that is another reason why I choose to spend my money at Basha's and AJ's.  If you're looking for a quick, positive shopping experience- this store will work great. If you require a spa-like aesthetic to conduct your shopping, this will not work out. This store is a throw-back to the old days when you just  needed a good spot to pick up some chow.

As far as cities go, Phoenix is a baby.  Well, this baby is growing up- and learning to walk and run. Now that we have a light rail system, it is easier, cleaner, and more fun to get around. Does it go everywhere we need? Nope, not yet, but every system starts somewhere.  The light rail is very clean and safe, thanks in part to the CCTV security system, and the proactive enforcement that PPD does. If you've ridden the bus, and gotten that creeper vibe, fear not- the light rail does have any of that. With plenty of seats, bike racks and ADA accessible seating, this will get you where you need to be in style.  The Roosevelt Station is great. In addition to plenty of seating and shade, there is a really cool light show setup, and at night the station looks more like a night club, then a place to catch a ride.   If only it were named Fhoenix Area Rapid Transit (FART), it would be amazing. Maybe next time.

Going to the Post Office doesn't usually make one happy, but every time I visit this location- I remember that we have some amazing dedicated Postal Service employees that really work hard to get things where they need to be.  I recently picked up a package there, and was helped by an amazing employee whose name tag reads "Dude". I told him I thought that was cool, and he told me some funny stories.   Anyway, don't be lazy and group all postal employees into a negative group- these guys are gems. Well done Scottsdale & McDowell post office.

Villa La Paws is an amazing place for your four-legged bff.  VLP offers boarding, grooming, pet training and more. I have primarily been a customer of the training dept. and grooming, but I wouldn't hesitate to use the boarding services.  To start with, Wendi is the most amazing dog trainer ever. Wendi has experience training service dogs, search and rescue dogs, and agility/ sporting related stuff. No offense to the big box dog stores where they offer training inside a 50x50 box near isle 5, but I don't want to learn from someone who has a Sally Struthers online training certificate. I need to trust and believe that the person who is teaching me knows her stuff, and Wendi is amazing. So patient, kind and smart, if she cannot help you with a dog issue, you are SOL.  Next, the groomers at VLP are tremendous. They are sweet and really respect and care about the dogs they care for. It's pretty cool to see people who both enjoy what they are doing, AND have pride in their work.   VLP has a very popular boarding program. Unlike other providers, VLP has cage free boarding. Many dogs dislike being confined in a crate, and at VLP, your dog is evaluated and put with like minded dogs. VLP is housed in a former school, and there are different converted classrooms for various types of dogs. If your dog is an old Bassett, they will be put with similar dogs, so rather than fight for their lives everyday while you're on vaca, they can relax and enjoy themselves too. Another cool thing is that every inch of VLP has cameras, and you can log into the net and see your dogs, 24/7. How cool is that?  To recap, you cannot go wrong at VLP. Unless you're a cat, then you won't like it. Otherwise, if you love your four legged family member as much as me, you will be really happy with this gem.

Luci's is a cute marketplace located in the epicenter of what is quickly becoming the hottest area in the 602 for locally owned outstanding businesses.  My first experience with Luci's was after having dinner at The Garage, my pal I and wanted to grab a coffee. We went in at about 9:30, and I was surprised to find two Debbie Downers working the counter. I tried to make a small joke, to see if these were people, or if the zombie uprising was starting, but I am still uncertain.  Grabbed a coffee and cupcake and called it a night. The coffee was good and the cups were pretty cool, they had a built in heat sleeve, so you are wasting less paper. The cupcake was ok, but nothing to start a Facebook fan page over.  Second visit was again after a visit to The Garage (hey, I am a simple creature) this time on a Friday at lunch. Happily, I had a complete different experience, and the staff were downright sweet. There were five people in my group, and I was ordering/paying for us all. After ordering two drips, and a mocha, the girl happily expressed, "Oh, I thought this was going to be a much more difficult order." It was kind of silly and sweet, almost like she meant to think that, and not say it, but her intentions were good, so I just told her we like to keep things simple. Walking over to prepare my coffee, another employee warmly greeted us and asked what we were up to today. It was a nice exchange, and it was great reflection on the place. I will chalk up my first experience to people being tired, I think we've all had days like that and no harm done.

I usually frequent the downtown Lola, but fate had me in the central corridor and I gave it a shot.  This Lola Coffee location is upscale and cozy, much like its sister location in downtown. The business is bright and airy,  with a friendly crowd.  Walking in I was greeted with good music and friendly smiles. I grabbed my drink and muffin and was all set.  Parking is pretty tricky here, and I am unsure what you're supposed to do if you get there and there are no spots. Cry? Perhaps.  My only lament about Lola is that I wish they had more variety regarding pastries/snacky stuff. What they have is good, but kinda dry and plain. I would love to see some simple classics like cheese danish, maybe even a donut, done Lola style. I'm not suggesting that this become a Dunkin Donuts, but there is something to be said for old school treats. There are times that fancy is nice, but sometimes simple beats that out. Like Joe Dirt says, "Don't church it up!"

Dear every other Carne Asada spot in the 602,  It's not you- it's me, not liking you anymore.  Sonora Mesquite Grill is SO flavorful and delicious, it makes me grateful I wasn't chosen to go to heaven for the rapture.  As others have mentioned, the carne asada is the star here. Well, that and the service. To say this place is sweet and the people are charming, is the understatement of the year. This place is owned by a Mother and her son, and both times I have been there, they have been just outstanding.  Today I phoned in a takeout order, and the Mom would answer with 'Yes dear' in the sweetest, non-condescending way ever. She literally exudes warmth, and it is not only in her customer service, but also her food. The carne asada burro is tremendous. It comes with beans and rice in the burro, but I am a purist, and I ask for those items on the side, as I just want to taste carne goodness in the burro. If you order chips and salsa you get a few different salsas, a verde, rojo, and thicker rojo. The salsas are so delicious and tasty- you can taste the freshness and care that goes into it. In fact, the salsas are so amazing, if I ran out of chips- I would dip lucky charms cereal into the salsa, because anything that good you cannot waste!  The restaurant is small, but impeccably clean, and care is taken throughout the establishment to keep guests comfortable. The food is very, very good, and it is so cool to have business owners so proud of their product, and at Sonora Mesquite Grill- they have much to proud of.  Also not to be missed is their fresh made lemonade. I read here on Yelp that it was tasty- and my fellow Yelpers did not let me down. It is very fresh and tasty- without being too sweet.  The only thing I am curious about is that they serve bagged tortilla chips, as opposed to making them fresh. Not the end of the world, just kind of curious. I would recommend if they can't make their own, to consider using the 'My Nanas' chips, or another type which is more consistent with Mexican restaurants. This is just minutia, and doesn't change anything, the place is just that good. Try for yourself, you will not be disappointed. Ciao!

I needed to purchase a birthday gift for my new brother-in-law, who is a Frenchmen, God help us all.  Walking into Smeeks, you really cannot help but smile. (BTW, if Smeeks does not make you happy, you either torture cats, or have dismembered body parts in your freezer.)  The store is warmly lit, and really well thought out. As other reviewers have mentioned, the store is not 100% candy, it's more like 50/50 candy and novelty items. While some may view that as a negative, I thought it was great because you will find such fun items, that cannot be found elsewhere.  In addition to buying some of my beloved Zotz candy, I picked up a cool toast stamper, which you basically press this plastic form onto a piece of bread, then pop it in the toaster. When the bread pops up from the toaster, you have a piece of art, in this case- the Eiffel tower!  It's really just a fun store, with great selection. Because it is a boutique, the prices are higher than you would find at WallyWorld, but that is how things work. You will not be able to find much of the candy anywhere else, so things cost a bit more. Never fear, you can still purchase candy without refinancing your car and home.  Customer service is alive and well at Smeeks. When I went to check out, the employee was super friendly and answered my questions. She even offered to gift wrap Frenchie's gifts, and she did a great job, the gift looked like a movie prop when she was done.  Smeeks will definitely be in my short list for fun gifts, and great candy. It's wonderful to see another small business succeed in the 602. Support local business and have a great time. Well done Smeeks.

What happened to Dunkin Donuts? Holy crappy does this place suck. The donuts are stale and taste weirdly like chemicals. I cannot recommend anything except that you drive five minutes to Bosa Donuts on McDowell. Great donuts, and locally owned. Support local.

Expensive crap food, poor service= no bueno dining experience.   Took my little sis out for dinner for het birthday. Started at The Roosevelt but the place was overun with drunk pub crawlers.   905 is aesthetically pleasing, bright open and warm.  Staff seemed nice, we were greeted right away.   For starters we had chicken and mushroom dumplings. The plate arrived with three anemic little dumplings (think small ravioli) in a light sauce. The dish was ok, but the price- $10, was wildly unrealistic. A reasonable price would have been $4, IMHO.   For entree I got the beef brisket fried rice. Wow. After waiting a looong time the dish arrived and I thought they were kidding. It was mushy and truly tasteless. I don't understand how rice can be so assaulted. It was a disaster. I think after five bites I gave up.   In closing, I truly cannot imagine returning to this place. It looks very nice but wow- the food is so dissapointing I will not be back.

My buddy calls me and tells me his car broke down on the 101. I jump in my car and drive to pick him up. On the way, I thought since it was so hot, I will stop and grab a couple of bottles of water. I see this store, and stop in. As soon as I entered I should have known there was a problem. There was a line nine deep, and people looked like they had been there for a bit. While they had many staff members, they only had one register open. At one point they tried to fire up another register, but it was a shit show, and didn't work, so the customer had to come back to the huge line. It took FOREVER to buy two bottles of water, and I cannot think of a reason to ever stop there again.

Pens are a super cool thing, we all use them daily, regardless of what we do- so why write with a crummy pen? Scottsdale Pen Company sells a huge array of pens, ranging from very affordable, to very pricey- and everything in between.   I was looking for a new Lamy click pen, and heard great things about the Scottsdale Pen Company. I popped over on a Friday afternoon, parking was easy, they are located in the heart of Scottsdale. I was warmly greeted by the owner, Jay- who helped me find exactly what I was looking for. I bought a cool new Lamy pen, that is kind of James Bondish. When you click the pen, the pocked clip retracts, which means you can't put it back in your pocket with the ink exteneded, thus saving your shirts!  I am so exicted to have found this place, I now have a great place to buy gifts for the people I care about in my life. Jay is awesome, and it feels great to buy a wonderful product at a locally owned small business.  Boom.

Lightning may not strike twice, but success has struck the Pool family, as their third business venture is another home run.  Giant Coffee is in a great building located off first street and McDowell. Giant manages to strike a balance between modern/industrial and cozy. Plenty of space with various seating, along with a great big glass garage door which is opened during good weather.  The coffee and snacks are what you would expect from Matt & Ernie, they are well thought out, and delicious. The honey vanilla latte is so tasty, and the pastries pair very nicely with it. One tip, the breakfast burritos take 15 minutes to prepare and heat, so just know if you are trying to get one to go, plan ahead, or they can give you heating instructions. Since this isn't QT, the stuff is a step above, and good things are worth waiting for.  Last but not least, the service at Giant Coffee is, well- Giant! Every time I go to Giant, the service is fast, friendly, and warm. I admit to my locally owned bias, and this coffee shop is great, and another welcome addition to the 602. I really cannot think of  a good reason to pass a locally owned place in favor of a corporate company. I can only imagine what the next Pool venture will be, but if is anything like the other three businesses, Phoenix's future is so bright- it will have to wear shades.

I LOVE this spot!!  As others have mentioned, when I made my first trip to Lola, I didn't know if it was a hipster reunion or a coffee shop. The staff were in a conversation and took a while to acknowledge me.   I gave it another chance and am so glad that I did. I have come to love the place. The coffee is SO tasty, I no longer need ten pumps of flavored sugar to drink it.   The staff are super friendly and warm to the point that you might think they are religious missionaries. I think it is sad and unfortunate that some reviewers are judging the staff based on body art or clothing. Really? It's 2010, chances are good your accountant AND physician have tatts or piercings.   Tonight I took my sister to Lola for dessert and we had a great time. The staff are friendly and warm, and made great suggestions. The barrista even gave us a hot tip on a local concert.   I live in the area and there is no finer spot for coffee. Fair Trade is musty and s-l-o-w. Check out Lola, it's a winner.   Oh yah, they also have great music- it's nice to sit with a great drink and relax.

The Roose is a tremendous adaptive reuse success story! This charming former home has been re-purposed as a lovely little salon and spa, and it is really, really well done.  The owner, and head stylist (not sure if that is a pun, but I just giggled like Beavis) is A.J., a smart, talented young woman who knows more about hair than ten stylists at boutique salons combined. A.J. spent years working at high end salons, learning the best techniques and working hard to make a great name for herself. As others have mentioned, A.J. has won international awards for her consistent outstanding work, and attention to detail.  Like many guys, it took me a while to realize that 'big boy' haircuts do NOT include $9, 15 minutes, and an electric clippers. Luckily, A.J. knows this, and your hair won't even see a clippers until she cleans up your neck line. During my first visit, A.J. spent some time asking me what I wanted, and then matched that with some realistic options (sadly, she could not make me look like Brad Pitt. Technically, that is not her fault- as only Brad Pitt looks like Brad Pitt)  After deciding on what to do, A.J. does a great job of making you comfortable in her cozy establishment, and the whole experience is very relaxing. Watching A.J. cut hair, is similar to watching an amazing chef use her knife- A.J. is fast, efficient, and thorough- each cut being thought out and executed. The Roose features some cool styling products from Italy, I can't remember the name, but it smells good and has lasted a long time, so I have that going for me- which is nice.  I cannot recommend The Roose highly enough. The location is great, the charming building is welcoming, cozy, and warm. A.J. is a tremendous talent, and an all around good person. It is really nice when good things happen to good people, and that is what you get at the Roose, along with a great haircut. As I left The Roose, I got many compliments on my hair, and I look forward to my next appointment at The Roose.

The downtown Pita Jungle has been long in coming, but I am happy to report it was worth the wait.  Popping in for a quick take out order, I was really pleased to see the spacious interior with contemporary yet cozy tables and chairs. This seems like a departure from the other PJ locations, and it really fits the venue. Polished concrete floors and a historic building make a great canvas for this PJ location. It has a noticeably different feel than the Tempe location, and that isn't a bad thing. Bonus points to PJ downtown for providing ample space between tables. If you've been to the Arcadia location then you know how tight seating is, and you essentially need to introduce yourself to the people sitting next to you, as you will be hearing every word of their conversation.  As with other PJ locations, this location is filled with attractive servers, bustling around. When I went to pick up my order, I noticed a few employees were having a bit of a spat, and launching zingers back and forth at each other. Not sure what the issue was, but maybe a better location to fight would be in the back kitchen area?  In closing, this PJ location is off to a great start, as with any new venture, there are things to be worked out. I imagine if they get some front of house leadership in place, things will run more smoothly. In the meantime, it is a reliable place to grab a good meal.

America's is a consistently good place to grab a burro or tacos. Today I called in a take out order. The woman who took my order asked if I was aware that the Melrose Street Fair was taking place, and I totally forgot. The great employee gave me directions to avoid the traffic and road closures. Even better, she told me to call when I got there, and they would run out to my car with my order. What great service! Where else does this happen?  Food wise, the food is good, and chips and salsa are nice. I think the salsa could use  a little work, and could be hotter, with some more zip. Along the same lines, the guacamole seems to be getting a little watered down, and the consistency is more liquidy, almost like they were getting low on avocados, so they diluted it? Not a deal breaker, just different from usual  I totally recommend this spot, and if they can just tweak the salsa so the hot salsa is HOT, and not designed for the Sun City crowd.

Wow. If you like music, you will LOVE the MIM. This place is amazing! Perhaps I should say if you like music OR architecture, you will love the MIM. This is the kind of place that as you walk through, you mutter to yourself, "I can't believe I am in Phoenix!" The MIM now is affiliated with the Smithsonian Museums, and after touring the facility, you will agree that is a perfect partnership.  I don't want to repeat what has already been said on the great reviews, so instead I will just reiterate that you really need at LEAST three hours to see the MIM. That three hours will mean you have not seen everything, but it's a start. The MIM has a really nice cafe with limited hours, but has a coffee shop which is open throughout the day. In addition, there is a gorgeous music venue which you can take a peek at while on your adventure. It looks like a perfect place to catch a show, and much like the rest of the MIM, it is eye candy.  The staff at MIM are very knowledgeable and super friendly. The audio system you wear while on your musical quest is really outstanding. The sound was superior, and makes Bose look like dollar store speakers. Lastly, don't miss the gift store, there are tons of great items there, and I found my Mom a little Mother's day gift. DO NOT MISS seeing John Lenin's piano which he played Imagine on. It will give you goosebumps!   Hope you enjoy your visit.

Buying a house is serious business, and unless you are a drug lord, it will be your most expensive purchase ever. As a first-time homebuyer, I had some serious stress and anxiety about this complicated, scary world. Fortunately for me, my Realtor had already worked with Chris Myers and First Option Lending, so she knew she was placing me in good hands.  From my first phone call with Chris, I was treated like a valued customer, not like the confused, unprepared guy I really was. Chris answered tons of questions, and is truly one of the most 'can-do' people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I set up an appointment with Chris to review my finances, and get the process of securing a loan, etc. Chris was very flexible with appointment scheduling and I met up with him one afternoon at his office in Scottsdale. The office is set in a corporate office building that is really nice, with easy, close parking (AKA you will not die in the summer).  I met up with Chris and he reviewed my credit report, and answered my million and one questions about how all this stuff works. I have to admit, I had a lot of stress about this process, all I have ever heard about is how cumbersome it is, how many moving parts, and how fragile the process is, and that things will be messed up. Clearly those people have never had Chris in their corner, because working with him was the polar opposite of that experience. Chris laid out a clear road map of the process, and described how I could help make it smooth and painless. In addition, Chris had some great suggestions on how I could increase my credit rating, so I could get the best possible rate. With Chris's guidance, I raised my score significantly in a short amount of time, thus helping me secure a great loan. The thing I appreciated most about Chris is his easy going personality, he is so friendly and genuinely a good guy, you can't help but not be stressed.  During the process of getting my loan, Chris kept me informed of where we were at in the process, and what the next steps were. Throughout the whole experience, Chris was remarkably helpful, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable about the world of loans and finance. Even when other parts of the home buying experience got difficult (Home inspection, not great appraisal, etc.) Chris was there to advocate on my behalf and made things go smoothly, that were otherwise a complete train wreck. In talking to other people who recently purchased a home, their loan people didn't do a fraction of the extra work that Chris took on, and as a result their process was much bumpier. On more than one occasion, Chris identified ways to stretch my buying dollar, so I could get the best house, for the best deal. In addition, Chris is very detailed oriented (which I learned that the little details are what can sink a home purchase) and that will benefit you greatly.  To conclude, I cannot recommend Chris and First Option Lending enough. Chris truly provided world-class service, and moved mountains to help me get into my first home, which coincidentally is my dream house. If you are in the market for a loan, do yourself a massive favor, and give Chris a call. You will NOT be disappointed, I guarantee you.

I needed a new dentist because my previous one moved. I wanted a dentist near my home, but since none of my inner circle lives near me, they were no help. Not being sure where to find a new provider, I decided to take a look on my trusty Yelp. I can find great restaurants there, why not a great dentist?  I did a quick search for downtown Phoenix, and one practice name quickly rose to the top. Downtown Phoenix Dental (DPD) had 18 perfect reviews , and I know what you are thinking, "Sure, great reviews- probably spam.." WRONG.  Among the best reviews were people I trust when it comes to honesty and taste. I decided to give DPD a try.  Making an appointment was easy, and Robin was very helpful getting me in quickly. Robin obtained my email address and sent me a link with the electronic forms I would need to fill out prior to arrival. This modern convenience totally replaces the need to get to your appointment 30 minutes early, and figure out the paperwork, especially without the benefit of coffee (you don't drink coffee before going to the dentist, right?).  The online forms are a snap to fill out, and on the day of my appointment I parked in the super convenient underground garage, where they offer free valet parking. A short elevator ride later and I was in the lobby of the building, with DPD right around the corner. When I arrived in the practice, I was warmly greeted and told that all my forms were received, so I didn't need to fill out any paperwork. I was going to grab a seat in the comfy waiting area, but I didn't even need to, as the dental hygienist, Heather, greeted me and told me she was ready for my appointment. (If you're keeping score at home, so far there was no coffee-less paperwork completion, AND I didn't wait one second for my appointment- let alone the typical 30 minutes waiting for no reason)  Heather walked me back to the treatment area and as others have mentioned, she is a great person and is easy to talk to. Heather asked some background questions and began the XRAYS. DPD has very advanced technology, and it really benefits the patients, because it is quicker, and also they get really good images of your choppers. XRAYS done, Heather did a comprehensive teeth cleaning, all the while being so nice and makes it easy to relax. Again, as others have mentioned, you will NOT be lectured or made to feel bad about any tooth care deficiencies. If you need to feel guilty, there is a Catholic church down the street, they can help you feel bad about yourself, but you will not get that from DPD. What you WILL get is outstanding care and some really good tips on ways to be nicer to your teeth, without feeling like you are a dental failure.  Dr. Ben came over and examined the XRAYS and my mouth, and found a few cavities. Dr. Ben explained what he wanted to do, and I scheduled an appointment for a few days.  Sorry for the long review, but this place deserves way more than a few sentences, plus choosing a dentist is important, and you should know what you're getting. I do not like going to the dentist, as I've yet to go to one where they look at your mouth and high-five you and tell you come back in five years. DPD is a game changer for me, as the  whole experience is so relaxing and easy from start to finish.   As I left DPD I was smiling and relaxed, which is unlike any other dental experience I have ever had. I went down to get my car and the Valet looked at my complimentary dental care kit, and asked if I was at the dentist. I told him I was, and that it rocked, and he smiled and said "Yah, I hear that from a lot of people."   Downtown Phoenix Dental is where state-of-the-art technology meets world class service, and I can not recommend it enough. It is really nice to now have a dentist and dental team for life. Check out Downtown Phoenix Dental, and your only regret will be you didn't know about them earlier.

Greetings Yelpers!  Just a quick update, it's been a few years that I have been a patient here, and wanted to make sure everyone knew this place was still the only dental practice you need to know!  Had a checkup and dental cleaning last week, and like always- Downtown Phoenix Dental (DPD) was stress and hassle free! Easy free valet parking in the garage, a quick ride up to ground level and you are at DPD. You are greeted warmly and before you can sit down, you are taken back to the treatment area. DPD has a wonderful aesthetic with plenty of beautiful art. It somehow manages to be open and airy, but also provides a nice level of privacy, so you are comfortable.  This visit I had the best cleaning ever, and the hygienist was Audra, who has amazing skills. Audra was very friendly and highly efficient, she did a very throughout cleaning and I didn't feel a thing! I should admit, I am dental phobic, big time. I used to cringe at the thought at going, and honestly since I started going to DPD, that is all behind me. The care is so good and thoughtful at DPD, truly have no worries. Audra was super cool and had a great way of communicating what she was doing. Just a great job- and easily the best cleaning experience i've ever had.  Dr. Ben is a great dentist and greets you warmly and sincerely. DPD uses the latest in dental technology and that means less time in the chair! Dr. Ben reviewed my xrays and conducted an exam. I must admit, hearing the words "Looking great- see you in six months." is hugely exciting to me, especially since I used to be full of cavities and problems. Since I got into a good pattern with DTD, and regular check-ups, I haven't had any problems, and neither will you. It pays off to take care of your choppers and attend your bi-annual checkups.   Thanks DTD, you guys are awesome, and make a potentially scary visit a complete breeze! If only the rest of the world ran like DPD- things would be pretty sweet. In the meantime for all your dental care needs, do yourself a favor and check this place out.

I've been wanting to check this spot out, but it took me forever to get there. Finally my sis and her husband wanted some food, so off to The Vig Uptown we went.  Prior to heading over there, I checked my trusty Yelp, and liked what I saw. I read that it was in some random former bank, but it was not until we arrived at The Vig, did I realize that it was the bank my Dad used to take me as a kid. Waves of positive nostalgia washed over me, this place used to send balloons to kids in cars at the drive thru, and they had a huge Kachina doll there. Weird how memories take you back.  Anyway, arriving Sunday night at around 7, the sign informed us to seat ourselves, and we found a great booth near the bar. I was curious to see how they would notice new people arrived, and out of no where, a friendly server showed up. Drinks were ordered, and we took in the venue. As others have described, The Vig Uptown, is remarkably cozy, warm, and urban.I have to confess I love when reuse happens to old buildings. Rather than bulldoze a bank, turn it into a restaurant. Well done, Vig.  Drinks arrived, and they were super tasty. My sis doesn't drink (don't judge, every family has a black sheep) but our great server, Michelle, recommended a great drink that didn't contain booze, which my sis loved.  The food was amazing, and we even ordered dessert, which was unreal. A brownie sundae sounds simple, and it is, but the execution was outstanding. It was sooo tasty, I highly recommend it.  My only recommendation would be that they provide a non-valet parking option. I don't know of other places where there isn't an option to park elsewhere, or on your own. Maybe if I had an impressive car, I would be all about it, but I drive an Xterra, which isn't exactly flush, although I pretend it is a Cayanne.  A boy can dream.  Overall, this place is really, really well done. The service, food, and venue are just so well executed, I truly can't wait for the next chance to go there.

The search for the best pies in AZ is over! No longer to do you need to road trip up the 17 to get legit pies.   Pie Snob is a locally owned small business in Arcadia that produces the freshest, tastiest, and highest quality pies in our fair state. I learned about Pie Snob on Yelp (Thanks Wayne!) and had to try it out for a recent dinner party.  I'm not traditionally a pie guy- but Pie Snob is rapidly changing that.  The chocolate cream pie is just perfect. So so delicious! Perfect flavor of chocolate, whipped cream, and an amazing cookie crust.   Do yourself a favor and skip the freezer aisle, pie chains, etc. Order your dessert through Pie Snob and you will be a hero for your dinner guests. Buying local means you are supporting awesome local business owners, the money doesn't get sent to some corporate office in NYC- and best of all you get amazing pie. Not sure how it could get better than that!

Wow, this is a tough one. I first heard of this spot a few weeks ago and have been dying to try it.  Today I decided to take my Mom out for breakfast and we hit The Duce. Getting there early, we had the place to ourselves. As others have mentioned, there is a LOT going on here, it can be a bit tricky to navigate/comprehend what all is going on, but it's very well done.  The Duce is housed in a beautiful old warehouse in downtown, and if you loathe strip malls like I do, you'll find The Duce a welcome change. Concrete floors, old brick, reclaimed wood, it's great.  We were warmly greeted by a friendly woman who explained how things worked and gave us the lay of the land. The staff member told us about the great food and told us to either order at the bar or trailer.  We wandered around, taking it all in and then went to the food service/bar area of the business.  Because we were having drinks with breakfast, we decided to order at the bar. After waiting seven minutes to get someone to come over, an angry looking guy ambled over (picture a chubby Amish guy with terrible prison quality tats)  I say hello to the .bartender and tell him we wanted to order breakfast. He grunts, looks displeased and says that we're supposed to order at the trailer. I inform him that we were told we can order here, and since we want drinks we decided to take care of it all at the bar. Speaking of booze, I ordered two bloody mary's. The bartender made a face that would have made sense if I asked him for a kidney. He looked under the bar and said he would only be able to make ONE bloody mary. Keep in mind we are the FIRST customers on a Sunday morning. I was truly puzzled that they could not have the basic ingredients for a breakfast drink staple, much like how it would be if In-N-Out ran out of hamburger.  I pay for our stuff and he mumbles something that could be Mandarin, or Pig Latin, I was unsure. I asked him to repeat himself and he was able to use his words and tell me to listen for my name to be called  when our food was ready. We found a seat and my Mom was asking what the guy's problem was, and I told her I wondered the same thing. Fellow Yelpers, please know- I am a really laid back guy, I don't get stressed, and can tolerate a lot! That ends when you're treating my Mom poorly, that is NOT okay, especially when we passed over 100 different breakfast spots just to try out The Duce( Matt's Big Breakfast anyone?).  Moving on, sorry this is sooo long, but it was so shocking how shitty the service was, really! The place was really cool, the food was pretty good, and the other employee was SO sweet, but sadly all that was negated by the shat service by the bartender. He truly was a turd. Yikes.  I will be giving this place another shot, and hopefully they find the bartender a personality transplant and/or the right combination of meds so he no longer a prick. If not, they will need to change the name of the place from The Duce, to The Douche.

I just read that Verde is closing tonight, I hope to hell that is just bad info.  I LOVE this place, it is SOOOOO good.   If great food could marry great service, then have a child called great location- this would be it.  Simple, tasty food, with AMAZING tortillas and they have the BEST classic guacamole in town. Very large portion which doesn't try and break the bank. Best of all, they are awesome in not loading up the guac with tomatoes and other fillers, so they can use less avocados (yes Baja Fresh, I am looking right at you)  Pair your meal with a 500ml bottle of Mexican Coke (think Santa, not Scarface) and you have a great meal.  Please let the rumors of Verde closing be terrible lies told my evil people!

Chompies has been around forever, and with good reason. Very good comfort food and the bagels are the best you will find in our fair state.   As you might imagine- the bagels are the star here. I love the sesame and garlic bagels- super good! Don't forget to try their delicious cream cheese!

Short Leash Dogs is amazing, for sure.  The owners could not be sweeter and more friendly, and that is the secret to their success. In addition to buying an amazing product at good value, you get to meet and become part of the extended family with Short Leash. Even on the busiest of days, the SLD crew has time to say hi, chat, and make you feel like you're a good friend visiting their home. On a recent order I messed up what I typically get, and Brad stopped me and asked, "Hey- you usually get a beer hot, do you want something different?" Nope- I just spaced it, and he caught it.  The food is as amazing as the service, and I highly recommend getting a corn pup (with mustard, NEVER ketchup) and an Aiko dog with beer hot, or as I am trying to get it renamed, the Baiko!  Do yourself a favor, and DO NOT miss this amazing little food truck. Every visit I make you will see that Short Leash Dogs is the busiest and most popular, and that is for a good reason. Don't stress if there is a line, the SLD crew does not screw around- and the food is more than worth it.  Keep up the amazing work guys, I hope someday you guys have a brick and mortar location- because I will be the first one in line.

I used to have to drive to BFE to have this food, so when I heard that Dillon's had branched out, I was pretty excited.  Arriving at the spot, I was so happy to see all the work that had happened to overhaul the restaurant. The prior places were kinda Sun City looking, and had sketchy decor and just felt like your creepy Aunt's house.  We asked to be sat in the bar area, and this place has more TVs then BestBuy, but at the same time, they are placed in a way that does not make anyone have a seizure. It's really just the right amount of TVs, and there is something for everyone.  I ordered onion rings for an appetizer, and a pulled pork sandwich with steak fries. The onion rings arrived, and they were SO good, you have to try them. Crispy, sweet, and salty- just perfect. Somehow not greasy at all, they just taste amazing. Lunch arrived, and my sandwich was really good, and the fries were perfect.  Service was another pleasant surprise. There was one server/bartender at the time, and she was everywhere at once, and very detail oriented. Drinks never went empty and plenty of extra sauce, ranch, and other items were refilled often. As we walked out, the manager asked us about lunch and we happily told him how pleased we were. The manager asked us our names, shook our hands, and really was pleased and excited to have happy guests. I learned they do a big business in take out, and large catering kind of orders, which makes me rethink the next family party- why cook, when I can call up Dillon's and have everything taken care of?  Anyway, if you're in the mood for some great food, great service, and fun, cozy atmosphere, check this place out. If you're into sports, I think they have every sport to watch, and UFC.  Cheers.

JoBot is the real deal. Outstanding coffee, crepes and the service is first rate. I went to JoBot on a Thursday night, meeting someone special there. Walking in, there is a long corridor, with a coffee bar and stools lining the length of the bar.  I ordered an iced vanilla latte, and my partner in crime had water and a banana nutella crepe. Our drinks and crepe arrived, and the reviews saying how great everything is, are really accurate. As it slowed down a bit, the amazing employee, Shane, asked us how we were doing, and we told him how great everything was. This spawned a great conversation where we learned a ton about JoBot, and coffee in general. Shane was so cool, and he taught us about the most popular items at JoBot, specifically a toddy. We had never had one, and Shane was nice enough to make a small sample drink for us, and it was unreal. SOOOOOOOO tasty and nice, but not as great as the service and conversation with Shane.  Another super cool thing about JoBot, is that they have late hours EVERY day, so when you need a drink, snack, or tasty crepe, you have a spot to get your fix. Being at JoBot, you can easily have the feeling that you are on vacation somewhere really cool, and this is one of those places that you only wish you had back in your hometown. It sounds weird, but being at JoBot feels like a vacation, it's just relaxing, you're not rushed, and it's very laid back. The great news is, we have JoBot in our backyard, and I can take a mini-vacation anytime, and go there and relax. I am really grateful that we have locally owned gems like this in the 602. I really cannot imagine a situation where I would pick a chain over JoBot, Lola, or Giant Coffee. It's really nice to have a great drink, while supporting local Mom & Pops. That is what I call a win-win. Check out JoBot, you will not be disappointed.

Ahhh, here's to the good life, and here's to Beckett's Table, where the good life happens daily.  I was looking for a great place for a first date/birthday celebration, and I was torn between Rokerij and Hillstone. I contacted Gabi, to ask her what her expert opinion would be, and she was kind enough to recommend Beckett's Table (BT), and put me in touch with the manager to get a good reservation (Gabi-you rock!).  Arriving at BT at 7:30, the reservation was there with no problems, and we were seated at a cozy table off to the side. Our server, Josh, was great and explained the specials and got our drink orders. I had the Palmaire, and it was very, very good. So good, that I started thinking that my car might spend the night in Arcadia, while I cab it home.  For dinner, I had the short ribs, and my date had the green chili stew. Thanks to Yelper recommendations, we added the mac&cheese side dish. All the food was outstanding, and my date was awesome, she was beautiful, smart, and funny (in case you were wondering).  I found the prices very reasonable for the portions, and the quality of the food. I am confused by complaints that it is pricey, it is easily less expensive than Houston's, Rokerij, etc. There is a reason this place has so much buzz, and it is well deserved.   The one thing I would suggest as an improvement, would be to do a little something when people make reservations and note a special event. A good example is Durant's when you make a reservation, they always ask if you're celebrating anything, and if you are, Durant's is kind enough to provide a comped dessert of their choosing. Don't get me wrong, I am not dissing BT, just making a suggestion. If you've been to Durant's and experienced it, it really is a nice, classy touch that keeps everyone coming back.  Hopefully I get a second date with this amazing woman, but if not, we'll always have Beckett's Table, and you can bet I will be back.

The Garage is yet another central Phoenix building reuse success story.  Much like it's neighbor, The Vig Uptown, this outstanding venue had a drastically different former life, in this case a tanning salon.  OK, actually it was a Garage, and I know this not only because of my amazing powers of deduction, but because my parents actually brought their cars here when I was a kid. I have never had the experience of having dinner and drinks at a place that I was last at when there was oil & grease on the floor, and guys in blue overalls running around.  I've had the opportunity to visit The Garage twice so far, once on a Friday for dinner, and once on a Friday for lunch. A great friend of mine lives right down the street, and he has been telling me that we needed to hit up The Garage.  On my first visit, it was very busy so we grabbed a beer and loitered until our table was ready. The service was quick and friendly, the bartender was attentive. We each got a draft beer of something, it was pretty good, but the glass wasn't frozen. (Perhaps it was cold, but after being spoiled by The Roosevelt and their iceberg cold pint glasses, it was a noticeable difference)  Ambiance wise, The Garage is beautiful. I would have never imagined you could take a working mechanics garage and convert it into an upscale sleek neighborhood bar and grill. Unlike corporate ventures, The Garage keeps is simple, and clutter free. That's not to say there isn't character and charm, because the place is really impressive, it's just not overdone. One of the things that will catch your eye is the super cool huge propeller that occupies the East wall of The Garage. In addition, there are little mechanic related items scattered around the restaurant which pay homage to the building's former life. Seating is comfortable and plentiful, and The Garage gets massive points for creating a comfortable seating plan without placing too many tables and cramming people in (Ruth's Chris anyone?).  Our table came ready and we were seated and greeted by a server named Casey. Casey was friendly and knowledgeable and made some helpful recommendations. We each ordered a burger, and they offer several different sides, but being a simple guy, I went with waffle fries.  The food arrived a short time later, and the burger was truly outstanding. Casey came back around to check us, and he was clearly pleased that we enjoyed the food. It really is a cool thing when employees take pride in what they do, and where they work, and The Garage is one of those places.  Apologies for the wordiness of this review, but it really is worthy of praise and attention. Great food meets wonderful service, with the added charm of a tremendous venue. Prices were good and the crowd seemed really nice, with an eclectic mix of patrons.   Great job Garage, I look forward to many visits, every three months, or 3,000 miles- which ever comes first- and unlike regular garages, I will trust you when you say "Try the deviled eggs" and won't think you're selling me a part that isn't broken, or I don't need.

What a charming, welcoming comic book store!  My previous experience with comic book stores was only what I saw on the Big Bang Theory, so I wasn't sure what to expect when I was on my quest to pick up the new Rick & Morty comic books (if you want to laugh your ass off- check out the tv show Rick & Morty)  I called GCCC and checked to see if they had what I was looking for.  I received Prompt, super helpful information and the guy even agreed to hold onto my items so I could pick them up that night, and so they wouldn't be purchased by someone else prior to my arrival.   When I arrived at GCCC it was a weird scene outside. I didn't know this, but the Second Friday in Mesa is super happening, with live music, vendors, you name it. Picture Phx's first Friday's before it got huge and sucked. Parking is either on the street or a huge lot behind the building.  As I parked and walked up to the store. I saw a large crowd of kids in COSplay gear having fun, which I thought was cool for them.   Walking into GCCC you think you could be on a movie set. There are people playing board games, trading comics and cards- arguing what trades are fair, you name it. I honestly had no idea what the hell was happening, but I did know people were happy and joyous- and I knew GCCC was a great spot.    A really nice guy helped me find my comic books and during the time he pulled up my items, teens would come up to him and consult if a trade was good or not, etc. really cool.   I got my items and was told to head to the front of the store where I met Jaime, who rang me up. He explained you can sign up for your favorite items so the day they arrive you can pick them up. Super cool. Well done GCCC, you have a fan for life!

Simply put, this place rocks. The only way it could get better would be for them to open a location in downtown Phoenix.  Amazing food, perfect service, and a great value make this place a home run. I've only been here two times, but was already made to feel like a regular, which is awesome. Perk has great ambiance, is very clean- and the service is wonderful.  In addition to great dine-in food, they have take-out which is fast and accurate.   Keep up the great work Perk, I look forward to many more tasty breakfasts!

This place kicks ass.  The expression "You get what you pay for" comes to mind here. This place is not cheap, but you are also in the most comfortable environment to see a movie ever.   To start with, with the best level of seating, you get free valet parking service. Easy to park, just pull up to the curb and you're on your way. Next you head up the escalator and enter the expansive theater. The hostess greeted us warmly, and since I already ordered and paid for our seats, she directed us to the correct theater.  Long story short, the theater, and all the venue are incredibly upscale and comfortable. Just a really well done place, you feel like you're on vacation.  A few random observations:  - As others have noted, the popcorn is really average to plain. Not sure if that is designed to get you to order something else, but it's weird that the place is so rad, but the popcorn isn't as good as the Target Store snack bar.  - Our seats actually had a partial obstruction. Due to the height of the handrails, you can't see part of the screen (we were on the upper level, far left). I am 6'4, so if I can't see over it, the other 80% of the population must be too. Not sure if that's something they can or will address, but I wouldn't pick the same seats.  -It would be really nice if there were a button that you could hit to request help from the wait staff. AMC has it, and it's a nice touch.  Overall, I highly recommend this place. Very comfy and luxurious and I can't wait to go back.

I was excited to check out Big Earl's (BE's), and finally convinced two co-workers to have lunch with me. We got to BE's around 2:00pm on a Wed, and where was only two other tables occupied. We were greeted promptly and shown to a table  We placed our drink orders, and then put in our lunch request. I ordered pulled pork sammie, my friend ordered a brisket sammie. The food arrived and visually was good looking. We all ordered fries on the side, and they were cooked very nicely. Biting into the sammie, I was really surprised at the lack of flavor. It seemed more like a movie prop, rather then a BBQ sammie. I thought I would doctor it up by adding some sauce which is provided on the table (regular & spicy). The sauce had several problems. First, the consistency was very liquidy and does not have the thickness of traditional BBQ sauce. Sadly, the taste was also absent, and I was really, really puzzled. I switched it up to the spicy sauce, and found that to have the same consistency. I bit into the sammie and was once again really surprised at the lack of bite, flavor, and anything else you would expect.  We ordered the cookie chipwiches dessert to go, and those were good when we had them later. One of my peers said "I wouldn't go back there for dry BBQ, but I would go there for dessert."  I think this may be a case of BE's trying to be touristy friendly, and have food that is safe, and not too much flavor? The place is really cute inside, and they did a great job with the remodel. The staff was nice, and I really want this place to succeed. It is in a great location, and has TONS of promise, but something needs to be reworked here. Until then, my peers and I will have to pass on BE's, but it is worthy of another shot down the road.

I never tried pho before, and a friend wanted to help me expand my horizons.  Got to Rice Paper on a weekday evening, and grabbed a table on the indoor patio area. The place was cute, but it took over five minutes of staring at the bartender (who was chatting with other employees) to ask what the seating situation was. Do I sit anywhere? Hostess seating? Who knows- there's no signage so I guess choose your own adventure.  Found my table and was greeted by a nice server named Dominic. My friend ordered pho, and some other things for the table. The food was good, the prices were fair, and the service was very good. I would come back to this place for sure.

This review is for the bar only. I had a date last week and was looking for a local bar to grab drinks at. I called Cycle on Wednesday and was told they would be open until at least midnight on Friday, and the guy was very nice. Friday arrives, and I take my date there, and when we enter the bar, the bartender makes a gas face and says they are closed for the night. I told her that I called just two days earlier and she just stared at me. No attempt at fixing anything, nada. One drunken patron at the bar yelled to open the bar back up, but I was over it. Well done cycle.

Kerry & Company are tremendous professional organizers, who can do it all! Dependable Divas did a great job of helping me develop organizational systems and basically a bunch of ways to keep things looking great and organized. Kerry is the most can-do person you will ever meet, and she knows her stuff. I understand that Kerry and her business have been tapped to assist TV shows when they need professional organizers to help people who need help in getting organized.  So whether your needs are small or large, Kerry can help you- no job is too small or too big. Guys, Kerry knows her stuff and did an awesome job of helping me develop a great system to store and use power tools, hand tools, and even store small items without losing them. I never would have thought this could be fun or even enjoyable- but it was.  Here is just a sample Protip from Kerry that will make your life easier:  When storing an ice chest, take a kitchen rag and pour some vanilla extract on it, and place it in the empty ice chest before storing it. Even a year later, your ice chest will smell amazing, instead of funky and you risking having people think your real last name is Dahlmer.

My home office just wasn't coming together or working efficiently for me. I knew from earlier experience that Kerry was just tremendous and would be super helpful for getting my office organized.   Kerry arrived and started by asking me my goals and learned about how I use my office. I really appreciated that Kerry doesn't subscribe to a "one size fits all" approach. Kerry treats you like an individual and only wants to help develop increased organization and better quality of life.   Kerry did an amazing job of helping to organize my office and make it extremely efficient. Not only does it look amazing, it works so much better. Kerry had tons of outstanding tips and suggestions and you can tell she takes great pride in being a consummate professional.  Kerry is a whirlwind of activity and in addition to getting you organized, she also does a great job of explaining her methodology and how/why things work.   In closing- everyone can be more organized. Do yourself a favor and contact Dependable Divas and see how efficient and organized you can be. Kerry is truly "Next level" and will help you achieve your zen!

Having been to numerous other gun stores throughout the valley, I have a good barometer of how things go. Historically, gun store employees are too cool for school, and treat customers like a necessary annoyance, rather than the purpose of their existence. A friend of mine told me about Merchant Firearms, and raved about the selection, price, and service- so I checked it out.  I was looking for a Mother's Day present for my Mom (yah, she's cool like that) and was looking for a particular little gun. I went to Merchant Firearms, and sure enough-they had the gun. Not only did they have the gun, but the price was awesome. That was enough for me to be happy, but the I was pleasantly shocked to see that the employees were genuinely nice, and didn't treat customers like they were shitheads (if you've been to the other places, you KNOW what I mean..)  A cool guy named Simon helped me with the gun, and answered a ton of questions. When I selected the gun, Simon then had me input my info into a PC, so I could do all the paperwork electronically- which I thought was super cool, and fast. While Simon was working on his part of that, another great employee (sorry I didn't catch his name) was showing me some of the super cool long guns, and other James Bond stuff they carry. Even though I was buying an inexpensive little pea shooter, the guys treated me like I was family- and were just super nice and engaging.   I ended up picking up a couple other things I was shopping for, and I was shocked at the low, reasonable price. One of the accessories was $18 at Merchant Firearms, but literally $50-60 everywhere else. When I expressed my surprise and appreciation to Simon, he explained, "We want the prices to be fair- no one wants to walk away feeling like they got screwed." (unless you're at a bunny ranch- he is right).  Check out Merchant Firearms, and if you're like me- you will be a customer for life. This place has everything, accept a shitty attitude towards customers. I look forward to purchasing some more fun stuff over the years, and I will only shop at Merchant Firearms.

This pizza is ok if you're super hungry, but if you have the time and energy to get better pizza, I would recommend it. I remember eating this and being really underwhelmed, but it wasn't the end of the world. If you want cheap decent pizza, go to Hungry Howie's on Hayden & Thomas.

Simply put, this place rocks. CleanFreak has a TON of vacuums, a debugging station, and a fast, very efficient car wash. Best of all, for a mere $17 you can have UNLIMITED car washes. If you have windows, you have probably noticed that it is monsoon season, and monsoons hate clean cars as much as terrorists hate freedom. While I cannot explain why we call monsoons 'haboobs' I can tell you CleanFreak is a great place to wash your car.  CleanFreak has some perks I have never seen at other self car washes. For starters, the employees are outstanding. Somehow they are smiling and seem happy- even in the hot summer heat. They great you and explain how things work, and you get an armor all towel, to clean your interior. As you pull around and queue up for a wash, you are then given your choice of air freshener! Where else does that happen at this price?  I highly recommend checking out the unlimited wash VIP fast pass. There is actually a separate line for people with the fast pass, and how it works is a bar-code sticker is placed on your windshield, and you pull up to the fast pass line, and it scans your pass- and you're in- just like that. This  saves time, and waiting in line, which is good stuff.  The one thing CleanFreak can do a bit better, is communicating how things are supposed to go. On my second visit, I was getting ready to start through the wash, and I asked an employee for an air freshener. He asked me where my receipt was, and I didn't know what he meant. I asked him what receipt and he told me that if you have a Fastpass, you need to bring the recipt that the machine spits out. I had no idea about that, and explained that to him, and he was cool I think it would save some headaches to either have some more signage, or give people a flyer with an overview of what/how to do things. Otherwise, CleanFreak will take care of you, and for the price of one wash somewhere else, you will have a month of unlimited washes.  Bring it on monsoons!

Yelp comes through yet again!  I needed to find a place to install watch batteries, and Gemtime was the highest rated in Scottsdale, by a mile!  I brought four watches into Gemtime, and met John, who along with his Dad, own Gemtime. John was super friendly and knowledgeable, and got my watches dialed in  super quickly. While I was there I learned a great deal about watches, and the intricacy that goes into wristwatches. Thanks to Gemtime, I now have a place that can deal with battery replacement, but more importantly- major repairs.  In addition to having the batteries replaced, John is fixing two of my watches that have broken crowns, and do not work any longer. I was quoted a very fair prices, and it will be cool to have these two watches back.  So skip the mall kiosks and meet these watch pros. With over 40 years experience, John and his Dad will have your watch up and running in no time.

This place has good pizza, very nice comfortable atmosphere and great customer service. I went to lunch with some co-workers and had a large pepperoni and hot wings. The wings weren't anything to write home about, but what can you do? The pie had good ingredients and tasted great. I will be back.

This place is really cool. Good coffee, the staff was nice, and my coffee cake was good. It's super cool that they also have a handful of beers on tap, one of them, Mr. Pineapple, had me drooling- it looked so good.  The ambiance is really cool and comfortable and looks like a great place to sit and chill. It would be cool if they had a few more baked goods for morning grab and goes, but there is only so much space.  Cartel is yet another great reason to support local coffee, skip the chains- and enjoy.

This was strangely painless. You can check wait times online and see what you're in store for. The listed wait time was 14 minutes and I think I only really waited for 8 minutes.   The employees are friendly, fast and efficient- which can't be easy because it's got to be a hard job.   All in all- it was a very nice surprise. The test was quick and very nice service. Well done!

The Sweetness is a new small ice cream shop located in the Fair Trade Cafe. It is a great little spot to grab some delicious ice cream. With amazing extended hours and service that puts Nordstrom's to shame- this is a win every time.  I recommend getting the fresh waffle to accompany your ice cream. They are made to order, so have a little patience- as good things come to those who wait.  I think the owner's name is Jesse, and he is a great guy. He is proud of his product, as he should be. I love that he makes great ice cream, but at the same time keeps it simple. You won't find a bunch of mixins, as this ice cream stands on its own.  Keep up the good work, Sweetness!

I needed some work done on my work car, and I was told to go to Chapman Ford. Initially there was some confusion, but once service advisor Tina got involved, red tape started disappearing. Tina got all the stuff ordered and handled, and in now time at all the repair was made and I was on my way. I really appreciated how down to earth and helpful she, and the other Chapman Ford people were. Their great service is the exact opposite of what we often hear about dealerships. Well done.

I stopped by this location at 11:30 on a Friday, before the lunch hour- or so I thought... This place was PACKED full of customers in line. The line was concert waiting long, really. As I was looking around to decide to stay or go, I noticed they were fully staffed, and the line was, well- moving. Upon closer inspection, it was moving very well. To help expedite the line, an employee came out from the counter and asked if anyone was ordering a hot sub, and he began taking those orders, and getting them started, which thinned the line quite a bit.  When I got to the counter, I was greeted warmly. I placed my order, picked my toppings and went to pay. Each employee was very nice, and the cashier and I were even joking back and forth, and it was really nice. It wasn't forced corporate speak, they were just nice and seemed excited about their product.  The sammie was very good, and while not as good as a Mom & Pop deli, it was good and the bread actually appeared as though it had seen an oven. The meat is sliced fresh (cannot understand why people eat at Subway, where it just sits, pre-sliced, for days). The veggies and condiments are fresh and plentiful.  Tips for success: -Carpool. This parking lot is very tight- no joke. -While  in line, check out the menu. It's silly to wait five minutes to order, and THEN look at the big menu and go 'Uhhh, uhhh, I think I want........ uhh......." -"Mike's Way" is basically most of the toppings, there are signs that explain it -Call ahead or email your order, saves time  Enjoy!

This is a nice little local spot. Friendly employees, and some good food. When looking for a lunch spot, I think it's important to find a place that is a locally owned small business. Pesto Prima is that place, and offers really tasty sandwiches and salads that are made to order.  I cannot think of one reason to choose Subway or any chain, over a locally owned business like Pesto Prima. Instead of meat that has been sitting around for days at Subway, here you get artisan croissants, fresh meats and cheeses, and crisp garden veggies.   Next time you want to treat your taste buds, check out Pesto Prima- you won't be disappointed.

Wow- this place is the real deal!   Using my trusty Yelp search, I looked for the highest rated tint shop in Maricopa County. Cactus Tint was far and away the highest rated, by many trusted people. I emailed Rick (the owner) a week ago on a Sunday, and within an hour I received a reply, answering one of my numerous questions. I don't expect to hear back on a weekend, but it was a very nice touch.  I just bought a brand new car, and I wanted to protect it and have it looking sharp. I learned about a product called "Clear Bra" which sadly has nothing to do with underwear. This product is applied over your front bumpers, fenders, and partial hood. Basically this clear modern product replaces the old creepy leather bras- designed to protect your sled from rocks and the evil chips that hit your car and destroy your paint. Because I bought a dark blue truck, I was concerned that the rocks and crap that fly through the air on the freeway would have my new car looking bad in a week. Of course things are always going to happen- but you can still do what you can to protect your huge investment.   Here's a short video showing you what this product can do.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJaTGoDIQtU&feature=plcp  I took my truck in to get tinted and have the Clear Bra installed. I met with Rick to go over what I thought I wanted. Rick did an awesome job of translating what I was asking for, to what I really wanted. Rick showed me the different products and spent a lot of time making sure that what I was asking for would meet my needs. Unlike other places, Rick didn't try any upsell crap- he was great! Rick also helped me stretch my dollar farther, and I was able to tint my glass sunroof.  When I went back to pick up my truck, it was immaculate. Matt and crew did an amazing job installing the tint and Clear Bra, you can't see it, except for a certain angle. The glass looked amazing with the addition of the SunTek tint material. It's amazing that you can be driving and you don't feel the heat of the sun from the glass. It's like I am driving in a nice safe cocoon, free of sun, paint chipping, and harmful UV rays.  If you need your home or auto tinted, don't go anywhere but Cactus Tint. Rick and his team are amazing and provide amazing customer service. Keep in mind Cactus Tint does multi-million dollar cars, and they use as much TLC in tinting a Toyota truck. That says it all to me. There are times when  you don't want to go cheap on something. Body armor, parachutes, attorneys, and Car Tint. If you buy a new car, I HIGHLY recommend that you check out the Clear Bra, it will protect your investment and have your car looking good, years down the line. Rick and his team are consummate professionals and take a great deal of pride in doing precise work. You can tell as soon as you walk in, they are professionals and crisp. The shop is immaculate both front and back of house. If you get to go back into the working area of the business, you will see a work space cleaner than any restaurant, and as clean as a surgical operating suite.  I will never go anywhere else for tint or paint protection services. Cactus Tint was tremendous in every way. Thanks guys!

Finally a great Scottsdale breakfast eatery. I have tried the other places, and never got the hype on the other spots. Dottie's is the real deal. Unlike many other spots, where one item is the star, and other things are passable to downright lame, Dottie's nails it all. Every aspect on your plate is the most important one, and they really pay attention to details.  My friend and I grabbed breakfast there, and it was delicious. The server, Choloe, was funny, efficient, and friendly. Our coffee and juices were filled and she was everywhere at once, without being obtrusive. I really enjoyed my breakfast, which was a ton of high quality food, and a good price. I will be back for more, and look forward to lunch there as well. Dottie's is True Blue in my book for sure!

Some people think wonder bread is bread. God help these people, and their sad taste buds.   For those of us who appreciate premium artisan breads- this place is for you. If you have ever wondered where high-end restaurants and top resorts get their bread- wonder no longer.   Mediterra bread is amazing. Baked with the finest ingredients which are actual ingredients- not chemicals and sketchy stuff.  The rolls are amazing and taste great.  They have a huge variety of bread and rolls and they are the perfect compliment to a great meal.   Last but not least, the customer service is second to none. I really appreciated the outstanding customer service I got when I was learning about their products and ordering things. Really great people. So if you're in the market for some epic bread- this is the spot!

Move over Bosa, there's a new champ in town!  This place is super good, and the one area where they crush Bosa, is in customer service. Bosa is nice, don't get me wrong, but Golden has the friendliest, warmest staff around. The donuts are close to Bosa, but just edge it out by a hair. It is very safe to say if you like Bosa, you will love Golden. It's great that the valley has so many non-chain options, and I encourage you to skip Dunkin, and the corporate crap, and support locally owned spots.  This is where something funny and witty would go, but I got nothing. So maybe think of a good joke during this time. Ready, go: ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  Ha ha! That was a good one! Now go get some donuts!

Wag N' Wash is just amazing. I was a fan of the PHX location forever, and when I moved to the Dale, and then they opened a location down the street- it was a pretty great day!  If you've never been, allow me to paint a picture. They have EVERYTHING for Dogs & Cats. The big draw here is a self-wash dog wash area, where they have all the cool things you need to wash your four-legged BFF without breaking your back, or clogging your tub. Simply choose your wash level (there are three, I recommend the Ultimate, because the soap is mixed with the water and all you have to do is spray on your pup, you don't need to agitate it in) and grab an apron, and you are set. The tubs are great, awesome water pressure, and dogs really like it. While you're washing your messy mutt, relaxing music is playing and the people are so nice there. I know it sounds crazy- but it's actually really fun to wash your dog there!  After Fido is clean- if he was good then pick out a toy! They have stuff at WNW that I guarantee you've never seen before.  Some of the toys cost a few bucks more, but you get what you pay for, and my guy still has a great lobster toy I bought FIVE years ago. Booyah!  WNW also has a great dog bakery where you can get treats for your pup. My dog loves the "Pupcakes" which are cupcakes for dogs. They look so good, I had a friend almost not believe me they are for dogs.  Lastly, this place is brand new, and in immaculate condition. The staff is very nice and welcoming, and the place just has a great vibe. For the times you don't feel like washing your dog- WNW offers full professional grooming at very competitive rates- your pup will be ready for doggie prom when they are done.  There is no need to shop at a chain, when you can shop at this charming, locally owned business. Enjoy!

Costco gas is super rad. Very clean, smoking good prices, and they have very freindly employees there. There is a man I always see who is very kind, and always checks in on all the customers, saying hi to everyone.  I really like Costco gas, the quality is super great, and the prices are always lowest in town. Just a reminder, you have to have a Costco card to purchase gas there.

I was excited to have my tile floors professionally cleaned, and one company stood WAY out, and I was excited to try "I Clean Carpets". Scheduling with Rob was fast and easy, and you couldn't ask for a better communicator. Rob does a great job of giving you an idea of arrival time, and even will update you with a text or call on actual arrival time.  Once Rob gets to your location, he is a whirlwind of activity. He quickly gets his gear set up and explains the process. Rob's attention to detail was outstanding, and you can tell he is a consummate professional. I never knew 'wall bumpers' existed, but Rob placed them throughout the house, so that when the tubing from the cleaner was moved, it didn't imprint anything on the walls. Pretty cool, right?  Rob got my floors so clean, I almost don't want to let anyone walk in the house. My dog is still mad that he has to wear baby socks- but hey- I am not messing up these floors!  In short, you cannot go wrong with Rob, and "I Clean Carpet'.

Holy smokes does this place suck.  I was told by someone that is was like Chipolte, only better. THEM is fighting words, so of course I had to check it out.  I dragged two co-workers of mine over there, and I got a carne asada burro, side of chips and guacamole. The service was ok, not too friendly, and didn't try too hard. That's ok, it isn't fine dining. The prices were higher than Chipolte, so maybe the flavors were better?  Getting back to the office we started in on this lunch. The best way to describe it, is space food. They say that in space food doesn't have flavor, so on the bright side, for the cost of lunch it was like being in space. The carne asada had ZERO flavor. The guac had no salt, garlic, nada. Just avacado. So weird? The rice in the burro had no flavor either, I don't know if the food was props for movies, or what?  Skip this place, go a mile down the road for Chipolte, or head just West to America's Tacos.

Great neighborhood spot. I was pleasantly surprised going in the place, it was very upscale and nice inside, without being stuffy. Kind of a lounge feel. Food was pretty good, there were a few hiccups, but they had just opened. I look forward to trying it again, as SoSco needs more great indie spots.  Support small business!

So this place had beer, and it's cool looking, so that's something. Unfortunately it has the same interior sound comfort level as a wood chipping factory. That is to say it's so freaking loud you will not, and cannot have a conversation. Clearly the owners are aware, as there are a handful of acoustic tiles on the ceiling, but they need considerably more.   Service was so so, our server kinda tried but she had way too many tables to be effective. I ordered the pretzel app and I have never seen greasy pretzels until now. Their pretzels are more like mini-baguettes and they are super oily. The app came with a mustard and some kind of warm cheese sauce, allegedly. It was so weird, there was 0.0 flavor in the cheese sauce. None. Nada. Zip. The only thing it had going for it was that it was warm.  Our app came with no napkins or flatware and it took 20 minutes to find someone to bring napkins.   Overall this place is better than a kick in the nuts- but it's not a comfortable place to chill with a cold beer.  It only makes me miss The Roosevelt even more than ever, and for that I tip my 40.

Adios America's.   Not sure what happened here, but I'm guessing they expanded too rapidly and quality control was over looked.   Picked up some food to-go today. Ordered a carne asada burrito and a "trio" which is chips, guac, and salsa.   Getting back to the office, after three bites of the burrito I bit down and something rock hard was in the burrito- so that was fun. Several bites later the same thing happened, and as much as I love my dentist- I'm not in a hurry to see him- so I had to throw away my burrito. Now onto the $7.00 side order of chips (which literally were 80% broken into tiny pieces) and salsa with no flavor profile whatsoever.   I really liked this spot- and hope they can get it together. Quality matters, and that will make or break you.   Why not have an option of chips and Guac like Chipolte? $2.50 and done, instead of $7.00 for flavorless salsa, broken chips- and decent guac.   I wish this place the best- and hope they can do better.

Federal Pizza is incredible. Out of five stars it deserves ten, all day long.  Amazing food, spectacular service, beautiful ambiance.   The pizza here made me completely redo my Phx pizza rankings. This place is just impossible to beat. The cherry on top is that they have call ahead AND drive thru service. You can get world class pizza and beer, without leaving your car. What a world we live in.  Give Federal Pizza a shot, you and your taste-buds will be ecstatic that you did!

This place kicks so much ass, it could be called Bruce Lee.  I was on my mission to find cool Xmas gifts and when I learned my beloved Smeeks had moved here, I knew I needed to see. If you've never been to Smeeks, you are living an incomplete life, and you need to reconsider every choice you've ever made. Smeeks is the coolest little store ever, and an amazing place to find one of a kind random gifts for the people in your world who you really like.  Here is my rundown on the stores I stopped in:  Smeeks- Amazing little candy and novelty store. Super cool kitchen gadgets that you will not find anywhere else. Everyone who got a gift from there was very happy, and everything I gave out, I secretly wish I had for myself.  Whoopie Cakes-  Wow, this 64 square foot tiny store packs a punch! Their product is so tasty and crushes anything like a cupcake I have ever had. SO fresh and delicious, I highly recommend a visit to their little charming store. The ladies there were so sweet and kind, and answered my numerous questions.  Frances & Charlie- A part of the Smeeks empire, this place had fun stuff also, and another great place to buy fun things for the special people in your life.  Tip!  You get two hours of free parking validated at Union, regardless of whether you purchase something or not, that is a good deal.   Support small businesses at this super cool new venture. Even if you just go to window shop, you cannot help but have a great time. Enjoy.

I was pretty sure this was going to be like a glorified Peter Piper, and I am pleased to say I was wrong. Pretty much this place is a chipolte but with pizza. Pick your dough, sauce, and toppings and they cook it up right away.  The staff was super nice and friendly, and they work hard and fast. When I got there, the line was out the door, but they moved through it very quickly so don't get escared.  I recommend this spot if you are in the mood for some good, quick pie.  It's not expensive, and you get a good amount of food. I look forward to returning.

Sit....Stay- you complete me.   I had to try the place out on opening night. My wingman and I got there and there was already a line out the door. We went down the way to grab a beer as our wait time was estimated at two hours.   While waiting outside they handed out water and free apps, cus that's how Short Leash Dogs roll. With legions of SLD fans, it was cool to chat with other people while we waited. After about 2.5 hours my name was called we were seated at the communal table. I must admit, historically I'm not a fan of the concept of sitting next to strangers- but I love SLD so I went with it, and was glad that I did. Before long, you have made new friends and it's fun chatting with people. I strongly recommend just relaxing and enjoying the experience.   I ordered the pig in a blanket, which was so amazing, and comes with mashed potatoes and gravy, with green beans on the side. They have delicious icy beers on tap and my beer was perfect. Brandon was our server and he was polite, charming, and on point.   Sit....Stay is a smash success. The food, ambiance, and people are second to none. It's truly an American Success story. Brad and Kat started Short Leash and worked 7 days a week. Years later their brick and mortar location and it kicks ass.  Well done guys, I look forward to years of having amazing food at your great restaurant.

This place manages to have worse customer service than both the MVD and Walmart, which is pretty impressive.  The lack of customer service coupled with world class apathy- makes me cringe. My experience has truly astonishing and I look forward to finding a different provider, ASAP.  Long story short, I need routine respiratory supplies, and they are supposed to be mailed on a quarterly basis. For some reason in June I didn't get my supplies, but being super busy and working 60-80 hours a week, I didn't have time to call them. Flash forward to Sept (give or take) and I called asking where my items were. I was told that there was a computer glitch and my new address wasn't the one being used for mailing. No problem, things happen- they said they would fix it and send over what I needed.  Fast forward to October, and I still don't have the stuff. I continue to make do with my old stuff, and then remember to call Valley Respiratory and ask what's up. The person there was nice and said that she didn't know why I didn't get my order, it was never shipped- but she would send it out. I never got that shipment either, but with the busy holidays I didn't get a chance to call until Nov/Dec. I again spoke with an employee who said she would mail it out, and also let me know that in Jan I would start receiving my stuff three months worth at a time. I never received anything until the end of Dec, when I got the three months supply that is for Jan-March. I have no idea what happened from June-Dec, but eight months passed without supplies, and all the while my insurance company was being billed, and they paid for supplies I never received.  I called today and spoke with a nice RT, who put me on hold, and a new person, whom I presume was a supervisor spoke with me. This person was very condescending and essentially shit all over me. It's worth noting that I am very laid back and I don't get upset or yell, or any other douchey behavior. I can't help but see that people who tantrum get more when they encounter these situations, but that's not me, so I tried to explain what happened and asked her to mail me my supplies, that were still missing since June. This woman was clearly annoyed and said that I should have called them and told them about the problem. I reminded her that I had called several times since June, and was still waiting. The woman told me that "normal people" call sooner, and that I had a month from the time they were supposed to ship it, to call and advise them that I never got the package. I am unsure how I am supposed to know when they are sending me things, when  they are eight months late in sending me my last supplies. Perhaps I should employ a psychic? I asked her how they could bill my insurance for things that I never receive, and she essentially said that they don't know I didn't receive them. So now I am a liar too, which is nice.    All in all, I don't think you should have to micro-manage a company who is supposed to have their act together. Mistakes will happen, and that's ok, but when a mistake does happen, don't treat your customers like shit, and tell them that they are doing it all wrong. The bigger issue is that when I am telling them I never received the shipment, I am told that it must have been stolen. I told her that since I hadn't received my supplies in 8 months, a more likely scenario is that they never sent it, but she said that it had been sent. So miraculously, all my Amazon.com packages were safe from the roving thieves pillaging my neighborhood, but a small, light box from them was stolen? Uhh, ok- that makes sense.  To recap, it's forgivable to mess up shipping something, but it is unforgivable to treat a customer so poorly, and to bill for items that were never shipped or received. I highly recommend you go elsewhere, save yourself headaches, time, and energy.

I was super excited to try this place out, as I heard it was a unique, locally owned spot.   I took two of my friends to Perch for a Monday night dinner and drink fest. We arrived at 6 and were given our choice of inside outside, etc. We picked a table inside the lower portion of the place near the door (Protip to owners- for the love of God, put a spring on your front door so it automatically closes- it spent half the night open and all the AC escaping because people don't know how to close the door).  Things started off well, we were greeted by a super friendly guy with a huge beard. He explained everything and took our drinks and apps orders.   The food was above average for a beer place. The huge problem is that our server (and all staff) disappeared. I felt like an Amber Alert might have been appropriate. It wasn't busy at all, and I saw several female servers hustling around outside, but for some reason the guys working the bar were also responsible for inside guests. At one point after waiting 15 minutes for help, I went up to the bar to order our dinner but our server was too busy restocking fruit and other side work and never saw me. I dejectedly walked back to our table. Eventually another guy came by to check on us, and I asked if we could order dinner and for some reason that seemed to piss him off. The guy seemed genuinely annoyed that we would dare to want to order dinner.   One other random thing is that they charge .50 for a side of ranch dressing. I found that pretty tacky and low rent. Our tab was $84, do we really need to pay .50 for ranch? I get if you are ordering a ton- but for one side? Come on, that's cheap to nickle and dime your customers like that.  I spent over $100 for a simple bar dinner, throw in some ranch.   So overall, Perch has tons of potential, but sadly when your servers flew the coop- and you're abandoned, it's hard to get excited about a place.

Oh Sip, why must you let me down so?  I went to this place four different times, trying beer and coffee and snacks. I'll try to keep this short:  Pros: -Cool aesthetic  -Cool concept  Cons: -Service. Consistently poor here. It's odd. There is no sense of urgency from any employee, and while I like the laid back style, at some point it shouldn't take 10 minutes for an iced coffee to be prepared, with no line ahead of you. On each and every visit, it was just a shit-show of service. On two occasions, and owner was sitting at the bar, either talking to friends, or another time a vendor. As the line grew from one customer, to four, finally the owner got up and started helping his employee, who was clearly in the weeds. Listen, I get that you have to order stuff, and take care of the business side, but if you ignore the paying customers who are right there- then soon you won't have a need for vendors. I say that with all due respect, and I hope the advice is heeded.  -Products, so the iced vanilla latte (three of them) never had any vanilla flavor that I could detect. All three occasions I couldn't detect any vanilla, and while I don't need to be clubbed over the head with flavor- a hint would be nice. I had some coffee cake which was super dry, to the extent that it should be served with a red flag warning. I tried to order pizza one time, but then saw the person in back lean into a freezer to pull some component out to heat and serve. I quickly cancelled that order- if you can't do fresh- don't bother.  In closing- I want this place to succeed- the Dale needs indie places, but they MUST start paying attention to detail. If they don't do that, and get a sense of urgency- this place will close, and all their hard work will be for nada.

Wow- Treewise is amazing in every way! I'm so glad I found Howard & Co. on Yelp!  I have a very tall palm tree in the front yard and a small palm tree in the back, by a pool. Both had been ignored for a few years- and looked like it as well. When these palm trees get overgrown- they look like crap and send a bad message about your house.   I sent pics to Howard and got a quote from him right away. His quote was very reasonable, especially since they were overgrown. TreeWise scheduled a few days later, and did the work while I was away. Returning home and seeing the trees I was blown away by the work! The trees looked incredible and the area below was immaculate. Howard & TreeWise not only did a top notch job on the tree trimming- their attention to detail on the cleanup was way above and beyond.   To summarize- for all your tree care needs- call Howard & TreeWise. Don't put your home at risk by using some random fly-by-night company, or day labor company who aren't trained, licensed, or insured. You and your trees deserve better.   Thanks TreeWise!!

This place is amazing like the other two locations- but the Scottsdale Cornish is special, because it's located in what was two older homes.

The Henry is the perfect restaurant.   I was blown away by every aspect of The Henry. It's so beautiful inside, every detail is perfect and it's so spacious I could not get over it. Fox group could have added an additional 50 tables, but instead they left it open and it's just perfect in every way.   The food was exceptional from start to finish. I won't bore you with the details but it was all amazing.  In one visit- I had to reorganize my list of favorite restaurants, with The Henry at the number one spot, it is incredible in every way.   I look forward to many figure visits here. Amazing job everyone!

Inexcusable slow takeout service, time and time again.   It is insane that it could take 40 minutes to get a burrito and quesadilla. Keep in mind all three times I was there it was 7:30pm or later, and was slow. There is a serious kitchen issue at this place. 2/3 times the food was very good so I tried to overlook how gotdamned slow the place is, but tonight was slow and poor quality- and like my boys Hall & Oates- I can't go for that.   If the owners don't invest a little time and attention to this place- soon it will be known as the place that used to be phx burrito house. Pull it together and do it quickly. I want them to succeed but life is too short for a 40 minute burrito.

Heard about a new spot on Arizona Ave, and had to try it.  Walking into Pizza on 87th, you are struck by two things. First, it is immaculately clean. The place shines. The second thing is that you SMELL amazing food. Think about it, when you walk into a huge pizza chain, you don't smell anything. At Pizza on 87th your nose is met with the great scents of garlic, oregano, basil- all floating through the air.  Pizza on 87th has a cool, industrial feel to it, there are pallets turned benches, and it's laid out nicely. Great customer service, the staff are friendly and provide great customer service.  The food is the star here, and the pizza and the deals are tough to beat. I bought a large pizza and order of garlic knots and it was just over $10. It's pretty clear that Pizza on 87th would rather have customers for life, than gouge you and you never return.  The pizza was very good, you could tell these guys know what they are doing, and use great ingredients. Fresh mozzarella, tasty pepperoni, and it is handled with care. One of the owners was telling me that they are working on having a really cozy patio, so large groups (in nice weather) can have their pizza and relax.  Give this place a shot, you won't be disappointed. Pizza on 87th is where classic pizza meets great prices and service.

Hayden Road Animal Hospital is a great new one-stop pet health facility. Don't let the word 'Hospital' make you think that your animal has to be in bad shape to be seen. Rather it means that this place can take care of just about any problem. Drs. Svoboda (Father & Son) are tremendous Docs that look out for for pets like they are their own! Unlike 99% of other veterinary practices. These professionals provide world class care, without trying to upsell you on random garbage.  My dog had allergy issues, and instead of buying super expensive doggie allergy pills, I was told what I could buy at Costco to help my dog with this ongoing issue. Cost? $16 for a year supply. Drs. Svoboda would rather take great care if your four-legged family member for life, then screw you over once, unlike many other shady places.   I give Hayden Road Animal Hospital my highest endorsement! Amazing care, skilled AND kind Doctors and staff, and genuine care and concern make this place my best and only choice. Side note- don't be alarmed if you see police vehicles in the parking lot. Drs. Svoboda take care of numerous valley police agency K9s- which says a great deal about them! If cities can trust their $40,000 crime fighting machines to Hayden Road Animal Hospital-  you better believe we can too!

Rollover Donuts is the latest venture from Brad & Kat of Short Leash Dogs!  Housed in the former Shine Coffee location, they have freshly made donuts and outstanding coffee! The coffee is amazing, and you can get anything you can think of, from a fresh drip, to salted caramel latte.  While the coffee is great, the doughnuts are the stars of the show.  Try the chocolate chip cookie dough doughnut- it will knock your socks off- so wear two pairs! I also tried the chocolate iced with walnuts, and it was sooooo good.  These doughnuts are brioche based, so they are different than old school cake donuts, but in a really good way, much like fancy wood fired pizza is different than more pedestrian types of pizza.  As with the other Short Leash ventures, Rollover Doughnuts has an outstanding since of community. It's really cool to be in the sixth biggest city in the country, and it feels like a small town. Brad, Kat, & Co. go out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable, and its a very nice touch.  Long live Rollover Doughnuts, another great reason why Phoenix is a great place to be.

Sorry Colorado- the best Snooze location is in Tempe!  I've been to four different locations, including Denver- and the Tempe location crushes all the rest. The building is just beautiful- a ton of thought and money went into making such a comfortable, bright, and airy restaurant. We all know mornings can be rough- so why not have breakfast at an amazing place?  Snooze Tempe is home to some of the best restaurants professionals I've ever encountered. In the last two visits- Flip & Starchild were amazing servers. Friendly and helpful- and just totally on point. Today I was having s friendly debate with my sister and her friend. They had never had the pineapple upside down pineapple pancake- so I was trying to tell them how epic it was. Starchild helped us settle this debate by bringing out a pineapple pancake which was just delicious.   In closing- this place is wonderful. There WILL be a line on the weekends. Just know that in advance. Craig breakfast spots don't have a line- do if you can't wait for amazing food and greet service- just hit up the nearest Denny's and let your taste buds become depressed. Otherwise check out Tempe Snooze and start your day out in the best possible way.

Holy shitake- this place is amazing!  This is the best cheeseburger I have ever had. I have been to all the usual suspects, including places that are fancy and expensive and purport to have the best burger. Johnny's is just perfect.   I had the double cheeseburger, fries, and strawberry shake. What impressed me the most, is that the attention to detail on all the items. Each ingredient is top-quality and all of the parts combined come together in perfect harmony.    I ordered:  -Strawberry shake= perfection -Crinkle cut fries= perfection -Double cheeseburger= second to none  I really cannot say enough about the food. Just amazing. My meal was $13, which you might think is a little high- until you taste the quality and flavor. It's well worth every penny. They have a Yelp check-in deal for 20% off, but I skipped it- I want this small business to survive and don't want to take from them.   The place is immaculately clean, the staff were super friendly. It's just perfect. I've heard the rave reviews and they were right!   My only request is that they offer Malts in addition to shakes. It would be super simple to just buy some malt powder and charge .75  for it.   If you are a burger enthusiast- run, do not walk to Johnny's! You're taste buds will thank you- and you will have a new bar in which to measure all burgers.

The best pollo & carne asada you will find!    The restaurant is tucked away in a small strip mall located close to Mesa's downtown area. Pollo Picante is immaculately clean and the staff greet you with a smile. There are several platters to choose from but it's pretty simple you pick if you want chicken or steak and pick your sides.    It's worth noting that all the side dishes are amazing and packed full of flavor, you get several different salsas including hot mild and medium along with some fresh guacamole that puts all others to shame. Additionally you get fresh grilled jalapeños, onions and some other vegetables which I didn't eat but it looks like nice. Pollo Picante does a great job with takeout orders & packed everything up very nicely.  In closing, if your taste buds are craving some amazing food at very good prices I highly recommend you visit this restaurant which is locally owned and family run and is a great option for satisfying some cravings.

Tons of potential, but it's not there yet.   Went to this new spot to try the donuts. Cute little spot, very nice employees offer a warm greeting. We bought four donuts to take back to work. Strangely they don't offer regular coffee, just fancier stuff which is nice- but don't forget the basics.   Back at the office I tried the glazed donut. Honestly I think they opened too soon, prior to proper research and development. The donut was very chewy, almost like you took a tube of rolls and baked them, and iced them. I could only take two bites before having to toss it- which is a first since I'm a donut enthusiast.   I have to wonder if they are doing random quality control checks and actually tasting their products? I can't imagine they do- because I'm not sure how you could put out that product to sell. Also the price point just does not compute.  Happy to pay a premium for premium goods, but at this point these donuts aren't even at the level of Fry's grocery stores- which don't have much to brag about either.   If I could make suggestions to the owners: 1. Rework either your dough or cooking process. Something is off and must be addressed (numerous reviews noting the same issue)  2. Offer regular brewed coffee. Go old school, make a big ass container and charge a buck a cup- you'll still make good money on that.   3. Change your price point. Expensive doesn't = good. Good = good. Make a great product, charge a reasonable price- and make tons of money. Just ask the owners of Bosa. They are millionaires by selling great donuts.   Hopefully they can work out the kinks- if not I fear it will be hard to survive. This place has TONS of potential- but needs some serious work. Donuts need to not only look good, but taste good as well.

18|8 is a new salon catered to men. This modern salon is comfortable, sleek, and upscale. While it is a salon for men, it's classy and avoids the pitfalls of having 5,000 TVs, sports memorabilia and other crap that all the other men's salons have.   I've gotten two haircuts from Andrea, and she is outstanding in every way. Super friendly and easy to talk to, Andrea listens to what you want- and helps exceed your expectations. 18|8 strives to make the whole experience relaxing and stress free, and that was my experience 100%.   There are different levels of haircuts, depending on your needs and budget. I choose the executive, because why not?   Your haircut starts by you selecting a tasty complimentary beverage (tons of options  including beer), followed by a brief shoulder and neck massage.  Next is a relaxing shampoo and cut. Following that is another shampoo and hot towel on your face to help you relax.   Andrea was just amazing and gave me the best haircut I've ever had. I have super thick wavy hair and Andrea had a ton of magic tricks to thin it out so it could have a style- which was awesome. Andrea was so awesome and made me feel very relaxed and comfortable.

This place is the crown jewel of the Harkin's empire! What a beautiful spot!  Full bar? Check!  Coffee bar? Check!  Beautiful terrace to enjoy your drink? Check!  While the tickets are $14 it is WELL worth every penny. Treat yo self! This is the most well appointed theater in the state. It's perfect in every way. Best of all, you have a reserved seat!!! Regardless if you get there ten minutes late or 30 min early- that is YOUR seat! Is that worth a few extra bucks? Hell yes! No more rushing and worrying all the good seats will be taken. It's just perfect. Grab a cocktail before your film and just relax.    Support local business and check this place out. Spending money at locally owned businesses means your dollars stay here and we are supporting fellow Arizonans. There is no finer theater in all the land- why go anywhere else?

Very good food and service. The two areas I would encourage them to work on would be:  1.  Attention to detail. In my first two visits so far, both times my burrito was wrong. The first time I asked for no beans, but when I got home I learned there were beans. Today I asked for no beans, add guac. Well the no beans happened but no guac either. These are small things but it's not hard to get right- so I hope they will work on attention to detail.   2.  Guacamole quality. I was very surprised to see such poor quality guac. It had a pudding like consistency and zero flavor. It is such a departure since all the food is flavorful and very good quality. I understand avocados are expensive but you can't serve green applesauce and call it guac. If it's that difficult or expensive I would remove it from the menu.
