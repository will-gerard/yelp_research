No Bueno!!!  This place looks nothing like the photo's on the Ramada Website! The halls smelled like cigarette smoke as did all 3 rooms I looked at. It needs a total remodel. Better yet, bull doze it down and forget about it. Also, it's in an industrial area/commercial area that has a lot of closed business'. The walls are paper thin and the furnishings are old and busted. Keep going up 101 to the next exit. I do have to mention the staff was really nice! They deserve a better facility to work at!!

Wow, I was disappointed. I rolled in for dinner at 7:00 pm looking for a couple slices and a soda. They only had some cheese left and the the slices were really small. I mean like half the size of anybody elses regular slice. The pizza tasted OK, nothing spectacular.

Great service and strong drinks! Visually appealing and just a fun place to hang out. It wasn't super crowded but had a great upbeat feel.

A Tully's is what it is. The same everywhere. The difference at this location is the young lady who is there at 7:00 am. She is great!
