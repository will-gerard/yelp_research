So let me begin by saying the plethora of restaurants in Vegas can be super daunting. There are almost too many to weed through! We decided to grab a bite to eat on a Friday night - wanted something good but not too expensive. Landed here based on its Yelp rating and general price point.   EH.  For starters, the atmosphere is Vegas ... Like you can see the slots from the table so that's neither pro nor con, just note worthy.   The staff was pleasant. Very efficient hostess and super friendly waitress.   The food is what lost me. For starters, I actually had a kinda tough time choosing something to order. The menu kinda has variety but at the same time has a lot of similar items so if you aren't feeling a certain vibe you may find it limiting. Our issue was it sounded good but what we saw on nearby tables didn't look as great as it read. So we started out with Calamari, the man ordered the clam linguine and I ordered some mushroom pizza ... The calamari was pretty good!! Not the best I've had but definitely solid. It came with a spicy sauce that was great! The rest of our meals were very very mediocre. For the restaurant of a household name in cuisine I was very underwhelmed. Nothing was bad ... It was all just EH ... And for a $90 dinner for two in one of the dining capitals of the world I was very unimpressed.  Next trip I won't return here. It isn't bad but who wants "eh" in Vegas?! And it is overpriced for what you get. Go elsewhere.

We came here for a big group lunch during a weekend wedding in AZ. I had super high hopes based on what we had been told and how cute it was upon pulling up, but I was unfortunately not impressed.   The atmosphere is cute for sure. It is an order at the counter sort of place but their branding is nice and it doesn't feel like every other place in AZ. While I do think that's great, it wasn't even close to enough to bring up my review of the food.   The food was not good. And not just mine ... nobody at our whole table particularly enjoyed their meal (and we are talking 10 people eating like 6 different things)? The burgers were under cooked and juicing out bloody burger juice. The veggies on the burgers didn't look or taste fresh. My chicken was super gristly and battered with the blandest batter I've ever had. The ribs were dry and mediocre. Even the kids barely touched theirs? It just wasn't a good experience. I know we sent back two burgers to be cooked longer but with how busy it was and the sorts of issues we were having, the rest wasn't even worth trying to fix.   And the thing that made this all even worse is that this place isn't too cheap? If I want to have a crappy burger or chicken I'll go to McDonald's and spend $5 but just my boyfriend and I paid like $30 something bucks for food that we hated and were literally so hungry we ate another meal at another restaurant about an hour later? You can eat MUCH better for that money.  I will say their garlic fries were ok - definitely the best food on the table (which is kinda sad). And the chocolate shake was DELICIOUS. After trying mine, two other girls at our table ordered some. So I guess if you just want a shake and fries I recommend it but I travel to AZ often and I won't be back to this spot.

The BEST Chicken EVER.   Seriously. And I'm the person that orders fried chicken at a burger place. I love chicken and I can't even explain how badly I miss and crave Cane's since I graduated and left Tempe.   This location is always clean, the staff is so nice, its huge and even on crowded days I've always found somewhere to sit. They get you your food out pretty quickly and its always hot and fresh. I love that they have sweet tea. Their Cane's sauce is awesome. I just love love love this place.   If you don't want chicken, or have a lame-o in your group who doesn't want chicken, then don't come here. They really only sell chicken, but they've definitely perfected the craft and I wish they'd put a location in Utah.

I was recently visiting Tempe and stopped by on a friend's recommendation. This is honestly one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had in AZ, even after attending ASU and living in Tempe for 4 years!   To begin with, the atmosphere is unbeatable. Parking isn't the best but we lucked out with a spot!!The building is huge and one of the only "bar" scenes I've been to in Tempe that isn't cramped, a million degrees and smelly. Not in the slightest. It's decorated industrial chic and has bulb lights strung all over. The space is very large and well-cooled (even on an 85+ degree night) and there are I think 3 bars!? There are ping pong tables and corn hole and a few spots to sit and enjoy your appetizers and drinks. Even a live band came on (and they waited until the final 4 was over to bring them out which I highly appreciated). We waited about 40 min for a table but with the above factors it wasn't bad at all. They text you when your table is ready which I also appreciated vs having to hold on to one of those annoying buzz things. The table we were sat at was very spacious, had super comfy giant chairs and good views of the basketball on TV.   The server was totally hipster but very nice and speedy! Everything on the menu looked awesome and it was hard to choose. We had the pretzel bites as an appetizer ... They were good! I ordered the steak and potatoes for dinner - it was cooked PERFECTLY and was seriously amazing. My boyfriend ordered ribs which he loved and my two friends each got salads that looked awesome. For dessert we got the monkey bread which was perfectly shareable!   I will 100% be returning here for dinner EVERY time I'm in AZ!
