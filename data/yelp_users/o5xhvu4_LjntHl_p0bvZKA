7 months in our new home. Our AC has broken twice in the last month. DR HORTON seems to think that this is a warranty service that can be tended to 3 days out... In the middle of summer... In Arizona... It's well over 100 degrees right now before 9am and it's not getting any cooler. I hope my wife and kids can survive this. You are failing us as a builder. I will continue to spread the word to my friends, family and network. This is completely unacceptable. All of this because of a terrible installation via Chas Roberts in the first place. 4lbs of "excess" freon according to the tech that came out to service it last month when it stopped working. Said they would most likely have to come out and fix it again soon. "Customer service" is non existent. Might as well call it the "I understand you're upset line" Arizona deserves a better air conditioning company than Chas Roberts. Unfortunately for us if we don't wait for Chas and use another company we void our warranty. You are borderline criminals and should be chased out of town.

I was looking around quite a bit and completely set on just buying a suit for my destination wedding. I stopped in at Mr. Formal on a whim to see if they sold suits. They did!!! However after talking with the delightful girl behind the counter I decided it would be better to rent a tux and pay for the extra days rather than buy a suit that I might not be happy with and might go unused. I'm very excited to continue my business with Mr. Formal for my upcoming wedding. I will be writing a follow up post to let everyone know how my experience went. These other reviewers just sound like bad mouthers. This place is classic and classy.

You couldn't pay me to write a bad review on this place. Absolutely wonderful. Stop in for breakfast, have some coffee, try some handmade chocolate, stay for some lunch and try some handmade chocolates. Chef is incredibly talented and his wife is incredibly pleasant. Wish I stopped in more than I do. Follow them on Facebook and get ready to drool over their daily specials. Do yourself a favor and try this place if you haven't.

Matt and the guys run a great shop. A little out of the way for me in west Phoenix but totally worth the drive. Curently vaping their Melon Cholly and am in love with it. May have found the elusive daily vape with their Trippy Skipper blend though. Wow, just wow. Do yourself a favor and check this place out. Whether you are currently a cigarette smoker looking to quit or a veteran vapor looking for good tech and a superb juice bar, you have found your new home.

Insanely good. Love this place so much. Shakes are definitely the main attraction here but the food was epic too. Chicken tacos for days bruh.

This place was tasty. That's the only thing they had going for them. Portions are ridiculously small for the price. Pretty sure I didn't order off of the kids meal... Took 20 minutes to get my order. For $10 I got 2 tacos 1 empenda, a tiny soda that was gone before I got my food and chips and salsa... Oh wait... When I got to work I found out they forgot my chips. What a waste of space. Zero stars if I could.

GK Vapor Pub is THE premiere vape shop in the west valley. (Far west valley)  In a world filled with cookie cutter shops and cookie cutter juice, GK stands alone. With some of our nations finest juices sold exclusively in their shop, GK has something for even the most discerning palate.  They also help anyone with SAFELY rebuilding coils.  If you already know how to SAFELY build your own coils come down for the always wacky and fun game nights.  With some of the best customer service I have experienced in a retail setting, GK Vapor Pub is a must see.  Do yourself a favor and check them out.

Tried this place yesterday with an intense Salad craving. I got the strawberry and sweet potato salad and it was perfection. If my review was based on that alone it would be five stars. The rest of my order is where things got messy. Or rather dry. My wife and sister both ordered wraps and ordered them with the dressing on the side. Now I could understand messing up the order and tossing with dressing I guess but a fast food restaurant that specializes in salads basically serves 2 functions. 1) Make salad. 2) dress salad. Now I would understand if someone ordered a wrap or salad without dressing, I'm sure that's a thing but in this case we did not. It's definitely not the most convenient location unless you live in the neighborhood but I do not so by the time I made it home and noticed it was too late. Alas these wraps were to be enjoyed with store bought generic dressing on an otherwise perfect tornado of fresh veggie goodness. Shame really. I'll probably give it one more shot... Maybe?
