Ordered a dark roast coffee with cream and sugar can't screw that up it was delicious. I also ordered a grilled ham and cheese sandwich which was not grilled it was microwaved at soft bread that is something that my two-year-old grandchild could've made. Very disappointed ordered an apple fritter it was OK I went to the drive through the service was amazing the gentleman helped me with my app and how to apply points I certainly appreciated that.

Melden was amazing! He communicated with me in a prompt manner. Showed up on time. Did 12 locks. And an amazing job. He was negotiable with his price. Which made me even happier.  he also was friendly and very polite and considerate.

Was amazed at service !! Super clean and super accommodating!! I was scrambling to get same-day service..:; my son had missed his 10 AM drop off window at our previous dry cleaners.his uniforms had to be done today so he could pick up tomorrow in time for work. And she told me if I came right away she would have them done by 5 PM today.  thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!!
