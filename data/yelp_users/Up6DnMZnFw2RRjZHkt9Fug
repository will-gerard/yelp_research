This was our second stop for restaurant week.  I wanted to go to a chain restaurant after the experience we had at Noca.  ( i know its sad to say I wanted to visit a chain)  I had a feeling we wouldn't be disappointed.  We had a reservation at 6:30 and arrived a little early so we decided to have a glass of wine in the bar.  We were greeted immediately and our  wine was great!  We were then whisked away to our table.  We had a really friendly server and we ordered our meals right away.  I had the clams with chorizo.  It was delish!  Will had the pork and although it looked to be undercooked it also tasted amazing.    The main entrees we had were the steelhead trout and the flank steak.  Both were awesome.  Then came the dessert.  Will was in an adventurous mood so we ended up having 5 desserts.  Our two favorite by far were the pineapple upside down cake, picture posted soon.  (worth the 20 min wait) and the chocolate souffle cake.    All in all great food and great service!  Would definitely go back for a second visit.

My fiance and I went to Noca tonight for restaurant week.  We were really excited after reading all of the reviews and seeing the awards that they had won.    As we walked into the restaurant there were about 5 servers just standing there looking at us so that was kind of awkward to walk in to.  We were seated immediately.  It wasn't busy but as the night went on it did get alot busier.    Our service was excellent.  I do have some critiques on the food though.  I had the pork pate.  It was good.  First pate that i have ever had so nothing to compare it to.  My fiance had the tomato salad.  The salad plates should be chilled and dont cover the beautiful tomatoes with a pile of  greens!   Our next course was the Hake fish and the pork tenderloin dish.  The presentation of these dishes looked sloppy.  The pork was cut in these strips and it just looked like a teenager put the plate together.  There were these HUGE turnips on the plate that looked like apples.  EW!  At least slice them thin and fan them on the  plate.  who wants to eat a huge chunk of turnip?!  The food did taste ok. The temperature of the food was off.   Nothing to write home about.    Dessert...  My fiance got the tropical dessert and I got the nutella brownie.  The tropical desert was really good.  The nutella brownie not so much.  The tropical one was great!    I really want to like this place so we may go back again.  Maybe they don't put the best items on the restaurant week menu, which I think they should!

Went to Blanco for our 3rd restaurant week meal. Been here before and it's great.  the hostess really was having a bad night and just needed to go home. Not one smile or even a hello. When we walked in just a blank stare. Great! (sarcasm)  Food and service were otherwise really good.   I had the green chile pork enchiladas and I love a good tomatillo sauce. The tres de leche cake was also wonderful!  It's kind of loud place and we got to hear the conversation about blow jobs from the table next to us.

I love singh farms!  You can spend the morning here.  Start out with a fresh juice from the juice bar, wander in the "market" full of fresh produce, grab a bite to eat and wander the paths of the garden.  Every week they make something different to snack on.  There arent 100 vendors trying to sell you things.  It is very relaxing.  I wish i could be there right now :)

Went for dinner tonight and it was awesome!  I took my kids and I probably wouldn't bring them on a busy night but tonight was slow so we were ok. The server was awesome and the food was great!  My 4 year old said that her mac and cheese was " the best in the whole world". And she would be an expert on that!  We had the jalepeno poppers, short ribs, bacon wrapped scallops, salmon, bacon wrapped pork tenderloin and pineapple skewers. Everything was excellent.
