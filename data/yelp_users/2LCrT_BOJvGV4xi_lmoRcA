This review is mostly for the Emergency Room.  I had a bike crash on a Friday at lunch hour.  I rode my bike home, to ditch my computer and work files, and to make sure it was safe.  Took a taxi to Good Sam, and it took almost the entire taxi ride for my insurance to verify I was headed to an ER that is "in Network."  Pretty stresful, but once I walked through the doors, most of that changed.  Sure, there was a lot of painful waiting around in a hallway in a wheelchair.  But, hey, it's an emergency room.  I found the system to be very organized and the employees to be helpful and compassionate.  There were a couple of fails on the doctor's part.  She offered me pain meds, and then forgot to order them.  I had to ask a nurse, and then they arrived quickly.  Doc also forgot to order antibiotics for my road rash, but I received a voice mail shortly after discharge that hooked me up with germ-fighters.   When I was discharged, I indicated I intended to walk to Walgreens, since I live in the neighborhood.  I was referred to the hospital pharmacy, which I expected to soak me.  But it only cost me $14 for 2 kinds of pain meds and stool softener (yes, I said it and no, it hasn't worked yet).  Pharmacy gave me a beeper and I was able to peruse the lovely and overpriced gift shop.  If I was hospitalized, there were many items there that I would appreciate receiving.  Good gift shop.  I was there for approximately 4.5 hours.  I had triage, xrays, and an EKG.  I was admitted immediately, no waiting.  I don't have much experience with ERs, so there you go.  Props to the skinny blond "tech" guy, who entertained me by exchanging restaurant reviews while he irrigated my wound.

Welcome Diner recently reopened with the chef/owners of Old Dixie food truck.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  I've been to Welcome Diner three times in the past two weeks.  I've sampled the lemon ricotta pancakes, the Holy Puerco special and a breakfast biscuit sandwich.  All were delicious, but the Holy Puerco was amazing.  A cheesy grit cake smothered in the most delicious pork I've ever eaten, topped with an egg and house-made pork cracklings, served with flavorful, crunchy potatoes...  I love to sit at the counter.  The crowd is friendly and the WD team is personable and efficient.  There is also plenty of seating outside, as there are only 9 stools at the diner counter.  And since it's in my neighborhood, I can easily walk or bike there.  Food is locally sourced when possible.  I was there yesterday when the guy dropped off the duck eggs.  Most entrees are in the 8-10 dollar range.  They have beer, wine, and limited cocktails.  I highly recommend the Hurricane, with fresh-squeezed juices, light and dark rums, and pomegranate grenadine.  And the new management DOES take credit/debit cards with the square.  You can have your receipt sent to your email or phone number.  I mention this because I saw a couple order who'd never paid with the square before.  Welcome Diner is open for brunch and dinner, but not every day.  I know they close at 3 on Sundays.  They are open Thur. thru Sun.  Oh, and the music is good, too!  Get there and enjoy the patio before the hot weather hits!

Well, I am trying to eat my way through the menu, but they keep adding delicious new dishes, so it's taking a while.  The service at this place cannot be beat.  When you are seated outside, every member of the team will be by to inquire about your experience and see if there's anything more they can do.  When you're seated inside, you are a part of the whole Welcome Diner experience.  I most recently had the smothered pork plate, which was pulled pork with a beer and onion gravy over a bed of jasmine rice, with sides of delicious collard greens and house-made poblano hush puppies.  It was a heaping plate of food for $11.50.  The next night, we returned, at my niece's request, and I had the Port of Call burger.  It was yummy beefy goodness with perfect fries on the side.  So, it's going to take me a while to sample everything the Welcome Diner has to offer, but I go at least weekly and I am dedicated to sampling all the goodness they have to offer.  This place is a gem.  Don't tell anybody.  Oh, yeah...Bike Rack!

Coconut cream grits with collards and tomato sauce.  As vegan as it gets, and so full of flavor!  Had it twice...once on Thursday and again on Saturday.  Ran into 4 friends while I sat at the counter Saturday evening.  This place is the best.

I love the garden.  I go walking here 3-4 nights a week, because I work close by.  I have a couple of spots I love to sit and commune with nature.  I can't tell you, because then I'd have to kill you.  Bunnies, frogs, lizards, quail...love to watch the wildlife.  I keep missing the king snake, who lives near the patio cafe.  I only wish people would realize it's a garden, not a playground or amusement park.  Modulate your voices, please!

I stopped in for a weekday lunch, and Eliana's was busy.  The server said, "I haven't seen you in a long time.  Do you want to see the menu, or do You already know what you want?"  I ordered my usual: dos pupusas con carne.  And flan, for dessert.  I am a sucker for a place that recognizes me.  I don't love everything on Eliana's menu, but I love these things.  The pupusas arrived at my table piping hot.  I use all of the cabbage salad on top of them, and about half of the sauce.  Yummy goodness!  I've tried a few other things on their menu:  fried yucca (interesting) beans and cream for dessert (not so much).  I'll stick with what I know and love.  Plus, Eliana's is right down the street from my office, and the prices can't be beat.  One caveat:  I ordered my lunch to go once, and the packaging left a lot to be desired.  The sauce came in a baggie.

Ugh.  My tip-off should have been the Guy Who Saw Me Reading The Menu and came outside to tell me the food was good.  But I was craving Chinese, I work near the COFCO center, and it was threatening to rain.  I scanned the menu, found Kung Pao chicken, and ordered up.  They told me 5 minutes, and they were accurate.  Price was reasonable.  Waiting area was comfortable and well-decorated.  Food was inedible.   I got the lunch special, which include soup, egg roll, entree and fortune cookie.  I couldn't eat any of it.  The soup (hot and sour) was way too sour.  I felt like I would get acid reflux if I ate it.  I couldn't order the fried rice, because it contains peas (I've learned to ask...childhood trauma).  The rice was clotted together and difficult to eat.  The kung pao chicken contained a suspiciously generous amount of meat...so much so that I questioned whether it was actually chicken.  I watch too many movies.  The egg roll was just gross.  It seemed like the wad of mushy veggies was wrapped in biscuit dough before it was deep-fried.  The fortune cookie was stale, and the fortune was even lame.  I would've done better to get soaking wet and hit up Panda Express.

This place has amazing customer service.  A friend and I stopped by just to browse.  She asked one of the guys a question about the basket on her Electra.  He explained to her in great detail how the basket is supposed to work, and told her to bring her bike by and he'd take a look at it.  (My friend's basket tips whenever she puts something into it.)  We were enroute to her place to pick up her bike and head downtown to ride around, so we stopped back by Slippery Pig after we had her bike on her carrier.  The guy asked us to leave the bike for about 30 minutes, so we went over to Lux and had a hot beverage while we waited.  Less than 30 minutes later, we headed back.  He'd secured her bike with the part her old basket was missing.  She'd asked him about touch-up paint for her bike, because it had fallen off the rack when she first got it.  He'd found her the touch-up paint for her metallic green finish, rubbed out some deep scuffs with solvent, tightened her kickstand, and put air in her tire.  The part she bought cost about $16.  I bought my Electra at another shop in town, but based on the friendly, more-than-expected service at the Slippery Pig, I think I'll bring my bike here for parts and service in the future.  It's closer to my house, and it's right on the light rail.

I am SERIOUSLY ADDICTED to the Greek fries.  I go most weekends and eat at Cyprus Grill before I do my grocery shopping @ Trader Joe's.  Service is low-key, the seating is comfortable, and I can lock my bike at the rack in front of Trader Joe's.   I can always find a table, and they don't rush me.  I read the paper and savor my lemoney, olive oily, feta cheesey Greek fries.  YUM!

In the mood for comfort food...I was disappointed.  The grilled cheese was flimsy, and I couldn't eat the soup.  I forget why.  I thought it was way over-priced for what it was.  I won't be going back there ever again.

I love my doctors.  They are so respectful.  I went in today with serious pain.  My main doctor's partner saw me, as my primary doc was out of town.  She introduced herself, asked me a lot of questions about my symptoms, examined me, and made several recommendations.  Surprisingly, one of them was to see a chiropractor for an evaluation, as the problem seemed to be with the muscles and bones of my ribcage.  Dr. Mansfield prescribed some low-key meds (ibuprofen and a muscle relaxer) and referred me to an awesome chiropractor right next door.  I got the best night's sleep in recent memory, and the pain seems to have decreased some already.  The office staff is courteous and efficient.  I hated to leave my old doctor, who I'd seen for many years, but she moved her office way out to southeast Gilbert.  Mountain View is just a few miles from my office.  I'm glad I made the change.

I feel compelled to write a review.  Several years ago, I had my beloved golden retriever on the basic wellness plan.  After a routine visit, she became very lethargic, and I took her back to the clinic.  They did blood work, determined that she was extremely anemic, and referred me to a real animal clinic in Gilbert.  The referral hospital told me that she'd had a reaction to receiving multiple immunizations.  Several hundred dollars later, she was well enough to come home.  At every visit to Banfield thereafter, I wrote on her paperwork that she could only receive one immunization per visit.  Tallullah died last August.  She had never enjoyed robust health.  I adopted a dog from Arizona Animal Welfare League in October.  He was fully-immunized, and in excellent health.  I made an appointment for him at Banfield, just because it's convenient.  I made them a copy of his immunization record, but forgot to grab it before our appointment.  Although I faxed it to them shortly after his appointment, I later learned that it hadn't been entered into his record.  Given my experience with Tallullah, when I called to schedule Norton's next appointment, I wanted to be very clear about immunizations.  That is when I discovered that his immunization info had not been entered into the Banfield system.  I spent the next few days searching through my files and making multiple calls to the shelter, trying to get a copy of his immunization record.  The day before his appointment, I remembered I'd boarded him for a few days when I went to a conference. I called the facility, and they had his records.  I asked them to fax them to the clinic, which they kindly did.  I received a phone call from the clinic, letting me know they had received the record.  I received a reminder call about my dog's appointment, and they mentioned that they saw he was due for only one immunization.  I felt reassured.  When I took my dog in to the clinic the next morning, the receptionist also noted that My dog was just to receive the one immunization.  I left feeling confident that my instructions would be followed.  When I picked my dog up, several hours later, I was dismayed to find that the doctor had given him a whole slew of immunizations.  And to make matters worse, because my dog had had anesthesia for his teeth cleaning, I could not be sure whether his lethargy was due to the drugs, or a reaction to the immunizations.  The Arcadia clinic has since closed, but I will be using a different vet in the future.  They screwed up once, failing to enter his records into their system.  And then they screwed up again, giving him more immunizations than he needed.  I value my dog's life too much to trust Banfield again.

I visited the Bike Barn on a whim, while I was at a street fair in the neighborhood.  I fell in love with the Electra bike line.  The staff answered my questions without pressuring me at all.  I went home, researched the Electra bikes, and returned a few weeks later to make a purchase.  The service was excellent.  They offer a free tune-up once you break your bike in.  I have had so much fun on my Townie!  One of my friends bought the very same model, but had some problems with it.  The good folks at the Bike Barn took care of the necessary adjustments, and now she's a happy biker, too!  They have a great selection of accessories, and will happily special order items they don't have in stock.  Their turn-around time is great, too.  I recommend them without reservation.

OMG!  I could drink the enchilada sauce and live on the tortillas!  BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT.  Coke AND Pepsi! Genuine.  It's the first place I took my daughter when she returned from France.  Nothing says "Welcome to Arizona" like Carolina's!

First of all, I have to say I checked "Nearby" on Yelp from my friend's house in Mesa, and only 5 restaurants came up, total.  Of course, I filtered by "Open Now" and it was Sunday morning.  Crackers is our default breakfast spot in Mesa, so to Crackers we headed.  I don't even know why I look at the menu, because I always get the "Breakfast 222" (scrambled).  It's 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon or sausage, and two ginormous pancakes.  The service is super-fast, and the portions are huge (as evidenced by the number of obese patrons).  The food is yummy, and they keep your beverages full.  We noticed a sign twirler for Crackers on the corner of Country Club and Iron, and we were a little surprised, because you usually have a brief wait for a table there on Sunday morning.  Today, we were seated right away, and there were several empty tables.  This is NOT typical of Crackers, and potential guests should probably expect a short wait.  Crackers serves breakfast and lunch.  I've had lunch there once or twice.  My friend had the soup, and was not impressed.  I'm not a big salad and sandwiches type person, so I'd pass on lunch there again, but I will always recommend it for breakfast.  If you're vegetarian or vegan, however, you won't find much on the menu to your liking.

I went to My Florist for brunch w/my management team from work.  They were so gracious about seating us at a large table, and never rushed us, although we worked through the morning and into lunch hour.  My colleague said the coffee drink she ordered was excellent.  I loved the scalloped potatoes w/gruyere cheese with my eggs.  The service was impeccable.  I look forward to returning for a more casual weekend brunch with friends.

Returned to My Florist for breakfast w/friends.  One friend and I always struggle w/the sweet vs. savory breakfast choice, so we frequently end up ordering one of each and splitting our orders.  We opted for this at My Florist.  We ordered the brioche French toast and the build-your-own omelette.  We got the omelette with gruyere cheese, spinach and bacon.  The portions were huge.  We each got a slice of toast w/real butter, half an order of gruyere scalloped potatoes, half a serving of fresh fruit, half of an enormous omelette, and 2 slices of French toast.  Our server had no problem bringing an extra plate for our meal, which makes splitting orders less messy.  Our coffee, water and ice tea were topped off continuously.  I can't say enough about the omelette.  It had big chunks of bacon, tons of spinach, and gooey melted cheese.  Fabulous!  Real butter and real maple syrup also get a big thumbs-up from me.  If only they had fresh-squeezed orange juice.

This is my gym.  I am a YMCA fan.  I love the age of the building.  I love that it's not pretentious, as another reviewer noted.  I think the rooftop running track is fantastic, and a great way to use space downtown.  It's not overly-crowded, but it's a busy place.  The only class I've taken there was FemStart, which was a kind of circuit-training program.  It kicked my but and made me really sore (in a good way).  It's usually very clean, but last time I went (on a Sunday afternoon) the women's locker room smelled bad.  There was no bin for dirty towels, and people just threw them on the floor.  When I mentioned it to the (male) staff, they seemed unconcerned.  There's plenty of equipment, and a good variety.  There is a dry sauna, a jacuzzi, and an indoor pool.  Last week, while I was on the weight machines, a man brought two young boys into the exercise room, even though there is a sign on the door indicating no children under 12 are allowed.  A staff member IMMEDIATELY approached him and tactfully redirected him to the family exercise room, which is available if you ask for the key at the front desk.  I really appreciated their attention to maintaining the environment.  I was disappointed that the tricep machine was broken on my last visit.  I hope it's fixed when I head over there in a few minutes.  I also appreciate the fact that they have dedicated motorcycle parking, since I am sometimes a scooter rider.  They do, however, need more and better bicycle racks.  I worry excessively about my bicycle while I'm at the Y.  Even though it's double-locked and I remove the seat, I feel like it's really vulnerable.

I walked int0 Arizona Art Supply and fell in love.  I moved downtown 2 years ago, and I've never quite gotten my craft room up and running.  But I had a particular project in mind, and stopped by the shop on a weekend for some spray adhesive.  I struggled to find a place to lock up my bike.  They lose a star for this, as everyone does in my world.  Ended up locking to a sign in the middle of the parking lot.  Once inside, I was dazzled by the available materials.  I hadn't been in an art store for a year.  To make matters even better, they were playing the soundtrack from Amelie, and the cashier was a handsome tattooed young man.  I will regularly visit for inspiration and supplies.  This place is a treasure.

I ate here because I've worked in this general area since 2002 and have never patronized this establishment.  I was wise not to do so.  YUKKKY.  I ordered a ruben, which seemed safe.  The dressing was overly-sweet, as was the coleslaw, which was my only salad option.  The fries were the thick-cut kind that never seem to get crisp.  Just simply awful.

When I saw the Ace Hardware across the street was gone, I was worried for Burrito Express.  I used to eat there regularly when I lived in Mesa, and was looking forward to enjoying it again.  I was relieved when I rode my bike up into the plaza and saw they are still open for business.  There's no bike rack, but they let me wheel my bike inside.  The guy behind the counter couldn't have been less helpful if he tried, but I eventually found the enchilada combo on the menu and ordered up.  These enchiladas are second only to Carolina's, as far as I'm concerned.  Their beans used to be too salty for me., but on this visit, they were quite tasty.  I like their red salsa a lot.  They get an extra star for serving fountain Pepsi; that's standard Yelping procedure for me.

I was worried that the "new" Lux would not be as chill as the "old" Lux.  I was silly.  Although the lines to order can sometimes be long, the team does a pretty good job of managing it.  The pastries look amazing.  I LOVE the typewriters!  Lux offers plenty of food and drink options, and is right on the light rail.  It's conveniently located near the shop where I take my bike for service, so I while away the time @ Lux while waiting for my latest bikey upgrade to be completed.  I'm always whipping out my phone to use my Sound Hound app, because the music is really excellent.

I went to AZ 88 with a friend who was craving beef.  It was a Sunday afternoon, and we were heading to a matinee film after lunch.  Service was prompt.  We decided to split a burger and waffle fries.  Our server was very attentive.  In fact, it seemed like there were severs waiting in the wings, in case.  The iced tea was delicious.  We had no complaints.  And yes, the restroom IS all that.

Oh, Matt's...how I love you!  The best waffle ever!  The friendliest service.  The most congenial endless wait in the valley.  The locally-sourced foodstuffs.  There's nothing about you that I don't like.  I can sign in on your list, go to the Farmer's Market, come back and sip water w/orange slices and fantasize about what I'm going to eat.  I adore the fresh-squeezed orange juice in the cute glasses with the rooster on them.  And the potatoes with rosemary?  Heaven on a plate!  I have never, ever been disappointed or had a bad experience at Matt's.

Matt's new location is bigger, but they have preserved the ambiance that makes Matt's a breakfast destination.  It doesn't matter how big they make the diner; there will always be a line to get in there!  The simple secret is the fresh, real ingredients they use, locally-sourced whenever possible.  When you're a regular, they know your name and your order.  Big plus, in my book, is the new digs have a bike rack.  LOVE Matt's Big Breakfast!  It truly is as good as it gets.

I should only order enchiladas @ Carolina's, I guess, because I am always disappointed when I order them anywhere else.  One star for excellent service, one star for awesome beans, one star for serving Pepsi, and one star for plentiful bike racks along Mill Ave.  Found the popular American music an odd choice...Stevie Nicks is not what I expect to hear while I'm noshing on chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa are complimentary.  And the salsa has a slight bite and is very flavorful.

OMG!  My food was so tasty.  It was First Friday, and I called ahead.  They said they were booked up but come on in and they'd make it work.  They did, indeed.  They were insanely busy, but we opted for seating in the full-service bar.  The wait staff was fast, discreet, helpful...I can't think of enough positive adjectives.  I got the pork enchilada thing.  It came with super garlicky rice, yummy smokey beans and a dab of masa.  It was SO CRAZY GOOD!  I'm not a fancy-drink girl, and I found the beer selection a little disappointing, so they lose one star.  The atmosphere is chill and urban.  I love this place and will most def be back there.  BTW, they have a nice large room on the side of the main dining room that would be great for a larger party.

I live within walking distance of the Japanese Friendship Garden, so I enjoy it frequently.  Once inside, it's hard to believe you're still in Phoenix.  That's why I was so happy when Groupon recently offered a half-price membership.  I would join in a minute, except they're closed from May to October or so.  Half-price membership seems about right.  The atmosphere is gentle and meditative.  I feel safe sitting on a bench and actually meditating here.  The koi kind of freak me out.  They've been fed so often  by visitors that I feel fairly certain they'd eat me if I fell into the pond.  Last time I visited, there were baby ducks in the house.  So cute and fluffy, and they had no fear of people.

I love this place so much.  It has totally been my summer hangout this year.  We come for a meal, and then use the card they give you with the bill to swim in the pool and enjoy the jacuzzi.  I am excitedly planning a staycation with my gal pals next summer at the Clarendon.  It is so convenient to uptown destinations.  We will bring our bikes and cruise around. But I digress.  The pool is gorgeous.  It has an underwater speaker system rocking a sweet surf mix.  It has tiny lights in the floor, so that when you look at it from the rooftop, it glistens.  The jacuzzi is huge.  It's as long as the pool is wide.  Both pool and jacuzzi have bench seating all around.   I love the Taco Tuesday madness, the Wednesday flamenco dancing, and the Saturday rooftop yoga.  I love the Gallo Blanco restaurant and the artwork displayed throughout the place.  I love the pictoral history of the Don Bolles murder.   I love the glass wall in the elevator and the license plate room numbers.   I can't wait to actually stay here!

I love Stinkweeds.  Owned by local commerce booster Kimber Lanning, Stinkweeds provides better selection and pricing than many national vendors.  The staff are helpful, and if they don't have what you're looking for, they'll happily special order it for you.   The parking lot is smallish, but I've never had a problem finding a space.  The central location is a big plus.  They share the plaza with other locally-owned businesses, so it makes for a fun shopping excursion.  Their listening stations are well-stocked with a variety of music, and the staff loves to talk music, as well.  They also carry a great selection of music mags, as well as some books.

I love the merch inside of Frances.  The clothes are beautiful.  The accessories are whimsical.  They carry Tom's shoes and Frye boots.  I have my eye on a super-soft pink leather wallet with a bicycle on the front.  Stuff here is pricier than other places, but I don't mind, because it's unique.  I am always able to find a super-special gift here, and it's right off of the light rail, so it makes my shopping experience easy.

I know I can buy Toms cheaper at Nordstrom.  Nordstrom, however, is neither locally-owned nor on the light rail!  Plus, I know for sure there's a bike rack at Frances, and I can also support Stinkweeds at the same shopping center!

Shortly after I posted my review on Yelp, I received an email from the owner of the Wildflower stores.  He wanted to assure me that Wildflower is a locally-owned chain (which I knew).  He let me know he belongs to Local First Arizona and the chambers of commerce in every city in which they operate (which I appreciate).  He offered to send me a gift card, so I could try other selections (which I also appreciate).  But what really bowled me over was his willingness to meet with me to hear any suggestions I might have for their menu.  Hey, if I was that much of a foodie, I probably wouldn't even EAT in restaurants; I would cook for myself.  But I was really impressed with how much the man cares for his business and his customers.  I'll be trying one of the salads about which my friends rave soon.  I'll keep you posted.

Went back to Arcadia's Wildflower Bread Company today for a farewell lunch for a coworker.  I started Weight Watchers on Sunday, so I prepared by going to the Wildflower website and calculating the "points" from their nutrition pages.  Thanks, Wildflower, for making that info available.  But, Holy Cats!  My friend had urged me to try their salads, which she loves.  The two salads for which I calculated "points" totalled 22 and 23 points.  My daily total is 29 points.  And salad is not great as a leftover.  I ended up with the vegetarian lentil soup.  I could eat the bread with butter and my total was still only 11 points.  Plus, I tried a new soup and am now a big fan of the tasty veggie lentil.  Parking was once again a challenge, but I was on my motor scooter, which enables me to improvise parking.

I love my local Farmer's Market whole-heartedly!  I used to travel in from the 'burbs to attend, and then decided to move downtown.  The market definitely informed my decision.  I love buying food from people who raise it themselves.  I learn about new foods (this week: sorrel, which is a green that has a bright, lemon-y flavor...yummy in a salad) from the vendors.  I shop the indoor market, too.  It's great to be able to buy kombucha and hemp milk in the neighborhood.  There's a great selection of regional craft beers, too.  And don't even get me started about the wine selection.  I love that the market has installed awnings and a misting system that utilizes harvested rainwater.  And that they've planted trees.  And that they host the mobile food court, or "Food Truck Friday," which helps local food entrepreneurs connect with the public, and provides a great lunch alternative downtown.  I ESPECIALLY love that the market is replacing a single metered parking space with racks for 16 bicycles.  I ride my bike here most weekends, and will appreciate the expanded parking space.  I can purchase most everything I need at the market, and I feel good knowing that my dollars are staying right here in our community.

Nice try, but no cigar, as they say.  There's not enough shade to enjoy this park during the day most of the year.  There's no grass.  It's too small for a big dog to really run.  The trashy people that frequent it don't clean up after their dogs, so you really need to watch your step.  Worst of all, people ignore the signage and bring their un-neutered dogs into the park.  On a recent foray, the next two people to enter the park after me had un-neutered males who immediately tried to hump my spayed female.  The sign in front of the park clearly states that the city "highly recommends" only spayed/neutered pets in order to avoid aggressive behavior."  Makes me think they probably don't get their dogs shots, either.  I moved to downtown to avoid driving excessive distances, but it seems like I need to go to the suburbs to enjoy a dog park where the owners are responsible.

The light rail attracts a totally different demographic than the bus system.  I ride the bus occasionally, so I totally notice the difference.  The light rail riders are obviously people en route to work, school, shopping, or cultural attractions.  I rarely see chronically homeless people on the trains.  Bike riders abound on the light rail, and I enjoy talking to other riders.  The light rail ride is much more social than the bus ride, perhaps because more seats are facing one another.  Or perhaps because the riders aren't all crazy homeless people.  Today, my train broke down @ 24th St.  We were redirected to the station that serves westbound trains, and about 10 minutes later, an eastbound train picked us up.  It was really pretty painless.  My only complaint is the lack of vigilance.  A guy got on with an improperly-contained soft drink recently, and it exploded all over the car.  It got into my bike's brakes, and they started squeaking horribly immediately.  If only there were occasionally people on the platforms to put an end to the illegal cigarette smoking or in the cars to prevent spillage and litter...otherwise, I have no complaints.

The downtown campus is so nice.  It's a quick bike ride from my house, and I can hit the public market on the way home.  It is modern and clean, so unlike the liberal arts classrooms in Tempe.  The campus has a more progressive feel than the Tempe campus, too.  Maybe that's a result of having the social work, nursing, and journalism programs located here.  Desktops have integrated plugs for your laptop, as opposed to the 20 cords competing for 8 outlets in Cowden Hall in Tempe.  I think it's ridiculous that the offices and bookstore think they're supporting working students by staying open until 5:30 p.m., though.  Unless you work on or adjacent to campus, you can't accomplish anything without taking time off from work.  I hope ASU downtown embraces the independent downtown culture, rather than driving it away.  Let's not have Mill Ave. Part 2, PLEASE!

I was so excited to go to St. Francis for brunch with my friends today.  I've been hearing glowing reviews of this restaurant, and have been eager to try it.  We just beat the Sunday morning rush.  We were a party of 6, and we were seated at the long, uncomfortable table with the bench seats.  The seats were too low to really be easy to slip into and out of, and on one side of the table there were no backs to the seats.  How comfortable can that be?  Anyway, the menu looked delightful, and the Cartel coffee was strong and delicious.  We ordered a couple of their sticky buns to share.  They were huge, and quite yummy.  I ordered the basic American Breakfast (2 eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast).  The only thing I finished was the bacon.  The eggs, while light and fluffy, were bland.  There was neither salt nor pepper on our table, and we weren't offered hot sauce.  The toast was dry.  While the bread was good, could I possibly have some butter, please?  And the jam was overly-sweet and tasted like Smuckers--nothing special.  The potatoes were whole fingerlings, and were so dry I only ate one and left the rest.  Blah.  On the plus side, the male servers were attractive and our all-female party enjoyed that aspect of the experience.  I love what they've done with the building, and I'll give them another chance at lunch or dinner, but I won't be going back to St. Francis for brunch.  We HATED the valet parking.  It was raining outside and we had to wait in line for an unreasonable amout of time for our car.

Our administrative assistant at work is a big fan of Bertha's.  And now, I am, too.  She's ordered in lunch from Bertha's a couple of times.  The first time, it was the Thai chicken salad, which I loved.  Today, we had two salads and a sandwich tray.  I don't even like sandwiches.  I helped myself to both salads, and picked up a sandwich, intending to dismantle it and eat the meat and cheese.  Inexplicably, I took a bite of the sandwich, and said "OMG!  This is so good!"  It was the turkey w/bacon and avocado sandwich.  My friend seated directly to my left said, "Let's go to Bertha's and order more of these after lunch."  They were truly that good.  The salads were both great, too.  I think we'll be frequenting Bertha's a lot in the immediate future.

Perhaps this store has a wider selection than the one closer to my home.  But, since I do most of my shopping @ TJ' s and the Public Market, this matters not to me.  I ventured to the Osborn St. store because the neighborhood Safeway was out of Guinness Stout.  I thought it smelled funny.  And the cashier's oddly aggressive efficiency was unnerving.  I was considering the purchase of a gossip magazine, but felt like he'd yell at me if I broke his stride.

I found the solution to one of the biggest problems I encounter living car-free in Phoenix:  Goober Pet Direct!  It's hard to schlep a huge bag of dog food on the light rail!  I was introduced to Goober by the Gabriel's Angels volunteer who visited one of the Head Start centers where I work.  I looked them up on line, and discovered to my delight that they carry the food I feed Tallullah (Blue Buffalo Wilderness Salmon).  I ordered on Saturday, and the food was delivered Monday afternoon.  It came with a "new member welcome kit" (pet magazine, refrigerator magnets, catalog, refer-a-friend cards) and two bags of free bones for Tallullah.  The delivery man was friendly and they are locally-owned (Whoo-hoo!).  Plus, they donate a small percentage of your order to local pet non-profits.  I gave back to Gabriel's Angels, buy you can also select various rescue groups and shelters.  Shipping is free, and the price is comparable to Petsmart, where I usually buy Tallullah's food.  Goober's Pet Direct carries food, treats, toys, supplements, and grooming products for dogs, cats and birds.  I imagine I will use them for all of my pet needs in the future, since my first experience was totally positive.

Placed a second order.  Same timely delivery, same bag of treats and another pet magazine with the order.  Got some ear wipes, as Tallullah suffers from ear schmutz (technical term for the condition), and they make it super-easy to keep her hears clean and sweet-smelling.  C'mon, people!  I KNOW I'm not the only one who smells my dog's ears on a daily basis...

When I finally visited this park, it was to scope out the dog park.  It's the only off-leash area in downtown Phoenix.  I was amazed at the size of the actual park.  And I loved the water features.  Took a bunch of friends there for a bike ride/picnic while it was still nice outside, and we had a great time.  I haven't really checked out the playground area, so I don't know how much fun it is.  All that being said, I have to agree that the dog park portion of the park is, indeed, "ghetto."  There's no grass, not enough shade, and dog dookie all over the place.  My biggest beef was the un-neutered male dogs who tried to hump my spayed female.  That was lots of fun for both of us (NOT).  And since I have a dog at home, not kids, and I don't fish, this park gets a fairly low rating from me.  I may still ride my bike or walk through there, but I'll never subject my dog to irresponsible pet owners again.   If they don't spay/neuter, who knows whether they even immunize or prevent parasites?

My piping hot gyro arrived before I even finished yelping my check-in.  It was loaded with well-seasoned meat and lots of veggies.  It was huge.  I couldn't finish it.  The salad was crisp romaine with cucumbers, tomatoes, and just enough red onion to lend flavor.  There was a generous amount of feta; lots of flavor for little fat.  Only one kalamata olive, though.  The place has an unassuming diner atmosphere, and a drive through window.  The staff were efficient and friendly.  They lost a star for the single olive and Coke products ("No Coke.  Pepsi!)"

I've known about Noble Beast ever since they opened, but haven't had much occasion to shop there.  This recently changed.  My 11-year-old golden retriever has been experiencing digestive issues for months.  I have been making her homemade food with chicken, brown rice, kale, yams, etc., but I long for the simplicity of feeding her kibble again.  I went to the Certified Local Festival recently, and the shop had a booth there.  They were very generous with samples, and I found a kibble Tallullah seemed to be able to tolerate.  I went to the shop a week later, coudln't remember the name of the food, but a very comely young lad steered me in the right direction!  We found a grain-free kibble that works for my dog.  Noble Beast also has a loyalty program, and you don't need to carry another wallet-busting card to take advantage of it.  The service is great, and the atmosphere is wonderful.

I've been to Sens a couple of times.  Somebody advised me to let the waitstaff be my guide, and that proved to be a good strategy.  Small plates are the theme at Sens, and two people can sample a large variety of items.  My favorite so far is the hot and sour soup, which came at the end of the meal, even though we ordered it first.  It was so yummy, with unexpected ingredients.  The music is excellent, and I love the decor and atmosphere.

I finally made it to see the Derby Dames.  I decided I was done waiting and bought tickets for 3 of my friends for the 2011 season opener.  We had such a blast!  It's really easy to follow the action, the announcers are great, and the banked-track makes for really speedy bouts.  My friends and I picked the winners early on this particular evening (Coffin Draggers and Bombshells).  There are some real stand-out performers in the league. They lose a star for the utterly lousy beer selection.  Bud or Bud Light?  Seriously? Other than that, everyone was super-friendly, from the parking booth attendant to the girls selling raffle tickets to the concession vendors and the cops checking I.D.s.  The music was great, the fans were fun, and I think it's safe to say I'll go back for more. I need to add that these women are working hard for the love of the sport.  From fundraising to cleaning the venue after the events, it's a volunteer deal all the way.

My friend and I saw Monkey Lights during our first Critical Mass ride, and HAD to have them.  My friend Gail is pretty relentless when she has a goal, and she had phoned up all the local bike shops by the next week to search for said lights (Google them - they're AMAZING).  The guys at Trailhead ordered them and we paid the same we'd pay on Monkeylectric's web site, less the shipping.  The guys were friendly and helpful when we went to pick up our lights, which came in just a couple of days.  The cafe is awesome, too.

I took 2 pairs of Fluevog boots and a bag in to be repaired.  I had each pair of boots in the flannel bag from the Fluevog store..  I was not given a receipt when I dropped off my boots.  I was just told to come back in half an hour.  That made me uneasy, because those are some pricey boots.  Also, the place has a sign that states cash or check only.  Who does that?  I had to go get cash.  Annoying.  When I picked up my boots, one of the flannel bags was missing.  I asked for it, and was told I hadn't brought the boots in the bag.  I carefully packed each pair in its own bag for transport (as I said, pricey boots), but I could see no benefit in insisting on the return of my property.  I won't be going back to this place, if I can find an alternative.

I went to an Infant Mental Health training at ASU on Friday.  At the lunch break, the instructor suggested Engrained at the Memorial Union.  I went to graduate school on the Tempe campus last year, and I'm so bummed that I didn't know about Engrained then.  They really need a higher profile. The pros: they use locally-sourced ingredients in a creative manner.  The menu offered several entrees built around Maya's Farm veggies.  My quesedilla of grilled asparagus with a cilantro lime cream sause was fantastic.  My friend said her panini and salad was really good, too.  It's nice to be able to look at the food before ordering it.  The seating is comfortable and the employees were friendly.  In spite of the confusing system, our food was delivered to our table very promptly. The cons: the ordering system is confusing, as others had mentioned.  I asked about it at the station where we got our table number, but still made the mistake of trying to order at the wrong place.  And it's on the ASU campus.  Parking is a nightmare; I took the light rail the day of my visit.  I'll probably rarely get to eat here, but I enjoyed the experience.

OMG!  I SO LOVE this place!  Even the iced tea is outstanding.  But I have to write about the carne asada.  This is the best carne asada ON THE PLANET!  They use ribeye steak and serve it with a roasted tomato salsa.  Oh, so yummy!  It's a party in your mouth, for sure.  You can get it in tacos or a burrito.  The burrito comes with chunks of avocado; my friend loved it.  In fact, she had it on Friday night and again for lunch on Saturday, and she swears they put crack in the carne asada.  For dessert, I got the tres leches cake, which came with coconut milk ice cream and a pineapple rum sauce.  I almost asked for a spoon to get the last of the pineapple sauce.  Plus, it's in the Clarendon Hotel.  The decor is hip, the vibe is very cool, and they let you use the pool if you ride the Critical Mass bike ride.  They have rooftop seating.  I haven't tried them yet, but I hear the drinks are great.  Plus, they use locally-sourced food.  What's not to love?  I'll be back there Tuesday for the taco special!

Had breakfast @ Gallo Blanco for the first time today.  A friend and I, in our usual sweet/savory breakfast quandry, opted to split the chillequilles (sp?) and the flapjacks.  I love that they call them "flapjacks."  The chillequilles did not disappoint.  They were 2 sunny-side-up eggs atop a bed of green chile with chicken and tortillas.  The sauce was to die for.  The flapjacks rivaled those at Matt's Big Breakfast.  They are made with sour cream, and are mighty tasty.  We had to ask for extra syrup, though.  Gallo Blanco has fresh-squeezed OJ, which is pretty much requisite for a 5-star rating from me.  As usual, the people-watching at Gallo Blanco can't be beat.  Our server was a little slow with the beverage refills this morning, but not enough to lose a star.  I want to eat everything on the menu, and I think I will make that my personal goal this year!

I go to Local Breeze pretty regularly.  I mostly go for brunch with the girls.  I like their spicy Bloody Marys.  I'm not crazy about the potatoes, but I LOVE the spicy cottage cheese, so that's what I order with my meal.  The portions at LB are HUGE.  We always have leftovers.  The mojito style lemonade is also a treat.  Service is prompt and attentive.  We love the bike rider brunch discount on Sunday.  Have gone in the evening after Critical Mass bike ride, too.  It was busy, but the quality of food and service was still good.  The firecracker shrimp are my current favorite.  They have a spicy cajun sauce and come with crusty bread.  Yum!

I usually go to Local Breeze for breakfast.  This First Friday, we rode our bikes over for dinner.  Our original destination was Cibo, but they were slammed.  Plus, there was nowhere to lock up our bikes.  We headed around the corner to Local Breeze, and were told there would be a 45 minute wait.  Hey, at least they're bike-friendly!  There were several empty tables.  I asked about them, and was told "those are tables without servers."  We sat at one of those tables, grabbed the New Times,  went to the bar for drinks, and waited.  I'd say it was more like 20-30 minutes until we were seated.    We ordered the firecracker shrimp appetizer, which we all loved.  We sopped up as much of the flavorful sauce as possible with the included French bread.  Our only complaint was the uneven number of shrimp...11.  If there were 12, it would be evenly distributed to groups of 2, 3, 4, or 6...seems like a no-brainer.  Two of us ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, and one ordered the Ribeye with Gorgonzola.  When our food arrived, the presentation was impressive.  However, the actual food left a lot to be desired.  My friend ordered her steak medium, and it was just too bloody for her taste.  She finally decided to send it back.  Our salads looked lovely, but the tuna was not at all seared.  It was a little raw in the middle, with none of the savory goodness of a well-cooked piece of fish.  While the greens were very fresh and tender, we both felt there was too much roasted red pepper on top of them.  Roasted red pepper is a wonderful accent, but more is not necessarily better.  The salad was supposed to come with a wasabi aioli, which we did not see anywhere on our plates.  The cilantro lime dressing was fantastic.  I would've been happier with less quantity and more quality.

Conveniently located across the street from the light rail stop, Dutch Bros. Coffee is a stop whenever I take my bike and trek up the train line to do a little shopping along Camelback Corridor.  The servers are amazingly upbeat and cheerful.  I can ride my bike right up to the window.  I just order an iced coffee, black, no sweetener, so I can't say much about their drinks.  But I stick it in my cup holder and pedal on.

Good lord.  I don't ask for much.  I ordered a slice of quiche and an iced coffee.  They didn't have to bake the quiche, just warm it up.  I waited 15 minutes and then went to the counter to ask for it.  The server looked confused and the Guy who took my order said he "got lost."  I heard the server apologize to at least three tables (but not to me).  She told one guy the toaster burned his cinnamon raisin bagel (the last one in the shop) and insisted repeatedly that SHE didn't burn it--it was the toaster's fault.  Quiche was tasty, though.  The server said it was mushroom and spinach, so I had to wonder for a minute what the bright red things in my quiche were...then, I figured out it was mushroom and chard.  Coffee was "eh."  The floor looked dirty.  There was a paper towel in the toilet.  Ok, I'm nit-picking now.  The place was moderately busy; the small private parking lot was full.  Fortunately, I was on my scooter, so I could squeeze into a non-parking space easily.

This place is pretty great.  It's going to be wonderful when the habitat becomes well-established.  I've ridden down here on several bike rides.  There are miles of paved trail with lots of rolling hills.  It's a great place to ride a bike.  I'm looking forward to exploring more distance this winter, as I'm a much stronger rider than I was a year ago.  There are water features, plenty of birds, but the restrooms were closed last time I visited, due to the economy.  The views of the city are fantastic, and the distance you can ride on the paved trail without dealing with traffice draws me back again and again.  It's a gorgeous riparian habitat, and I'm happy that there are always other folks enjoying the area whenever I visit.

It was easy to park my scooter here, but I wouldn't have been able to park a car.   I was thirsty, and ordered the fresh-squeezed lemonade.  It did not disappoint.  I can see the cash-only policy posing an obstacle frequently, though.  I like the clean, urban look.  The place was pretty busy, for a Monday afternoon.  The music was good; the volume appropriate for conversation.  I like the dedicated computer-user seating.  I can't wait to come by for coffee and a pastry.

Went to Giant Coffee on Friday morning before work, because I was out of coffee at home.  Ordered a large iced coffee, but none of the tasty baked goods, because they only take cash, and I only had $5.  It was the most flavorful iced coffee I've ever had.  I don't take any cream, sugar, or flavoring in my coffee.  I like my coffee like my men...dark and bitter!  The flavor of the coffee was complex and delicious.  And I remarked to a friend at work, at 5:30 p.m., that I still felt "highly caffeinated."  I was STILL out of coffee on Sunday morning, because I hadn't been able to get to get to the place where I buy my beans yet.  So, I went to Giant (after stopping by a downtown credit union for ATM cash) to try breakfast.  I got the oven baked eggs with proscuitto.  The place was busy, and the meal was good.  I thought it a tad on the pricy side (over 12 for meal and coffee), but the service was excellent.  There seems to be parking space in the back, so my parking concerns are alleviated.  And it looks like the front of the shop might be able to open up completely when the weather cools, which would be amazing.  I am upgrading Giant Coffee to 5 stars.

I'm a fan of Total Wine.  In fact, I'm like a kid in a candy shop with all of the craft beers!  And the beer prices are much lower than at the grocery store.  I was craving pastis, the anise-flavored cordial enjoyed by the French in the summer.  Sure enough, Total Wine had it!  Plus, they have a bike rack (extra star & added to the list)!

I had breakfast down at the Public Market Grocery today.  I'd gone for my Saturday morning fitness walk with the good folks from the 100 Mile Challenge, and ordered my usual large iced Americano from Royal at the Market.  I was hungry, but a cookie/muffin didn't sound great.  I ventured next door to the market, and asked about breakfast options.  They have a quiche du jour, and I got the last slice!  It was yummy,  and came with a side of mixed purple and gold potatoes.  I asked if the new patio was open for seating, and they told me they'd bring my order out to me.  It was a lovely morning, and I had primo people watching as I enjoyed my breakfast on the green and light-festooned patio.

I typically only go to Royal when I'm at the Farmers' Market on Saturday mornings.  It's probably their busiest time, but they are pretty efficient, and the wait is never long.  I typically get an iced coffee or skinny latte.  They are tasty, but I am no coffee snob.  I love that there's no "extra-hot, extra foam, yadda yadda" b.s., like at some other places.  Inside, it's pretty cramped, and the seating is not comfortable.  Plus, I really dislike high-top tables.  But there are other, more pleasant seating options.  There's inside the Public Market, outside, on the grapevine-festooned patio, or, on Saturday mornings, in the "food court" section of the outdoor market, where you also have the added touch of live local music.

The guys who run this fun home decor store couldn't be greater.  If you have a question, they'll readily look up the answer for you on their computer or in a vendor catalog.  They focus on using recycled or renewable materials.  For example, I learned today (at home-ology) that mango wood is a sustainable resource, because mango trees eventually quit producing fruit, and the trees are often cut down and destroyed by the growers.  But the wood is attractive, and is now being used to produce furniture, lamps, and other home accessories.  They have a fun line of reusable shopping bags (so cute) and these awesome fragrance lamps that are beautiful and fill your home with a wonderful scent.

Went to this place for lunch with 4 Latina co-workers.  I was the only gringa in the place.  It's an order at the counter and they bring the food to your table joint.  I got the enchiladas, as I usually do.  At $6.50, they seemed reasonably-priced.  When the food arrived at the table (really quickly), I was amazed to see 3 fat enchiladas, rice and beans on a large oval plate.  Everything was delicious and tasted homemade.  Service was super-fast and congenial.  Co-workers also ate beef gorditas and steak ranchero, which also looked amazing.  Not a fancy place, but great food can be had here!

Once upon a time, I gave myself a repetative motion injury.  It was the end of the month, I worked for a social service agency with a state contract, and I wanted to finish my billing.  So, I worked overtime on a faulty keyboard.  The next day, I had a huge cyst on my right wrist.  I sought help through our workers' comp clinic, and had occupational therapy for a while.  I saw my PCP, and I got cortisone injections into my wrist.  She was talking surgery, if it didn't resolve with treatment.  Then, eventually, I went to see Robert.  This was 19 months after the cyst first appeared.  I asked him to work deeply on my neck and shoulders, as I was having other work-related issues due to the heavy tote bag I needed to carry with me to home visits.  After the session, I felt great.  But, later that night, as I was reading a book in bed, I noticed that the cyst was GONE.  More than 10 years later, it has not reappeared.  I still have some tenderness in my right wrist, which helpfully reminds me to be mindful of my work habits.  But the cyst has never returned.  Robert is professional and sensitive.  He has an almost uncanny sense of how far he can push or stretch a particular muscle or group of muscles.  He truly works in concert with his client, and seeks feedback throughout the session.  I recommend Robert and Synchronicity Massage Therapy without reservation

After waiting for seemingly FOREVER for this location to open, it took me a few weeks to get to actually eat at the downtown Pita Jungle.  It was initially a little confusing.  We rode our bikes from my place downtown, and locked them to a tree on 3rd Ave. side.  Not sure if there are bike racks on the patio side, which seems to be the main entrance.  There must be a parking lot back there, as all things Phoenix seem to revolve around the car.  We entered from the Roosevelt side, and a sign pointed us to a host station across the dining room.  We went in and out a couple of times (bike lights, water bottles, etc.), which seemed to attract a hostess to our side of the building.  We were seated where we could keep an eye on our bikes, which we appreciated.  Our server was upon us before my friend was even seated, offering drinks.  I hadn't even been able to scan the beer/wine menu, so she brought me a water in the meantime.   I was not impressed with the beer selection at all.  It was pretty limited.  I got the salmon dinner, which included wilted spinach and garlic smashed potatoes.  These are three of my favorite things.  They arrived quickly, and were hot.  I was less than pleased that my spinach was served heaped upon my potatoes and topped with the salmon.  I was ok with the spinach and salmon touching, but didn't really dig the spinach juices soaking into my potatoes.  But maybe that's just me.  My friend ordered the spanikopita and said it was ok.  She also got the pita melt, and said that was good.  A couple of other friends who also live downtown rode their bikes up shortly after our entrees arrived.  They got the hummus, and had to request extra pitas, as the two it included were simply not adequate.  He got the falafel.  She got the chicken lavosh.  The turtle cheesecake was delicious.  My friend enjoyed the rice pudding, which is made in-house.  I really dug what the Pita Jungle has done with the physical space.  It's huge and open.  There's a ginormous patio, too.  Not sure about the heating/cooling options outside, as we ate in the dining room area (as opposed to the bar area or the patio).  I LOVE the location.  It's a nice bike ride from my house.  It has a very chill, urban feel.  I hope downtown folks support this latest Pita Jungle venture.

Went here after the Critical Mass bike ride last night.  We had so much fun!  It was a great night to sit on the patio.  There was 80s karaoke.  I've only eaten breakfast here, so it was good to check out the other offerings.  My friends got a salad that looked fantastic.  Another friend got the biscuit sliders, and said they were yummy.  I wasn't hungry, but I did sample the homemade chips, both regular potato and sweet potato.  Both were delicious, but I thought the sweet potato chips had a more complex, interesting flavor.  We drank too many mojitos and mingled with our fellow bicyclists into the night.  The venue was very accommodating, and had set aside an area for us to lock up our bikes.  Fun!  Oh, and news flash!  The Duce will soon carry Rock Springs famous pies!!!

I loved this place.  We went on a rainy night in Feb., and because they couldn't seat us on the patio, they had to turn us away.  Undeterred, we returned on a lovely evening in March.  We asked to be seated on the patio.  Our server was knowledgeable and charming.  Everything on the menu looked both interesting and yummy.  We ordered the baked Brie appetizer.  It has a lovely presentation : baked in puff pastry with raspberry jam...gooey goodness!  I got the andouille sausage and shrimp stuffed tomato with cheddar pesto sauce on fettucine.  It was heavenly.  Such a wonderful combination of flavors and textures...smokey and smooth and rich.  My friend got the Sicilian pizza, which she said was very good, too.  Our server recommended a Portuguese wine that complemented my entree nicely.  But perhaps my favorite thing was sitting on a patio in downtown Phoenix and enjoying all of the people walking and riding their bikes past the restaurant.  I even saw a co-worker walking her dog.  Parking is super-convenient in the garage behind the restaurant, and the Pita Jungle is rocking a sweet new bike rack right across the way.  Since I forgot my Groupon in another purse, I will definitely be back to Centurion to try a yummy salad.  The spinach with blackberries and feta is calling my name!

Went back to Centurion after a wonderful day at the San Tan Wheelie Jam.  My friend and I were famished from all of our bike riding.  I called shortly before we left my house and made a reservation.  When we arrived, they seated us at a sofa, which was ok for drinks, but we requested to be moved to a table for our entrees.  They waitstaff was accommodating.  I got an item that's not on the menu, but was recommended by our server at my first visit to Centurion: gnocchi with white Irish cheddar sauce.  The waitress had to check with the chef, who said he would make it.  Oh, rich yummy goodness!  My friend had a pizza, and as on a previous visit, I felt I had the better experience by ordering their pasta.  Our waitstaffers were relaxed and flexible on this Saturday night.  Once again, I had a wonderful dining experience at Centurion.

Went back to Centurion with my son from Seattle and his good friend from Mesa in tow.  I got to pick the restaurant, because I live downtown.  I went to my favorite, Centurion.  Things did not go as I'd hoped.  My son made a reservation with his iPad while we were having drinks at FilmBar.  He did not see the (according to the restaurant) fine print about making reservations at least 2 hours in advance.  We did notice they had an iPad on the counter in the restaurant, BTW.  When we arrived, the waitperson told us they usually check reservations in the morning, and they did not have a space for us inside.  They graciously offered to light the fire pit on the patio .  It took several attempts, but they finally got it going.  It added to the atmosphere, but did not provide much actual warmth.  The staff, and even the chef were, however, diligent in checking on the fire.  My son's friend ordered pizza, but there was an issue with an intern who did not get or respond to the message to make more pizza dough.  Tom was happy with his second choice, the tilapia.  My son found the risotto rather meager.  I was very happy with my stuffed tomato fettucine with shrimp and pancetta in white cheddar sauce.  Throughout dinner, the chef and waitstaff were attentive and offered explanations about the issues we experienced.  While it was a mildly disappointing dinner experience, I still recommend Centurion for their wonderful food and attention to service.

OMG!  I love living downtown for so many reasons.  And I got to add Torched Goodness to my list tonight.  I first encountered this gourmet food truck at the Wednesday Public Market on Bastille Day.  They were hosting a French Dessert Smackdown.  I got to sample the lavender creme brulee, which was heavenly.  But tonight, thanks to social networking, I learned before I even left work that food trucks would be on my very street for First Friday tonight.  My friend and I rode our bikes the mere block to the corner lot, where we once again encountered Torched Goodness. A cursory inspection of the menu revealed the clear winner: maple creme brulee with the optional carmelized bacon topping.  We're talking organically raised bacon and local sourced dairy.  Torched before your very eyes!  It should probably be illegal.  It's that good. Dude is a serious foodie and localist.  And a super-friendly guy.  He's Le Cordon Bleu trained and loves what he does so much that you just feel good sitting at his folding table.  I give Torched Goodness my whole-hearted 5 stars.

I walked into Salon Embellish knowing little more than the fact that it's an Aveda salon, and it shares a plaza with an independent bookstore and an independent coffee house.  I have thick, wavy, graying hair, and I was just too hot.  I had no appointment, but they assured me that they could serve me in 20 minutes.  They were true to their word.  The stylist (Charlotte) took the time to listen to what I wanted, provided her own suggestions, and gave me an awesome, no maintenance short haircut that's garnered many compliments.  She recommended product that works well with my hair.  She did not attempt to convince me to color or blow dry my hair (big plus for her).  This short cut will require more maintenance, but I'm glad I did it, and I'll go back to Embellish for said maintenance.

I fell in love with this little shop.  It's not strictly limited to home and garden, though.  I just had to make a Yelp choice.  What it IS is a nonprofit that seeks to encourage the community to consider re-using and re-purposing items, rather than discarding them.  The owners have a mission to help individuals out of homelessness in a sustainable way, and the shop supports that mission.  Some of the items for sale are created by local people who were struggling with homelessness.  My friend and I enjoyed chatting with Lorel, the lovely owner and sharing local resources.  They carry Strawberry Hedgehog's locally-crafted and organic soaps, handcrafted jewelry, organic cotton clothing and more.  They are also starting a loaner bicycle service downtown.  I bought some great jewelry, some Healing Mineral Shaving Soap for my son in Seattle, and a cute bracelet handcrafted by local African refugee women.  ecocentricity!  adds to the local shopping options downtown.

This place was a total waste of time.  My friend and I did a long bike ride, and found ourselves craving burgers.  We considered our options, and decided to go with Five Guys because it was close to my house, would give us  a chance to check out Cityscape, and our president famously ate there shortly after taking up residence in the White House.  I am SO not impressed.  I ordered the little burger, which is a single patty, and the fries.  I got way too many fries, and there wasn't any ranch dressing evident into which I could dip them.  So, I was not inclined to eat my fries at all.  The burger was ok.  The big sacks of potatoes in the middle of the restaurant was not appealing (pun intended).  The place was noisy; the music was too loud for conversation.  And the Cityscape development is lame.

I've been here a couple of times for breakfast.  Both times I got a short stack and two scrambled eggs.  What can I say?  That's how I roll.  The food was good.  I think the pancakes at Gallo Blanco are superior, as is the waffle at Matt's.  But still, good pancakes.  The eggs were light and fluffy.  The coffee and the iced tea were both really tasty.  The service was super-friendly and yet low-key.  There is ample parking, and the interior couldn't be cuter.  It's big and roomy; it would be great for a large group.  They usually have some sort of sporting event playing on big TV in the back, so I sit up front in order to be able to read undisturbed.

Joe's seems to really have taken off.  Went here for brunch last week after I rode 13 miles on my bike.  The parking lot was full, and we had to improvise by parking in the center of the lot.  Joe's may want to consider restriping the lot (they have plenty of room for more spaces in the center; parking now is on the periphery only).  There was about a 10-minute wait, and they were in the process of training a hostess.  A friend and I split the waffle and eggs/bacon/potatoes/biscuit.  All was delicious, and I was ravenous.  The only bump came when we tried to pay our bill with a couple of different credit cards.  This seemed to fluster the waitress, who had been brisk and professional until that point.  Had to wait longer for coffee refills than I like, too.  Another friend got the veggie omelet, which looked teriffic.  Oh, and they have a bike rack outside.  Always a plus for me.

Jobot serves a mean iced toddy.  I drink one daily.  It's smooth and strong, but not bitter at all.  The restoration on the former Hood Ride is amazing.  I love the color scheme, the long bar, and the patio.  It was so great to bike by there and see people on  the pation with their laptops today.  I make the effort to go here before work to get my iced toddy, and that says a lot.  I can't wait until it's FINALLY cool enough to savor some of their hot coffee drinks.

Stopped @ Jobot for Beats -n-brunch after a great bike ride with some friends.  The place was slammed, which is great to see.  We pulled together several tables for our large group, but my friend who lives a few doors down had to bring some folding chairs from her house.  The food:  a friend and I split the Monte Cristo crepe (canadian bacon, smoked turkey, egg, swiss cheese with a side of raspberry preserves) and the cannoli crepe (sweet ricotta, shaved almonds and chocolate chips).  Both were wonderful, but we especially loved the Monte Cristo.  The tunes were great.  I went next door to Made and bought a magazine, and we hung out for quite a while.  The pedestrian and bicycle traffic on 5th St. made us feel like we were in a real city with genuine community.  Lots of people had their small dogs on leashes, too, which was fun to see.

OMG!  Had the pumpkin waffle w/marshmallow brulee, maple syrup and bacon for brunch today.  Fantastic!  Brunch-n-beats is back, and we enjoyed today's dj.  The patio was full and it was a beautiful day.  CenPho is the best!

I just have to give another shout-out to Jobot, my very favorite coffee joint in Phoenix.  Went there on a recent Sunday morning, and the special was "Slayer Cakes!"  This was 2 buttermilk pancakes with a bacon pentagram on top...mmm...bacon!  The place has been expanded, with additional indoor seating options, but I love the patio.  When I sit out there and watch the liveliness that is 5th St., it makes me happy.

I need to join Weight Watchers so I can buy super-cute vintage clothes at Antique Sugar.  They have a wonderful selection, and the staff are super-friendly (ie, not snobby or too hip for thou).  I especially enjoy their accessories.  They have amazing hats.  They play good music in the background and are helpful without shadowing you as you shop.  They offer a 35% Yelp check-in discount, which you can use at the time or save for later.

Finally got to explore the FilmBar!  Had a great time.  Met a friend for drinks before a show.  Great beer selection made drinking choices easy.  The decor is delicious.  I wanted to touch everything.  The lighting is wonderful!  My friend tipped me that the owner was our bartender/projectionist.  He was amazingly calm, even though it was a pretty busy Monday.  It was the only showning of Thor at the Bus Stop, which was a hilarious and clever film.  I appreciataed the customized previews.  FilmBar rocks, and I will be attending screenings frequently.  Side note: I left my jacket on a bar stool and came out to use the restroom.  When I finished, I found the bartender gallently holding my jacket out for me.  The service here is amazing right now.  Take advantage of it!

Oh, FilmBar, how I love you!  Went to a 5:00 show today.  I appreciate this venue more every time I visit.  Although the beer leans away from the dark, decadent, delicious side and they are always out of Kilt Lifter, I still love it here.  Today I saw "The Robber."  The heavy breathing and snowfall made me appreciate how great the sound is and how crisp the picture is.  The seats are super-comfy.  And kudos to Kelly for his savvy use of social media for marketing.  I've been here weekly for the past couple of months, and have seen the business grow like crazy.

I haven't had the opportunity to go to FilmBar for a couple of months.  I really wanted to see the film they're showing now about the end of the world.  I arrived 20 or so minutes before the show.  The staff recognized me and made me feel so welcome.  I had an excellent conversation with the proprietor.  The film was great, and I appreciated having the opportunity to discuss it with patrons after the showing.  Peach ale and delious popcorn added to my experience.  Great bike rake adds points in my universe.  Don't ever hate on FilmBar; talk to the owner if you have any concerns.  He's super-approachable and very cool.

Our fearless Critical Mass organizer arranged with Cycle for us to end our May ride at that establishment.  I was excited, because Cycle purports to be a pro-bicycle bar/restaurant.  We rolled up, all excited.  There were ample bike racks for our nearly 100 riders.  However, when we entered the hotel, we were brusquely directed to the bar entrance.  Having been to the restaurant before, I wandered out to check the dining room.  I was immediately turned back at the entrance and told the dining room was "reservations only."  Well, the bar has maybe 5 tables, and there were nearly 100 riders.  People who have just completed a 10-mile+ bike ride want to eat, drink, and be seated, not stand 5 deep in a bar line and then stand around holding their drinks.  We were not even sure we'd be able to order food.  We left almost immediately and went across the street to Portlands.  Right after we'd ordered, we saw another group of bikers headed to Carly's.  It's not like Cycle didn't know we were coming.  If you know 100 people are coming to your venue, don't you think you'd prepare to welcome them and encourage them to spend freely?  Lame.

I was primed to love this place.  I support indie businesses whenever possible.  I like vintage clothes.  However, I found it awkward and off-putting.  You have to walk through the salon to get to the retail space.  It smelled like old clothes.  While I found the display shelving attractive, I wasn't remotely tempted to buy anything I found there.  It seemed unorganized.  For example, there were a couple of Doc Martens boxes...are there shoes in there?  Are they for sale?  I can't speak at all to the salon services.  I just felt like an intruder passing through the salon to reach the retail.  I wish Mercantile all the best, but it was not a stellar shopping experience for me.

Went with my daughter to the St. Vincent/Cate Le Bon show at this venue last night.  The place rocks!  The stage is large, but very accessible to the crowd.  The lighting and sound are fantastic!  It is well-staffed, and even at a sold-out show, I never had to wait long for service.  It's a beautiful example of adaptive re-use, and most decidedly exactly what downtown needs to see more!  They clearly know their audience, too.  There were two large bike racks, which we were happy to see, since we biked the short distance to the venue from home.  The lounge is also cool; I will review the kitchen separately.  It was so gratifying to see so many people walking/biking/light-railing home after the show.  If you are a fan of live music, you will most definitely want to check out The Crescent Ballroom.  Well done!

Stopped by this adorable little nook just off of Mill Ave. after lunch @ Restaurant Mexico.  The flavors were all so tempting...Pineapple with chile, blackberry with lavendar, Mexican chocolate with spices...I wanted to order several.  Comfortable seating outside with shade and ample napkins for meltage made it an all-around pleasant experience.  Extra star for plentiful bike racks along Mill Ave.!

Denise catered my graduation party at the Alwun House when I got my Master's degree.  Everybody was raving about the food!  She made, at my request, aoli (garlicky dip) with lightly-steamed vegetables.  She also served grilled tortillas filled with butternut squash and goat cheese...yum!  She made several types of mini cupcakes, which were as delicious as they were adorable.  She served these with several types of sorbet crafted by our mutual friend, Jenny.  She made a watermelon fresca, and I'm told that the guys in the band were making floats with fresca and sorbet!  The presentation was gorgous!  One of the other women in my graduate cohort said, "I'm obsessed with your caterer!"  I've been to many of Denise's events.  Her menus are imaginative and delicious.  I recommend her without hesitation for your next catered event!

I took a canning class with Denise today.  I had a blast!  In a few short hours, we made preserved lemons, marinara sauce, peach jam with cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg and spicy dill pickles.  We processed everything but the preserved lemons in a hot water bath.  I learned a ton about putting up food with a great group of people.  Lunch was included in the class, and we feasted on a pizza with a rosemary-seasoned crust topped with fig jam, goat cheese and carmelized onions, a beautiful salad with a citrus dressing and yummy chocolate cupcakes with homemade German chocolate cake icing.  At $35 for the class AND lunch, I thought this was a fantastic value.  We all left with a jar of each of the products we made, and Denise emailed recipes for everything, including an e-book of uses for preserved lemons.  I'm not much of a cook, but I am looking forward to expanding my repetoire with Denise in future classes!  And I can't wait to sample all of the things I made today!

So, my sister and her family were in town, and got a good deal @ the downtown Hyatt.  CityScape is close, and they went to breakfast @ The Breakfast Club on Friday morning.  My sister is on a very strict dietary regimen, and they were able to accommodate her with a side of broccoli for breakfast.  So, she wanted to go back there for breakfast on Saturday.  I am always up for trying new things, especially breakfast.  And I'm pretty sure this place made a "best of" list I'd recently read.  So I agreed...despite my deep desire to go to Matt's.  I wanted to support my sister and her quest for better health, so I took one for the team.  Our server was fabulous.  She was efficient and remembered my sister's dietary needs from the previous day.  That's why they get 2 stars.  I found the setting quite generic.  The selection of pancakes/waffles/french toast was not at all tempting.  I got the basic eggs/bacon/toast/fruit combo with a side of potatoes.  Food came promptly, and was ok.  This is what really bothered me.  There were no condiments on the table without request.  My toast was dry, so thank goodness they asked if I wanted any jam when they took my order.  I know some people like their toast dry.  But I like mine with butter.  REAL BUTTER.  They asked if we wanted any hot sauce or ketchup.  We said "yes."  They brought us an assortment of hot sauces, and a tray with 4 little dishes of ketchup.  Nobody wanted any ketchup, so that was so much waste of time, energy and product.  This place is VERY generic.  I will not be returning, because there are so many more interesting and locally-owned options for breakfast downtown.  Oh, and Faux News does not help the atmosphere...just saying...

Bacon quiche with a side of balsamic-marinated strawberries.  Iced toddy.  Bike rack.  Outdoor seating!  There are tables on the front porch, but also a lovely patio area around back.  Close enough to the office to bike over for a coffee break, too!

A couple of my friends wanted to take me out to breakfast today.  I wanted to try this place.  They're locally owned, and the menu looked good.  I got a combo of pancakes, bacon and potatoes.  It has a place name, which I don't remember.  Everything was so dry.  I HATE it when a restaurant parcels out the syrup in little containers.  Just put a pitcher of syrup on my table, please.  Extra syrup could not render the pancakes finish-able.  The potatoes were also likewise very dry.  I only finished the bacon.  I didn't order, since I was the birthday guest, but it looks like you order your food and coffee at separate counters.  Is that the case?  And if so, is that necessary?  Do I really want to stand in 2 lines for my breakfast?  No.  I don't even want to stand in one line.  Unless that line is at Matt's.  Around 11:00, the music got so loud I had trouble hearing my friends talking.  And there were a LOT of kids there, if you're into that thing.  Also, I have had TERRIBLE reflux all day.  And that's all I've eaten today.  Just saying.

Sat down at the exact time as the guy next to me, who was served promptly.  Had to flag down the manager to get somebody to take my drink order, and the place is only about one-third full.  Waitress, when she did come, got my order wrong.  Finally got my beer, Noche Dulce from Borderlands Brewery in Tucson.  It's a vanilla porter, and delicious.  Had a great conversation with another downtowner.  Enjoyed watching the staff serve beer flights.  Tried to go back later to take my daughter to dinner, but the kitchen closed at 10:00.  Too bad, because the menu looked interesting.

Was not happy at my last pedicure.  I was just left in the chair for a long time.  Nobody did that super-skillful thing where they put on your shoes without smudging your nails.  So, I paid my money and walked out with a messed-up nail, even though I waited for a ridiculous amount of time for someone to put on my flip flops, thereby signaling the official end oft he pedicure.  This Ix just s one-time problem.

This festival is one of my favorite annual events in Phoenix.  I loved the new downtown location, but I had trouble locating the bike racks, which turned out to be by the beer garden.  I love the fact that this was such a bike and light rail-friendly location.  This year, the festival sold tickets to taste samples from local restaurants.  I thought it was a great idea, and sampled lots of goodies.  I enjoyed the beer and wine garden, and the fact that there were multiple breweries represented there.  I thought the music has been better in past festivals, but I still whole-heartedly recommend this event.

2014 Certified Local Festival...I love the venue, which is walking distance from my house, dog-friendly, and on the light rail line.  The assortment of vendors was interesting.  However, I brought my dog, as did a lot of other people, which made it challenging for me to eat any of the offerings from local vendors, because one hand was dedicated to controlling my pup.  There were picnic tables in the beer and wine garden area, but I would recommend for future festivals that seating should be a priority throughout the festival.  There were  lots of people who had their dogs with them, and it was a wonderful opportunity to socialize my dog.  And I think they probably had the same issue with trying to eat food samples while leashing a dog that I had.  Other than the lack of seating, however, this was a first-class event.

I went here to do my annual Christmas shopping at Smeeks.  I disapprove of the fact that Smeeks moved from the cool plaza at Central & Camelback.  As a bicylist, I appreciate small shopping centers that contain several interesting businesses and bike racks.  While I can still bike to the Biltmore, and the mall has bike racks, it's just not the same.  I would rather have these small, interesting, locally-owned businesses spread out in small, locally-owned shopping centers.    The Smeeks seems smaller and seems to have a more limited inventory than they did when they were in the plaza with Halo, Frances and Stinkweeds.

Phoestivus is a super-fun local holiday market, designed to promote small, locally-owned businesses.  It's held at the Wednesday night downtown Farmer's Market, and this year, expanded to two weeks.  The beer garden was a brilliant addition, and 100% of the profits from it go to support Community Food Connections, the wonderful organization that keeps downtown Phoenix from being a true food desert.  Local brews, local food trucks, local farmers and artists assure that the money you spend will stay here in our community.

I read about The Stand in the AZ Republic, and I was intrigued by their limited menu.  There is a double burger, and 3 kinds of street tacos: short rib, chicken, and veggie.  They also have fries, chips & salsa, and a variety of beverages...including milk shakes.  I am a sucker for the milk shake, and when I read that they have BOTH chocolate chile and salted dulce de leche shakes, I KNEW I had to try this place.  The very next day, I went with a couple of co-workers.  The first thing I noticed about the place was the big, bright blue BIKE RACK out front.  There is a drive thru, and the place gets busy for lunch.  The service was fast and friendly, but another coworker who went today on my recommendation said she waited a long time in the drive through line.  We found our burgers, fries, shakes and lemonades to be superior, and we all plan to go back to The Stand again.  I hope to be on my bike next time!

I was attending a conference at the San Marcos Hotel in downtown Chandler.  Whenever I attend a conference, I like to get out and explore the local businesses, even if the conference is in a suburb of my very own city.  So, when the sessions ended @ 5 p.m. on Thursday, I went strolling through Chandler's very charming downtown.  Because women are biologically programmed to be unable to walk past a shoe store, I stopped into Shoe Thrill, because, happily, they stay open until 8 p.m.  I was like a kid in a candy store!  They'd just gotten in a bunch of fall inventory, and the brands they carry are brands I love!  I fell in love with a pair of Allegrias that were 50% off, and they had them in my size.  I wanted to wait until my paycheck was direct deposited, so I promised to come back the next day.  When I returned on Friday, the staff remembered me, and brought over the shoes I wanted.  I shopped a bit more, and purchased two more pairs of shoes.  One of them was a pair of black nubuck Olukai loafers I've wanted for a while.  I'd seen them in the Terry catalog and REI online, but I really like to spend my money locally, whenever possible.  They are amazingly comfortable.  I am happy with all of my purchases.  Shoe Thrill has an fantastic inventory of gorgeous shoes and boots.  Service was friendly and casual.  They also carry some purses, hats, and jewelry.  I live downtown Phoenix, but I will willingly travel to Chandler to shop @ Shoe Thrill again.

First off, everybody should know there's lots of free parking available just north of the restaurant, off of 3rd Street.  There are both paved and unpaved lots.  So, do not be deterred by the dismal parking situation on and around Roosevelt St.  Venture forth and try Paz Catina.  For dinner, for brunch, for drinks and light bites...you won't regret it!  I've been to Paz 4 times now, and on my 2nd visit I was greeted like a regular, with high-fives from the host.  I've had tacos and margaritas for dinner, and chilaquiles and bloody Mary for brunch.  I had no complaints with anything I was served.  I have tried the pork belly, carnitas, and shrimp tacos, and all are delicious and unique.  The pork belly is hands-down my favorite.  On my 3rd visit, I asked my server about the street corn, which had been recently added to the menu.  He went back to the kitchen to get the answer, then returned and told me they didn't have it ready yet.  No big deal; I ordered tacos!  As I finished my meal, the owner slid a gorgeous ear of street corn, dressed to the nines, in front of me.  It was FANTASTIC!  We had a brief conversation about his approach to the menu (quality, in a nutshell).    The ambiance is, as others have mentioned, wonderful.  Very urban, with interesting art and interesting people.  There's a family-size table for large groups, and a room off to the side that, I assume, could accommodate a private gathering.  There's an inviting, dog-friendly patio.  I love the open kitchen, and actually saw a staff person photographing a plate on the counter before it went out to a table!  The music is good, and the TV is unobtrusive.  I am a huge fan of this place, and can't wait to go back and try the dulce de leche french toast!!!

Michael Reyes is a class act.  He does things well, and his new Paz Cantina food truck is no exception.  He is introducing empanadas, and I can't wait to try them.  He had duck empanadas today, but I didn't learn that until I'd already stuffed my face with two delicious pork belly tacos!  Oh, and he has a new location that looks to be long-term, next to Modified.

Yum!  This place is a gem.  It's in a tiny house on the south side of McDowell.  Parking is in front of the building next door.  We were the only customers for most of the time we were there.  I hope that changes, because this place deserves to succeed.  It's homey inside, with mid-matched tables and chairs.  Service was prompt.  My friend and I ordered melon aguas frescas, which were light and refreshing.  I ordered the chile relleno.  My friend ordered the enchiladas.  Another friend who joined us mid-meal ordered carne asada tacos.  The food was authentic and fantastic!  My plate was huge and full.  The chile was a fat poblano.  It was cheesy and was served with crema atop it.  The rice DID NOT have carrots and peas added; thank you very much.  It was topped with a modest amount of melted cheese...just enough to add interest. The beans were delicious, and were garnished with queso fresco.  I do not normally eat breads, but when a basket of fresh tortillas arrived, still steaming, I had two of them.  I could not finish my meal. So much food.  My friend's tacos were street tacos on a long tray, garnished with slices of fresh cucumber and lime.  The server brought her sauce and told her it was very hot.  She agreed that it was.  Her tacos looked fantastic!  This place is near my office, so I really really hope they succeed!
