Finally...a Mexican chain restaurant that I really like! I was weary about trying macayos at first (I can't stand arribas or on the border and thought this would be the same), but I'm so glad I gave it a shot. The food is really good and the drinks are strong, so you feel like you are getting your moneys worth. However it is 2$ for a small side of sour cream and I find that a little insane. The waiters were all really nice and we all enjoyed our food, this is now one of our regular dining places.

I eat here so much I'm actually embaressed! This place is amazing, I never liked any form of asian food before I ate here, I always order the same thing..sesame chicken with white rice and crab puffs. I like how tiny the restaurant is and the fact that it is family owned. The owners are so sweet, there is never a wait either. They have really good lunch specials and the food is always fresh.

The melting pot is always a great place to go with a date, it is nice because the dinner is an experience, and the staff is in no hurry to get you moving so they can fit another table in.   I have to knock down a star because they took away the quattro formaggio cheese (the reason I went to this place as often as I did). The spinach and artichoke is pretty good, and the desert is always amazing. I have always enjoyed every server we have had at the melting pot, they are so nice and really knowledgable on all of the food. It is a little pricey sure but well worth it if you need a comfort food fix.

Ate here several times and the only decent food is the rice. The service is good and the margaritas are good, but everything else sucks. If you are looking for good mexican food, this shouldn't be your choice!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! The food here is wonderful and the wait staff and bar are so friendly, you really couldn't ask for anything more! I love the new expansion to the bar area, and whenever we think good Italian food, we always pick arrivedercis. You won't be dissappointed!

I've only been here once so I don't have other experiences to compare it to, but I really like Pesto's. My ravioli was great, and the salad was amazing. They make their Italian dressing there, and it is just unbelievable. I am a Caesar girl, but this was fantastic. I was there for work so I couldn't drink, but the wine selection looked great. I would recommend this place for sure, and I will be stopping in again soon.

I like Pita jungle a lot, the pizza I had there was amazing, and the atmosphere is pretty cool. The server I had last time was quick and friendly and comp'd my daughters fruit bowl because it took him so long to bring my marinara sauce. The one thing I was disappointed with is that for the price, my pizza was really small, and for the same price, my friend got this huge pita. The pizza was about the size of a small microwaveable one. Usually I can never finish a meal when I go out to dinner, but here, I very quickly finished the whole thing.

We come to jasons all the time, we love it! My favorite is the club sandwich with the chicken pot pie soup, so so good! I like that they put a lot of meat on their sandwiches so you don't feel like you're getting jipped (like subway). Everything always tastes fresh and your food gets done quick, which is surprising considering they are usually so busy. Yum!

This place is awesome, hands down! You can not beat the happy hour/reverse happy hour specials, and there is always a ton of people there. The one downside is that happy hour specials are only served in the bar area or outside, but that doesn't bother me much, even if I do have to wait a litle while for a table. Their margaritas pack a punch and they make really great specialty drinks. Never had a bad experience here, and I love the location. Whenever we want to go somewhere for happy hour, kona grill is usually our first suggestion.

I really used to like this place but when the management changed, so did everything else. I remember when for lunch there would be a line to the door, now I never see anyone in there. I might go here 1 or 2 times a year, nothing really that great about it anymore, right when I step in the place seems kind of dirty and isn't very welcoming. If they made some changes..this place could be decent again.

Never been dissappointed here, awesome food and great service with even better prices! Whenever I talk to someone that hasn't been here, I immediately recommend it. There is usually a wait for dinner but it is well worth it, I haven't tried the pizza yet but everything else has been really good. A nice place to take a date or go with friends.

We love coming to PCL because my man knows the promoters so we always get cheap vip and bottles, the staff is very friendly, and I really love that they consistenly play awesome dance music (there is never an awkward moment of "how in the hell are we supposed to dance to this?!"). I wish they had a patio and more places to sit, but all in all its a lot of fun coming here and when we go to Scottsdale we make sure to stop by and have a few drinks.

For being an Italian restaurant, they sure do have amazing steak! Every time I come here I order the bacon wrapped filet mignon, it is one of the best steaks I've ever had! Our waiters have always been fantastic, and even though they don't always offer that specific dish, they will usually make it for me anyways. I love that it's quiet and romantic, and it can be casual or formal. Great bar area as well, we really love this place.

I actually like myst a lot, I like that there is a mix of different kinds of music and that it isn't so crowded you can't even move (like most of the other clubs in scottsdale (cough*american junkie*cough). It is a big place with multiple levels and always a pretty good crowd of people, not an overload of douchey guys like axis and pcl.This is usually the spot we head to first on a night out in Scottsdale, awesome DJs (ATB), and the bar tenders are usually pretty quick at getting your order, i especially like that once in a while they have 18+ nights so that my friends that aren't 21 yet can come out once in a while. All around a pretty cool place to dance the night away.

I have been going to this place for several years and it is just awesome! The food is amazing (The club sandwich and fries mmm) and it is a great place to hang out and have a few beers after work. The wait staff is always friendly and the live music is awesome! Keep up the good work CK's!

This place is absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend and I have been here for a few special occasions and have never been dissappointed, the food is amazing and the service is just as good, our waiter was so unbelievably nice. Their steak could possibly be the best steak I have ever eaten, and their creme brulee is to die for. This place even does complimentary filet mignon sandwiches for happy hour...guarantee you will love this place just as much as we do!

Went here for lunch today, not the best but not the worst. I got the turkey and havarti sandwich, wasn't very good at all. I don't know what type of lettuce they use, but it was awful. I got one of their red velvet cupcakes that several people told me are "better than sprinkles"....lies! They were ok, but no where near sprinkles status. I liked the ambiance and the outdoor seating, it's a cute little place to grab a coffee, but my husband and I won't be going out of our way to go here again.

Amazing!, I crave see on a daily basis! They are absolutely delicious, it's weird, they are like cupcakes from heaven! Sure 3.50 is a little pricey, but they truly are the best cupcakes I've ever had. Everyone there is always so nice and friendly, my only complaint is I wish they had one closer to my house! Get the red velvet...you won't be sorry. The lemon, cinnamon sugar, and peanut butter chocolate chip are also very good. Yum!!

I really like Dirty Pretty, the crowd is always pretty interesting and for some reason I like it better than some of the other Scottsdale clubs. The bouncers are always really nice and right when you get in you feel like dancing. It takes a while to get your drinks (they should probly add another bar), but other than that, a pretty cool place.

AMAZING!!! We have been going to firehouse for almost 2 years now after my friend introduced us to it, I have never tasted a sandwhich so good in my entire life! You walk in and you're immediately greeted by all the workers, they can get pretty busy during the lunch and dinner time rushes, but I don't mind waiting.   There is no way you can go into firehouse and not notice the array of hot sauces on display.I myself am not into spicy food, but my father and husband always get several samples to see who can handle the spiciest sandwhich (they have the spiciest flavors in their "vault", all you have to do is ask). Everytime I go I get the beef n cheddar smokehouse sub. They never skimp on the meat and the bread is always soft because they steam their subs, there is no better place to go for a sub, firehouse is definitely our fav! Keep up the good work firehouse!

I really try to like this place because it is close to home and my friends like to go play pool and have a few beers here, but the food is just awful. I've had about 6 different things (I've really tried to find something decent), but I just haven't liked anything except the french fries. Go here to get a few drinks, but as far as food goes...go somewhere else.

Every time someone brings up this place I literally cringe. Now before I continue, when I dislike a place with the amount of hatred that I have for an awful place like arribas, there is a good reason. I will never base my opinion off of one meal, I will give a place multiple chances before I write it off completely.  The food is absolutely disgusting, either too salty or not flavorful at all, I can not stand a single thing at this place. Just thinking about it makes me wonder how this place stays in business. Nachos..nasty Enchiladas..nasty Rice...nasty Flautas...NASTY! I could go on forever!  How a restaurant can screw up a big bowl margarita is beyond me..but somehow..this place can do it! Don't go here, recommend this place only to your worst enemy. EW!

These cupcakes were ok, but they taste just like they are from the grocery store. I dont know what's up with the frosting, it just has a strange taste. When I got there, there were hardly any cupcakes left, so my selection was limited, if they wouldn't have been buy one get one free, I would have never paid the prices they want for those cupcakes. It's ok, i would eat them again, but I don't think I will ever be going back. Sprinkles wins, hands down, anyone who says otherwise is nuts!

Never had crepes before coming here and I had no idea what I was missing. The food is always fresh, but the downfall is sometimes you have to wait over a half an hour to get your food. Everyone here is really nice and they have a great menu, they close at 4 so a great place for lunch or brunch on the weekends.

Went to Cream and felt like I was in a mental hospital? Why does everything have to be white, even white padded walls?!?! I hate that it is one of the only places in Scottsdale (besides PCL) that you need to buy bottle service/vip just to sit down! It is really small as well, we stayed here a total of about twenty minutes before we headed to myst. Probly won't be coming here again.

We went to fired up grill for the first time a few weeks ago....we wish we would have gone sooner! This place was great, the pasta was amazing, and the waiter was so friendly. He forgot I ordered a Caesar salad, so he made up for it with a free pazookie! Normally I don't like sweets, but this was the best pazookie I've ever had. My husband and I ate that thing like we hadn't eaten in days, it was awesome! We went here again yesterday and we were just as happy as we were the first time. Prices seem a little high, but the food is great. We will definitely be going here again.

So sad to have to update my review, because I've been here and actually enjoyed it, but a few Saturdays ago we went here for lunch and had the worst experience ever! They had one server/bartender for the entire restaurant. They weren't too busy, but the service was absolutely horrible. When we walked in we wait for about 5 minutes to be seated. We weren't greeted, and eventually just decided to sit ourselves. Took quite a long time to get any type of service, and when we need, the waiter needed to be reminded three times just to get our drinks. We finally ordered our food, pasta and a salad for me, and a burger and fries for my boyfriend. Once our food was delivered, it was cold. The fries looked and tasted like they came directly from Mcdonalds, he never came to check how the food was or if we needed anything, and he forgot my salad. When I reminded him, he apologized and brought it to me once I was almost done eating, and then had the nerve to charge me for it. This place is overpriced for the food and the terrible service, we will not be coming here again.

Not impressed with this place at all, I have been here several times on my way to the amc next door and it is just blah. I tried to dress it up with toppings but I ended up just throwing the whole thing away. The other time I sampled several different flavors and just wasn't feeling it.

We were driving by Lo Lo's the other day and decided to give it a try for lunch, I'm so glad we did! The food was really good, and even though the waiter messed up my food a bit, I really enjoyed the mix of waffles and chicken! It was so good, we will definitely be coming back.

Sandbar is an OK place to go in the daytime when you are having a few drinks, but at night this place gets crazy (which isn't always bad, crazy can be fun)...but not always in a good way. We come here because its close to home and we enjoy the ambiance, but the food is not very good at all. One Friday night we decided to go to Sandbar to have a few drinks and relax, and all of the sudden my foot is bleeding everywhere. There is some crazy girl throwing bottles and drinks at some guy she is pissed off at, and my friends and I have glass all over us and are drenched with sticky alcohol...I go to the bouncer to let him know the situation and that people are getting hurt by this psycho b*&%h and what does he do??? He kicks me out! I try to explain the situation to him but his little bouncer brain doesn't quite get the picture. They never did anything about the girl and my friends and I had to leave. This place is trashy...end of story.

Going to update my review, we go here all the time because it is so close to home and we really don't experience any problems anymore. The atmosphere is fun, it is always pretty busy, and the bartenders and servers are pretty fast and always friendly. The food is average, but it is a great place to go for a drink or two and to people watch.

Yum! Had the archerra (I think that's what it's called) burrito here for lunch, it was awesome! The margarita was good and the chips and salsa were great. I would give it 5 stars but our server sucked, took him forever to get my water, I asked for lettuce in the burrito and didn't get any, and he forgot my side of sour cream. The food was great though, and the prices weren't bad either. I'd definitely eat here again. Plus it's right down the street from sprinkles...what an excellent location! =)

We went here the other day for lunch and this place was absolutely dead. I've never been to a gastropub before so we were interested in seeing exactly what it was about. We ordered drinks and they passed off something that couldn't even pretend to be a strawberry daquiri..it was a soupy mess with ice chunks in it.   We ordered our food, I had the ribs and my boyfriend had the burger..we were both dissappointed. His burger had arugula and gruyere on it which is new to him, but it was also very overcooked. My ribs were also overcooked and i needed to smother them in BBQ sauce just to make them taste good. The fries were really great and the waitress was really friendly and nice, but I'm not sure we will be trying this place again.

Who doesn't love a good massage? I love this place, my husband and I have a membership and we only pay 80 a month, we both get a choice of an hour relaxation massage or facial. It is such a nice treat and indulgence each month. They can always get us in at the same time and usually even on the same day we want an appointment. The owner is so nice and everyone I've gone to is very good.

My husband called me from work one day after a coworker had brought in several dozen bosa donuts and he said, "I've just had the best donuts I've ever eaten". Me, being a pastry lover, had to give it a try. We went early one morning and got one of every donut they had, they were awesome! The place is a little hole in the wall and had I not been told to go, I probably would have never gone in. The donuts were soft and fresh, the cinnamon crumble one was my favorite, and they were also reasonably priced. We live in ahwatukee so it's a little out of our way, but we will definitely be coming here again!

I like caketini...but not as much as I like sprinkles. They are a little bit more expensive than sprinkles, a little bigger, but kind of tastes like the cupcakes you buy at frys, but a little better. I would go back here, but it's definitely not my first choice.

So so good, we love to come here for the Carne asada queso dip, it is incredible! The burgers are great, the waffle fries are amazing, I don't have much bad to say about this place. Wasn't a huge fan of the Buffalo chicken sliders, but besides that everything has been great. The staff is friendly and usually pretty fast. Go here, you won't regret it!

Wow what a disappointment. I've had cupcakes from here, they are actually not bad, and this place is a lot closer than sprinkles which is my go to cupcake spot. However, going here on a Sunday was a horrible idea. My kid has been whining about wanting a cupcake all day, so I figured let's save the drive to Scottsdale and stop at gigis which is much closer. Big mistake. I figured on a Sunday afternoon this place would have the shelves stocked with cupcakes, I went in with the intention of easily buying a dozen. The store was empty and so were the shelves, they had about 4 types of cupcakes available. I don't think I could have ordered a dozen if I'd wanted it. They should have just closed the doors! I asked if that was all they had, and the girl behind the counter said "we run out fast". Right, whatever you say girlfriend. No red velvet, no chocolate, nothing but disgusting Boston cream pie or peanut butter truffle. I will never waste my time in going here again, I'll take the half an hour drive to sprinkles any day.

I can't understand where the good reviews are coming from, the employees were pretty friendly, but other than that the pizza was mediocre at best. They gave me about the smallest side of Ranch in existence when I asked for it, and we couldn't be on their patio with beer for some reason. Won't be going here again.
