Been here before and it was WAY better than this last Thursday! Had veggie/hummus appetizer, burger that was ok, had one porter and one hefe and both were sub par, but the root beer float was the best thing I had even if I only got one scoop of ice cream...last time was the last time.

I love this place, less sodium in the food is the only critique?

Went today with a friend while our wives were at a bridal shower, and everything was perfect! Great wings, great pizza, great service, and great atmosphere.

Very pleasant place with an amazing appeal. The service was fantastic, food was quality, and again the patio on a beautiful March day was perfect. Will have to come back for dinner sometime.

Jim and his staff are top notch, honest, and reliable. If you don't take your car to them, you are just stupid.

We just ordered out for hot & sour soup, and it was great. One of the best we've had here in Phoenix. Ordered again...not better, but worse

First impressions are everything, unfortunately this place was dirty and I honestly was afraid to eat there.   My friend wanted Chinese and I agreed, but will never come back. The cup was dirty, the plate was dirty, and so I ordered the chicken curry to try and avoid getting sick. The chicken was rubbery and the potatoes were not cooked.   Worst Chinese food experience I have ever had in Phoenix. The reviews scare me with what you people put in your mouth and body normally. Never again!

Loved this place! Cool little place with very cool vibe and food. Wish they had one on the north west side of town. Will be back as I pass this way from time to time. Oh, and the iced tea was amazing as well.

Ordered a Vogue Burger to go and after a little debacle with the hostess thinking I wanted to order beer to go, I was seated, served a beer while waiting, and ten minutes later  walking out the door. The burger was amazing and one of the best I have ever had, just a little undercooked when I ordered a medium well...but VERY tasty!

Bought Hot & Sour soup when I was coming off a cleanse and WOW! It was fantastic, not sure about anything else, but I'll be back for sure.

Fantastic sandwich and even better potato salad if you're in the area you need to check this place out!
