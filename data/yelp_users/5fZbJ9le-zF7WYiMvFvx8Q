My fav Mex food in the valley.  Chorizo bean dip and cubed beef red enchiladas are my go to.  The land and sea platter is also amazing.  Also, the sope they serve with your meal at lunch is the best.

Amazing Caldo de Pollo and Menudo!  Brought me back to life.  Mucho Chimichanga is super good too.  Ordered for pick up, the soup was still blazing hot once I got home.  Something special about this place.  I will be back for more food!

Took care of my rear window that I had shattered while putting my son's wheelchair in the trunk.  Needless to say, I had my disabled son in the car at the time.  Sewall was out to my location within 30 minutes, during rush hour, and replaced the window without complications.  Saved me from a day of tremendous aggravation. Overly appreciative to this company.

Always get the After The Hike burger with Flying Belgian Pig fries and a flight.  The tri tip sandwiches are also really amazing.  Love this place!

Yelp not letting me delete my review...  This was not the company who serviced my windshield yesterday.
