Amazing buffet!  We have been coming here for years.  My husband and I like to consider ourselves China buffet experts (how sad is that lol).  This is the cleanest, most consistent Chinese buffet we have been to in 20 years in Phoenix.  We always take relatives and people from out of town here.  The food is fresh.  They are always adding new items.  The sushi is much better than any other buffet.  They make you a great variety of rolls, and they don't skimp on the expensive ingredients.  On crab night they keep the crab legs coming! We have never gotten sick, and we have never had any gross out issues here.  The staff is friendly, and over the years they have gotten to recognizing us and our 4 teens when we walk in.  We are customers for life!

Good rolls. The waitress was great at suggesting some new rolls for us.  We have had a little bit of a wait when we try to come here at other times.  But overall this is a safe bet for some sushi!

My husband and I took our daughter to this place Saturday evening.  It was not very busy, so we thought we would have smooth sailing.  We did not have to wait in line.  We ordered our food, and the first issue that I had was that the cashier did not know how to make change.  A little weird, but whatever.  Then we found a table, and proceeded to wait over 30 minutes for our food!  And no drinks either.  Like I said, it was not busy, and the kitchen had plenty of employees.  So there was no reason for this.  They were very unorganized, and that is something they need to address.  They had a dining room full of unhappy customers, all waiting way too long for their food.  The food itself was nothing spectacular.  Not bad, not great.  We had burgers, fries and onion rings.  The burgers were way smaller than claimed.  The onion rings were almost $5, and we got 6 of them on the plate.   The prices were way too high.  Many of the things served seemed like they were bought from a warehouse retailer, like the buns and the fries.  Not original or special.  This place needs some organization now! And some decor on the walls would be nice. I want it to succeed, because we need more local food joints out here, but this just was not worth it.

This was just a disappointing and awful experience.  We have been to other Texas Roadhouses in other states, and none of them were operated like this. This store bought grocery store buns for the hamburgers! Not their usual handmade buns. They were slow with service. The food was awful. So bland and boring. Horrible burger. They do not employ enough bartenders to handle the bar and tables. And the bar is ridiculously small compared to others. You can't get a drink! What a disappointment. The only redeeming factor- the hostesses were very nice. But I would not waste your time eating here.
