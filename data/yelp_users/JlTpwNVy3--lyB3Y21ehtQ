FOOD POISONING.   I have been here numerous times and the service has always been great but the food, especially the sushi is always dissappointing.   I went here recently with my friends and two of them were sharing sushi and both ended up with horrible food poisoning and were out of commission for two days.   I would NEVER eat at this place if I were you.

Hands down, some of the best Sushi in AZ.   I can't stop going to this place.  Of course the fish isn't always perfect but 9/10 times it is!

Due to the recent decline in service and quality of food I am lowering my review score.

Yen Sushi has top notch service and has maintained high quality food with lots of authentic options. It still remains my favorite place in town after all these years.

The dishes here scream "my first Thai" food.  All if their dishes are flavorless bastardized versions of real Thai food.   While they do have good and fresh ingredients, all of the 6 entrees we ordered tonight were undercooked and had little to no seasoning.   There are many other options in the valley that are far superior and hold true to the real quality dishes Thailand has to offer.   I knew something was up when they didn't let me specify how spicy my dish was going to be and just told me they could bring spices out afterwards for me to add to the food.   Well that's one major problem, cooking spices INTO the food is what makes food good. Not just throwing them On top of the dish afterwards.   The biggest disappointment was the tom yum soup. That is a staple dish that was lacking all of the flavor it's supposed to have.   There was no ganglia root, lemon grass or Kamir leaves in the soup at all.    It seemed that because they were busy that they had watered down their curry.  Another person at my table ordered the same curry dish as me and it seemed like they made one dish and then watered it down to spread it between both plates. The curry, which is a important dish to get right was not up to par.   The service wasn't bad but it wast great. Average.   The one thing that stood out was their meats. They had great quality and well cooked/cut/prepared meats.  But sadly, it seems they are afraid to season their meats as well.   Overall their food is just bland which is not something you'd expect if you've experienced real Thai good.   This place is "safe" Thai food. If you're afraid to try something ethnic or with unique flavors, this is the place for you.

Did a fast and good job, employees were extremely knowledgeable about the different products and offered good recommendations!  It's been about two weeks and the tint has all settled and it looks great!

Didn't properly wash two new expensive sweaters I had recently purchased. I asked specifically when I brought them there is they could handle it and they said yes. When I asked how they were washed the employee seemed to have no idea. He said they were washed in the machine, when the directions on the tag say hand wash or DRY CLEAN only.  So I figured a dry cleaners could do a dry clean and I assumed they would know how to treat fabrics without ruining them. But when I got my sweaters back they had lost lots of color, shrank and worst of all became fuzzy all over the place and now looks like a bunch of fuzz instead of hand sewn material...  When I called back, the employee said the owner is gone and I have to come by again tomorrow. I'll update more after that, I doubt there is anything they can do to fix these sweaters, I guess I"m just out hundreds of dollars now.  If you have really nice clothes with any type of special fabric, do not take them here. It seems they only know how to do dress clothes and that's it.
