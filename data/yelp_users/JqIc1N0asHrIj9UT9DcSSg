Just had dinner at this location with my boyfriend. The food was fine but we were really disappointed with the service. Worst waiter EVER! He looked very young and seemed like it was the first time he'd ever waited tables. We sat down, 10 mins later ordered drinks, 10 mins later got the drinks & ordered food, then about 15-20 mins later we got the food. The waiter dropped our tortillas on the floor. Everything was really shaky and drinks spilled over as they were served. It took about 10 mins to replace the dropped tortillas. The waiter kept apologizing to our table and all the tables around us. At one point we overheard him say to other guests "oops, I definitely just burned myself." In sum, it was a real shit show. I blame the restaurant management for employing that individual as a waiter without any training or experience.

Love love love having this great spot within walking distance! I go for the breakfast potatoes. Hands down the best I've ever had! Savory and spicy with a hint of sugar. Always browned to perfection. The house-made bagels and breads are a special treat. Also nice that they serve liquor if you want a bloody or mimosa with brunch. Great service and friendly staff. To-go orders are also super convenient.

Great atmosphere; big screen TVs, beers on tap, pool & darts. By far the best nachos in town! 4/5 stars because the employees are a bit odd and one time a female bartender was rude to me. It's still a fun spot though!

Hillside Spot is spot-on perfection!   First time visiting for brunch this morning & the experience was seamless from start to finish.   Super busy but the wait for a table was not super long.   My nonfat latte was a treat for the eyes & the taste buds! The El Jefe omelet with sourdough toast was a great combo of meat & veggies - not too heavy and perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend raved about his peach green iced tea & banana pancakes.   Our only note is our waitress took quite a while to bring our check at the end of the meal, but she was covering several tables.

We ordered the house fried rice & two chicken entr√©es. The fried rice was awesome! Chicken, pork & shrimp. Delish! We were a little disappointed that all dark meat was used. We ended up making our own chicken the next night and mixing it with the other ingredients. That tasted awesome.

Visited FATE for the first time last night. To put it simply, this place puts the FATE in fatal. "Micro" brewery should be taken very literally. It is a teeny tiny facility with a few tables and only two TVs. I went with the intention of watching a big football game but the bartender absolutely refused to change the station. The typical scottsdale dbag tending bar was extremely aloof and offered zero pleasantries. Upon assessing the first few minutes of my experience there I decided to take my business elsewhere. I look forward to seeing what opens in this location next & I have a feeling it will be very soon.

We love it! Stopped in for lunch today after golf and were seated immediately.  Drinks arrived promptly, along with chips, red & green salsa and bean dip. All delicious and fresh. I had the fiesta burro & my bf ordered the pick two. Scrumptious! We were very impressed. We have no complaints, and it is clear they all take pride in this restaurant.

Best place for an eyebrow wax!  I drive 45 minutes to the salon. I just can't go anywhere else. They all do a great job, but Sophia is super gentle.

This place is fantastic! I'm a supplement novice and the friendly staff has helped me get started step by step. Always willing to give advice and personalized attention. Just recently I walked in with my half-used tub of concentrated preworkout because I was concerned the powder was starting to look funky. They explained it was due to moisture getting in the container and switched it out for a brand new one with zero hassle. They also advised I keep the new tub in the freezer to avoid this happening again. They definitely understand how adhering to the fundamentals of business ethics and great customer service result in repeat customers. I'm impressed.

Oh man! So great. Can I give them 6 stars?? Friendly staff, casual atmosphere, incredibly delicious food, and fair prices. I got a chicken plate & my bf had the firehouse gyro. The plate came with a big greek salad, humus, pita, veggies and a drink. Tons of food. I couldn't even finish it with my bf's help so I happily packed my leftovers into a doggy-bag for later. We were making plans to come back before we even finished our meal!
