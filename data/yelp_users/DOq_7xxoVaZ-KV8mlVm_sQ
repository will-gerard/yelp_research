Good service, smiling faces, and the best food Denny's has to offer. Unlike most Denny's I have been to, I don't think anyone is on parole here.

Went in on a Thursday night. I ordered come rolls and they were very good, fresh, but on the tiny side for the price. I sat at the sushi bar and the chef was super nice and very attentive. The waitress I had was nice, but brutally slow. Maybe it was because she had too many tables, I didn't notice. I don't have a whole lot of patience when I am sitting alone.  The music was fun. When you hear Ice Cube's Today Was A Good Day, it's pretty awesome. The volume wasn't too loud either. Would I go back? Yes, but only if someone else is paying. I wish they carried Hana flavored sake. Fuji Apple...omg yum

Yeah...no. Don't give me a roll with canned salmon and pass it off as "baked salmon".  It was gross, tasted old and bad fishy. I told the waitress I didn't like it. She was nice about it and took it off the bill. The sushi chef was somewhat nice, but kept telling me that that roll was the most popular. Really...people eat that crap? It tasted like butt. He asked me to put up my plate so he could take the rolls off. I'm wondering if they were recycled. It tasted like it was already made and sat in the fridge all day anyways, so who knows. The other roll I had was ok. It just didn't taste fresh. We'll see how fresh it was or wasn't tomorrow morning. If you know what I mean. ;o)

Yeah, the parking lot is super sketchy. Whomever owns the strip needs to put in some damn lights.  I stopped next door to do some laundry and checked this place out. I'm wondering about the bed?? I didn't see one. Anyways...There was a college boy taking orders and also doing the delivery, so if you walk in ring the bell.  I ordered sweet and sour chicken, crab and cheese wontons, and egg drop soup. I think it was great. The chicken was crispy and didn't look questionable like it does at some Chinese takeouts, you know what I mean. The sauce was on the side also.  The people who are complaining need to realize this isn't suppose to be a sit down restaurant. What are you expecting? This is Chinese take out! I basically got two meals for 13 bucks. I would eat here again. Probably today!

I sat at the sushi bar, ordered a couple rolls, both were not good. The server was slow, people were screaming, and I was annoyed. I also got a charge on my bill for something I had not ordered. I notified the waitress and she took it off, but still. The decor was pretty, that's about it. I'm curious about all the raving reviews, which is the only reason I went here. Do people just not know what quality is, or am I just spoiled?

Went on a late Tuesday afternoon. I can't imagine what this place looks like on a weekend.  Wouldn't it make more sense to make one side for small dogs, and the other for larger dogs? If there was a scuffle, it wouldn't be a possible death sentence? Or if the larger dogs do run a little bit, my dog wouldn't get trampled and possibly break its leg? That is my one major complaint.  If you are on the passive side, why would you bring a ball and thrower, and have a 150 pound dog. That worries me a little and doesn't really suggest a passive dog. One bad jump, or one bite, and my dog is dead or seriously injured.   Also, why are the people so.... rude and unwelcoming? I felt like I was in grade school getting picked last for kickball. No, i am not from Scottsdale. I didn't bring Poopsie or a gigantic shiz wagon that drags me along by it's leash. I'm the new girl...oooooh. I literally had one lady come up to me, stare, then say "Are those dogs with you?" I say yes, she stares some more and then walks away. ??? I just stood there feeling like an a-hole. If I seen some girl come walking in with cute little dogs I would at least come up and BE FRIENDLY.  Yes it's large and somewhat clean, especially considering the sheer numbers of dogs there (some 4 to 1 person).  If you like crowds, then this is for you. I'm just not into being treated like a leper. Being around 25 dogs, and 12 snotty people that don't pay attention and use it as their social hour. The only thing this place is missing is a martini bar.

I've been there twice and I like it. I have three small chihuahuas and this past Friday afternoon was fantastic. I was hesitant because the area itself is pretty small and there were a lot of dogs, about 15? But they were the biggest group of well behaved dogs I have ever come across. The owners seem pretty attentive also. For some reason there are two fenced in areas that alternate between days. It would be cool if they would make one into a small dog area, but honestly if ever day is like the one I had on Friday, it would be unnecessary.

Wow. I just wish I could tell the people there on Monday at around 5-5:30, that you are lucky that I punched the fence and not your face.  What a nightmare. Most of the dogs there ran over mine, only one stepped up. Apparently her dog just likes to play with little dogs. Really, is that why your mutt attacked mine when we were in between the exit gates trying to leave?  It's ok, he just likes to play, right? I do have to give her some credit because at least she kind of tried (obviously not hard enough). Unlike ALL the others that just sat there. I saw two dogs take massive dumps and no one did anything. This was like a minefield of dump.Then I got the pleasure of stepping in a pile and squishing it into my Adidas. I asked if anyone cleaned their dogs shit, no response. But a couple with an ugly crap dog laughed. Another that repeatedly ran over mine and all they could say, "oh stop pickin on that dog" NOT BOTHERING TO REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM THE BENCH! It took all I had not to show them something that was really funny. My dog getting trampled and yelping and stepping in dog shit, not funny. Taking my poop shoe and rubbing it in your face....now that is hilarious. But I refrained. By the time I pulled that dog off mine (which was followed by someones stupid mouth) I thought, hit the fence out of sheer anger, or go to jail for beating someone? I chose fence. Not a peep came out of peoples mouths then. Don't let the blond hair and small dogs fool you, I will beat you down like your momma obviously should have.  If you got a big dog and it chases the little dogs and tramples them, do yourself a solid and CONTROL YOUR DOG. Because the next time, it could be mine that it trampled, and I'm out of free passes on that situation.

Ooooooooooooo I so love it here. Wednesday night DJ was frickin awesome. The place kind of breaths sex. It has bleachers! Devil art on the wall. Super sweet green and red lasers. It's kinda goth, kinda sorta a little gay. Sure it's not everyones cup of tea. But I thought it original with a good vibe, good music, good decorations, great sound system, clean, and just the right amount of weird to make it absolutely fantastic.

It's a smaller version. Same general selection of stuff, just not all the brands of a larger Walmart. You can zip in and grab a gallon of milk and not have to walk a mile. But if you want imitation crab meat, they don't have it. Bummer.

Well, I wasn't going there to buy a new phone or service. I needed tech help with my internet stick because they only seem to last 3 months. I was in and out within 10 minutes with a new stick . Mine decided to stop working spontaneously. I had a younger brown haired girl help me who was really nice and didn't try to BS me at all.

I give it one star for being able to cut in line because I was a cute girl alone. Which was so freakin ridiculous to just let certain people in and not others. Lines are for posers, let's me honest. The only way I would stand in a line is if the booze was free. I give it negative 1,000 stars because I got pushed about 10 times. I couldn't even get a drink because the bartenders apparently couldn't multi task. No one came up to talk to me. ( I'll leave that to the overall bad flavor I get from OTS). So I stayed until the girls potty line wasn't 10 miles long and ran for my life.

Dear Justin, spare me. Can you not make a comment if you work for the place? Can you not comment after a whole year? You need to get a life  buddy!!! People who are looking to go there want to know what it's like, hence yelp. I am from Michigan, and was visiting the Phoenix area. I have been all over the United States, so I can guarantee you I can "be pleased". This place is a nightmare period. Not for an adult who isn't filled with silicone or covered in nasty cologne and hair gel.
