This place is gross!!! Saturday night midnight plenty of people... Mostly couples and single men. I was with a male friend so we were a "couple".  The men were fat, old men, unattractive. And many that were non English speaking.. all Just staring into rooms and at woman as they walked by and then follow them.. No one dancing couples sitting alone, I've been to a few and nothing like this.. Better clientele, nicer Updated establishment. If I could give it a negative sign instead of even 1 star I would.

Never busy... Not sure how you choose interpret that. My son loves this place, gets the sesame chicken or orange chicken ... He thinks it's the best. I on the other hand not in love with this place. Honestly though haven't found a Chinese restraint that I do love. My decision is made on the hot and sour soup which the first time wasn't fantastic, the second time was better however still not the best. Which for me was in California. I don't care for their ping pong chicken which is plain fried chicken pieces with sauce poured over it. Chicken chow mien tastes like cheap hotel food. Freezer chicken -not fresh tasting. The fried rice is sticky steamed rice "fried" (heated up) in soy sauce.  So why do I come here? My son loves it and I enjoy his company. It's more bout the bonding. Not too mention the service is good, friendly n quick. The appetizers are decent and I can ask for my pot stickers to be soft and not deep fried, which I'm not a fan of. The price is reasonable as well.
