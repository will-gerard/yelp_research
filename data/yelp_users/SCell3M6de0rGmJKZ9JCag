I hired Crown Sedan for an hour, to transport my son and his new bride from his wedding venue to his hotel. The car was also then available to take other wedding guests from venue to hotel. The whole experience was excellent from start to finish. My initial communication with Martin (owner?) was clear, timely and helpful. I had shopped around for the service and car we anticipated and found Crown's rates to be very competitive. The driver, Tim was on time, very professional and kind. My son said his experience with the ride was just perfect. You couldn't ask for more, especially on such an important day. Thank you Crown Sedan!

This could be the coolest new (to me) place in town. I absolutely love when a business comes in and revives an old structure, preserving a bit of history, rich with story. I am sitting in the "Living Room" ...an old dentist's office/home where an eclectic mix of brick, concrete and mis-matched vintage and modern furniture come together to create a relaxed and inviting space to work or connect. I'm enjoying my iced Ginger Peach tea that was made fresh when I arrived. Very light and just what I was looking for. I also tried the cardamom coffee bread which was dense in a yummy way and perfectly laced with spiciness. Win,win,win! This is a wonderful spot for a shower or any kind of party or special event. I will be back again and again.

My first time in and it was just what I was looking for. It's a rainy day, so I jumped at the black bean chili. Richly flavored and chock full of beans and veggies that still had a nice crunch. My fresh veggie wrap was absolutely delicious. The hummus melded with the dill marinade into a yummy sauce for the crisp vegetables wrapped in a hearty spinach wrap. My tummy is very happy. Friendly, cheerful staff as well. This will certainly be one of regular spots.

I was drawn to this place because of the historical building and quite frankly, that's where the quality started and ended for my husband and I.   Service was very disjointed and food was average at best. I was particularly disappointed in my 8.00 cocktail which was their take on a Salty Dog (one of my favs) that tasted like watered down grapefruit juice from a mix. Other flavors promised were nowhere to be found.  They advertise using local farms... How about some Fresh squeezed juice?  Probably won't be back. I'd drive to Mexico first.

I really, really, really wanted to like this place and hope they can work the kinks out and stay in business. However, it's a long shot if they keep their current manager.   I've been here twice, once with my hubby on date night; looking for a romantic place to enjoy a glass of wine and some much needed convo. Manager sauntered over, had a seat in our cosy corner and proceeded to complain to us about his employees and how much more work that put on him! Well, you're the manger yo!  Next visit, I brought my family. We did not know ahead of time, but they were having a free wine tasting hosted by this same manager.  He wrongly assumed that we were wine newbies and arrogantly shared his vision to bring wine education to our community through his hand selected wine list... Which of course, wasn't the same wine list he would choose for himself. When not serving wine behind his wine barrel tasting station, he sat playing on his phone. Yikes!  I wish I could say the food made up for the poor experience, however the bruschetta (low cost, high profit item) we all shared, was flavorless. Hummus was the highlight.   Overall look and feel of the place is clubby and warm. Unfortunately, cheap table chairs, while nice looking, are uncomfortable.   Even though this place is needed and welcome in my neighborhood... They need to bump it up!
