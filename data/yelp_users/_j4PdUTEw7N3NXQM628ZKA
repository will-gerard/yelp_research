Meh.  Just meh.  OK - maybe Dim Sum is something special, but random Tuesday night menu fare is not so good.  We spent way too much money for awfully bland food.  I mean, it wasn't BAD, it just wasn't great.  I can say we won't be going back to order off the menu...  I may give it another try for Dim Sum.  Maybe.

OK - so since my last review, I have been to this place like 20 times.  I thought it was just ok - but really - it's much better than that.  AND - the staff there is really great.  The ladies at the counter remember me and are super friendly.  Again - I'm not sure it's the best Chinese Food I've ever had - but for the money and feel of the place - it's great.  Best thing on the menu - Hot and Sour Soup.  OMG it is so freakin' delicious.

Made our way here last night for my Birthday Dinner.  THANK GOD.  I have been looking for a restaurant like this since I left Chicago 5 years ago.  The style was perfect, the prices were not exorbitant, the food was delicious, the service was tremendous.  We had a table at 7, and even though we Happy Hour had passed, they still let us order off of the happy hour menu, so we had four courses for $30 a piece.  We started with Spinach Artichoke DIp, each had a salad (I had the Bacon/Bleu Cheese/Walnut - YUM), then I had the Balsamic Ribeye...  It was so delicious.    One complaint, half of my steak was medium, a quarter was rare, and the other quarter was practically blue, but it still tasted great.  Oh - and the carrots were a little too sweet for me...  They tasted like sweet potatoes....  Anyway...  For dessert we had the bread pudding which was the best damned bread pudding I have ever had.  Add in the drinks (which were tasty) and our bill was still nothing too crazy.  Our server was just the right combination of hands off and hands on, and i dug her big time.  We ended up having a long leisurely meal, were there from 7-9, but it didn't feel like we were there a long time.  It was just a nice relaxing meal...  Loved it - best restaurant experience I've had since I moved here three years ago.  Can't wait to go back.

Love this place.  Almost every one of our animals (3 cats and 3 dogs) have been here for one emergency or another since we moved here 8 years ago.  Yes, sometimes we've had to wait a while (not nearly as long as I've waited at a Human Emergency Room, mind you) and yes it's not cheap (because it's emergent onsite services).  However, they are friendly, helpful, clean, and caring, and I will continue to come back again and again (although i kinda wish I didn't have to but then my animals are danger-prone).  Thank you for all you do!

I SOOOO wanted to love this place.  We used to have this great Jamaican place around the corner in Chicago, and were really looking forward to those flavors.  They were very attentive when we arrived, and I thought, this will be swell.....    Then we met our server.  This place is not very big and our server, who didn't seem to know what he was talking about (how's the fish, it's yummy.  how's the short ribs, so good.  not helpful), was LOUD.  He seemed really overworked which I cannot understand because there are only like 10 tables in the whole place and there were others working...  Starter - we had the Prawns and Roti.  They were amazingly good.  One criticism - when they say prawn, they just mean bigger than average shrimp. I understand this is common in certain areas of the US and the rest of the world, but the starter was slightly different than we expected.  Nonetheless, it tasted amazing.  We had the rum punch of the day to drink - VERY tasty.  I would go back just to have the "prawns" and rum punch.  Dinner - I ordered the short rib stew - their take on a beef stew, essentially.  It was VERY tasty.  Really, I could've eaten more.  No really.  I wish they had given me more.  The portion was smaller than I expected for the price.  The flavor was nice - and spicy - and amazing - but I still hadn't tasted anything that reminded me of the Jamaican food I had back in Chicago.  I know that doesn't necessarily mean anything, but...  Todd had the Mussels.  These should really be on the starter menu.  I'm not sure how someone can make a meal out of 10-15 mussels.  There's no side and two small pieces of bread.  Again, for the price, it seemed strange.  Also - while the mussels were tasty and wonderful, they were larger than normal, and neither of us cares for the larger mussels.  We were not thrilled, and for a birthday celebration, it was underwhelming, but we had a nice time (because the company was good).  I'm just not sure our experience was worth the money we spent.

Thank god we finally found a good sushi place in Phoenix.  I thought it would never happen.  We had the Heart Attack, the Calamari Tempura Roll, The Rattlesnake, Soft Shell Crab, and a couple of Kirin.  OK.  The Heart Attack is amazing.  I mean, seriously.  It's like everything that is good about Jalapeno Poppers and everything that is good about a good roll all mixed up into one.  While the Calamari Tempura and the Soft Shell Crab Rolls were good - they always are - the Rattlesnake was the best.  I have a secret love for Freshwater Eel, but this roll capitalized on it and it was tremendous.    I do kinda wish we had gotten there before 5 or after 8 so we had been able to take advantage of Happy Hour - every day from 3-5 and 8-close (cuz they have $5 rolls and drinks!) but, even though we spent more than we wanted, it was well worth it.    I will DEFINITELY be going back.

Seriously!?  I, for the life of me, cannot figure out why this place is rated so high.  AND.  Reviews actually say the best around?  Then you don't get out much.  Listen.  It isn't horrible.  But it is certainly the Denny's of sushi joints.  Service was friendly.  Sesame seaweed was a perk because no one seems to serve it anymore.  Veggie tempura was dripping grease.  And.  There are five thousand different sushi rolls that all sound and taste the same!  We had soft shell crab roll, shrimp with eel, and spicy tuna with cilantro.  The cilantro was a GREAT addition, but the tuna was fishy and strangely colored.  Soft shell crab wasn't terrible, shrimp and eel was really fishy.  I do not believe the Rolls were rolled correctly as they just fell apart. I'm sorry, but I was unimpressed, and we won't be returning.  Again, super friendly people, and neighborhood joint atmosphere cannot make up for food, in my opinion.

We were in the mood for calzones - so we tried somewhere new - and were very happy!  I will DEFINITELY be returning to try the pizza next.  Not very expensive, and right down the street from me.  ONE NOTE: The sauce that comes with the calzone had meat in it - wasn't expecting that.  I've only ever had a calzone served with marinara.  I liked it.  My vegetarian other half, not so much.

We search and search and search for good, inexpensive chinese food, and I think we have finally found it.  So far, the food has been great.  Not TERRIBLY impressed with the shrimp Mei Fun, but I think it's just because it wasn't what we were expecting.  The Singapore Noodles are AMAZING, egg rolls are great, and they have the best hot and sour soup (which has no meat) of any of the local places around here.  I understand the critics who say the food is bland - because most places put so much cloying, thick, syrupy gook on all of the food, one can't experience the freshness of the vegetables, and the simplistic cooking style that should go into these dishes.  They get it just right, in my book at this place.  YUM.  Will definitely go back.
