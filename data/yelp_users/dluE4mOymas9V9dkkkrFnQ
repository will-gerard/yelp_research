Hands down the best restaurant I've been to in Arizona. Sure, he doesn't have filet mignon or serve the finest wines/liqours, but Randy (the owner) is the type of guy who makes you feel at home. He really takes care of you, and he forms a personal connection with all of his customers (he just wished me a happy birthday on Facebook and said my next dog is on him). And he won't turn you away if you're not a Steelers fan, he'll still welcome you with open arms! The service is just the tip of the iceberg though; even though it's a 'hot dog joint', all of Randy's ingredients are local, and you can taste the difference. I go here all the time, and I encourage all my friends and family to do the same. Out of everyone I've brought, they've all been back at least once, or are wondering when we're going back again. My favorite thing on his menu is the "Eddie R" pulled pork sammich. One of the best I've ever had, so good that my friend that doesn't even like pulled pork orders it from time to time! Try this place out, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed, one of Chandler's best-kept secrets!

This place is great! Very friendly staff that make you feel at home. The food is pretty good, with some different menu items, like their bacon bleu chips or their pig wings. I go here all the time for happy hour after work, and we are never disappointed.

If given the choice, I will never use OnTrac again. I have ordered hundreds of times from Amazon, and the only time I have issue is when they ship via OnTrac. They sit on packages and just never deliver them, eventually returning the item(s) to Amazon without it ever moving beyond 'shipment left the facility' status.
