Horrible experience two weeks ago on a Saturday!! I went in before 9 pm and the entrance by the produce had no carts available. I told a lady by the self checkouts, older with short brown hair who looked like a manager, that there weren't any carts around and when I walked to the other entrance they locked the doors to only keep one side open. She told me I would have to go out to the parking lot and find my own cart. I had to walk to the other side of the parking lot to get my cart and saw many other customers having to do the same thing. They were clearly open for business and I didn't see one employee my entire shopping visit. The self checkouts were all that was open and there was a long line. There was an employee who was in charge that had a "I'm in training" ribbon on his name tag. He was frantically running around to each self checkout to help people and check ID's for alcohol. After I checked out and walked away I noticed that my receipt didn't print. I asked him to help me and he told me to wait. The line continued to get longer and other customers were getting angry. After standing in the middle of the checkouts for 10 minutes I asked for a manager. None in sight. The phone at customer service was ringing off the hook and another female employee was yelling over to the man at checkout saying "I don't know how to answer the phones and I don't want to get in trouble." I walked over to her and asked for the manager and she said that she couldn't find him and he wasn't answering their pages. When he finally showed up and I asked him to reprint my receipt he said that wasn't possible. Now I was severely angry. He said if he took my information down MAYBE someone would call me in the morning but it was unlikely. Fry's clearly has VERY poor management on staff who #1. Have poor scheduling (why would anyone schedule the new person to be alone on a Saturday night?) #2. They are understaffed #3. The customer service from the manager named John was non existent. If the general manager isn't aware how terrible their store is being run into the ground they have a rude awakening. I would be shocked if I am the only customer who shared their absolutely horrifying experience from that night. Not only did I do personal shopping at this Fry's, I also shopped here for my business. I will now be taking my business elsewhere for both my own and my businesses sake. If I wanted crappy service I would have gone down the street to wal mart!

Came here this morning for a smoothie mid-morning. There were a few people sitting down with their food/smoothies and I could tell one guy was standing and waiting around for his order. There were three employees working at the time. I walked up to the counter and nobody acknowledged me. The employees were frantically running around not paying attention. Finally, what seemed to be the manager looks up a few minutes later and says "we will be with you in a few minutes folks." I look behind me and there are now about 10 people waiting behind me to order. Minutes go by and he comes over to take everyone's order in line. I was the first person in line to order. He gets through the huge line of orders but there isn't anyone making smoothie orders as they come in. When he's finished taking orders he starts to make the smoothies but he wasn't making them in the order he rang them up in. I saw people in line behind me get their orders before me. I asked an employee if they called my name already and I missed it. I overheard her asking the manager and he rudely said he was backed up.  When he called my name when my smoothie was ready I said thank you and he just handed it to me and walked away. Poor customer service and the manager had a terrible attitude. If that's the way he treats his customers and staff during a rush he's clearly in the wrong business. Took over 30 minutes to get a smoothie when I was the first one in line!

Decided I wanted to try out reflexology and looked on Google maps for one nearby. This hidden gem is practically in my back yard and couldn't believe I've never heard of it before. I looked on their website and found that they offer a huge discount for your first session. Made an appointment an hour after I called. The woman at the front desk was extremely nice and attentive. There was another man waiting to take his first massage and she gave us both an introduction about what to expect. She was extremely detailed and it was nice knowing what to expect during my massage. I did the 90 minute and it was AMAZING. She applied just the right pressure and hit spots I didn't even know were tense and hurt. She was working so hard she was getting a workout. I don't know how she only had two hands because it felt like she had tons of hands. I was so relaxed and at ease I never wanted to leave. I will definitely be returning. I want to go back tomorrow!

Brought my yorkie for the first time last weekend and had a great experience! I really procrastinated about getting him groomed and I knew he couldn't wait any longer. I called on a Wednesday to check their availability and they had an opening Saturday at 1:30 pm which worked perfectly with my schedule. I called a few other dog groomers before I found Fancy Fur n Purr and was turned off for multiple reasons (many were chains) 1. They were booked a week in advance 2. They required a drop off between 7-8 am and wanted me to leave my dog there for 4-6 hours. This made no sense to me. I discovered Fancy Fur n Purr on Yelp and figured a local business would most likely be a better option for both myself and my dog. I was impressed with how caring Julie was when I arrived. I could tell she loved her job and loved dogs. My dog was her last client for the day and let me know he would be done in less than 2 hours. When I came back to pick him up his haircut looked great! I forgot how cute he looked when he was groomed. I was very impressed to see that he wasn't in a cage when I arrived, he was on a leash in the room playing with another dog. This made me very happy to see that they let him hang out until I got there. Julie gave me a full report and said he did very well. I found out that other dog groomers (many large chains such as Petsmart) do not dry the dogs themselves - they put them in a CAGE that has dryers inside of it. I couldn't believe I never knew this. She told me it takes a long time for the dogs to dry in the cages (hence leaving your dog 4-6 hours). I'm so happy I found Fancy Fur n Pur! I highly recommend taking your dog for all of their grooming needs. Ask for Julie, she's great! Thank you Julie! Tegan loves his new haircut!

It REALLY bums me out when a restaurants food is ruined my horrible customer service. Sadly, this restaurant isn't even on my "I'll just get the food because I like it and expect the service to suck" lists. Not even worth it. I called in an order to go and I was told 15 minutes or less. I arrive around 15 minutes later when it should be ready and the girl at the counter 1. Didn't acknowledge me, 2. Was in the way of everyone else who was busy doing their jobs 3. Was preoccupied with standing at the counter texting on her cell phone. I mean, really? I'm actually surprised none of the other employees told her to get off the phone and work because I could tell they were having to pick up some of her slack. I finally get her attention and say that I have an order for pick up and she says "you'll need to wait." Just like that, with a bad attitude and an extremely unwelcoming facial expression at that. So I take a seat next to the counter to wait. Mind you the place isn't busy. There's one couple waiting for a booth to open but there were many places to be seated. After waiting for about 10 minutes I stand up next to the counter and again, not acknowledged. I ask her if she could check to see if my order was ready (she didn't even ask my name when I originally arrived) and STILL texting on her phone says to herself "oh I didn't check you out." A woman who seemed to be the manager asks me what I ordered, told me it was ready and gave my bag of food to the cashier. As I was grabbing my money she got back on her phone texting AGAIN. Her being young and society's technology is no excuse. I can't believe she wasn't coached on proper customer service etiquette and extremely surprised that the management staff allows you to be on your phone while dealing with customers. Needless to say, this was extremely irritating. Didn't get an apology from anyone and the cashier didn't even thank me after I had paid. Sheesh, be warned. Can't stand the hassle of poor service even if the food is good!

I am SO glad I found Brittany when I moved to Arizona. She always listens to my concerns and has helpful recommendations. She's the only hairdresser I've found that I trust 100%. I've always left the salon with exactly wanted and more. Brittany always goes above and beyond! I've had the best haircuts, hi lights, treatments and styles by her. I'm constantly getting complements on my hair. She's so friendly and comfortable to talk to is enjoy going to see her to chat too! I'm always recommending people to see Brittany at Mint Salon. I love the atmosphere at Mint and I know how hard finding a hairdresser as valuable as Brittany is. Make sure to schedule with her in advance! She gets booked up but it's because it's worth it!

Love this place! Started working across the street a few weeks ago and I find myself in there a few times each week. I'm addicted to their smoothies. The owners are a husband and wife and they are fantastic. A great couple that you can tell truly care about their customers and are fun to talk to.

This is my favorite place to go get a fresh pressed juice, fruit bowl and protein bowl. I love the atmosphere and it always looks well kept. The service, however is another issue. There's a man with dirty blonde hair that works there that seems like he does not know what he's doing. I always love taking friends and family here but each occasion he's done something to mess things up. I went with a few friends one night and he brought out the order. There were 5 times we had to send him back to get things he forgot. He didn't even realize he forgot 3 of my friends food. It was frustrating and he ended up giving one of them a free drink and made the other go in to pay for hers. I took my mom here for Mother's Day and he brought out someone else's drink order then ended up letting us have that and the ones we ordered. We asked for another bowl and when he went to get it he was gone for 5 minutes. My mom went in and asked him again and he said he forgot. It was pretty sad when my mother commented to me that he was so zoned out it was like he was on drugs. It's nice when we got the free drink but since this has happened numerous times chop shop is going to go out of business from all the free stuff they give away from making brainless mistakes.

I got a "virgin card" before Tokyo joe's opened where you get a free meal your first and 5th visit. I decided to give it a try and ordered a build your own bowl for take out. The lady who took my order on the phone was great! She was very helpful and had an upbeat and positive attitude. When I got to the restaurant, the cashier who rang me up handed me a receipt and said they would call my name. I sat down and waited for over 15 minutes (when I was told my order would be ready less than 10) and saw many customers who came in after me and ordered to go in the restaurant get their food. The same cashier who rang me up was close to me and kept making eye contact but never said anything to me. How he was so oblivious that I was waiting for an order was beyond me. I finally went back up to the counter and there was a woman who looked like the manager talking to another cashier. I handed her my receipt and asked if  she could check on it because I had been waiting quite awhile. Turned out my bag of food was sitting behind the register the ENTIRE time, prior to my arrival. She quickly grabbed the bag and said "sorry" without paying attention to me. The other cashier who is a male with tattoos and gauged ears actually apologized sincerely and he wasn't the one helping me!!! They obviously need a lesson in customer service and the man who actually sounded like he cared needs to have a manager title. It would have been nice for the manager to ask if there was anything else she could do for me. Heck, I would have been happy with a free drink. I'm glad my meal was free with the coupon I brought in, otherwise I would have been even more angry. Aside from my food being cold when I got home it was delicious and a large portion size. Going back here won't be on my agenda anytime soon.

I reviewed a message from the manager, Dawn, less than 24 hours from my first visit apologizing about the situation. I think it's great when a manager can admit to faults and grow themselves and their team from mistakes. I was not expecting her to reach out to me or invite me to come back for a great experience. I understand that mistakes happen and they are all teachable moments, it just depends on the accountability and ownership and their actions to rectify moving forward. I have accepted her invitation to come back and look forward to the great experience she guarantees I will have.

I had my first appointment with Denise today. She is AMAZING!! When I checked in they were unable to find my reservation in the system at 1:30pm that I had made online. I frantically checked my email for the confirmation I was sent and come to find out my appointment wasn't until the following day. I showed up to the salon an entire day early not even realizing the date and forgetting that I made my appointment for Sunday, not Saturday. I was so embarrassed and couldn't believe I did that but Denise was SO nice to me. She pulled me back to her chair right away and asked what I was looking for and if I drove far. Even though she was completely booked and had 2 other clients with color processing she said she would be able to do my partial highlights right then instead of me having to come back the next day. She made me feel like I was the only client she had at the moment - I never felt like I was a burden or that I had inconvenienced her or the staff, even though it was my mistake. She is very professional and extremely skilled. She did my highlights quickly not because she was rushing or that she wasn't being precise, it is due to her experience, skill and craft. She knows what she is doing! I've seen so many stylists during my lifetime and have never understood why they take hours with foils. Thankfully I have found Denise! I could tell how much she values and appreciates her clients, respects their time and is working because she's passionate about what she does. Her salon is beautiful and I was impressed by my entire experience. I am looking forward to coming back again and I will absolutely be referring my friends. Thank you Denise!

So grateful for Dr. Garst! I met Dr. Garst and his wife, Karissa through the Gilbert Chamber. I had been to a chiropractor once before and didn't have the same experience as I've had at The Well Chiropractor Clinic. I had no idea how beneficial Chiropractic care is and how important it is to find a good doctor. Dr. Garst is AMAZING! He was very thorough my first visit and made a detailed treatment plan for me. I have been suffering from joint pain due to lupus & RA and haven't had relief until I began seeing Dr. Garst for frequent adjustments and therapy. I've been able to tell when something feels wrong and Dr. Garst has fixed it every single time. I look forward to my appointments because I get so much relief! I love that I'm supporting their small family business in Gilbert. Not your typical chiropractor! Definitely worth making an appointment! Scheduling is always easy. Karissa books my appointments in advance so I can get the times that work best for me on a recurring basis. If I ever need to schedule an extra visit during the week they are very flexible and have always had a same day or next day availability. Highly recommend Dr. Garst! My pain has significantly decreased because of his help! His wife, Karissa, who manages the office has always provided exceptional customer service and is very compassionate and caring. I always feel so comfortable when I go into the office and walk out feeling comfortable in my own skin! Thank you Dr. Garst & Karissa!!
