This is one of the worst companies I've ever dealt with. I called them on a Sunday for a leak that we had from a line in the attic at our rental property. They called me back and smoothly said Sure, no problem, we'll be there first thing tomorrow morning. The tech called me at 7:44am the next morning, and began badgering me about how bad of a problem it was, it's all the tenants fault for not changing the filter, etc. and ranting about how it will cost me $800 to fix the coil in the attic, it needs an acid wash, etc.   I arrived there 20 minutes later, took a look at the filters (they weren't even that dirty), and based on that and his abuse, said no thanks, I'm not going to do it. He started to challenge me on paying for the service call, and when I said sorry, you'll have to bill me for it, he looked defeated and walked out the door.   I called another company (one I've dealt with before), and they fixed it for $195.   DON'T get suckered into using these guys, they were bullies, and pretty dishonest. I'll never use them again.

I had never been to the Roaring Fork before, but I was excited to try it, based on the recommendations from friends and family.  I was pleased with our meal - we had a variety of items, and all were very well done. We loved the heirloom tomato salad with goat cheese and arugula. This was probably our favorite thing. We also tried the lamb chop fondue, which was very good, but a little difficult to eat. I'd still recommend it though.  We decided to split the Big Ass Burger, for which I am glad, since it was huge, and it came with fries. This item was so memorable, since I loved the poblano pepper on the burger. Since we were splitting, we also ordered the green chili mac and cheese. This was delicious! I'll definitely try it again.  Very courteous wait staff, and very nice ambient room. I can't wait to go back for half-priced appetizers!

Just had my first lunch at Green, and I'm completely stuffed, and deliriously happy! The food is awesome, and I kept forgetting that it was all Vegan! I had the black jack pita, which was great. They added artichokes to the wrap, and it was filling and had tons of great flavor. The only thing I didn't get was the thyme fries. I didn't taste the thyme. That being said, I didn't go there for the fries. James shared his Big Wac with me, and I wished I had ordered the same. It's all in the sauce, it tastes like a real-deal Big Mac.   To drink, I wanted to try their Berry Lemonade, and it was the perfect summer drink. I also tried the Lime. Very tasty, and not as sweet as the lemonade. I'll get that one again for sure. For our after lunch treat, we shared a Peanut Butter bar, and an incredible Tsoynami shake. Both were amazing, we were impressed at how well each item was prepared. I need to take better care next time, because I could very easily pack on the pounds at this place.  I will definitely go back to this place. Hopefully next week!

The menu for this restaurant is pretty standard Greek food, but still really tasty. The original gyro is awesome, and they overfilled my pita sandwich with meat. Yum! They use fresh ingredients each day. Their hummus was awesome, just a little bit spicy, but not hot. The pita was hot, soft and fresh. The combo meals come with either fries or a side salad, and both are awesome. They season the fries with a little bit of something yummy that I couldn't identify.  As the other folks mentioned, the service at this place is amazing. The owner is the sweetest guy, so friendly and helpful, and offered to help me walk my to-go order out to my car, since my hands were full. He shook my hand, asked for my name, (and then called me by my name!) and invited me to come back. You can't get more endearing than that.  I'll definitely go back to this place again.

Butter & Me makes the most delicious and beautiful cupcakes! Her buttercream with chocolate cake cupcakes are my most favorite of all. The frosting is light and delicious, and has the perfect balance of not-too-sweet, not-too-strong flavor. I have dreams about this frosting, it's just that amazing.  Every time I call Kelly for an order she's ready to accommodate me, and on several occasions has gone out of her way to help me get a delivery to a client.   I definitely recommend Butter & Me cupcakes for a special event, thank you gift, or client gift, you won't be disappointed. They work very hard to make sure their creations are beautiful and packaged nicely, so they'll be perfect for your recipient.  Delicious, beautiful, and professional, I absolutely keep these cupcakes as my impress-me hat trick!

This is a really wonderful place! I loved the clever table set up, it felt authentic and fun. The wait staff was very knowledgable, and gave us some great recommendations. The only drawback was the wait time. I guess good food takes a while to bake.  I had the meat and cheese pasty, and it was amazing. Gooey, cheesey, and lots of yummy porky meat. That red wine gravy was tops.   Will definitely go again, and will bring friends back.

We were so excited to try FnB. We had a fantastic business dinner here, and reserved this place based on recommendations from friends.  We weren't disappointed.  The appetizer salad we had was a combination of  watermelon, cucumbers, pine nuts, corn nuts, feta, cilantro, with a very light vinagrette. It sounded bizarre, but it totally worked.  The lamb manti, though, was transcending. All I can say is that it's over the moon fantastic. We all loved it. Imagine small little lamb packets topped with a light cream, and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds. Amazing.   I had the pasta with heirloom tomatoes, and wow, the pasta was done right. The tomatoes were also divine, super sweet, and full of flavor. Amazing olive oil as well, I could have had a few more bites of just the oil and bread. Or twenty.  My husband had the hailbut, and it was perfection. Perfectly well cooked without being dry. The only thing I would have liked more was....more.  The wait staff was top notch, highly professional and very courteous. This is always a test for me. I loved each of their manners.  Can't wait to go back to this wonderful gastro pub!

Today I'm totally impressed with BLD. We went to lunch as a team, as a celebratory event for one on our team who's been with us for a year. Five of us ordered, and two of us had the server come out to ask us to pick different entrees, because they had run out of both of the items that we had ordered. They genuinely felt bad that we had to order some different things, so they gave us TWO complimentary desserts, which were phenomenal!  They tried to up their service, because of the inconvenience. I was impressed at how much they worked to be attentive and orderly. Wow!  For my entree, I wanted to try the Mediterranean Tuna salad, but I was one of those that had to order something else, so I chose the Grilled Portabello Salad, and it was very tasty.   Try the Dirty Chai, one on our team ordered this and raved about how delicious it was.

Planet Sub is great! Definitely stop in if you're sick of your usual sub shop. Tons of interesting menu items, including a From the Sea section, and some Low Carb options. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I had the Mega Roast Beef sandwich, and the Greek Wrap on two different days, and both were amazingly delicious. They offer the option to toast your sandwiches, and both times I had them toasted, and they were perfect - warm and not too crunchy. The prices are good, and they also do a great job in making party trays.  This location will be introducing breakfasts very soon.

We tried The Spot for lunch, and it was just eh. At the end of the meal, it reminded me more of like a short-order restaurant.  We ordered the Spot sandwich (a plain chicken sandwich with mediocre quality bun), and a chicken salad. The best part of the salad was the little piece of apple cinnamon bread that came on the side. Otherwise, it was little more than salad with deli turkey/ham in it, and some walnuts.   The seating was uncomfortable, and there's only 2 tables inside downstairs, and 1-ish up the stairs. Not great for summer eating in AZ. We ended up outside. The misters helped a little, but it was disappointing that most of their seating is outdoors.  The dessert case looked pretty good, but not good enough to make me want to try it.   I doubt we'll go back, it wasn't even compelling enough for me to write this review on the same day we went.

We tried this new place last week for lunch, and it was amazing! The food was awesome, and this place gets high marks in my book for decor. They uncovered the original, historic brickwork, washed it down (since it had been covered up with drywall), and it looks beautiful. It's a perfect fit for this country-down home-western themed restaurant. The rest of the decor is rustic, and there's lots of exposed wood. They also kept the original, historic metal ceiling tiles. Gorgeous!  Ok, back to the food. We tried the special of the day, the Green Chile chicken chowder, which was amazing. The other special was the Grilled Meatloaf sandwich, also delicious. But what really won us over was the Corn Bread with Orange BUTTER! Oh my goodness, this was a treat. Definitely worth a try.   We also tried the mac and cheese that came as a side, and it was great. It had a little spice to it, which kept it interesting. Very, very cheesy, the best kind. You could tell they put a lot of work and attention into this menu.  Can't wait to go back. It's an awesome addition to the downtown Chandler area, and I hope they get lots of support.

Just tried this place for lunch today, and this is definitely a place that I'm eager to talk about.  The decor is fresh and clever, and you can tell they put a lot of time and thought into making it look interesting and approachable. They win a big thumbs up in  cleanliness and decor categories. I would very much enjoy bringing friends here for lunch. (Cute little details, like the purse hangers on each table, and a fresh daisy made our meal even more enjoyable.)  For lunch I tried the shrimp and sweet potato hash protein bowl. The hash was incredible, I highly recommend trying it. The shrimp was very good too, but the thing that I loved was that they didn't just give me 4 shrimpy pieces - my bowl was full of shrimp and veggies. An ideal meal!  I ordered one of the fresh lemonades, and it was kinda good, but I found it lacking in a bit of flavor, plus it was super-sour.   Overall a great place that's off the beaten Mill Ave path, a good place to bring friends, or clients, and a menu that includes tons of healthy options. Can't wait to go back to try the smoothies, and their breakfast menu!

Absolutely wonderful place! I love this location, the genuine staff, the amazing food. The interior isn't what you'd call amazing but the fact that it's an old bank turned into a tasty restaurant somehow makes me happy. It has quaint charm.  We ordered four times, no joke. I tried the Cubana, and the bean and cheese empanadas. Then for dessert, we ordered not one, not two, but three of the fig, mozzarella, and dolce de leche empanadas. Oh my. They were incredible. I never would have put that flavor combo together, but it worked so well. So delicious, we all loved it.  The papas fritas were so delicious. Whatever that dipping sauce was is amazing. Will definitely go again, and order everything.

I just tried this new place for lunch today, since I'd seen people on FB talking about it, and I was in the area. Based on all the info, it sounded like an awesome new healthy-eating cafe, so I was eager to check it out.  The Cutting Board didn't disappoint. They haven't even had their grand opening yet, but it's open as of now, as a soft-open. I chatted with one of the workers, and she recommended that I try the "bb burger" - black bean patty, with delicious, crisp veggies on a wheat bun. It was awesome, I'm so glad I tried it! It also came with a side of house-made salsa, and blue corn chips, which was also delicious. The salsa was flavorful without being knock-you-out spicy.  I also sampled a bit of the hummus trio appetizer plate- the original hummus was my favorite, awesome flavor. All of the hummuses seemed a thick and on the dry side for me, but otherwise I liked the it. Loved the TONS of fresh veggie sticks that came with the hummus trio.  I also ordered the chocolate raw cake - it was a very rich chocolate torte, made of nuts and other all raw ingredients. I couldn't finish it, it was so rich. But amazing flavor, I loved it. Very chocolatey, awesome flavor. The crumbly chocolate crust made it feel like a chocolate cheesecake. I'd definitely order that again.  I can't wait to go back, and try all of their baked items someday. Also, the breakfasts sound really great. They have some amazing flavors of teas, as well.   If you're looking for some healthier options in the East Valley, you can't go wrong with this place. I hope the restaurant does fantastic, we need more places like this!

Solidly good Thai food. We are so excited to have a good Thai restaurant nearby! Our first experience was an order of take-out, and we had the red chicken curry (medium), and the chicken pad thai. Both were really good. I thought the chicken in the pad thai was really tender and juicy.   The staff was very friendly and offered some good recommendations.   We will definitely be ordering from here again.
