Go here a lot and make it a dinner and movie stop. Service here is always terribly slow! Food is okay at beat but the horrible service ruins the food! Only go if you don't mind waiting forever!

Awesome food, awesome price. I found this place by accident but quickly realized what a gem it was. The sushi is more than reasonably priced. The service is awesome. I've become a regular, service like this is HARD to find. Youre treated like a valued customer, which is something that is rare in this day and age. If you want awesome sushi, even better service and keep some money in your wallet, I definitely recommend you try this place.
