It's a great sushi restaurant in a little strip mall. They do have many alternative dining choices if you don't like raw fish, like my wife. Atmosphere is nothing special but pleasant. Food is very good,not great and sushi is a 7 out of 10. Portions are excellent and prices are fantastic making this my go to for sushi.

Is it the best sushi in town? No, but it's very good, friendly staff, great sushi chefs and it's just a fun place. Not fancy but has a good feel and the sushi bar is best place to sit. Get the spicy scallops, blue fin tuna! Prices are great. I usually walk out for under $20 and always leave in a good mood.

This place is terrible!!!!! I mean terrible!!!! Ordered the matzo ball soup to go and it has absolutely NO flavor!! In fact they put grilled chicken in the broth??? Of course that tells you they don't make the broth (which tasted like soapy water).  Prob worst matzo ball soup I've had, just dumped it out!  Being Jewish, I'm ashamed this place is still in business!!!

This store is closing August 16th. Why??? Cause they never remodeled it, poorly run and tired.  This is going to hurt all the other tenants in this shopping center. Nice work AJ's, glorified food city

Wow! I just read a review from a day ago saying how unfriendly the staff (girl) was and we experienced the same thing!!!!!! My wife and I went there for a croissant and the two girls working there started fighting with each other right in front of us.  When ordering it felt like they were doing us a favor by allowing us to eat there. We live nearby and couldn't believe how unprofessional they were. My wife felt so uncomfortable we had to leave.  Plus..they really don't have much of a selection. Won't be returning!

They have a winning combination; good food, great atmosphere, large portions and very reasonable prices. Always consistent. Tip: try their deep dish pizzas, they are fantastic!

Fantastic service. My car had 2 flat tires (don't ask, nightmare) and discount didn't have the tires I needed in stock so I bought them from Benz dealership. And yes, they jacked up the price but was in a crisis. Discount was closing so I left my keys and they said they would do it first thing in the morning. The next day, I get there at 8:45am and the car was ready. Ivan was excellent and took great care of me and all the paperwork ready and keys in hand.  Discount tire always has the best service for tires, I don't go anywhere else.

Wife had to have earring jewel repaired and owner fixed on the spot while we waited without any charge. Very kind of him. Looked around while we waited and has some very nice pieces (diamonds).

Took our 14 month old son for his first haircut. Blanca did a terrific job and he didn't even cry. In fact, he liked it. Having child sit in a car and having cartoons on, really helps. Plus, they sanitize the seats, steering wheel, etc so kids don't get sick. That's a big bonus to see!

Went here for lunch. Really nice staff (young girl taking order and serving). Food is very good, not great. Excellent prices and is authentic not like BS places like Ajo Al's.  Nice family owned place

TarBlows!!!! I am not sure who is giving rave reviews of this restaurant but either they are friends with with Mark or simply do not know food?? My wife and I had reservations for 8pm and when we arrived, the manager tried to sit us at a bar high top. Are you kidding me?  With a reservation its simply standard to provide a table in the main dining area and not at the bar.  They did clear a table that had left and upon seating provided us with bread.  The bread obviously was store bought (my guess LaBrea) and had been sitting in a basket under the heat lamp.  Wife ordered his "famous" spaghetti and meatballs. While the meatballs were very good, the sauce was absolutely deplorable. I believe they use the pan drippings as the marinara sauce as it was extremely greasy, no taste and just simply a mess. I ordered the seafood chowder which at $25 is anything but seafood.  All they do is add a ton of butter and cream, sprinkle 4 mussels, and honestly tiny "bits" of seafood of salmon with corn, onion and that's about it.  Pathetic.  I have had much better at whole foods take out than that. Service was satisfactory nothing to write home about but not bad either. In conclusion, this establishment should be ashamed at the food they put out as there is simply "no care" about there product.    Keep to wine Mark, that's something you at least know little about!

Fantastic service and repair! I had a scrape down the back of my SUV (wife decided to close garage door down on it) and it wasn't pretty.  I walked in, got a quote which was reasonable, about average compared to all the other shops, and decided to use them.  I brought the car in on a Tuesday afternoon and done mid Friday even with ordering parts and bumber. Car was washed and cleaned inside & out. This will be my go to (hopefully never needed) shop again.

Great spot!!! Not fancy just really good food and terrific service. Greek gyro salad is fantastic but so is everything else. Don't let the outside of the place deter you, it's worth your time to come in!

This place is for white trash and just a pigsty!!!! Walked in...completely filthy, saw owner walk out (who also is the cook)in basketball shorts and swear dripping off his face serving food to the customers. So I was skeptical of course then I thought maybe I shouldn't be so critical.  Ordered food to go cause I just couldn't eat there.  Food: it's NOT BBQ!!!! Ribs- they are not even smoked but I think they boil them first then pour slop sauce over them. They immediately fell off the bone which is a poor indication on cooking process and meat was brown and mushy.  Rib tips- well that's what they call them which were just little nuggets of super dry meat. Pulled pork- no flavor and again tasted boiled. Red beans & rice- only think edible really. Coleslaw- typical grocery store quality. Dessert- 6 inch toll house flattened over cooked crap. . Felt like I was walking into a place in Podunk Tennessee. I guess it's a great for people who have poor taste in food and think Appleby's is high end. I have no idea how health dept doesn't  shut this sewer down. The worst excuse for "BBQ" what a waste.

Did a "staycation" at camelback inn and decided to check out the happy hour. It's packed!!! Recommend getting there by 6 to get a seat. Food: Shrimp cocktail - 3 U-8 shrimp nicely done but the cocktail sauce was like it came out of a jar 6/10 Burger- excellent flavor, cooked perfectly. 8/10 Onion rings- these are "Texas" style but the batter overwhelmed the onion and a tad greasy 6/10 Roasted beets- if you like bitter then you will really enjoy them. For myself, it was a little off putting. 7/10 Popovers- yes as everyone says they are that good 9/10 Carrot cake w ginger ice cream- buttery, rich, a bit heavy. 2 bites is enough 8/10 Service- one bartender for entire place on a Saturday doesn't cut it. So service is non existent 5/10  Would I return? For happy hour..absolutely. Wonderful ambience, terrific resort, quaint. Dinner...probably not.

Salty!!!!!! Ordered Greek gyros salad and it was so salty couldn't finish it. Came with just a little feta, not dresses and their sauce is just sour cream. Nice service, not good food

Owner Scott Conant should be ashamed!!  We, my wife and I, arrived and were seating at a nice window table per our request.  After that, its ALL DOWNHILL.  Server, some jackass who really could care less about being professional and more concerned about the table of 3 girls a few table away giving them free food all night. He finally arrived at our table about 5 minutes after being seated, took our cocktail orders and then....disappeared. He came back with our drinks 15 minutes later and blamed the "bartenders were backup up". Really? Because our martinis were warm when you served us which were very ordinary and especially at $15 per.  Busboy brought us bread which only one type was decent so we just asked for that only instead. Waiter "I will make sure to get that out to you immediately" That never happened.  Food:  Heirloom tomato with Burrata- meh! I know its very simple and the wife wanted it but was as if Olive Garden made it. Really nothing special and was not seasoned properly.  Polenta with morels- again meh! Average at best.  Spaghetti what he is known for- very good not great. Would I order that again, no.  Halibut- dry!   This place is a joke and we got duped!   Pedestrian Food, Awful Service, High Prices = Avoid!

Went here before the Coyotes game. Food is horrible!!! I mean horrible!!!  We (3 of us) had the "steak sandwich" which was barely edible. Parts you couldn't even chew threw it. Our server was nice and gave decent service.  Don't eat here, just grab a drink.

AWEFUL!!!  Food: burgers come on a bun that 3times too big and dry, a bun can really make the burger. Inside the burger is what you mom used to make as a kid, big old plump dry patty that 2 inches wide and 2 inches thick. Fries, thin soggy and cold as the must have just been sitting there for an hour rather than making fresh hot ones as a customer would expect. Price $10 for the burger but if you want fries...guess what that's $3 more. Also ordered farmers salad which was supposed to be a garden salad with lots of veggies. The issue is the top with canned corn and frozen vegetables. Are you kidding me? Dressing was store bought low end, the kind that you would see as a grocery store brand. Unetible!  Service: it's run by kids and they could really care less about how you are doing and pay much attention to you. Waitress asked "are you done?" which we replied yes and she just threw the bill down and walked away.  Decor: it's nice and should say swanky but that cannot make up for what a complete joke this restaurant is who could care less about quality or service. Also, note that this place is filthy, the floors have grease all over it and you will notice that when u sit down under your table.  For essentially $20 for a burger fries and soda, run away run far far away. This place wont last. Don't waste your time or money here. I honestly know that in and out is far better and that's fast food.

One word describes this place....COCOON!!  I'm 43 and when we went on a Friday for happy hour the average age had to be 70. Had one drink, actually nice pour, then left. Great for much older people, I will see u in 30 years.

Good food, family owned, priced right and overall a nice place to grab Mexican food at a reasonable price.  Better than those BS fake places like Ajo ALs or Macayo. This is simple, fresh and done right. Our good to place for wanting Mexican and budget conscience.

Awful! This is basically DQ on steroids. I asked the counter server about a few items which he had no idea about anything. Wife ordered chicken strip dinner $9 and it was essentially frozen Tyson chicken out of a bag, gross!!!! Fries were cold and soggy. I just got chili $4 for a little container and it was basically Wendy's. For $13 fast foot for 2 little items and crap food, it's a joke. Oddly, we looked around the place and noticed most diners were a bit obese, think it must be a place for mid westerners.  Won't ever be back, would rather go to habit burger or in-n-out or even McDonald's for that matter. This place is a joke.

No flavor!!!  This pizza joint is from the prior owners of NYPD pizza who sold and started this new place.  While its a decent price point there is no taste to it. Crust is mediocre and the sauce is just awful. It's like they opened a can of tomato sauce and dumped it on the dough. Meh!

So, here's the lowdown on chop and wok!! Do you go for the food? No, while it's not awful it's just very average. Very heavy and thick loaded w MSG. Do you go for the service? No. We waited 10 minutes at our table and nobody acknowledged us. So, you ask the bartender and he will say "I will find someone to help you" Do you go for ambience? No, it's let's say "eclectic" and if you look around the place is dirty. So why go? Well, it was a group of 6 of us and we had a good time. You know what to expect there, not much. But it's has a good tap beer selection, it's not pricey and you know you can't be critical of this establishment. It is what it is!!!

Seriously?????? People don't have a clue about food. You put up a cute interior that looks like the "Jetson's" cartoon and they will come regardless of food and service. Wife and I arrived on a Thursday around 9:30 and they put us on a wait list and said it would be 15 minutes. They call u by texting your cell. Problem was that after 40 minutes I went in to see what was going on and the host said he texted me 10 minutes ago. Well he wrote down the wrong cell # and said "oops, will put u back on the list". I told him "so for your mistake u want me to wait again?" He realized that wasn't right so he sat us. After we sat, the waitress greeted us 5 minutes later and we ordered coffee. Which btw, the little cue card on the table says the owner searches all over Costa Rica for the right coffee beans. Hmmm, then he must have went to Folgers plant located there cause it ain't nothin special. Again, 10 minutes pass and we get to order. I had a scramble and the wife had the corned beef hash. Trying to flag down our waitress for a coffee refill was difficult as she was more concerned on how she looked in her LuLu lemon yoga pants rather than on the customers.  Food arrives.  My scramble was slopped together overcooked dry and the potatoes are put in a mold to look fancy, not!  Wife's corned beef....in edible, tasted like it was sitting out for hours & extremely sour. Waitress never bothered to ask how the meal was or thank you, just put check on table. $30 for 2 pathetic excuses for food and 1 "mystery" coffee. We got duped!!!!!  Be wise and take a stand, no more eating at places just cause it looks "cool".  Yeah.. I guess u could say I was pissed writing this review. In closing Snooze, is the correct name for it..snooze.

Wish I could have reviewed the food but last Thursday we stood at the hostess table around 5:45pm and nobody was around. We stood there for at least 5 minutes and even saw what appeared to be the manager and someone else who works there at a large table nearby just talking. The place was empty as well, there's no excuse for poor service let alone "no" service. So we walked out and went to stone and vine.  Wow!

Great pizza concept. Quality ingredients and you can choose whatever toppings you want and it's the same price just under $8. It's a 10 inch and just about right for one person. Nice staff and recommend this place. Is it the best pizza ever? No. But it's pretty damn good.

Wow! I didn't expect that!! Thought it would be just basic pizzas and sandwiches but the wife and I each had pasta and was excellent.  Handmade pasta with broccoli rabe and fennel sausage reminded me of small family restaurants back East. Great service, prices very fair and perfect size portions. Definitely coming back.

Came for lunch today, great service and food was very good. Al pastor and Barbacoa tacos are excellent. Snapper taco is average. Guacamole is good but too sweet for my taste as the put mandarin oranges in it, not really to my palate. Margarita- just ok nothing special. Didn't taste like it was just fresh squeezed lime and a bit watered down. Overall a good experience and will be back.

First time here, arrived at 5:30 and only one other table has customers. The interior is very quaint and appealing and the patio really is nicely done but the good ends there. Sat down, waited for someone to come by (even though we basically the only ones here). Wife ordered the house margarita, terrible! Watered down no alcohol. She orders the empanadas but 10 minutes later the waitress says "no empanadas today, what else do u want"  Still waiting ...... Where is the food??  Food arrives- it's so hot it's obvious it was microwaved.  Come with....side of lettuce leaf and two tomatoes. Did I order a burger???? So we ordered a side of rice and again comes out boiling hot from microwave   My burrito was fair but my wife's green chile enchiladas were deplorable.   So for a burrito, enchilada, side rice (since it's all ala carte even though they call it "plate dinner" and water down marg $32 plus tip nearly $40  Poor waitress was very sweet and we felt bad since she probably makes no $ in tips as nobody goes here.  Oh.. And the dessert I saw at Fry's grocery store. Trying to pass that off as homemade? Seriously.   Overall,This place is just a disaster and will be out of business shortly. Don't waste your time / money as its apparent nobody else does either.  Rough review? Yes but deserved. Not a care in the world on quality and client satisfaction.

It's basically like AJ's jacked up prices with a Food City atmosphere. I will just continue to go to Frys signature and Sprouts. This place kinda a joke, thinks it's "organic" since it has a few more items than regular stores but not even 5% like Whole Foods. This place gonna be in trouble if they don't adjust pricing.

Best Mexican food in Phoenix area! It's a gem in the talking stick casino on the lower level. It's always quiet and never busy which I am guessing people don't know about it. It's true Mexican cuisine not Americanized with tons of cheese melted in the salamander and refried bean. This is authentic & doesn't make your body feel upset after you eat.  Live guitar player always there as well and prices are right!  Think Barrio Queen (overhyped) but much better and less $$$$. It's not Ajo Als or Macayo style, it's the real deal!

Wanted to try and compare to Fired Pie, this place doesn't come close.  Just had no flavor, red sauce very bland and topping choices are less and also just like Subway. At fired pie, they roast mushrooms, carmelize onions and more better "proteins".  These pizzas seem a little smaller as well.  Worth a try but won't go back.   Just a note: I saw a salad being made, it's small!!
