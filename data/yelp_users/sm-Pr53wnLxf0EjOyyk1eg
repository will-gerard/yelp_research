Went here for the XTRA910 NFL Draft party on 4/25.  Place is nice setup. Lots of beers on tap.  Service or at least the server we had was horrible.  After 5 minutes of waiting for the server to come up, I placed my order for a coors light... waited 15 minutes, then the server came back saying my beer must of been delivered to the wrong table, asked what I wanted and then I waited another 15 minutes before getting my first beer.  Happy hour price of $3.50 for a pint of Coors Light is not the best, but ok.  We decided we wanted a round of shots and we were promptly told that they can't do that.  What a great drinking establishment.  No shots if you have beers.  Well who the hell wants to wait 30 minutes between a beer and a shot, not me.  Very disappointed with the service.  I really hope our server was having a horrible day because she was awful.

This place is amazing.  If you are in the area you should absolutely stop by.  The carne asada tacos are fantastic.  The menu is small, the drink selection is minimal and they do it all right.  3 items on the menu: Tacos, Vampiros, Quesadillas!  Will absolutely be back to this place.

Found their ad on Craiglist when I was looking to get some work done on my jeep.  I called and was very quickly able to get an over the phone estimate on parts and labor for the work requested.  They also gave me different option for pricing on parts due to their expertise. I would highly recommend Raven Industries to all my friends or anyone that is looking to get some fabrication or drive train work done, even basic mechanic repairs.
