Thin crust here truly reminds me of thin Chicago pizza.  Friendly service too, and I love the RC cola on tap.  The afternoon slice is a big portion size.  Fries are delicious, and a generous portion for the price too.  Like this little shop.

Tasty tortilla chips and salsa were a welcome start to our meal.  Margaritas were tasty and good value on happy hour.  Enjoyed enchiladas.  Wish they had more vegetarian options.

Tomato sauce here was quite tasty, as I was referred to this place for the sauce alone :-).  Pizza was more of a medium crust in my book, not really thin, and certainly not Chicago thin crust.  Whatever they call it, it is a bit too thick for me if it is meant to be in the thin category.  And it seems a little undercooked for the thickness.  Nonetheless, very good overall, both in flavor and in value and service for this restaurant.  I like it.

Great coffee options here, brewed to order.  Nice staff.  Hipster vibe and customer base though, which is entertaining to me.  Parking is good on weekdays.  A few draft beers available, so this is a great night hangout also.

Incredibly poor service.  They "ran out" of their fried raviolis.  The insane wait times give the impression that the place must be out of this world good but really it's just the small restaurant size that can't accompany a normal restaurant volume of people.
