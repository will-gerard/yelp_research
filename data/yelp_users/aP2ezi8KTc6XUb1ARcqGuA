Great experience.  I reserved the car online.   They had the best price for sure.   It was quick when I went to pick it up and when I returned it.  I will rent from then in the future.

Horrible experience.   I purchased a pair of pants from them.   After I got them home I realized they had a security tag still attached.   I returned to the store and was told "sorry"  they  do not have the tool to remove it.   I could try and find a place that might remove it for me.  She thought there might  be a store at Chandler Fashion Mall that might be able to remove it.   She was not interested in helping at all.   Seemed to be my problem.   I will never shop there again.
