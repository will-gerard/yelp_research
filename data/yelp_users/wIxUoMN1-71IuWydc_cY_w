Went here the night before my friend's wedding because I was a bridesmaid and found out at rehearsal the other girls got manis and designs on their pedis. I had only got a basic pedi that morning. I only had about an hour before the dinner and found this place on Yelp closeby. Got in immediately. VERY nice staff - even gave me a bottled water. Got a gel coat mani (no tips) and it lasted many weeks. Shape I wanted and looked great! I just needed a design on my toes and she did them perfectly as described and they matched the other bridesmaids (just by my description - she didn't see the other girls). A true artist - beautiful work and still fast! Wish I lived nearby because I would like to go back more often! I heard while there they were going to repaint, etc so it may be an even better environment now. Would definitely go back!

Really great little place! Had the broccoli cheese soup with the hot turkey sandwich and had to eat every scrumptious bite! They have a quick grab and go section with pre-prepared items also if you need something quick. Friendly staff! Will be looking forward to my next visit!

Hit or miss here...was great in the beginning, but now I've been foiled twice and I will not be going back.  I love the atmosphere - nice decor, nice aquarium, but they have inexperienced people working there.  The first few times were ok, but now they are headed downhill.  My boyfriend's daughter had her nails done (full set) and they were lifting the very next day.  Not to mention the guy that did them was saying very inappropriate things to her.  Then we went back and they re-did it to make it right, but wow, what a time killer!  Because they made it right, we decided to try again just for pedicures, vowing to avoid the guy that hit on her if he was there.  The lady that did mine cut the toenails jagged with a cuticle clipper instead of nail clippers and didn't even file them.  They were left rough and VERY uneven.  I specifically asked to have the sides of my big toes clipped out (hangnails...ingrown...whatever you call them), and she barely touched it.  After she painted them and said she was done they looked AWFUL, luckily another guy came over and knew that it was done poorly.  He did his best to make it right, but again...what a timekiller.  The boyfriend's daughter asked for a design and the first try was nothing like what she asked for and looked gaudy, so they had to do it over - the end result was decent but nothing to write home about.  We were there for over 2 hours!  Then 2 days later both of our polish just came right off toe by toe.  What a waste!  Please get better, more experienced employees and quality products that won't wear off in a day!  Nice of you to try to make it right, but get it right the first time and stop wasting your time and your customers' time!

Found this place just exploring options around Arrowhead today. Loved it! Great food and drinks! Went for lunch during happy hour which is 1pm to 6pm! Also Monday is 2 for 1 moonshine drinks...yum!!! Had a bunch of appetizers on special...the queso dip with homemade potato chips was so good I kinda want to go back for dinner! :) Fresh salads, tasty wings - asked for the spicy sauce on the side so we could taste with or without - good stuff! Pot pie excellent too! Love the decor and music. We will be back!
