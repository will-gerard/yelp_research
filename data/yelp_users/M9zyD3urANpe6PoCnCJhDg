Tasty burgers and onion rings. Clean and friendly. I'd go back again.

Their green chile burritos are great! Enough for my husband and I to share too. Really love the chips and salsa! Better than many other places!

Not really a sushi place. More like a sports bar. They are the kings of spicy imitation crab. It's everywhere, on everything. Even just laying around the plate for "presentation". This is our last visit.

Bill came out to check on our garage door that hadn't been looked at for over 20 years.  He was the least expensive out of the three companies we called. We had a next-day appointment. He was on time. He was friendly and professional. He looked over the garage door and explained that the door was in good shape and it would not need any kind of service. WHAT???  This guy had integrity that seems to be long gone. Although we didn't need him to do any work, we recommend him for all of the above reasons.

Great every time! Absolutely our go-to joint when we want good pizza. Wings are great too! Don't let the location stop you.

My most favorite pasta next to my grandma's. My husband loves the suvlaki plate. My 5 year old will eat everything off both our plates! Go! Go! Go!

Been going to Blue Dragon and having Vinny Sky do my artwork for years now. Beautiful lines and great use of color!

I like this place! Didn't think I would, but I do. The Cesar salad was great...but I like a lot of anchovy flavor, so take that into consideration. I also liked the pasta sauce. My 6-year old had a simple pasta with a meatball and we shared it...we both liked it. It also had a Pei Wei kind of feel to the arrangement of the place. Menus on the side wall you order and pay at the register and then they bring you your food. Cheesecake afterwards was nothing special but still met my sweet tooth (but they didn't have coffee so that was a bummer) I would go back.

Great cleaners! They cleaned our church choir robes and we will head back when they need to be cleaned again. Titan's employees were friendly and did the job quickly. Very professional work. Will definitely use them again!

To sum up: Crust is fantastic. Pizza toppings were hardly there. Small pizza big price. Rotten lettuce in our antipasto. Waitress nice. Cannoli was great! Would we go back? Nope. Other places do it better.

This place has gone down hill. It used to be better but it now seems just like any old chain restaurant. From food quality to cleanliness, everything is suffering. Bummer!

This place stinks for 2 reasons. Food is too pricey & THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE COUNTER DON'T SHUT THEIR YAPPERS LONG ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY HEAR YOUR ORDER. Then you have to repeat it two more times which is annoying for me & everyone else behind me. Please stop the shiny happy people routine and let me have my coffee.

Eh...it was ok.   When we first arrived it was during lunch time and there were a bunch of "suits" eating lunch. That seemed like a good sign since we had more than $20 for lunch and these guys looked like they did too.   After looking over the menu, nothing seemed out-of-the-box. Seemed pretty standard fare. Mind you, they all looked tasty. We ordered the salmon flat bread (which was LOADED with creme fresh, making the dish glucky). Also, the sliders with sweet potato fries and chili dip (fries seemed generic and I swear they buy their chili sauce at Safeway). Lastly, the spinach salad (pretty good sized salad & tasted good too).   But, the ultimate part of the meal, which really ruined my desire for ever going back there, had to do with a glass of Stella Artois. The waitress asked which size we wanted - 16oz or 22oz. We asked for the 22oz size. She brought it out in a regular glass. Apparently, this type of beer comes in a very specific glass. I didn't know this, but my husband did. To my embarrassment, he asked for the correct glass for his beer. She explained that she had noticed the incorrect glass but didn't think they had the correct size of glass needed for the 22oz size. Since my husband and I were going to share the beer, we told her to bring out the correct glass and we would just pour the beer into the correct glass and leave the remaining in the current glass that I would then drink. She said that she would take care of it and took the beer back to the bar.   This time she returned with an actual Stella Artois glass of beer.  She explained that she "didn't think the beer would have fit, but it did! Yay!" (Her words) Because this seemed jenky, we double checked to make sure she had filled the glass with the 22oz that we had asked for. She said "absolutely, yes, yes". But, my husband and I weren't buying it. Awesomely, on the glass, it shows a measurement of where you are to fill the beer  - 40cl. We checked on Google to see what a conversion would be into ounces. Turns out 40cl is not 22oz, instead it is 16oz.   We called this to her attention and she said "oh yeah, i was gonna change the price to the 16oz size." What? Did you not hear our order? Did you not confirm 5 minutes earlier that it was a 22oz?  Super shady.   Often times I think our tattoos give off the impression that we are trashy and somehow have never been to a restaurant before or (in this case) can't do math. Which is kind of what I felt happened here.   So, with the waitress and the beer situation coupled with a lackluster array of food... I wont be headed back. Although the aloof homeless man who runs the restaurant did come out and asked how we were. Cherry on the cake for me!  Not one of our better lunches.
