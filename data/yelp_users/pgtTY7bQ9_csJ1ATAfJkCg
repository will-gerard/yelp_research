Don't bother making an appointment...I did, 24 hours in advance, and then upon my arrival, AFTER they took my out of town guest back for her massage, informed me they couldn't do my scheduled massage because the room was being used by someone else. Instead of getting a massage, I sat around in the waiting room for AN HOUR AND A HALF and waited for my friend...I didn't want to ruin her massage.  If they had let us know about the scheduling blunder before they took my friend back...it would have been a whole different story. I refused to pay for either massage and left my name and number for a manager. The whole experience was ruined.

Had a fabulous time with excellent food and live music on a Saturday night. My wild mushroom fettuccine with chicken was to die for and the creme Brule cheesecake was out of this world. No waiting on the day after Christmas. ..a major plus in our eyes...when though the place was hopping!

WoW...I am duly impressed! My 26 year old son took me here, ordered me a flight of beer to taste and recommended the appetizer called S W Poutine, which sounded gross by the description on the menu, but was AWESOME! He had SW Mac & Cheese with Macha, and I had the Silly Cheese Steak with fries...both to die for! Highly recommend this place for the craft beer and the food.

OMG...I HAVE to brag about Friendly Auto Center! I was having a problem with my transmission and was afraid to take my vehicke in for a repair. For one thing, I'm female, so the fear of being ripped off is high since i know nothing about car repair; and secondly, my vehicle is older than 5 years, past its warranty period, so I dreaded a big repair bill. I called on my way into work in the morning and Steve told me to bring it in right then! Since I can't live without a car, FAC hooked me up with an awesome rental for about 30% off the normal rate, and then called me a few hours later to inform me what the problem was AND that they had already called the dealership and found out it was covered by an extended warranty I didn't even realize I had! Badda bing Badda boom! They even gave me the dealership ' s phone number and a contact name! No charge. ..even though FAC added transmission fluid to get me to the dealer. The icing on the cake? The next day, when the repair was finished, I was even able to return my rental right there at the dealership when I went to pick up my car! Now THAT'S friendly AND trustworthy auto service...thanks Steve and Mike!

Discount Corporate Videos just completed the second video I've had done for my business; and just like the first one, it was top notch and exactly what I wanted! Working with Glen was super easy and he took care of everything so I didn't have to worry about a thing--including the delicate nature of how to handle the filming process with my customers. I was so nervous about being video-taped while teaching a class, but after just a few minutes I forgot he was even there. He was super helpful and accommodating about making changes to my first video, and probably to his amazement, I didn't even want to make any edits to the second one--he nailed it on the first draft! I'm using my video to advertise my business, so the sooner I could get it, the better--Glen had my project completed in less than a week! Professional & affordable--thanks Discount Corporate Videos!
