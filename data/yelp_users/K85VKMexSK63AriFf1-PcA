Good food... horrible service. Once we got our food they totally forgot we were here. Not sure we will be back even if the food is good.

Favorite place to go for seafood and the clam chowder is the best around. We also love the intimate feeling about this place, very relaxing after a stressful day of work.

Hands down the best dentist I've been to since I moved to Arizona 36 years ago. I've been seeing Dr. Goodman for many years now and would recommend him to anyone in need of a good and caring dentist. It took me a long time to find a dentist that understood my issues with being hard to numb and also took care of my actual needs instead of trying to say I needed a lot of work that I didn't really need.   Dr. Goodman and his staff are like family and they care for you as such. I cannot say enough great things about this dental center.

Great service from the minute we walked in the door. Food was pretty good and we'll be back if we happen to be in the area and want Asian food.

We came here because of the 5 star feedback and they were nearly walking distance from where we live. We were very excited to see a BBQ joint nearby but were highly disappointed with the food. Being from KC I know what good BBQ taste like and some of the best places are set up like this one but this wasn't even close when it came to good or even acceptable BBQ. They had a huge smoker in back but it wasn't used for the BBQ we had. Since we live very close we really wanted to like this place because the closest decent BBQ place is 20 miles away.   We bought a sample plate because we love BBQ and wanted to get a good idea of what their's was like. The food tasted old, like it was warmed up from days before and it had a lot of grease on it. The beans had a weird aftertaste to them and also had an old burnt taste. The smoker in back was for show only because the food tasted like it was done in an oven a week before.   Like I said very disappointed... don't waste your money.

Yum yum. We've ate here many times and have never been disappointed! Service is great as well and I hope they are here to stay.
