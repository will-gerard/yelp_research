Love this place.  Every time I'm up in the Phoenix area I try and stop in for one meal.  Fish is always fresh and flavorful.  Service is pretty good.  The owner seats you but doesn't do much after that, and he's pretty quiet; not rude but no super friendly.  Two young guys are the sushi chefs.  The rolls are pretty good, but what does it for me here is the sushi.  They also have a really good bbq beef tongue.    If you happen to go between 5-7pm, they have a happy hour.  Some drinks, sushi, rolls, and appetizers at a discount.  Not a bad deal.  I've happened to dine twice during happy hour and ordered about half my meal off the HH menu and half off the regular menu.  Some fishes I crave aren't on the HH menu.  The atmosphere is laid back, and I've always gone dressed casual.  Some people do get dressed up but it's not necessary.    Try this place, it's legit!

Had high hopes due to Yelp reviews and being backed by the Gordon Ramsay name.    First off it's just after 11pm and there's still a 30 minute wait.  Guess can't really blame the place if they are that popular.  After being seated and ordering right away; 2 burgers, 2 fries and a shake took about 30 mins.  Burgers and shakes even at a fancy burger place shouldn't take 30 minutes.     The burger was pretty good.  Nothing amazing but a solid good.  The truffle fries were WAY too salty.   The creme brûlée Oreo shake started out pretty good.  Once the top part (creme brûlée) was mixed into the Oreo part; it became unbearably sweet.    Maybe they were having an off night...???

I've been to this location twice.  This is the only Prada store in AZ.  The service here is great.  Super friendly and helpful.  I was offered a beverage like many upscale stores do.  It's nothing major, but just nice that they want to make you comfortable while in their store.  This last time I went in, I was looking for something specific.  Even though they did not have it at this location, they were able to find it for me and have it shipped to my home(the color I was looking for is not available online).

Horrible service.  Walked around the men's department for 30 minutes looking for a particular color/style pants.    Didn't see anyone in the department for a little while and just searched on my own.  About 10 minutes pass by I see an associate.  He doesn't acknowledge me or ask if I need help.  I continues to shop on my own.    By the end of the 30 minutes I see he's asked two other people if they needed help.  It took him a while to approach each one.  During the time he asked the other two, I walked passed the associate twice and he walked next to me once.  Never once even acknowledging my presence.    I guess I'll take my business elsewhere like Armani.  They are always very friendly there.
