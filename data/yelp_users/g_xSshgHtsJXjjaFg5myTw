Good parking for a downtown venue. I love walking in the sculpture garden of the art museum during intermission. They always put on very professional productions.

I visited this location for the first time last week. It's cramped because its "under construction". Go to the PV Mall location its much better.

Farrelli's is a family favorite. Birthday and anniversary dinners as well as the occasional Mother's Day brunch. I love the Art Deco environment. The bar is great for small networking events but can be quite difficult to navigate for large events.

This is a boutique program serving an elite group of families with young children.

I was quite disappointed today from a company I've been very happy about in the past.  A pity really because I've recommended them to so many friends in the past. Well all good things come to an end and as with many the devil is in the return policy. The customer service rep helping me was defensive boarding rude when I attempted to return three shirts I had purchased yesterday. Apparently I misread the return policy and thought I had 24 hours but that was just for electronics. Though I was calm during the conversation even sharing an idea to take to management that might mitigate such situations in the future she continually assumed my statements and an aggression on my part that was not there. I repeated made statements such as "I am not upset" "I've been on your side of the register"   We finally ended our interaction with her defensive recommendation that I consider reconsigning the shirts. Thinking perhaps this was a viable option I took the shirt that had been in my possession for less than 24 hours to the consignment area tags still on. There I spoke with another employee who seemed shocked when I shared that I shared that I had purchased the shirts less than 24 hours before and yet was unable to return them. She, like myself, was under the impression this was the policy. After learning that there were fees involved with reconsigning, and feeling the A Second Look had already taken my time and enough of my money I departed with the shirts still in had.  It is obvious that the staff need training and the policies clarified. I guess I'll try the consignment shop on Tatum and Bell in the future.

Ticket prices are higher than Harkins almost every time. Their IMAX theatre is a retrofit so it doesn't give you the same experience as those built for IMAX.

Its sophisticated and trendy. The kind of venue I'm always looking for to host film industry events.

Great bar and cool decor. It's basically in the lobby of the IPic Theatre. Great way to wait for your movie to start. Great vibe for industry professionals.

As an arts education consultant for the West Valley Arts Council I had the opportunity to bring Kevin Phipps with The Artist's Box out to Millennium High School last year for a Meisner workshop. He provided a very high quality experience for students and teachers that included insight into the world of professional acting AND strong foundational Meisner techniques. I highly recommend The Artist's Box and Kevin Phipps.
