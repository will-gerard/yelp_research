I can honestly say I've never had anything that taste worse. It was comparable to airplane food. I'm definitely not a fan of cooking my own food - but that's not why this is getting 1 star. I get that's part of the experience, just not one I enjoy. The steak was absolutely tasteless and the cheese was just bland. I really wish they'd put better ventilation in the restaurant as well because the smell of all the burning pots was enough to kill my appetite. Worst food I've ever had. Ever.

I've been inside their limo and their large bus. I was incredibly impressed with the cleanliness and service I received. The drivers all went above and beyond and treated us like this was their own business. The vehicles are pristine and in great shape. I've used limo service around the country and Transtyle is by far the best. You can tell they take great care in their company and employees because that integrity translates all the way through. I can't recommend them enough.

We've been shopping at this specific Godiva for years and today's encounter with Sara, an employee there was AWFUL. First, we stood there for about 10 minutes while she stood behind the counter filling out paperwork completely ignoring us. She didn't even take a second to say "I'll be right with you." Apparently, her IQ is too low to handle speaking to us and filling out paperwork simultaneously.  Then, we ordered several pieces and I handed her my frequent shopper card, where I get one piece of free chocolate per month on the program. (My bill was about $30, so I wasn't there just for the free chocolate). First, I ordered 2 dark chocolate strawberries and she said they only have one, pointing to the dish on the counter. I told her she had more strawberries in the window and she rolled her eyes at me and then got the chocolate. They ALWAYS have chocolate covered strawberries in their window display, so it's not like this was anything new.  Then, I asked if one of the pieces I ordered were free. She said "no." She didn't offer an explanation or anything. I asked if they had changed their program. She said "No." again - not elaborating. So I asked why I wasn't getting a free chocolate. She said, Well - you have to spend $10 a year in order to get the free chocolate, which you have but you don't get the free chocolate.  So I asked why I would be getting the free chocolate. she said "I don't know." Then, she sighed and rolled her eyes again and said "Fine, pick out a chocolate to get for free." So I asked if I could just get one of the ones I had already picked out free and she said "fine." When I handed her my card, I held my hand out so she could give my card back to me but she just stuck it on the counter on the other side of the register with the receipt and said "Have a nice day" and walked away.  I have NO idea what warranted that attitude but it was there before we got into the shop. As a business woman, she would've been fired ON THE SPOT for being so rude.   How can someone surrounded by such amazing chocolate be so bitter?

Disclaimer: I've worked here for years, so I'm obviously biased. So I'll give my perspective from behind the scenes. First, the chef/owner truly takes pride in his cooking and goes out of his way to get the best quality meat for his restaurant. I haven't worked here in quite some time but we still make it a point to go back several times a month. I can say that it's difficult to keep servers here because they really feel the ups and downs of the economy with where they're located, tucked away in the corner of Scottsdale. I have no doubt that if he moved into a larger restaurant in old town Scottsdale he'd be one of the most popular restaurants in the city consistently. As a middle eastern woman, I'm picky about my Persian food and his is the best. My recommendations are: Go there with a couple of friends so you can eat family style and really experience the food. Start with the Tah Dig (Go in the evening so it's available) with both toppings, then order the Pars Special with Zereshk Polo Rice. His cornish hen is to die for and his barberry rice (Zereshk) is absolutely the best I've ever had. End your meal with the homemade baklava and Persian tea or Greek coffee. Don't forget to try the Armenian wine for dinner (the bottle is well priced)  This meal is perfect for 4 people and you'll probably still have some to take home. Enjoy!

Dr. Wells changed my life. I've been seeing her for over a year and not only does she have great bedside manners but she actually takes the time to understand your needs and your health. The first time I met with her, she spent two hours going over my health and history with a fine tooth comb. I was having so many issues and every doctor I had been to wanted to take drastic measures.  A year later and I feel better than I ever have and didn't need surgery or long term meds like every other doctor thought. I couldn't recommend her enough and have sent several friends here who all feel the same way.

My husband brought me here for Valentine's Day and we will most definitely be back. It has a very urban vibe that I love. We started with the beef bruschetta and it was to die for. the combination of meat and cheese with the seasoning melted in my mouth and I've been craving it ever since. I also ordered the Artisan bread with the pesto and dollop of goat cheese. I loved it and the bread, I assumed, was fresh baked. It at least tasted like it.  I ordered the special which was the scallops with saffron risotto. It was ok - I wasn't the biggest fan, but I think it was more on my end then anything to do with the food itself. My 7 year old inhaled his pizza and keeps asking to go back. Definitely two thumbs way up. My only complaint is there were too many yummy options on the menu that I had a hard time deciding what to order.
