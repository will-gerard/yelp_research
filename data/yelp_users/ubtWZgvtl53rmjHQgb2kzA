The machines are worn out and old.  They really need to spend some money on new equipment. The free weight section Is fine though.

The food is good. The customer service is horrible. I asked 2 of the workers questions and they both ignored me.

I love their subs! They always make them really fast and the prices aren't too bad. I also like that they have cherry peppers. Most sub places don't have them.
