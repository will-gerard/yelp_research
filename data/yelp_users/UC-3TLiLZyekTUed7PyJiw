My daughter and I had the $10 lunch special, some salmon roe sushi, and a las Vegas roll. Great price, fast friendly service, and the sushi was good considering there is no ocean near by!

I came in today with my daughter, I had a gel manicure, and my daughter had a polish change. Everyone was super friendly and we did not have to wait long. My daughter's polish change was done first, I do not remember the technician's name, but she was very friendly and patient. My daughter  is only 5 years old, so she doesn't necessarily sit still for long. The polish cahnge was great, even with my daughter's tiny fingers, they were still painted neatly, and filed well. My gel manicure was awesome. I am super picky with my nails, and Stephanie did a great job. It has been a long time since I've had such nice work done. The gel was applied neatly, none of it got stuck to my skin. It is nice and smoothe like it's supposed to be, no ripples or bubbles. They are perfect... And my cuticles were clipped and pushed well, no bleeding or soreness! I will be back, I'm so happy I found this place.

Keep in mind folks, its not supposed to be authentic Mexican food. 5 stars for the all around good experience. We were seated promptly, service was fast and friendly (we made it for the last 15 minutes of happy hour!) Ordered pork nachos, Chambord margarita, duck relleno, and Mac and cheese. All the food was tasty, and the margarita was strong! Love the cornbread too. Have to warn you, the food is very HEAVY, delicious, but heavy. Reasonably priced, great service. I will return.

Great beer! If it was the beer by itself I were rating, bj's would get 5 stars.The blond and piranha pale ale are my favorites. Food is good, but service is hit or miss(never actually had terrible service, however only once had fantastic service). I go for the beer! And you should too!

Had lunch here for the first time today. My daughter and I shared the chef's special pizza. It was a thin crust with the perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings, just big enough for the 2 of us to share and be satisfied, but not be over stuffed. Everything tasted really fresh and well prepared.  Would've been 5 stars... but service seemed a bit impersonal. Still a solid 4 stars for me.

Disgusting. Ordered a double whopper which was inedible. I took about 4 bites cause I felt bad wasting it. But then I just had to throw it away cause I couldn't take it anymore. Don't bother visiting this location. Disgusting waste of money. Sad, cause I used to love the whopper.

Stumbled upon this place on my lunch break a few weeks ago. Awesome deli sandwiches! They pile on the meat and the flavor of everything is excellent. Service is quick and friendly. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. Will definitely continue to come here.

How awesome is this place!? I don't even like hot dogs, but I love getting them from Ted's! Have had foot longs, all beef, white hot.... Its all delicious. My daughter always gets the kids skinny dog with cheese sauce, and I love the onion rings!  I go out of my way to visit Ted's.

This used to be one of my favorite, hole in the wall Chinese take out places, then I kind of forgot about them. But they recently stuck a menu in my door so decided to try them out again. Still very tasty, and what a great deal! Lunch special is only $5.75!

So worth the drive out of my way! Dining at Elmer's was a life changing experience. At first, the place is not much to look at, though I find many of my favorite spots are that way. I came here after I tried them out at the booth they had at Oktoberfest, where my daughter had an epic bean and cheese burrito. On this visit we had a mini chimmi and taco plate, as well as an enchilada plate, both came with beans and rice. Everything was so delicious.... Totally hit the spot, now I know why this place has been there forever. We will be back, can't wait for my next visit!!!!

Some of the most amazing tacos I have ever had. Had the carne asada and lengua tacos. Amazing flavor and  texture. I'm sad I can't be closer to this place so I can have it more often, plus their prices are super reasonable.

Came in for dessert with my daughter today, after walking around we stumbled upon this place. We enjoyed a slice of the Dangerous Dilemma, and a chocolate covered cookie dough ball. Dangerous Dilemma was rich, delicious, and decadent. The cookie dough ball was surprisingly amazing as well! Their desserts are all made in house! I would love to give the rest of their food a try.

Always have been a fan of In n Out. This is my favorite location. Speedy, friendly service, consistently excellent food, and close to my work and home easily accessible from the road. They always get my order right, ordering for a family of picky eaters can be tricky sometimes LOL. A hamburger, double meat, animal style, protein style with fries well done is my favorite!

Cheap beer, decent food, nice change of pace from all the chains around in the area. $2.75 Heineken, plus their buffalo fries and Guinness mussels are my favorite.

Update 4/27/13 We visited Firebird's again this evening.  We had a wonderful dinner. My husband and I sat at a table in the bar area and were promptly greeted by our server. She was extremely helpful, polite and did not mind answering all our questions. We ordered some beer + a double shot of whiskey for my husband and champagne for myself for drinks with the lobster queso for the appetizer, which by the way was amazing. For dinner I had the sesame salmon and my husband had the 14oz NY strip. The salmon was some of the best salmon I have ever had, I was very pleased with my meal. Perfectly cooked with great flavor. My husband's steak was very flavorful, however, there was quite a bit of gristle which was inedible..... But the parts we ate were delicious. We were very happy with our visit this time, our server was excellent and the food was great. I'm glad that Firebird's were able to make things right and bring us back as guests.  Update 4/16/13 I was contacted by a representative from Firebird's, and was offered a gift card to make things right. Hopefully they come through and we have a much better experience on our next visit. Will update again after our next visit.  Original review 3/31/13 My husband and I came here for our anniversary. Food was good, I did not expect less for the price... So I'm glad the food was good. Service was lacking. Our server was slooooooowww, and nowhere to be found most of the time. She was so slow, our appetizer came out before our drinks. No sorry, not even any excuses. All the stars are for the food..... I used to love this place, but the poor service will keep me from returning.

Terrible service from this location. No one put in our appetizer order that we immediately gave to one of our 3 servers that was supposedly "taking care" of us. After waiting close to 20 minutes, our daughter's meal came out which we ordered with our dinners well after the appetizer. We ordered, onion strings and jalape√±os so we knew even with a backed up kitchen, there's no way it would take that long for our appetizer. At this point, we didn't want our dinners sitting under heat lamps for 15 more minutes while they try to make us an appetizer. We had our 3rd server who claimed to also be "talking care" of us check on the food situation, and he let us know that one of the servers must have forgotten to enter our appetizer since it wasn't in the system at all.  We made sure to cancel that order. Then the first server, the one who neglected to put our order in correctly in the first place, had the nerve to come tell us that she will make sure that the appetizer does not go on our bill. Like we were going to pay for food we never received. The rest of the food came out, just a couple burgers. It was decent, consistent chili's quality. At least the kitchen was doing their job correctly. Not once during our dinner were we checked on. We even had an EMPTY beer and margarita and we were not offered or asked if we wanted another round or asked how our food was. Plus the server looked so inconvenienced when we asked for the check. We are not picky or rude people, so I really do not understand the horrible service.... I am in the service industry and even waited tables in the past, and I would never even imagine giving a guest as horrible of an experience as we received at this particular Chili's. Save your money, do not go to this location. There are  plenty of other food options near the Chandler mall.  Advice for Chili's: 2-3 servers  for one table is excessive and unnecessary. Someone drops the ball at some point, which clearly happened on this occasion. The guest ends up with a terrible experience which they tell all their friends and Yelp about.... And your 3 servers get to share a NOT so generous tip.

Good food, very affordable. Fast friendly service. Excellent for lunch, and also have kids meals(perfect sized portions for my 6 year old!) I just wish they stayed open later most of the week. They close at 3 nearly every day, but Friday they close at 6.

Delicious vegan and vegetarian food. By no means am I either one, but I love vegetables. I had the spicy almond cheese stuffed peppers and the hummus appetizer. Both were amazing, also the pita bread they use is some of the best I have ever had. Plus I love how they get  their ingredients fresh from local sources.

I came here based on the yelp reviews. I don't eat pizza often, but do enjoy it on occasion. The pizza was delicious and the staff was friendly. They give you free garlic knots on your first visit too! We had slices of  the cheese and the white pizza. Both were cooked perfectly. Excellent flavor and texture. Even though it's a little out of the way for us, my daughter and I will definitely be back the next time we're craving pizza!

What a huge disappointment. No blond bock, OK, I can get over that.... But it got worse. Put in our daughter's food order first, along with some appetizers. Purposely, so it would come out FIRST. About 10 minutes later we put in an order for the sausage platter, assuming that would come out SECOND. After all, it had been 10+ minutes since out last order, right? No, the sausage platter came out IMMEDIATELY(lukewarm on top if that)! But where were the garlic fries, mussels, and kid's pizza? We were told the appetizer side of the kitchen is backed up.... What!?!! Does this place not have any control over their tickets? Or did the server forget to put the first order in? Eventually, the rest of our food comes out. Thankfully, my daughter enjoys the pizza. Unfortunately, the 7$ plate of their "famous" garlic fries, is a mere handful of frozen french fries with some garlic thrown in top. Mind you, I've ordered this appetizer before, the Regular Size as I did on this occasion, not the small size, and it was much larger than this(and tasted better). They did bring us more fries, but I don't know why the first plate they sent out even made it out of the kitchen.... It looked as though someone had been munching on it in the back before it came out, or they threw the scraps on to a plate and served it to us. Whether that was the case or not, presentation and plating matters! It avoids complaints, we eat with our eyes first, then or mouths. Mussels were OK(not great), but for 5$ I think those were adequately priced. What happened to this place? I used to enjoy coming here, I'm a fan of good beer, good food, and good service. All tonight's visit had was good beer, I could've gone to the store and picked myself up some and saved myself the frustration of a terrible dining experience. It's unfortunate that management never even bothered to come apologize for the issues that had occurred. They were aware, but no one came to the table to discuss the issues so they can hopefully be corrected in the future!

Great food, great beer. Food is made fresh! I had the lamb vindaloo pasty. Also ordered garlic jalapeno chips. My daughter had mashed potatoes, she loved those too! Wonderful, cozy feel in the place too. Love the candles in the liquor bottles.

Came here for lunch today with my mom. We were sat right away, and our server came to the table almost immediately. The food was tasty, and pretty big portions (even mom's plate which was off the lunch menu was huge).  Fast friendly service! In past visits, service wasn't always stellar (could've even considered it as bad).... But today we had a good experience. I'm happy we gave them another shot!

This place is amazing! Thank you Meagan B. For the review and recommendation. Well worth the drive from Gilbert to Tempe. Delicious flavors and fresh toppings. Staff is super friendly and helpful! They also have great specials like Tuesday double points and Thursday buy 1 get one free! This will definitely be on my list of places to visit with my daughter for a sweet treat!

I've had decent car washes from this place before.... But the wash I got today was not worth the money. I was in a rush and didn't have the time to thoroughly inspect the wash till i got home. There was still blue soap spots in some areas, the wheel wells were still dirty, and there were random unclean spots on the car. Disappointing. I will not be returning.

This review is for my most recent experience. I called ahead yesterday to make sure the new phone I wanted to pick up was available. I spoke to Brittany she said they had it in stock, and told me to ask for her when I arrive, so I headed down on my way. On my way down I called AT&T to make sure I was eligible for an upgrade, and I was:-). Upon arriving I asked for Brittany, she helped me immediately and had the phone ready right away. Everything was done and switched over within 15 minutes. I purchase a new phone about once a year, and this was the easiest and most pleasant phone buying experience I've had in a long time.

UPDATE 6/24/14 I had a check in offer I decided to use tonight for dinner. I called in my order to pick up, and once I arrived everyone was cheery and welcoming, and the very helpful young lady that was working the other night helped me out again. Even more awesome, she remembered my daughter and I! Had the chicken pita and garlic fries, and they were delicious! Had to add the 5th star! Great experience tonight   Original Review My daughter and I had dinner here a few days ago. It was our first visit, and we really enjoyed the food. We shared a gyro pita, Greek fries, and boneless bbq wings. We ate in, the food was made quickly....the only reason it's 4 stars and not 5, is when the kitchen staff rang the bell for the front of the house staff to pick up the food(there was a ton of food ready in the window btw), the one who was NOT busy did not immediately check to see what was ready to go bring it out.... Pretty much waited around a few minutes not doing anything. There were at least 3 other families in the dining room waiting for their food, plus I know they had some call in / to go orders also waiting. So, kudos to the kitchen, and the young lady who helped us out and took our order, perhaps the other employee was just having an off day. Or maybe she's the reason for the other reviews on here saying their to go/ delivery order took forever? Either way I'll be returning(for now), because the food is delicious!

Came here with my family for brunch on my birthday, we had a party of 13 and they were very accommodating ( they'll take reservations for parties of 8 or more with a 24 hour notice). The food was delicious, as were the peach Bellini's I had;-) We ordered off the brunch menu, and some bruschetta. Very pleasant, and positive experience!

Excellent service, very fresh sushi. I ordered salmon sashimi, salmon roe sushi, sea urchin sushi, and a Viva Las Vegas roll. I also thought it was really cool how they have a camera above the sushi chef's station so you can watch on one of the TV's the food being prepared. Great experience overall.

3-18-13 Visited this place for the first time today with my daughter. I found them on groupon. I ordered an iced Mexican mocha, never heard of that drink and decided to try it out. It was pretty good, different, but good. I also ordered my daughter a mini chocolate pie. She liked it a lot. Very cute place, I wish it was cozier inside though (very open, modern and artsy). Its kind of tucked away around the corner but still easy to find. Can't wait to try another drink next time, it is a nice change from Starbucks. Update 3-19-13 tried their version of the white chocolate mocha and it was awesome!

I really enjoy this place. I've come for dinner a couple times, I get sushi. It's been delicious every time. I am very happy with the quality of fish. Haven't had any issues with freshness, even the uni is delicious. Plus they have ranger ipa and santan devil's ale on tap. I had uni, salmon , and salmon roe on my last visit. Plus something callled a ryu roll. It was too awesome that I inhaled it before I could take a picture it was a fried roll topped with chucks of salmon, tuna, avocado, and other delicious stuff.

Excellent coffee and service! Everything I've tried here is excellent, from the iced coffee, to the blended drinks and lattes.

I came in yesterday for a pedicure. May did an awesome job, her nail art is beautiful and she was very thorough with the entire pedicure. Classic pedicure is only $25, well worth it with the quality of work you will receive. Plus the salon is brand new and super clean! Also, Jenny the owner is really sweet.

Came here for the first time today and I'm so happy I went out of my way to try this place. My sister, daughter and I shared a bunch of items on the menu and left very satisfied! We had the Combo Caribe for an appetizer, then shared the Chicken, Cheeseburger, Cheese, Boricua, Greek and Jalape√±o Popper Empanadas(Chicken and Cheeseburger came with rice and beans for the lunch special). We were stuffed at this point but decided to indulge in the Fig Cheese and Caramel, and Cheese with Guava dessert empanadas both topped with ice cream and chocolate.... Everything was amazing! Reasonably priced, service was fast and friendly even though they were busy for lunch. We will definitely be back.

This is right next door to my work. Great healthy alternative for a snack or a drink. My favorite is the buzz and the toxin flush.... Both I add extra ginger. The acai bowls and the pitaya bowl are also delicious, and very filling. Be forewarned, they are very busy, and since all these items are made to order.... You may have to wait a while. However, I've never had to wait more than 15mins even when its packed.

Such a great place for Boba and lunch. They have a huge selection of drinks available, and  toppings/add ins to choose from. They also have a food menu with small plates and snacks. Very affordable and great quality food and drinks! Quick tip: closed on Mondays, and will only accept card payment for  OVER 10$.

Came here for the first time today, never been... so I figured I'd give it a try. Ordered a breakfast power sandwich(ham, eggs, and cheese on multi grain), no cheese and a coffee. It came out with cheese, risking being uncomfortable for the next few hours from eating the dairy(lactose intolerant) I ate it anyways. Ate it cause I don't like sending food back, am fearful of what may happen to it after sending it back.  Sandwich was good but nothing special. Checked my receipt, cashier did not put on the ticket "no cheese", so definitely not the kitchen's fault. Nothing special or spectacular here, but an alternative to paradise bakery.

Great place for boba tea, smoothies, and juices. They're kind of tucked away, along the same strip as Tom's Bbq and Thai Dressing. I stumbled upon this place after filling my water containers at the water and ice in the same corner. They had an A frame on the street pointing where they were..... Since I'm a sucker for cafes of all sorts, I decided to try them out. I have been happy with everything I've gotten there. Usually will get the taro tea with boba, but have also tried a couple smoothies and juices. I heard they're gonna start making "snow" too, with different flavors and topping options. I'm excited to give that a try when they have it. To top it off I have received excellent service from this place every visit, from every employee. Absolutely 5 stars from me!

Only $20 for their standard pedicure! This includes all the necessities, plus a really good massage (even with some hot stones). My nail tech very meticulously worked on my nails, she was extremely thorough and professional. I was very happy with my service! BTW, my nails are difficult to paint because they are so small, and she still did an awesome job painting them. I rarely ever get pedicures because I am so picky with the quality, but today they did an awesome job! I'll be back.

I was so happy I tried this place out. My daughter and I decided to pop in for dinner on a Wednesday night, so I figured we wouldn't have to worry about crazy wait times. I saw on the menu that the Chicken is made to order, so I was prepared to wait:-) We sat at the bar area and the bartender was very friendly. He even gave my daughter some cherries to munch on. I had a kilt lifter and my daughter had a pineapple juice while we waited for our meal. We ordered a Big Kid's Mac and Cheese for my daughter(plus a chicken tender on the side), I had Chicken topped with gravy and onions with a waffle, and we shared a side of corn bread.  The food(the fried chicken to be exact) was Epic! I am beyond thrilled that I gave Lolo's a shot! I also loved the gravy my chicken was smothered in! I hope my next Lolo's experience is just as amazing! I can't wait, I'll be back!!!!

I am so happy I tried this place out. The food is absolutely amazing! We had a chicken and beef entree, both came with your choice of rice and beans. We also had the fried plantains and the stuffed potato ball. The food was full of flavor and very satisfying. Service was fast and friendly, and the food was well with the money! I highly recommend this place, I can't wait to come back and have more!

This might not be for everyone, but my daughter and I enjoyed it very much. It's a seated Zipline, so safe for all ages, just have to be a minimum of 42" tall. It goes up nice and high, so you get a great view of the mountains and the Goldfield Ghost Town. The ride is quick, just about a minute long, but for 12$ I feel it's well worth it, if you ride again the same day, its only 6$.  It's located on the Goldfield Ghost Town property, so lots of neat stuff to check out there too. We will definitely be back again!

I used to love this place, however, the last 2 visits have been a huge let down. When things go as they should, the drinks are delicious! My last 2 visits though have been a disappointment. Last week, they ran out of most of their ingredients they use to make the drinks. Some of which were the green tea, coffee, and the worst part, the BOBA! Out of the 3 of us in my party, only my daughter was able to get a drink, since they still had all the ingredients to make hers. A few days ago, I gave it another shot. I asked for extra boba in my Matchacha, which is an up charge (that I'm normally ok with) but it didn't seem like there were any extra added. This isn't the first time I felt like they didn't add my "extra boba" which I paid for, but this definitely verified that I wasn't just going crazy the last few times it happened. They've also made drinks incorrectly for us in the past, which they are very reluctant to remake, and in some instances the remade ones still don't come out right:-( I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately, I won't be back. There are other boba places in the valley that have more consistent quality.

I really enjoyed this place. Such a neat concept. Simple menu with pho, spaghetti, rice bowls and a few side/ appetizer items. On this visit my daughter and I ordered the meatballs spaghettina and the mozzarella sticks. The spaghetti sauce is of their own creation, infused with Asian flavors saut√©ed with pork, onion, and mushrooms..... unique, but delicious. Spaghetti noodles were prepared well with good texture, as were the meatballs. The mozzarella sticks tasted home made with bold flavor, I was very pleased. The owner/ chef was very personable and takes a lot pf pride on his work and business. Bowl To Go gets a big thumbs up and 5 stars from me, I'll definitely be back.
