So I went to Vegas with a very unadventuresome coworker....I can't count the number of times that she had a burger with cheese and lettuce...that's it.  So all the gastronomical experiences that were possible in vegas were wasted on her and I didn't get the chance to really flex my expense account muscles....  except here.  We ate here twice (yeah, she liked it that much)...and it was great both times.  In the Red and Blue sections you can order off either menu.  The first time I got the Red White and Blue Cobb Salad - with lobster.  It was delish - and they had a great pinot grigio that went well with it.  The second time I got a taco salad.  Also great.  The desserts - well in my case, the cakes....were A-MAZ-ING.  All for a very reasonable price.  The stacked sandwiches were huge and looked really good.  Of all the places I was dragged to (umm, margaritaville) this one has no complaints from me.

If you've seen the movie Something New - I'm kinda like the character Kenya...except I'm not an accountant and I'm dubious about the dating the gardener thing...but I do have a list of things that I don't "do": kids, animals, outdoors, extreme heat, fake nails...there's probably more that I'm forgetting.  Anyway, buffets used to be on that list.  Until I went here.  We got there for Sunday brunch at the perfect time - no wait.  And I couldn't believe that this was a "buffet".  Golden Coral it was not.  Lots and lots of options of pretty good if not delicious food.  Lots and lots of flavor options.  Maybe even too many.  I tried to have a little bit of as much as possible.  Which isn't really possible.  There's just too many options and they're all good.  The desserts - as previous reviews have stated - are very good...but actually not as good as expected.    Service was also wonderful.  I loved the heavy on the champagne mimosas and the prompt cleaning of plates and drink refills.    So - actually buffets in general are still on that list, but the one at the Wynn isn't.  So does anyone know any gardeners?

It was okay.  Kinda right there with PF Chang's - nothing great, but nothing horrible.  We had 2 appetizers and some noodles - the papaya salad and the tempura eggplant was nice.  The noodles were a bit greasy and I kept burping aftertaste all evening - but were ok.  It was all OK - but just OK

I had to go to vegas for a conference.  Of course I waited till the last minute to make my group's reservations - so this was the last place in my price range that could give us 2 rooms for those nights....without havign to stay at Bally's or the Flamingo.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The rooms are still alladin but everything else is remodeled.  We were able to check in at 10:30, but got a "smoking optinal room" that didnt smell like smoke.  The staff was very nice - from the bell staff that received my flowers to the business center.  I paid less than $200/night/room. I wanna say it was closer to 150 or 160.  And I got starwood points.  I'm very happy.

By default, food in a mall food court is supposed to be greasy and leave you counting down to a heart attack.    Opa is in a food court, but the food isn't like that.  I had the gyro wrap with a greek salad.  Both were delish.  Not greasy and full of flavor.  The gyro is perfect and the salad is romaine lettuce topped with lots of bell peppers, tomatoes, cukes, and olives. The guy making the plates up was friendly and confirmed what I wanted in my wrap.  It's a little more expensive than other places, but is well worth the $2-3 difference

Indiana University went to a bowl game for the first time in a crazy number of years.  And my big little cousin is one of their defensive ends.  So it was my pleasure to end 2007 watching the Hoosiers play the Cowboys of Oklahoma State University.  I can't think of any better way to finish off what's been a crazy year...though it was improved by being joined in the stands by Nadia C. (soon-to-be G.) and her adorable fiance Ben.    I don't understand football, so the game was kinda secondary for me, but being amongst all those screaming fans, and the cheerleaders and the band was great.  I'd forgotten that energy since leaving my sports loving home town.  But the game was pretty good. Would have been better if Kellen Lewis would have completed 60% or more of his passes.  Or if the Hoosiers had won (hey coach....DEFENSE!).  But football is pretty awesome from only 5 rows up.  Add some people watching (guy in red pants and wig), constructive advice to the IU dance team (buy new uniforms...something along the lines of the sparkly orange dresses of the OSU girls), and the awesome Marching Hundred (who knew that mainstream marching bands play riding dirty).  And we had a blast./  The only downer was not being able to visit with my cousin after the game.  For "security" reasons, they wouldnt let family and friends see the players at the stadium.  Since I wasn't staying at the hotel, and didn't know what hotel that was, I wasn't able to see him.  I was terribly disappointed to come all that way and not be able to give him a hug and give him a hard time about growing up to be a big burly football player.  In my head, he's still 12 and  gangly, and trying to grow into his feet and his ears.  But it's great to see that hes a "grown man", in college, playing football and playing for a team that's getting better every season.  So GO BIG RED!  And hopefully there will be another bowl visit to kick off 2009.

If you have a delayed flight or a connect in LAS this is the place to go. After realizing that i wouldn't be able to get my nails orderly before my interview tomorrow, I stopped in and had the xpress manicure. It's $5-10 more than I'd pay back home, but that's airport markup for you. And actually - it's worth it. The service is friendly - chatting when I wanted and also letting me take a little nap. The massage chair is one of the best I've sat in (seriously), and my nails look great. Highly recommend.

Kenny L. has been obsessed with Carne Asada fries since forever.   Seriously.  I've heard the glory of carne asada fries and the need to go to San Diego to get them for must of the 4 years we've dated.  For the uninitiated, carne asada fries are like cheese fries with carne asada on top. Or nachos made with fries. It's an easy enough concept, but we haven't see it any place lately.  So when we were in PHX for a wedding and stopped into Filiberto's for a snack, he was thrilled to see Carne Asada fries on the menu. And I was thrilled to have his multi-year craving satisfied for a while.  The fries were good - crispy, not soggy under the load of the toppings. The meat was flavorful, and with the salsas, it became delicious.  The space is nothing special. I think it's probably been 5 different restaurants, and the current owners didn't make any improvements. But the food is good.   And they had Kenny L's beloved carne asada fries.
