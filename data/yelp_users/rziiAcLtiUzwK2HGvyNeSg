This hotel is okay at best. If you are a frequent Marriott customer, you may be rewarded by an upgrade on your first stay but don't count on being upgraded after that.   After 10:30 pm their free wifi slows down and becomes almost unusable.   On the upside, it is very close to the airport and the 202.

The hotel is up to date and the staff is extremely friendly. The hotel is close to ASU, which means it's close to places to eat and things to do, as lomg as you are willing to drive.   The on site restaurant is pretty good, the downside is that they do not deliver to rooms. It is possible to call down and order dinner for pick up.

I have been to some pretty bad Best Buys, but this one is horrible! I was in the store at least 30 minutes and passed multiple employees, the only one to give me the time of day was the door greater and his efforts were half-assed at best! I have NO intention of shopping at this location again.

Great hotel, very clean. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are a nice size. I was upgraded to a suite, which is basically two rooms connected together.   The hotel is close to a lot of shopping and wonderful restaurants. There is a very large mall about a mike away that offers a regular mall experience along with some upscale shopping.

Easily some if the best BBQ I have ever had. Be sure to get there early, there is almost always a wait. I come here almost every time I am in the Phoenix area.

The staff is very friendly, the rooms are fairly large by most hotel standards.   If you are a member of Hilton's reward program you should receive vouchers for complimentary breakfasts (depending on how many people are staying in your room). The breakfast buffet is actually quit good  The workout room is available 24 hours a day, which comes in handy of your work schedule is less than normal.   While I normally stay at another hotel brand, I highly recommend Hilton brand hotels, this hotel in particular.

Scottsdale Pen is a fantastic store with a great selection. The owner, I can't remember his name, is extremely friendly and helpful.   I feel very fortunate to have found Scottsdale Pen while in AZ on business. I am a fan of Lamy fountain pens and there are no Lamy dealers in Utah (where I live). While I was in the shop I purchased a new fountain pen, an ink well, adaptor and refills. The prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend this shop to anyone looking for a good, reliable fountain pen or any other kind of pen. The trip will be well worth your time.

I was in Scottsdale on a business trip and I was looking for some light weight, compact shoes to take on trips, still bring my work tools and still work out. I went to the store try some Vibram shoes, not really intending to buy a pair. When I entered the store, I was immediately greeted by the staff. Ephraim (sp) and Jeremy answered all my questions, showed me multiple pairs and helped me get the right size.   After I tried on multiple styles and sizes, I found a great pair. I asked Jeremy a few more questions, he provided me with answers and his opinions as well I decided to buy a pair.   If you are a part-time runner, hard-core or just looking for minimalist shoes to take with you on business trips (like I was), you will not regret stopping by this fantastic store.

The hotel is newer and the rooms are pretty comfortable. The hotel offers free wifi, which is a bonus.   There are no places to eat within walking distance. There is a very large shopping mall surrounded by a large selection of restaurants.
