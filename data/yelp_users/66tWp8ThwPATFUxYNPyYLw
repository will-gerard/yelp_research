OMG, I'm sooooo sad.  I'm such an individual I need to look like everyone else....  Ok, so I got my emo/goth rant out of the way.  So this review is specifically of Club Tranzylvania If you are drunk enough that you just want to dance and you don't care how much money you blow, then Tranz is all right.  Seems like they might be hurting a little, as it was pretty much a ghost town all Friday night - didn't even need staff at the outside bar.   Their cover is too high, the drinks are too small and expensive, and the kids in there make me want to cry, but if you like the industrial type music, it's ok.  Actually, I only go there when dragged with friends, but, given the right amount of preparation in the forms of black eyeliner and cheaper drinks beforehand, I can have a decent time.

Mmmmmmmmmmm!  I came here with a group for a birthday celebration, and the weather was just perfect for patio seating.  We started off with some Thai beers, trying out a couple of recommendations, and a variety of starters.  That was the easy part, picking something to eat was a terribly hard decision, everything looked amazing.    Lucky for us, with 5 people, everyone picked something different.  I had the best Beef Panang EVAR!  The mix of curry and coconut was perfect....all the flavor, and the heat came, but after you tasted it on every inch of your tongue.  The jasmine rice was the perfect base for the sauce, and the beef was perfectly cooked.  I love curry and spice, but I want to taste the food too, and they gave me all of the heat and all of the flavor.  For my mom, who can't eat spicy stuff, they had enough options, and she was thrilled to get something that tasted great.  Most of the people we were with have been to Thailand, and they all agreed that this was very authentic.  They even brought out a nice traditional, homemade ice cream dessert for the birthday boy - which we all shared.  Everything I tried, I liked and I really need to go back and try more of their menu...I think I could go frequently and not get bored!  I just wish it could hit them up on my lunch.  They are also right off the light rail line, which makes it much easier for a Chandler girl to get to - no worries about traffic or parking.

My mom and I stopped in here on a whim on a Friday afternoon.  We really weren't looking for the afternoon tea experience, but wanted just a light snack.  We were charmed by the historic Victorian home, and thought the d√©cor was right in line with the era.  Now, if you don't like fussy, doily type settings (think Grandmas and old British ladies) you probably won't like this.  I felt like I should be wearing gloves - or a least be dressed like June Cleaver.    We settled on a small garden salad and a scone each.  We tried two different scones, and split them.  They were both really, really good, but we both preferred the Sun Dried Tomato one to the sweeter Cranberry.   The salads were prefect - lots of fresh veggies, good greens and a perfect vinaigrette served on the side.    Oddly enough, we didn't try any tea, but stuck with water.  The portions were delectate, but not too small, and they were priced right.    The server was friendly and attentive, without hovering, which is always a bonus to me.  We want to come back for an actual tea service - we didn't have time the day we went in but would love to plan a girls day out.  Apparently they also have Jazz in the evenings.

Are you a douche bag?  Do you have more money than sense?  Does it make you all warm and fuzzy to way overpay for a mediocre drink?  If so, Majerle's is the place for you!    Personally, I never cared for the "owner" when he was with the Suns, and this establishment has done nothing to change that opinion.  The food is bland at best, but for the prices it should have a little flavor.  I'm not sure what criteria the staff uses when deciding who to grace with their presence, but the female servers sure weren't responding to me (a woman) even when I held out a $20.00 - my 6'3" friend had much better luck, he was the one that had to order my drink.    I'm disappointed, this is such an easy place to hit on a light rail pub crawl or before or after a game or concert, but I just don't think I can bring myself to go back willingly.

You would think that a place that has been open, in this location as long as they have might have a few things figured out.  Hey Management, here's a few pointers for you:  When there are events downtown, people WILL show up.  Stop looking so shocked.  We are actually there because the wait everywhere else is too long, and we were forced to look to you by default.  Restaurant staffing is variable, meaning you are allowed to schedule adequate staff for an event night.  We rolled in, took a look around, checked out the menu and rolled out.  Then we found out the wait at Cooperstown, which was wall to wall with people, was an hour.  So we rolled back to Jacksons.  The wait for food, when the place was at only 1/3 of their capacity was an hour.  For food.  For bar food.  They have 8 items on the menu, most of which are fried.  Has it ever occurred to their staff to, umm, I unno, PREPARE?  We found an outside seat, and I meandered up to the outside bar.  15 minutes later, I finally got served.  I kept my mouth shut, because I watched one of the bartenders berate a woman for complaining about the wait.  Granted, she was a bitch, but a bitch with a  valid point.  They were only serving the people at the ends of the bar, completely ignoring the 30 or so SITTING in the middle.    $12 for 2 vodka Red Bulls, a fair price.  After learning about the wait, we decided to forgo food, but there was another 15 minute wait when I went back to the cash only outside bar.  So much for them remembering decent tippers.    The seating arrangement outside seems weird, awkward and unbalanced, and it only gets worse when you head inside.  I hear they have "servers" but since I only saw one looking harried inside, that could be more of an urban legend than fact.  They could easily add more tables inside and rearrange the outside to seat more people comfortably, but given that they can't handle a preconcert crowd, they shouldn't unless they hire some experienced, friendly staff.  I won't be going back anytime soon.

If chain restaurants offer us consistency in service and quality, well, I never need to darken the door of Hard Rock.  Good.  20 people walk in on a Friday night.  There is only 1 table in the WHOLE place - and the highlight of the group was the 100 year old dude wearing suspenders.    The bartender acted as if the vandal hordes had just descended on her.  Seriously, I think she thought she was done for the night.  She got pissy with our multiple orders, couldn't remember 2 drinks at a time, and generally was a pain in the ass.  None of the drinks stood out as anything fancy, so we started to pack up and leave.  While waiting for my friends to settle up, I stationed myself outside the door, and did some "in person Yelping"  - basically telling everyone thinking about walking in to run.    Well, I guess a drunk girl standing outside telling you not to enter is not a good deterrent for everyone.  Out of the 5 couples that came up (Conan O'Brian's show had just ended - go Team Coco!) 2 decided to try somewhere else on my words....smart people, they will go far in life.  The other 3 doubted my wisdom, and ventured inside.    All 3 walked out before the last of my friends did - every single one of them was stunned at how the single staff member working made them feel like they were intruding (I did exit polling) and decided that there must be another place in Downtown Phoenix on a Friday night that would like some money.

Another one of the places we hit up on a pub crawl night.  Like most downtown venues, it depends on what's going on down there to how busy they are, but I've never been disappointed.  Even when it's completely dead, the staff is friendly and nice.  The bar staff all seems knowledgeable, and was really willing to help us as we drank through the alphabet - I think it was their suggestion that for "H" we try a Harvey Wallbanger....  The only advice I have, is don't let your drunk friend wander off by himself.  If you walk into the kitchen when looking for the bathroom, they very nicely escort you out.

Other than the fact I can't get used to the new name, not much has changed at the Arena since the days I was a regular at every Rattlers home game.  The upper decks still cause heart stopping vertigo, the bathrooms have too long of lines and not enough toilet paper, and the concessions are the wrong temperature and way too expensive.  However, that all comes with the territory of any arena type event.  Most recently I saw the Billy Joel Elton John Face to Face concert here.  My tickets said "Obstructed View" but overall, we still had a decent view of the stage.  The large screen projections made up for the height we were at.  The sound was good and the concert itself was amazing.    The biggest problem I have is with the actual concession stand staff.  Is there a rule I am unaware of that forces these people to take 15 minutes to ring up a beer?  I understand the "I have to pour this into a cup" taking a minute, but it's like the longer the line gets, the slower these guys work.

A recurring theme of my childhood was "DON'T TOUCH THAT!"  "PUT THAT DOWN RIGHT NOW" and "SO HELP ME, I WILL RIP OFF YOUR LITTLE ARMS AND LEGS".  Ok, that last one might not be totally related, but clearly, I'm scarred.  For some reason as soon as you tell me not to touch something, I'm all "TOUCHY TOUCHY TOUCHY!"  and that does not work in most museums!  They get really pissy if you reach for the Mona Lisa.    So the Arizona Science Center is PERFECT for those who share my tactile proclivities.  YOU CAN TOUCH EVERYTHING! For those who are germ phobic, plenty of hand sanitizing stations to keep you clean.  We spent about 4 hours, you could go longer with older children, but if you have toddlers that might be your max.  You can leave and come back with the wristband, in spring or fall it would be perfect to go in the AM, have a picnic, and then come back for additional visits.  The Planetarium and the IMAX, as well special exhibits like the Star Trek the Exhibition.  We paid extra for the IMAX and Star Trek, but decided we didn't have time for the Planetarium.  That is on my must go back for list.   The Star Trek exhibit was good - but I'm a geek, so I wouldn't recommend it for a non-Trekkie.  I thought it was well worth it.  The IMAX was also great - my mom loved it since it was about Santorini, Greece, and she's been there.    But the highlight for me were the hands on exhibits.  All of them were great - and I actually learned some stuff!  I could go on and on about each of them, but I really think if you like cool stuff, touching things (THINGS, NOT PEOPLE) and have a sense of adventure and wonder, you would really enjoy a day here.  Note:  Until April 2010 you can get up to 4 free admissions with the Culture Pass, I think those are only good for the general admission, I doubt it includes the special parts, but still a great deal!

Wow, if you want to see an amazing variety of desert plants, enjoy a nice hike, and maybe even learn something, you can't go wrong.    This time of year, while it's getting a little warm, the plants are in bloom, and you really get to applicate the fact that Arizona has more colors than brown.  We spent about 4 1/2 hours walking around, which is enough time to see the entire garden, spend time where you want, and get the full experience.  I have no doubt had we stayed longer that we would have noticed even more things.  The Chihuly exhibit was amazing, well worth the need to reserve tickets.  If you haven't seen it, you should really check it out.  The photos I took don't do justice to seeing it live, and in such an incredible setting.  We did snack at the Patio Cafe, and while the menu sounded amazing, the sandwiches were all premade (nice that there was no wait) but a little lackluster.  It was fancy box lunch fair.  If DBG wasn't a non-profit, I would have been annoyed with the prices.  However, the birds really enjoyed the bread I parted with, so I think they would rate it pretty high.  Personally, I would just eat before I go next time, and not bother.  They had some great Earth Day displays in the Herb Garden, all kinds of information on sustainability and eco-friendly choices.  If you are looking to get low water usage plants in your yard, they had all the information.  I'm just not sure if that was a one time thing, or if they are there frequently.  Overall, we had a great time, and I will be using the Culture Pass to go again when the weather cools off.

I've been wanting to check this place out for years, and finally got to hit them up on a Saturday night.  Overall I was quite happy, decent beer selection, and the table arrangement worked well with our medium sized group.  The bar staff was busy, but friendly. Sadly, they were out of a couple of the beers I really wanted to try.  The patio area is nice, with plenty of room and tables.  The single toilet for the ladies was a bit of a drag.  Overall there was a great atmosphere.  Didn't try the food, but would go back to check that out.  Best part is that they are so close to the lightrail, because I'd never drive that far to have a drink or 3.

This Review Brought to you by the Letter "L"  Bobby C's has become somewhat of a tradition for us on Light Rail Pub Crawls.  We found them by accident the first time when my friend shoved me off the train and I almost got left behind....  The first time we went in, they seemed excited to have our business and we were almost sad to go.  The second time they had live music playing, and they wanted to charge a cover.  Since we were only there for one drink, we were about to pass, when they offered us the VIP room.  Basically, they stuck us in a dining room that's not connected to the main bar.  But they brought us our own bartender and hooked us up.   Based on the first 2 visits, my review should be higher, but then we went on Friday.  Ok, so a group of 20 already somewhat intoxicated people are somewhat daunting.  Plus - they waived cover if you had an active light rail pass.  Minus - they segregated us into the back room again.    What really gives them this ranking, is that we were drinking the alphabet and were on the letter "L" (bet you didn't see that one coming.)  So we ordered Lemondrops - see they start with the letter L - now it all becomes clear.  Ok, not sure what planet they got these "lemons" from - but my god they were terrible.  Ass drops was more like it.  I mean, horrible.  I can't even describe the taste.  We tried dumping sugar into them, no help.  Finally, we poured sprite into the drinks and by plugging our noses, were able to choke them down.  Well, I drank Brian's in addition to my own (I wasn't gonna waste the booze!)  We felt pressured to stay, but with no music, no entertainment at all and no decent drinks, we had to boogie back to the train.    Will Bobby C's stay on our rotation, possibly, as it's such a tradition now, I'm just glad we have stops before and after it!

Thank goodness I'm not ever planning on getting married again, because I will never set foot in this shop again.  I found my perfect, the most perfect wedding dress imaginable here, but after that it spiraled downward quickly.  The first visit was great. Not too much personal service, but I'd say it was about on par with David's Bridal. I tried on a hideous dress, an ok dress and then "The One". People stopped dead in their tracks to scream "Say Yes to the Dress!" at me. Women who were shopping with other brides started crying. It was truly amazing.  Now, if you want to check them out, go ahead. But if you are like me and find the perfect dress here, heed my advice...do NOT leave your dress behind.  Mine was never touched when I tried it on, pristine and flawless. So we bought it, paid in full, paid for additional dry cleaning and pressing and scheduled a date for alterations.  This is when we found our first difficulty. Communication was not the easiest as I am not fluent in Spanish.  We arrive for the first fitting, and both my mother and I notice the dress is now dirty.  There are smudges that were not there when I BOUGHT and PAID for the dress...photos from the first day verified this.  My theory is that they put my dress back out on the floor ad let others try it on.  However, not wanting to make a fuss (atypical behavior for me, avoiding the bridezilla appellation at all costs) neither of us said anything.  I figured they were going to clean it before I picked it up, so whatever.   Then comes the day just 3 weeks before the wedding, when I am supposed to get my dress.  I call the night before to confirm and am first told I will get a call back. An hour and a half later, I call again and get a different person who randomly transfers me to someone's voicemail.  A third call nets me a dude who says everything is good and my dress will be ready the next day.   Feeling confident because I confirmed the appointment, we arrive the next day. A staff member goes off to bring my dress...and disappears.  Seriously, she was gone for almost an hour and forty five minutes. Even the other staff was asking where she was.  No one is communicating with us what's going on, why the delay.  We could barely get their attention after an hour of waiting.   However, they did bring my dress, the bag we paid for, which had brown, muddy foot prints all over it. "Oh, yeah. It got stepped on" was the explanation I received. Wait a second, did you WALK on my wedding dress? Are you serious? REALLY?  At least they had it in the super expensive, way too small, plastic bag.  At long last, I am prepare to don the layers of tulle and complete my final fitting.  As the seamstress assists me into the dress I first notice a smell, and the as the dress goes on, even worse. It's WET!   Soaking wet, with dry cleaning (clearly not that dry) chemicals.  As the dress is being laced, we realize that a few of the boning prices on the  top are twisted a bit oddly and not laying flat.   As my mom was trying to fluff out  the tulle and fix the twisted boning, she read the tag - "DO NOT DRY CLEAN" - which could possibly explain why the dress was WET!  They staff then had the gall to blame me for their complete lack of professionalism. Apparently my calling to confirm the appointment "confused" them. Because, you know, confirmation calls are so out of the ordinary and, well, professional.    Now, I did not see all the horrors my poor dress went through, but I imagine getting lost in the store, rushed to the dry cleaners, yanked out wet, and walked on were probably enough. They even claimed that I never paid for dry cleaning, when my original invoice showed it.  The seamstress work was shoddy, communication about the bustle was almost impossible and the bustle had to be redone elsewhere. The staff was invisible at best, rude and insulting on the bad side, and clearly not at all concerned with service or quality after they got their money. I ended up getting alterations at Alterations by Kathy in Ahwatukee, and she was awesome, and in the long run the dress  was beautiful.    If you, or someone you know is thinking about wedding dress shopping, please be aware that you won't save any money here, but you will become good friends with new grey hairs, panic attacks, and if you are lucky, really nasty chemicals.

So I'm actually sitting here in Seattle Espresso, writing this review on my new laptop using their free Wi-Fi.  I'm not much of a coffee drinker.  I only use a french press at home, and only buy beans if I'm expecting someone to come over that might want coffee.  When I do drink it, I want something that's above the cut.    I came in an noticed the atmosphere first, lots of live plants, and some interesting artwork.  For a long, skinny store, they've made if feel spacious.  It's clean and moderately busy for a Sunday morning on a long holiday weekend. The music is nice, and at reasonable background volume, and with my iPod on, I can tune everyone out if I want.  The lighting here is also great for working on a laptop, not too bright, so I'm not glare blind, but bright enough I don't feel like I'm in a cave.  For those who have selected to read newspapers, there's nice lighting above each of the booths that provides plenty of reading light.  They were very friendly, and from some of the other people here, I can tell they remember, and care about their regulars.  I decided to try the White Russian Mocha, hot (they do offer it in iced as well.)  I'm a little hungry, but sadly their pastry case had nothing that made me want to buy.  The only thing that stood out in the random assortment of typical muffins and danish was the banana nut bread, but as I'm mildly allergic to bananas, I decided not to risk it.  As I sit here and sip the coffee, I'm very pleased.  It's great, full flavor, and a nice sweet mocha flavor without being cloying.  When I have a Frappuchino, I always feel as if I'm about to go into diabetic shock and it leaves a weird film in my mouth.  This has none of that.  In fact, this drink is something I would make for myself at home, if I wasn't so lazy.  So they get high marks on service and coffee, but they could do more with the pastries for a high rank.

At last, after years of bad, mean and rough dentists, an office that is amazing!  My parents have been going to Dr. Walker for about 12 years and have always been happy.  My insurance never worked with his office until recently.  I went in for tooth that had been badly mangled by several dentists, convinced he was going to have to pull it - which is one of my major phobias, I like my teeth in my mouth thank you very much.  Instead, he was able to put a crown on, and save my smile!  The staff is soothing, and always explain everything to you prior to starting.  They have a great DVD system, where you can pick a specific movie to watch.  I was able to get ignore the long (but painless) process of the crown buildup by watching "Finding Nemo" - and they had many other titles to choose from.  Also had them do my cleanings, no guilt trips about flossing, but a pretty smile when I walked out.

I met my cousin here for lunch, and we were really happy with the meal.  The place is a less than impressive on the interior, dingy booths, long and narrow.  It's terribly crowded up by the counter, not a lot of room to order and pick up your food.  I do question how a place can call itself "Los Taquitos" and then not have taquitos on the menu, but I went for the flautas instead.  They were good, but what set the meal apart were the beans.  The most flavorful beans I have ever had.  If you told me these were magical beans, I would have believed it, but I wouldn't have stopped eating them to plant one and see.  Service was quick and friendly and there was plenty of seating, even during the lunch rush.  Looked like a lot of people get orders to go.  I'd like to go back and try a few other items on their menu, if they come with beans of course.

I need Mr Chaos to leave Ahwatukee and come move in next to me - seriously, there's available property and everything.  We got takeout from here and it was sooo tasty.  Generous portions, so we were all able to sample a little of everything.  Their crab puffs were excellent, and perfectly crispy on the outside.  I can't wait for an excuse to go get another dinner from here!

Love this theater!  Probably my favorite in the Valley.  The location is great, none of my East Valley friends have a problem meeting here, since it's right off the 60.  The staff is always friendly, the theaters and restrooms are clean.  The sounds is awesome, and the stadium style seating means that I never have to worry about who is sitting in front of me.  With plenty of theaters, there's always a good selection, if there's nothing good playing, it's Hollywood's fault.  I love the shopping center it's in too, lots of great stores and restaurants near by.  Now if they could just invent a laser that zaps those annoying plot talkers - you know the ones who sit there and say stuff like "Oooohh, is he gonna open the door?  Oh, he opened the door! Why did he open the door?  What do you think he's going to do now that the door is open?  Do you think he'll go through the door?"

As a pool owner, I am constantly spending money and driving around instead of floating in the pool with a drink (umbrella in the drink optional).  If I have to go buy something for the pool, this is the place to go.    First, they are right around the corner from my house, so it's easy to pop in and pick up what I need.  Secondly, their prices are always lower than the other pool supply chains.    On top of the low prices and location, their staff is always top notch.  They look for ways to save you money, and are always willing to order a part or help you find what you need.  The only less than perfect expedience I had was when I drained my pool - I rented a pump from therm, and the hose kept splitting and tearing, and it was missing one of the clamps.  I called right away to make sure I wasn't charged for the damage, but when I returned it, I only got a half-hearted sorry.  No real apology for the equipment failure.  I didn't even want a refund of part of the money, although I would have taken it.  So that and the fact that their hours are from 10 am to 6:30 pm making it hard to go in on days I work late, are the only 2 things holding back the last star.  If you rent equipment, make them check it first and you should have an awesome experience!

Ran in to Ulta tonight to replenish some basic supplies, hair conditioner and the usual stuff.  As usual, they were short staffed.  But they actually called up more employees to the front and had three, that's right, count them, three cashiers.  Once I got to the front, they were super friendly and sweet.  I had to have my Ulta Club Card replaced, as I had lost my wallet a while back, and they took care of it right then and there.  No hassle, no problems.  I was in a good mood when I walked out, so I am upgrading them to a 4 star.

Worst shopping experience EVER!  I went in to get a new harness for my dog.  Not knowing what size he needed, we sit on the floor to try a couple on.  Employees taking inventory literally trampled us.  No pause for me to move, no excuse me, I had to make sure I wasn't wearing my invisibly cloak again. When I said something to them, they did not even acknowledge me.    Once I found the right harness and found some other things I needed, I went to the checkout where things got worse.  The clerk was surly at best, impossibly rude even.  I walked out of there feeling terrible, and my dog, who loves to go shopping when he's allowed, was so depressed that not one staff member even acknowledged his presence.  Have you ever had to deal with a depressed dog with self esteem issues?  It took several cookies and 3 rides in the car to make him feel better!  While I still think Petco over all has decent selection and prices, the people at this store are what got them a single star.  I will probably end up giving them a second chance in the future, and hopefully the experience will be different.

I love Lee Lees - I can spend hours wandering around the aisles just looking at all the interesting things they have.  Think of a type of food, you can find it here - from Chinese and Korean specialties to Halaal and Indian.  I love to cook international dishes, and this is the easiest and cheapest place to find what I need.  They also have great deals on spices and non-food products.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars from me is the smell.  The store has a very strong odor - partially due to the fish department, and partially due to the huge variety of items they have.  If you can get past that and have an adventurous palate, you will love Lee Lees.

I haven't been to Z'Tejas in years.  So when a date asked if I wanted to meet there, I thought what a great idea, now I'll totally have something to Yelp about!  We met at 6 pm on a Saturday night, and while clearly busy, it only took them 10 minutes to seat us.  The restaurant was nicely laid out, plenty of room between tables, and I didn't feel like I was crammed in a corner.  The noise level was perfect too, something that is missing from so many places.  Our server was friendly and quick, and answered menu questions with suggestions and good information. I ended up ordering the 5 Cheese Macaroni & Cheese, and my date got the El Diablo chicken.  Both were pasta dishes, but very different.  The mac & cheese was gooey and tasty, and very filling - no appetizer and I could not finish my plate.  I really wanted to - the bacon on the top was the perfect touch.  My date's chicken and pasta was spicy, but not overwhelming - subtle flavors playing out nicely together.   The portions were large enough that I couldn't even think about dessert, and was so glad we passed on an appetizer.  Overall it was a great meal, and I would have given them 5 stars, if it wasn't a chain restaurant.

Mrmhrmmehfhe.  Sorry, I started this review while still eating.  Ok, not really because nothing was going to tear me away from my meal.    I have never been let down by the food at Liberty Market, and when another place didn't work out, I dragged my friend here for her first visit.    They were packed, but that didn't stop the staff from being super friendly and taking the time to answer all of our questions.  After securing a seat, it was only a short time before our meals were delivered and the nom nom nom commenced.  I actually don't think we talked much during the meal at all, we were more interested in eating!  I had a juicy Tower Burger while my friend got the Grilled Chicken Pasta.  We were both impressed with the serving size, but it wasn't obscene like some places - filling and just enough that we were full but not uncomfortable.  I only wish I had room left for dessert.

I would love to tell you how the food was here.  I would be thrilled if I could write an 8 page diatribe that makes you drool because I describe the various tastes so well.  But I can't.  We hit this up on the recommendation of a friend on a Friday night.  Of course it's Friday in Gilbert, so we know it might be a little busy, but only one group was waiting when we got there.   We walk in and wait, and someone comes up to us and says "2? It will be a few, what's your name" and then walks off after putting our name on the list.  I grab 2 menus and we start to wait.  The food must be great here, because the place was packed!  We watched, stomachs growling as plate after loaded plate was set out for delivery to the dining masses.   After about 10 minutes, we decided to grab a seat outside, as we kept getting trampled by the staff (it's not a big place.)  We sit, and see that there are now quite a few people waiting, all but the one group having arrived well after we did.   And then the magic moment came, several groups had finished their meal and were on their way!  The group before us (about 5 or 6 people) were seated, and we continued to patiently wait.  At this point it had been 20 minutes, which in my mind exceeds the "a few" we were quoted upon arrival, but we were willing to be chill and wait it out.  Then....(insert dramatic mood music here) a server came out and called a name on the list.....it was not my name, and no one in the line responded to it.  She called it a few more times, and someone who just walked in 5 minutes before stood up and said did you call Becky (name changed to protect the stranger) - not even close.  The server said "No, but come on anyhow" and allowed this person to jump the line.  At that point we had enough hunger and thirst and went elsewhere.  I cut a LOT of slack to servers, especially when they are busy, but the attitude and the service we saw in the 20 plus minutes of simply waiting left us cold.  I'd be willing to go back and give them a try, but I might pack a snack first.

I'm rarely in Scottsdale, but I had meetings all day.  I asked a coworker where to go for lunch and he made the suggestion we hit up Big City Bagels.  I'm so glad we did.    I had a BLT Bagel to fulfill my bacon craving.  The bacon was crispy and there was plenty of it.  The sandwich was great, filling without being heavy.  The veggies were fresh and tasty.  The staff was friendly and I was quite impressed.  Now I'm looking for a reason to go back to Scottsdale for another lunch!

I love costumes! I mean I really love costumes.  Halloween is just ONE of the occasions I find to dress up. Don't forget about Mardi Gras, Talk Like a Pirate Day and of course the Renaissance Festival.  I also do makeup for a friend who does indy Zombie movies.  So shopping for Make Up and such is a fairly common event in my world.    Fun Services has almost always, for over 10 years, had what I need.  In addition to having a great stock of wigs, theatrical quality makeup, costumes and accessories, the staff is awesome.  If you aren't sure what you need, they will help you.  You can explain what effect you are going for, and they will totally geek out with you to help you plan.  It's like brainstorming and buying at the same time!

OMG Burrito the size of my arm! This is a great location, and the staff is amazing.  Everyone is always so friendly and nice.  I love the cilantro lime rice Chipoltle offers, and when I want something filling but not *terribly* bad for me, this is a great option.  I usually get my order to go, and they are always super nice about adding extra layers of foil to keep my burrito at optimum munching temperature.   All I can really say is YAY BURRITOS!

You can easily spend a whole day (we just did) at the World Wildlife Zoo.  I live in the East Valley, and it was almost an hour drive, so planning to spend less than a day would be pointless.  While the zoo does not have all of the fancy environments that others do, they have an interesting collection of animals.    Hands down, my favorite parts are the interactive ones.  The giraffe feeding station is the reason I love the Wildlife World Zoo.  After climbing the platform, getting to pet and feed giraffes is amazing.  This also makes for incredible photo opportunities, as the almost 800 photos I took will attest to; some of the best were of the giraffes.    Next to the giraffes, the Lorry Parrot feeding was amazing - I could have done that more than once that day.  Walking into the aviary, having the parrots land on you, eat apples right out of your hands - it's so amazing.  Lots of laughs when two parrots decide they like the same apple.  This is another great place for those who like to take pictures.  No fences or cages between you and the birds - and the brightly colored feathers come out great!  The new aquarium is also very cool - this was the first time I ever got to pet stingrays.  The only thing I was not as thrilled with was the penguin exhibit.  The glass was dirty and harder to see through than I would have liked.  Of course, I do have an irrational love of penguins (it might be a Linux thing) and so unless I can actually pet the penguins, I'm never satisfied.  In response to the more negative reviews:  Um, you are in Phoenix, I never recommend doing anything outside if it's more than 105 degrees - that's supposed to be a given when you live in a desert.  And while they do charge extra for some of the little features like the train ride - so does the Phoenix Zoo - and the World Wildlife Zoo's additional charges are minuscule.  Keep in mind this is not just a look pretty zoo, they actually have an amazingly successful breeding program, and the primary focus is saving species.  If you don't want to experience the real smells and sounds of wild animals, stay home and watch the Discovery Channel.

For Mother's Day weekend, my parents got a room here - a nice little "stay-cation".  While I didn't have a room, I did spend the whole day here with the family.  The staff here seems to be excellent, friendly and professional.  The pool area is awesome, lots of space, and plenty of lounge chairs to relax on.  Afternoon is shy on shade, a common problem in Arizona, but reason enough to abandon the pool for the inside.  The lobby is fantastic, huge windows with amazing views, a waterfall and a coffee shop and bar in caves.  The rooms are nicely appointed, and comfortable, with patios or balconies.  The whole Sheraton is non smoking, so all the rooms smell nice.  The bathroom had both a large tub and a huge walk in shower.  Sound didn't seem to carry into the rooms from the neighbors or the hallway.  And like all Sheratons, you have got to try the mandarin lotion!    They have a river that not only helps keep the are cooler in the summer, and boats that will take you to the golf course or Rawhide - little water taxis and great guides.   They have done a great job bringing the Gila River Indian Community history and tradition into a modern hotel, without being hokey. I'll be recommending the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort to anyone looking for a place to stay here in the Valley!

What can I say, I love an Iris Pub.  Seamus does a good job of providing good drinks at a decent price. Seating is a little limited for really large groups - we had to take over more than one table, but the staff didn't bat an eye when 20 or so people stumbled in.  Live music was good, just made it a little loud.  I love to eat there, but instead tried on a liquid diet.  I had some of the various beers they offer, but my friends tried the "Prairie Fire" which was strong enough to make my eyes water from 10 paces.  I actually think they have to have a fire extinguisher handy in case you spontaneously combust while drinking it.  All in all Seamus is always a solid choice when downtown, for lunch, dinner or an evening out.

While rockin' the 2011 Comicon experience, you can work up quite a hunger.  We decided to get out of the convention center for a bit, and ended up wandering over to Seamus McCaffrey's for a beer with out lunch.  I had a grilled cheese with bacon and tomato, which was the perfect compromise between the grilled cheese and BLT that I was craving.  Kevin had the beef stew, served with fresh soda bread.  Both meals were tasty and filling, and paired with a Kilt Lifter, the perfect lunch.    The music was at the right level for the crowd, the service was fast and friendly, and there were a few TV's showing Football (Soccer) but not too many to be distracting or annoying.

I've been here for several events, most recently Madame Butterfly, but also some plays and saw Regina Spektor.  Every time I go, I get a little thrill of excitement, knowing that I'll be in such a historic and regal enviornment.  I've never had a bad seat, and even waiting for the show to begin, you can enjoy just looking at the amazing details in this building.  If you can, they do a lunchtime tour of the theater, I highly recommend it.    You learn a whole new level of appreciation for the building, and you can impress your friends next time you go there for a show.

Ok, yeah it's Wal-Mart.  I know I know, the epitome of all corporate evil and all that crap.  But let's face it, sometimes a girl needs a new door knob, a $10.00 vinyl purse, some new panties, and a garden hose at 2:00 am.  Where else can you go?  However, this Wal-Mart has seen better days.  It's like the old lady at the end of the bar, well past cougar status, but still tarted up and trying, and just ending up scarier than anything.  They are currently undergoing a MASSIVE renovation - not sure what all they plan, but the store is a mess right now - impossible to find anything, nothing makes sense.  Once this is done, and the remodeled store is in order, I will review again, and hopefully raise my rating.  For now, I would rather drive farther and not spend 30 minutes wandering around and wishing I had a Sherpa.

Ok, so it's a Jack in the Box - I'm not exactly expecting Alton Brown to be flipping burgers.  However, this specific Jack in the Box seems to constantly be running in slow motion.  Since they are open 24/7, it's a great late night drive through spot, and most of my experience is with the drive through.  I don't think that I have ever waited for less than 10-15 minutes from ordering to getting my food.  Even if there are cars in front of me in line, I still end up sitting at the window for at least 5 minutes.  It's like the staff there runs in slow motion.  Of course, when you do get it, the food is hot, which is one of the reasons I keep going back.  I would rather wait for hot food than have it cold and soggy.  Even going inside is like entering a time warp.  The last time I went inside, I waited for 15 minutes before my order was taken.  There was one other customer inside the restaurant.  I then waited for another 10 for my value meal.  At once point a server did offer me a free shake for the wait, but by that time I was almost done eating, and really didn't have another 15 minutes to spare for them to make the shake.  As far as Jack in the Box's go, this one is pretty sad, but they are saved by being about the only 24/7 drive through in this area.

I've been shopping at this Safeway since I moved into my house over 7 years ago.  I have consistently been pleased with the service I get there.  The staff is always friendly, you get greeted as you shop the aisles, and they are quick to add more checkout staff when there is a line.  The produce, meat, bakery and deli selections are always good.  Safeway sometimes has higher prices than the other Grocery stores, but for the location and service, it's my store of choice.    Always clean and neat, and usually very well stocked I almost enjoy grocery shopping when I go.

We came here for my birthday - a friend planned it all out.  I was extremely disappointed.  We never tried any food, but the service - well, that's what I guess I have to call it was non-existent.  The drink prices were high for the quality and the size.  The staff was unfriendly to downright rude.  Granted, about 20 or so people came out for my birthday, but it was a calm group, and the staff should have been easily able to cover us.  People in my group were even clearly overcharged, and staff was not accommodating or gracious, even when they admitted it was their mistake.   The inside was seedy, but not in a fun, dive bar way.  The layout was awkward, and their excuse for a patio WAY too small for the size of the bar.  Their name is accurate, the Dirty Drummer was just that - dirty - and I won't be back.

The best thing this bar has going for it is that it's stumbling distance from my house.  I've never seen it packed, and it's usually a somewhat depressing, lackluster "regular" crowd.   Nothing sets it out from any of the other bars, to the positive or the negative.  It could be any lame bar in any lame city.    The time I was there for karaoke, I do have to say the karaoke host was quite good natured, as my 2 incredibly drunk friends and I quickly learned, no, we in fact do NOT know all the words to "Gold Digger".  He was quite encouraging, as we more or less mumbled incoherently through the song, flung the mics at him, and ran back to hide our shame in our beers.  (Hmmm, Chris T, were you there that night?)  I actually keep forgetting it's there, it's sort of hidden in the parking lot of a non-exciting shopping center.    However, if you do go in, give Jamie, the bartender props - she's fun, and probably part of the reason that regulars keep going back.  Overall, I'll probably go again in the future, but I would love to see them do something to liven the place up.

NEVER AGAIN!  Getting ready for a road trip to California, I decided to skip going to my regular mechanic and hit up Jiffy Lube - I even had a coupon.  I am normally pretty tough when it comes to all the add-ons they try to sell you; I'll replace my own air filter thank you very much.  However this time they got me on the radiator flush.  I figured it was summer, we were driving through desert - better than having the car overheat, right?  WRONG!  A bunch of monkeys with tools and hopped up on crack couldn't have been worse for my car.  As I was leaving for work the next morning, the car immediately overheated, something it had NEVER done.   I went right back to Jiffy Lube, who gave me some line about it not being topped off.  They never actually checked anything - they just patted my pretty little head and sent my on my way.  I guess it's my fault, for being an uppity female who wants to drive....any way, a block away the car temp started climbing again.  So I went to a DIFFERENT Jiffy Lube hoping it was just the staff at the one by me.  They also said that it wasn't their fault, blah blah.  Again, I was treated like a moron because I am a girl.  Finally one of the staff members working there, risking their own job, gave me the number of the regional franchise owner.  But my car was still overheating.  I gave up, called my regular mechanic who sent a tow truck out.   Jiffy Lube cracked my radiator with their "flush" service.  So $300 later, I had a new radiator and a burning desire for revenge on Jiffy Lube.  I suggest the only way you go to ANY Jiffy Lube is if you are taking your arch enemy's car, or extremely masochistic.

What's not to love about Uncle Bears?  First, the atmosphere:  Bar with peanut shells on the floor, plenty of bar, booth or table seating, and a decent sized patio.  TVs cover your sporting or random television needs - we watched the '08 election returns there.  Then the dog pictures - I keep meaning to add my dog to the collection.  If you bring in framed photo (get the size first, I can't remember) of your dog, they will hang it.  You can even bring your pup to the patio, and the staff will bring them water.  Food and drinks:  Everything I have had here has been great.  The only thing that has ever been less than perfect was some beer tasted a little off right after they changed the keg.  We mentioned it to our server, and our drinks were replaced right away.  The food is fantastic, from the burgers to the chicken strips, and don't forget about the cheese fries!    I love this specific Uncle Bears because they are about 4 blocks from my house, which means I can easily walk home if I'm a little tipsy.  They also do karaoke, and this one has a decent turnout of good singers.  All and all, this is a great neighborhood bar.

While I don't generally order out for pizza, when I do, I'm usually very satisfied with Papa John's.  Their online ordering is great, and always winds up with a correct order.  They deliver within 30-40 minutes, and since they are close to my house, the pizza is always hot.

I have to break this review down into 3 sections to do it right: Farmer's Market, the Wild West Town and the Steakhouse.  We started out with the Farmer's Market - a great collection of vendors, some amazing fresh veggies (mmmm, green tomatoes!) and fry bread!  The best deal in town for a huge breakfast! Steak, home fries, eggs and Texas toast for only $5.00!  You can't beat that with a stick, but a fork will do just fine.  That breakfast stayed with us all day.  The only thing they really need is more shade - we ended up eating inside the bar, because there is NO shade at the outdoor seating area.  Fine at night, but this time of year, a little too uncomfortable.  We were so impressed, we decided to come back for dinner when the "town" opened up. I'm not sure if it's because it's off season, but the town itself was not that impressive.  Yes, the buildings are cool, and they did a great job setting everything up.  It was just....well...boring.  The moved all the action into the "stage" area, and there were very few people in costume walking the streets and interacting with the guests.  It felt more like a ghost town then a wild west town.    Of course, this wasn't the reason we came back, which leads me to the third and final part of my review, the steak house.  We were seated right away, and a pretty decent C&W live band was playing, with lots of classics by Roger Miller, Johnny Cash and other classics.  The servers were friendly and helpful, and we took our time deciding what to eat.  We all decided to try the Rawhide Amber - a nice, well balanced beer.  We also started with the fried onion strings and fried green tomatoes (couldn't wait to cook ours up.)  The onion strings were great, and as a starter, the basket was plenty for 5 people to share.  The fried green tomatoes were good, the feta on top really tasted great, but the breading wasn't the best I've ever had.  They also brought out little cornbread muffins, the best I've had that my mom didn't make, and a jar of delicious bread and butter pickles.  Honestly, I probably could have walked away satisfied after just the starters!  Side note:  We didn't bother with the rattlesnake, as we are all natives, and have had it before!  On to the main course, the three ladies ordered the Fillet Mignon, and the guys ordered one of the Sonoran Chicken specials and the Yellow Bellied Cowboy.  Sadly, I can't tell you how the Sonoran chicken was, as about 5 minutes before they served us, the waitress came to tell us that they were out.  We were left to wonder how long it takes to figure out you are out of something.  It turned out just fine, as they took the whole order off the check, but still brought my grandfather his side items, and we all shared with him.   It's not like we were running low on food...  The fillet was one of the best I've ever had, juicy and flavorful, cooked to perfection.  On a lovey bed of mashed potatoes that became infused with the juices of the fillet.  My mouth kept saying eat! Eat! but my stomach screamed for mercy, so I had to request a box.  We couldn't even think of dessert, but it sounded amazing from the descriptions on the menu!  I'd go back for an awesome steak meal anytime, and plan on hitting up the market frequently, but I wouldn't build the town up to out of town guests.  It's fun, as long as you aren't expecting too much, save that for Old Tucson.

Did you say inexpensive massage? I'm so there.  I've been coming here for years when the tension works its way though my neck and back.  First, I love the exclamation of "HOLY CRAP!" I hear as they first feel the knots that rival a sailors best work.  Even more so, I have often felt that the students, who are about to graduate, pay more attention to how you feel and what is working than someone who's maybe a little jaded.  I've tried their massage and spa services, and never walked away unhappy.  The clean, peaceful and professional environment strips away my worries as soon as I walk in.  The location, for East Valley people is great, and booking an appointment is  easy.  In fact, I think I'm going to go book one now.  All of their services are on their web site, so its easy to decide what you want by reading the menu.  If you aren't sure what you need or what would be best, they will discuss what you need with you.

I hadn't been to the Marquee in years, I really can't remember.  A friend told me Vampire Weekend was playing there, and I just had to have tickets.   I was thrilled with the venue.  I didn't care for the opening act (Abe Vigoda, a band, not the old dude) but that gave me plenty of time to hit up the bar, check out the huge patio/yard area and visit the ladies.    All the lines moved fast considering how packed it was, and the staff was all super friendly and nice.  For the show itself, it's a small enough venue that I can't imagine there are too many bad places to hang out, and I was close enough to the stage, but had enough room around me to keep from feeling claustrophobic.   Vampire Weekend lived up to all of my expectations and then exceeded them and all in all the night was a huge success.

When thinking of Irish pubs, I know we all have the same image in our head....a bunch of popped collar, frat boy douchebags trying to out cool each other and find the stupidest, skinniest girl in the room right?   No, really, you see misty green hills, friendly barkeeps, and a nice, welcoming crowd?  Apparently the people running Rula Bula have either never been to Ireland, or come from County Jerkface....because this pub is about as Irish as Ceaser Chavez.  Where is the friendly atmosphere?  Actually where is ANY atmosphere?  Where is the friendly service?  Where is the tasty Irish fare?    Actually, Rula Bula is great - every once in a while, I just simply feel TOO good about myself.  I get too confident and comfortable, and I really need to be bitch-slapped back to reality.  When this happens, a quick trip to Mill and a visit to this pub can make anyone feel terrible.  Such a waste of awesome real estate, and yeah, the little signs and kitchy stuff they have is cute.  But Irish pub, you are kidding me.  Rula Bula you can P√≥g mo th√≥in!

Overpriced, overrated, and disgusting.  If you really want a good look at Sushi Eye, spend a while on the SOUTH side - they have a back door that faces Elliot.  First, this door is confusing, as you enter the Quzinos there, and a great time can be had watching all the visitors open the back door to face the kitchen.  However, they will simply be ushered through the kitchen, instead of being asked to walk around.  To avoid slander, I won't mention what else I've seen, but I have called the Health Department.  Personally I would rather eat of of the bait bin at a fishing supply store than to eat this sushi.

Rosies makes me want to live downtown.  What a great place! It's cosy, comfortable and a great time.    The food is pretty authentic, and they have a nice, robust menu.  The beer selections are good, and the service has always been fast and friendly.    It might get a bit noisy at peak times, but it just seems to fit the atmosphere.  I would be a regular here if I was not always in the East Valley.

I've been here twice for dinner now, and both times have been great.    Started with the "salad" bar - except it has much more than the usual offerings of iceberg lettuce.  How about plump shrimp cocktail, fillet medallions, tasty traditional salad, pasta salad and more.  The salad bar would be enough to keep me happy all night.  Yet, you have to fight that impulse to eat your body weight in shrimp, as the best is yet to come.  Once you are ready, the staff starts inundating your table with various selections of meats....on swords.  First, that's just cool to have swords as skewers.  The variety and flavor of the meats is incredible.  The beef was fantastic, the lamb made me want to cry, so tender and flavorful.  Even the pork, and I hardly ever eat pork was delectable.  I love that you can repeat your favorites, and pass on what you don't want.    Amidst the parade of meats, there are other little offerings on the table, such as fried bananas...Can I just get an order of those please?  Tiny little rolls that taste great and are perfect for sopping up the juices.  Drinks - great selection of beers, mixed drinks and liquors.  I can't remember the names of everything we tried, first because we tried all Brazilian fare recommended by our waiter.  Secondly, the amount of  these items I tried has reduced my name retention capabilities.  Dessert.....yeah, like I could fit that in after the salad bar, the meats, 47 pieces of fried banana and the drinks.  You know I managed it.  Everything was great, but nothing stood out as a must try again.  Next time, for the safety of my body, I could skip dessert and not feel shorted.  The only reason this isn't a 5 star for me is that it's pretty expensive, and that makes it good for special occasions only.  Also, great for events where I'm not the one paying...I'm free next weekend.....

I love to read.  I mean I really love to read, about a book a day on average.  With that in mind, books are not cheap, and I love "recycling" them to save money and paper.    Changing Hands offers a wide variety of books, both new and used.  While I will always miss the Mill Ave. store of my youth, this Tempe location does a great job.  They have a great area for readings, easy to hear and see the author, while allowing others to browse the rest of the store.  One thing I really like is that when you trade in book, if there are one's that they can not buy from you, they will donate them.  Often I'll just pass them along that way, it saves me a trip anywhere else.    Just walking into any bookstore for me is a joy - the smell of all those books is like ambrosia to me.  Unlike the corporate chains, the Changing Hands staff is always super friendly and nice, and always helpful.  It's like walking into a friends house - you immediately feel welcome.

I started going to their original location in Tempe, and let me tell you - they lost nothing by expanding.  If you like Middle Eastern food, this is a great place to try out - with more of a fast food then full on dining experience.  Get the Greek Fries - awesome fries covered in Feta and Taziki sauce!  One order is plenty to share with at least 2 people, I have yet to finish an order when I get other food.  The pitas and gyros are great, the lamb is always seasoned perfectly.  One of my favorite places to go for an amazing meal that doesn't take an hour!

A whole day spent thrift shopping, and things were starting to look daunting.  You can only go to so many places before the smell of poor and sad seeps into your skin (this is fixed by visiting a bar post shopping trip.)  Then we found Flo's - lots of neat  stuff everywhere.  All seemed to be good quality and in good shape.  While they didn't have what I was looking for, they are on my list of gotta go back and keep checking.

After working 12 hour days all week, I really needed a break, so I jumped at the chance to hit up sushi with some friends.  We met at the Tanked Fish around 5 on a Thursday to take advantage of their great happy hour - from 4:00 pm to close on Thursday!  Service was great and friendly - the bartender immediately greeted me and waited while I decided what to have.  I ended up going with the Sake Bomber - $4.25 for a GIANT bottle of Kirin and the hot sake.  Only complaint with this was that they give you a giant beer glass, and I prefer the shorter ones like they use at Kona.  My friend had the Guppy Bowl, a giant fish bowl filled with blue!  Apparently it has 5 or 6 types of alcohol in it, and for around $5 it's a total steal.  I declined trying it as I was afraid I would go on a Guppy Bowl binge, and wake up 5 years from now, living in a box, wondering where it all went so wrong.  Sushi time, caterpillar, dragon, eel, tuna rolls all good, solid picks.  The rolls were nice sized, and put together quite well.  All the typical stuff came with it.  The portions on the cooked appetizers like the coconut shrimp looked decent too.  Overall good sushi, but when you add in the value, totally worth it.  They actually had enough stuff on their menu I think it will take several visits to try everything.  Any place that has such a great happy hour is worth additional visits.

Wow, did they ever fix First Fridays. I had almost given up due to the distances, the crowds, getting pushed off the sidewalk by goth kids with glowsticks and cloves.  Now it's so much better!  I mean you still get to say "look at that effin hipster" every five seconds, but now you are doing it from a nice, safe and blocked off Roosevelt.  Everything is accessible, no more scary walks down by vacant lots to get to the next grouping.  I got see Imperial Storm Troopers (I bet they were sweating up a storm!) 2 of the 4 Ghostbusters, the Sisters of Mercy and a guy in a pink fuzzy suit (possibly a teletubby?) who gave me a totally free hug!  Took the light rail down, had a nice dinner, walked off part of the pasta, checked out some art and had a great time people watching.   The decision to consolidate the First Fridays area was a stellar one, and I will be back for sure now - I just may wait until it cools off again.

When the weather is cool, i.e. I don't burst into flames when I walk outside, or sink into the tar pits that were once the street, getting outside is the perfect way to spend a Saturday. Heading down to the Phoenix Market is awesome.  While it had been a while since I was 1) up early enough to make it down there and 2) I wasn't too lazy to head downtown, I was so glad I decided to go this past weekend.  Fully pet friendly for well socialized dogs, Guinness and I headed down to check out the goods.  First, I was impressed with how much bigger the market was than my last visit.  Tons of vendors, all under tents, so no sunburn for me!  While you will pay a premium price for the smaller growers, the quality is usually top notch.  I was a good girl, and didn't go crazy, but I now have a wish list a mile long.  If its not *too* hot, I think I will try and hit them up again.  Otherwise, I might just have to wait until the fall.

Mack's used to be our preferred late night stop.  When my friends and I all worked 2nd shift, this was the best neighborhood bar we could go to.  I'm not sure if it's management and staff changes, or if it's the new Dos Gringos that opened up next door, but something about Mack's just isn't fun anymore.    Service: Spotty at best - if you can find a server when they are busy, they make you feel as if you should be apologizing to them for bothering them.  They are great about clearing empty bottles and glasses of the table, but try to get a fresh drink - you are better off wading through the crowd and going to the bar.  Food:  The food is still good, but again, the service isn't - so unless you are ok with cooling food and waiting for a while, it's not really worth it.    Crowd:  Not sure what happened here, but the douche bag to human ratio has spiraled out of proportion.  It was always a biker type place, with plenty of normal people mixed in.  Now, it's full of obnoxious guys in polo shirts with popped collars who think groping you on your way to the bathroom is just good fun.  It may be that the frat boys are getting lost when they try to head to Dos.    Sadly, while I will still meet friends up there on occasion, it's not my first pick anymore.

I love this TJ's.  It's a great place to stop and pick up an nice bottle of inexpensive wine, or some kind of tasty treat to take to my parents house.  I love the selection of unique items here.  The samples are pretty good too, and they usually convince me to buy something new.  I like to poke through the cheese selection and find something new to nibble on, or pick up some fresh bread.  I also like the fact that they often have great prices on much smaller sizes of items - I don't have the room in my fridge or my tummy for the bulk sizes that many other stores offer.

Every time I have gone to Monkey Pants (and I love the name) I've had a good time.  The food, while usually not one of my priorities, is always good, and the guys always seem to dig the free pop corn.  About the only bar I will actually bother with a Juke box, but it's got a decent selection.  And the gimmicks, while just that, seem to work for this place.  I wish they were a little closer to my house, I would go more often.  And I love the 1 o clock shirtless shot - even when I was the only girl in the whole place - it was still fun.

You know my dog has it really tough.  After 8 hard hours of sleeping on my bed, he has to get up when I do, follow me around the house while I get ready and see me off to work.  Then it's outside for his sun bath, followed by 15 minutes of getting into stuff, and then a rigorous stretch.  Then a 4 hour nap, some sniffing, and then another nap.  No wonder he's so tired when I get home that he collapses on the nearest pile of laundry and proceeds to start snoring.  It's a ruff time (haha, I'm so flippin' funny.)    So when he's stressed out and needs a break, we head on over to Cosmo Dog Park for Yappy Hour.  There is butt sniffing to do, pee mail to check, and all kinds of activities.  If the car is dirty and the weather is warm, we go in to the lake area where he can fulfill his dream of being a water dog.  After some swimming and splashing, and of course some vigorous shaking (as close to his human as possible, because the only thing hotter than lake water in your mouth is wet dog lake water hurled at the speed of light) it's off to the big dog area, for some running, ball chasing and agility fun.  They have well constructed agility equipment - yay for concrete, good watering areas, and TONS of room to run and romp.  Plenty of nasty tennis balls to throw, and most people are good about the poop scooping.  The fact they have a completely separate area for small dogs is a huge plus too.    Overall, while this is more of a drive for us, it makes my dogs day to go out and have fun at the park, and the quality of this park makes the extra miles well worth it.  Side note: I'd love to kick the person who voted good for kids, dog parks are NOT FOR CHILDREN of the two legged variety.  Just because your kid likes dogs doesn't mean my dog likes kids.  He does, but I feel terrible when dogs trample toddlers, the screaming and crying gives me a headache.  Let me bring my baby (the furry kind that will never talk back) and leave your ankle biters at home.

Sometimes, you just need a drink.  Like when it's a Tuesday.  I mean come on, I put a good 2 days worth of work in, it's time to relax.    We headed over to Dos for Happy hour, and I was thrilled to find killer specials. $2.00 Pacificos and margaritas really hit the spot.  We sat at the bar, and it was clear our bartender was a real pro.  She remembered that I didn't like the lime in the beer, and seemed to know many of the other patrons by name.  We took advantage of the happy hour food prices as well, and I got the quesidilla, with steak.  It was delicious and melty and cheesy, all the things it should be.  Sadly, I was so stuffed from that that I couldn't try the amazingly loaded Rocky Point Nachos or the tasty looking queso dip my friends got.    Great value, great service and a good atmosphere, this Dos Gringos is a happy hour must.

For the second time, we have completed a light rail pub crawl.  I have to say, that so far I am very impressed with the light rail system.  For something that only opened in December 2008, it's already running smoothly.    The ticketing system is easy, as long as you read the screen.  Currently it's on an honor system, but for only $2.50 for an all day pass, it's better to be sure you have the ticket.    The trains have ample space, including bike racks.  Now, I do wish they ran later at night, we would use it even more if that was an option.  With the last train leaving downtown for Mesa at 11ish, you really have to pay attention.   I will use the light rail for any games or concerts I go to down town - it sure beats driving.

I'm still a big fan of the light rail! Sure, I can't use it every day, but it's about the only thing that will get me to head to downtown for a night out.    It's perfect for pub crawls, you can gather a huge group, keep everyone more or less together, and make frequent stops.  The extended hours mean more time for drinking!  The trains have stayed clean, they run when they are supposed to, and I've never had a problem.  The people watching is awesome as well.  Each stop is a mystery grab bag of the teeming masses of people here in town.   I just wish it had a wider range, I'd use it every day if I could.

Ok, so it's a fast food joint?  How wrong can they really go?  I went in here on a Tuesday afternoon around 1:00.  There was no lunch rush happening.  Apparently this location has problems with people stealing napkins and ketchup, because there were none of the self service stations where you can load up.    The person who took my order was incredibly rude.  There was no one in line behind me, and she kept trying to make me leave her counter while I was still putting my credit card away.  She told me where I could stand and wait 5 times.    They pour the soda there, and she had managed to cover the outside of the cup with as much liquid as was inside.  Oh, and asking for a napkin to clean up her mess....that's a big no no too.  As I walked away, she proceeded to have a conversation with another employee about what a bitch I was for mentioning the sticky cup situation.  In Spanish.  I speak Spanish.   When they did toss my food at me, I had to ask for ketchup and napkins.  They asked how many napkins I needed. I would have asked for more if I had known that EVERY table in their lobby would be filthy.  Honestly, I probably would have felt better about eating out back by their dumpster.  Finally someone did come out to clean the lobby.  Instead of wiping the table, she simply swept up a cloud, right next to me.    Needless to say, this had to be one of the worst Burger Kings I have ever been too.

Just went for lunch with a coworker.  We hit Moe's up right after they opened.  I had the Triple Lindy - which basically equates to the stuff you get on it, not the actual ingredients.  The black beans were good, cooked just right and plenty warm.  The steak was flavorful and tender.  Everything was proprietor well with no one item overwhelming the others.  I had the iced tea for a drink, and other than needing a lot of ice to make it cold, it was tasty - no sweetener needed (they also serve sweet tea if that's your thing.)    The chips, as always were fresh and tasty, nice an thin, and not over salted.  The salsa had good flavor and was a good consistency, perhaps a little thinner than I personally prefer, but not bad.  Overall, it was a good lunch, not too filling (because I didn't finish my burrito & chips) and not too bad for me and my diet.

Moes! Why did you leave?  I wanted a tasty burrito and you were gone! I can't believe you left me without saying goodbye, or at least leaving me a note (and a burrito.)

I'm not sure who's more in love with Tait, me or my 1999 Honda Civic.  Tait and his crew have been taking care of my car for the past 9 years, and I have NEVER had a complaint.    First, Tait is incredibly honest.  Tells me when a noise is cosmetic, or a cause for concern, and just how long I can wait.  Always upfront about pricing, and usually ends up being less than the original quote.  I have never had to go back for the same issue.    Even if I didn't love my Honda, I would keep buying them just to keep Hon-Man as my mechanic.    The only thing negative is (and I've told him this before) - TAIT - GET RID OF THE FLASH WEBSITE.....I hate waiting for that to play out when I just want your phone number.

One of my goals in life is to never have to do dry cleaning.....I like to be a wash & wear kind of gal.  Sadly, I am unsuccessful in this goal. I do ok most of the time, but occasionally I just have to get something dry cleaned.   If I have to do it, I go to Catalina.  First, they are super close to my house, and that works great for me.  Easy to pop in before or after work.  Secondly, they are a same day cleaner - in by 9 out by 4.  This is great for me, as I have a history of abandoning clothes to their fate at the dry cleaners because after 24 hours I forget they ever existed (until I am tearing apart my closet 6 months later wondering where the &%($ my dress went.)  They are always friendly and quick to help when you go in, and they take the time to ask about anything that might require special treatment.   The last, but not least reason I love them, is they are super cheap, and always have coupons.  I think the current price is $2.50 per item, but I could be wrong.  I do know they've raised the price from the $1.75 they were 8 years ago.  Overall if I have to get dry cleaning done, at least this eases my pain.

My favorite part of KUPD is the morning show, The Morning Sickness with John Holmberg.  I love the crews jokes so much I actually get disappointed when they play music.  The downside is laughing so hard you pee your pants on the way to work, so my advice is to stop wearing pants in the car.  Trust me, it will be to your benefit, and it may get you out of a speeding ticket.  (Following statement is not legal advice, nor should it be construed as such, tickets and pants are the sole responsibility of the reader.)  The rest of the day is good, lots and lots of good hard rock, without a ton of repeated songs.  You can also listen online, which is great at work when I forget my iPod.

Is it bad when the drive thru staff recognizes your voice? Beyond that, I'll never admit how often I eat Wendy's.  It's a fast food chain, the quality varies little and the staff comes and goes.  But a trend I've noticed at all fast food drive thrus lately is they want to hurl the food at you the second you pull up, and they barely wait till you have your drink/change/card in hand before they slam the window in your face.  How much do napkins really cost?  By the sudden scarcity of napkins in my bag (and not just here, all over the place) I am assuming they must be pretty expensive.     The biggest problem here, is that no one listens to the customer.  They listen for exactly as long as they need to to get the basics of your order.  By not active listening, they create this sense that we, the customers, are taking them away from something really important.     I don't go through a drive thru to validate my self worth, so I don't care if they don't make me feel special and loved, but for god's sake, listen when I ask for a straw, napkins or condiments!

I love the smell of bookstores - new or used it doesn't matter - you can smell the stories in the air.  I love to read, and can easily read a book a day, more if I'm sick or it's the weekend.  But I hate the cost of new books.  That's one of the reason I love Bookman's.    First, they have great prices on used books, and a huge selection.  There are all the bestselling authors you would expect, but also many hidden gems.  They also are very fair with trades.  I'll bring in a box or two of books, and while they are deciding which ones to buy, browse the isles.  It's very easy to get lost in there for hours, while I go through all the shelves.  Most of the books are in good to excellent condition, and by the time they have sorted my books out, I've usually managed to find enough to eat up the earned credit.    They also have a HUGE selection of magazines, DVD's and games.  The store is well organized, but because it's a used bookstore, also like a treasure hunt.  I love to scan the shelves for that unique looking binding (Who cares if I'm judging books by their covers!?!)  There are some chairs scattered throughout the store, so you can grab a pile and dig in, to see what you really want to get.    About the only thing I don't care for is the random crap they have - knick-knacks and paddy-whacks and random garage sale items.  Those take up space that, in my opinion, could be used for MORE BOOKS.  I'd rather buy crappy dust collectors at a regular second hand store.  They are still interesting to browse through, even if they aren't what I'm looking for.  Overall, it's good for your wallet and the planet - recycling books is a winner anyway you look at it.

Randomly popped in here before a hair appointment and was very impressed with the service.  One of the owners helped us, and took plenty of time to help us make up our minds about the order.  We sat at their outside tables and enjoyed our drinks.  Plan on going back and trying some of the food as well.  Did not try the wi-fi, but may make this a new place to work on homework from!

Sometimes, I hate being a girl. Like when you go into a hardware store and describe the doohickey that attaches to the thingie, and you get this look of pity from the staff.  I never have to worry about that at this Ace. The are always friendly, I can explain what I'm trying to do and wave random broken parts at them, and someone will figure it out.  Even if the person I find isn't the right person, they will make sure you get taken care of.

I recently purchased a vintage Kenmore sewing machine, and needed one little part for it.  On a friends recommendation, I came over to 35th Ave. (Don't let the name fool you, this is an East Valley location.)  They were surprisingly busy for a weekday evening, but had enough staff to help everyone quickly.  I really loved that they took the time to see the photos of my sewing machine to really help me out, and they shared my enthusiasm and excitement.  I could find what I need on e-Bay, but having the personal interaction, and the ability to easily return something that isn't right is worth waiting for them to locate the part for me.  I will be checking them out again for both my sewing and vacuum needs.

My husband and I decided to switch over our accounts and meet with a banker to get some general advice on where to go next with our money.  From the get-go the customer service was excellent.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in the bank, offered water and made quite comfortable.  Three separate bankers approached us to ensure we were being taken care of.  Ken, the gentleman we had the pleasure of working with took the time to get to know us a bit, and even had my husband and I take a test to see how our priorities aligned.  We discussed our immediate needs, our longer term goals and how we could explore additional savings in our day to day lives.  We opened an account and found the process to be quite easy, and for banking, surprisingly painless.  We have additional meetings set up to discuss some issues like refinancing our mortgage or perhaps even new vehicle.    This experience was excellent, and mirrors all the previous experiences I had when they were servicing a different account.  I am very glad we made the decision to move our money to Wells Fargo.    (*Full disclosure, my spouse is an employee, but not at a branch, or in any way related to the services we received.)

Outback is a perfect example of why chain restaurants work - you always know what you are getting....but the staff makes all the difference.  Dinner on a Tuesday night is never a major deal, and we were seated quickly, and had prompt service.  I ordered my usual "lady" steak - the Victoria (7 oz) medium rare - and I love the fact that I've never had a problem getting my steak cooked right - so many places bring me completely rare, or much worse - medium well steaks.  But this was perfect, and pared with a loaded potato, a delicious clich√© on a plate!  The real selling point for me is the bread.  That lovely, warm, soft, chewy brown bread.  I have been trying to figure out how to go and just eat that.   The portions were such that I skipped dessert, but it was a tasty meal with the comfort of knowing what to expect.

I know that some chain restaurants can be hit and miss, but this specific Outback always treats us right.   The Victoria fillet with horseradish is always my favorite, and it always is just the right amount.  And I can't say enough about the hot, fresh, brown bread - in fact, that's what usually makes me want to come in.  Our server was friendly and professional, and we got the Chocolate Thunder for dessert, and YUM! Keven isn't a huge chocolate fan, and I thought he was gonna start fighting me over the desert (not really, he's a super generous sweetie!)

I was a little hesitant of Zipps when we pulled in - didn't look from the outside like it would offer an awesome time.  Walking in around 7 on a Friday night revealed a place that was almost full.  We chose to sit on the chilly patio, which did have a couple of heaters.  The heaters were a little high up and less effective, but it was also one of the coldest nights this year.   Service was fast and friendly, we never ran out of beer.  I got the BLT on Sourdough, and so did my friend, her husband got the Black and Blue Burger.  The fries were good, but not as crispy as I like.  The flavor was great and I ended up eating all of them.  The BLT was awesome! Tons of crispy bacon, and they cut it so that you were able to eat the sandwich without bacon attacking you.  The sourdough bread was thick cut and lightly toasted.  The burger was a little less than we expected - 2 nice size patties, but the blue cheese could have been done a little better, and it was very messy.  The onion rings were nice sized and with great, fluffy breading on them.  The on tap beer list was a little heavy on the cheap domestics for my taste, but they did have an Alaskan Amber that went great with the food.  We were able to sit and talk for several hours, and the server made sure that we always had what we needed.

Yeah, I'm a girl. I frickin' love shoes.  I just hate seriously shopping for shoes.  If I'm browsing, then it's no problem, but when on a mission, it's a pain in the feet.  I stopped by this DSW before Christmas to look at the new Sketchers Shape-Ups and found a huge selection.  Using my phone (and the awesome bar code scanner apps) I easily ensured they had the best price.  So 2 (that's right, count 'em TWO) parse of shoes later, I walked out a VERY happy camper.  Sadly, I bought a somewhat defective pair, just a little loose bit on the sole, but for the amount I paid, I want a new pair.  Here's where DSW really started to shine.  I went in tonight, and showed the staff, they had NO problem. Sadly, they didn't have the size I needed in the color I wanted, but the employee who was helping me called their other stores, and then gave me advice on how to get the shoes replaced.  She even told me how I could get free shipping if I ordered the replacements online.  Other retailers could really take notice, DSW just earned all my shoe budget for a long time to come!

Any grocery store I can walk into wearing a green fairy costume (wings, glitter and all) and buy nothing but a bottle of rum and 2 cans of Redi Whip and get treated with nothing but respect is awesome in my eyes.  They usually have good deals, and the staff is friendly when approached.  The store is large, but usually well stocked and clean.  I love that they have the self service checkout, I prefer to bag my own groceries, and this is often faster than standing in line for a checker.

Did you know that there is a replica of an Irish Cottage in Downtown Phoenix?  Did you know that you can take Gaelic, dance or music lessons?  You can also rent the hall for parties, receptions and other events.  The Irish Cultural Center hosts an amazing variety of events.  C√©ili dances complete with lessons are tons of fun for the whole family, and feature great music.  Irish authors, poets, musicians and education experiences can bring you closer to your Irish heritage.  Throuout the year you can come for special events like the Solstice ritual, the Arizona Irish Festival, and of course, First Fridays.

We found this place due to its proximity from the light rail.  I'm a huge fan of Middle Eastern food, so I was thrilled to start our pub crawl off with some tasty food and hookah pipe action.  Because I planned on being out late, I thought I would indulge in a Turkish coffee....HOLY CRAP! It was HUGE.  I mean, seriously, it was like 4 regular Turkish coffees in one freakishly large cup. Didn't stop me from drinking it, but it was too strong for some of the others in our group.  We then had a sampling of various appetizer type dishes, and I was quite happy with all of them.  I would have liked it if a few of my friends would have been more adventurous, but hey, they found chicken on the menu and ate that.  After we ate, we smoked some hookah and watched hilarious Arabic tv.  Have no idea what was going on, but would have killed for subtitles.  I'd like to go back and check out the market for items I can't find at the regular grocery store, and I will be back again for more eats and hookah.

Ah, the great combination of tasty sandwiches, fast service and walking distance from work.    I eat here maybe once a month or so, occasionally more often.  I have always been pleased with the sandwiches.  They have a wide selection, and are always generous with the meats, cheeses and toppings.  A few times they have had trouble going with wheat when the standard bread is white (yuck!)  Other than that, they always get any odd little requests (like replace the cheese with bacon) correct.    My biggest disappointment is with the sides.  They have a red potato salad that looks AMAZING.  I mean, my mouth starts watering as soon as I see it - with a nice creaminess and a some fresh dill.  Sadly, it's about as flavorful as their Styrofoam containers.  No taste at all.  Not even salt or pepper.  I can't remember what the other side I tried in the past was, but none of their prepped salads have done anything than break my heart.  I mean, how hard is it to ruin potatoes?    The soups are good, as flavorful as the sides are bland, nice and hearty.    It's a small, narrow place, but perfect for a quick bite on lunch, or a very casual dinner.

After dealing with a few different allergy tests and getting no real results or options, both my husband and myself made appointments.    Dr. Schubert is a wonderful, very knowledgeable doctor with great bedside manner.  He sat down and did an old fashioned history and really took the time to find out what was going on with our symptoms.   When they did the testing, it was much more detailed and accurate than the quick kits that our primary care had used. They did some additional testing that revealed my husband is allergic to cats.  This explained a lot as we have 2 cats, one who would love all over him every morning.  With our allergies being as severe as they are, we started the allergy shot regimen, and our first 2 visits were a breeze.  While the shots probably aren't helping yet, the new allergy medicines have made us both feel much better.  I would highly recommend anyone who thinks they might have seasonal allergies or asthma to check out this office.

I love Fibber's.  Yes it's noisy as hell.  Sometimes the band sucks so bad it makes your life force drain right out of you.  Then you have a Car Bomb and life is good again.  They have a great selection of Irish Beer on tap, as well as hard cider, which isn't always easy to find.  The food is good, standard Irish Pub food.  The new patio is great, you can smoke and keep drinking your beer. The live music is great, especially watching drunk girls attempt to jig with no real idea how to do it.  It's a great place for a night out with friends unless you are looking for deep, meaningful conversation.

Met a friend here for post work, pre Christmas drinks and once again was happy with out choice.  Table service was fast, even though the bar was pretty full for a Wednesday night.    Stella on tap, and we both ordered the Sligo Sliders - Fillet Mignon tips, horsy sauce and au jus.  As usual, they came out perfect, just the right amount of crispy, battered onions on top, the buns toasted, and nice and hot.  A shared basket of their awesome, thick fries (really, more like wedges) completed the order and filled us up.

Fibbers, it had been a while.  Went down on a Wednesday night, and it was perfect for a second date. The background music was at the perfect level for conversation and the staff was friendly.  While I'm still sad that they took my favorite item off the menu, the food was excellent.  I had a chicken sandwich, and it was juicy and perfect.  Kevin had the shepherds pie, and loved every bite of the tender lamb.   Later on, there was some live music, but as it was one singer with an acoustic guitar, it was the first time conversation was possible with live music.  She played at the right level for the smaller weekday crowd.  Our server was great, as we moved from patio, back inside, back to the patio, and was friendly and prompt all night.

I will totally admit that I hire someone to pick up my dog's poop.  First of all, time is money, and my time is worth more than poop.  Secondly, my dog has defied all known physics on Earth - he can turn 1 lb of food in to approximately 15 tons of poop.  If that wasn't fun enough, he is apparently part Easter Bunny, as he thinks it's terribly fun to find new, exciting and inventive places in my yard to hide his poop.   Enter Pet Butler.  My poop angels.  They scoop everything up, regardless of where the dog has hidden it.  In the rocks, next to trees.  If Dr. Suess wrote about poop instead of Green Eggs and Ham, my dog would have pooped on the book.  Thankfully, he only does it outside...which is why we keep the books in the house.  But I digress....Each time Pet Butler comes out, I come home to a wonderful, poop free yard.  For 15 minutes.  Then the dog ruins it by manging to get one poop in 18 places.  But I can relax knowing Pet Butler will soon arrive like knights, not with armor, but plastic gloves, and scoopers instead of swords.    For $35 bucks a month, this service is worth every penny.    When I lost my credit cards they were totally cool when the billing failed, no harassment, just a nice email, and when I explained that I lost my wallet, it was, when you get the new card update us, no threats or bad attitude.  They even left us a cute dog calendar for the holidays.  (Do I get some kind of award for the most times the word poop is legitimately used in a Yelp review?)

Oh Dear Aunt Chilada, where did you go?  When I was young we would go out to eat on very special occasions.  I remember the excitement of going to Aunt Chilada's for birthday dinners and having a great time.    I'm not sure if it's the childhood memories not holding up, or the change in management, but Aunt Chilada's truly disappointed me.  We went with a part of four, and I was the only person who had been there before.  The interior and d√©cor was EXACTLY as I remembered it, meaning that in 15 years, I don't think they've even touched up the paint.  Once seated, we found that the room was very noisy, with only 3 parties in the room.  It was also extremely crowded, with tables much closer than they needed to be.  The service was adequate, other than sitting dry waiting for more drinks.  They did bring chips and salsa quickly, and the staff was polite.  Now, to the part that was so heartbreaking for me.  The food.  Meh about sums up what I thought.  I tried a little off of everyone's plate, and across the board it was so-so.  Nothing inspired me, nothing stood out.  While it's still better than Taco Bell, it really seemed like they were phoning it in.  There was no symphony of flavors, nothing unexpected.   All in all, this is a good place to take your East Coast relatives who can't handle spice, for a stereotypical Mexican meal.  It's kind of like the Disney version of Mexico.  For natives like myself, especially those who either cook their own food, or love a little spice and excitement, don't waste your time.

If you like beer - you will love the SanTan Brewing Company.  Not only do they have a great selection of microbrews, but also they LOVE beer.  Even their glasses are specially made to offer the beer drinker the optimal experience (like wine glasses).    The staff can't be beat, professional and savvy - they can take what you are familiar with and find something you are sure to enjoy.  Incredibly friendly, halfway through my first visit there I felt like a regular.    The food, while of the bar variety, is always fresh and tasty, I personally recommend the pretzels - the mustard they come with is worth the trip alone.    They have a decent sized patio, with an inside/outside bar service.  Misters help keep you cool in the summer, as well as an external ac that worked great even in August.

Just had a nice dinner at San Tan - made a big step for myself and tried the Sun Devil Chicken sandwich - a huge, meaty and juicy chicken breast, covered in San Tan's wing sauce and melty blue cheese crumbles.  It was so tasty and very filling.  Probably could have had some more sauce on it, but I was so happy the bun wasn't soggy and the texture of wet tissue.    Served with the beer battered fries, it was a terrific meal, especially when paired with my favorite, the Sunspot Gold.  I tried the new Epicenter Amber - and it's good - almost a sweet caramel like flavor, but very, very subtle.  My friend described it as "fuzzy" and after a few sips, I have to agree.  It's got a unique effervescence that I found interesting.  It's as if the carbonation is made of much smaller bubbles.   I just wish I didn't have to be responsible and go to work in the morning, because I would have stayed for movie night.

If your goal is to never hear a word anyone in your party is saying, then this is the place for you. Incredibly loud music managed to drown out any real conversation, and I am also assuming this is why the service wasn't that great - I don't think the waitress could hear us.  On top of the overly loud music, there were TV's playing sports everywhere, which really detracted from the atmosphere of the room.  Neat features like rocks in the middle of the room that added charm and a zen like calmness were overshadowed by the visions of football coming at you from every direction.  Geisha A Go Go - you don't need to be a sports bar, karaoke bar, night club and sushi restaurant all in one....  The food was good, and they had some sushi rolls that looked pretty interesting.  I went with the tepanyaki, which was quite tasty, and very filling and a good value for the price.  The service was interesting, long waits for drinks, and the food was brought out in no apparent order.  Appetizers appeared after full meals, and the easier items like lettuce wraps appeared a full 15 minutes after the tepanyaki box was put in front of me.  I would like to go and check out their private karaoke rooms someday, but as far as just going out for a social evening, this one will hit the bottom of my list.

It's a BevMo.  I love the selection, but I was disappointed that they never got my BevMo membership number attached to my phone number, as I didn't have the card on me, and didn't have time to fill out another form.  Fortunately, I knew another number that would offer the club price!    I went in for a birthday gift for my grandfather, what else do you get someone that just turned 71 but Godiva Chocolate Liqueur...hell, if I make it to 71 I'll drink constantly!  It was Easter Sunday when we went in, but the store was not over crowded.  The clerks weren't that friendly, but I'm letting it slide because of the holiday.  Had the service been just a little better, they would have gotten the elusive 5th star.  For now, until I go again, they will just have to suck it up at 4 stars.

First, I think it's important to know that I am not a huge fan of sushi.  Oh, I go all the time, but it's because I like the camaraderie and the saki....ok, mostly the saki.  That being said, I loved the sushi here.    The place is cute and clean, and the conveyor is just fun. I love that the plates usually consist of 4 rolls - that way I can feel like I can try something new without over committing.  The color coding helps us keep track of about how much we are spending too.  The service is friendly, and the beer is cheap, overall, it's a great place even for those like me who are not totally enamored of sushi.

Great neighborhood bar.  Plenty of inside seating both around the bar, and at tables.  Large exterior patio, complete with big screen tvs.  They usually have the UCF Fights on, as well as other sporting events, and those do get crowded and lout.  On other nights, it's a typical bar.  They do a pretty decent ladies night, my biggest complaint is that they play a lot of hip-hop, and I'm not a big fan.  Plenty of pool tables and a dart board to keep you occupied.  They go on and off of playing Name that Tune, so you might want to check, but if they are doing it, it's hilarious.  They also hold poker tournaments sometimes.  Prices on drinks are great, they have a good happy hour, and I have never been disappointed by the food.  Overall, this is one of my favorite places to just hang out with friends and beer.

I've actually had the pleasure of staying here twice now, the first time didn't rate a review because it was after my company holiday party, I was drunk, and crashing in friends rooms.  However that experience taught me that their staff, especially management is extremely tolerant of a larger herd of inebriated tech people moving through their hotel, but still stern enough to protect the sleeping guests.  The second time I stayed was after going to a concert at US Airways center.  From the moment we pulled into the parking garage, the stay was excellent.  The valet service was well worth the additional charge, the staff treated us like princesses, and everyone was extremely friendly.  The rooms are nice, well equipped - cordless phone on the desk, flat screen TVs (you can check out or order room service on TV) and ironing board, iron and hair dryers.  The BEDS, my god, the beds...pillow topped mattresses, not too soft, not to firm.  Super luxurious sheets, and a thick duvet and a feather blanket, added to the generous 4 amazing pillows per bed made going to sleep a treat.  I also love the thick drapes that block out all that nasty morning sun, letting me sleep in and enjoy the bed even longer.  The hotel facilities over all are nice - except the pool was closed.  The fitness center is top notch - actually better weight and cardio equipment than my gym - all of the cardio had a TV built in - just hook up your headphones and watch what you want, no having to share or any nonsense like that.  We walked around the ball room/conference room areas, and those all seemed well appointed, but we never felt like crashing any of the meetings, they looked pretty boring, and there didn't seem to be any free stuff being handed out.  The lobby bar actually has a decent selection of on tap beer, as well as the usual mixed drinks and what not.  The service there was fast and friendly, and it was a great location for people watching as the guests moved across the lobby.  The restaurant was good - we had the breakfast buffet, a wide selection of hot foods, pastries and cereals and yogurts.  They serve Starbucks coffee, which may not be a plus to everyone, but was still tasty and fresh.    After we checked out, they even held our bags and let me keep my car in the garage while we went off and did other downtown things - so I didn't have to go find my car or pay for parking elsewhere.  Throughout the hotel they feature local artists, some is amazing, some is interesting, but I love that it's local.  They also have some of the neatest floor lamps I have ever seen.  Overall, both times have been awesome, and I would love to stay here again.

I have two words for you:  Beer and Tapas.  For some reason, I am just in love with the tapas plate they have.  The hummus is almost as good as homemade, the garlic, well, it's worth smelling like garlic - and the olives push me over the edge.  The only downside is I usually have to order extra pita bread to finish everything up.  The beer selection is good, and the staff is usually very good at helping you pick if you aren't sure what you are in the mood for.  While not all of them go with beer, I have never had a dessert here that has disappointed me.    The atmosphere is laid back, and I've been in there when they were packed, and when they are almost empty, the service has been the same across the board.  All in all, a night at Gordon Biersch is usually fun enough to end with a cab ride home.

We were spending Memorial Day checking out thrift shops when we got hungry, and decided to stop by  for some food and a beer (or two).  We hit right at the lunch rush, but were quickly seated.  I had the Czech Style Pilsner, and my date tried the Hefewizen.  Both beers were excellent, full bodied and fresh.  The menu had so many choices, but we finally decided.  I had the loaded baked potato and salad, which was great choice.  The salad had candied nuts and lots of fresh veggies, and I even got the blue cheese dressing, which was creamy and fresh.  The Kobe Beef Burger was also tasty, only downside is they say they won't serve it less than medium. Guess they heard us, because it was still pretty pink when it came out.  The garlic fries were also tasty.  The staff was prompt and friendly, and the manager made the rounds to make sure everyone was enjoying their meals.  It was a perfect lunch for the last day of a long weekend.

Walked in about 7:45 on First Friday and were seated right away.  We managed to squeak right in between the post work crowd and the later diners, but the place was 90% full.  Service was fast and friendly, the waiter took his time making sure we understood the menu and explaining everything to us.  I had the Bavette al Cedro and my friend tried the Gnocchi alla Lupa, and we shared the lamb side.  Honestly, the pasta alone was good enough that I could have passed on the side, but I'm so glad I didn't.  Not sure how they prepare the lamb beyond the slow roasting, but it was tender and very moist.  I think I detected among the garlic and sea salt a nice touch of saffron.  My pasta was cooked just right, at first bite I was taken aback by how lemony it was, but quickly realized that the flavors were just perfect.  They balanced out in all the areas of taste.  I tried my friends gnocchi as well, and it was also just right.   The serving sizes were just perfect, not overwhelming, but not skimpy either. I walked away glad I didn't eat more and able to pass on dessert.  We each had a Four Peaks, I had the 8th Street and he the Kiltlifter, and my only complaint there was that they were bottled and not draft.   The whole meal was surprisingly quick, and the service was spot on.  I would love to go back and try a few more items off of their menu.

I have been going to this office for about 7 years, and have always gotten superior service.  I never feel rushed or ignored, and the entire staff is amazing.  While they are busy, so you want to schedule routine exams ahead of time, when I am truly sick and need to be seen, they always find a way to get me in.    I love the fact that they can take care of all the well-woman stuff, and they are very open to discussing options.  Of course, some decisions come down to insurance, but they are always up front about what costs, side effects and other options I have.  I have referred friends and family and they have all raved as well.

The new Uncle Bears is much more spacious than the one in Chandler.  I love the HUGE patio with large fireplace, great on the few cold nights we have.  They also have a large covered area with propane heaters.  Inside, it's pretty typical Uncle Bears.    The staff is friendly, the food is great, and the beer plenty cold.  We always have a good time, regardless of if it's Karaoke or just hanging out.    The only downside I have seen is that sometimes, even after 9 pm, there seem to be several children still around - and that bothers me when I am trying to have fun at a bar.  Hopefully management has addressed this in the past few weeks.

After a nice girls night out at the spa, we came down here for some food. The service was great, and while it was quiet on a Wednesday night, we were well taken care of.  We shared a sampler platter, which had all kinds of goodies - wings, onion rings, poppers and really good queso dip.  It was a perfect starter for 5 ladies.  I had the prime rib sliders, and they were perfect! The Au Jus went perfectly, and the buns were toasted just right.  Everyone else was happy with their burgers, wings and ribs.  The only complaint I have is that they REALLY need to update their beer list.  Many of the things on the list they no longer serve, but they had new items on tap.  Instead of Stella, I got an 8th Street, which was perfect, but the decision making was harder without being able to see an accurate list.

Wow, I am so impressed!  I had a coupon from the 2009 Entertainment Book, and thought, why not go get 50% off a wash.  When I pulled up, I was helped right away, and quickly found out they do oil changes as well.  This was perfect, as I was more than a little overdue.   They did not try to scam me with additional charges, didn't even try to tell me my air filter needed to be replaced, which it didn't.  Usually, as a female, these lube places try and screw me six ways to Sunday.  Instead, they did a great job, and were quick too.  The car wash was great, my car looked as good as a 10 1/2 year old car can look.  The waiting room has an assortment of the usual weird toys, cards and car accessories.  The outside area where you wait for your car is a huge covered area with tons of seating.  This should be comfortable even on the hottest days.  They have compressed air and blow all the water out of the cracks on your car, so you don't get drips as soon as you walk away.    Everyone was polite, professional and it was a great value.  My car should be staying clean now that I found a great place to keep it that way.

Oh, the brilliance of being right next to the Park and Ride for the light rail!  What more could a dance weary traveler desire than a nice pile of pancakes to soak up the alcohol in their stomach?    It's an IHOP, so I know what I want before I walk in the door.  That being said, this one always has good service, even at 3 am when 17 rowdy drunks walk in from the train.  I do recall telling our server she could "punch any of us in the face if we get out of line" but she never resorted to it.  She got our coffee and waters fast and right, and then the same for the food.  She even stood at the register and split the bill about 14 ways.

My boss, in his infinite wisdom, decided to compete in the Battle of the Bone wing eating contest.  So, in a show of support, wearing custom T-shirts that proudly proclaimed "Team Guza" we descended on the poor, unsuspecting Native.  Normally, Native is a place I can take or leave....but I have to say this one really did a great job.  They were busy and crowded, KUPD and the Bud Light girls were running around, there were people everywhere, yet our server managed to keep up despite being clearly understaffed.  I ordered a burger and fries, and of course it came while the wing eating was happening.  Now, maybe it was flavored by hunger and the thrill of watching grown men stuff pounds of wings into their gullet, but even cold, that was one terrific burger.  Even the rapidly cooling fries were awesome.  Sad to say, the food was the highlight, as my boss was soundly beaten, coming in 7th out of 9 - he did manage to eat 1 lb 7oz of wings, which makes me just a little queasy.    This was the best experience I've ever had at a Native,and would be willing to come back to this one again.

Where do I begin this review? With the charming and perfect outdoor pavilion? The historic house? The amazing Rev. Amy Miller?  Let's start with the venue.  Having attended a small wedding here before, we were familiar with the location.  We knew that even in late April we could still pull off an outdoor wedding in the evening.  Chapel at the Farm was everything we wanted and more.  So many amazing places for photos, rustic enough to suit our laid back style, and classy enough that tuxes and ballgowns made sense.  The mature landscaping was brilliant shades of green, the trees kept us shaded, and the breeze made the temperature just right.  As we had a confirmed guest list of around 75, the pavilion offered ample room, and we held both the ceremony and the reception there.  Rev. Amy is amazing - she knows how to get timing done perfectly, as we wanted to be pronounced at a specific time.  She has great patience with rambunctious bridal parties during rehearsal, and is always quick to answer any emailed questions.  The day of the wedding she was a port in a storm - calm, efficient and knew where everyone was at every moment.  I almost got bored because there was NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.  She, and the photographer (See my review for J Lynn Photography coming soon) made the details just work themselves out.  Having the house to get ready in was great - we did hair and makeup at my house before - but the photos from inside the house are amazing.  The wood floor, soft light coming through curtained windows all make for amazing shots.  Rev. Amy is a consummate professional, who was also warm and caring.  This was miles away from some of the clearly "I just met you" weddings we've all seen.  Best of all, I knew that Rev. Amy knows the business of getting people hitched, and I could rely on her suggestions for everything from Photography, Catering, Ideas and formats for vows and the ceremony, and I really respected her depth of knowledge.  Rev. Amy's vast experience also means she has vendors (DJ, Catering, Photos) that have all worked this space in the past.  Everyone worked together seamlessly, and I was thrilled with how easy everyone stepped into their roles and made the entire event run smoothly.  Trust me, it's well worth working to find vendors that all know each other - saves time, trouble and heartache that I've seen at friends weddings.  Her staff that helped close up when the dancing was done was just perfect.  Todd was always at hand to answer a question, but at the same time completely out of site.  He helped make sure that I had all my gear when it was time to escape to the resort and worked with our family and friends with the packing up of the things we brought for decor and all the mementos and presents.  The grounds were immaculate - and I loved the setup for the bar, being slightly away from the dance floor.  We saw all of our guests circulating and having fun.  I could not have dreamed of a more perfect day, and I know that had I gone anywhere other than the Chapel at the Farm, my memories would be pale in comparison to the ones I have now.

I wondered when they opened this place how it would do right next to Iguana Macks, or if Iguana's would suffer.  Both seem to do just fine.  We came here on a Friday night after pre-gamming at a friends house.  Even with full bar, the service was fast and friendly.  The whole crowd seemed to be pretty friendly and relaxed, which was great because a few of my friends were a little drunk!  The Jukebox seems to have a master control - they will turn off music they don't like and skip to a new song, so unless you are spending your money on mainstream hits, don't bother.  Not sure how much money my brother spent before he gave up.  My favorite feature of all Dos Gringos is the painted footsteps you follow to the bathroom.  Amazing how helpful that is after a few (many) beers.

While I really like their "WAHOO" (Wait at home or office) scheduling, I won't be going back.  I was having trouble breathing and was seen fairly quickly, but was only given a passing glance by the doctor.....no breathing treatment, just a really crappy antibiotic prescription and sent on my way.  Ended up getting worse and having to go to another urgent care, where I got the right treatment.

My mom loves this place, and we both love to support local businesses, so this was a perfect choice for dinner before heading over to the Orpheum Theater for a night of opera.  The servers were friendly, and the atmosphere is great, love the inside, all the little rooms of the old house.   Excellent outside seating, plenty of shade for summer, and a nice sized fire pit which is perfect for our mostly mild winters.  My friend had the Cucumber Martini and loved it, and the margarita and peach schnapps tea were also well received at our table.  We split a the Paradise Hummus for starters - and it was some of the best hummus I've had at a non Middle Eastern restaurant, but not quite good as homemade.  I loved the Arugula Pesto and Roasted Red Pepper variations, and the traditional was quite good.  Could have used some more olives as garnish.  The house made pita was excellent - except they fell into the same situation so many restaurants seem to.  Pita to Hummus ratio was WAY off.  There was no way the few slices of pita were going to be sufficient, and when we finally got more pita, well, I could have built a nice fort out of it and still had enough to finish the hummus.  I'd rather pay a few bucks more at the get go and get enough pita to do the job.  The portions here are quite large, and most of us had to get boxes for 1/2 our meal.  I had the Sirlon Steak Sandwich with fries - and it was good.  Not great, and the fries were fairly overdone, on the verge of burnt, but not inedible.  However, I think I was the only person who wasn't thrilled with their meal - the Coca Cola Ham, the Roast Beef, the Pesto Chicken and the Lavosh were all praised highly.   Everyone loved the seasoned cottage cheese as a side, which looked way better than the fries.  The house salad - not sure if it was the dressing, the greens or the way the two combined, but it was very bitter, and got relegated to the same pile as the fries.  Follow up service got a little slow, but at the same time, the place did get busier, and the staff was super friendly.  I'd still pick them over a chain any day, the food was better than most, and the atmosphere and staff were far better.

Came back again, and this time split the Greek Lavosh - the 1/2 order was more than enough for 2 of us. It was so tasty.   We sat outside and the weather was awesome, and the service was fast and friendly.   We missed out on the key lime pie, but I keep hearing that I have to try it, so I guess I just have to go back.

Do you like your teeth?  More specifically do you like them in your mouth where they belong?  How masochistic are you?  These are the two questions you should seriously ask yourself before making an appointment here.    While captive to my parents insurance plan as a minor, I was subjected to dental care here for years.  I am still paying the price today.    First, the attitude - a dentist with a God complex and condescending tone.  He regularly ignored basic questions, blew off concerns and treated us like idiots.  Second, pain management - I often had the experience of not being completely numb when work began, or having it wear off mid procedure.  I was then told to not be so sensitive.   He lied about the type of crown I needed, put in something far cheaper after charging us for the most expensive type, and then changed his story.    The shoddy work he did is still causing me to have work done today, and none of it would be needed if he hadn't touched my teeth.  This is the first time I wish I could give negative stars.

Girls Night In FTW!  My company does a MAJOR holiday bash - and we all want to look and feel our best.  So Serenity's Girls Night In couldn't have come at a better time.  5 gals from work booked a variety of services, facials, massage and spray tanning.  The staff worked with us all to schedule everything, and even sent us a nice confirmation itinerary.   When we got there, we were greeted by name, even though it was the first visit for all but one of us.  We had a couple people who had never had a massage before and were a little nervous, and the staff made sure everyone was comfortable with the process.    While waiting for my massage I was able to browse the various vendors who had come out for the event.  From Cookie Lee Jewelry, Pampered Chef and Tupperware to Scentsy Candles and Knock-Off Purses, it was a great shopping opportunity as well.  We all feel glamorous, relaxed and ready for the holiday party!

Love, love, love the beer selection! I also really appreciate the fact that they take the time to create a beer menu with so much more detail than just the name.  You can see what style, the brewer and even the alcohol content of each beer before ordering.  We popped in on the 4th of July to grab a bite and a drink.  The Pub Pretzels were soft, and the mustard and cheese were a perfect compliment to the San Tan Epicenter I was drinking.    The chicken tenders were breaded and had that nice crunch, and with the addition of the honey hot wing sauce, were a real treat.  Despite being busy, and apparently low on staff, our service was fast and very friendly.   Misters kept the patio area pleasant, and we were able to hear the fireworks, even if we couldn't see them.

I work next door, and watched the progress with eager anticipation.  Once Donna's opened, was I ever happy!  While they are still new, the menu options are well thought out, and the deserts look as amazing as they taste.  The croissants are some of the best I've ever had.   I usually get their lunch special, a sandwich, drink and desert for under $10.00. My personal favorite is the walnut chicken salad on a croissant, but the roast beef with wasabi mayo is awesome as well.   When they first opened, the staff was slightly disorganized, but that has seemed to fade as everyone is now trained and comfortable.  They are always friendly, and will give you samples of anything in the place.  It's my new favorite for a casual, quick lunch meeting.  I'm glad they are closer to my work than my house, or I'd be there right now!

Arrooooooooo!  I had a review started, and then I saw they closed.  I'm surprised, considering that on weekends they were pretty busy, and they did a great job with the Yelp event.    Sadly, they were just a little far for me to drive to on a regular basis.

If you've some of my other reviews, you know my dog is my baby.  He's family.  I can't just leave him home alone for a few days with a bag of food.  He gets lonely and sad....and then the trouble starts.  I hate the idea of kennels, I never know what kind of trouble the other dogs could be and I worry that he could get sick.   I also have 2 cats, and while they survive ok alone, with a big bowl of food, it stresses them out too.  And there's no way I can afford to board 3 animals....so, unless I never want to go on vacation again....  Enter John's Pet Sitting, which could more accurately be named John's Peace of Mind and Life Saving Awesome Pet Service....except that's a bit long....maybe John did pick the right name after all.  When I went to Portland for a week, not only did he come over 2x a day (I have a dog door, so the pup can go in and out on his own) and play with Guinness, he also checked the mail, removed those annoying flyers from my front door, brought in any random crappy newspapers.    The litter box was clean when I got home, the poop in the yard (well, I have a service  - see another review of mine, and did they get it easy that week) was scooped, and my pets were happy and healthy.  I also love that he's very upfront and direct about pricing, it's all right there on the website.  He and his wife who helps with visits, are both bonded and insured, and pet owners themselves.  I loved the fact that John came out at no charge for an "interview" where I could meet him, show him around, and watch him interact with me and my pets.  Guinness loved him right away. In fact, my dog keeps leaving travel brochures out for me....I think he misses John's visits.

When I say I walked in and felt like I was home, that's no hyperbole. It really was one of the most welcoming places that I've ever been in.  Everyone was super friendly, and fast and helpful service.  They know their wines, and helped me pick out a by the glass white wine, since my friends were drinking red by the bottle.  I love reds, but a sulfa sensitivity makes them almost impossible for me to drink.  We had already eaten elsewhere, so I didn't even get a peek at their menu but I'll be going back soon and trying out the food.  The live acoustic music was perfect for a mellow Saturday night, and wasn't overpowering the easy flow of conversation.  In fact, there were a few times it seemed like everyone was singing along, and then easing right back into their discussions.  I can't believe it took me so long to visit since this place is walking distance from my house, but I anticipate that I may quickly become a regular.

Hmmm, is it any wonder RadioShack has been having trouble?  After visiting this store, I remember why I don't normally shop here.  I only popped in because they were right next to the coffee shop I was at.  I spent 10 minutes in the store as the only customer, while the two employees completely ignored me.  Once I found the little $7 cable I needed, I stood for another 10 at the counter waiting for someone to ring me up.   When the clerk finally came up, he told me I had the wrong part....without even asking what I was getting or why.  Then he looked at the box, and realized, that even without his help, I had in fact gotten the right cable.  Amazing, I know.    Ultimately, even with the wait, it was still quicker and more convenient than going somewhere else, but I'd rather go out of my way than shop here again.

Should have checked my Yelp...  Came in here again on an emergency mission - looking for a cable to make my DVD Burner work so I could burn the memorial video for my cousins funeral.  So I may have been a little frazzled.  I walked in and stopped dead, not sure where to look.  They have all this crap up front now, it looks more like a toy store than a Radio Shack.  In fact, now that I think of it, I don't think there was a single radio in site.  I stand there , look around blankly and blink for a few minutes, when the employee notices another living, breathing person in the store.  I think it scared him, so used to being alone.....It was clear that I was taking him away from something very important and non-customer service related, and he really didn't like the intrusion.  I explained what I needed, and he didn't even try to look or help. Just told me they don't have those cables. Buh-Bye.  Didn't even offer a suggestion on where else to go, ask what I needed them for, nope, just a "Don't let the door hit you on the way out" attitude.  I fled, practically in tears thinking I was going to let the whole family down.  In the end, it all worked out, and I'm glad Radio Shack didn't get a dime of my money.

My car was filthier than a two dollar hooker during Fleet Week.  I was also in need of an oil change.  This location is right around the corner from my house, and they did a fantastic job.  I pulled in and right away was assisted.  I got the oil change and a full service car wash.   I love that they didn't try to up-sell me on all kinds of additional services, like air filters.  I did decline a decent deal on steam cleaning the interior, but I know they will probably offer me that same deal anytime I go, so I wasn't that worried about passing up the deal of a lifetime.  They changed the oil in about 15 minutes, and then washed the car.  They spend a long time going over all the cracks and seams with compressed air to blow all the water out, and then hand wipe the car down.  When they were done, I didn't even recognize my car - I had forgotten what color it was under all the Arizona dust.   (FYI - it's red).  I have a clean and happy car, and they even found a mailbox key that  had been lost for about 7 months!

This is my 100th review, so I thought I'd make sure it counted!  St. Vincent de Paul is a great charity thrift store.  When our Saturday plans of yard sale shopping were thwarted by the rain (I am still in Arizona, right?) we decided to hit up some thrift and antique stores and stay dry.  I've lived near this SVDP for years, but have somehow never made it inside.  We wandered in and I was immediately impressed.  For a small space, they have managed to get a lot of quality items in.  They are also better organized than most thrift stores - even the books (and this was a BIG selection) are sorted so it's easy to browse.  Then I saw it.....a 1950's Kenmore sewing machine - the kind build into a desk....  It was pure beauty.  When I asked if it worked, the staff brought out an extension cord and let me fire it up.  While listening to the gentle purr of the machinery I fell in love.  This was a great sewing machine, and it was clearly well used and well loved - it even had feet and attachments I'd never seen before.  I had no problem with the sticker price of $65, but then the staff informed me that it was 50% off that day!  So I got an even more amazing deal.  They were great about marking it as sold so that I could come back and pick it up later.    I know not everyone will find a deal like that, but as far as thrift stores go, I couldn't have had a better experience.

Popped in here on a whim one day, and wandered around for a bit.  Didn't actually want to really touch much of anything, I felt like I was in that show "Hoarders" but the hoarder had OCD....so it was slightly organized filthy crap.  The furniture in the back looked so sad, I can't imagine any other Goodwill in the valley accepting it.  Most of it looked like it had been scavenged from next to dumpsters.  I did end up buying a few of the bags of cloth they have, but only because they are for sewing projects and I knew I could dump them in the washer and sterilize the crap out of them when I got home.    I love going to thrift stores, but this was slumming at a level I could not have imagined.

After going to a different urgent care and actually getting worse, a friend recommended this one, which is practically next door to me, so score one for location.  Staff is super friendly and professional and there wasn't a long wait at all.  The Doctor was awesome, really spent some time getting to hear what was really going on, making the diagnosis and getting me the treatments I needed.    While I hope I don't need them often, this will now be the ONLY urgent care I go to.

$1.99 mimosas...that's right. $1.99 mimosas and Bloody Marys.  What a way to finish the morning after the Run for Literacy.  We headed over, and while it wasn't 11 am yet, they said we could order off of the breakfast or lunch menu.  The mimosas and marys were good - my brother didn't think the "Death Valley" was hot enough, but he's pretty weird.  I got a sweet & sour mimosa, champagne, cranberry juice and champagne, and it was wonderful.  Then came the food.  Our group split about even between breakfast and lunch, and the portions were huge.  While nothing on the plate made me weep for joy, everything was a nice and tasty.  My sliders were probably the smallest portion, which was good, I could barely finish what I got.  Several people in our group needed boxes to take their leftovers.  Service was a wee bit slow at times, but I am betting the management wasn't paying attention to the events, and didn't think they'd get a post 5k rush - listen up management, when Mandi wants a mimosa, she wants it NOW!  If they weren't so far away from me, I'd head back tonight to try out the steak, but that will have to wait for the next time I'm on the West side.

I've been here twice now with my mom.  We signed up for the "Preferred Customer" plan, and I'll admit, I'm still not sure how that works.  But, we'll keep it going for a little longer, because I could sure use the massages!  The massages are amazing.  So relaxing and they've done a great job creating the right atmosphere.  The second time we went in, we also got facials.  Two hours of being pampered! For multiple treatments, you get a robe and slippers, with a basket to place your belongings in - this makes the transition from room to room much easier, and gives you that blissed out spa experience.    The facial was good, and gentle enough while effective - can you say baby's butt - that's what my face felt like. After the facial, I moved on to the hot stone massage.  It was the first one I've ever had using the stones, and it was worth it.  The heat really makes a difference.  My massage therapist was professional, and had a very caring touch. Everyone in the facility is very nice and calming.  We had an issue with what we were promised when we signed up, and what was in the computer, however, the guy at the counter did what he could to make it right.  I think the owner just needs to remember what he promises - so if you go in and get offered a deal, make sure they note it!

Damn you Dunkin' Donuts! Why oh why did you have to open RIGHT ON MY DRIVE TO WORK!?!    Usually my sweet tooth can be defeated by my laziness, but no more - they even have a drive-thru!  Oh the humanity, oh the gluttony!    I'm not sure I believe that Dunkin' Donuts are the best donuts out there, but they have my one weakness - the chocolate creme filled. If you haven't had it, it's kind of like an inside out cupcake.  Buttercreme style frosting on the inside of a soft, powder sugar covered donut.    After eating one, you look and act like someone stumbling out of a nightclub bathroom in the mid '80's - shaky, hyper, wild eyed, and covered from the nose down in white powder.  So the big question is, do I change my route to work, or start working out?

It's a Dollar Store - I mean, what can you *really* expect.  It's clean and pretty well organized, and everything is a dollar.  I think 2 things are important to keep in mind when you shop at a dollar store.  1) Know what things cost - not everything there is a good value, you have to know how much a gallon of bleach costs vs the quart they might be selling for a buck.  2) Know when to GET OUT.  When the poorly painted ceramic figurine of a bear with a flower sticking out of it's butt starts looking good to you, it's time to go! There's some kind of weirdness in dollar stores, you spend too much time inside, and tacky magically becomes tasteful.  It's a great place to pick up cleaning staples like sponges, and I always get the aluminum pans and such for parties here.  Great seasonal item selections, right now I'm stocking up on pool toys!

We needed to take my parents out for dinner to thank them for watching our pups while our whole house was retiled - my mom had heard something about this place from a few friends, so we decided to give it a shot.  First, it's tucked way in there, I would have never even known it was there.  It was pretty slow for a Thursday night, but it did seem to pick up later in the evening.  After looking over the menu and the specials, we decided to split some appetizers and the special of a grill platter that night.   We started with the Carne Adovada Quesadilla - let me be the first to say I'm not a huge fan of pork (except bacon, god's most perfect food) but this was so tasty!   We added to that the Bacon Wrapped Jumbo Shrimp, which came with 4 sauces.  While none of the sauces counted as hot on our meters (AZ Natives are tough) they all had complex and well developed.    For the entree, we split the Grill Platter, a special for that night.  With the appetizers, it was perfect for 4 people to split, if it had only been 2 of us, the appetizers plus the platter would have been WAY too much food.  All the meats were done to perfection, and so much flavor!  Presentation and plating for all the items was nice too, it really elevated this meal to a truly nice evening.  The desert was a "brownie" with ice cream - but brownie is really the wrong word for it.  It was this warm, gooey, almost fudge like concoction, that was the perfect finishing note to this meal.  Even with a few beers, the meal was super reasonable - we did get happy hour prices for the appetizers, but I feel like our wallets were just as satisfied as we were.  The decor is charming, the booths create an intimate atmosphere, and the service was good.  Overall, this is going on my go-to list for beyond the chain Ahwatukee dining.

I really want to like Coach and Willies - Downtown Chandler needs more options.  This was actually the second time we came in here, but the first time was such a quick visit and so not memorable, it wasn't worth the time to yelp it.  Thursday should be a pretty good night for going out, and when we got there, it was pretty packed. They must have some kind of senior discount/early bird special, or a casino bus broke down out side, because for a sports bar, there were a lot of geriatrics chowing down.  We checked the sign again to make sure we hadn't accidentally wondered in to a Luby's by mistake.  Service was fair.  Not terrible wait times for order taking and drink delivery, but even with the place mostly full, I've seen better.  I will add that I REALLY wanted that beer, so any wait was hard to bear.  Food: Meh.  Kevin had the Black and Blue burger, which he said was good - I didn't try it but it looked like they just dumped some blue cheese dressing on top of a regular burger.  I had the "Prime Time" prime rib sandwich.  It said as jus and horseradish, which I was super excited about.    When my sandwich came, I thought they brought me a Philly cheese-steak by accident.  The good thing is, the meat was kept nice and warm by the thick layer of melted plastic cheese over the top.    I eagerly scanned my plate for the as jus - the WHOLE reason I ordered it, and GASP! It was not there! Had some nefarious person stolen my dipping juice?  After about 5 minutes, I was able to flag down our server (who was not who brought the food out) and ask about it.  Apparently, C&W Sticks the As jus INSIDE the sandwich for you.    This simultaneously deprived me of the joy of dipping, and made my sandwich soggy.  They did bring me a side of the as jus, which was fair at best.  Also, I had to really search for the horseradish, it was like they just waved the sandwich near it, rather than put any on it directly.....or maybe the as jus washed it away as they soggified the bun?  Who knows.  What I do know is that I was really underwhelmed with everything, the prices, the meal, the service. I'd much rather take my money across the street to San Tan or Murphy's Law then hang out in C&W again.  The best thing in there were some neat framed jerseys, except I don't give a crap about sports.

I found White Rock through my work, and have never been feeling better or happier.  First, their approach is much more holistic than many chiropractors I have been too.  Stretching, adjustment and trigger point massage work together to realign your spine.  Secondly, Dr. Bryson always takes time to make sure that she's covered everything that's bothering me.  About the only drawback is their hours, but since I work an off schedule, for most people it's not an issue.

Having switched to this office a few months after our daughter's birth, I can say now as she turns 11 months that I am so happy we made the change.  The office staff is friendly, the nurses are nice and gentle with the little ones. Something that is very important to me with a newborn was proper well and sick child waiting areas.  At this office they aren't just different sections of the same room, they are two rooms with no chance for kids to mingle about.  There's a pretty fish tank to look at and they have TV's in the rooms so that if their favorite movie is playing in the waiting room, they can finish watching and not be worried about their visit.  I have met both of the doctors, and a nurse practitioner, and I felt like they always took the time to make sure I had my questions answered.  I have never felt rushed.    It would be 5 stars, but on a few occasions they have had considerable wait times, my only complaint would be that they don't update a board that shows where each provider is on schedule.

We visited Arizona Wilderness for the first time to meet a friend, and I could not have been happier with the whole experience.  The wait staff was friendly and took excellent care of us.   We were there for a weekend lunch, so it was not crowded when we arrived, but even once most of the seats were filled the noise level was still quite nice, no need to shout to talk around the table.  The beer was excellent, since I did not write this review immediately after, I have forgotten what I had, but everyone at our table enjoyed their beers.  I had the Ruben Burger, and that has instantly made my top 5 list, and I freaking love hamburgers.  Now that I'm writing this, I think I should go suggest we visit them for lunch again soon!
