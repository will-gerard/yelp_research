First off I am extremely picky when it comes to bbq. So I always go into a new BBQ joint with high expectations. I came here with my boyfriend and he just ordered for us. A full rack of ribs, mac n cheese, collard greens, and corn bread. I picked up my first rib and the meat quite literally fell off the bone. It was juicy and exploded with flavor. Collared greens were cooked to perfection, and the mac n cheese was perfect. Oh then while I wasn't looking my boyfriend decided to order a piece of sweet potato pie...and I am so happy he did. I will definitely be coming back to try as many things on the menu as possible.

This place was suggested to my boyfriend and I from someone he works with. I want to give that man a HUGE hug. Cowboy Ciao is fantastic! We started with the Chopped Salad. I can't even put into words the party that was going on in my mouth. It hit every spot on my pallet! For dinner I ordered the Lamb and my boyfriend ordered the mushroom stir fry. Where do I even begin. Everything about the lamb was absolute perfection! I could have easily eaten two or three plates of just the lamb! I tried the mushroom stir fry and I can't even put into words how delicious it is. Of course we had to order dessert at this point so we got the Cotton cheesecake with the frosted flake ice cream. The ice cream was like nothing I have ever eaten. Light but still dense with the cereal in it. Bravo. The cheesecake was stellar. I will be going back and would recommend this place to EVERYONE!

I have been coming to Sake Bombers for years now and everytime I go it's an amazing experience. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The sushi is affordable and delicious! Hands down my favorite place in Arizona to have sushi!

Where do I even begin with this place. I ordered delivery from them due to their review on Yelp and on Grubhub. They were 45 minutes late bringing the food then when I called to ask where it was the delivery driver said he would turn back around because he was taking the food back to the restaurant because he "couldn't find my apartment." No phone call no nothing. Then when I finally got my food it was disgusting. The shrimp spring rolls were falling apart and had 0 flavor. Then the entree tasted like spoiled lemon. I will not be eating here again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Came in to eat after working at the Marquee. Way over priced for the experience. None of the staff seemed happy to be working there. Our server was actually extremely rude. And not knowledgeable about any of the food or the beer. So we just left. I will not come back into this location. Too bad.

I have always been a big fan of seafood but this place takes the cake. Between the warm inviting environment and the very knowledgeable staff my experience here couldn't have been more perfect. We had Casey as our server and he was superb. I would come back just for his service. My boyfriend and I had the oysters to start and they were absolute perfection. For our app what better the squid! Then both the squid ink pasta and the bouillabaisse were amazing. I would recommend this place to anyone who has a love for fresh and inventive sea food with a down home comfortable feel!!!!  If I could give more then 5 stars I would.

This is now the second time I have been into this vape shop and both times have been extremely enjoyable! They have a great selection of juice and the staff are great at finding exactly what you are looking for. My favorite is there house brand called Eternal Sunshine! Great environment. Great staff. Great products.
