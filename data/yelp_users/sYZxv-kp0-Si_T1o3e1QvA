My dad says this is his favorite store, I can see why. It's a mix of an outlet mall/swap meet/ "as seen on TV" section / of tools and just, all kinds of stuff! I am a girl who knows nothing about most of what they sell or how to use ( nor should be allowed to use ) the many power tools and other items they carry. However, I love this place. I browse up and down the aisle and someone is always available to ask if I need help. Maybe I look as though I don't belong, but I think it's because they have friendly associates. And the best part is that you always get something free when you checkout. A free tape measure, a free.." Electric thingy" that I obviously don't know what to do with. But it's going in my fathers Christmas stocking next year! It's a great and well priced tool ( and more) shop!

I really enjoy the food here. I feel like it is a healthy option and my 12 year like the food here too.

I love the atmosphere, and the food. I also like the service. The staff has been the same for the past year. They love their job and it shows. Just a good low key sports bar. And it's close to a really awesome hair salon.

I didn't care too much for some of the sides, and some of the food seems store bought. It is just ok.

The sides I didn't care for but the ribs were excellent. In fact after eating them and washing my hands, my fingers still had a faint smell of smoked meat. The meat is very good. I wish the BBQ sauce was thicker or more "authentic"  and unique, but that's a personal opinion and it comes on the side so you can chose to use it or not. I would recommend the meat and the cookies here, and to order online.

Eisela is an awesome hair stylist. She is very detail oriented with hair color application and she uses quality hair products. I watched her do a bridal up-do also, it was the prettiest wedding hair that I have ever seen! If I ever get married, I will have her do my hair.

I originally thought physical therapy was only for those who needed to learn to walk again. When my doctor gave me two options, one being monthly pain medicine for the rest of my life, or two- physical therapy, I found this place. The people are friendly, which I believe to be almost as important as being qualified in their practice as therapists. You are required to do various workouts and stretches that can be slightly awkward, and if in a different atmosphere, I don't think I would have done it. And I needed to. The time I spent had helped me strengthen and genuinely feel stronger and better. I recommend this place to anyone not only needing to learn to walk again, but for almost anything that someone might say take a pain pill for. Try physical therapy first.

The 4 star rating is for the food, because it is delicious! However I would give 2 and a half stars for the price because I cannot leave without spending $15 every time. ( the food is worth it I suppose) and I alternate between 2 and 4 stars for the service. Because depending on the time of day and who is working you will receive wonderful service or terrible service. I think the staff in the evenings needs to be evaluated, however as a whole it is great food. And the environment is clean.

This place replaced my beloved Greek eating establishment. ( I had one favorite menu item that I will truly miss) I would have never visited had it not been for my sons school receiving a donation of the sales tonight. I like when local businesses do that and we like to participate. So the charity to Aprende middle school got us to enter the building and the food will get us to enter again. Very fresh, healthy, and we both somehow ate for $6. ( with desert...) I had salad and my son had a sandwich and we had a brownie and another fancy desert ( fancy, so I am unsure exactly what it was. Salted brûlée something.. Yum!) I want to go back and try their soup. They had a lot of soup choices and they all looked good. The building looks new and was clean. We took our food to go and actually ate in the hobby lobby parking lot... But hobby lobby is another 5 star review. I love that place too!
