My favorite place to treat being sick, hungover or just really hungry. The menu is good size without being overwhelming like other places. My personal favorites are the spring rolls, the fresh sliced beef rice noodle pho and the basil fried rice.

They advertise that they are open 24 hours a day seven days a week, however, they are closed early between 330 and 430 in the morning. Garbage.

First time being here since it opened. The bbq French fries and atmosphere was great but our server Maddie was the best! Fast and attentive service with a big smile on her face the whole time. Will definitely come back and see her again.
