Keep in mind i did NOT eat here. So this post is not about food quality. its about the service  it was like i wasnt even there when i waited for 30 minutes before the bartender asked if i would like something to drink ofcourse as soon as a girl came up to the bar the bartender would run over like a little puppy hoping to his ear scratched

So i experienced this place twice  the first was great, Why?  because this lady with a black eye was the bar tender  this lady fell down by the restroom (she was completely messed up)  and stayed on the floor claiming that the floor was wet   The second time was funny, Why?  because attached to this bar is a pizza spot where they cut a hole in the wall so people at the bar can order food at the place next door with out having to go outside ...anyway one of the cooks from that establishment next door was at the bar drinking while working...he was a young kid.  Anyway it was funny because he would run from the bar to his work to make food then run back for drinks and i couldn't stop from laughing at the amount of times he did this   So if you like GETTO, this is the place for you..

The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service.   It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals....   I'm not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer.   Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states "the manager is off till next week."   i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard

I'm torn with this place because i love it so much but dislike it for certain things so I'm going to stay positive because the things i don't like can be a personal thing about the music they allow in there   it has a HELL a lot of beers  it has a grand selection of wine  it has no food, but who need food when you've eatn before going to the LOST LEAF  the music is a hit and miss  some days a very kool unique style and other days not good   and i think this is why i sometimes have a problem with the music is because with all the great local musicians out in phoenix it should be easier to play this place but it isn't...

i wouldn't spend my money here any more.  food is average  This is odd but I've eatn Zpizza four times, three of the times its been take out from the hospital where we all threw in to get a few pizzas but my last experience was at the Thomas location and there was a girl employee that seemed to cough all over peoples pizzas and she didn't cover her mouth, gross (she must be a smoker)   Good bye Thomas Zpizza, never again

although it may look like a groove place from the outside my first visit will be the last.   sad to think that so many people think this place is good.   Food was below average, service was OK but i asked for my drink and got it 20 minutes later. i use to bar tended so i understand how busy it can get but wow! they didn't even care that it happened

small drinks big price, food average  the best thing is the establishment itself  if you go take a trip to the restroom, and look down the elevator shaft thats the coolest thing about it

What is it about a location that is so attracting?  well for starters attractive clientele.  great food  great drinks   Postinos is awesome, i love the beautiful ladies that go drink and eat there. I love the food and beer/wine selection, and the extremely attractive ladies that go there...oh did i say that already   i have to say i wasn't going there on Wednesdays because they had live music there but last night i was informed that it has stoped..so with that said i do give this a four thumbs up location..(two hand thumbs and two toe thumbs up)   i venture often to people watch and enjoy a good salad  try their raspberry salad..

Bad can get worse, Two Hippies started out OK with the burger shop and taco shop but everything else is not worth your time. Pizza and breakfast isn't where Hippies should be. Service was OK for a hippie, Food less then average. I'm glad to have had experienced it, that way i wont ever go back

All i can say about this place is Awesome!   i love the location, another phoenix vibe with the little house converted to a sweet dinning and bar   i went there once and have returned 3 more times and have not been disappointed.   this is the place to be when you want great food and reasonable price drinks   great place to see attractive humans

We were greeted at the door by two lovely ladies. The place was not busy yet they said that it would be a 45 min wait to be seated out side  So we took the first available  15 minutes later after I spoke to the bartender and asked him why the wait for a table outside was 45 minutes yet no one is here. We were seated   Food options seemed interesting but NOT for the price Atmosphere is great  If u want a quiet spot wait to go to this place when construction is done in downtown because they are building a Tilted Kilt pub upstairs and it was nosier then the people eating dinner    If u are a very wealthy person (your salary is more then 100,000 by yourself) u will be able to afford eating and drinking here

It is a new lounge. I not impressed by the special drink menu   The food is great and of course the ladies that were eating are Phoenix sexiest.   So if u like food and beautiful people. I would check it out  Sound Propagation gives it's stamp of approval
