This is probably the best subway I've ever been to. My son and I come here often. Usual drill is I pick him up after school and we grab a bit to eat cuz he's "starving" (teen boy is always hungry). He likes subway and with the $3 sub of the day deal it doesn't kill my pocket. :D That's not why I prefer this subway. It's the people. They're sweet gals, happy and even though my free cookie coupon is expired they still take it.   The restroom is clean too!

Not as great as we had hoped, heard and read.  A couple of my girlfriends and I came here for Brunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was noon but still cookin up brunch meals. I was happy bout that since I was excited about tryn their Chilaquiles. They also had a Bloody Mary bar going on but since I'd had my fill of drinks the night before at the Chandler Craft Drinks Festival I decided to give my liver a rest and not partake.  A friend and I order the chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. My other gal pal ordered the eggs Benedict w chorizo sausage patty. We wait.  Not long after our food comes. It does not look very pretty. The filet minon strips were way over cooked. The beans looked dry and the main course, chilaquiles looked like a slop of mashed up, over cooked enchiladas. Eggs weren't mixed in they were on the side. Ok so whatever it doesn't look good. I can get past that if it tastes good. Well it didn't. The chilaquiles tasted like a spicy masa (over cooked and mashed up corn tortillas). For those of you that don't know chilaquiles is diced up corn tortillas pan fried to a light crisp w eggs and enchilada sauce, meat added optional. What was presented was not at all what I was expecting or used to. My friend was so disappointed that she requested chips to substitute her need for a lil crunchy tortilla. Plus she was even more upset because the menu clearly stated that it came with queso fresco and crema (sour cream) and it came with neither.  I check in to take advantage of the free chips and salsa offer. We ate what we could muster, which wasn't much. However my friend that ordered the Benedict loved it! The waitress was kind enough to take our chilaquiles dishes off our bill. I should've known better than to eat out at a Mexican food place. I'm always disappointed. Nobody cooks like moms.   The place it's self is cute. A lil dark inside which is nice during the summer heat days.

I enjoyed the time my husband and I spent there. Meant to have a Long Island Ice tea as I hear they are "the bomb". I played it safe with beer and a tequila shot :)  Loved the music, had a blast playing pool. My husband enjoyed playing pool also, isn't into loud bass pumping music like iam :) Because it is in ASU town expect a college crowd ready to party. It was slow when we arrived around 10pm but was pretty crowded by midnight. BTW they take checking ID's very seriously.

In a pinch we stayed here for NYE block party because the Marriott residence inn in downtown Tempe was booked. This turned out not to be too bad. They shuttled us to the party, but we had to walk back (about a mile) since they stop shuttle service at 10pm. A couple days after checked out i realized i had left a couple of items in our room. I called back they searched and found them. They offered to fedex it which was a nice gesture but decided to pick up instead. Overall I'm Impressed with their customer service which is always a winner in my book.

Buffets are played out in Vegas. I never get my money's worth at them anyway since I don't eat very much.  Son and I chose this place hoping that the food was as good as the Yelp deal....It was! Sweet group of ladies that work here. They've got that good ol southern hospitality.  We walked into the place about 30min before closing. I was expecting to be rushed with ordering by an annoyed waitress because it was close to closing time, but instead was greeted with a welcoming smile. Even tho they weren't rushing us I didn't want to be that be that one that kept them after hours so we quickly placed our order-full slab of ribs, greens, and Mac n Cheese. My son asked if they had spicy BBQ sauce and our sweet, young waitress with that lovely southern accent said "no but we have Louisiana hot sauce you can add to it, would you like me to mix it in for you?" My son, "oh yeah, smart! thanks I can do that :D" The greens had a lil kick to them, the macncheese was very cheezy the ribs were just a lil dry but the BBQ sauce alone was so good!  We were glad we decided to share our meal because it was more than enough for us and all very good.  We were wrapping up and still I was expecting them to rush us out, but instead of bringing the check they brought over the dessert menu. We declined since I knew it was about closing time.  Son and I left with smiles on our face as they thanked us for coming "thank you ma'am, now you two have a wonderful evening"  Im all about customer service so it's an easy 5 for me. I'd come back for that and to try some cake next time. :)

Nice sized dog park! A lot of running space for the dogs. A fenced in area for the little pups too. People here were really friendly. A couple dogs that were a little feisty but nothing that was out of control. My dog, Roxy, didn't play much only because she's not used to it. We were just visiting since we were in the area. People seemed to be cleaning up after their dogs too. Grocery pages around the fence, trash cans outside the fence, which has a hole to toss your poop bags and trash into the garbage bin. Good idea I thought. Doggies can't piss all over the bins.

This dog park I like. It doesn't compare to Paseo Vista but it's up there. This park has a lot of trees providing much needed shade especially during the summer months. The dogs that come here are all pretty friendly and play nice. Pet owners are responsible, friendly, and pick up after their dogs so it's a clean park. In the center there is a obstacle course play area for all dogs. There is not a separation for small dogs but like I said owners here are all responsible and watch their dog. The lil ones seem to play just fine w the big dogs. They also have a lil kiddie play pool for the dogs to play in, my dog never was a fan till now :)  Compared to the Tempe sports complex park this one is waaaaay better.

They took me in when nobody else could help me! I was in severe dental pain and they got me in during a holiday weekend. They're a bit of a drive for me but i come because of their awesome customer service. Dr. Chad Whiting & his entire staff are super friendly and sincerely care.

I used to like this place. Today i went for lunch and the price i paid ($7) for a 2 piece combo meal was waaaayyy over priced! The chicken pieces i got were tiny. More like half a thigh & leg. The black beans and veggie's  i used to love. THink they switched up the black beans brand and im not a fan. The veggies were hard, not steamed. Overall im disappointed with the changes. I dont think I'll be going there as often anymore

I come her for the margarita's. It's really the only thing that has kept me faithful to macayo's. The menu has changed and i can taste the difference. I do really like their Baja chicken burro. The patio area is always nice. The bar area upstairs is due for a renovation.   Overall the food is ok the drinks are good the location is great.

This review is for the dog park only. This park does not accommodate dogs that like to run. It's small. Maybe we've been spoiled with the bigger parks like Vista Paseo and Shawnee. Seems to be the place for an older crowd with smaller dogs. The dogs that are larger seem to just lay around and not play. The biggest dog here is a bully. Barks and growls at any dog that is larger than pint size.  I wanted to like this place since the view is so beautiful but it's just not our type of crowd. We need fun, energetic, positive dogs and ppl.

I actually thought this place was pretty good. The wings reminded me of Native New Yorker wings back home in AZ.  We ordered the full order of hot wings for $15. Our waitress was sweet and our order came pretty quickly. We ordered half hot and half atomic hot. We couldn't tell the difference, both were good and hot, just like we like. For some reason though my beers seemed to take a while to get to me, which i didn't like. I think she simply kept forgetting about them. The place had a a big bar area with a small stage for music entertainment during the evening weekend hours I'm assuming, since nothing was goin on while we were there. Lots of Tv's which pleased my son and I as we like to watch football while enjoying yummy wings.  If I'm ever in the epicenter in Charlotte again I wouldn't mind stopping there again.

Hubby and I were looking for a place to stay for the weekend once realizing that the JT concert and 1st cardinals game were scheduled for the same night. We knew it be busy and didnt want to fight traffic there and back. However we started our search late (the night before). It was booked everywhere in the area. My husband being a Marriott Platinum member called the Residence Inn and to our surprise they had room for us even tho they showed "full" online. fYI they reserve about 10 rooms Especially for their platinum+ members till 6pm the night before. The girl that helped us was super friendly and greeted us w the same happiness when we arrived.

Horrible service & food at this particular Thai Basil. Thai is supposed to be spicy right? Not here! When we asked for Chili oil they were clueless and called it salsa! WTH. We ordered the lettuce wraps appitizer which took a while to get. The lettuce was chopped into small pieces which made it difficult to eat as a "wrap". My friend ordered curry, I ordered the Pad Pak, and my fiance ordered the Drunken Noodle. Curry was served long before my fiance and I recieved our dishes. They knew they messed up by bringing out the curry so early and tried to cover by asking if my friend wanted to share her curry with us. WTH! umm no we all ordered diferent dishes that should've come out with hers. If she had wanted to share she woulld've offered, and asked for bowls herself. Geez!

This location is also a u-haul rental location; however, I do not recommend picking up at this location.  The truck we got was banged up and dirty. There was a bug collection goin on all. On top of that the car dolly they were going to give us had tire straps that were completely ripped up which would have in no way been able to safely secure my car during our cross country move from AZ to NC. They didn't have a backup dolly so we were forced to drive to another location that only had 1 person working at the counter. This whole ordeal caused us to be behind schedule by 2 hours. :/  To the employees, can you please ensure that the equipment you rent out is clean and safe to use. Seriously my car could have snapped off and killed someone! To the renters, you'll be payin for it so always do the double check. :)

Very pleased with my first visit. Dr. Ho seems to be an honest, not out for your money, kinda guy. He gave me 2 options for my sensitive tooth that seems to be cracked.  one was the less expensive route and the other was a semipermanent solution that would've had me back in the chair with what sounded like an evasive procedure. He explained the procedure well which i loved because I'm all too curious how it's done.  It was a difficult decision for me to leave my last dentist, Dr. Chad Whiting, but this place was just so close to home. I will miss all of the ladies at that office. All Brite Dental ladies are very young and nice but not as awesome as Canyon Rim Dental ladies. My choice to switch was based on convienance and the good Yelp reviews Dr. Ho recieved. Thanks Yelpers! Ya'll never fail me

Had been craving Indian Food for a couple weeks. This place did ok with fulfilling my fix. What i enjoyed was the friendly service. It's a Sunday evening and hubby and I found the $10 for $15 deal on yelp and decided to give it a try. We were the only ones in the place so the young lady was able to give us her undivided attention. She explained the dishes i was curious about and actually offered up a couple samples. I absolutely loved the chicken sheesh kabob that she highly recommended. I asked for spicy and it was! It's minced chicken w green chili and Indian spices rolled into a shape of a sausage. Not on a stick. We also tried the Chicken Boti and the Chicken tikka Marsala (we like chicken) those were good just not as spicy as I like it to be. We plan to return to try the lunch buffet.

Wish i would've known about this place yesterday (sunday) since they were open and my teenager tells me at the last minute that he needs a sports physical for basketball tryouts by Monday after school!  Staff here is super friendly and funny  We will be back, especially since physicals are only $35 no appt necessary.

Super happy and friendly staff.  Very pleased with the service so far. Was searching for a place to get my wedding dress dry cleaned since it is completely filthy from dragging around from our outdoor wedding and cake fight evidence. :) I called other places and they were quoting me $100-$200!!  Stopped here on accident looking for another cleaner. I saw they had 30% off posted. Lady quoted me $77 for my dress. Uh yes I'll take that... I'm a happy girl!

This place used to be Ashley Manor and I was super excited about it opening. Although I had already booked a place for  our  wedding,  I just had to take a peek at the newly renovated venue. They have done a wonderful job so far. The garden area offers many different ceremony locations and the reception hall was big and beautiful. The Brides quarters and the Grooms quarters were separated and roomy with a huge kitchen included. Loved the place and the people. Leslie and Chad were fun and had great customer service   I wish the business much success.

I love My Sisters Closet and now they have a Thrift Store! Even better, all profits are donated to non-profits in our community! I posted a picture of the list of where proceeds go.  I was on my way to Goodwill in search of some home items when i had recalled reading about My Sisters Charities Thrift Store in the local paper. I had been meaning to check it out. The place was clean and organized. It's a small place so it wasn't overwhelming or daunting to shop. I had to check the clothing items (not what i was there for but the shoes and dresses were calling me) found many name brand items. By the time i checked out i had 4 dresses, pair of shorts, earrings, and a pretty green ceramic vase all for less than $40.    This place has won my business. Sorry Goodwill, you've been replaced.

It drives me nuts when restaurants close even five minutes before closing time. I find it to be poor customer service.   I called 20 min before closing time to place my order while on my way there and the lady said it will be ready for pick up in 5 min. Whoa that's fast food! Ok but considering I'm paying $12 for my dish I'd hope they'd put a lil more love into it.  I get there 5 min before closing and the closed sign is up. :/  Worker inside sees me and brings out my order of the Evil Chicken Jungle Princess. On a scale from 1-4 I ask for level 3 spicy. Oh Btw they give you a 10% discount if you pay in cash.  I get home, open up my bag and am already disappointed. The serving size failed in comparison to other Thai places. The dish did not have enough veggies as it should have. It consisted of mushrooms, chicken some onions and a lot of coconut curry, and it wasn't spicy, not like I had expected from a level below the spiciest. Maybe it's because I'm Mexican. I like it really spicy.  I'll stick to my favorite, Thai Rama in chandler. They do it right and cost less.

I've been to this carwash now 3x's, and it's not even that close to home. I will say that the "free upgrade" does have a lil something to done it. BUT for $5 for a quick decent carwash is not bad, unless your lazy and hate putting in a lil work yourself.  Upon arrival, which btw you can't get into off of University. Entrance is on Priest, I always forget that. Once in you're greeted by an employee. Which I appreciate since I wouldn't know what to do w the Yelp coupon at a machine. I like that they don't solely rely on a machine to assist and take your money, even though they are a cheaper carwash. The wash its self is eh. It doesn't quit get all the dirt off, but for $5 it's good. Since I was a kid I've loved going thru the carwash while in my car. Then once your car is spit out, make your way to the vacuums. Here you will make use of yourself and vacuum  your own car, which I like cuz nobody know what spots to hit better than me. However Every time I have gone an employee makes his/her way over to me while I'm vacuuming and asks if they can help. Usually I decline but they do something helpful anyway like windex my windshield or spray off excess water.  As long as the Yelp upgrade is offered, or I'm in the area, or need a cheap quick wash and a vacuum I will return to this spot.
