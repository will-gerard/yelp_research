J crew is my favorite store so already I might be a little biased, but the customer service at this location struck me as particularly good today. One of the guys who works there, Tom, introduced himself to me when I came in the store and then continued to refer to me by my first name the whole time I was there. I couldn't believe he actually took the time to remember it, I liked that. Another man who worked there was also extremely helpful and complimented both what I was wearing and what I intended to buy. I loved my experience today and would absolutely choose to go there over the fashion square location.

I just discovered, well my roommate discovered the most delicious new drink. It's a coconut milk / almond milk blend. It's so good you guys you gotta try it. It has that mild coconut flavor and the thickness of almond milk.   After I grabbed a bottle of the blend I stopped by the coffee place on my way out for an Americano. The lady in front of me asked if they were still out of espresso and they were. I was sort of disappointed about that and went with just regular iced coffee instead. It was good but I think it was a little too pricey considering it was just a coffee. I would definitely want to try one of their smoothies though all the ingredients looked like they just belong together!!

I really love this place and go about every two or three weeks. It's $8 for a polish change, $20 for a full pedi including a hot stone massage, and $15 for gel polish. They are definitely reasonably priced. One of the girls will try to up-sell you as much as she can so pay attention to that if you don't want to spend the extra cash. I was in a hurry this week and they were able to so my toes and nails at the same time which was awesome. Lots of gel polish colors to choose from.

I think this my favorite breakfast places in Scottsdale so far.  The Bloody Mary was super spicy and pretty dang strong. A little bit pricy though, $10 for a pint glass. I also had an iced Americano that was really good.  So I never order pancakes out because I don't usually like them but I was really in the mood. I got the sweet cream cakes just plain with butter and syrup on the side and seriously I think they're the best pancakes I've ever had. Also the presentation of all the dishes is so lovely it's almost hard to dive in to them!   I have to comment though that the service at the bar wasn't the friendliest I've ever experienced, but really that's the only negative.

Awesome Attentive service. We got our drinks almost as soon as we sat down which was awesome. Such a fun place to go after volleyball at ISP down the road. I had the buffalo chicken salad which was so good. The chicken had a ton of buffalo sauce on it which I really love. Several people got the fish tacos which also looked really good.   They have a special margarita that's only $3 during happy hour which I believe is after 10 pm. They also have blue moon and some other domestics on tap. We all had a great time and really enjoyed our experience.

Looked all over for a Smith Optics dealer in Scottsdale and finally found these guys. They didn't have exactly what it was looking for but got out the catalog and ordered sunglasses for me that night. It took a few days for them to get in and they called Me right away to come pick up my new shades. Such nice guys who work here I will definitely be back anytime I need smith products. And I want to look around a little More next time also!!

Went here tonight with my family for a birthday celebration. It was so much fun!! Be prepared to look good though for this restaurant!! I thought my dress was nice till I saw the other girls. Then I just wanted to go home!! Haha : )   Our server Joe was excellent. He was super enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu. The bussers came around and cleared plates and refilled drinks in a timely manner. Our chef Goeff was awesome too. He was entertaining for all the ages at our table.   If you check in you get free edamame which is what I started with. I ordered the steak and shrimp for the main entree and I was pretty happy with it. I always look forward to the salad though at these restaurants and I was sort of disappointed in that part of it. The rice was so delicious though and the two sauces they serve with the meal were pretty tasty.   We ended up getting lots of things for the happy hour price which was so awesome and made the bill a lot less than we expected! Bonus!!

This was definitely one of the coolest places I've been in scottsdale. There were four of us there on a Saturday night around 7 so of course it took a while to get a table. We went with first available so we didn't get to sit outside on the patio but what a nice space. No wonder it was crowded! While we waited which was only like 45 minutes I had a drink called Mind The Gap. It was so good I asked them for the recipe on Twitter so I could make it myself. It's a mix of cucumber vodka and cardamom and Serrano simple syrup. It's delightful.  For dinner we started with the devil eggs which were so good. The smaller size comes with three which was perfect. We also shared a pitcher of white sangria which is an absolute must. The come mix it at the table and pour it into everyone's glass and add fruit to your glass too so it doesn't spill everywhere. One of my friends and I both got burgers which were so good. I had the green chili one with a lettuce wrap. It was really flavorful. It's served with fresh cut fries which were really good. I'm a lover of French fries!   The service was also really really good which can make a good restaurant really over the top. Not to mention the free chocolate chip cookies you can grab on your way out.   Cannot wait to go back!!

Drinks were so good!! Sat outside on the patio. Open seating on the patio outside and it was really pleasant. We loved the whiskey sour mash, Bloody Mary, and Bellini. Service was great also, Jael was really attentive!! Awesome Sunday drink spot!!

Went here yesterday, Saturday night about 9 pm. We were seated almost right away and the rest of my table had their drinks before I even made it back from washing my hands. I ordered a carafe of one of the unfiltered sakes. It was so good and served in a cute little glass and jar.   One if my friends ordered a roll wrapped in cucumber and said it was one of the best he'd ever had. My other friend ordered the yellowtail roll and commented that it was the most flavorful yellowtail he'd ordered in quite some time. One of my girlfriends and I ordered the house salad which was huge but only five dollars!!! I also got the fried rice which isn't on the menu but I asked  and they said the would make it special.  So delicious.  Overall, wonderful service, delicious food, good drinks, and at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend.

Party of 3 on a Sunday. No wait for an excellent seat on the patio. Started with a couple of local beers and iced tea. Meat and cheese tray for an app that we finished in about five minutes. Delicious!!! Also had the zucchini chips that were just ok. One of us had brick oven pizza that was phenom.  My other friend ordered a sandwich that she enjoyed and I hAd a salad. It was a delightful Sunday afternoon. Overall good service would definitely return.

Awesome!! Worth the wait for a table. Soft pretzels with cheese and mustard were excellent. We also shared a club sandwich and fries which we really liked a lot. Service was prompt, coffee was delicious, and so were the bloody Mary's. Have been there twice already and would certainly recommend it.

I have to be honest that I really would prefer to go to the Home Depot down the road. The customer service at Home Depot is really really good especially because I'm not always sure exactly what I need. I also think they have a little bit better selection.

Everyone is so dang nice here I love it! What a great start to the morning! I always order iced or hot americanos which they call their regular coffee. So if you don't like espresso watch out!! They also have coconut milk, but not almond milk. The service is super fast, they can get a lot of people through the drive thru in a hurry. Such a nice alternative to Starbucks!!

So I'm from Kentucky and jus let me tell you bein in this place totally made me feel like I was back home. And I loved it!! I had a few things a la carte cuz I wanted I try everything! To drink I got an Arnold Palmer with unsweet tea (don't tell anyone in ky I did that) and one of my friends ordered the kool aid. It tasted just like a watermelon jolly rancher she loved it!!   Because they cook all the chicken to order it takes a good amount of time to get your food. We were also there on a Sunday after church so there was a pretty long wait. Jus don't expect to be in a hurry is all. One thing I will say was a downfall though was how darn hot it was in there. It was almost uncomfortably hot. They are moving to a new location soon though so hopefully that will fix it!!  To eat I had the fried okra, a thigh, a waffle, and Mac an cheese. I also tried bites of cornbread and red velvet cake. My favorite part was probably the waffle and a close second the okra. Everything was super hot and delicious. I can't wait to go back and try everything I didn't get to try this time!!

I really had high hopes about this restaurant but we were honestly super disappointed. I started with a bacon Bloody Mary and it really missed the mark. We also ordered the pretzel bites and the crunchy shrimp Caesar salad. I get those three things pretty much everywhere I go and I'm really just not feelin dropouts version at all. The best thing I ordered though was the shandy with strawberries and shock top. It was so delicious. Sam was our server and she was wonderful. Nice atmosphere might go there again for drinks.

First, you can't beat the atmosphere or the bakers rack full of pastries at this breakfast spot. I love to come here not only for the chocolate croissants but because they actually have breakfast meals that don't include eggs. I don't like eggs and it's actually really hard to find something substantial on a menu without them. I always get he wild mushroom tart and it is soooo good! And filling. It is served with a side of fruit and also strawberry scones. You will absolutely be full after all of that, but a little pastry to start off with never hurt anyone. The coffee they serve here is also really good. I'm not sure what kind it is but its yummy.   Good place to bring out of town guests. Everyone loves it. My friend brought her mom the first day of the vacation and she insisted on going back every day after for the duration of the trip!   Both outside and inside tables are a nice place to be.

This is my favorite bar in Scottsdale, far and away. We go here at least twice a month and love their drinks! I love their Titos Tea which I don't think they have on the menu anymore, but you gotta ask for it!   My favorite thing to order is the meat and cheese boards which is so delicious, but the presentation is really the best part. It's always different and has tons of cheese and bread and fruit and smears of fruit! Yummy!!   My friends and I really love the atmosphere at Kelly's and always have a great time when we go there. It's a nice place because it's more chill than the rest of the places in scottsdale so you can go out and have fun without the club atmosphere.

After a walk to old town, we decided (based on the crowd) that morning squeeze had it goin on. The wait was only about 15 mins, and we got to sit on the open air patio in the beautiful AZ weather.  We actually got a table quicker by asking for a table outside. We started off with a classic bloody, and it was good. We also got an iced mango chai tea which was the winner of the day. Briana was really good, but the food took a long while to come out (not her fault). The presentation of the dishes was completely lacking. One soup of the day (clam chowder) and half BLT, and it tasted okay. The Crab Bennie was also ordered with country potatoes and it was also just okay. Nothing spectacular here. However, the biscuits and gravy were awful. There is a distinct taste to them, that may be for some,  but we could not even eat one half of a biscuit (and we LOVE biscuits and gravy). Briana was nice enough to take it off the bill for us. Overall, not worth the 40 dollars plus tip to eat breakfast for 2... Would consider ordering some different dishes, as we unfortunately struck out on all 3. Would also say, the atmosphere is great for brunch drinks!

We had the shrimp and chips and fish and chips and really loved it. The French fries are really thin and hot and crunchy and were so good. I also loved the coleslaw but it's not finely chopped so that could throw you off if that's your preference. The cocktail sauce was also spicy and delicious. Service was awesome and the guys came over to the table to refill drinks and bring more sauce which was nice even though it's sort of a self service place. Total bill for the three meals and a bottle of wine was about $56.00.

Live music and open mic night Wednesday night and happy hour from 4-7 pm everyday.   Bells beers (the best beer) on tap! Oberon in a can! Best day ever!!   For breakfast I love the cinnamon coffee cake and coffees. They also have almond milk which is always a plus. Live music on Saturday also!!

The atmosphere was super relaxed and cool and had a good mixed crowd. I got the plain and simple burger and it was really tasty. I'm not usually a huge fan of buns but this one was pretty good!   There were three of us so we ordered two baskets of fries to share. Fries are like my favorite thing and these were delicious! We got the regular ones and the Parmesan. The best thing ever is that they will bring the fries out ahead of time if you want while you're waiting on the burgers!
