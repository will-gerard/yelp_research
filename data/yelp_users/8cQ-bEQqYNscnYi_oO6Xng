This place is hands down the best pho I've ever had. If you know of a better place please let me know....Great flavor and price, can't beat it. The place is a little dirty but that's the way a pho place is suppose to be.

BEST PIZZA IN OLD TOWN Bar District!  Been coming here since the original owner Lori owed. I was initially sad to hear she was moving back to NYC and was curious what was gonna happen to the place.   The new owner's are amazing. They took my constructive criticism and made adjustments accordingly to get the pizza exactly how it was before! If you like a crispy bottom this is the place to go. None of the soggy bottom toppings falling off on first bite etc. Don't be fooled by Gus' Pizza down the way. This isn't a chain which in my opinion makes it better on its own. There's a line for a reason.... IT'S WORTH THE WAIT!

Love this finding places like this! I've been coming to see Mary and Gordon for quite sometime now and am I glad I found them. Food is amazingly fresh and made with love. There isn't one thing on the menu I haven't tried. If you're a first timer i'd suggest one of the daily specials but whatever you're in the mood for you won't be disappointed I promise. Don't forget about the sides too! The pasta salad is a must try item.

When I venture out to eat trying new places is always a gamble to me. Luckly I've had the luck on my side  I was in search of a place near me for some corned beef hash other then my norm. I stumbled across this place and I am glad I did. I of cource ordered their corned beef and it was most definitely a treat!  Unlike most places, they serve theirs in big meat chunks. It was completly unexpected to me. Typically you think of corned beef hash of a mush kinda like what you'd get at US Egg or something. The meat had so much flavor and was extremely tender. After finishing what was on my plate I wanted more!  The portion wasn't too big for the kind of appitate that I have. I'd still have to say that orange table wins the corn beef challenge in my opinion.

Breakfast buzz! Pretty much all I should have to say lol. Nothing on the menu here is bad. Amazing breakfast sandwiches and great lunch salads. Haven't had one bad thing ever. Recommendations from me are obviously the buzz, (I get mine with almond milk which makes it a little more sweet), California club breakfast sandwich, croissant breakfast sandwich, man salad and Portobello soup, but like I mentioned before you can't really go wrong with anything you order.  If I had to give a tip, I'd say if you haven't been here before you should try to park and go in so you don't back up the already long drive through line. Unless you scope out the menu ahead of time so you're ready to order.

Never a dull moment eating here. The Filet/ Wagyu wrapped asparagus is a must try, served on a hot rock table side where the sauce is poured at the table presenting a cool little show. Some of my other favorites are the Hamachi green chillies and just simply a chef's selection sashimi plate.

Went to this place anticipating in getting traditional vietnamese rice dish What I found instead was really bad service and rice dishes that are made better at pho resturants. The small cups of water they give you serve no purpose. One sip and it's empty. I had to sit though almost an entire meal with no drink. Everytime I attempted to call a server over, it was almost like they ignored me. I don't know if i'll be going back to this place

Ok so after giving this place a big break i have made it back and WOW, they must of read my review cause some serious changes were made! Service was excellent and the awkward water cups that i experienced before were gone away with.   This time i went in wanting a rice dish but ended up getting a noodle dish. It was super flavorful! House Soup is what it is call but you order it "Dry" ya i know kinda weird but its super good, definitely worth trying!

This place is amazing! First time I experienced it I was at a good friend of mine house, (who lives above the restaurant), that had them cater a custom meal for a little friendly gathering he had. Food was absolutely unforgettable. Gravy so good you could drink it! Literally!!  Any Who found out that every Tuesdays they do a ramen only night so I had to try it. My first experience there was absolutely amazing. The menu is very simple only letting you choose from 4 different broths and now 2 appetizers. Let's just say that after the first experience I've gone back every single Tuesday for the past month/ 1.5 months! Haven't missed one Tuesday. Every time I've gone I try to introduce friends to experience it and they immediately get hook too. So now I have a group of about 4-5 people that go EVERY tues! I've had every broth and they're all good you can't go wrong. Tonight I even got one to go.   Been meaning to go in on a regular night but haven't had the pleasure. Looking forward to it and will write a review about it at that time, till then happy eating..........

Tried calling in my order as I normally do and can't get anyone to answer the phone. Last Tuesday took me 6 attempts till someone finally answered. When I arrived I expected it to be packed since the weather is cooling down. Walked into a ghost town and my order ended up being wrong. Super disappointed and sad that Jessica is gone.

If you haven't been you MUST try! This place never fails on anything from the service, atmosphere and of course the food!   Everything on the menu is great so hard to give an actual recommendation. If I had to choose would be a seasonal item which is Burger... yes a burger. Duck burger that is! Your welcome in advance. Another must try which is great for sharing is the signature salad. Im not a salad person so very rare that i'd recommend to try it.. Its that good!   Be sure to also indulge in there amazing hand crafted cocktails as well. Happy Eating!!!

Best experience ever! Very professional, very very fast response and repair. I was expecting to have to drop off my phone and pick it up another day but that wasn't the case. They offered to stay a little late to accommodate my work schedule since it was a simpler repair. They said it would take about an or so and even offered a loaner phone. They got it done in 45 mins and charged me less than what they had quoted me. If you have something apple that needs repaired these are the people to see. The tech use to even work at the apple repair facility. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING!!!!

Pretty sure this place is closed down because I've tried calling and the phone number doesn't work and I've tried going to the place about three different times now during their business hours and there's no one there. they have no signposted saying they're closed down moving or moved 4/9/2015

I like to consider this place a little diamond in the ruff. Came to this place cause it was highly recommended to me by a chef friend, (Gloor (-;), and so glad I decided to give it a shot! I've been here a few times now and haven't had one bad thing off the menu. They have these giant tots that are stuff with different things everyday. It's a place you can tell the chef is passionate about his food and it clearly shows through the food. Ingredients are fresh and cooked to perfection. Currently on a mission to try everything on the menu. You will not be disappointed in this place. Great vibe and great music.

Very cool place. I've driven by this place many times and have also eaten at place next door, (Yacht House), finally a friend brought me here for their "burger weds" and man was I happy he did.   So every Weds on top of their already amazing burgers they offer a special which is usually the one i'd suggest to get. Explosion of unique flavors such as Sriracha candied pancetta and something they call "food crack sauce" I've only been here twice and will most def be back.   P.S. they have burgers available any night and many beer pairing to go along with the already good food.

Slowest place ever. waited over an hour for appetizers. My buddy went to loco patron next door and got tacos before the apps came out. He showed up about 30 mins after we got here too. First app that showed up was an app we put it after the complete order was place. Their excuse was that its a very easy app to make. He then went and got another set of tacos before the entrees came out. Finished eating the second set of tacos and "fast app" still isn't out. Entrees came out at room temp not even hot as if it was fresh off the grill ect. Very very very disappointed if I could give no stars I would give no stars. Still sitting here waiting for the app to come out that's suppose to be a "fast app" ridiculous!!!!!

Quick safe spot. Come here quite it bit for Pickup/ togo orders. Their Ramen is pretty good when feeling down. Haven't had anything i was disappointed with by this place. Its very reasonable pricing. For a good deal on sushi can't complain. Worth giving a shot for sure

Haven't found too many butcher style BBQ places here and was skeptical, (which i normally am now of any bbq place after having little miss), but this place didn't disappoint.   Allowing you to sample anything on the menu before ordering was huge plus. I had the prime rib along with a non spicy sausage and some shredded brisket. All was pretty good most definitely better than any Lucille's or Famous Dave's etc. This is good BBQ!

Another place with amazing food created by Chef Aaron May. If you're need you fix for some lobster, this is the place to go! Some of the must tries in my opinion are the following: Clam dip, Clam chowder & Lobster rolls (both). Can wait to get back here to explore the rest of the menu!

Came back again to explore more of the menu. This time I made sure to bring my appetite. Started off with the calm dip and again it was amazing as I can remember. Also decided to try the octopus and couldn't pass up the clam chowder. Clam chowder was better than it was last time! I could eat it everyday! Octopus was cooked perfectly and had great flavor    For entree decided to go with cheese burger cause I saw it come out twice and it just looked amazing. I'm so glad that I made that decision! I can't figure out what it is but there's something about it that makes it just unbelievable. Honestly surprised for a place that seems like you should get seafood but Aaron May never disappoints.   Getting ready for the dessert course so will update after

Great place and Chris is amazing. Very helpful and extremely knowledgeable. If you've been debating to get into the hobby and skeptical this is a great place to start. TONS of quality used equipment and they're there to answer any questions you may have. I've been using this place for as long as I can remember and have NEVER been disappointed. Now conveniently located in tempe.   FYI: The door & windows are all blocked off to help with heat so sometimes it looks closed but just walk up to door to check. This place is worth the trip to check out

My friend A. May suggested this place and I'm sure glad he did! Place is simple and i'd have to say the best taco's i've had. Will most def be back to sample the rest of the menu. I wasn't that hungry when i went so just got 3 taco's; Carne, Pastor and their Chiwas special. All three were amazing. The Pastor was my fav.   If you're in the area you gotta check this place out!

As good as it gets when it comes to a men's barber shop. My man Sam has been cutting my hair forever & I've followed him from his previous shop to his own. Place is clean, inviting and easy. If you've been searching for a regular place to go look no further. They do threading, straight razor shaves etc. They're fast, professional and affordable! Stop in and see for yourself. Nothing worse than getting a bad hair cut, you WON'T have to worry about that here.
