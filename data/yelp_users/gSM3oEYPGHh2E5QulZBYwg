It's unfortunate I read some of the reviews below and I can relate to most of them. we had discovered this place years back and realize it was probably the best sushi we have ever had in Arizona. recently the quality has suffered. And the service which used to be amazing has become uncaring and rude 3 mistakes to run up my order they charged my card 3 different times for three different prices. spent the last 20 minutes trying to rectify the situation.  The food I'm pretty sure they don't have any real Japanese chefs making sushi or food in the kitchen considering the teriyaki chicken was more like fajitas worst teriyaki chicken I have ever had in my life. Hands down no joke. I mean who put the saut√©ed bell peppers with teriyaki chicken? The only thing that was missing what's the Tapatio. couldn't make heads or tails of that dish awful. then my daughter had some sort of sushi roll tasteless and disgusting. There's no way a real Japanese sushi chef would have made this. As for the service well the waitress never cleared one dish from our table while we were eating the dishes are way too large for the table it was a cluttered mess she was tipped appropriately.  The fried rice was fine. the yellowtail hama was a bit dry. But all in all whoever is running the place has turned from a place I used to want to get to the minute they opened to avoid the huge crowds to a place that we will from here on forward avoid with sadness. Used to have to wait there would be a line to get in at the sushi bar right when they open.  But now 9 o'clock on a Friday night the place is half empty I hope they read Yelp and I hope they see the changes that made are not for the best. Goodbye Sakana we won't come back.

my wifes company has their Christmas party here at the hotel. They were amazing they dedicated an area in front by the fire pit and brought us some amazing cocktails not entirely happy about their version of A old fashioned. But the experience in the atmosphere was very classy. At dinner service was good we had a huge table of 14 people. Beef barley vegetable soup was very hearty and delicious. The Cornish game hen the way it was prepared was excellent and for dessert I had the lemon meringue tart that was amazing I pretty much ate the whole thing.

I'd give this place 3 stars if I was only reviewing the Bar...but on occasion, I take my family here for dinner...and as usual, we were very disappointed with the food quality and taste.  This is one of the last standing local joints in the Copa, so they know that they do not need to raise the bar on themselves due to a captive audience.  The quality if what leaves the kitchen is un professional and bland.  Boneless BBq wings - my daughter was nauseated while eating these, her normal fav dish.  Chicken Pot Pie - RAW dough at the bottom;  soupy mess in between...Asian Chicken Salad with their special ginger sesame dressing???  This was tasteless and the chicken was in long strips and also without taste.  Lettuce was in 6" strips and a very miss matched sort of greens...  My son ordered the Traditional Wings medium w/ hot on the side...these were as always very tasty.  See, not all bad, but if you want a meal and not bar food, go to KFC.

Servers at the bar are always great, let's just get that out of the way; never had any complaints about their hospitality of professionalism...the food is the problem here;  no matter how you update the dinning room and add something to the menu you need to know what the hell you are doing and what you are serving.  in this day of instant Karma (Yelp etc.) when it is bad enough you have to to sit and write something you know its bad...and i feel that for every bad or mediocre review on Yelp there are 10 people that just didn't want to waste their time...my advice to Native is hire a chef that knows how to prepare wings. or change your name to Native Grill & Beer...I make epic wings at home compared to these professionals...and the salad?  I had the "Skinny Asian Chicken Salad"  dry and i mean D R Y chicken,,,a mess of lettuce and 2 small single rings...yes a single ring not a slice of red onion...odd shaped and weirdly cut lettuce all iceberg which i don't mind but this was an Asian salad...canned mandarins?  canned pineapple?  why bother with that at all? suggestion...add fried won-tons and less mandarins...NO Pineapple...also don't drown the lettuce in that what-ever-it-was dressing...

I'm happy to say that over the last year and a half native has definitely up to their game here locally in Maricopa. Always satisfied with the wink selection now that they have better choices. Sometimes of her sitting at a table in the main part the restaurant the service is not that great actually in general the service is not spectacular but they have a lot of young people who are just learning the business.definitely happy about food especially the wings my son and I enjoy their wings all the time

So my wife and I rode our bikes this morning to the Duke for breakfast. Complete garbage breakfast, worst possible breakfast you can imagine I don't know what happened here, this place  used to have good food and now it is disgusting.  could not eat what they called eggs Benedict, eggs were almost cold and completely under cooked.  Hollandaise was a mess. I had a fruit platter and cottage cheese pretty hard to screw that up.  Been living here for 10 years and always used to be pleased with food at the Duke, but this was awful.

Yes, 5 stars when you compare this place to any other place in the area, or in Phoenix for that matter.  Best customer service I have encountered in Scottsdale, PERIOD. I took an associate there on good Yelp reviews and it was in the area, he too was as impressed with the service, he will be mentioning this visit in his next lecture on RETAIL CUSTOMER SERVICE for the specialty coffee industry.   The Ahi salad I had was excellent, and the sweet potato tots are great!  Looking forward to getting back there for dinner!

Had lunch here today with a business associate - the best Croissant chicken salad sandwich I've had in a long time...and I do make my own...sweet tasting and excellent!  Also had an iced latte  -  double ristretto shot of PRESS espresso (local roaster) ...great job. Loved it and my business associate was pleased as well...he had the Turkey sandwich..."what was that ..."  it was cranberry relish(?) with whipped cream on turkey...You need to try this...All in all a great meal, cafe was quiet enough to have a good conversation and the owner / host James Bernau has the energy and enthusiasm of a 11 year old boy and loves his job!  Great coffee & espresso Great lunch.  If your in the neighborhood, you need to get into Play Grounds Fun-zone Cafe.

Small burritos...large tortillas....this place used we to be okay but now it just seems to have gone downhill... They  only have two choices for salsa then some peppers.  For $9.00 I can get so much more and much better food down the street...cost me 17$ for 2 burritos and 1 Fanta soda.

Best pour over coffee in Arizona.  Cold brew coffee, whole bean sales and home brewing equipment.

Nice space.  Avoid the following.  Oatmeal coffee espresso.  These items are not good.  Worst oatmeal. Coffee is always too dark and over roasted. Even their "smooth and bold" tastes like old coffee shop bottom of the pot.
