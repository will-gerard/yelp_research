I was staying across the street at La Quinta and I needed a rebase and a pedi. Jimmy was nice, fast, gentle and spoke great english. His nail art was fantastic and the place was clean. I cheated on my regular gal in Denver for this location since I haven't been back home in a month. I would definitely cheat on her again when in town. It was even cheaper than my regular gal too.   The pedicure was nice...only $18, however it wasn't as relaxing as my usual and the massage didn't last very long. I didn't catch the lady's name, but she spoke no english. Nice, but I'm a talker. Plus I like to communicate with people with sharp objects touching my feet.  I will be back to see Jimmy...but I will probably just get my rebase and be on my way.

This place pretty much sucked. It took forever and when our tanker cane out it still had soap all over it. It looked bettet when we came in. One gentleman out of tg e 10 that were working tried to make it righr...not a manager. The chrome shop was cool...if we had a Century I could have had anything under the sun, but we drive a Cascadia. Tge ladies inside were very nice and accommodating however, with a Blue Beacon next store...we will never come back to Danny's for a wash.

Such a great store. We were looking for a portable feeding set for our dog in our truck. They only had the large one on t the shelf and we needed a small one. I asked the helpful, friendly sales lady for help and she said they were discontinued, but she remembered seeing one on the sale shelf. Low and behold, there it was..and 30% off. We got to the register and they took an additional 10% off. They have a great selection of Blue Buffalo products and found the deer antlers that my beagle loves. We will definitely be back to this store. Very happy with everything we purchased.

This location is not in the best part of town, however I drive a big truck and there is ample parking at this location. The staff is always so friendly and accomodating and my dog is always free. The pool and hot tub are always spotless and I can get my laundry done as well.   This location serves the best hot breakfast of any La Quinta I have stayed at....Scrambled eggs, bacon and hash browns as well as waffles, cereal, assorted breads and bagels, juice, milk, coffee and yogurt.
