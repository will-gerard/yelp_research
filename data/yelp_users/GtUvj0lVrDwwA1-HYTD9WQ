We loved it when we first moved in. Until the cockroaches came and the office only sent the big guy once. Then they got bought out. The worst mistake. The office manager is incredibly rude. They "supposedly" sent us a certified letter stating a non renewal, but we didn't get anything nor did we sign for amything. They then proceeded to tell us we had r8 hours to get out or they start the eviction process. I have a 2 year old but I was just told me it wasn't their problem.   Don't move here. They seem nice at first but once your in, your beneath them and they act like they are better than you. Very unprofessional.

Sandy and Anthony were amazing, Sandy helped us with our situation. She got us in and was the most friendly human ever! Will definitely be back to this location
