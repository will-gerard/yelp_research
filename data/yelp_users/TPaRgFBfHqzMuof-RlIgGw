I got a western bacon cheese burger, the meat was overcooked, bun soggy, cheese cooked away dry, I think they microwaved this thing, I never learn, not the first time to experience horrible food

Excellent food, I had the pepper steak with wonton soup, brown rice, won ton, egg roll and ice tea, all excellent all for under 10 bucks

Food was great, I did the 3 ribs with meat brisket, bacon cheese fries with beans and sweet tea, the sweet tea is the best I've ever had, with a drink and tip it averaged out to 25 bucks per person, the seasons are reminiscent of Louisiana, the 3 barbecue sauces, sweet, ghost pepper and classic, the meats come seasoned with dry rub, you can add sauce to your taste

Service not so good at this location steak came not really hot, potatoes were okay but not as hot as they should of been, waitress was slow to check on us, the Gilbert location is always right on maybe just a bad night here
