Very Slow service, be prepared to wait for at least 25-30mins for your food.It's a family run business, the husband cooks in the kitchen. The wife is the only waitress. That explains it all.  The price for seafood is awesome , and pretty Authentic Chinese cooking. Warning, this restaurant looks run down, and kinda dirty. Suggest to call and order ahead, or do take out.

This is the 4th time I have been here, everything has been consistently excellent ! Live seafood from the tank ( lobsters, crabs).Their service is attentive and  food is served pretty fast. Of course, thumbs up for authentic Cantonese cooking!  The closest real Chinese place to my house, so I will be coming back whenever  I don't feel like driving to chandler or Mesa.

Best Vietnamese restaurant in north Scottsdale ! I love how flavorful their soup(pho) is. Egg roll and special pho with everything is what I order every time. I choose Saigon Nites over TeaLight Cafe, even though TeaLight Cafe is actually a little closer to my house.  Food is delicious and always comes out consistent. Come and eat pho, you will not be disappointed !

I went to Mastro's last week for the new Sunday Brunch, very good selection on the food. Excellent Service, you can also order their Lobster Bisque and Omelet, Belgium Waffle and the famous butter cake from the kitchen at the brunch!Very good and attentive service, nice ambiance.  It was an awesome dinning experience! I will defiantly come back again!

This is why Koreans should never make sushi... Fish not fresh at all, poor presentation, I would never go back there again.

Here on a Friday night! Just Finished dinner :) quite some people, they only have two servers here tonight so the panchan came out  pretty slow. Ordered sootofu and Bibimpam the portion is a little small, but satiates. Will come here when I don't feel like driving to the east valley.

Yoshi Bento deserves 5 stars! It's a hole in the wall joint. Their menu is pretty simple, consist of sushi rolls , bento combos, and good ramen! I LOVE the spicy pork ramen and the pork / chicken Katsu rice plate. The owner Jay is very friendly, when he is not busy he always drops by and says hi. This is a nice place if you want a quick meal, or call ahead for to go orders!

This place messed up my take out order a few times now. They also " forgot" that I ordered Thai tea for a couple times, I had to remind them... Bad service!!!

The waxing staff Ashlee did an amazing job on my eyebrows and the Brazillian wax. I highly recommend European Wax:)

I came here specifically for the hot pot. I ordered the spicy beef hot pot.. The broth is not very flavorful . Also they are very stingy on the meat. I also ordered a Taiwanese sausage from their BBQ menu. It was awful ! (you know what I'm talking about! )Service was terrible as well, there was only one waitress for the entire time. She didn't even bring the rice and dipping sauce until I'm half way done eating . Will never be back again... I don't understand how restaurant owners put mediocre stuff on the menu and expect people to pay for it. They are totally trying to copy Boiling point but way off .
