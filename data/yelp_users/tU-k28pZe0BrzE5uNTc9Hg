We had breakfast here twice during my recent trip to AZ. It was solid. They have indoor and outdoor seating and service was good. We had ice tea to drink and they were refilled without having to ask.  We ordered..  Lean & Green Omelette- Egg whites, spinach, mushroom, broccoli, onion, bell peppers & Swiss cheese Whole Hog Omelette- Ham, bacon, sausage, chorizo and cheddar cheese drizzled with crème fraiche Quick Start- Conscious 4 egg whites, broccoli, cottage cheese, tomatoes & fresh fruit The Bird Omelette-Turkey, avocado, mushrooms, boursin & topped with crème fraiche  All were tasty, with fresh ingredients.

I wanted to give this place a great review, but... We stopped in the afternoon the day of our arrival in Phoenix and really liked the look and feel of the place. There were chickens in the rotisserie and steaming hot pork roast on the carving block. We had already had a late breakfast so we planned to return another day.  We did. And I ordered the BBQ Platter, with that pork on my mind.  When it arrived the chicken was warm, but the pork was cold! it has warm BBQ sauce on it, but it was cold. They were probably thinking that pouring hot sauce on old, cold pork would heat it enough. It did not. Not smart. If your intent is to pass off old cold pork as fresh, at least heat it up first! Geez. I explained to the waiter that it was cold.  I think they tried to heat it, not sure. It came back slightly warm and super dry.  I was super bummed and disappointed.
