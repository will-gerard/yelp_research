Definitely a cool spot.  We live downtown and were looking for a place to watch Game 1 of the Cavs-Warriors game and stopped in last night.  It was packed.  We were fortunate enough to get a couple barstools as there was some convention in town and it appeared everybody was flocking here.  The bartenders were great.  We never ran dry on drinks and were able to get some good wings on happy hour.  We tried boneless wings and their "Gorilla Wings".  The boneless wings were great but we were not a fan of the Gorilla Wings by any means.  They were tough and not very tasty.  It was almost is if we were eating deer jerky.  But the boneless wings were great.    The vibe in here is what made it fun.  There were a lot of Golden State fans a lot of Cavs fans.  There was a lot of cheering and booing going on but not in a hostile way.  It was  good time.   This will definitely be our go-to for games and drinks.

Diego Pomona (that's me) loves the Hard Rock Cafe's.....at least the one's I've been to!  I do agree with the reviews that say it's overpriced, because it kind of is....but you got to expect it.  It's downtown and it's the Hard Rock......ROCK ON!  The nachos are spectacularly delicious and the burgers are so big that they are hard to finish.  They have a cool drink selection and it's always fun to buy the cup as a souvenir...it also helps justify the price of the cocktails.    I've been here a few times and the waiters/waitresses have always been fun and prompt.  It's definately not as big as some of the HRC's that I've been to but they got some got stuff hanging on the walls if you want to walk around and burn off your nachos while you wait for your burger.   Rock over there!

I'm usually not a huge fan of airports because they are usually always a cluster-F...but something about this one makes going here less stressful.  Getting here is kind of goofy, especially if you are returning a rental car, but once you are here it is pretty easy to get in, get through security, and get to your gate.  There's a nice Starbucks before going through security and some cool Arizona touristy-type shops.  Once through security, which is usually painless, there's some fast food restaurants and a nice Mexican restaurant/bar right by the Delta terminals to help make the ride a little more enjoyable.  Not a bad airport!

Not a huge fan.  Seems all reviews on here are 4-5 stars but don't let that fool you.    What reeled us in was the bait planted outside the door.  The girls outside were smokin' hot (literally, they were smoking....cigarettes!)  The $10 cover was bogus, I expected to see a lot more scenery for that price. The place was crowded, felt a little cramped in there and not much wiggle room.    The drinks were pretty standard priced for the type of club and the girls were extremely hot, but with a $10 cover it was a waste to see painted nipples!    I won't come back here unless I'm wasted or they lower the cover charge.

The layout is a little whacky but it's in a great location and it's a lifesaver!  I remember my first time in Vegas a few years ago waking up with a killer headache and wanting to eat the coffee grounds in the hotel room because I needed a jolt and a migraine cure.  That's when I first found this Starbucks and it was my savior.  Pretty sure I stuck a straw in a Venti and sucked away while I chewed Advil LiquiGels like they were Skittles.  Anyways, I was just back a couple months ago and frequented it again for a few days.  Customer service has always been friendly for as busy as they are.  Nothing bad to say about them!  Make sure you locate this one the night before so you can crawl over there whenever you wake up the next afternoon.

I like this B-DUBS....as everyone seems to call it.    The service was great, the hostess and waitress were friendly and prompt.....and it was even a game night when we went!    The food was good (caribbean jerk boneless wings) and the beer was ICE COLD (Corona, if you were wondering).  I would definately go back.  And, for Scottsdale, it was reasonably priced.  Rock on B-DUB A DUBZ!

I've gotten my haircut here over the years when I've lived in that Happy Valley area.  I've had it cut by Jennifer mostly and Philip a couple years back.  I've never had a problem with this Supercuts.  And, I'm extremely picky about my hair and paranoid of getting bad haircuts.  Prior to coming here, believe it or not, I went to Aveda salons so I was worried about them slaughtering my hair.  But, Jennifer and Philip always have done a great job and have been super friendly.    I'm not trying to discredit some of these reviews because we've all had our own experiences, but I find it really hard to believe that Philip was rude to anyone!  He's always super friendly to me and to everyone that I've seen him come into contact with in there.  I think you might need to give him another try if you had a bad experience because he's got a witty sense of humor from what I remember and I can't imagine he would intentionally be rude to anyone!  Just my .02 on that.

Probably won't stop back here.  For some reason we opted for this location versus Whole Foods, I know, I know, two different beasts.  But, I've been to Fry's before and have always enjoyed them and this was closer to downtown than driving to Whole Foods.    The Pro's: I guess it was cheap, it was closer, that's about it.   The Con's: not a great area by any means, people asking for food/money in the parking lot as we walked in, not very clean, not a good selection of food compared to other locations in my opinion, some lady working there was talking to an invisible person in one of the aisles and then tried asking us something that we couldn't understand, and the baggage took a while and nobody thanked us.  Small things but they added up enough to equal a future no-show.  Will not come back to this location even though it's the closes store to us.

This is a great little Starbucks.  The fact that they have a drive thru alone puts them at the maximum alloted stars.  But, the people that work here have always been friendly.  When I used to live a few blocks away I went here a couple times a day.  I was just back in town for a few days and came here everyday and they are still holding strong with their customer service.  If you live in this part of Glendale, you probably know that not too many places have employees who smile or seem happy but this Starbucks has hired some good people it seems.  Definitely worth the drive if it's a little out of your way.

I used to come here quite a bit when I lived in the area.  Staying nearby, we decided to check it out again for lunch.  Still tastes good!  It's a new spin to an overall boring concept (like Subways).  You get a bag, select from a ton of different sandwiches, and then mark what you want on it and then give them the bag and wait for it to be made fresh.  I used to eat so much Subway that I overall gave up on sandwiches because they bored me but Which Wich is a great alternative.  I had the Beef Cheesesteak yesterday with Cheez Whiz, crispy onion strings, caramelized onions and black olives on it.  It was so filling I swore I'd only eat half of the medium (10") but moments later I was devouring the other half and already knowing I was going to hate myself later.  But, it was worth it.  Definitely worth checking it out if you are wanting a change from the generic boring sub-type places.

For Westgate, this place rocks.    I say "for Westgate" because it's not your typical restaurant/bar fake friendliness place.  They don't serve food, at least the last time I was there, so it's only drinking.  The music rocks as much as rocking can rock in a majority hip-hop Westgate so it's nice to go to Hell's and veer away from the top 10 R&B charts for a while.  The waitresses are all good looking and friendly from my times here.   Sundays nights are the next best thing to an amateur strib club as you can get.  There is a wet t-shirt contest every Sunday night ($5 cover charge) but it's well worth it.  The few times it's been great, of course, there's always one girls owning the pole like she gets paid to do at her strip joint, but overall it's fun and entertaining.    I would recommend it for anyone looking to hear some good music and for those who are tired of drinking at the restaurant/bar scene.  Diego Pomona likes!

This is by far one of my favorite hotels....and I stay in hotels quite frequently it seems.  The Renaissance is a gem in this part of Glendale.  I've stayed here at least seven or eight different times and each time it has been great.  I stayed here last week when I was back in the area checking out jobs and again, it didn't disappoint.  The hotel itself has a lot of perks/amenities/whatever you want to call them.  There's a convention center for business, a nice and fun bar, outdoor seating and a fire pit, a spa, a super nice fitness center with brand new equipment, a lap pool, and outdoor pool, jacuzzi, outdoor bar, and the list goes on.  There's also a parking garage and valet parking for whatever mood you're in.  If you stay here you want to stay in a room with a balcony preferrably overlooking the Westgate area (north) or the pool because I stayed in one that faced the UOP stadium and it wasn't the best scenery.    This is a perfect place to stay if you are in town for a Cardinals game or hockey, or if you are like me and a die hard Parrothead and want to stumble back from Margaritaville in your grass skirt and hula shirt.  (I don't really have a grass skirt).    One of the things that has always been consistent with The Renaissance is the customer service.  Everyone from the front desk, to the bar, to the room service, to the cleaning people....everyone is always very genuine and friendly.  They also have great room service.  Everything from chicken wings, to burgers, to healthy stuff and it's always prompt and not too expensive.    I think you get the point.  Definitely a must-stay if you are in the area.

My friend was visiting me in Phoenix a couple weeks ago and we wanted to get off the beaten path and find something fun to do.  I'm a Jeep lover, don't know where to Jeep around here yet, and also didn't know much about the history of AZ so this tour seemed like the logical adventure.   What sold me right away on this tour was while I was searching for a Jeep tour, we had called a couple other one's and weren't very thrilled with the response as it was right before Christmas.  When I called this place, they were friendly and accommodating from the second they answered the phone.  He asked what worked for our schedules and literally within two hours he was at our apartment and we were in his Jeep and off to the desert.    The tour was great.  We went up north and had a full day.  What we both liked was that our tour guide was super friendly, EXTREMELY informative, and very laid back and answered all of our questions.  There was literally nothing he didn't know about the history of the desert!  We learned about cacti, the wars, Jeeps, surviving in the desert, mining, and the list goes on.  It really felt like we were back in time on a real adventure!  I don't want to give it all away but I highly recommend going on Arizona Territorial Adventures Jeep Tour if you have family/friends in town and want a fun few hours or if you just want to do something different and learn a little bit more about the area.  5-stars all the way around!!

I love Applebees.  Not this one.    Every time I'm hear something gets screwed up.  I'm not kidding.  It's only this Applebees.  On the flip side, the servers are nice and I've gotten to try a lot of renditions of a bbq cheeseburger because it's always differently wrong when I go in.    The restaurant has a nice layout and usually has whatever game on tv that should be on but the service is S-L-O-W and I think they may be doing it so we get so hungry while we nibble on our arms we order more food when they do come around.    Like I said above, I'm a huge Applebee's fan.  Just not this one.

This is a great Yard House.  My first experience at a Yard House was a few years ago at the one in the Scottsdale mall, and well, that was obnoxious.  Not so much the Yard House but the people.  Anyways, moving on...  This Yard House has a great vibe about it.  There's plenty of seating inside but the selling point with this location is the outdoor seating that wraps around the restaurant with plenty of heat lamps.  Being that it's tucked behind Margaritaville, it's a great place to sit and people watch at night.  I had the Mac and Cheese, which is to die for and probably the best adult mac and cheese on the planet, and then I headed inside to the bar for a whiskey.  Of all places in Westgate, the people I ran into here were super friendly and easy to talk to.  The bartenders were really friendly and I ended up staying a couple hours as the patrons at the bar didn't have the attitude as some of the neighboring restaurants and everybody was chatty.  It was a fun experience.  The lighting is a little dimmer inside than some restaurants but it sets the tone for the place and it works.    The Yard House in general has some of the absolute best food around.  If you are in the Westgate area it's a must stop for dinner or drinks.

Not a huge fan of this casino.  Probably the worst casino in terms of "vibe" that I've been to in the area.  It felt dirty to us and probably reeked of smoke worse than any casino that I've ever been to.  The service was hit-or-miss and overall just wasn't a fun feeling by any means.  If Talking Sticks is a "10", this would have the feel of a "1" at best.  Definitely won't go back here anytime soon.

Last night was my first time in 32-years having Papa John's pizza.  I never knew much about them until this season watching the NFL and last night I broke down and had to go pick one up.  I'm glad I did.  I ordered 8 of the buffalo chicken wings and a large pepperoni and black olive pizza....it was good!  I say "delish" but I HATE THAT word...but I just used it...agh!  Anyways, it was great pizza.  The chicken wings were not the greatest I've ever had but they weren't bad.  I would never go their just for the wings but I will definitely go back for pizza.  It was fun waiting for it in the lobby because everyone seemed to be having fun and laughing.  Customer service was great!

I like Danny's!  I used to go here a lot when I lived in Phoenix years ago and stopped back in last week for my first time after moving back a month ago.  Still great customer service and easy.  You can get gas, food, snacks, your windows tinted, oil changes and car washes.  Their car washes are great.  For about $15  you can get it sprayed, ran through the wash, and detailed almost to perfection.  It's a smooth process and my Jeep looked like it was brand new.  This is definitely a must-stop if you need a car wash.  I did have my windows tinted a few years ago at the Happy Valley location and they did an excellent job.

If you would've asked me two weeks ago to rate a 4 Wheel Parts based on my experience in Denver I would've gave them a 1 or a 2 star.  I've never been so annoyed with a company before.  That all changed at this location.    So I bought a brand new Wrangler in Denver with thousands and thousands of accessories on it.  About 75% of them needed rework within the first 100 miles.  I'm not kidding.  It went from the tires, to the wheels, to the lights and so on.    I recently moved back to Phoenix.  Being that 4 Wheel Parts installed all of this stuff in Denver my warranty goes through them and not the dealership.  So, after having a tire issue in Denver and constantly brining it to 4 Wheel Parts to no avail, the shaking and bouncing started about a few days after the Denver store rebalanced them yet again only this time on the way to Phoenix.  So, I called the dealer rep in Denver and he said he'd call the manager of this one in Phoenix and try and get the situation remedied.  I stopped in the morning after Memorial Day and talked to the manager, Glen.  Glen was awesome.  The shop was busy but he got someone right on it.  I explained my situation with him and he said they'd take care of it.  After knowing the hassle that I'd been through and the runaround in Denver, he agreed to replace my tires with whatever I wanted after they determined that it was indeed a tire problem.  Within one day he had them shipped to the store and put on my Jeep.  The Jeep rides perfect now and Glen was awesome to work with.  It was nice to have someone actually go the extra mile and ensure the customer was satisfied before leaving the store.  Basically Glen is the one who saved 4 Wheel Parts reputation for me and in turn I already spend a grand on new wheels just based on his customer service.  If it wasn't for this experience I would've never spent a dime at this company again nor referred anyone to them.  But now, they will definitely be my go-to for Jeep accessories and parts.    Thanks again Glen!

This is honestly the worst Starbucks experience that I've ever encountered.  That being said, I go here almost everyday because it's right by where I live.  Although, I'm starting to go up to the Happy Valley location more now.  For some reason, this Starbucks drive thru is frighteningly slow.  Almost upsetting slow.  I have tried to figure it out but I can't.  A couple times last week whoever takes the orders was trying to be funny and wouldn't just take my order and it was terribly unprofessional and annoying.  Every time I get my coffee drink I swear I won't be back...but I do.  They really need to up their customer service and speed it up a bit.  It's a prime location if they can pull it together.

Let me start out by saying me giving this place 4-stars means it's good....because it's at Westgate and I'm not a huge fan of that scene.  First off, I do think they have a few too many hostesses (never seen a man host), which is fine by me but it's almost a congregation at the entrance.  It's a big bar/restaurant so even on busy days you can usually get a table or a seat at one of the bars.  There's two bars outside which are easily accessible, a lot of tables on the patio that wraps around the front and side of the restaurant, and a couple fire pits that are burning the midnight oil (till 4am on weekends, I do believe).     The food is great.  Get the wings, ribs, or BBQ burger and you won't be disappointed.  Eat at the bar because this place, hands down, has the best looking bartenders at Westgate.  At least the times that I've been here, they have been S-M-O-K-I-N-G HOT!  There's also a bull, which makes this place even better.  For $3 you can sign your life away, the can avoid a lawsuit if you get bucked into the pond, and you can try hold on while they throw you around.  It's fun to watch because you can see a 300 pound man fall off in 4-seconds but a 90-pound woman hold on for a minute....they know what they're doing.  I'd recommend trying it out on the weekdays for lunch if you're going for food, night time if you're going to try and "work your game" or Saturday nights if you're into the whole "TAP OUT and AFFLICTION" scene....which I am definately NOT A FAN OF.  Saturdays can get real annoying if you're not trying to be somebody and don't eat creatine and protein powder for your pre-dinner appetizer.    But, that's not just Saddle Ranch, that's all of Westgate on the weekends so don't hold it against them.  I'd definately check it out if you're in the area.

i stopped in here a couple weeks ago for lunch.  I was seated right away outside in the direct line of the sun (I came from MN).  I loved it.  I had a chicken caesar salad and a water, not too adventurous or daring but it was great.  It's hard to mess up a caesar salad but it's also hard to make a memorable one.  This one was great!  Everyone working here was friendly, prompt, and had a smile.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.  I'd like to check it out at night and throw a couple back.  Great location!

Great casino.  This is a casino you'd imagine in a Las Vegas setting.  Definitely the best casino that I've been to in the Phoenix-area hands down.  Great bars, awesome cigar lounge, fun vibe.  The games are fun, they have Casino War, and the slots don't seem as tight as other casinos in the area.  It seems they must have a great pool as this last weekend we were there and there seemed to be quite a pool/party vibe coming in and out.  The service has always been friendly and overall it's a great hang out spot.

My first experience with this place was during the first week of June.  I went there with a friend of mine for a quick afternoon drink.  The service was terrible, the bartender was about as friendly as rabid pitbull, and the drink was overpriced and stale.  We literally were two of maybe five people in there at the time.    My second experience was on a Saturday night at the end of July.  I was literally as excited about standing in the 25-minute line as I am about turning 50 in a couple decades and staring down the barrel of a colonoscopy.  I could not put in to words what I thought about the clientele of this place.  Wannabe gang-bangers seemed to be the main clientele followed by guys in glittery shirts and fake diamond laced pants.    I was in this place for about 45 minutes.  I have to admit, the music was good and the drink service was above average for the whole Westgate scene.  But, after seeing testosterone filled thugs trying to fight with everyone seemingly just trying to have a good time and being pushed by some guys on the dance floor, it was time to leave.    I haven't been back since and don't intend to.  The place seems to attract drama and, unless this is an afternoon on NBC, I don't need that place in the Days of My Lives!

Everytime I go to this In-N-Out burger, I start becoming religious and just pray that I get back out to my car before I get rat-a-tat-tatted up!  The food is mediocre.  The burgers are good but of all places that I've ever ate French Fries at, this place makes the worst.  The only good thing is the menu is small so you can make your decision quickly with one eye on the menu and the other eye watching your 6 (that means behind you...if you didn't know)  The first time I dined in the joint, a family was arguing about fries versus no fries to the point of them almost having a food fight without food.  The second time, a lady was flipping out and I thought we were all going to get rolled up on.  I think my frustrations with this one is just the location.    On the flip side of this, the employees have always been more than friendly and very professional.    In-N-Out burgers are good, but I'd strongly recommend hitting up a different one.

Stopped in last week and got to see Craig Robinson.  Wasn't quite sure what to expect as I've never been to a comedy club before and I was a little weary of the ticket price and that fact that these shows are a two drink minimum per person.    But, it was definitely worth it.  We had one of the best servers that I have ever had while out and about.  She was prompt, super friendly and very engaging to her tables form the looks of it.  We were able to order a bottle of wine and that was doable for the two of us and our two drink minimum.  We also ordered some sort of appetizer I just can't recall what it was...but it was great.  I think it was something with chicken and Sriracha maybe??    The one thing that I didn't like was how close the tables were and how you basically sit shoulder-to-shoulder with complete strangers.  I guess it's fine if you are drinking and just watching the show but trying to eat and sit that close is uncomfortable.    Overall the show was hilarious.  The opening guy and then the guy that opened for Craig were hilarious.  I will definitely go back.

Being a die hard Parrothead and coming to Vegas for the sole reason of staying and drinking/gambling at the Flamingo and Margaritaville, it was awesome to see the new Margaritaville Casino addition past the restaurant.  Of course, for suckers like me who's blood flows like hot Volcano Nacho lava, I was assured I was going to win at the Margaritaville Casino because of all the Margaritaville/Buffett references and memorabilia.  So, I threw down $20 on the roulette table and won about $130 and I was convinced that Jimmy Buffett is indeed a holy man.  You'd have to be a parrothead to believe that so don't ask.  But anyways, I lost it all right away again and decided to sit at the outside bar attached to the casino and drink the "Who's To Blame" margaritas and just watch other people gamble and walk down the strip.  Anyways, awesome little addition to Margaritaville Las Vegas.

Great sandwich shop!  Living next door and not wanting to walk a block to Subway, we decided to give it a whirl.  Wasn't quite too sure at first after Googling their menu and not seeing a huge selection but we were wrong.  They have a good selection of more basic-type subs but they are delicious.  I had the meatball with onions and Italian seasoning and it was great.  They toast them all and it was nice to not have such a huge mass of crunchy bread like you get at a Subway.  It felt healthier for some reason and fresher.  They also sell fresh baked cookies, brownies and shakes and malts.    Definitely a nice change from the average sandwich shops and will definitely go back.

This place was very much needed in this part of Glendale to save the area and bring some more people back after the fizzle of hype that has been drained from Westgate. I was surprised when I rolled back into town and saw the outlet mall as I previously lived at Westgate and remember nothing but the huge parking lot.  Nice stores, good prices, but lacking a food court.  Your basic outlet stores (CK, NIKE, jewelry stores, etc) so nothing too special but decent prices.  I bought four CK shirts for the price of when one would've costed originally.  Hopefully it continues to bring people back to Westgate and bring some business back!

I was impressed with Enterprise last week.  I always dread the airport and renting cars because in my experiences, they have always been a "Charlie Foxtrot".  Anyways, I took the shuttle form the airport over expecting a mess but it was simple.  I paid upstairs and headed down the escalator for the simplest car rental in history.  I handed my paperwork to the guy, another guy took me to the available cars, and BAM I was in a...wait for it..wait for it....a FIAT!  They are so hideously ugly that I knew being in another state was my only way to pull it off without tinted windows and shame.  The one annoyance that I think Enterprise should clarify is the semi-con job on auto insurance.  My insurance, and most peoples, covers rental cars.  I got all set to go and then this question of if I want whole coverage or liability and then handed a pen.  After he made it sound almost like a necessity he stated that it was merely an option.  Obviously part of his job to upsell but I hope they are ethical with it and explain it to families and senior citizens without making them feel that it's obligatory to but insurance, because it's not if you have it.    Bringing the car back was simple.  A guy met me at the car, looked it over, printed off a receipt and made sure everything was correct.  Overall friendly service and hassle free.  Oh, and the FIAT was actually sort of fun in a slow sort of way.

Probably one of the nicest, if not THE nicest Whole Foods that I've been to.  I've been to several of these and also Fresh Market's from here to Florida and by far this is the nicest layout and selection that I've seen.  You walk right into a juice bar where they will make it fresh for you and a great deli.  The selection is amazing and they have any type of organic food and then some that you will find anywhere else.    Definitely will be the go-to store.

This place was great.  For me, I've never seen the whole draw to Old Town Scottsale unless you are a senior citizen and needing to buy some crafts and lawn decorations for your backyard.  That or boots and a cowboy hat from the onslaught of craftish type stores out here.    Anyways, stopped in here for lunch and a cocktail a couple days ago and it was great.  Had a glass of "Josh" cabernet (because that's my name and I thought it'd be stellar) and a pulled pork sandwich.  The wine was good but the sandwich was great.  It was fresh tasting pulled pork with coleslaw on top with a side caesar salad.  The food was fresh and tasted great and the service was awesome.  Will definitely be back.

I could be a Whale in this Blind Tiger.  Oh yeah.  Give me some more of that stiff Giggle Water (Old Fashioned, please).  Game.On.  We moved in across the street and had heard about this place through word-of-mouth and thought we'd give it a try.  We have lived all over the country and been to some really cool bars and even SpeakEasy types that didn't really pack the gear to serve in the beloved Corps.  (You won't get that unless you've seen Full Metal Jacket or are a Marine).  Bitter and Twisted made me feel like a Big Cheese.   My girlfriend bought me this fedora hat years ago and it still has the tag on it. It's black with a feather.  I've always wanted to save it for something but after a couple hours in Bitter and Twisted all I wanted to do was put it on and smoke a fat cigar.  This place was certifiably awesome.  Bartenders were great.  It'd be hard for me now to go to any of these chain places that make "craft cocktails" after going here.  I tell you their brains must soak in a lot of knowledge to be able to pour it out in these drinks.  They literally are made to a perfection.  I ordered an Old Fashioned, my favorite drink but seemingly elusive at most places, and they did it right.  The only thing that would've been cooler while sipping this beauty would've been drinking it in the back of an old Mercury Eight with with a fat cigar and a Roaring Twenties hottie, although I was with my GF so that counts.   We will definitely be regulars here.  I'd much rather go here and pay for a solid drink than chance it at some of these other places that make drinks according to which way the wind is blowing and gamble at the speed of who can do their count slower.    This place is the Big Cheese of the Phoenix bars.

I teetered between a 3-4 on this one due to the fact that the first time we stopped in the girl seemed really annoyed that we came in a HALF HOUR before close!  Everything was already shut and wrapped and we could tell it really bothered her that there was actually a customer in there that close to closing.  It was 30 minutes before closing!  She wasn't too friendly.    BUT...  We've been here two more times and it's been great.  The last guy that made our sandwiches was awesome.  To be honest it was probably one of the best Subway sandwiches I've ever had.  This was about ten minutes before closing and he displayed customer service at it's finest.  Overall a solid Subway.  Kind of annoying that they and most other food places close so early but it is what it is.

I lived here during this last year and it was by far the best experience renting that I have ever had. I've lived from ND-FL-CO and now California and none of my experiences could top how I was treated at Cityscape. Jazmin and Travis are amazing and are always friendly and prompt with anything you need. Never once was I disappointed. If my complex here in San Diego was half as smooth as my experience at Cityscape I'd feel like I won the lottery. Cityscape is truly service to model. I'd like to send about 99% of the leasing agents and property management companies I've dealt with to a customer service boot camp and have Travis and Jazmin be the drill instructors! I can't say enough about their service and follow through.   The building itself is gorgeous. Awesome pool, great fitness center and awesome concierge service. The gentlemen down at the front treat you as if you were royalty. You also get full access and discounts at the Hotel Palomar and the parking is also safe and secure. Overall a gem in Phoenix.

So I swore off Hardee's and Carls Jr. back in 1993 after I got a job there taking orders.  Now that that's a few decades behind me and I live across the street, I figured I'd give it another whirl.    It was great.  I'm out of the loop on the whole fast food phenomenon in the country but for some reason the quality tasted way better than that of a McDonald's.  Not sure if they use actually real food here but it sure tasted like it.  I had the Western burger and onion rings and it was marvelous.  I went the next morning and got a pass for Eos Fitness because that's how full I felt after eating it but I guess that's the point of eating is to get full....right?    The one thing that was confusing, unless they were messing with me, was that it was like the fries you could get large but only a medium onion ring...or vice versa....it seemed confusing :)  Definitely a go-to in a pinch.

This is a fun spot.  I live downtown and I kept hearing people talk about the 'bar in the alley' so I was bored and walked over there a couple weeks ago.  I"m glad I did.  It's not as confusing as some say.  The easiest way to find it is walk across the street from Seamus and you'll see a door guy sitting outside on a chair.  Not sure how people complicated the simplicity of finding it so much!  Anyways, you'll get your ID checked at the door and down you go.  Follow the steps down and hang a left.  It's a neat old feeling in here.  It almost feels like an old speak easy.  It's very dimly lit with the tables and bar illuminated by candles.  It has a real unique vibe.  Nice open seating area with little two-person booths that surround some high top tables leading up to the bar.  On the right hand side of the bar there are some more booths where you can play games or just keep heading back to the game room.  They have shuffleboard, pool tables and a few other games.  I personally wouldn't go here just for the games because it might disappoint you tad but it's a nice perk for when the booze kicks in.  The one thing that separates this bar from many others similar bars in the area is the friendliness of the staff, from the door guys to the bartenders.  Everyone is friendly and you don't find much attitude down there.  It's also a perk that the couple times I've been here lately they have oldies playing.  Definitely fits the vibe.
