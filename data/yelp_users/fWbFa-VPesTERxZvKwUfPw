Bought a pair of pants about 3 weeks ago, they've sat unworn in the bag since then and I ultimately decided I wasn't that into them and attempted to return them. Well well well I was in for a surprise when I was told they don't do returns. At all. See right there? On your receipt? The piece of paper you get AFTER you've already bought something? Says you can't.   Sorry,  not sorry.   Yes, if you buy from their online store you can.  But not here. Save yourself the headache and buy BCBG from any of the at least 4 other stores (Neiman, Saks, Dillards, Nordstrom, possibly even more) in the mall that sell their exact same product.

I really can't say enough good things about Gentle Hands Dentistry! I went there for my Invisalign treatment and teeth cleaning. The staff is friendly, knowledgable, and willing to answer questions. Plus, they have a Nintendo 64 console in the waiting area I would have died for as a child!

This place is amazing! Got a flyer on our door and decided to check it out. Friendly staff and great food. Fish is the freshest sushi I've had in AZ. Can't wait until they get their liquor license so we can add it to our HH rotation. Best sushi in the area.
