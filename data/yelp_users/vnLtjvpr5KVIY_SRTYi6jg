Best ice cream place in town!!! Their Vietnamese coffee and butter pecan ice cream are rich and smooth!  I'm not an ice cream eater but this place makes me one!

I was super excited they put in a US Egg in North Scottsdale until I experienced the awful customer service and management.   We saw our server once, who never checked to see if we got our food.  45 minutes after we ordered we finally asked for a manager, who was extremely rude and condescending.  From that point forward the server and manager made the situation extremely uncomfortable.  I will never come back to this place which is unfortunate because the other locations are so awesome.
