The food is great and you can't beat the price!  The service was out of this world.  If you are looking for medeteranian food this is the place to go!  Don't bother with the big box stores it's not the same as a restaurant in the back of a grocery store.

Fabian is a great guy and very friendly.  The work he does is top notch! I  had a pair of boots that are 15 yrs old that he did great work on.  I  also had a pair of new shoes I needed arcej support for, he was able to help me within 5 minutes where other shops did not help at all.

I requested a quote from this shop and received an email that I would get the quote within 24 hours, instead it came 72 hours later.  All the quote had was the price of the tire, which was way overpriced; there was no install cost or any other information.  When I called to clarify exactly what the cost would be out the door, the guy I spoke to was curt and rude.  -  If this is how they treat a potential sale, I do not wish to find out how poorly they treat their customers.

Everything is locally grown and super fresh and you can taste the difference!!  These are the best burgers I've had (other than home made).  The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  The only catch is... don't go if you're in a hurry.  It is pretty much a local treasure, and the lines show it. - If it's your birthday make sure to let them know.

Surprised at so many great reviews.  The restaurant  was clean, the workers were friendly, and the food was fresh... unfortunately  the steak shwarma pita was dissapointing.  The flavor, saltiness, and toughness of the meat specifically is what was so dissapointing.

Eric does a great job, pricing is fair (if not better than fair), and he is very upfront with what is needed and what the cost will be. He knows Audi's and knew exactly what to look for when I told him the issue. -- I am very particular about who I take my car to and I won't hesitate to bring my car back here.  I highly recomend Tunning Gruppe!

The good.  The wait time was short and the facility was clean... and that is the long list of what was good.  The staff was almost rude, forgot a couple items that had to be taken care by the PA, and I  had to finish the paperwork that was incomplete.  The PA was Trent Blake.  His demeanor was sort of friendly, but his execution was lacking.  He had no concern for anything that might cause me pain.  During my physical he thought he found a hernia in my groin, what he found was a malformation from birth.  Instead of moving on he continued to "diagnos" forcefully; which caused me weeks of excruciating pain. - Normally I would have stopped the exam and just gone somewhere else, but I had to have the physical completed that day.  My recomendation. Stay away from this place.

Great service, really good food, and farm fresh.  The burgers are really good, definitely worth more than one visit... and that it is farm fresh makes a huge difference.

Dissapointing.  The brushes were to harsh, and put to much pressure on the car.  The chemicals are also harsh and leave the paint striped of any protection.  I  do not recommend this car wash.

The food is great and the service is outstanding, and for the price it is a tremendous deal.  - If you haven't tried it the "Full" is probably one of if not the best item on the menu.
