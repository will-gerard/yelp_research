Booked an appointment at Northlight Counseling a month ago, had my husband take the kids to preschool, arranged to be late to work, and navigated crazy Phoenix traffic for 60 minutes during rush hour only to have them tell me they made a mistake and didn't have me on their schedule. Now they can't get me in for another month! Ugh! I don't think I will be going back. They did apologize, but I will not risk having this happen again.  It's too bad because I had heard good things about Dr. Hicks.

We attended the Migration Celebration and had fun learning about butterflies, bats, and birds through hands-on, interactive displays and presentations. Everyone was so friendly here and we especially enjoyed wandering the trails! Great for families!

Fall in love with fondue at the Melting Pot! The cheese fondue and the dessert fondue are my favorites, but the entrees aren't shabby either! Come hungry and expect to stay several hours. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars is for the price. We are teachers and about go broke dining here, but once in awhile we need to give ourselves a treat and splurge! Atmosphere is great for special occasions.   Cheese fondue favorite = Swiss Dessert fondue favorite = yin/yang (while & dark chocolate)

We had a very pleasant 1st experience at Jungle Roots! My 3-year-old was not at all afraid to be at the dentist's office. She enjoyed playing in the jungle themed waiting room and was able to wear sunglasses and hold a stuffed animal during the exam. Dr. Culp was gentle and made sure to answer all our questions. After the exam they gave both my daughter and my son (who wasn't seen) a token for a prize and a choice of toothbrush. I think my kids will be eager to go back!

I have frequented this library with my children for the past six years. When they were babies, we enjoyed the babytime program. Now that they are preschool age, they are not allowed into the younger programs and their preschool program falls on a day I work, so we do not go as often. Most of the staff has been friendly, but today I had a very unpleasant encounter with a woman in the area where they sell discarded books. I don't have her name, but she was a much older woman wearing a white shirt. She was quite rude and gave me a lecture because she didn't think I was going to pay for the books in my arms. On the contrary, we donate and give money to this library on a regular basis. Unfortunately, this one encounter makes me not want to do so anymore.

This is the worst care I have received. I was very sick and losing weight rapidly and I saw Michelle Barnett, NP for two appointments. She prescribed me several prescriptions without refills. Additionally I saw the other NP for an appointment that was a complete waste of my time as she was not able to help my situation at all. When I ran low on my prescription my pharmacy sent a refill request. It was not honored. I called Ahwatukee Primary Care and they informed me they do not refill prescriptions with a refill request fax and I would need to come in to see another doctor because Michelle Barnett left the practice. I am very sick without my prescription, but they did not bother to tell me she had left and my prescription remains un-filled. They were not compassionate about me being out of my medication. They didn't have any appointments that work for me (they close early and I do not have childcare), so I am going to another doctor at another practice close by that was able to get me in at an appointment that worked today. I will not return to this practice.

Date night at Ground Control was a blast and we had great service! My husband and I went here on a Saturday night. It was nice to have live music. Our server was friendly and attentive. We tried the wine tasting (lots of wine for the price!), bread with dipping, ham & brie panini & mahi panini with side salads, thai iced tea, and hazelnut gelato to top it all off! My husband also bought a bag of coffee beans on the way out the door. Everything was great. Unfortunately, it is pretty far from our house, but we would like to come back sometime, possibly with our kids.

One of our favorite places around south mountain! The food is pricey, but the sandwiches are big and my husband and I often share one. There are also free refills on the passion iced tea. We take a blanket, ball, and pack food for the kids. We also like to walk around to see the chickens and artist's studio. My young son enjoys collecting the pecans.  It feels like you are no longer in Phoenix and makes for a nice outing!

We went to the AZ Natural History Museum around the corner and needed a spot for lunch. We had no clue what to try in downtown Mesa, so we popped into de la Cruz Bistro on chance. After glancing at the menu, we decided to stay. We are so glad we did!! I had a smoked chicken salad sandwich and a side salad with berry vinaigrette that was amazing! They didn't have any items on the menu specifically for kids, but said they would make them some plain pasta. We had a quiet, leisurely lunch (only 4 other people in the place) and topped it off with delicious cheesecake for dessert. The portion was large and I took half my sandwich home to enjoy later. If we are ever in the downtown Mesa area again, we will go back!

We have returned several times and the service time has improved! We like all the entertainment available for our kids too (TV, coloring books, games). My son loves to get just a plain crepe and my daughter is hooked on the nutella. Glad to have this caf√© so close to home!

Dr. Chad Stewart attempted to come to my rescue! I walked into his office with a severe migraine just prior to closing time to find out what they do for headache management. I have never been to a chiropractor before and migraines are fairly new for me. So far I have not responded to migraine medication and I am looking for other options. Dr. Stewart could tell I was in a lot of pain. He took me next door to the Urgent Care and recommended I get a Toradol shot. Unfortunately, there was a problem with my insurance, so they attempted to look it up and find out what the co-pay would be. They couldn't get that information at the time, but they took a copy of my card and set me up with an appointment for the next day.  When I went in the next day, the office was very busy. They were only open from 9:00 - 12:00. Everyone was very friendly, but I could tell that I was being squeezed in.  First I was put on a table for electromagnetic muscle relaxation. Then, they took a full history. Next, I had a nice massage that focused on my neck and shoulders. While I was waiting for the next step I sat in a massaging chair. Then Dr. Stewart did a neuro exam with me and took x-rays. Next a PA from Urgent Care came over to assess my situation, prescribe some new medications for migraines, and get me that Toradol shot.  I had to wait quite awhile for the shot.  After the shot, it wasn't clear if I was done next door with the chiropractor because we never reviewed my x-rays. Dr. Stewart said I was good to go and we would review the x-rays on Monday. The whole experience took about 3 hours. Normally, I wouldn't have that much time to spend, but I took off work. I really like that the Chiropractic office, PT, and Urgent Care are all connected. My only complaint is that it was not very private and really loud/had bright, irritating lighting for a migraine sufferer.  Migraine has not completing gone away yet, but I do feel better tonight...   I hope this will be a solution for me, but I do worry about what the cost will be if my insurance doesn't pick it up!

Happy hour was packed (and no parking to be found!) with a long wait time, so I decided to grab a brushetta to go and was outta there with my food in under 10 minutes. It was still warm and fresh when I got home, so this might be an option for you if you don't want to wait!   The cucumber lemonade was interesting too!

I love Zonie Baskets! I ordered something for my dad for father's day and had it shipped to Wisconsin. The owner also threw in a free gift!

We are not vegetarian, but heard good things and it's right in our neighborhood, so wanted to check it out. I tried the lemon poppy seed pancakes with strawberry compote and they were very good! My husband had the dragon 'burger' and he really enjoyed that as well with a side of hummus and veggies. The juices and smoothies seem interesting, but I'm not sure if I'm brave enough to try them...We liked the atmosphere and we will return to try more new things here!

We love Scooptacular in Laveen! I can't get enough of the Cookie Monster icecream and my husband loves the Soy vanilla - nice alternative. I send him over there at least a couple times per week to pick us up a yummy treat. We like the little tables and movies playing for the kiddos too. Even though my son doesn't like icecream, he enjoys going over there!   You know you are a fan of Scooptacular when over half of your spoons in the drawer are pink or blue!

I recently tried going to Prime Dental in Laveen because they are close to my home. I have also previously gone to Laveen Dental and Southwest Dental in Laveen. I was not impressed with any of them.  At Prime Dental I had Dr. Flowers. He was friendly during my exam, but when I came back for fillings, he was all business. Went right to work giving me shots without a greeting. The procedure took a VERY long time. He never checked in with me to see if I was alright. My head was practically on the floor with my feet in the air. Water was sprayed all over my face and dripping off. I was highly uncomfortable and in a lot of pain. Left with heavily bleeding, swollen gums. I went home and took my strongest pain reliever....I've never had to do that before and I've had a lot of work done in my mouth. I will not be returning.   Even if you live in Laveen, I recommend traveling to a dentist that will make sure you are as comfortable as possible.

Amazing little place for lunch! We really liked the atmosphere and we were the only ones dining there for lunch on a Saturday! I had sandwich #1 and it was superb! It was nice they had some samples out to try too. The kids even liked it there!

I had pecan-crusted french toast and it was delicious! I love that our kids can run around and explore while we are waiting for our food to come. Nice, tranquil location!

This place waited until I was completely out of my prescription before telling me I needed to come in for an appointment before they would refill it. Then, they couldn't make me an appointment for a month! This is too long for me to wait - I need my medication now. They also didn't inform me that my doctor moved to another practice. They don't care.
