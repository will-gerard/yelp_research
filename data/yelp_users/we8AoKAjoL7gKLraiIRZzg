I got a bad infection in my finger after I went there. Dr told me it was from getting nails done.when I was there they where very busy . I was there to get pedicure and manicure. I sat there for about 1 1/2 hrs with my feet soaking before they started on me. I did not realize it was that long. I was reading and did not pay attention to the time. As they were doing my pedicure. I was watching everything going on. They we're not allowing the instruments to sit in the thing to sterilize for very long. A few minutes if that. Then after someone was done getting a pedicure I never saw them clean the bowls out. That is just gross.
