Great Dealership! It was fun buying a car through plaza motors. I was in and out in a flash. I'll definitely come back.

I've been in a dealership industry for 7 years so, I know my way around deals. I have to say that this is by far the worst dealership I have ever come across. Their sale tactics are to bullying you into a buy. Plus, they talk over you and not once listen to what you have to say. After I left the next morning I got a phone call asking why I didn't purchase through them. Well when I was honest with my response they hung up on me. I'm so surprised they would even manage to sell anything.
