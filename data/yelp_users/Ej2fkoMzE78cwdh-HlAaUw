Their copy department is rad. Good service and reasonable pricing for quick print jobs.

I remember my parents taking me to boston market when I was a kid in California. There's just something about their comfort food that sits right in my belly. Always a good experience at this location in Tempe. Foods good. Always satisfied.

I've been here a few times as well as ordered out and it's been good all around. Wings and pizza are their specialty and I stick to both. Always good.

This place is great for last minute things when going out for a weekend adventure but it's not the size of the store or the selection they offer that bothers me about this location...it's the lack of customer service. I've been into this store multiple times and have never been acknowledged. No "hello" or "can I help you find something?" I've been in, looked for what I wanted, waited for assistance, and have walked out every time without making a purchase or speaking to an employee. That's not good customer service....anywhere.

While on vacation a friend with a key to our house broke the key off in our front door. He called these guys and they came out and changed our front door locks without any I.D., questions, proof of residency, nothing. Charged him $140 for a couple mins labor with a screwdriver, then when we get back and call regarding this happening without our or our landlords authorization they DENY coming out and doing the job. Real class business, if I'm not bummed on the security of my house, its their business ethic and moral.

My wife and I did a lot of research when looking for our Honda Element and these guys did not disappoint. Real great service and honest ethics make this dealership a diamond in the rough. Real friendly and no hassle made our experience quick and an easy decision. I truly will be recommending these guys to any friends that live in the area!
