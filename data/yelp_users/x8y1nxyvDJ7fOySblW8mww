Coworkers and I frequent this place occasionally and we are never dissapointed. Portions are huge, quality is good and prices are low. Every time I go I fail to order the 1/2 chicken off the grill and regret it... maybe I'll get smart one of these days.

Came in with my co-workers a few times and had to write a review.  This place just blew me away.  The amount of good food you get for such a small price was shocking.  My order of Mongolian Beef was practically falling off the plate and after everything including tip I only forked up $10.  Place is quick as well which is a big plus for lunch hour plans.  Highly recommend this place for anyone working near the Capitol.

Taken many a date to this resturant.  Great sushi, deals are very good during sushi happy hour.  It is a bit small insude,  Don't get there during rush or you will not be getting a seat.  Overall 7/10 for me :)

One step above a hole in the wall buffet place.  Food was edible.  Very bland, service was very un-attentive and my egg roll was soggy to boot.  I'll take my money elsewhere.

Visited last night with the wife.  She is a big Indian food fan and she has been introducing me to the cuisine.  I have to say this place was great.   The only thing I would say is that we ordered each dish medium heat and it tasted as though there were no spice at all.  Food was great and the price was very reasonable.  Snagged up a coupon on restaurant.com and  we ate for a very low price.

Dropped in by off chance when we were out and about and sure was glad I did. The place has a unique fusion of japan and ikea for decoration. The food was just great. My wife had curry chicken and i chose the bento box with lemon chicken and teriyaki chicken. Everything was just amazing. If you are in the are I would definatly recomnend.

I would give this place a 2.5 but since I can't I'm going to give it a 2.  I was not impressed with this place although I should have been.  The place was lively and comfortable.  Peanut shells on the floor and a Jack-elope bust on the wall always make me feel at home.  The waitress was great but this is where this review takes a turn for the worst.  I ordered the full rack of ribs and my wife got the steak.  The appetizer salads they brought out were so filled with cheese and very buttery croutons that there was less veg than toppers.  The big problem were the ribs for me.  They were dry, and I mean bone dry which is no good.  My wife's steak was huge and done well so no complaints.  We finished it off with apple pie that had a strange carmel topping on the side that spread like warm taffy... not impressed.  Not the worst but I have definitely seen better.  Price isn't too bad for a "steak house," but Ill take my business elsewhere next time.

The selection is great but unfortunately the prices are high. They do price match, even with Amazon.com, which is a good thing.  If you go know what your looking for, it's easy to go waaay over budget.

I'm not sure what changed but something has happened with the shrimp. I have never been, nor am I now, allergic to shtimp. If I eat shrimp literally anywhere else I have no issues.  The last 2 times I visited Red Lobster, this location and the one near PV mall, I have had an allergic reaction. I mean I'm itching and breaking out in hives allergic. I played it off the 1st time as a fluke since I have been to RL dozens of times but after 2nd time in a row it was settled. I'm not 100% sure it's the shrimp or the biscuits or what but it's no good.

If only the food were as good as the atmosphere.  This place has tons of character. It's small but lively. The staff is really friendly as well and that's always a plus. Problem is that the subs are nothing special. They taste like anything I could make at home in 5 minutes or less.  When I end up going I feel like there is way too much bread like one of those pre made grocery store subs. Also the prices are high. It's really close to work but honestly the DES building down the street has a cafeteria that does subs on Thursdays. Quality is the same, DES portions are about 50% bigger and with chips and drink it's still about half the price.

There's a reason everyone calls this place La Canasty. Only saving grace is I can get a breakfast burrito at 6 am before I get to work.  Other than that the meat is grade D, like boiled meat, and the tortillas are really thick and never toasted on grill. Place is dirty as hell and prices are too high.

Was planning to go to Burger Works next door but we arrived late and the place was jam packed for lunch rush.  Decided to walk across the lot to Persian Garden and I'm glad we did.  The place reminded me of may of the Mediterranean places around phoenix with the usual d√©cor; nothing extravagant but comfortable. We looked over the menu and decided on the Mediterranean salad to split, the falafel pita and the gyro.  The kids split a grilled cheese.  Everything was very good.    The salad was huge, enough to split between 2-4 depending on party size.  I had the gyro which had tender meat and a really tasty taziki sauce, probably the best one I've eaten in phoenix.  My mother had the falafel and reported it was quite good as well.  Ended up eating the remainder of the grilled cheese the kids didn't eat and wow what a surprise.  Not the typical American cheese on white bread.  It had the flavor of parmesan on a good wheat bread with herbs, very atypical and a pleasant surprise.  If your in the area, and like Mediterranean dining, I suggest dropping in for lunch.

Came in with coworkers. This place is excellent. I had the carne asada burrito and it had tender steak that melted in my mouth. The guacamole inside was heavy on the citrus which made it pop. If you are downtown and want a good Mexican place to drop in i would really recommend La Pinata!

I will never return to this restaurant.  I have seen the commercials and decided to try the place out.  1st thing that I noticed was that every plate is 1/2 full with fries and/or fried onions.  I love fries and fried onions but when I'm paying around $17-20+ a plate the fries had better come on an extra plate.  I felt like the food was mediocre for the expensive price.  I decided to return again and ordered the crab cakes, big mistake.  The things smelled and tasted rancid, and I'm not using that term figuratively.  They exchanged them for some fired shrimp but the damage had been done.  Again the prices were way too much for below par food and the amount of plate filler is unacceptable.  To top it off both times I was there the place seems to have staff, mainly teenagers, standing around chatting but no one is doing any work.  Bad food, high prices and poor service pretty much sums up this gem.  If you're in the mood for seafood I would strongly recommend against this place.

Food was pretty good but the prices are HIGH and it's so loud. Scared my 2 year old every time it started storming (every 15 min or so).  Place is loud in general due to waterfall.

Love greek food and if you want a great dining experience highly recommended.  Grab a coupon from http://www.restaurant.com/ and save a bundle.    We headed out for an early birthday celebration this Saturday and had a great time. Food is top notch and I can't get enough of that gyro meat dipped in tzatziki, OPA!

I absolutely love Ikea. I've been frequenting this location for years all the way from 20 something bachelor to married with 3 kids and there are affordable options for every stage of life. I won't try and fool anyone, the furnature is not lifelong quality but the prices are affordable on nearly any budget.   I love the way they set up the rooms to give you a real sense of the furnature and products in a living situation. I'd suggest anyone, from dorm days to decorating the empty nest give Ikea a go.

I have been here a few times and went out with wife and parents for a pre Valentines day get together.  I was not disappointed.  The food is wonderful and very authentic.  The atmosphere is amazing and the place is filled to the brim, make a reservation.  I love this place and would recommend it to anyone.  FYI Haus Murphy's is generally packed so a reservation is helpful but not necessary.  Also it is not as cheap as a trip to Chili's, so be prepared to spend $35 and up if you want the full experience, obviously more if you are going to have drinks.  My recommendation is to try something new off the appetizer menu when you go!

Overall this place is a big disappointing.  I guess because Maricopa has such a small selection of sit down restaurants quality and customer service is optional.  I've been in a total of three times and have had no good experiences.  The food is a joke, nothing worth the prices being charged, definitely below the quality I would expect from such a widely respected chain.  The sub-par food is enough to keep me away but the experience I had with our waitress my last time really punctuated my decision not to return.  I had ordered a side of guacamole with my meal and when everything arrived it had forgotten, honest mistake.  I didn't really care that much so I proceeded to eat my meal without it and was again not impressed.  At the end when the check came sure enough there was the $1 charge for the side.  I pointed out to the waitress that she needed to remove the charge because the side was missed.  Here comes the shocker, the waitress began to scold me for not telling her when the meal came out!  She told me next time I need to tell her before the check arrives  Had it not been for my mother-in-law I would have let the girl know how rude and unprofessional she was about her mistake, I'm the customer I only need to know what I want to order.  She went on to rattle off something about how she had already been dinged for a similar circumstance, then begrudgingly gave me a dollar out of her own pocket, I assume so she wouldn't get reprimanded by her boss.  My take on this place, leave it.  0 for 3 I will not be returning.

Best Pizza for the price.  I was so relieved to see Barro's when I first moved to Maricopa.  If you are looking to get some top tier cheap pizza look no further.  I must frequent this place at least once a month, when I lived in Phoenix it was 2-3 times a month.  Great pizza on the cheap look no further than Barro's.

Daughter was born a week ago and everything went great. We were checked in quickly and the nurses were great. Best part was how quickly we were discharged the next day. Anyone whos had a baby knows that by the next day all you want to do is get that little bundle of joy home. All tests were done and we were out just after lunch.   Only thing i would reccomend would be to add small refrigerators to post partum rooms. Its a small but significant addition.

I'm a big fan of Barros so it sucks that i have to give this particular Barros such low marks. We went in and wow the place was just so asteticly unpleasing... The Barros in Maricopa is 10x more comfortable.   The quality of the pizza was sub par. All the pizzas were slightly burned and covered in grease. Lastly there were flies buzzing about. When my friend pointed it out to the waitress she seemed very smug as she asked him, "what should we do about it?" Put up some fly paper, clean the place out. Very unprofessional. Big dissapointed compared to the other locations around the valley.

Abandon ship!!!  This place has been my UFC hangout for years and over the past few months has taken a turn for the worst.  Place is a sports bar yet TV's are dropping and not getting replaced.  5 dollars cover for UFC gets me a room where 2 TV's are missing (out of 6) and one is playing college football.  Staff can't operate the feeds so preliminary fights are on one TV in the adjacent room for 40 minutes till they figure it out.  I expect this place to either get there act together or close doors right quick.  Will not be returning and that saddens me.  Be warned place is quickly taking on dive status.  Take your money and buisness elsewhere.

This place is simply amazing.  If this place didn't break the bank I would be there all the time.  The crab cakes covered in rich sause with crawdad's is unbelievable.  Atmosphere draws you in and the service is top notch.  It is pricey but once you taste the food you will understand the price.

Overall this place was dissapointing. It looks great inside, very hopping place. The food on the other hand was underwhelming.    Portions were small, prices were high and overall quality was mediocre.  They had a dragon roll that was $17 that's outrageous.  I had a bowl of sashimi with 10 cuts of fish... the pieces were very small and the design of the bowl made eating it difficult. Even the soba with cold dipping sauce was $8 and was maybe 1 cup of soba.   The staff was friendly and on the ball which is always a plus but there is much better sushi for the prices this place was charging. Wouldn't bother returning.

Took the family out for my fathers birthday and he was recommended Blue Adobe Grille by some of his colleagues.  The food was simply amazing.  The New Mexico flavors were such a welcome relief from the standard Mexican food.  Food was spicy as well, which was a welcome surprise.  I would recommend to anyone who wants Mexican with a twist.

Came back to enjoy dinner with an aunt who is from the east coast. She wanted a good southwest meal and Blue Adobe Grill was the 1st thing that came to mind. Just like last time it didn't dissapoint. Everything was top notch. I tried the chili rellano with red sauce and my wife had enchanted garden enchilada.  Both dishes were so go and with that spicy kick we expected.  Best mexican in AZ.

My wife and I decided to stop in at Arriba for our weekly date night.  I ordered the white sands chimichanga and my wife ordered the carnitas.  My overall impression was underwhelming.  My chimichanga was covered in a white cheese that tasted like velveta (gross) and the tortilla was quite tough.  My wife's carnitas were good but were $16.00 which I find to be too high.  The one good thing were the server and manager.  Both were very friendly and attentive.  My wife had a question about the cream cheese they used and the manager found out and told us.  So kudos for that.  All in all I was unimpressed and would not bring my business here when there are so many better options in my opinion.

I have been to a number of Buca's across Phoenix.  I am a fan of the food and the unique atmosphere.  Perfect place to have a party, in fact I had my college graduation party here a few years back and it was a blast.  Place was designed for family sized gatherings.  My only gripe is that this place is not really designed for one or two people.  In smaller groups the bill seems very high and the portions seem to be a bit lacking, your wallet can take a real beating if you want to have a diverse experience.  Still I give this place a big thumbs up, just make sure you book a party and visit the pope room.

This place is an absolute disgrace.  Arrived and was seated.  Looked through the menu and there were some good options.   Our party ordered and it was all downhill from there.  I ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta.  The Price was quite a bit and the quality didn't come close, the portion was small and the "garlic bread" was 2 breadstick that look like they came from a grade school cafeteria...    My girlfriend and her father ordered steaks both medium rare, they came 10 minutes after everyone else's food and both were well done.  Her daughters Corn-dog from the kids menu was literally sopping with grease.  Applebee's appears, from the menu and the prices, to be a competitor to Chili's but overall is a complete joke.  If you want this style food at the same prices and want it to be good go to Chili's.  Applebee's is an absolute disaster, bad food, small portions and mediocre service.  I would strongly recommend against!

I love eclectic little places and this is just that. It used to be a coffee house for the freaks, like I was, called the Willow House back in late 90's but now it's an artsy bistro. They have salads, sandwiches and tea/coffee. It's got great ambiance with local art for sale along with food.  Since it is a converted house you can eat in different rooms or outside if the weather is nice. If your in the area I would definitely recommend stopping in for a visit.

I thought this place was going to be the typical cheap burrito joint but boy was I wrong. This place really does the food well. I love the prime rib tortas or the carne asada burrito. But more than the great food this place has mexican ice cream, a selection of pastries and even makes cakes. Also the place is very clean and lively. A big thumbs up in my book!

Took my wife for our anniversery and I'm glad I chose Ko'Sin. I'll be the 1st to tell you I've not been exposed to the finer things so to me this place felt like a Michelin star resturant.   The place was beautiful, great colors, relaxed feel, great view of a sun soaked golf course. Had a rustic chic thing going on, really nice.  We started with the smoked meats and cheese appetizer,  it was stupendous.  I ordered a rare filet mignon with the horseradish mash potatoes and 5 cheese creamed spinach.  The filet was 1 1/2 inch thick and just melted in my mouth. My wife ordered the herb roasted chicken beast with duck fat saut√©ed brussle sprouts that were to die for. For desert i had the strawberry shortcake and vanilla ice cream while my wife ordered the way to big chocolate cake with berries. Both were divine.  I was slightly worried because of a number of negative Yelp reviews but I could not have been more pleased. The waiter was the best. Super nice, very helpful and very available. Nothing is worse than having to flag down your waiter for more water, not the case here. My glass never ran dry. Big thumbs up, made the right choice for my anniversary.

Chili's has been a go too for me for years.  Have frequented this location may times over the years, probably 5-7 times a year, as well as other locations.  Has always been consistently good food, great atmosphere and acceptable price.  I was sad when they removed the Cajan chicken sandwich from the menu :( but have no complaints.  Highly reccomend this, and every other Chili's in the valley.

Bad... just bad. I love Chinese food, even mediocre Chinese food but this place is just plain bad. My wife order General Tso's chicken and I got the the buffett. My wife's plate was as bad as the food under the heat lamps. Dry... so dry. Most the food was bland and the rice was dry and tasted burned. How this place has lasted so long is a mystery.  If you want Chinese leave Maricopa.

My wife and I decided to give this place a go for my belated birthday. Admittedly we have avoided this place because Maricopa resturants typically leave a lot to be desired.  Much to my pleasant suprise Just Say Sushi was not a letdown. We ordered the 15 piece sashimi plate, a spicy tuna roll and a dragon roll with cucumber salad as a starter. Everything was quite good and the sashimi had really large cuts. My only complaint was with as busy as it was, with people waiting for tables and getting pickup non stop, a larger space would be of value.  All in all Just Say Sushi was quite good. Not the best sushi in AZ but a very good option if you don't feel like trekking to Chandler.

This place is no good at all.  My wife loves the slushes so every once in a while she will pick up lunch/dinner.  After the last time I told her enough was enough.  Food is always cold and greasy as all get out.  My Texas toast was so soggy from grease it was hardly edible.    Service is slow, prices are high and the food sucks.  No thank you.

I guess Walmart moved its Yelp page?  So I'll move my prior review.  What can you say. There was a time when Walmart was an industry leader by using inventory control techniques that made sure they were always on top of supply and there stores always had what you were looking for.   Apparently inventory control, along with employee wages, and just employees in general, started cutting into the bottom line because Walmart has become the store Kmart became in the early 2000s. Understaffed by a bunch of people who are so underpaid they don't give a thought to doing a good job or caring to help anyone. The store looks like something out of a post apocalyptic movie with shelves half empty and disorganized. Some of the most basic items go unstocked for months.  The Maricopa Walmart is one of the worst I have encountered in Arizona. I know they have low prices, but even those have steadily increased in the last few years. Poor stock, poor appearance/cleanliness and an overall we don't give a damn attitude best sum up the Maricopa Walmart.

This is the McDonalds inside Walmart. This is by and far the worst McDonalds i've ever been too. The shake machine is perpetually broken but they wont tell you at untill after they serve you a cup full of room temp shake mix with 5 times the amount of syrup in it... disgusting. The burgers are all sopping with grease and nasty.  More than the dismal quality of the food is the crew. Everyone is a teenager, which is not suprising, but everyone has a dont give a damn attitude. There all acting so unprofessional.  Hopefully the coroprate office cleans this place up or shuts it down. The one in town is great...

Dear Pizza Hut:  Why is your pizza so bad? Yesterday my father in law decided to forgo my "suggestion" to call Barros and order a pizza with you. When the pizza arrived I was immediately shocked,  saddened and reminded why I vowed I would never deal with you again.  Pizza is inherantly greasy due to hot pepperoni and sausage combined with meted cheese but somehow you have figured out a way to add even more grease. The crust to your pizza is coated as though you attempted to deep fry the thing in cold oil. As I held the soggy slice, and began to think about where I had left the antacids.  This experience has reaffirmed why I swore you off 15 years ago and that I'm glad I did.  If I want pizza I will order it from Barros or pick up frozen red barron from anywhere because the quality of your product is so poor. How you have stayed in business all these years still baffles me...

Who knew eating healthy could taste so good. My wife absolutely loves this place and has gotten so much inspiration for our habits at home from this place. For me it's 5 stars for the food and atmosphere.  Only downside is its not cheap. You'll shell out to eat here. I do suggest their smoothies, excellent.

This place blew me away the food was great. The atmosphere is very authentic, the owner comes over and greets every table. The fillet mignon and the lamb were to die for. There selection of drinks is impressive, I don't drink but I still had to add a note.   Its a bit on the pricey side but luckily they advertise on the Resturants.com site so I hooked up a $50 off coupon for $4! Highly recommend this restaurant to any German enthusiasts.

Decided to try this place based on the positive yelp reviews.  All in all the trip was a disappointment.    Our food was mediocre at best; my wife's dish was smothered in peppercorn to the point where she was crunching through the whole thing, completely inedible.  We ordered the skewers of lamb that came unseasoned and very sinewy...  lastly the pan fried buns were like McDonald's hamburgers inside of a bun so much grease that the crispy buns were completely soggy and the grease just poured out onto the plate.  Lastly the staff was very unresponsive.  They were sitting in the kitchen in plain sight yet my drink was constantly empty and I couldn't seem to get them interested in coming over.  The only upside was that there Mongolian beef was quite good and the menu offered quite a bit of selection but it will not be enough to warrant a return visit.

This place does not dissapoint. It's not your typical taco joint. A unique fusion of Mexican and American, I mean you can get a rib eye torta with a side of fries, it's brilliant. Throw in a salsa bar with HOT jalepinios and smoky salsa, an ice cream booth and a selection of mexican bread/pastries and you have a sold 5 stars in my book. Grab your coworkers and head over for an excellent meal.

I get the idea behind having pizzas ready to go and for $5 they are cheap but honestly just drop into local grocery store and get a frozen Red Barron for lower price and way more quality. Little Ceasars fresh and ready pizza tastes like the cardboard box it comes in. Sauce is bland, cheese is crap, crust is tough.  Avoid what my friends refer to as prison pizza.

Now these guys make a mean sub. Quality is top notch. Service is quick and place is well layer out. Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the parking situation is the worst. The lot is for a bunch of businesses but is way to small. Trying to get in or out is like a scenario out of a mad max movie.

Having a farewell lunch for a coworker and we decided to try this place even though it is a bit far from where we work.  It was a real hole in the wall but that never deterred us before, sometimes you find some real gems.  The staff was very friendly and attentive which is always a big plus.  Now the menu is cheap so right off the bat I didn't have my expectations very high.  When I go to a questionable Chinese place for the 1st time I usually get teriyaki chicken to be safe.  When my chicken arrived it looked strange.  The chicken was cooked fine but the sauce was very light, like an amber color.  When I tasted it I discovered that they had either used a really cheap sauce or ran out and used maple syrup because it seriously tasted like Log Cabin on my chicken.  Also the fried rice tasted a tad burned and was very dry.  Since the meal was so cheap and since the staff was so nice we just laughed about it and honestly It wasn't the end of the world.  Will not return since China Chili is closer and much better.

We decided to stop in again and glad to report things were definitely better. The meat was great just like last time but the sides were much improved.  Glad to see they stepped it up and as a result my rating increased as well.

Things have improved over last few months. The quality control has really paid off. Place needs the carrots, onions and jalape√±os at salsa bar like other taco places and please reduce price of guacamole... $0.99 for a spoonful of guacamole is too much.

**WARNING BAD CONTRACTOR**  Not only is Marco the worst contractor I have ever dealt with, he also kept trying getting more money for everything we had already agreed on. He was unprofessional, incompitent, constantly late or no showing and tried to blame me for everthing he screwed up.  The whole job was completed and looked like hell. The bricks were just laid on the ground instead of cemented in so they were uneven, loose and sinking into yard. The sod had sat in rolls for 6 days so you can imagine how that looked. The yard was a bog because he didn't level and grade it correctly.  And to top it off he damaged my house and brick walls with his bobcat.   After I saw how poorly the job was done I threatened to file a claim against his bond with the Register of Contractors and he came over pounding on my door. He literally told me that if I wanted the job done right I should have paid him more needless to say I lost it. After a heated exchange I wrote an amended contract for all the things he would need to fix and he signed it.  He had his Mesa crew chief come out and in one day with a full crew and they fixed his terrible job. This guy was good on his word and the backyard is... acceptable. The rocks are still not evenly spread but by this point I just wanted them gone. A job that should have taken 2-3 days had taken over 2 weeks and a good portion of my sanity.  Word to the wise. DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY.

I was pleasantly surprised with the 347 Grill.  The menu offers something different for everyone and uses twists on classics to spice things up.  Prices were reasonable and the staff was very nice.  I will definately return for dinner and a movie across the way.  All things being said with the appalling lack of restaurant options in Maricopa this place is a lifesaver.

Visited Luxe Lounge to check out the UFC PPV (no cover charge); all in all it was a good trip.  The layout of the lounge is very comfortable.  The floor plan is open and they use a projector for a main screen, along with dozens of flat-screens.  We sat at a table but there are really comfortable looking loungers that we will probably take advantage of next time we head out.  The food was good and big portions.  The wings were decent and when we arrived they were on happy hour ($5).  The menu was a bit pricey but the fact that the wings were cheap and there was no cover made up for this.  Neither my wife nor I drink so I can not speak to the drink prices or quality.  Big thumbs up for Luxe Lounge, will definatly return for future PPV's.

Luxe Lounge killed it last night. Went to see the MacGregor vs Aldo UFC PPV and got there early enough to snag up the white lounging area. Vibe was great, fights were amazing, service was on point. It was a packed house and our cups were never dry.

This is a state of the art theater with the lounge and 347 grill attached. It's great because it's always so empty, I get there 15 min early and always get the seats I prefer.

Simply the best convenience store there is. Stores are clean, crew is friendly, selection of snacks/drinks are extensive and boy are they convenient. Puts Circle K to shame and you'll never want to step foot in an AM/PM again.

Very cool park with a ton of different things for kids of all ages. The covered play area filled with jungle gyms and slides blew me away.

I have used Farmer Juan since I moved to the city of Maricopa in late 2010 to trim my trees a couple times a year.  This spring I decided it was time to completely renovate my backyard and create a space suitable for my kids.  I contacted a number of landscapers and and had them complete estimates.   At the end of the proceeds Farmer Juan came out as the lowest by a significant amount.  Farmer Juan was very professional and worked with me when I had a few concerns about how things were coming along.  He had his crew make the necessary changes with no argument.  The job was done very quickly and it looks better than even I had imagined it would.  I would recommend Farmer Juan to anyone for any service ranging from yard cleanup and tree trimming to whole yard packages.

Just purchased a new home and it was in desperate need of clean floors, both carpet and tile.  Tech came out, quoted me and completed the job all in the same day.  Breathed new life into 3300 square feet, including some nasty tile.  I would highly recommend Stain Eliminator to anyone who needs a clean living space.

Wow this place blew me away. To start the atmosphere is great. Its very modern with low lights and great ambiant lighting, even our order had a blue LED light placed in the ice which was very cool. Even the windows are blacked out to help set the mood.  The menu is full and there are pleanty of options. My wife and i love a mix of sushi and sashimi so we went with the love boat for 2; it was wonderful. Another in group ordered a bento box that looked amazing.   All in all the food was great and the setting definatly added to the experience. I would definatly suggest this place and will be returning.

To preface this review I worked as a professional paint team for 2 years in my pre-college days.  As a result I am very skeptical of painters because I know all the tricks they can use to cut corners.  Recently purchased a new home in Maricopa and called Anthony at Fresh Look Painting.  He came out on time and walked the home with me going over my vision.  After we were done he provided an estimate that was very competitive.  During the process Anthony was very available, communicating via email about questions I had and making minor changes we discussed.  After all was said and done he was finished on time and the house looks better than I had imagined.  I would highly recommend Fresh Look Painting to anyone in the Maricopa area.

If it wasn't for 99 cents only store our budget would be much tighter. Our families meals are typically vegetable based and I was blown away when I saw their selection. Now like any dollar store you never know what they will have but typically there is a good selection of fruit/vegetables and that is saving my family (of 5)  between $100 - $200 monthly.   99 cents only store has become the 1st stop for our grocery needs and they also have plenty of odds and ends. I would recommend anyone give them a chance.

I was very impressed with Copper Sky. My 3 year old son is taking swim lessons on Saturday mornings and the swim instructors are so great. He loves going to the pool. The facility is large and offers super affordable daycare for parents who want to hit the gym for an hour. Pool is great and so many activities to sign up for. I'm glad that maricopa decided to give something back to the community.

My wife and I were excited to see an new restaurant pop up where the old Teakwoods once was and were hopeful that it would really be a competitor to Penascos.  My overall review of Plaza Bonita is that it is painfully average and incredibly underwhelming.  This is nothing more than an standard run of the mill Mexican restaurant. That would not be a bad thing if they really nailed the food; which they didn't.  The first thing I noticed was that the chips and salsa that came out were sub par.  The chips were very thick and oily and the Salsa was completely liquid, no chunk of any kind save a few pieces of onion floating inside.  Mind you this was supposed to be garden salsa, which should be very chunky, not a chipotle that one would expect to be without chunk.    I ordered the Enchiladas Deluxe and when I asked if they could put Carne Asada inside instead of shredded beef.  I was told they had no Carne Asada, so I went with chicken...   Good thing I didn't go with my initial thought which was Carne Asada tacos.  When the plate arrived immediately I noticed that the refried beans were like puree so they were runny and I am fairly sure they were out of a can.  The rice was bland and again tasted like something seasoned with a pre-packaged seasoning mix.  The enchiladas were... enchiladas... but the tortillas were thick and spongy so they also didn't earn high marks.    Everyone else I was with had about the same impression with their meals.  The food wasn't terrible but it was just something you can get at any Mexican restaurant, both sit down and drive thru, and was not executed well.  I can go anywhere and get Mexican food so why would I choose to spend money at just another Mexican restaurant when I can choose Penascos, On the Border, Macayos, Blue Adobe Grill, etc?  All said in hindsight I would have rather taken my money to Federicos and spent about 1/5 the price... Hell at least at Federicos I know they are going to have Carne Asada.

This place is a breath of fresh air in a world dominated with high calorie low nutrition fast food options.  The feel of the resturant was a very modern take with a traditional japanese twist. It was very inviting and relaxing. Big thumbs up on atmosphere.   The place is designed to provide healthy, low calorie options. My wife ordered tofu with double vegetables instead of rice or noodles with a green curry sauce.  Has a sample, very tasty and fresh. I had the 8 piece spicy tuna roll and an order of cucumber salad. For the $1 the salad cost I was pleasantly suprised at the size and quality,  photo included. The roll was very good, on par with any standard sushi resturant. There are about 8 options on sushi so not bad for a "fast food" style resturant.   A big perk was they offered 5 types of iced teas to choose from. I love tea and feel like most resturant offer it as a side thought to the cokes so big plus in my book.   I am giving this place a solid 5 stars and will definatly return in the future. For less than $10 I got a cucumber salad, really tasty tuna roll and drink. Thank you for giving me an option to do healthy in a hurry Tokyo Joes.

Been waiting for a good taco shack in Maricopa and it finally arrived. I can't stand Tacos and More and Cilantros is just too pricey for all the rice/beans in my carne asada. It's exactly what I've been waiting for the great chain taco shop.

Thank goodness for Goodwill. I have 2 small children that need a lot of cloths. Goodwill is the spot to get kids cloths on the cheap. Have found full sheet sets, shoes, toys and so much more.

I love sea food and I loved the Angry Crab Shack.  Wife and I came in for a date night using a gift certificate and tried a bag with 2 pounds of crab, a grilled meat platter for 2 and an appetizer of gator bites.  I'm glad that the waitress explained that when you add spice to the bag hot means hot.  We ordered mild and that had me sweating a bit.  Everything was so good.  I will definitely return.

Other burger joints better watch out. Freddies has the best fast food style burgers in the buisness. This was my 1st time trying them and the last time I'll go anywhere else for burgers in Maricopa.

My friends and I decided to check out this store after a friend who works in the area mentioned it.  Overall impression is very positive.  Place is large, has a good deal of stock, a bunch of tables and more terrain than I have ever seen available to mix things up.  There are tables set up to play card games or build and the counter has a good lighting setup for painting.  Staff was friendly and very helpful.  We had been going to the Games Workshop store, which is good as well but only a fraction of the size.  Will defiantly be returning and would would recommended Odyssey Games to anyone looking to get some tabletop war gaming in.

My wife and I stopped in after she discovered this place and saw that so many fellow Yelpers were impressed. I have to throw my lot in with everyone else. The food was wonderful. We ordered the shrimp korma and goat curry. Both were just perfect, the shrimp was succulent and the korma was thick and delicious. We ended with home made pistachio ice cream that was probably the best dessert I've ever tasted.  Staff was so friendly and super attentive; even gave us free sample of the mango lassi, which was just perfect.  If your in the mood for Indian food this is a must.
