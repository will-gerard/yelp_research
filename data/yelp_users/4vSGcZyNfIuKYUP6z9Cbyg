Go to Lindstroms on Indian School!!!!!!!!  Its been 3 or 4 weeks since I last washed my car, so I took it to Danny's yesterday because the location was more convenient than Lindstroms - Trader Joes was on my to-do list.  I had little mud splatters on one side of the car - somebody must have driven through a puddle while I was parked.  But I was getting the car washed for general reasons, not just because of the mud splatters, so I made the mistake of not looking closely after Danny and his Family were done washing.  When I got back home, I noticed most of the little mud splatters were still there.  My first thought was "sh%t, its paint and not mud" but I scraped one with my finger and it came right off.  And there are water spots all over one window, coffee and dust in the cup holder, etc etc.  So now I need to go back and argue with a manager, or pay again at Lindstroms.  I think I will pay again and go to Lindstroms - I've been a big fan ever since they got raided by the Country's Worst Sheriff:)  You get raided by Sheriff Joe, you must be doing something right.

Its hard to put into words what makes Postino so enjoyable.  The bruschetta/sandwhiches/salads are great, the wine is great, the staff is great, and the building is great.  But Postino is even better than the sum of its parts.  The view out of the big open garage doors is relaxing and chill, the staff has a cool Urban Outfitters-type vibe, and.... my favorite...  $5 wine before 5pm (or $5 pitchers)!!!  Three out of every four Sundays my wife and I are there around 4, sharing a bittersweet moment reminiscing about the weekend that passed and discussing the work week to come.  Yesterday she said "I wish we could find a Postino on every vacation we take."    I think that sums it up - I always feel like I'm relaxed on a little vacation when I'm at Postino.

Haven't been to the doctor in 5 or 6 years, so I thought I would go and get checked out.  My insurance covers preventative care 100% and I have a large deductible for sick visits.  I went, had no health complaints, and the nurse told me I was the healthiest person she had seen all day.  The practice then billed a sick visit code to my insurance, which applied $130 to my deductible.  I called the billing number, explained the situation, and asked that they bill the prevantative visit code to my insurance.  The billing person told me the doctors pick the code, not the billing people, but he would check with the doctor and call me back the next day.  He never called.  I left two voicemails for the billing guy, which he never returned.  I appealed to my insurance, who denied because the doctor used a sick visit code.  Sooo, my doctor is still sending me bills for the prevantative visit that is covered 100% by my insurance.  The office is yet to explain the "problem of medium to high severity" described is the CPT code.  The only diagnosis billed is V70.0, adult well visit.  This post is probably more about the billing dept, but still makes me mad.

Probably the best pizza place in town.  Not a take-the-entire-little-league-team kind of place, but more pizza for grownups.  Great location, wonderful ambiance, extensive (and affordable) wine list, good salads, and excellent pizza.  And the tira mi su is awesome.   The napoli pizza reminds me of the pizza I devoured while in Italy, but I think Grazie's is better.    And if you are trying to impress a date, but don't want to break the bank, Grazie should be your choice.

Best Mexican (southwestern, spanish?) food in town.  No competition.  First, I'll adress some common complaints - yes, its in a rough neighborhood.  Could the best Mexican restaurant in Phx be located at Fashion Square or north Scottsdale?  Hell no.  As for parking, ever been to a large metropolis (Phx doesn't count)?  Finding parking is part of the adventure.  There is a wait - wouldn't you be worried if a place this small was half-full?  And yes, the Guacamole is basic, but that's exactly how its supposed to be - if a blender or food processor is involved, its not gonna be good.    The slow roasted pork is absolutely incredible.  The margarita's are great, and the wife and I even split an expensive shot of tequila (thanks to the big spenders at the next table over for the inspiration).  The Tilapia was also really good.  Finished the night with some amazing churros.    Great mix of incredible food and ecclectic location/decor.

Its probably not fair to review restaurants in one's "regular rotation."  We went once a week for about 7 years, but the last two its only been once every six months (due to a new neighborhood, the opening of Hanny's, and the relocation of our favorite dining partner).  And why did we go once a week?  --Cheap food and expensive drinks.  The appetizers are great (my fave is the hellfire chips), the salads are great too (and big), and the chicken sandwhichs come with a whole chicken breast - big enough to order w/o a bun and still leave with a full stomach.  And if you are into those foo-foo martini's, they have the best in town.  And always FILLED to the brim.  If not, they have a great selection of everything else.  --Great people watching.  There's a diverse mix of people - gay, straight, families, retirees, etc.  Fridays and Saturdays are best for this.  --Cool spot.  Michael Johnson did a great job designing the place.  If the name didn't give it away, I'm guessing very few people would know the restaurant has been there 22 years - the building still looks modern and contemporary.  Lots of glass, big white walls - classic.  I highly recommend AZ/88.  Its a fancy restaurant with $12 meals.  PS - a lot of people complain about the location, but its a great location.  Its on the Scottsdale Civic Center mall next to the Scottsdale Center for the Arts, SMOCA, and the library.  I suppose the folks complaining would prefer it in a strip mall next to Walmart.  Sorry.

On Sunday I had the best breakfast ever.  Not the kind of breakfast you eat on the go before work - more like the breakfast you eat after hiking Camelback or running 6 miles.  Carne adovada with eggs, beans, potatoes, cheese, and tortillas.  Red chile sauce.  The room smelled like a campfire.   So so good.  I would also like to take this oppurtunity to thank the idiot legislators who passed the law whereby I cannot order a Bloody Mary before 10am on Sunday while enjoying the best breakfast ever at Dick's Hideway.  Why Sunday?  Some drunk can order one before work Mon - Fri, but I can't on my day off?  Well, at least I can still take my handgun with me....  Thank you for listening.

1.  Wash  Every time I wash the dog at home I wreak havoc on two different bathrooms and by the end my dog still smells like someone with B.O. who just sprayed on some cologne.  And because I have a dog instead of children, I'm way too nice - that hose water is waaaay too cold.  So I dump warm bathwater on him and his under-sides never get clean.  Wag n Wash provides a solution.  I mess up their place, not mine.  I use their warm-water hose to clean his underside.  Then I blow hair all over their establishment, instead of all over my bathroom.  Paying someone else to wash the dog is preferred, but this is a reasonably priced alternative that works better than a home wash.  2.  Food/Accessories  My dog eats healthier than I do, so I overpay for fancy food that uses ingredients I can actually pronounce.  Wag n Wash prices are equal to or less than Petco for my Solid Gold Wolf King - and I take comfort that my payments are going to a small business and not to a large corporation majority owned by some prince from a large oil producing country.  And their acessories are great too.

This is a great dog park.  Plenty of grass to run around on, and there is always a good crowd to play with.  And drinking fountains and places to sit.  The majority of the dogs are nice, but there are a few Scottsdale poodles who think they are the shit and their owners just ignore their bad behavior.  I just stick my gum in their curly hair and go on with my day.  The best part of the park is when I get home and the dog takes a nice long nap, and I can do chores in peace.

The jungle is the best.  My wife and I can get dinner and a bottle of wine for less than forty bucks.   And half their meals are to big to eat in one sitting.

Any review for Mastro's must be qualified by the phrase "its not cheap." Because if you are looking for a good meal for a decent price, this isn't the place for you.  Be mentally prepared for a large check or you won't enjoy.  I ordered a vodka martini, thinking I would have a red wine with dinner.  My $18 martini (including the extra in the shaker) ended up lasting through dinner and refilled my glass twice (last one was mostly water, but still...).  Doing some advanced math, one $18 martini is approximately... $2 cheaper than a $10 martini and a $10 glass of wine.  What a bargain!  Once every couple weeks I go to AJ's and overpay for some good filets, and despite my ineptitude with a grill they are awesome every time.  The filet I had at Mastro's BLEW AWAY my attempts at steakery.   I broke one of the ten commandments, I can't remember which one, and ordered it medium instead of medium rare, but it didn't matter.  I  savored every bite, in that way you can only savor a really really good steak.  And for $40 bucks I should be savoring.  The sides are all good - I''ve never had one I didn't like.  Two minor complaints - 1) maybe we were too close to the live music, because I couldn't hear a word my tablemates said; and 2) my wife ordered a house or chopped salad, but was brought some weird salad with crab. Probably because (see complaint #1) the waiter could not hear her.  Anyway, if you want a restaurant to enjoy a special occasion, head to any of the Mastro's places.  Or if you make a lot more $ than me, make Mastro's part of your regular restaurant rotation.

The only reason I am giving 2 stars is the beer.  As for the rest, imagine overpaying for not-so-good food in a restaurant that smells like dirty dishwater and looks like it came from chain restaurant heaven.  I guess I just prefer local restaurants over chains.

Great happy hour.  We are old, and arrived early, and didn't stay past the end of happy hour, so I can't review NoRTH's dinner.  4 people, 3 bottles of wine, 3 appetizers, 4 happy hours plates, and all less than $100.  The food is a mix of dishes that are eerily familiar.  The chicken sandwich is very similar to the breakfast sandwich at Olive & Ivy.  The gorgonzola chicken salad is the same salad I've had before at Sauce.  Good dishes, its just strange eating them in a strip mall on the west side.  Would it be worth the money after 6:30 pm, when bottles of wine are not half off?  Probably not, and NoRTH would have received a 3-star rating from me.

Was in the mood for tacos last night so we visited Blanco's but they had a half-hour wait, so walked next door to J. Alexanders.  I didn't know anything about the place, but I expected over-priced blandness for some reason.  It was much better than expected.  First, I had a $5 glass of Zinfandel that was quite good.  And a generous pour.    They had a wide range of menu choices from $10 to upper $20's.  I tried a filet mignon/mushroom/mashed potatoes dish that was very good.  My wife enjoyed her shrimp.  Many reviews compare this to Houstons - while I agree that Houstons is better, we left dinner last night with $50 more in our pockets compared to my last trip to Houstons.

This would be getting 5 stars if not for the service I have received.  I've been three times and twice felt neglected for long periods of time (and my "service" measuring stick is low - be friendly and keep an eye on my wine glass and you're my best friend).  I love the concept.  There are too many corporate chain restaurants (I know, True Food could be considered a corporate chain but I prefer not to think of it that way) that serve heaping plates of fat and salt filled belly bombs (Cheesecake factory) to clientele that has no business eating like that (Buy a mirror people!).  For those of us that try to keep up appearences, its nice to have a healthy option that makes a great attempt at pleasing the pallette in cool surroundings.  I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten at True Food, and I did not feel any bloated guilt when I left.

I needed to shave the bottoms off some doors after installing new flooring, and I found Duane "Diamond D" on this cool website called Yelp.com. I gave him a call and he came out the next afternoon - he sawed the doors, did a few other things around the house, was very pleasant to speak with, and the price tag came in less than I would have expected.   Highly recommended.

Qualification - I am rating the Healthy Marketplace side and not the coffee bar:  Just left a movie and wanted to pick up something quick/easy to go - drove by Luci's the other day so I stopped there to grab some chow.  The space itself is cool and has potential.  But...  1.  Many of the goods are the same as in the grocery (some stuff from regular groceries, other stuff from Sprouts/Trader Joes type places) but they cost more.  Five or six bucks for some healthy cereal.  In particular I was disappointed in the wine.  I guess its just my style, but I like a variety of affordable small-production wines.  They had small production wines, just not cheap.  And then they had the same Clois du Bois red wine that has been on sale for $8.99 in Fry's/Albertsons/Safeway for the last five years, except here it was $13.99. 2.  Grabbed a chef salad and a meatloaf sandwich to go.  Salad looked good (and was) - big pieces of chicken and egg - but,....   No dressing!!  The meatloaf was Ok at best, the bread was probably sliced and placed in the box 8 hours ago, and it came with 2 wedges (wedges for a sandwich?) of tomato and two little tiny strings of roasted red pepper.  I had high hopes based on the name/location/etc., but I was disappointed.  Maybe try some quirky grocery items and wines?

The Parlor is great.  They have a menu, with stuff on it, but my favorite is the sushi-style paper menu for ordering pizza.  I've never tried anything else, but my wife likes their salads.  Start with a 8-inch cheese for $6, then a buck for vegatables/add'l cheeses and 2 bucks for meat.  Add an ice-cold Bass (beer, not fish) and I am in heaven.  All the vegatables are from local farms, and the herbs are grown right outside the front door.  The urban redo of an old beauty parlor is great - exactly the type of development Phoenix should be encouraging.  Character is good.   Parking sucks.  In particular, if you are the jerk in the bronze mercedes who parked 6 inches from the driver side of my car despite the fact that I parked WAAAAAY over on the side of my spot on the end of the row, I regret to inform you that you have a large white door ding. You brought it upon yourself.

My dog spends two days a week at Tailwinds.  He can't get out of the car fast enough when I pull up.  He gets his exercise, socializes with other dogs, and then he is as tired as we are at night!   I highly recommend.

Happy hour - good prices, and goes to 7pm so that those of us with jobs can go - 4 stars  Pizza - it was pretty good, but not the best in town - 3 stars.  BUT..... no substitutions or additions to the pizza's - negative 6 stars.  Are you kidding me?  I was told it was because the chef "put a lot of time into the pizza combinations."  I ordered a margherita pizza - sorry chef, there are probably a million other chefs out there with cheese pizza's - you aren't the first.  I've spent 32 years eating pizza, so I'm pretty sure I know what I like.  And a poached tuna and caper pizza isn't it.  If you don't mind limited pizza choices, this might be a good place for you.  However, if you are like me, and don't like being told what you can and can't have on your pizza, then I would head over to The Parlor or Le Grande Orange Pizzeria or any other less pretentious pizza joint.

I've been to Bevmo once and vowed never to go back - same prices as the grocery store, just bigger.  So I really really thought I would dislike Total Wine.  BUT... I like wine, and I like booze, and I really like to pay the least amount possible for my wine and my booze.  Total Wine's prices are cheap, especially in the liquor section.  Blows away the grocery store.  Prices are comparable to Costco, but a much bigger selection.  I bought a bottle of Ciroc vodka for 24 bucks or something ridiculus.  BONUS - I stopped in Saturday after the gym and got to try 5 or 6 different wines.  And I'm a sucker so I paid for two bottles outside my normal price range.  Its really win-win for everybody.  WooHoo is right.

The Compound Grill was a big surprise for me.  Generally I shy away from restaurants in big strip malls and restaurants in North Scottsdale.  So a restauraunt in a giant strip mall in North Scottsdale?  First, there was live music playing while we ate.  We arrived early so there was no cover charge.  Just some nice background music while we dined.  Second, the menu was great.  LOTS of stuff for those of us who enjoy a healthy meal. I had mahi mahi with roasted vegetables and a big side salad, all for 16 bucks.   Most of the other options looked good too.  Third, they did a great job redecorating.  If it wouldn't have been pointed out, I never would have known it used to be a Black Angus.  One drawback - in between the patio and the stage were large screen TV's, and they were all turned on, and I don't like watching TV on Saturday nights.

Had dinner at Fred's last night.  I like the design, and a big window overlooks Scottsdale road.  Feels like being in a big city.  Advice - talk to the sales staff in the store on your way in, mention where you are headed (or mention you are considering Fred's) and they may give you a card for a free glass of wine.  It was good - expensive, but not terribly overpriced given the location.  The menu had lots of good choices - we had rigatoni with broccoli rabe recommended by the bartender, and the salmon - both were very good.   The salmon was cooked perfectly - I give them props - ever so slightly charred on the outside and moist on the inside.  When I cook salmon its usually soggy on the outside and dry on the inside.  Here's my two complaints:  I thought the wine list was overpriced.  But I always think the wine list is overpriced.  If I pay $10 for a glass of wine, it should be better than the $6.99 bottle I get at Trader Joes - they rarely are.  And, in Phoenix in July, a glass of water should be automatic - it wasn't last night.  I asked twice, and never received one.

Stopped by for a beer and a snack.  Temp was around 70 so we sat outside.  My amber ale from Breckenridge was good, and my wife ordered the cheaper of their Pinot Noir's and it was also good.  Waiter was friendly and genuine.  I like their anti pasti menu.  You can pick and choose what you want.  We tried the 12-hour roasted tomatoes, olives, some almonds, manchego cheese, and sopresseta.  It was all good.  We are eager to go back and eat dinner - the menu looked appetizing.

The food was surprisingly good here.  I say surprising because of the ambiance/atmosphere/service we encountered.  Ever go to a place and just feel uncomfortable?  First, there were 6 to 8 employees huddled in and around the small bar area.  Because there were few customers, they spent their time loudly discussing what they did the night before, what they were planning for that night, that one time in Vegas when they got into a VIP room, etc.   Folks walking by on the street are not going to come into your empy bar if the staff is all huddled in a circle talking.  Sorry.  It was almost comic watching one of the waiters sit at the bar and send text messages while the two hostesses took turns bringing him orders from his tables, debit cards from his tables, telling him he had new tables, etc..  Everytime he got up there was a look of annoyance on his face like his 6 customers were taking up too much of his time.  And why is the staff allowed to sit at the bar on shift???  Is it a break room or a bar?  I'm pretty sure the other group of people at the bar were friends of the bartenders and waitstaff.  They got a lot of attention, the staff even sat down next to them to talk.  If you want to focus your business on the bartenders' friends, and not the "outsiders" at your bar, you are going to have a tough time making your mortgage payments.  I'm guessing 3 months until there is some more available retail space in SoSco.  I give two stars because as I said, the food was surprisingly good, and one of the six barstaffers was a friendly guy.  Maybe he was the only one with restaurant experience, because he was doing ALL the work.   Good luck Urban 7, I won't be back.
