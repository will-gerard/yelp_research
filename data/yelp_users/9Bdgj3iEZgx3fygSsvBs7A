This is great medical office. The front office staff is friendly and professional.   I have seen a few of the doctors and 1 of the PAs. All were very good. I like the flexibility of the hours and of being able to call and get a same day appointment.   I have even taken my 3 yr old there because they provided the extended hours and we were able to avoid an ER visit. He was given excellent care.

I just love this place. Every time you go you can put a new twist on your meal by changing up the make-up of your sauce.   I always get a small bowl. You can still get way too much food and save money all at the same time.

I have taken a few suits here and have had great service every time. I love the drive-thru service and their staff is quick and friendly.  I have found their prices to be reasonable.

Yummy stuff. I can only comment on the dessert ones and in my opinion it is the best fry bread. Love to treat myself whenever I can.

Absolutely the most honest mechanic in Arizona. My whole family takes their cars to Dan. No matter whether it is a simple oil change or a complete A/C repair Dan's work is fast, reasonably priced, and most importantly it gets the job done.  The waiting room is small but there is usually a movie playing and I haven't had to wait long. I have referred Dan to so many people and always feel confident they will be just as satisfied as I am.

I used to come here when I was growing up. I like to support local business so now that I've moved back to the area I thought it would be fun to take my family. Wrong. While the food hasn't changed and is fine, the atmosphere isn't. Negative political bumper stickers made it instantly uncomfortable. We almost left before we even ordered. While many of my high school classmates faces are still on the tables and walls, the place didn't feel good to be in. We ate quickly outside and left. Won't be back. The sad thing is it has nothing to do with the food.

Went here after getting a mew puppy and our other vet moved out of state. The office is clean and the staff is friendly and good.  My puppy has had some problems and the Vets have done a great job trying to manage the food allergies and other issues.   I like that they have discount shot days. That has been very helpful with all of the puppy shots.

Love wings? Then this is the place for you on Tuesday and Thursday nights. Normally the wings are .69 but in these two days they are only .49! I also love that there are 15 different flavors and you can order as many of each as you like. So if you want to try just 3 of several kinds of wings you can. I go mainly for the wings but the appetizers are also great. Several friends and family have had several non-wing items and they have always enjoyed their choices. Enjoy!

Always fast service. They do an excellent job getting me back on the road after a flat. Even have free water while you wait.  I always get my car back in the time promised.

Great place to hang out and do some work or meet up with a few friends. I love the music they play. Really creates a nice atmosphere. I am not a coffee drinker but they provide so much more than coffee that anyone can find something they like.

I have been here many times and have always had a good experience. My favorite item on the menu is the Chipotle Chicken and Bacon salad. When I introduced a friend to this salad she immediately told her husband who said, "I've been getting it for years...it's the only thing I order anymore." I am not a big salad eater but I crave this salad and sometimes plan my work route so I can stop for lunch there.

I won't use anyone else. Jeremy was so helpful  explaining the process so we could prepare to buy a house at the right time for us. We felt no pressure. Then once we were ready he saw to every detail and made the process very easy. I highly recommend them.

We had to take our dog in with a serious injury that we ended up having to put the dog down for. However, while they did diagnose things correctly, I didn't feel we were sent home with great care instructions. We didn't understand what the possibilities of decline could have been or what we could have done at home more than the meds given. We ended up having to go to our very the next day to learn much more.

I was recently introduced to Z Pizza and now I can't get enough. I really enjoy the variety they offer but my favorite thing is the pesto sauce!  They rotate through different pizzas that you can get by the slice each day or you can order your favorite full size pizza.  My Kids live this pizza. My picky eater says it is the best pizza she has ever had.

Great place to bring the family. Went with my wife and our 6 yr old for breakfast. You know it is going to be good then they have "Mickey Cakes" on the kids menu. Any time the young ones are able to be kept happy with their meal is a good meal out.  My wife had the biscuits and gravy. Make sure you are HUNGRY if you get the large size. Way to much food for her but she loved them.  I had a basic meat (bacon) and eggs. Also came with potatoes and another side. I went with pancakes and the potato wedges. Yummy.  Price was right and we will be back for sure.

I really enjoy coming to Maizie's. It is very conveniently located right off the light rail.  My favorite item is the asparagus and shrimp pesto penne pasta. The pesto sauce is YUMMY! They also have great burgers and appetizers.   I have always found the staff to be friendly and quick.   With all the choices on central I definitely think Maizie's is one of my favorites.

Great place to hang out and spend several hours. There are a bunch of different areas that kids can loose them selves in. The museum is almost 100% interactive which makes for a very fun experience. My son, who is 5, loves the "tree house" structure on the 1st floor and the noodle forest on the 3rd floor. He loves to make multiple visits to each area.   I one draw back is my 10 year old feels she is too old for it. This makes it hard to get everyone excited about it being a family activity. Also, everyone is the same price and when the older child and the adult can't experience the activities that is an issue.

I went for the all you can eat sushi that was advertised on the banner. However, I ended up just having a lunch special since I felt the all you can eat deal was over priced.  While the food was fine I really felt like everything was overpriced.

Great way to get a good massage without needing an appointment. Feeling stressed or sore just head to the mall and get a quality chair or table massage.

Wow what a great find. I loved the atmosphere and the sushi was great. We had the Sake Bomber...hard to go wrong there. For a salad we split the crab sunomono. I would usually get a tako salad but wanted to try something different. I enjoyed it but would have liked a little more crab. I would probably try something else and not get that particular salad again. Not because it wasn't good just wasn't a favorite.  For sushi I went simple and got the Dragon roll. They were really creative with the presentation and it was delicious!  My wife got the Rising Sun roll. As soon as they set it down she commented on the fact that it smelled amazing. She is not adventurous in her eating and this roll was a little new for her. Her comment at the end, "That was the best roll I have ever had."  We will definitely be heading back.

Was looking for something new, came in and saw David and he was awesome. Was brutally honest about the cut I had (which I knew was bad) then took over. I've never had so many compliments on my hair than in the past month since the cut. With short hair I'm back already for a tune up and again had a great experience. Love it!

This is an amazing place for children to learn swim. Both of my kids have gone here. One graduated many years ago and the other is there now. He didn't take immediately to the lessons but through the patience and professionalism of the teachers there he is improving all the time. I highly recommend this facility for kids of any ability.

I love this place. First of they get social media and how to reward loyal customers. I know that doesn't tell you about the food but it does say something about how they care about customers and their willingness to listen. Let me give an example. Shortly after they opened I commented that I would like to have had a chicken option for a quesidilla they thanked me for my comment. Within a month there were chicken options on the menu. Now that could have been something in the works but asking for comments, reacting to my comment, and doing something went a long way.  On to the food. Love the burgers. All of the ingredients taste so fresh. I have brought a lot of people here to try it and that is something that is always commented on. Everyone says they can taste the freshness.  My other absolute must have are the chips and salsa. I love the salsa and can't get enough.  I have seen them continue to evolve from the beginning and really like everything they are doing. I highly recommend.

I highly recommend this company for any AV production need your company or nonprofit may have. They have worked with our nonprofit for large fundraising events as well as providing small items like a simple mic and sound system. Their professionalism stands out. They go above and beyond in their customer service and their equipment is top notch as well. I will be using them again and suggesting others do so as well.

We went for the happy hour that everyone raved about and missed it by 6 minutes. The times were not listed on the website so we were guessing. FYI, it's daily 3-5pm and 8-10pm. We ended up staying and everything was delicious. Our favorite was the Phoenix roll. Possibly one of the best rolls I have ever had. We also had the Fuji Mountain. It was very good. We spent way more than we had planned but it was worth the trip and we will be back.

We had a Groupon for this place so decided to give it a try. It was a great experience and we will be back. Lots of original rolls to choose from. The service was great and so was the atmosphere.   We had the Midwestern, Lobster, and Golden California Rolls. All were great but the Lobster Roll was amazing! Can't wait to go back and have it again plus try some of the other rolls!

I just went to this restaurant after it opened. The problem is not really with the food but with the atmosphere. The music was extremely loud. No one could talk to each other at our own table. Another issue was how they were serving the beer. They bought us a beer that had the top of the head a good half inch to inch below the top of the glass, This was consistent for all 3 of our beers. One person in our group mentioned this to the server that delivered them and we were told this was the proper way it was to be served. After we looked at all the other beers being brought out, they were all with the head at the top of the glass. We spoke to the manager about it when he came by to check on us and he said again that ours were served properly. We showed him all the other beers and he said, "Huh?" It would seem that a new place would be interested in feedback and try to take it in a little better than in a more confrontational way.  The food was good. The majority of us had wings. They had a ton of flavors which was nice. Unfortunately, you have to order a minimum of 6 of a flavor so it doesn't leave much opportunity for experimenting. I had the Caribbean Jerk and the Parmesan. They were good just not enough to really entice me to come back. There are some other places near by with great wings and we can actually talk to each other when we go.

I can't say enough good things about the care and compassion provided by the folks at Angel Veterinary Services. Our dog, Jesse, had a sudden injury that progressed pretty quickly and we had to make the decision to put her down. Because of the injury we didn't want to cause her further pain so chose not to move her and have someone come to us. It was truly the best thing. Dr. Alexis was great and explained everything and didn't rush. They showed so much compassion for both our family and Jesse. I highly recommend them.

Love this place. Their pizza is my family's favorite. They make adjustments for the kids (light sauce) and are great at customer service. We always order it for delivery and it is fast and delivered hot every time.
