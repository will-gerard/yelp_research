Jordan is the only person you should ever go to for eyebrows. I've gone to countless people at dozens of places and no one compares to her! Highly recommend!

Beautiful restaurant, but don't go on a holiday! I brought my family there for Easter. Waited 20 minutes until anyone even greeted our table. Waited another 10 for our drinks. They brought out our appetizers with our entrees because they forgot about the appetizers. It was then that we ordered a 2nd round of mimosas. They took another 20 minutes to get those. They gave us those mimosas for free, which was nice. However I expect a lot more from a restaurant like this. The food is good, but when I go to a place like this I am mostly paying for an experience and a standard that I expect to be upheld. I felt like our table was shoved in the corner and forgotten about. I was shocked! I expected better.

Car wash was fine but they spent about 15 minutes trying to up sell me. I told them I needed to be in and out in 25 min. It took an hour and 25 min to get my car washed and I missed my afternoon appointments with clients. Their poor service really negatively affected my day... Expect a very long wait!

I've gone to many other tanning salons and NO ONE compares to designer shades! They are by far the best in Scottsdale... And super friendly too! They apply the barrier cream for you, buff you afterwards for the perfect tan, and just spoil you in general! They seem to really care about their clients looking good, not just spraying as many girls as possible in as little time as possible like so many other salons. I recommend designer shades and no where else to anyone looking for a spray tan!

Best nutrition shop hands down! Not only do they possess great product knowledge but they also surpass expectations in customer service. They are more than willing to give you samples of products before you try them. They usually even throw in a free protein shaker. I once left a Tiffanys bracelet there while using their free in body machine... I assumed I lost it for good. When I came back 2 months later, they had my bracelet and remembered it was mine! They exceed expectations all around!

I did the monthly membership and should have stopped coming after my first tan. I hoped it would get better after she adjusted the colors and knew how my skin reacted but it only got worse with each time! I was completely orange in some spots and white in others. The tan was so uneven. Every person I saw for the next 3 days made comments about how it was the worst tan they'd ever seen and I should go back and scream at them. I never did... But thank god it's faded now! Talk about embarrassing!

Marcus is awesome! Very knowledgable. He really helped me with my plantar faciitis and a few sports injuries. Highly recommend. Front desk staff was very friendly and extremely accommodating.

Horrible service. Caught the servers talking badly about my group and me. Food was a 4 out of 10. Service was a 0 out of 10. Didn't know I'd pay $100 to be disrespected.

I wanted to like this place. Atmosphere is great, menu looks good and it's very close for me. The food just isn't good. I've been here 4 times and always tried different things and it's just not very good. Last time I went here, I was one of the only people in the restaurant, there were 6 people behind the counter and it took several minutes for any of them to even great me.

I saw Brett for hormonal issues involving PCOS, weight and acne. With his help, my quality of life has improved dramatically. He didn't just put me on medication and walk me out as most doctors do, he explained the medications in great detail and seemed to truly care about the well being of his patients. When I came to him, I was overweight, lethargic and struggled with embarrassing acne. I have lost over 20 lbs, am full of energy every day and have been able to stop wearing makeup all together. I highly recommend!

Copper blues in Phoenix is amazing. Tempe location has terrible service. It was 15 minutes before anyone even said hello or brought waters. Took another 20 minutes just to get our beers.. And they mixed up mine and my boyfriends order. We went with the intention of having several drinks each but it took so long to get any type of service that we couldn't order more rounds. Food was good, atmosphere is good but the service is just terrible.

Took 20 minutes to get our drinks. My date's entree was served 15 minutes before any other food. Took 45 minutes to get the rest of the food, after being asked twice what we ordered. Our appetizer was served after we finished the whole meal. While we were eating, a couple people at the table right next to us were smoking cigarettes. It definitely interfered with the taste of our food and was generally bothersome. In their defense, they were short staffed and apologetic. They comped our drinks from our bill, which was only equivalent to $7.00. OK food, bad service. Wouldn't recommend.
