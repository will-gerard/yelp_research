So exclusive you have to make an appointment, and even when you do, you're still stuck waiting. It's gotten too pretentious here. Go somewhere else.

This store is a 16th Street treasure! I happened upon the Hive when I was living and working in the area. Great art, great accessories and wonderful selection of clothes.  The owners have impeccable taste and are always helpful in putting together outfits.  I have found quite a few event outfits here, some still have the store tags on them! While you're in the area for lunch at La Condesa (which is just down the street), stop by the Bee's Knees and see what treasures they have to offer. You won't be sorry!

I went to The Bronze Bar the day before I had a pool party to attend, and for my first spray tan experience.  Of course I was nervous at first, but after meeting Laura, those nerves went away. The location is very clean, and Laura very professional, making the experience wonderful from the start.  The color is custom mixed specifically for you, so you won't end up with some streaky, orange tan and Laura is not afraid to give you her opinion on what she thinks will look best.  The process is designed to suit your comfort level and again, Laura puts you right at ease.   My color turned out BEAUTIFUL. Very natural looking and wears very well.  Although I work out avidly and shower frequently, I didn't find the color to fade too quickly or unevenly.  All in all, I am very pleased with my experience at Bronze Bar and will certainly go back in the future.

Where do I start? I am just starting out the second year of my lease, and highly regretting having renewed it in the first place.   I originally moved in December 2011, the unit I was told I was getting and shown, was not the unit I ended up with and when I received my keys I opened the door to an apartment that had not been cleaned after the last tenant.  The previous tenant had left trash, belongings, filth and even moldy food in the fridge.  Honestly, at that point I should have asked that they shredded my lease and looked elsewhere.  They took three days to clean the apartment that they had received a month's notice I would be moving in to, and about three weeks of constant phone calls for basic maintenance requests - leaky faucets, a non-functional oven, screwed up carpet, broken windows with no screens, non-functioning heat, eventually non-functioning cooling, and a refrigerator that wouldn't close tightly.  Many of those items to this day (January 2014) have not been addressed, and I am still constantly requesting maintenance work that never seems to get taken care of.    There have been several (four I think?) management company changes in the year that I have lived here, the most recent to Alliance Residential, which I thought would mean positive change as they are such a large company and perhaps had better financial backing and organization than the last few companies the property owner used.  Was I ever wrong! This newest management change has been by far the worst; I at least felt like the group immediately previous to them actually cared about the tenants and was reachable.  Alliance has simply replaced warm bodies in the office and on the maintenance staff, and the staff really treats this like their job - not our home.  Maintenance requests require angry emails in order to be addressed, sometimes my rent payment goes through their website and sometimes it doesn't - you can be sure though that I'll get hit with the late fees if it's not in by the first, the property is covered in animal feces from lazy dog owners and trash from the homeless people that seem to have free reign over the property, dogs running off leash and defecating on doorsteps, urinating all over the walkways with no one to clean it up, extraordinarily questionable neighbors who "take in homeless boys off the street', and are admittedly unemployed, drunk neighbors stumbling around the property on a regular basis (after coming home at 10am with their daily case of Milwaukee's Best), there is no security to speak of- even when complaints are made you are advised to make repeated police reports versus the management actually looking into constant issues, neighbors leave cat food everywhere to feed the feral cats that roam the neighborhood and are quickly multiplying because of this, and you'll be lucky to be able to use one of 2 washers and dryers for 25 units (and the homeless that come bathe in the sinks and use the units themselves). The units are hastily remodeled, so looking at them is nice, but living in them is another story.  At least one of the pools has not been properly cleaned since Alliance took over in July. There has been sediment in there since monsoon season.  Even the maintenance staff has gone as far as to say that the owner just doesn't want to put the money into his own property.  Sadly, that's obvious.  Overall, I would highly recommend against moving into this property.  I only signed my lease again, as I intend to move out of state in December 2014 so the thought of moving into a new address for only a year seemed too much. Again, regretting that decision. If you rely on the website as a guide, you may think you are moving into a trendy central Phoenix property with hip, clean neighbors and maybe getting a community of people you are excited to live near or even become friends with.  The reality is, this is quickly approaching Section 8 territory and the management doesn't necessarily care to change any of that.  What you are actually getting are many filthy, loud neighbors who care even less about where they live than the property managers do.

I have to say I wasn't horribly impressed here. I came all the way from Central Phoenix to try out Nekter's juices and instantly felt like I was an outsider. The girl at the counter was so completely unfriendly I wondered if she had somewhere better to be; she clearly didn't want to be there. I asked her what was good and she looked at me like I was an idiot and then offered no real help. When I decided on something I asked about adding protein, to which she again responded like I should just know that Nekter uses hemp protein although I didn't see it listed anywhere. I bought a $10 logo plastic cup with which I was supposed to get a free 16oz juice or smoothie, which didn't happen and when I called her on it she rolled her eyes. Since she had already rung me up, she told me to just tell them next time I come in that I didn't get it and they would honor it. Really? Although the smoothie I ordered was decent, it certainly didn't warrant the $20 price tag and the poor service. I'm thinking there probably won't be a next time.

Highly misinformed nutritional information. The menu reads like a list of the worst possible foods for your body, and the shakes don't contain actual whole ingredients. You know, like fruits and vegetables. They give you a 'weight loss tea' with your 'smoothie', both are made from a powder and (or) flavor syrups. I ordered the Orange Julius, which I thought might have some semblance of fruit flavor...it did not. The 'smoothie' was grainy, artificial tasting and unfulfilling. There is nothing in the Herbalife powder they use, that offers any real nutritional benefit. Just another method of hocking an ineffective product and furthering a well known MLM pyramid, which is almost as unsavory as the shakes/teas themselves. $7 for a junk, powdered shake that bloats you, doesn't even taste like real food and offers no real nutritional benefit? No thank you!!
