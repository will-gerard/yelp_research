Barro's is always awesome. When I call in an order its usually ready faster than they say it will be, and their meatball pizza is delicious.

This was the first company I called that didn't give me the runaround on scheduling. Very professional. They had someone out the next morning to snake a line, however the guy who came out got straight to work without giving me an estimate of the cost to do the work. Turns out what I thought was more convenient access through the ceiling (only about 8 ft of pipe to go through instead of closer to 20) was unusual conditions and was an extra $150 charge compared to going through the upstairs sinks and traveling through all the extra pipe. I wish he had said something about the cost beforehand. Overall good experience, just more expensive than I expected.

The store itself was great, however the service there was not. I know enough about technology to know when the people that are helping me are either lying to me, making things up on the spot, or were taught badly and just don't know any better. They now have product specialists for different brands, and if you ask them a question about a type of product they will direct you towards their brand only instead of giving you information on all of them so you can make an informed decision.  I would definitely buy from here again, but do your research before you walk in so you're not at the mercy of the employees.  PS. All HDMI cables are the same, don't let them sell you the most expensive one to "make your new tv look even better".

This place is phenomenal. I get the caniac and have them replace all the sides with more toast because the toast is just that good. Did I mention toast? If you just like toast you should go there, let alone getting awesome chicken and some Cane's sauce that you should save for the toast.  Toast.
