Um.  No.    I can't bring myself to give any more than one star:  It had air conditioning and chairs to sit on.  The chairs didn't break when we sat on them.  The air conditioning worked.    Wait staff was absolutely horrible (made us wait very long time before we even got menus, then got distracted when it came time to pay the check).    I swear this kitchen belongs on kitchen nightmares.  The salad was downright scary (I didn't eat it because I didn't want to get sick), the water glasses had COFFEE STAINS ON THEM (how does that even happen?!), and what edible food there was was simply average.  Manager solicited our feedback then CUT US OFF after we got 3 words out.  (Us: "Well, we kinda ... " Him (interrupting): "Thank you for your business")  Yeah.  If you see this place, don't walk -- RUN to a different restaurant.

I saw Heart here with my wife on 7/26/07.   It was our first concert here -- and we had a blast.    Even pushing 60, Heart puts on a great show.  The 'theater in the round' concept made it all the more awesome.    There are a few things I wish somebody had told me ahead of time, so I'm going to share them with you now:  Money: Plan on having cash on hand for parking, concessions, etc.  Tickets can be picked up / purchased from the box office with a credit card.  Parking: Parking at the theater is $5.  Cash.  Get there an hour ahead of time to get a good spot.  Pull through in the parking spot so that you can put your car in 'drive' when exiting the spot.  Choose a spot that is well lit if you're going to an evening event -- you're not in the greatest part of Phoenix.  Food: I'm not sure if it's entirely obvious from the 'show nearby businesses' in Yelp, but there are NO RESTURANTS nearby.  When you get down there, it will be fairly obvious why -- you're in an industrial part of town.  Plan on eating ahead of time, or bringing your dinner with you.    Gear: The theater doesn't let you bring backpacks in, but will let you bring a purse in.  (I personally think it's a double standard).  I was a little disappointed that I had to pack my backpack in the trunk -- I would have left it at home.    Seating: I'm a big guy -- about 6'4" -- and the seating IS NOT FRIENDLY TO LARGE PEOPLE.  At all.  Seriously.   I literally could not fit into my seat -- my legs would not fit.  Luckily I talked with an usher, who directed me to a red-shirted supervisor, who made a spot for my wife and I in the handicapped section.  The people who made this accommodation for me were very friendly about it.  I was told that in the future, I should actually instruct the box office to give me tickets in this section, or in the front row of the rear section (there is only a bar in this row -- so it would be more friendly to my legs).  Food at the venue: They have a full bar with premium brands, Coke, wine, Budweiser, Bud Light and many imported beers. Also, pizza, hot dogs, popcorn and other snacks are also available before and during shows.  So if the line is long before the show (and you can stand stepping out quickly during part of the event) you'll get a MUCH shorter line during the show.  You might even get no line (like I did).  What I liked best: The best part about this place is its intimate setting.  I know people have mentioned that before -- but it really can't be overstated.  You might have seen an act before -- but not 40ft away on a rotating stage.    This place will definitely give you a night to remember.

Quite possibly the most exquisite gastronomical delight you will ever partake in.   My wife and I went here for our anniversary, and it was our best.    I highly recommend you call ahead and be very clear if you are planning on dining to celebrate a special occassion (particularly one that has to do with romance).  I did, and I'm glad of it.  This place is the cat's meow.    I highly recommend the duck.  The staff actually took it upon themselves to wish us a happy anniversary (and actually wrote it on our dessert plates!), and even took (and gave us) a souvenir picture to remember the evening.    Ambience and service is amazing.

I don't think I would be rating this place so poorly if it didn't seem like such a letdown.  This place really does look very nice from the outside.  The fountains are a nice touch.    But the bugs really are too much.    Let me also say that I'm an Arizona native.  I'm not particularly squeamish about bugs, because c'mon ... they're like all over the place in the desert.    After our eleventy-fifth ant infestation (nothing like enjoying a nice night of TV and seeing an ant -- or five -- crawling up your arm!), and after seeing our 10th gigantic cockroach, and after hearing other residents complain about scorpions ... scorpions ... I think I'm ready to start looking elsewhere.    I would advise you do the same.    This place is a lot closer to 7th street than you might imagine, and it really belongs in Sunnyslope -- not Phoenix, like the address suggests.

Clean, classy, and like a blast from the past.    I have fond memories of visiting a See's Candy store as a kid -- smelling the fresh chocolate and letting my gaze wander over the amazing selection of chocolates.    Not much has changed in 20-30 years.    And to be honest, I think that's a good thing.    The showroom might seem sterile and, well ...  'white'.  (Almost like a really clean and spacious bathroom).    But be sure to ask for whatever samples they might have available -- they won't even make you buy anything (but I dare you to walk out without giving some of your money to those nice old ladies that work behind the counter).  I've taken my two daughters there (11 and 8) and they keep asking me when we're going to go back.  The staff at See's Candy's really seem to know how to treat kids nicely.  I'd give this place 5 stars, but their prices are a bit high.  You do get a quality product, but you definitely pay for it.

Solid old school Barbershop.  I've been to several barbershops on this side of town trying to find a good one.  I think I've finally found my new barber.    Solid ambience, skilled and friendly barbers (who aren't afraid to strike up a conversation with you!), and a convenient location.    Tip: I went in the morning (before 10am), and the hustle and bustle of Kierland hadn't started yet.

Oh, Bicycle Ranch -- where should I begin?  I'll start with the facts.   4 days ago:  After a few weeks of research and saving my money, I bought a new bike to commute to work.    1 day ago, I took new bike to this place because it came highly reviewed, it was close, and I was having issues with my rear derailleur when commuting.  Taking my bike to the mechanics there results in an immediate insult to my choice of bike ("Schwinn just doesn't make bikes like they used to").    I decide this might be some passing snobbery or a knee-jerk reaction to bikes not purchased there.  If they do a good job I suppose it's excusable.    I decide to leave the bike there.  The mechanic says I can pick it up around 5:00pm or so.    Halfway through the day, I get a phone call from the mechanic.  He says the tension pulley is defective and suggests I take my new bike back to the store.  A few minutes later he calls me again to tell me the problem is 'fixed, but he wants me to keep an eye on it -- and I can come pick it up' (is this so he can actually charge me some money?).  I pick it up, get insulted one more time ("Where did you buy this bike?  Toy-R-Us?"), pay $40, walk out, and I'm immediately able to reproduce the same problem.    In (previous reviewer) Sarah's defense: It appears that ownership of this store changed in August 2008.  This is clearly posted at the entrance to the repair shop in the rear of the store.  Whatever awesome sauce this place had previously has been replaced by epic failure.  Now for the review part: Clearly, you have rehearsed your insults, Bicycle Ranch.  They were brief, to the point, and delivered with a polished arrogance.  You get a star for this.    Catering to the super-rich set in Scottsdale is brilliant.  Positioning your store directly to the left of a 'Target' seems like an odd choice of location though.  -1 star.  Your service needs a bit of help.  $40 for some wonderfully delivered insults is one thing, but $40 for some insults + a bike that still has the same problems as when I brought it in is just sloppy.  -2 stars.  Not having any bikes in the store that I would be interested in (or could purchase for under $500):  -1 star.  End result:  Fail.   Verdict?  Patronize one of the 4 other bike shops within a half mile of this place.  You'll get better service, much fewer insults, and at a fraction of the cost.  The new ownership of this place needs to shape up or leave.

In the shade in the morning.   Great outdoor seating area.   Friendly regulars.  Good coffee.  Fresh pastries (in the morning).     All in all, it's a nice version of a chain coffee store.    The line will be out-the-door long in the morning until about 10:00am or so, but don't let that scare you:  They work through the line quickly.     This is the favorite Starbucks of several of my friends in the area -- and considering they have about 5 to choose from in a mile vicinity, that should say a lot.

Pssst.  Don't let the other reviewers trick you into thinking that this place is famous for it's deep-dish pizza.  It's not.  (Well, maybe it is).  But there are few things I look forward to more than a nice slice of thin crust Oreganos.    You can't miss their billboards or t-shirts around town.  If you're within 5 miles of Tempe, and you haven't checked this place out, go now.    No.  Seriously.  Go.  And if it's not too hot, sit outside.  The ambiance can't be beat.

For vegetarian fare, these guys are tops in my books.    I've always wanted to eat vegetarian because I knew it was healthy, but every vegetarian place I've been to (or every vegetarian recipe I've cooked, for that matter) has been very ... un-delicious.    Green is one of the few places in the valley that I would jump at the chance to eat at with a friend.  I've had their Kung Pao with mock chicken and it rivaled well known Kung Pao with real ACTUAL chicken.  It was quite satisfying  It's decor is neo-hippie-weird -- but don't let that scare you.  It works with this place.   And don't forget to ask about, save room for, and try a Tsoynami (a frozen ice-cream-blizzard-like treat).

Sorely disappointed.    I used to be a fan, but this barely half-full(at high noon on a Monday!) restaurant just doesn't cut it anymore.   Wait staff was sub-par, food was average, and the prices still conveyed the idea that the management thought they were awesome.  Parking is a royal pain in the butt -- and has clearly had an effect on other nearby businesses.  (This part is no fault of Uno's as far as I know).  If given a choice for a tasty business lunch, look elsewhere.

I'm not one to give stars lightly.    I was first introduced to Chino Bandido (or 'Chinos', as it's affectionately called by its regulars) by some friends of ours.  It was explained to me that it was a cross between Chinese food and Mexican food.    I'm sure you might be saying 'Huh?' right about now.  Trust me on this one.  They have the most amazing burritos, quesadillas, and beans.  They have anywhere from very mild (teriyaki chicken) to really spicy (cuban black beans).  They have amazing fried rice and carnitas.    It all comes together in what can only be described as an addicting concoction.  My stomach is grumbling as I write this ... just at the thought of this place.  They actually have die-hard regulars that have written poems and music about their food.  (Poems and music!)  Don't come here for the ambiance.  It's a hole in the wall.  Don't let that scare you.  Walk right up to the counter, tell them that you've never been there before, and prepare yourself to be taken on a tour of the food.    Seriously -- they'll give you samples so you know what you like!  No, I'm not joking.  They have quite a lunch crowd during the week.  (For some reason, engineers just flock to this place).  Come either around 11:00 or after 1:00 to beat the lunch crowd.

Simply fabulous.    Showed up on a Monday night (of all times) and this place was hopping.  As in packed.  As in - the only seats were outside.    I was pleasantly surprised with attentive wait staff, inexpensive prices, and absolutely amazing food.    Had the hummus, the Falafel Pita, and some Baklava.  I highly recommend it all.  You definitely have a new fan.

The food was OK.    Buffet style.   What really left a bad taste in my mouth was a.) Having my complete credit card number left on the receipt b.) Getting hit with a $100 phone call charge to my credit card.  When I called my bank to investigate, it turns out somebody had charged a $100 phone call from London to INDIA on my credit card.   c.) It turns out it was somebody from this restaurant.    Stay away from this shady place.  There are plenty of other honest Indian food businesses in the metro Phoenix area.

This place is just kind of sad.  It's a place that wants to be a hipster-cool-kid kind of hotel, but ... isn't.  It's not retro -- it's just old.  It's not chic, it's just tasteless.  Parking ========= One of the first things you'll notice about this hotel is that it's on a small lot.  So small that it doesn't actually have a place to pull up in front of the hotel and check in (like many traditional hotels do now).  I'm sure hipsters would call this 'charming'.  I call this 'thoughtless'.  Lobby ========= The lobby is spartan.  It shares an entryway/hallway with the very popular 'Gallo Blanco' restaurant.   On a busy night, you'll be toting your luggage in or out of the hotel past folks waiting to get into the restaurant.    Rooms ========= Many rooms open directly outside.  Think 'dressed up' Motel-6.  This is not a 4 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination, and simply saying it over and over again (like their website does) doesn't make it so.  Walls are paper thin.  Music plays almost constantly from the pool area.  Our shower didn't work (at all) for us -- we had to call maintenance to come look at it. Our room had a badly pixelated screen cap from the movie 'Tombstone' as 'artwork'.   If you came for a romantic getaway, you picked the wrong motel.  Spa ========= Non existent.  This is false advertising on the part of the hotel -- they advertise as a spa, even though the website clearly states it will be 'opening in may'.  When they do finally open, don't get your hopes up, it looks like they will only be offering a few types of massage, tea, and spray tanning(!?)  Room service ========= Non existent.  Again, this is apparently a four star hotel.  They will (for a $20/day fee, of course) provide all the wifi, soda and 'snacks' (think 100-calorie packs) that you would care to ask for from the front desk.  Since I booked through Expedia, this was included in my hotel stay.  Stay classy, Clarendon.  Summary ========= Stay away.  There are many other (actual) 4 star hotels in the Phoenix area.

Good Italian food run by (what looks like) the mob.  If it's not the mob, it's some good fellas, if you know what I mean.    I can personally vouch for their Chicken Parmesan, and their Sausage rolls.    Good service.    And friendly if you don't rat them out to the FBI.  Otherwise, you sleep with the fishes.

This is our regular movie theater hangout.  It's a chain cinema, but with a few perks:  The theater is new and fairly big, and attached to Desert Ridge.  This is probably one of the cleanest theaters in town, with very friendly staff.  I've actually gotten free nachos here, just by asking!  (Twice!)  (See http://www.danesparza.us/2006/06/26/nacho-surreality/ )  I really like the automated ticket systems, located just outside and just inside this theater.  When there is a long line waiting to purchase tickets outside, just go inside -- most people don't seem to remember there is a set of automated ticket purchasers inside, as well.  The only reason why I don't give this theater 5 stars is because of the ticket and concession prices.  I expect a theater to give good value.  You will get good service for your money, just expect to pay for it.    Depending on what you like to get, 2 tickets and some concessions can run close to $30.  And if you don't like a movie, feel free to ask for your money back.  When I have had the rare occasion to ask for a refund, the staff have always been courteous and prompt in giving one.  Tips for this theater:  Because it's attached to Desert Ridge, dinner and a movie can be separated by only a short walk.  If it's winter and you've got time to kill before a movie, get a hot cup of deliciousness at the nearby Starbucks, and plant yourself by the fireplace in front of the AMC.

Excellent fresh food.  If you're a fan of both meat AND veggies, you'll probably like this place.  Exquisite veggie spring rolls (they're not fried).  Excellent main dishes.  Legendary Pho.  (Pho is a Vietnamese soup, it's not like 'Funky mo-pho')

Great customer service and a good selection of mid-range bikes in the store make this a great bike shop.  Compared to other bike shops in the area this one is solid.  Bought a bike from this guys and before buying they let me ride several bikes on the road behind their shop (encouraged me to, actually).  Very low pressure sales.  They took time to understand what I wanted in a bike (including price range) and consistently showed me several bikes that met that criteria.  Very pleased with the whole experience.

I was driving with my wife about 2 weeks ago when the front end of my Suburban began to squeak as I drove.  A sense of dread overcame me as I realized that the squeak didn't go away, and as the week progressed -- the squeak got worse.  It eventually turned into the dreaded 'brake grind noise' when I would apply the brakes.  (It's kinda like that sound of screeching nails on a chalkboard but worse -- it involves you not being able to stop a large object quickly, too).  I'm not a mechanic by any stretch of the imagination, but I was pretty sure at least one side of my front braking system was hosed to the point of needing a new brake rotor.   I discussed the situation with my significant other and I decided I would try doing something that I was totally uncomfortable with (because I had never done it before):  I was going to actually try getting estimates from at least 3 different shops and see which was the best shop to do the repair.  In the end, I got estimates from 4 shops.  After getting the first shop to let me come join in the initial inspection of the brakes, I knew exactly what repairs needed to be done, and what the first shop was going to charge me for them.  I then thanked them, and let them know I'd be pricing this around -- "so put the wheels back on and I'll be on my way."   It was uncomfortable, but in addition to giving me excellent 'Yelp fodder', it turned out to be a great decision financially.    The shop that I finally decided to go with was 'Sun Devil Auto', on Frank Lloyd Wright.    Here's why.  Friendliness / honesty: One of the things that struck me about this shop was how friendly they were right off the bat.  I explained that I'd like an estimate, and they were totally OK with spending a little time putting together a nice quote.   Not only that -- they were proactive in discounting the labor costs for me.  Each visit was very friendly, and they recognized me after the first visit.    They were also proactive in saving the parts they removed and discussing them with me after the repairs.  As a guy who sometimes does his own repairs on my truck, I can't tell you how much street cred they got from me with this kind of honesty and willingness to share information.    Update 4/3/2008:  I actually got a follow-up call from Sun Devil Auto to a.) See how my brakes were doing, and check on the quality of the work and b.) Thank me for my business.    The call came roughly a  week after the work was done.  Attention to detail: Not only did they completely inspect the brake system (which is originally why I brought in the Suburban in the first place) but they also pointed out specific issues with my steering and an issue with my rear axle that I was not aware of.    I want to make it clear that these were not high pressure 'upsells'.  The mechanic that I worked with pointed out that these weren't safety issues -- and also pointed out that he didn't think I needed to repair these issues yet, but that it would be wise to save up for them.  Price: Considering the cleanliness of the shop, the amount of repair work done, how quickly the repairs were done, and how thorough they seemed to be in their work, it continues to amaze me that they were so inexpensive.  They turned out to be the 2nd lowest bid (but were almost the lowest).    Here is a breakdown of parts / labor and my costs:  Front disk brakes shoes / pads Rear drum brakes shoes / pads 2 new rear drums 2 new rotors for the front 2 new front calipers for the front All labor and taxes Total cost: $789  Every other shop I talked to wanted to charge me more money for equivalent (or sometimes less!) parts and labor.  Quality of workmanship: So far, I can say that my truck brakes MUCH better now that the repairs have been completed.  No squeaks, no rattles, no unusual braking patterns.    Waiting room experience: Their waiting room is everything that you'd like in a waiting room:  Roomy, clean, quiet, cool (it's Arizona, after all) and with a TV, restroom and drinking water.  Why is this formula so hard to reproduce in other car shops?  It's rare to find a shop that has all of these items.  Summary: I would highly recommend this auto shop for basic repairs.  They seem inexpensive, efficient, and friendly.  The ways they could possibly improve their service?   Provide more free alternatives for food and drink (half a star) and provide an inexpensive or free shuttle for customers dropping off their vehicles (half a star).    On the basics of what an auto shop should be (and even a bit more) -- these guys are hitting on all six cylinders.

I'm a fan of Chick-fl-a.  They're good (better than McDonalds), cheap, and friendly.  Be sure to tell them 'thank you' at the end of an order.  I'm willing to bet they'll answer with a friendly, "My pleasure".  (Try to see what happens at the McDonalds up the street if you try this!)  If you dine inside at this location, they have an enclosed play area for the kids.    If you come for lunch at this location come before 11:00am or after 1:00pm -- ESPECIALLY if you plan on using the drive through.  They have quite a congestion problem in the drive-through at lunch.

Pleasantly surprised by Bogi, Louie and her shop today.    I was having some problems getting my car started and not only did Bogi ask me if I wanted to come out into the shop to see what she had found, but she was friendly and informative.    Normally I have to ask to be shown things in other shops, and I feel like I'm really asking for a lot when I do this.  Turned out it was a loose battery connector and no charge to me.  (I'm a dork)  I dig honest, prompt, and courteous service -- so I'll definitely be back with more automotive service requests in the future.

Perhaps it's because I've gotten better at cooking my own food.  Perhaps it's because I've been to the Gordon Biersch in Tempe, and I had fond memories of it.  Either way, I really didn't like the food I just had there.   SERVICE ======== Attentive & prompt.  Not maître d' service, but not slophouse, either.  Just good, old fashioned, "let me keep your glass full and make sure you don't want anything else" service.  BEER ====== Reasonable, but if this place is a brewery they really should have more involvement with the beer.  Pair beers to food.  Have more than one beer that constantly gets put into recipes.  (They really keep bangin on that 'marzen' beer in recipes -- why not be a little creative?).  Hell -- maybe even have free mini beer tasters.  But I digress.  FOOD ======= I hope you didn't come here for the food, because it's pretty bland.  -1 star for the food, big time.  I ordered the crab & lobster cakes, and it was a mistake.  Bland cakes, tiny dish of tartar sauce and large mound of (plain!) white rice on the plate?  WTF!   I ordered the triple chocolcate brownie for dessert, thinking that it was hard to screw that up, but (freeze dried?) brownie just doesn't cut it, folks.  -1 star again (and a pile of disappointment) for screwing up the brownie.  PRICE ====== Where this place is truly in a universe of its own is price.  Those blandcakes I had?  $25!   $15 for meatloaf?  Really!?? -1 star for snooty  Scottsdale prices without the snooty Scottsdale food.  All in all, a sub-par experience at a champagne price.  Skip it.  You're not missing much.

Damnit Scratch.  I wanted to like you.  I really did.    Overall: Here's the deal:  My daughter and I do 'daddy/daughter' once a month or so.  We decided to go see a movie and then hit this place for lunch on Saturday.  I'm sure this place is doing something right (or perhaps Yelp is doing something right on their behalf?) because this place was hopping.  As in: packed.  As in:  no seats available.    So we decide to do takeout.  We ordered 2 sandwiches (they each come with side salad greens) and 2 desserts.  And we waited outside on their patio set for our order to be done.  Location:   VERY hard to spot for a few reasons:   a.) It's in a strip mall b.) The signage is HIDDEN BY A SUN-SHADE.  As other reviewers have pointed out, It's nestled between a Subway and some other insignificant strip-mall business. Look for the subway if you're trying to find it.  Ambiance Cute in a neo-french sort of way.  Pastry case where you order, small indoor seating area and communal table, and a bit of outdoor seating that's probably only comfortable to use about 2 months out of the year here in Arizona.  (Did you know that it got uncomfortably hot outside here in Arizona?  Who knew?)  Campy french music playing when we were there.  Menu selection Here's where it gets really interesting.  Their pastries look delicious.  To be honest, it was hard to pick just a few things to try.  Their sandwiches sound incredible, and these were hard to choose as well.  I settled on a Croque Monsieur and an almond tart.  The part that is heartbreaking for a first-timer here is possibly spending a small fortune on something that isn't at all what you expected.    Price Here's my main sticking point with Scratch Pastries.  This place is EXTREMELY expensive for what you get.  Our sandwiches were above average in both uniqueness and quality, but not 200% better than subway, next door (and that's about what we paid).  The pastries were the main event, both in presentation & price.  Again:  They were good, but not $5+ good (and that's what we paid for them.  Per pastry)  Summary: Pretty cute.  Very francophile.  Interesting menu.  Very expensive.  Probably won't be back for a while.

Overall: Cute mom & pop operation buried in the airpark.  I ended up not even looking at the menu and simply ordering one of the 'lunch specials of the day'.  Location:   Safe neighborhood, but this place is hard to spot amongst all the other small businesses there.  Understand that this place is north of Redfield.  Ordering: Typical 'order at the counter' style.  Limited beverage supply in fountain form.  Decent beverage supply in an easily accessible fridge.  Also:  Pickles are the only things that come with a sandwich.  "No chips.  Only pickle." They have a sign to this effect (in large letters) next to the chips.    Pricing: A bit on the expensive side for the quantity of food given.  I paid $18 and change for 2 decent-sized sandwiches, 2 chips and 2 drinks.  You're paying for a bit of small-town ambiance, the charm and service of the folks behind the counter, and the quality of the food and preparation.    And what about the ambiance? This isn't Starbucks:  You won't be referred to as your drink order, or expected to 'come pick it up yourself'.  Expect to get into a conversation with the folks that work there.  In the end, it's a cute place that I plan on revisiting (especially on pirogi Wednesdays).  The frequency of my visits will only be limited by my budget.

I never thought I'd be reviewing a moving company, much less giving it a positive review -- but here I am.  I'm guessing I'm going to see pigs fly in the next day or two.    I had a very pleasant experience with these movers.  They are professional, courteous, prompt, and hard working.    I used this company to move my family from our Phoenix apartment to our new home in Scottsdale this past week.  They stick to their rates, they don't nickle and dime you, and (for me at least) they actually came within 15 minutes of their original estimate. I highly recommend them.

Absolutely horrendous.  This post office will lose your mail (repeatedly), laugh about it to your face, lie about it, blow it off, make it seem like it's your fault and make you wish you had sent it UPS.

My wife and I visited Robyn about a month ago and got solid, no nonsense tax advice from a very knowledgeable CPA.    If you have ANY questions about Federal or State taxes, Robyn is the CPA you should be going to.  Not only is she knowledgeable, but she's willing to take the time to help you understand the advantages of various parts of the tax code.  (She actually thinks taxes are kinda fun! How weird is that?)  I'll definitely be using her as a counselor to my family and small business in the future.

This place is phenomenal. I would only be adding to a long list of gushing reviews, so I'll be brief.   When you go (and you're planning on going -- right?) ask about the food. So much of what they serve isn't store-bought. It's hand crafted. That toast you get? On fresh baked bread. The bacon? From a special local butcher. The jam to spread on your toast? Homemade. And delicious.   Service with a smile.   Great new (larger) digs.   Go early. This place is POPULAR for a reason.
