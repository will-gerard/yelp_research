Another satisfied customer! I was referred to Techniprint about a year ago for a project I wanted to put on canvas and they did wonderful then and now they outshined once more. Blew up 3 prints that I had them scan 2-3 times the original size & print on canvas. They came out absolutely perfect! They look so good that the framers at Michael's asked me where I got them done so here's a referral Techniprint!

When I want to pay an insane amount of money for some high-quality gear, this is my jam.  I can't help but say hello and chitchat with all the beautiful women at the make-up counters. They are all so pleasant and eager to help me. Especially the tall Serbian woman at the Chanel counter. She always has my favorite lotions, colognes and perfumes in stock. Can't help but stop by Trish McEvoy and grab my favorite super expensive Chapstick. I guess they call it lip balm but you should really try it.

1 star for the exceptional service & extra slow food preperation.  2 stars for the extra greasy pizza  I purchased a groupon for this place and finally got around to using it. I wasn't in a hurry to use it even tho it had an expiration date because I called, spoke to somebody & they ensured me it wouldn't expire.   Walked into this place and had a hard time choosing the least dirty booth/table but finally made my choice and wiped off the left overs crumbs left on the table and seats. I guess with only 1 waitress it's hard to take care of a couple tables so we had to wait a good 15-20 for a greeting. No big deal..... It just meant we had plenty of time to second guess our ordering decisions. Which was a good thing because they were out of this & out of that on an early Saturday night. Really?? We ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and it took over an hour for them to prepare and deliver it to our table. There was enough grease on this pizza to save the govt millions in vehicle maintenance but since I'm not in the habit of bailing out the fat cats I quickly used an entire trees worth of napkins to solve the issue. A little grated cheese, stale crushed peppers, garlic salt and voialla & edible pizza. The pizza actually has good flavor and I enjoyed the crust which normally I don't. I didn't want to chance my luck with letting down my taste buds so we opted out on the potentially fake Italian desert.   So here's where Bouno's helped establish their excellent one star review with me. The waitress brought the bill & I gave here my groupon. She quickly made an excuse on not taking the groupon because it was expired & I showed her on the groupon where it says it NEVER EXPIRES so she took it to her boss. A $12 dollar groupon discount turned into a $6 discount. Nothing makes me more sadder than a business not living up to their offer. Don't put it out there if you have no honor. Well, to wrap this up I'm gonna say good by to Bouno's & wish them luck cuz they're gonna need it if they plan on staying in business with such awesomeness.

As George clooney said in O Brother Where Art Tho.....a geographical oddity, 2 weeks from everywhere. I don't know if it was just our list but the things we were shopping for (hamburger, buns, etc....) where not readily available. Crazy strange huh......oh well, we improvised

I was in the area so I tried out royal cleaners. A bit pricey I think.....the 2 out of 3 pairs of shorts I had them repair (buttons) have came off again. Being that they weren't cheap I expected a much better job

For a fast food joint I find whataburger to be more appealing than the rest. What really sucks though is no matter how much you spend on a meal, when they come by with your meal and the condiments don't ask for ranch or bbq sauce because it's extra. This petty nickel and diming is a real big turnoff and that definitely deters me from eating here.   This location is easy to access and has a drive-through, which I think most of them do but I figure not everyone reading these reviews have been to whataburger so here you go.....  Burgers are good and whataburger likes to emphasize on the fact that there are thousand and one possibilities for making a custom burger. Whatever your bag is, they can make it. The fries are pretty decent, sometimes they're a bit more saltier than I like but they are good. The pies are yummy! And of course last but not least, my favorite is the honey barbecue chicken strip sandwich on Texas toast. Delish!!!! I don't stop at this establishment a lot, primarily because they don't have a lot of locations but when I do that chicken strip sandwich is my jam!   Just a side note, is it just me or has anyone noticed that whataburger seems to hire people on the low end of the spectrum to work here. I get the whole minimum-wage thing but sometimes I really question the mental stability of the person taking my order. Not trying to be mean or unheartful (I made that word up) but sometimes I feel like someone's a sandwich short of a picnic if you know what I mean. Hats off to them though, because even though I feel their employees are somewhat questionable, mainly appearance- they have never messed up an order. I guess being the food connoisseur (aka food snob) that I am I probably have my standard set a bit too high when I walk into a fast food chain. Hopefully you enjoy and find my review useful as I work on my foot to mouth issue

I enjoy trinket shopping so coming here is always fun for me. Summer time is a little unbearable as the day heats up so come here early! During the winter tho its great. the spots fill up with vendors & you'll find the occasional car show on the west side of the market. Great for little gifts at a reasonable rates. I've come here plenty in my years & I will continue to come here, just not as much in the summer-too hot for me

Can't say that I've ever really had an excellent experience with this company. They are definitely a three-star company. Their prices are a little high. Guys behind the counter typically pretty nice though. Anytime I've had to return something or get something under warranty never quite works out as painless as it should. When you're in a pinch though and you need something quick you have to do what you have to do.

There's this magical place that makes me feels like I'm home every time I get off the plane. You guessed it - that's Hawaii!! If you haven't been there, get there. My suggestion eat here first to give you a true taste of Hawaii.   So this location is one of those hidden gems. Tucked away in a strip mall off a busy street that doesn't really have the exposure it deserves. Nevertheless as soon as you pop your head through the front door you're greeted by a true Hawaiian. Now your gonna ask yourself what's a true Hawaiian and I'm going to tell you. A warm greeting as you step into the door and that sense of familiarity, like your part of the family. The owner is a sweetheart and she definitely brings the joy of the islands with her to work. Full of laughs and happiness. So walk up to the counter, look up to the left to see the specials and grab a menu. You want another true tell sign that this place is legit? Snag a musubi from the basket on the counter. For those of you who don't know what that is, the best way to describe it is - it's a Spam burger. A piece of spam nestled in between 2 buns made of rice gift wrapped in seaweed. don't knock it until you try it this is a delicacy! I chose one of the plate specials and so did my amigo. We both grab the teriyaki chicken and coconut shrimp plate. Macaroni was the side and it was delectable. The shrimp were perfect-just the right amount of coconut with a side of dipping sauce. Same with the teriyaki chicken-not too sweet not to teriyaki. The rice balls had a nice glaze over them as well. Now I'm not a big fan of macaroni salad but I tore this one up.   My plate was stacked high with food    pricing was great   The taste was authentic and right on the money  I think we call that a trifecta. If you can't make it over to the island anytime soon at least make it over here to get a taste of what you're missing.

Ash, the property manager, is a sweetheart! The pricing for what you get is better than anywhere else in town. Times of usage aren't the best but its doable. Mon-Fri 9-6/ Sat 9-5. they also give 1/2 off your first three months.

One of my favorite places for breakfast! Today wasn't a good day though for my server. She messed up mine and my cousin's meals but she made up for by comping our meals as well as our black berry bread pudding appetizer I love so much. Even with this little catastrophe I will always continue to be a patron! Love this place!

Last video store in town. At least it's the only 1 I know of.... Been coming here for years. Great selection of old & new movies. There is an adult section is there-completely segregated from the normal section. I'm glad cause I don't wanna explain that stuff to my kid quite yet. All around great store! Everyone that works there is super helpful & knowledgeable.

This place is my jam! I've been coming here a while.... I've always gotten good quality food & my crazy orders always come out right. The horchata here is my fav-not too much cinnamon. The quantity is always plenty. I've realized I get a lot more here for my $$$ then I do at other locations... I'll continue to make a guest appearance here from time to time. no autographs tho.... well, some exceptions can be made

Let me say I can sometimes find myself being guilty of judging a book by its cover. In the case of Mucho Taco I quickly overlooked it due to location, location, location. Good thing my little girl is as adamant as I am when it comes to satisfying whats on the taste buds. I did a quick Yelp review look up and was pleasantly surprised by the overall reviews for this joint. Well, I'm not afraid of broadening my horizons. This place has a quaint old town Mexico feel to it. They even have Telemundo on the tele. What really caught my attention is the fact that this place was clean, not a dirty table in the joint. That can really set the mood and so far I'm smiling.   Walked up and the girl working the counter was all smiles and quite frankly had the best attitude/customer service I've seen in a long time. You've got to take a moment to recognize and appreciate such things when you see it.  Lucky for me today's especial was a 2 taco plate with rice & beans. Just what my daughter loves. I gave her my American child's request for this and that added and removed and she accommodated with no fuss. Then it was time for the General to make an off the menu request. I wanted a chimichanga but I was feeling chorizo so how about combining the 2. No problemo here! The girl picked up the menu and explained with a picture how they make their chimmi's enchilada style and asked if that would be ok. Absolutely! Paid, the girl and found me a nice place to rest my dogs. A couple seconds after getting situated the young lady brought out chips and salsa. Now being a connoisseur of all things food I was up for the salsa challenge. Gotta say- this salsa is good! Thick, not runny & it had a pleasant little kick to it. Too bad food was ready so quickly because I wanted to beat down another helping. Taco's looked delicious and their was plenty of rice & beans, my little girl's order was perfect. Im regretting not posting a pic of my chimmi masterpiece. Presentation was wonderful! A good sized chimmi laid smothered in cheese and surrounded in red sauce. Could have used a little more sour cream & guac but I know this stuff is so rare around AZ that restaurants share it sparingly. now I'm being sarcastic! But all in all the flavor was delish!   I'm so glad I have a Mexican restaurant to add to my list of happiness. This place will be getting a return visit from me and anyone else I can con into the ghetto. lol Keep an eye out amigo's because after a couple more visits to ensure I wasn't dreaming, I'll be moving my rating up a notch. This place is great!

Another great yelp find! Greated with smiles & bottles of water. I treated me & my daughter with a manicure & pedicure. I didn't feel rushed even though they had people waiting. I felt like I got my money's worth! They did a wonderful job on my little girls nails. Best way to spend sum daddy daughter time if you ask me. And the bill..... Was about $20 less than what I typically have paid. I will definitely recommend this place as well as be back for some routine maintenance

I'm definitely an Apple fan! Thats all I have. In order for Apple to get 5 Stars it would take them offering better prices for their products & services. I understand everyone's gotta make money but dang they charge a lot sometimes. Can't review the tech support at this location but the store is always clean & the staff is knowledgeable about the products. Its a great place to bring your children when they are riding your nerves. They will infiltrate the store & keep themselves plenty occupied playing so you can catch your sanity. lol Almost as good as IKEA, now if we can just check them in here for a bit and go hide, hahahaha!

This location probably deserves three stars but if you're going to have a Starbucks in your facility at least honor star bucks cards. If you pay for the Barnes & Noble's Member book club (I think you have to wear a green member' only jacket to cash in on savings), which isn't going to happen for me because I don't necessarily enjoy reading as much as the next person, only then can you save 10% on your purchases. Ba humbug! Off to another store to find the book I'm looking for since Barnes & Noble doesn't have it in stock

This place is a little rich for my blood but sometimes you find yourself here. Always clean & the staff is always friendly-not what you would expect from a hoity-toity establishment. So far I've spoke with the eployees in the men's department & the Channel department & my experiences have been great, especially because I don't show up in my Snottsdale best to go shopping so to have a high class establishment eager to assist you makes me feel like spending a little chedda here.

Well the new pretzel burger is decent. Service was ok-you can only get so much enthusiasm out of minimal wage workers, lol. Food wise, everything is way to salty for me. Its like licking a salt lick, I know the cows back home would love the extra flavor of this place! Fries where way to salty for me & you can taste it in the burger. Its been a decade since I visited a Wendy's & if my Bf doesn't sucker me into another trip I'm sure I can go another decade & not bat an eye.

***DIVE BAR DISCLAIMER FOR THOSE GLAMOROUS STYLES***I think where people go wrong is they think this place is like the newly improved section of Gilbert that's all hoity-toity. It's not, don't kid yourself! If your looking for the douchey Scottsdale thousandaire "feel" you might just want to keep on stepping.   That being said......Probably one of the best dive bars I've ever been too so if you can reduce your standards a smidge and a half, then drop on by for some exquisite people watching, old skool darts, perhaps some pool and of course-cheap drinks! Questionable local celebrities frequent this beloved watering hole (not any you would know ).

Such a disappointment! I ordered my Fav-a carne asada burrito w/ cheese, sour cream & bacon. I know crazy!! I paid $9 for a burrito! Usually it's not that much at the other locations. So when I opened the bag of disappointment & saw the smallest burrito ever, well that left me sad. But the party just began cuz the taste of the ingredients topped off the dismal feeling put forth by this location makes me sad to say this location blows

What a super Toys R Us. My daughter is looking for a certain MH doll & of course they don't have it because its an exclusive, just released & super hard to find. But the young lady at the customer service desk didn't stop with none in the store stock, in the back or able to be ordered from the computer yet, she called a couple other locations to see if they had 1. Way to go! hats off for exceptional customer service!

I'm always like fry's. I'm a savvy shopper so I find their pricing to be reasonable and their sales to be excellent. This particular location is pretty cool. It's got a little bit more of a beefier deli, there is a built-in Starbucks, floral place and some kind of money laundering business. I think there's even an enterprise Rent-A-Car. I was just kidding about the money laundering place I don't know what it is really.... Store is clean and the employees are always helpful and courteous.

We are going to go ahead and keep this one short and sweet. I think all the banks (desert schools) are the same and I'm glad to have multiple locations throughout my crazy days. Did a quick little map search and of course this location came up with some not so awesome reviews. I walked thru that door of construction work and I was ready to lay a serious verbal beat down to anybody that wanted to get fancy. No luck, both tellers on the counter were very friendly and cordial to all the customers. Energetic and happy. I drew Jey and his up optimistic attitude was quite enjoyable. I left desert schools wanting to write a review because all the negative ones that I glanced thru need to come back and see if they've had a better experience.  Why four not five stars you ask? The place is under renovation so it's Just doesn't have that super awesome feeling but I'm sure when it's done I'm going to have to reevaluate. Great job today gentleman at the counter!

Taco Bell - for a fast food restaurants it's quick and easy. I've dropped into this location several times to beat down some tacos and burritos, among other things of course. My favorite is the enchurito but Word on the street is this item has been discontinued. But with plenty on items on the menu, I guess I can satisfy my taste buds somehow. You can always buy a burrito and a taco supreme then put them together and make your own jumbo size burrito supreme. Yeah, that's a J Monday special.....haha!  Location wise - it's very convenient. Pretty quick drive through. Can't say that my order has been messed up yet which is a plus for this food chain. Inside is a bit aged, doesn't have that awesome clean feel to it but it's not dirty either. Overall, when I'm in need for pretend Mexican food that's fast and fast, and I just happen to be in the area this will be my jam.

I've been here a couple times so I'm going to go ahead and give this place 4 stars. It's definitely not your average 3-star great clips. They go the extra mile to make sure you get a "man" haircut but they pamper you with cool little things like hot facial towel, massage chair, shampoo and rinse, etc.... I started going here because my barbers only open Tuesday through Saturday and certain hours which is typically hard on my schedule and these folks have a tendency to be open longer. All the girls that cut hair have been extremely friendly and it seems like an awesome atmosphere. Sports memorabilia all over the place and the tele is on sports news 24/7.

Today was an unimpressive day for BK. I was really feeling a whopper. Waited all day, starved myself until the timing/location was right. I've stopped at this location before for a mocha frappe and have always got good service & exactly what I wanted. Today however, it was a different story. Follow me back in time (bout an hour) with an empty stomach and hungry eyes........  Older gentleman at the counter greeted me and put the decision immediately in my hands with a friendly "what can I get for you?" Without skipping a beat, Double whopper with queso, hold the cat sauce (AKA ketchup) & dab a little extra mayo on that masterpiece. Since I'm starved but not willing to give up quality for quantity go ahead and enlarge my meal and replace those boring 1945 fries for some SATISFRIES wouldja! "What to drink sir?" Nothing made me happier than letting Mocha Frappe roll of the tip of my tongue & nothing blanketed my party like a snappy comeback from this older gentleman about the mix not being ready. Devastation! But, not all is lost. I attempted to trick my tastebuds into happiness by ordering the mocha iced coffee and I tried to keep my spirits high by remembering the very reason I stopped in here today. My infatuation for a whopper!   Well, about 10 minutes later (think they forgot about me, no honestly!) my meal was ready. I proudly marched back to the only clean table I could find and opened the white box of happiness to find a single patty of beef. Alone in a sea of salad. Tried a couple fries on the way up to the counter, and they were cold. The drive thru operator was quick to get the problem for me. That older gentleman quickly moved on scene to see what was shaking. I love older people because they have no filter. Quietly to the burger prepper guy he asks him "what the hell is wrong with you?" Now I'm not the the guy who's gonna complain about a little ass chew'n, especially since I come from a military background. Thats just an everyday thing in my book when you fall short at a simple task. Why do I bring it up then you say, because it was hilarious to hear this older gentlemen in action! I've got mad respect for this guy now and I'm certain if I get out of line he'll call 2 big guys from the back to help adjust my attitude, hahaha!  A couple minutes go by & the older gentleman brings out round 2. I duck, I weave and I cautiously open the little white box and POW! A double whopper with cheese, hold the ketchup & add sum mayo. Finally, I've gotten what I've been waiting for all day. Was it a home run, no more like an intentional walk but hey it's what I wanted so I dug in. Those satisfies on round 2-still cold. Well, I wasn't gonna cry wolf twice because the first time went so well. so I chalked it up as a loss. Iced coffee was pretty good tho.... tasted like chocolate milk-YUM! Just getting ready to leave and that older gentleman graced us with his presence from the shadows and offered us 2 complimentary breakfast sammiches for the inconvenience. A nice gesture for an unsatisfying meal.   Now that you & I have taken a trip down memory lane I leave you with this little JM fortune cookie. Never trust meal to be what you want when reviews from YELP say you better choose another idea......

I love Lo-Lo's! Been eating here for a while. Started back in the day when they were out of that rickety shack. Out of the 3 locations, this one is by far the best food and service wise. Is it just me or do the other 2 locations seem to have employees that are a little snotty....? Oh well, pound down some chicken and waffles or go with my FAV the Phatt azz chicken sammich. They always have Kool-Aid on tap too. Just found out you can get it with catfish instead of chicken. Hmmmm maybe next time!

The Biltmore fashion park is a nice place to shop. They keep the grounds pretty well-maintained and it's typically pretty serene. The patrons can sometimes be a little more uppity than my likings but what do you expect when you're at the Biltmore. They used to do cool things like summer/evening movies for the kids but I just found out that they killed that nice grass area to put in some more retail revenue. The cool thing about killing that family style idea to boost business is the fact that we are getting a short lease hot dog joint. Who doesn't love hotdogs!

I love me some Acorn gas! I met Mike a loooong time ago and I appreciated his honesty & willingness to satisfy customers. As a gas contractor putting in gas lines & LP tanks I need someone to refer them to for filling their tanks and the company that I was cautiously referring before Acorn just wasn't cutting the mustard! My name is everything to me and if I'm going to refer somebody they've got to be the best because all my customers will remember is me when they get that sour taste in their mouth from a poor referral. So far to date, I've helped save customers a lot of money switching over to Acorn as well as putting a smile on their face with excellent customer service from both Mike & his guys. If you have the need for propane & propane accessories (bahahaha-sorry had to do it!) this is my recommendation. Thanks Mike for always being so prompt, supplying me with high quality materials & taking care of my customers!

Affordable has done several projects for me and I'm at it again. Usually they give me a time frame and they call me a smudge earlier to let me know my stuff is finished ahead of schedule. The last project was some motorcycle parts and not only did they rush them for me but they looked up what colors the army actually used for the timeframe and matched it. No other powder coater has put that much effort into customer satisfaction. I'll post pics of my latest build once we get it back. I live in east Gilbert and I'll come out of my way to deal with these guys

I would recommend not going here. The pressure is low out of the sprayer and there's no soap like it's supposed to have and advertised. The counter is a bit fast so you're not going to get your moneys worth. There is nobody on site to help with change and you're forced to use their change machines which give tokens only forcing you to overspend. Save yourself from being disappointed and don't stop here.

Normally I would give 3 stars for these typical chain conglomerates. The negative side of Ace Hardware is they are a little pricey, the upside is that they are super friendly and eager to help you find what you need quickly. Since I'm from Wisconsin and I know the value of a good root beer I was pleasantly surprised to find my favorite brand here. Sprecher root beer & other flavors all the way from Wisconsin! Of course I'm going to have to bump the star rating up a notch on this one folks!

Usually I'd hand this place a solid 3 stars because I do like me some Rally's fries..... But I guess they were so busy they couldn't help but keep messing up the order. A side note-carpool to this location because they have a double drive thru. If you have a passenger you can take the left lane which is always faster cause no one uses it. It's like an HOV lane for food.   Ordered food for me & my employees and when I received the order it was a little light. I was missing 2 burgers & a fry. The fry was on the receipt, they just missed it but somehow they forgot to add the 2 burgers to the order, even tho she confirmed it back at the drive thru speaker. So I had to dish out some more coin and wait for them to make me some more food.   Food is decent but I guess today just wasn't their day. I won't be giving up on them but I would like to see a little better customer service & speed cause thats the name of the game race fans!

Ace Hardware is that store that usually has one of everything including those hard-to-find items. When Home Depot or Lowes doesn't have what you're looking for then you have no choice but to hit an Ace.   This location is a good location. The employees are Johnny on the spot so finding things is a breeze and you're in and out in no time. Downfall, prices are ridiculous and they only take returns from their own location. Even though they have that major store name they're all independently owned and operated. Nothing is more frustrating than going out of your way to return something you've been holding onto for a while and then finding out because you didn't buy it there, they won't take it back even though it has their name on the product.    Unfortunately, Ace Hardware's are a necessary evil and you're looking to find those hard to find items. Can't say I won't ever come back but I will say that I will go the extra mile out of my way to time.

What can you say, its a McDonalds. The cliental at this location is sketchy at best. Can't drown out the pure awesomeness by watching the tele because some guy has his home computer set up in the corner & needs both outlets even though he brought his own extension cord with multiple plug-ins. Lots of not so clean people with some health or drug issues rolling around looking ever so pleasant while asking to bum this or that. Not really sure if I'll get or want back what they are asking for (besides the $$$) so I think its best to not entertain their needs.....Surprisingly, my order came out right but my employees didn't. Its like playing taste bud Russian roulette. Your sure happy when you didn't get the bullet! I did however, see a shirt on a guy inline that made my day so I posted it on FB so everyone else can enjoy. Good Times!!

For a commercially processed meal it's not too bad. I like their spicy greasy chicken from time to time. Their new biscuits are pretty delicious as well. And they're sweet tea hits the spot. Everything else though just doesn't please the senses nor does the dirty tables. I would like to give this place three stars because I will eventually eat churches chicken again but for the 45 minutes that me, my buddy & our kids were dining there no one bothered to clean the joint.

Another great location. I wanted the cherry blossum frap and its gone but the baristas know how to create the taste without the special effects (eye candy). I don't care what it looks like as long as it tastes like what I want. Nothing's better than having their employees say no problem when I ask for something old skool.

I have no idea what all the negative reviews are for. I did witness 2 crazy individuals come in trying to pull BS so I'm sure that's where the negative reviews come from. Come on people, they're not going to break the law for you!  I have used third-party DMV's for a while now and they are exceptional. This one, probably the quickest service I've ever had considering all the work I had to have done. I had a transfer a title, get a veterans license plate and renew tags. The lady sells gold canyon candles so the place has a sweet aroma and I can't complain about the eye candy.

Best burgers in town????? Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with other Yelpers. I've stopped by a couple times since I stumbled onto this place and I'm a fan! I will quickly refer anyone here for one of their delicious hamburgers. A couple options in patty size, cheese experience and additional toppings on the grill. A couple fried vegetable options to choose from, zucchini & fries hit the spot for me. A full condiment bar to top off your burger to its perfection. Not much more you can ask for.....  FYI-They only take CASH so bring sum chedda. They do have an ATM tho in case you forget. Also, good food can sometimes equal a bit of a long line to get up to the grill and with being smack dab in the middle of ASU this place can get packed. Have a prospect grab you some seats is my recommendation while you drool in line for a delicious bite to eat

You know I wasn't a big fan of this place at first. I'm not much for Scottsdale thousandaires so I turned my nose up to this place before I even have it a chance. Thank goodness it didn't flood or I would've drowned too. This place is small inside and it can get a little warm but there's a patio so when the weathers right it's pretty pristine. The bathrooms are pretty crazy and definitely worth checking out so make sure you have to go sometime in between your visit. Enjoy the peep show videos in the unisex bathroom.  As far as appetizers go, we get the potato skins/fries with the salmon. It's pretty legit. I heard the drinks are good here especially the martinis. It's not on the menu but if you ask for a mango martini it will definitely not let you down. The espresso martini is probably a second runner-up to it. Every entrée we've gotten have been extremely delectable.  I tried 2 different plates and 4 different burgers and haven't been let down yet. I still cry and whine when everybody says they want to come here because I have to keep up my image, but I definitely like this place. For the time being I'll keep allowing myself to get dragged here

Joe's barbecue is an icon in downtown Gilbert. Great place to bring the family for some good food. They have a nice outdoor sitting area with grass for the kids to play in. The waiting line to order your food is sometimes out the door which really stinks but it does go pretty quickly considering it's a buffet style set up. The only thing that ever holds you up is the indecisive patron. As a connoisseur of food, barbecue is one of those things you take to heart. Joe's ranks pretty high on my list of barbecue do's. My recommendation is the stuffed potato with your choice of meat on top. Ribs are usually pretty delectable. They also have a pretty nice root beer on tap.

One of my favorite places for greek food. Gyro's are delicious & their greek frys are pretty scrumptious. They also throw down a buffet which is pretty awesome when feeding finicky kids. The owners are good people, very friendly & always a pleasure to speak with while dining in. Thanks for all the great meals!

Where else can you go to get a bunch of crap to make into some awesome fridge hanging, award winning, heart tugging items from your little kids endless imagination.... These stores are always pretty clean & well organized. Gotta tell ya tho, not like you don't already know, you wanna only shop here when you get that 40-60% off coupon. Your wallet & heart might as well celebrate its victory while your kids eyes are bulging out of their heads coming up with ideas on how to put all these items together in a single taj mahal display. I'll be back!

Ace usually has those hard-to-find items you can't get anywhere else but it's so annoying going out of your way to come here to spend 2x's more than anywhere else. Plus all the Ace Hardwares don't take back stuff from other Ace Hardware's. How ridiculous is that?

I'm a fan of Fry's grocery stores. This location has been here a while but the inside is kept up pretty well. When I'm on this side of town and I need some groceries, well you can bet this is the place I'm going to go to. Normally I would give Fry's a better review but I need to emphasize the disappointment I have in their fuel station. I was so excited to see that Fry's had bought out the local gas station on the corner of the same property they are in. It's cool because it's connected with a McDonald's so it's almost too convenient at times. Nothings better than buying gift cards for every day use and receiving 2x-4x times the fuel rewards points for discounts on gas-Bonus!!!! Unfortunately, this Fry's has decided to put their very brightest & best employee in charge of it all. Now I'm laying my sarcasm on pretty thick so hopefully you can muscle thru it as I complete my review......  I've ran into this gem of an employee before but her performance today was priceless. Somethings wrong with the gas pumps and people are potentially losing field points because of the issue. For some reason it's always the not so super awesome individuals that this happens to because they are always the ones that act completely irrational like the world is coming to an end. I find myself standing at the counter trying to purchase a couple drinks while I have to not so polite customers speaking over me to get the employees attention. Mind you, entering the store as well as making my way up to the counter I received no salutations. As I'm standing there trying to purchase some beverages to quench my thirst, the employee turns away and makes a phone call to whomever to alert them of the problem. Stands there for about a minute checking her phone then leaves me and a couple customers in the lobby while she goes to the back of the store and is gone from site. Thank goodness I'm honest and these other customers are enraged enough that they want some type of retribution or else we could have looted the store like the lyrics of sublimes 1992 riot song. Just saying-it could happen. After a couple minutes the employee came out and decided she could ring me up. I don't know why I stayed so long maybe because of boredom or the fact that I thought one of the customers would loose their cool & I wanted front row visibility, who knows.... Hopefully somebody important in the Fry's food chain will see this review & take the time to evaluate & determine if this employee is well suited for this particular position. Bon Chance.

$5 in & out. If your the person who's looking for every little spot to be washed away from your vehicle you might wanna get your ride detailed, that means take it elsewhere. This place is a self serve location. washes cars pretty good too so when I need a little clean between detailing this is a good spot. They have a whole role of vacuums on the side of the building (For those do it your selfers) and you can really get your whip looking so fresh and so clean.

My car has been a project nightmare but the guys at UMS tuning helped me to straighten it out. I've had nothing but troubles with my car from the start due to the crappy sales company selling me mismatched and refurbished equipment. Thankfully, the guys at UMS tuning were not only able to tune my car but helped me fix the some of my issues that these other supposive car specialists couldn't.

You pay a fee to get in. You pick your own parts then they charge you gold prices for used steel. I wanted 2 brackets & the price started at a rediculous $75. I bawked & the price dropped 2 more times. I still ended up paying way too much for sum lousy brackets. I inquired about some other parts I wanted and for a couple bucks more I should just buy brand new with a warranty. Crazy huh!!!

usually these kind of places get the old 3 star treatment because they are cookie cutter operations but I was impressed by the gentleman running the counter. He didn't see me waiting primarily because he was trying to help another customer. Waiting on them to make a decision..... Excused himself and apologized for keeping me waiting. I'm not a snob so I informed him it was no worry at all. His behavior was extremely out going. Greeted my daughter and you just just tell he was a man that is enjoying life. Pleasant to talk to and he encouraged me to have a great day just by his presence. Thanks behind the counter guy at CVS for making my day just that much better with such a great attitude!

This is my baby girl's dentist. We've been coming here for the last couple of years and we've always had excellent service. The staff are very chipper and thorough. My daughter doesn't mind going to the dentist, which is a pretty big thing for kids. She looks forward to getting her free toothbrush. for what I don't know because she has the most overly expensive battery operated toothbrush she can have. Plus she gets to pick out a cheesy toy from the toy chest so I'm pretty sure the combination of the 2 is what really makes her day.   This dentistry really seems to care about their patients which is awesome.

it's Fry's... I like shopping here because I feel like I'm getting a good deal on groceries. What really sets the place apart is the fuel points. 2x here 4x there. I buy gift cards for my normal monthly expenses and it gives me the fuel points I need to save upwards of a $1 on gas. We all need that! I stopped in this location for sum fuel but I noticed their parking lot had covered parking due to their use of solar. I've gotta say that impressed me. saving them money but doing good things for the environment.

I knew it was a bad idea to insult my taste buds with Wendy's salt lick menu but my little girl needed to make a restroom stop so   We started our dissatisfied adventure.   Restrooms were just as clean as the tables, not so nice! The counter guy was pleasant considering he was overwhelmed with his tasks. Trying to catch up from forgetting portions of people's orders while trying to take hours. He did have a good attitude tho!   Received our food and I had a nice long black curly hair sticking out of the box before I even opened it to find it nicely tucked into my hamburger. As I approached the counter, the manager was actually on the way out of the back so I was able to bring it to her attention. She quickly apologized and brought me out a new cheeseburger immediately. She thanked me for not yelling at her, which is very much appreciated considering both of us know how people can be with situations like this. Overall, Wendy's in general but this location not ring exempt has always been a bit of a let down to me. I do have to give a shot out to the manager though for her exceptional customer service!

I have no idea why I waited so long to write this review. Maybe because the line is long enough to get 1 of my favorite breakfast meals that I don't want the line to be any longer. Unfortunately, the word is out because this place is action packed even on the weekdays. I found this little gem while eating next door. It sits nestled in a quaint garden of flowers and greenery. Open patio seating in the front and rear. So beautiful and serene, It's easy to imagine yourself anywhere but Gilbert, AZ. Ordering takes place inside. Step up to the counter and the entire menu is chalk boarded on the wall. Delicious baked goods taunt you from the display case. Gourmet coffee harmoniously filling the air tempting your taste buds. If your not excited let me know and I'll grab the defibrillator.  I've tried several items on the menu but the 1's that impress me the most is the San Diegan. It's an open faced omelette with mushrooms, bacon, tomatoes, feta cheese, Shredded cheese and I think a couple other things. Delish!! On the weekends, if your lucky you can catch an amazing biscuits and gravy or an eggs Benedict. Mind blown! Tempt your taste buds with a baked delicacy, my advice the faux doughnut. What does that mean exactly.... The doughnut is baked instead of fried. Now get your self into the coffee shop and see for yourself what a breakfast bliss can do for your chi

Talk about exceptional! I can't believe I've never been out here before. I'm going to give you a quick rundown because it's just better if you experience all of your 5 senses for yourself. You walk into a nice large building and it's all very clean and nicely decorated. All of their products are right in the front, quick and easy to get to. From there you can walk to the register and purchase some delicious food. Plenty of seating next to the operational olive oil processing room. Take a five dollar tour of how they make olive oil from start to finish-pretty informative. Summers not bad because they have misting systems outside if you want to sit there. My recommendation spring, winter & and fall-grab some chow, enjoy being outside and surrounded by happiness that way you can make it a day trip. I will be back for sure! We were severely impressed with the flavor from the bruschetta and the grilled cheese with bacon sandwich! So impressive. Even the chips were delicious

OK. I was scared at first but now I'm a fan. My BF isn't known for having exceptional taste in food. His idea of gourmet is In&Out.  Yeah...... But it was his b-day so he gets to choose right! This place rocks a 2 dinner meal with 4 sides total for under 20 rocks! Scary huh, the steak was delish & I'm so picky that I don't hardly eat steak not off my grill because I'm a food snob. Loaded mashed potatoes, loaded sweet potatoes, sautéed mushrooms..... It was all good. For as packed as it was on a weeknight the food came out quick & the waitress, god rest her soul for putting up with us (me primarily), was on the ball. I'll definitely tear this joint up again. Way to go BF!

So glad I found this park a while ago. For a couple dollars we can stay and play all day or just a little bit and you don't feel like you didn't get your moneys worth. This pool has water slides, a lazy river, a great children's play area, a fun little "toilet bowl" experience and a diving/lap pool. Best place to spend the day with my little waterbug and not drain my wallet!

As a foodie, I'm always in search of the next great place to satisfy my hunger. The Casanova brothers definitely know how to run a business! I'm on crutches currently and one of the brothers saw me coming up to the door and he hustled from behind the counter to help me. Both of them greeted us with open arms and A desire to make sure we were 100% happy before we even knew what this place was all about. We exchanged greetings and names and they treated us like we were family. I found me a nice comfortable table to rest the broken sea leg at and gazed at the menu. There is so much to choose from! Right on the counter is the glass display with white pizza, Sicilian and regular pizza plus the extras like garlic dough (knot) balls. The owners treated us to some of their garlic dough (knot) balls since this was our first time in. I must say, I was quite impressed. For some reason people always seem to mess these up and the Casanova brothers fine-tune and perfect this recipe. After these delectable little appetizers were devoured it was time for the real deal. I ordered the 2 slice lunch special with a drink. Upgraded to Sicilian and I added meatballs and pepperoni to the mix. My girlfriend had the 2 slice meal as well with a regular piece of pie and a slice of the white pie. Both with pepperoni and jalapeños. In no time at all our table was covered in some of the best pizza I've had in a very long time! It's probably been 15+ years since I've had a true Sicilian slice of pie. Back in the day my buddy came from the Bronx and he opened up a pizza joint here in the AZ desert. Ordered every item from back home in order to make sure his pies were perfect! Only problem, he had to charge 20 bucks for a pie and back then that was a lot of money.... Back then most people didn't appreciate quality like the foodies of today. This thick, perfectly crusted gooey centered slice of Sicilian masterpiece with homemade meatballs and perfect pepperoni brought me back to the days of old. I can remember my buddy teaching me his secrets from dough to toppings all in one bite at Casanovas. This pie was so delicious I felt a shamed of myself for not wanting to share it with my girlfriend. Lol. But of course, she was so willing to share her experience with me so I felt obliged. The normal pie was good but quite honestly the white pie was off the charts.   Before our meal had a chance to settle we were treated to another masterpiece. You can't come into an Italian home and not try the cannoli. That right there my friends tells you if there a true Italian. The cannoli was spot on! Perfectly displayed on our dish and more perfectly devoured by yours truly.   I've had this place bookmark for a while now because of the awesome reviews I've seen and I can't believe that it took me forever to get over here. First place that comes to mind when I want pizza is Casanova brothers. Exceptional, over-the-top, just like if you were family service and the food is 100% perfectly Italian.

You guessed it, I have a young daughter. Every once in a while I've gotta come here to get my daughter some fashionable clothing. I like all the options & bright colors. My only complain is the pricing. There's a couple stores that do the same thing and it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Everyday is 40% off day.  Well then, just drop the gouging price down to reflect what you actually sell the clothing for. If your gonna have a sale, then list the discounted price.   On this particular trip I visited the "Red Line" area (clearance) on a Thursday I think. Why is that important you ask, because I think it's take an additional 40% off red line days. I bought several items and I still feel like even at clearance it's a bit expensive. Example. Cute little 2 piece bathing suit priced rediculously at $59. Take 40% off that cause everything is always 40% off then an extra 40% after that # to get your final price. After looking at the receipt I realized I can get the same quality of clothes at other major retailers for less. I'll be hard pressed to continue shopping here. Not because of the service, the quality or the staff but because the pricing is a bit much.

Kona Grill is a beautiful place but you definitely pay for the scenery in the cost of their meals. I ordered their chicken & broccoli stir-fry and when it came out I was unimpressed with the amount I got for $15. There was about a cup of rice & about 2 cups of stir-fry. Lucky for me we had a large party there so I was able to scrounge some food from my family but that didn't make things any better. My cousin had a steak that was average. My daughter had a kids cheeseburger that was actually pretty good. The other kids had the flatbread pizza which was very greasy and didn't really have much taste. Out of all the little samples of everyone else's plate that I ate, I just wasn't impressed. Simply put, I just don't like to eat here. Hopefully next time it's an option I can convince my family to go somewhere else.

Dropped in for some dessert, CHEESECAKE, and I knew an Italian joint would be able to suit my needs. Waitress was great, friendly & kept checking up on me. Recommended adding chocolate & candied walnuts to my dessert & I accepted. I left fat & happy. Now I just have to drop in to see if they represent Italy to its fullest

This place has 4.5 stars so of course I had to check it out! Owner was great, very friendly & personable. Don't know if its only on Sundays but kids eat free (from kids menu) with paid adult. I tried his newest masterpiece. A most delicious hot dog on a hamburger topped with a spaghetti sauce, Mac&Cheese & fried onion strings (I think). Very creative and different! My daughter had a hot dog and chips-exactly what she was craving. Afterwords we tried to Twilly. A Twinkie with a hot dog in it topped with bacon and peanut butter. It wasn't too bad actually, all I needed was a glass of milk and it would've been perfect. I will be coming back to try the classics but I had to venture out on this run.

So target has an item online cheaper than in store. I waste my time driving all the way to this target to pick it up because online it says has to pick up in-store only. I get here and purchase it and they will not honor their own pricing. The customer service lady tells me that I have to purchase the item online but still waste my time coming in to pick it up to get that price. So I return the item and get online to purchase the item and now it's not available because it was the last one. I have to wait a day for their computer to put the item back in the system before I can waste my time to come back here again and pick it up. Talk about annoying and what crappy customer service.

First thing that helps turn you off is having to pay for parking. There's no tram, no shaded parking just a company working more money out of your wallet. Then you get to overspend for park passes on top of it. Disneyland prices without all the Disney. Food and drinks are expensive, typical for these type of establishments. Parks pretty run down so I'm sure they're not putting all this money back to work to better this place. The new and improved lazy river is the same old dirty lazy river w barely any water in it so enjoy scraping the bottom of the pool. They did put some water dumping displays to "spruce" it up. Whoa....

I initially met Dr Saba at the hospital after we delivered my beautiful baby girl. He did the welfare check on us and I was impressed. I continued to use him as my daughters Dr but over time, them moving, us moving & us changing insurance we found ourself seeing another Dr. I ended up finding Dr Saba again so I ended up changing back to his practice and am so glad. He treats my daughter like he knows her, like family. I've had the pleasure of interacting with the other Dr's & staff as well & have always had a good experience. I will continue to recommend him to people I care about

Not the typical business that I like to frequent or even check out but when you have no choice due to somebody else's negligence you definitely want to have a doctor like these guys on your side.   Showed up in the ER on a fun Friday night to get a quick tibia repair from an unfortunate auto accident. Fortunately for me Dr Rhorer was on staff and his team took care of me. I woke up and found myself in this external fixator device. Basically it's like a suitcase handle for your leg. Not that you want to be carried by it though. It's meant to put your leg in the position it needs to be in in order to heal itself. I was told to check back in a little over a week to make sure it is healing properly and the swelling is gone down in order to perform a second surgery to actually repair my leg. Showed up a week later to the doctors office and they said I am good to go so we checked into the hospital and scheduled the surgery for the following day. Didn't really get a chance to hang out with the doctor to much but I do appreciate his work.

I just paid over $200 for a keyboard and a mouse. I know Apple is super impressed with their skills but I think they're pricing is a little insane. I chose to buy a used computer versus a new one because of the prices. Quality wise, it's a phenomenal product and I am extremely happy with the performance of everything I've purchased from Apple. Since I'm not reviewing Apple and its entirety, I'm reviewing the store, I must say that all of the employees are extremely knowledgeable and eager to assist you. There's been several times when the employees didn't have enough knowledge and they didn't try and pretend they did. They found the person that knew how to handle my issue and I appreciate that. This is a great location a visit, just wish their prices weren't so extravagant. I feel like I'm shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue

I dropped in to get some pricing on business flyers & door hangers. The girl at the counter didn't know what to do so she got a guy from the back. This guy couldn't give me prices either..... Took my email address & phone number and said he'd email me some prices later today and its been about a week & I haven't received a call or an email. I guess they don't really need business.

I put off seeing a movie because sequels aren't usually any good but my buddy insisted I watch it on the big screen so I looked on my trusty phone app & this was the only place with in a couple miles playing the flick. I showed up at the front entrance to be greater by a sign saying please buy your tickets inside at the concession stand. I had no idea this place was a dollar theater, well a $2 dollar theatre actually. I'm use to asking for a military or some kind of a discount but since the viewing was so cheap I didn't have it in me to ask for more off. Didn't purchase anything else from the concession stand that night but since I was a couple minutes late I hurried to find a seat in the completely empty theatre. Kicked back, put the legs up on the arm rests in front of me and got my relax on. It turned out to be a pretty decent movie. Great experience here and the place was clean so I think I will be looking into watching movies here, when they aren't worth an arm & a leg at the other theaters.....

Party City is pretty good about having a bunch of useless stuff you really need for some unknown reason or event. Just popped in for sum monster high birthday trinkets, piñata, candy & party necessities and of course they had a wide arraignment. I seam to come here every year to get my daughter whatever she's currently into & they always got the gear.

We've frequented this particular CVS in the past and I can't say that it's anything spectacular. Nothing sets this store out or makes it better than the rest. So for that, it deserves a solid BLAH 3 stars. I had the unfortunate ability to put their customer service to the test this evening. Due to everybody else's inability to perform their tasks I was given a prescription late in the day and waiting for someone to graciously drop things in their life and come pick you up to take you to fill a prescription can be challenging. I showed up with just about 10 minutes to spare before they started closing down. The lady informed me she didn't want to fill my prescription because it wasn't "enough time." She processed our paperwork in a quick couple of minutes and even though she had plenty of time to really make a good customer service decision she held fast and it looks like I'll have to be returning sometime in the morning around 9-10 when they open up at 8...... Those are her words..... A busted tibia and no pain pills equals one good time. Having friends has pharmacists, I know that it doesn't take any time at all to fill a prescription. It's just a matter of whether or not they want to, they already have the approval. They also have to close down shop and they have so much time allotted for that so there's really no reason other than poor customer service and for that I think we should deduct 1 star. I look forward to a night with no pain medicine why she probably sleeps on a sleep number. Granite, everybody else screwed off today (i.e. Doctors) but when you can do something and you choose not to just because you don't want to that deserves special recognition.

You know, I don't know why this place gets a bad rap. It's not some fancy gourmet roach coach or hoity-toity restaurant. This is Der Wienerschnitzel. You come here for chili cheese dogs with possibly onions, french fries, mustard, bacon or some other junk you can throw on a dog. You know exactly what I'm talking about, you get this anchoring for their sloppy, gooey chili cheese dog there's just no going back. It hits the spot every time! And are you really going to argue about the price? It's 5 for 5. You can't get bomb chili cheese dogs anywhere else for that price! I've eaten at this location since they've open the doors and I'm never had a bad meal. I've also never had poor customer service. Heck, last time I was in it was for the 19th Star Wars movie release and I got myself a Wiener saber...... Yeah, I'm pretty stoked that that got past all the scrutiny of today's society. I've got 2 of them tucked away in their original Wienerschnitzel plastic wrapping so just in case it becomes so taboo I might be able to make a couple extra dollars on eBay in 20 years. Come to Wienerschnitzel for the awesome chili cheese dogs or else just go somewhere else if chili cheese dogs isn't your thing

THIS IS A DISGUSTING COMPANY. DO NOT USE! They have extremely poor customer service and all they care about is making money.   They are contracted with my HOA to tow vehicles as they wish. I have a broken leg and I have to exit out of my garage to load/unload. My girlfriend parked her car at the front of my garage, came inside to help me get into the wheel chair and when we made it outside and we came out to a missing car. This happened in course of 15 minutes! We called the police to report our vehicle stolen and found out this company took it. This company is so money hungry that the driver did not bother to come to the door and see why the vehicle was outside my garage driveway. Per my HOA they are supposed to wait 20 minutes at the least before towing and they decided to tow our vehicle in under 15 minutes. I called this company and waisted 40 minutes trying to get them to do the right thing and bring the vehicle back. The driver would be able to clearly see I have a broken leg at that point. The last person I spoke to was Peggy and she was adamant about not provided good customer service. She didn't care they broke the HOA rules. She didn't care that I was injured. She didn't care that I have to now pay for a doctors visit, $150, for their mistake and greed.   Any company who maliciously hurts people should not be in business. Any company has the power to do right or wrong and this company chooses to do wrong. Don't give this company your money because they're not here to provide honest and fair customer service to people. They're just here to take advantage and make money.

I started growing hair after a brief 20 year military reign and of course I knew I had to find a new barber that could do more than the typical high and tight. I tried several of these high end barber shops in Phx and Scottsdale. They were great but they are pricey, booked out for a week or 2 or just have crazy hours. 1 of my buddies always sports a clean look with a mean beard so I figured I better ask him where he goes so I have a fighting chance at looking pretty. His recommendation landed me here. These guys are awesome! Excellent barbers, quick with a trimmer and a blade. Really great family guys and the place is always lively. Foosball table, tv's, music playing and plenty of laughter. Not sure if I'll keep up this new style for another 20 but I'm pretty sure these guys can handle the changes. Drop on in and let's get you detailed

Unfortunately I'm not a BIG reader so I typically avoid this place like the plague but I value the importance of learning so I bring my baby girl here to buy & read books. The staff here is always courteous & the store is always exceptionally clean. Love the fact there is a star bucks here because I'm already antsy about having to read, a good jolt of caffeine really puts me into the "Zone" JK...... We took advantage of their reading program for kids this year & I can really see the sense of accomplishment in my daughter. Nothing like a little hard work to earn something. Go Baby girl!!! Thanks for offering this program Barnes & Noble!

The post office...... I always approach these places with extreme caution and prejudice (It's a military term). Not because the patriots that frequent these establishments are questionable but after dealing with the employees, it's quite possible their behaviors have been altered. But the most important reason is because the employees are typically so disgruntled I worry one of them loose cannons might go off one day and turn this place into Chucky cheese shooting arena. ... Hold your breath - here we go! This post office is a quaint little location, decorated with a rustic hillbilly look. Quite small but it serves it's purpose. They have PO boxes, three tellers and they process passports, at least that's what it says on the door.  Fortunately for me I passed up Mr. ray of sunshine while filling out my package info. The gentleman who I like going front of me, was getting read the riot act from Mr. sarcasm with every comment he made. That's the guy I was warning you about previously, he's either going to go crazy one day or cause someone to go crazy, your pick. So now it's my turn, and I draw window # 1. A nice sweet older lady who had nothing but awesomeness bestowed in her. She made my purchase simple and painless. Part of me wishes that I could've stayed longer to enjoy an episode of Jerry Springer with Mr. sarcasm but, the other half of me knows that my patients wouldn't be able to withstand his excitement for life too long. So......... If you get the chance to visit this location, try one of ladies if you wish to leave in a pleasant mood. That's all folks

Sad to say but this review won't be a good one. Perhaps if we chose to sit in the normal seating area things would have went different. We sat in the bar & there was only 1 waitress to service the whole area & of course it's super bowl sunday.  Waters had floaties-yuk. The waitress says it looks like it's from lemons so of course we say we didn't have lemons with our water. So we get some new waters. Next is the appetizer- chips, salsa & bean dip with a side of hair in the beans. The kid's fries came with a complimentary salt like. So much salt on these bad boys you'd think it was a cured prime rib. Chicken came out raw so that went back to the kitchen.  But my favorite of all the unpleasantries was the fact that I had to try & enjoy my meal with a stack full of dirty plates in my face the whole entire meal.  My girlfriend had a nice friendly chat with the manager & he comped our entire meal. I always feel bad for complaining but there was so much wrong that sometimes you gotta stand up & say something.

I stopped in hoping to get a pair of shorts altered but I found out they don't do alterations. Being a guy you think all this stuff goes together. The staff was helpful in recommending some nearby places that should be able to help me. I noticed the barrage of items plastered all over the walls & I think I found a good place to have 2 of my portraits canvased. I'll letcha know when I have it done so my review will actually mean something

Guess I should have looked/read the reviews before I ventured I to this place. It's been redone & the sign outside says $2 car wash because the one down the street says $3. No $2 wash on the menu so I went all in & splurged on the $10 wash. That was a bad mistake. Got out to vacuum the car and noticed how horrible of a job this place did. My car wasn't even that dirty to begin with. In a hurry, I left without making a stink. As far as 2nd attempts go I won't give this place a 2nd thought.

This weeks award for the least amount of stars goes to this location. 3 whoppers w/cheese ordered - 2 no onions and the other no ketchup. Should be simple...... Pleasant girl at the drive-through window. Pulled out onto the road and when I open the bosses whopper it was all wrong. The boss is me of course. No mayonnaise, it's got ketchup and no cheese. Did a little U-turn and drove back to the location to get this catastrophe fixed. The nice guy that I am, i gave the girl at the counter my receipt and kindly explained to her I had no cheese no mayonnaise the plenty of ketchup that I didn't want. The order was initially taken correctly so cooks mistake here. Girl at the counter had to explain my order twice to the cook so I'm not sure their level of education but they didn't graduate from Burger King university yet I can guarantee that! Jumped in the van and started heading towards my job, grabbed out that fresh, hopefully made to order whopper and found myself sadly disappointed. Still missing the cheese! Grrrrr  I wish I had time to go back for a third hello but time is money so I must enjoy my cheeseless whopper. Sad is me

I really like me sum little caesar's but this location needs a little undercover boss. Ran by kids so there's not much to the order of things. It's basically putting out fires 24/7 here. Thank goodness the little caesar pizza making idea is almost bulletproof because thats the only thing that will keep this place together. Every time I've come here my order gets messed up. No one ever seams happy when they get up to the counter. Orders are messed up or lost in the mix. All the monkeys in the back are running a million miles an hour trying to quickly put out the fires and occasionally you'll see the monkeys fling a little poo.

Their button says it - that was easy! I find myself frequenting staples frequently. When you own/run a business you kind of need these places. Every time I stopped at this location I've received great customer service. The employees greet you right away and are very eager to help. Today's adventure included finding a new engineering ruler since mine is 20 years old and broken. The gentleman that helped me made a comment about how lucky he is not to have to use those and his engineering class because now everything is on AutoCAD. Me and my old-school dinosaur ways found me complaining about how I can't find a good enough software that's easy enough to use & this guy hooked me up! Told me how to find a $1,000 software for free!!! Right place right time - perhaps........ Looks like the employees at Staples, keep impressing me- kudos to you fine sir!

I tried this place along time ago, way before Yelp. It doesn't look like customer service wise anything is changed.   When you come out of the arena there's a bunch of girls rolling around with a bucket giving away free bull ride passes to sucker you in. We walked in and the place was about 50/50 empty/full. So of course we tried to sit where the bull was because we were dumb enough to pick up 2 bull riding "free" tickets. Guess what, you can't sit there because those spots are reserved even though nobody has it reserved for the night. Ok, well let's just grab a normal table then. Nope, we have to put our name on the list and wait for one of the empty tables to come up. We sit down and wait for about 15 minutes looking at empty tables and we come to the realization that this place sucks so we get up and we walk out. Guess what, we never got buzzed for a seat. We did get informed that we are on the waiting list but that's it. Way to go restaurant! Guess I should've read all the poor reviews before I bothered wasting my time.

I'm pretty set on who cuts my hair,I've  been going to the same barber since I got out of the military in 2000. But a barber isn't the place to take your little princess so I've got to rely on Yelpers to help me find happiness for my little beauty. I tried a place in Gilbert that I really liked but we moved so I wanted to find something a little closer to us. This salon didm't have a lot of reviews but they had 2 good 1's so I figured I'd give them a try.   Walked in with no appointment so I wasn't sure when we could get seen. The lady at the counter had me fill out the who we are form and went around the tiled wall waterfall to see which beautician could do a hair cut. Within minutes 1 of the ladies came out and greeted me & my daughter. The lady who helped us was very friendly and informative. She walked us over to her chair, prepped my daughter for a quick rinse and she got to work. I was impressed by her regiment and my daughter was all smiles so thats all that matters to me.   I'm gonna say 4.5 stars overall. My only pet peeve is the greeter didn't acknowledge us because she was on the phone, so we stood there for a couple minutes, but after she got off the phone she greeted us. A simple smile or covering up the phone for a second and a "Just a minute" or something to that nature would have been better customer service wise. Don't hold this against them I'm a business owner so I'm all about first impressions and customer service. I paid $26 for a child's hair cut, which is a lot for this army barber guy, but if thats the norm then I'll eventually come to peace with it. Let's just say I'm a bit on the cheap side-not too much tho.... Besides my little quirks this place was really great. The beautician was wonderful & the location looks upscale and was very clean. Again, all that really matters is that my princess was happy and she enjoyed her new hair style all day! This place has a check in coupon for a free shampoo so if you need a washing, here is your chance!

Its a good looking hobby store, very clean inside & a ton of crazy things you need you didn't know you needed. Only thing that throws me off is the constant 40-60% off pricing, please just rock bottom the prices. I'll get that warm & fuzzy feeling knowing that I'm getting things at a good price. Showing up & the things I don't know I' m looking for are on sale-just plain crazy....It's like they knew I was coming

I stumbled onto this restaurant due to my favorite mediterranean spot being closed. For some reason all mediterranean restaurants are a bit pricy, have you noticed that? well, I broke down the chicken Shawarma and put a good size dent in the hummus while my little girl tore up a gyro. The swawarma was pretty good, full of flavor. The hummus was good as well, it had a little spice to it but my daughter didn't seam to mind so I was in! gyro meat tasted good, not like I remember from being overseas so I'll keep poking my head around to see if I can find 1 to die for. Restaurant was clean but it was a bit warm. T-stat said 86* YIKES!!! a bit warm for my tastes, usually restaurants are kept around 76*. A good place to eat, great quality food, clean establishment & right outside the gym. I might just frequent this place a bit......

Lets start this adventure off by completing Mr. Rubio on his ability to streamline the taco/burrito business and keep it fresh. This location is always so happy. You walk in to a happy greeting and everyone is quick to check up on you. Never a bad fast food meal in this place. fresh salsa bar with plenty to add to your entree. Unfortunately the coolest stories I have are from the wacked out patrons that bless us with their awesomeness. I'll save you the story so that you can focus on the food.   you asked for it so here it is. Grab the fish tacos on discount fish taco day. The gourmet grilled shrimp tacos with avocado & bacon are scrumptious! Enjoy some tastily salsa-I'mpress your date by mixing up your own concoction....

The guys here at Gotham are great! my buddy Cliff brought me here to get stuff for my daughter & I've been back a couple times to get rare & hard to find items.   There's a coffee bar in here! all kinds of drinks too. There's a area in the back of the store for kids to play their games & also a section for playing video games.  Did you know every Tuesday night is Dr WHO time??? For all you Dr Who fans they watch a show on the tele, play trivia & there's a prize to the winner of the night....I would give up now cuase I'm bringing my other buddy here & he is a Dr. WHO nut so you got no chance, hahahahaha!   I don't frequent nerderies, aka comic book stores, but when I do this is where you'll find me.

Joined my fellow Yelpers for a little breakfast at Perk. I must confess, Its been a while since my last visit, due to the distance between where my life takes place and this little ditty. Of course there's a good size wait to enjoy this eatery but not if your a true Yelper, bahahaha. It also helps to show up a couple minutes late. The place has expanded. Joke on the wall says the pushed out the kids play zone to make way for a bar. I didn't find myself being entertained in this neck of the woods so I can't rate it but by the looks of the patrons I'd say they were definitely enjoying themselves. I must say the food hasn't changed! I order the Gus food channel recommendation-banana carmel walnut  pancake contraption. Not sure if I added or left out a couple ingredients there but you should know it was delish! Just so you understand how big of a deal this is, I eat breakfast all times of the day. Most importantly, nothing is more important than having some kind of egg concoction with lots of delicious meat(S) in it and perhaps a bed of crispy hash browns to create a heartiness, but these pancakes are sooooo good that I bypassed my SOP - standard operating procedure. When your in the neighborhood, this is one great place to catch a bite to eat.   My recommendation--- The banana pancakes. The other stuff on the menu is good too, but your not reading my review for good, your here for the Grrrrrrrrr-eat!

I was Looking for some tires obviously-22's that is. Planned on getting some tires on the weekend. Ended up getting stuck in Phoenix on a Friday night after 5pm. This place was not only open, stayed open late for me & had the best prices. they were $300-$600 cheaper than their competitors I had been getting quotes from! I just sent a friend their way & same story. He saved a couple hundred from his quotes at discount & big-o, even with his "commercial discount" When somebody needs tires, this is where I send them!

I regret having to write this review because I genuinely enjoy finding companies who can offer superior products and services at a reasonable price but unfortunately after all the tires I have purchased through them as well as my referrals have I now have a bad taste in my mouth that will linger for eternity.   Here we go..... I had to make some repairs to my suspension and afterwards I purchased two brand-new tires and an alignment from Mil Amore. Nothing has changed on the vehicle weight wise and now the vehicle shimmies really bad after 60 mph. So I had my mechanic, that I have trusted for the last 13+ years, to look at it it's and he says that the tires are wearing unevenly and that they are 8 ply and should be 10 ply. He checked the whole suspension to include the shocks to make sure that was the issue and sent me on my way. The other day I had to purchase truck tires for another one of my vehicles through discount so I had them check the tires as well and they said the same thing.....  I finally got some free time in my work schedule so I brought this particular vehicle over to mil amore & explained the problem to the owner. Basically, he came up with every excuse in the book why he would not take care of it. Even after I said I'm willing to prove that the shocks aren't an issue and rotating the tires to the back won't help the issue he still told me that even if I prove that the tires are the issue he still won't take them back because some BS about the manufacturers won't do anything for him.   So basically, the manufacturer's warranty is BS, his warranty as a business in the state of Arizona is BS & he will sell the wrong tires to anyone just to make a profit and he doesn't care about his quality, integrity or honor. I just lost over $500 to this business, hopefully people will read this review and not waste their hard-earned money as well.

Considering most people hate the post office & the DMV I'm actually quite impressed by the service and character of the employees at this particular branch. Last two times I've been to this branch I've received excellent customer service from happy employees. I will be going out of my way to bring mail items here

Please slit my throat already! I've gotta say this location could use a little bit of customer service skills building courses. i know you work for the govt (us) but I'm pretty sure your not making the peanuts most of the people outside this building are making working way harder. The overall attitude of this place is dreary. Thanks to Mesa (javelina office) having technical difficulties with their driver's license printers I had to come here for it instead. They put it in the computer but of course no one here knows anything about the other branch having any issues so you have to pretty much start all over. I was so glad to get my driver's license after an hour wait so I could go to my car and weep over the loss of an hour of my existence I'll never get back and probably wake up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night from having these memories of being stuck in this black hole. Is it just me or does this place rock!

Figured I would give this place a try and I figure I probably won't give it a try again. The kid at the window had a really big, extremely noticeable hickey on his neck, just unprofessional. Didn't have a very professional attitude as well, he didn't do anything but just seemed like he could care less. I ordered their chorizo burrito and added sour cream and bacon and it came to almost $8. Yikes! It was not $8 worth of size or taste that's for sure. There was a lot of salt and griddle taste and that was pretty much the sum of it.

Rigg's was referred to me & thats how I like to do business. I contacted the owner and we set up an appt for the next morning. The morning of, the tech called me to inform me he was running late and asked if that was ok. Good customer service-Better knowing than waiting around and getting upset. Showed up and was ready to work. Very presentable and clean. We set up the love seat and he was able to get all the questionable stains out of this gem I had found and purchased for a project. Cost was $100 to clean a love seat so I believe that was pretty fair. Overall, a wonderful experience & I will be referring them to anyone who seeks my advice.

I'd like to give a couple stars for the quality of the food but it's hard to judge the quality when they can't get your meal right....  This location is super busy & it looks relatively clean, that's about as far as I want to dig into it..... You ever get that feeling like your not wanted- well thats the impression I got from the lady at the counter. Felt like I was bothering her with my presence. Ordered a beef chimichanga and she confirmed my chicken chimi order so I had to specify beef. Ordered a couple rolled taco meals & sum hard tacos-all with rice & beans. With every item she asked "is that it" NO, we would like to continue ordering if possible..... read back the order and somehow we had a chicken chimi at the top of the list. had to revise that for a 3rd time. We specified rice & beans with all the meals. "OK, in come with it" A couple minutes later we received our order and good thing we did a quality check. Only the Chimi had rice & beans..... So of course we went back up to the counter and the lady then said-"you want a side of rice & beans? That will cost you....." REALLY??? We asked for rice & beans with every meal. Promised we would get rice & beans, got our order NO RICE & BEANS! Now we have to pay for it.   I like a Filiberto meal every once in a while but this place JUST PLAIN SUCKS! You know what else, I showed the lady my phone with my whopping $.50 YELP discount and of course she blew me off and didn't apply it. Why offer a cheesy .50 discount if your not going to honor it. It's only .50 but the snowball effect of their epic customer service entitles me to cry a little about everything.

I stopped here because my Yelp app said this place had Swarovski but unfortunately they didn't. What they had tho was not only blinged out gear for women & girls but super helpful employees that took the time to try & help me find a store. One of these days when I've got my little daughter in tow & we are scouting the San Tan shopping area I think we will stop in here and see if we can loose a couple bucks.

Haven't had pizza in a while so I tore up their new sicilian pizza & the jalapeno cheesy bread. The pizza & cheesy bread was good. My taste buds weren't disappointed. FYI- you can't order additional toppings on the sicilian pizza quite yet. kinda weird, I didn't think that it would be such a problem to figure out away around the cash register pre programmed buttons but I guess the guy who thinks out of the box must have been busy when they decided to come out with the sicilian pizza........

Starbucks - unless you live on Mars or potential you're a cannibal in South America you know what this place is. The only thing keeping Starbucks from 5 stars is pricing. Everything's uniform - comfortability.... Employees are friendly and typically pretty cheerful. Dropped in to get one of those cherry blossom Frapuccino's that is no longer available and of course they McGyver A concoction together that is an end result exactly the same to your taste buds just not as visually appealing, lol. Thanks to Starbucks I get to start my day with a little Frapuccino fun!

I'd like to give 2.5 stars for Jolie's. One of my buddies eats here all the time and he says he loves this place. When they're not out of something he loves their meals. I've been in here before for sports events at a birthday,  all we ordered was chicken wings and drinks.   I decided to try their chicken fried steak and eggs. My girl went for the biscuits and gravy. I ordered an orange juice and was sadly disappointed because it was that orange juice used for mixing drinks. It took a little over an hour for us to get our food and we watched 2 other tables come in after us and get their food before us. The food came out a little overcooked. The biscuits were hard and so was the fried chicken. I had asked for my hashbrowns to be "smothered"-cheese, onions, sausage gravy,etc..... They came out with cheese only on them. Considering the food was over cooked it wasn't too bad. The waitress was pleasant and she tried to be accommodating. She apologized for the length of time it took for us to get our food.   On to the next best thing.

Usually I'd give a 4 star review max for fast food joints (If they've earned it) but this 1 gets a solid 5! Not only is the staff great, foods what you should expect from cousin's subs but this location has Sprecher root beer from Wisconsin!!!!! The best because its from Wisconsin. Duh, lol  If you haven't had Sprecher root beer you might wanna get in there!

THIS IS A DISGUSTING COMPANY. DO NOT USE! They have extremely poor customer service and all they care about is making money.   They are contracted with my HOA to tow vehicles as they wish. I have a broken leg and I have to exit out of my garage to load/unload. My girlfriend parked her car at the front of my garage, came inside to help me get into the wheel chair and when we made it outside and we came out to a missing car. This happened in course of 15 minutes! We called the police to report our vehicle stolen and found out this company took it. This company is so money hungry that the driver did not bother to come to the door and see why the vehicle was outside my garage driveway. Per my HOA they are supposed to wait 20 minutes at the least before towing and they decided to tow our vehicle in under 15 minutes. I called this company and waisted 40 minutes trying to get them to do the right thing and bring the vehicle back. The driver would be able to clearly see I have a broken leg at that point. The last person I spoke to was Peggy and she was adamant about not provided good customer service. She didn't care they broke the HOA rules. She didn't care that I was injured. She didn't care that I have to now pay for a doctors visit, $150, for their mistake and greed.   Any company who maliciously hurts people should not be in business. Any company has the power to do right or wrong and this company chooses to do wrong. Don't give this company your money because they're not here to provide honest and fair customer service to people. They're just here to take advantage and make money.

I would give the owner and the employees 4 stars for great attitudes and good customer service. However, the pizza is what the review is all about and I can only give 2 stars for the pizza's performance. One of the two pizza's wasn't correct but the owner took care of it immediately. Got us the right pizza pretty quickly & asked us to keep the incorrect pizza. Initially, he had also discounted the pizzas for us which was very exceptional as well. The only thing I didn't like about the pizza, all of them, was that the bottom was so burnt. Just not my bag. Maybe I will try them again another time but for now I will still be keeping my eyes out for a better pie

Everybody writes a song about killing themselves while waiting forever at the DMV. I think I wrote 6........ Besides the fact that it takes all day to get seen I actually enjoyed the company of my government representative. I enlightened her day with a little sarcastic comedy & from that point forward she was a pleasure to have to work with. I always choose a 3rd party DMV for the convenience of getting in & out in10 but when u have no choice it's nice to have an optimistic employee to deal with.

Super fun! Brought my baby girl here & while checking in took advantage of their yelp deal. $10 worth for $5. Great buy! I was a little overwhelmed by the amount of choices but I was able to buckle down & pick a selection. The staff was super friendly & the atmosphere was fun. I will definitely bring my little love here again for a sugar induced comma

My buddy owns the restaurant next door and he said this place was really good for sandwiches and pizza so I decided to check it out. He was right, I ordered a turkey with avocado along with a barbecue pork with Havarty. Sandwiches came with fries and they were delicious. I think I will stop in again and try their pizza. The place is small for a restuarant but is setup very well and it feels bigger than it really is. Very enjoyable place to sit and grab a bite to eat. I will venture here again.

If you are ball'n on a budget this place isn't for you! They typically have pretty good deals floating around but for the most part the pottery is pretty expensive. On top of that you have studio time which is the cost for using their facility & paints. Enough about draining the wallet, Let's talk about customer service & memories. This location is always very helpful and we have never had any issues with them. My daughter loves coming here and we have created some wonderful pieces as well as some awesome memories so this place is definitely on our return and do list

Let's start off by saying this joint is not your typical Filiberto's. It's an actual come in and sit down restaurant with a bar! How crazy is that..... I'm assuming some crazy mariachi music is playing on the weekends and this place gets Vida Loco! I don't have much to say really. It was empty because it was a Monday morning but the place was clean. The waitress was pleasant and checked on us a decent amount of times. I ordered my 2 Filiberto favorites - horchata and a carne Asada burro. Everything in it plus bacon, cheese and sour cream. I know.....that sounds freaking awesome! Horchata was decent, I've had better but this was way better than most. Now the burro-imagine a small child delivered to your plate. This burrito was huge and well worth the $$. Filled with everything I requested. There's only 1 Fili B's in chandler that does it right like this location does. So next time I need my Mexican fix in Scottsdale ill be making a pit stop here.

So far not so good. I purchased a Samsung from best deal in town and turns out this particular Samsung has a board issue. Being the busy guy that I am, I waited till just after a year to follow up on it and of course the manufacturer doesn't want to take care of their bum product so guess who's stuck paying for a crappy product - the consumer as always and Samsung TVs aren't cheap....  Contacted this outfit a couple months back right after the manufacturer warranty expired. I realized it didn't matter when I get this TV fixed because it's going to cost me several hundred dollars so who cares if it's now or then. So I decided to put them off. Well, now the TV will have it psychotic fritz for 3-4 days solid so I guess it's time to get on the schedule. I contacted them on Monday and left a message and didn't hear back from them so I tried again Wednesday morning. The soonest they could get me on schedule was Friday. I said that was fine and I informed them of the problem. I requested for them to bring the board with them so that I could get this television repaired before the weekend because I am going in for surgery Monday and I'm not sure when I'll be available again. She informed me of her $85 show up charge to do nothing but look at the TV and I told her that was fine as long as it was getting repaired the same day. She also told me that I would have to have somebody there the entire time so that we could lift the TV off the wall so the tech could getting it. OK, so I scheduled for Friday and then she informed me that I would have to wait around the entire day from 1-5 p.m. So I made all the proper arrangements and found a friend to waste 5 hours of his day waiting with me.   The technician doesn't show up to till after 530. He does not have a board with him and he did not need my buddy here because he did not have the board with him. All he did was open the programming in the television and it told him what was wrong, which I had already done with the lady before. so no it's Friday after 530 and I can expect a phone call Monday sometime about the cost of the board.   I am surrounded by customer service with my job and if I treated customers this way I would definitely not have return work. I will update this review with the cost of the board and for additional customer service to follow.

McDonald's - one of the initial franchise empires to pave the way for every other company out there. Normally I stay clear from McDonald's because they don't seem too healthy but who am I to argue with all these new commercial campaigns they have about saying their food is fresh...... This particular McDonald's is new so it's very inviting and clean. I haven't had the pleasure of trying it out for myself but my daughter ensures me that the playground is good to go. Far away from civilization, this McDonald's has a double drive-through so either they're expecting a major boom out this way or there's some serious McDonald's lovers close by & they wanna be ready for anything.   The other day I tried to order some chicken strips and found out that McDonalds discontinued them. I was pretty devastated considering I feel they are somewhat healthy amongst the wide variety of potentially fatty carnage. Not to say that they are, but after years of having negativity drilled in your head about the unhealthiness of these fine establishments, you tend to start believing it. Feeling doomed for all eternity, I was recommended to try the new breaded chicken wings aka mighty wings. Low and behold, these meaty bite-size morsels hit the spot. They have a little bit of a flair to them as well! I like them so much that I forgot about the dipping sauces.   Hopefully the price comes down a bit because I can see myself ordering these from time to time. However, for a dozen wings I think it's a bit much. They might as well off for a bucket of 20 - 30 like their McNuggets or those chicken competitors.

Attention tea & coffee snobs-this is the place you wanna be!!! I've been stalking Espresso Italia ever since I got a sip of their teas. Espresso Italia designs some of the most amazing teas for valley restaurants and their flavors are delish!!! The guys here are so knowledgable & passionate about teas & coffee. not just teas & coffees but all the equipment needed to deliver the taste of their products in your very home. It's crazy! I feel like I've stumbled into the lost city of Atlantis.   I was greated by either the owner or the manager. I filled his head with my desires of their teas that I've experienced from valley restaurants and he quickly geared up to show me around. Took us into the back of the warehouse where the shelves flowed with robust aromas of coffee & tea. My eyes bulging out of my head as I tried to take in all the excitement they were partaking in. I was delivered to the great wall of teas where he filled my mind with knowledge of all the concoctions he's created. Naming those exact restaurants I've tasted the delicassies in which started this adventure a while ago. There she was, 1 of our favorites! I quickly agreed to a 1lb back bag of this delectable treat. Further research let me to a very promising green tea so of course I found myself bringing some of this home too! A couple minutes later a tea infuser was added to the shopping list & a satisfied customer was I. But the awesomeness didn't stop there. Our conversations of amazing coffee brewing styles led us farther into the warehouse where were entertained with an amazing delicacy. This mad scientist has created a remarkable robust coffee using a keg as part of the equation and he graced us with his masterpiece. An amazing coffee had been found by me this day. words cannot explain the excitement my tastebuds were selfishly enjoying. This coffee was so good I didn't want to put the glass down! I feel like Indiana jones. I finally filled 1 of my great adventures for finding a hidden gem to the beautiful world of food & beverage. Now to savor my great find & share my discovery with the world

I'm gonna go ahead and write a 5 star review too. I arrived and nobody was in the waiting room so I walked up to the window and a gentleman named Jay was eager to assist me. I had a ton of questions because I'm trying to figure out what's best for my application. Jay not only answered my questions but had some great advice and no matter what I threw at him he was pleasant and you can tell he was good at his job. Unfortunately, this arrogant individual walked in and started immediately crying because he wasn't getting immediate service. You know, those guys who like to complain about everything. Complained about how he should've just went to the MVD and waited 3+ hours versus the 25 minutes he had to wait. If you're this person, don't go to these awesome places that help to get things done superquick. Please by all means go wait in line at the MVD, pout and moan like an impound jerk to the government employees who could care less how long you waited. For everyone else who is cool and appreciates timely service and a great attitude then I would say drop by and say hello to Jay.

Super friendly staff & free refills on sum delicious drinks. Tried their tacos-they were good/ GF loved them. The burger & fry's was impressive to me. Great special sauce on the burgers & great on the fry's. As Arny says..."I'll be back!"

I finally found my Friday night fish fry! Hush puppies are great not over cooked. The burgers & fries are good too.

It's a Starbucks! Franchised food chain that offers exceptional coffee and service. Located on the northeast corner in the target shopping area but not the Starbucks inside the target.   Every time I've stopped into this location I have received excellent customer service! They have a drive through which is very convenient and a large lounge area which is nice for doing whatever it is you're going to do at Starbucks while soaking up their free Internet. I recently got turned on to the Starbucks card/app for my iPhone so this has been a pleasurable experience. Now I get all these benefits so why not come enjoy them. This franchise really has their stuff together! Five-star reviews all around

I had no idea this was a Johnny Rockets. I was over looking the receipt and saw the name on the bottom, I was surprised. Besides that, the restaurant was very clean & looked good. The burgers definitely had a good taste of them, but the fries were a bit salty. The drink station was pretty cool, there were about eight different flavors to enhance your drinks. Overall, next time I want a burger and I'm in the area I will probably stop here versus anywhere else. Great job JR aka Johnny rocket

So my friend has been telling me about this place & I gotta say I'm so glad I came along. I found some cool things for my daughter at a fraction of the normal price but for me I totally scored! Lucky jeans & buckle jeans for ridiculously cheap. I bought them out of my size! So get this.... They bring in stuff thats embroidered- back packs, lunch pails, bags, etc..... & sell them at a really low price. Easy for you to buy this stuff and just remove the name & save a TON. I'm afraid to go back because I will buy more stuff than I need, yeah its that good!

If your scraping metal this is the place! THey pay all most 2x's what everyone else pays for precious metals. Steel not so much, but who waists their time with that anyways! I always bring my AC & plumbing stuff here to help recycle vs trashing it & its nice to get paid a little sumth'n sumth'n for doing the right thing for the environment. THe owner & employees are awesome as well. I've been coming here since they opened their doors & I've gotten to know them pretty well. They help out the community & I believe they are a valuable asset to the environment.

I just bought my first Harley and bloody knuckles was referred to me by a good friend. Through all of this I have come to know these guys pretty well. Jeff is an awesome mechanic & really knows bikes. I had them preform the required Harley maintenance and after reviewing the invoice I feel it was extremely reasonable. A buddy with a similar Harley took a look at the invoice and said he paid a lot more taking it directly to Harley so that was good to hear. Not good that he paid more but good that I didn't get charged too much of course. This is the place for me and my bike

This is so great! Catering food trucks meet here Friday nights and compete for business with awesome cooking. I am definitely a fan of a couple of the food trucks that make their way out here so I was so glad to see them as I was driving by. Grabbed a Mac n cheese grilled cheese sammich-YUM!!! From the grilled cheese truck......Catfish filet fish n chips from buzznbeez & a super rich cup cake for desert. SuperTruck Super Food was out there as well which I definitely enjoy eating so next time I'll refresh my taste buds with their savory menu!

I have been to this auction many times. My advice to you is simple, if you're buying goods make sure you take a really good look at what you're purchasing. Test everything! I would highly recommend NOT purchasing motor vehicles or anything of that nature from this auction house. I have purchased a couple cars/trucks as well as other vehicular items and my experience has not once been pleasing. They try and clean them up, putting a little lipstick on the pig to mask all the issues but you don't really know the history of them. 2 of the vehicles I have purchased the codes had been cleared so of course you don't find out until later that it had severe problems. fortunately, I am mechanically sound but unfortunately I didn't want to buy a bunch of lemons. If your business is picking up crappy cars, cleaning them up and flipping them then this is your jam. Auctions are fun and can be intense and addicting but don't be a victim!

These guys are great. unfortunately the staff changes so much due to the environment but other than that I've always gotten great service from here. Commercial side is here now too so it's a perfect set up for me. I can rent trucks/vans for work from Michael or hit the normal rental car side and get a cruiser.

What a unique experience for kids, not so much boys so thankfully I got a girl to share this with. Brand new state of the art facility, so I'm assuming thats what your paying for at the ticket counter. A bit pricey if you ask me but the gift shop was actually reasonable so thats a wash in my book.....  We were just in time to catch a 3D documentary on the flight & life of a monarch butterfly. I've seen this before on the tele but it was pretty cool in 3D. Then from there we went into this staging room before the atrium were we got to see several different types of butterflies emerging from their cocoons. Pretty cool! This place is great because there is no rush, it's all at your own speed. After watching butterflies break out of their cocoons we were off to the atrium. a butterfly haven. NO TOUCHING, NO PICKING UP but if they land on you thats ok. Hard for a little girl to grasp so I had to keep reminding her. Trust me when I say the butterfly keepers are on it too! The only thing I don't like about this experience is Summer, it was nice and toasty in there and the humidity was off the charts. From there tho you can cool down in the snack shop before you continue on.....  The next area is about insects & fish. Really good displays of both & a shallow tank with sting rays in them for petting. Not as spectacle as sea world but worth saving yourself a 5 hour drive over. You make your way thru the gift shop and after that your at the entrance/exit, round 2-sure, there's no time limit, how great!   My recommendations is try enjoying this place in better weather, you'll get your monies worth for sure being able to stay longer. Thank you who ever put this together, a great thing to have here in the valley. I will refer like mad!

Brian the owner is a great guy! I've had him maintain my beach cruisers over the last 2 years before he opened his new shop. I've also referred some friends his way & he's taken care of them. Pricing is great especially considering I order everything custom & you know what that does to the ol pocketbook

I wrote a review for this company before they got their official Yelp site. I've had Bryan build 2 bikes now & repair & beef out 2 others. Always a pleasure coming here & can't say enough about the quality! Nothing like enjoying a beach cruiser bike ride with the fam and enjoying your ride. Thanks guys!!!!

I've been a big fan of FreeRide Bike Co since Brian and Ashley started it up. Together we have built several beach cruisers and I'm currently working on another masterpiece. I refer everyone I know to them. Great customer service, great knowledge and tons of accessories to deck out your ride! Bookmark this company! They occasionally do pub crawls and I believe ones coming up soon and you don't want to miss that!

Wow! What a pie! The chipotle or pizza is such an appropriate description for this place. It starts with a freshly rolled & pressed piece of dough. Then you pick your sauce, cheese & toppings. Off to the oven it goes! Right before your eyes these beautiful pies glisten as it bakes to perfection begging to be devoured! My choice.......The zookeeper special-every piece of meat known to man or at least what's available in their bins, modified of course with a couple garnishments from the garden to church it up. Let me tell you what-The dough is amazing, thin crusted and fire roasted to perfection. With all these toppings it's a masterpiece! I brought the toughest food critics with me and all of them were a static where there choices. Now I just have to find a reason to make it all the way up here unless they can do me a favor and build a location down by us. PLEASE!  Major important update-I just found out they have 9 locations so get your fired pie on!!

Could've sworn I wrote a review for this place. It's pretty neat, it's all wrapped around hotdogs so their menus a bit short but the items they offer are pretty legit. They also serve my favorite root beer of all time, Sprecher from Wisconsin. It's a fun environment so bring your friends and see what kind of fancy hotdogs you like!

A friend of mine referred me to this company. This guy is great! He works out of his home and he's got a ton of artwork all over the walls so you can see his quality. I'm working on a vintage Army beach cruiser and I'm having trouble finding decals. This guy was super excited to help, sat down with me & helped me find what I wanted & designed what we couldn't find. He had everything ready and knocked out in 20 minutes. His pricing - awesome! I have tons of projects for this guy and glad that I have found him

This is a very clean location! I'm used to Circle K's being dingee/dirty. I'm impressed with how clean it is considering how much traffic flows through here. You can tell that this circle K is trying to compete with QT. It's nice to see companies stepping up to the plate and competing for old-fashioned competition

If the mechanics didn't leave me bone dry I would've went the extra mile to a better gas station. Not only are they ridiculous in their cost for gasoline but they don't take credit cards, only debit and then they hit you with an additional $.35 fee. This place makes you feel like you're at a roast and the IRS is your host. Now I know how Charlie sheen feels, well roast wise that is.

Because Baked Goods. Outstanding reviews and visually scrumptious goodies lead me to believe I would be making the right choice by entrusting this company with my elaborate, Showstopping, over-the-top, Broadway production Valentine's Day. Ding-ding-ding! We've got a winner Johnny!!!! Owners name is Laura and she is amazing. I told her of my devilish plans to flood my girlfriend with as many deliveries of Cupid style instagrams as possible. Like sugarplum fairies my head was dancing with ideas. Laura reached through the phone and plucked those visions and brought them to life. Cordon Bleu Frankenstein if you will. I'd seen her caramel apples and I knew that had to be one. Laura suggested heart shaped brownies drizzled in chocolates and sprinkles. I'm thinking this coupled with a couple flower deliveries will put me on the slit throat list of her co-workers. While we were talking I told Laura of my plans and told her I had this ridiculous 6.5' bear being brought in but needed to find a way to get it delivered. You know if I did it I'd have to leave with it and that can't happen! This enormous display of affection has to be on display for as long as possible!! Laura offered to help me make this happen. Freaking awesome!! The bear of course arrived late but Laura kept in contact with me all day and we met in Tempe where it was easier for her and she snagged the bear.   I called the best rated florist and the best rated baker on yelp to satisfy my desires to make quite a scene this Valentine's Day and because of Laura it was pretty epic! Every girl at my girls work was sending pictures to their Sonchos saying this is what I didn't get this Valentine's Day. Seriously though, the GF said this was the best day of her life. I call that a Double Win!!

I don't know about you but I really love this place! The chicken is phenomenal and the sides are pretty decent. The sauce is catchy and they have more than just your typical soda. Love the sweet tea and their lemonade. Be prepared, this place is always a madhouse especially when the kids are stopping by for some lunch. Even with the rush, they push out some chicken fairly quick. If you haven't tried Canes, perhaps it's time to leave your house or moms basement and see what this place is all about.

Finally getting a chance to write a couple reviews so here's one. I was referred to Sean Plunkett by some friends of mine so I gave him a call and set up a time to come down to take a look at their vehicles. Sean didn't try to hit me with the used car salesman pitch and was very knowledgeable not only about the vehicles but the deals and programs going on. It was a very good experience for me, I don't have a lot of time so it was nice to have Sean just head up everything and let me know when my vehicles ready so I didn't have to wait around all day. Thank you very much for an awesome buying experience!

Nail salons..... One of those businesses you don't find men writing to much about. Just like any business though, a good nail salon is extremely hard to find. I'm the kind of guy who likes to have nice hands and feet. Nothing is more disgusting than shaking a nasty hand or seeing wretched tiger claw, ankle cracked feet out here in the wild metropolitan. If I was seeing your nasty feet while on an episode of 21 days naked and afraid, then I would totally not say anything but when you live in the city and there's just no excuse to not take care of yourself. I absolutely hate feet and will not touch them but they better look good if you're going to parade them around town in your $1 flip flops. I know some of you came here for my quirky antics but for the rest of your here's the review....  I like to make several visits to an establishment before I write a review. Unless, that establishment doesn't deserve a second chance which is highly unusual. I got dragged to this place initially by my girlfriend because it's her favorite. This place is great, you make an appointment and you show up and they are ready for you. Most places I've been to, you make an appointment and you still have to wait. What's the point to make an appointment right.....? They seem to have a ton of nail polish colors if you're into that. For me I like to go all natural. They have little bottles of water on stock to keep you from being parched. All the ladies here have been super friendly and I can't complain about the quality or service. Prices seem pretty average not higher than most places I've checked out. Even though they joke and kid around with me about selecting a nail polish color they don't mind changing the tele to accommodate me being the only guy in there. Haha. now I've got 2 nail places that I really like and feel comfortable with getting my nails done at. Here's 1 of them so if it's close to you give them a try.

UPDATE- usually I'll add an update at the end of my reviews but this is a major game changer! Klassy Nails now serves ALCOHOL. That's right beer and wine. I mean really...?

THIS IS A DISGUSTING COMPANY. DO NOT USE! They have extremely poor customer service and all they care about is making money.   They are contracted with my HOA to tow vehicles as they wish. I have a broken leg and I have to exit out of my garage to load/unload. My girlfriend parked her car at the front of my garage, came inside to help me get into the wheel chair and when we made it outside and we came out to a missing car. This happened in course of 15 minutes! We called the police to report our vehicle stolen and found out this company took it. This company is so money hungry that the driver did not bother to come to the door and see why the vehicle was outside my garage driveway. Per my HOA they are supposed to wait 20 minutes at the least before towing and they decided to tow our vehicle in under 15 minutes. I called this company and waisted 40 minutes trying to get them to do the right thing and bring the vehicle back. The driver would be able to clearly see I have a broken leg at that point. The last person I spoke to was Peggy and she was adamant about not provided good customer service. She didn't care they broke the HOA rules. She didn't care that I was injured. She didn't care that I have to now pay for a doctors visit, $150, for their mistake and greed.   Any company who maliciously hurts people should not be in business. Any company has the power to do right or wrong and this company chooses to do wrong. Don't give this company your money because they're not here to provide honest and fair customer service to people. They're just here to take advantage and make money.

I have got to favorite sandwich shops. Ike's is probably my favorite sandwich shop of all time. My other favorite sandwich shop doesn't have quite as many options but what they do have is legit. Let's talk about what makes Ike's so awesome. Just on the chalkboard alone they have over 500 sandwiches to choose from. All named after goofy people. The most important part of this whole operation is the bread, not just any bread, they have a bread they call  Dutch crunch.  It's amazing! If you become a fan you might want to go online and check out all of the specialty sandwiches that are not listed. My favorite is the "I think I'm pretty" it's a chicken sandwich with pesto, bacon, cheese & mozzarella sticks. throw it on the Dutch crunch bread-Boom! I was just in there the other day and found out they are starting to carry Sprecher. Do you know what that means? Now you can have the best root beer from Wisconsin and the best sandwich in Arizona all at the same time. Enjoy my friends!

oooooh, love these guys! Out of all the shops I visited for a low profile, not so ugly mirror, this place had it going on. Damien looked at my bike and said I got a mirror for you. Took me to their storage area and out came the most beautiful mirror that will look good on my bike and not be an eye sore. Everyone else just said, look in the book and we'll order you something...Well. if I wanted to take a chance I would have just done that myself, right.... It was a pleasure to have someone listen to what I want & have an actual solution. Way to go MainStreet Motorcycles. My bike is not complete & everyone at bike week loved my design. Thanks for all your help!  Locations a little out there but they got whatcha need! A little bit of everything. They even have a "garage sale" every once in a while so I'll be bringing in those parts collecting dust on my shelf & hopefully find them a new home cause they are helping with the rent thats for sure.

I would like to start my review by saying the gentleman who handled the rental was very accommodating at first. We had made a reservation from another company and it fell through due to their double booking so last minute I was searching for a toy hauler and this company had 2 left at a reasonable price. Everything went smooth picking up the toy hauler, I didn't have time to check everything out thoroughly because I was in a hurry to get my daughter from school so I did a quick walk-through and headed on my way.   Upon arriving at our camping destination I set up the trailer and the first thing I did was throw a couple burritos in the microwave so the kids had some food, you know they were starving from the long trip..... The microwave stopped working and killed the power to the inside and outside outlets. Well, this toy hauler just became a glorified tent. I searched the toy holler inside and out, looked at all the breakers and fuses and found nothing wrong. We try turning on the AC since it was a little warm and of course that didn't work either. By the next morning both batteries were drained from this power issue and we had nothing. The motorize Jack lift kept sticking so I had to use the manual crank no big deal but since I'm bitching so I might as well throw in the mix.    I thought about calling this guy name but since I was in the white Apache mountains with absolutely no phone signal I figured I would tough it out and I was certain that this nice couple I rented from what take care of us. When I got back into town I returned the toy hauler and that couple was out so I had to wait until they got back from their vacation to find out what they were willing to do anything for me. His answer was I should've called him & he would've fixed  it immediately. How, I don't know because he was on his vacation and we were 4 hours in the woods with no phone signal. So he did absolutely nothing, but he said if I'm going to rent again later, he'll give me a whole $50 discount. Yay! These people seemed really nice but honestly how can you be in business if you don't take care of your customers and supply them with decent equipment. You know the old saying-A happy customer tells friends and family but an unhappy customer will be sure to tell a lot more not to waste their time on such services.

I chose master engine rebuilding because they had the best price I could find, a couple 5-star reviews and the owner seemed knowledgeable and pleasant to deal with. Halfway during my experiences with master engine rebuilding I found that they had 2 listings on yelp and the other listing did not have rave reviews. Turns out one of the reviews is exactly like mine - promised a bill of goods and ended up finding out I was taking advantage of.   The initial engine rebuilding didn't take long at all just a couple days. This was in November before Thanksgiving. I was surprised at how quickly it was done and excited to get my work truck back on the road. About 10 miles away from shop the check engine light came on and the truck started sputtering. I drove it to an AutoZone and had the code pulled up and it was potentially an external or internal engine problem. I took care of the external possibilities and the truck was still acting funny so I brought it back. They had my truck for a couple days and then told me everything was fine so I picked it up and on my way home it did the exact same thing. This time I asked the owner to have his tow truck company come pick it up because I didn't have the time and I was losing my patience. He had the truck for about a week again and told me that he fixed the problem. I was busy with work so I had to send my dad to go get the truck and he called me to let me know it's doing the exact same thing again. This time I took the truck to an actual mechanic and he put it on his Snap on diagnostic scanner that he had and showed me not only the code that was the same as before but how the cylinders were firing and the fact that there was something wrong inside the engine. So I brought it back to master entering building one more time. This time they had it for a week and a half and the owner said he drove it around for 500 miles and it was driving perfectly. As soon as I left their shop it started acting up again but this time the check engine light didn't turn on.   I decided at this point that they are incapable of getting this job done correctly. I've lost several weeks of not having the truck for work as well as vehicle rental expenses. I checked with friends and ended up finding a mechanic in Tempe that not only has an excellent 5-star review but a couple referrals from friends so I took the truck there. Turns out the problem was internal and half of the block had to be taken apart. A lot of parts that were listed in master engine rebuilding's list of replaced parts were not done. The check engine light was broken so potentially that might've been damaged intentionally. It is a bulb that is inside the instrument cluster that no one ever touches so be your own judge on that. This little endeavor cost me over $2000 to have the engine fixed properly and $1000 in rental fees for having to rent a vehicle while mine was down. Not to mention all of my time that was wasted.

I wrote the same review on master engine rebuilding's other listing on yelp. I initially found that listing when I was making my decision to use their services. I wish I would've found this listing because I would've chosen a different mechanic.

Turns out the problem was internal and half of the block had to be taken apart. A lot of parts that were listed in master engine rebuilding's list of replaced parts were not done. The check engine light was broken so potentially that might've been damaged intentionally. It is a bulb that is inside the instrument cluster that no one ever touches so be your own judge on that. This little endeavor cost me over $2000 to have the engine fixed properly and $1000 in rental fees for having to rent a vehicle while mine was down. Not to mention all of my time that was wasted.

I was super excited about trying this place. Everybody's got it bookmarked and I even caught a special on the tele. I showed up at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and didn't notice a sign on the front door that says they're sold out. Sold out of everything basically. Everything except 3 donuts. The poor girl at the counter said this is been that way all week. My question is why does a business even bother to be open if they run out of food every day, way before closing time. I think the owner of this establishment might want to consider purchasing more material so they can take advantage of the hours they have posted on the door. Perhaps they should have a phone number to call to see if it's even worth their time before they drive all this way.... Hopefully I've beaten this dead horse to death. I will give this establishment another try so that I can improve their rating. Hopefully next time they have more than 3 donuts!

5 stars - for preserving nostalgic arcade games from our childhood and making them available in 1 place so we can enjoy them.  5 stars - for the price $14 for 2 people from 7-11pm. Unfortunately this dream is just barely getting started so Fridays and Saturdays is the only chance you're going to catch a good time for now.   5 stars - for a jukebox that's not only free but has the sweetest jams from back in the day.   The only thing that there is to complain about is a lack of space between the games. It's a little tight. Take in mind though, the owners of this establishment are working really hard to grow and provide us with a nostalgic piece of our childhood so the more we support them the sooner they can get to a bigger place and provide us with even more games! I had a chance to speak to both of the owners, I didn't clarify who does what but both of the guys seem like really awesome guys and they were excited to have their dream a reality.   I took 2 kids w me 8 & 11 and I've never seen them have so much fun in their life. They both thanked me and told me it was the best time they ever had and they really love playing these old games. Old or young this is well worth the cost. I'm really looking forward to getting the guys together so we can geek out and play sum old school games.

360 was referred to me by my orthopedic surgeon Dr Rhorer. They accept all insurances so that was a relief not to have to worry about that. Every single person that works here is friendly and cheerful. They definitely know what they're doing when it comes to rehab. The office has a decent sized waiting room but the sweat factory is pretty decked out with fun medieval torture devices to get you back to normal. They even have a cool little mini swimming pool in the back if you're ailments require. Evan was assigned to me and he's done a super job helping me get back on my feet and walking. Just had my check up with the doctor and he said my progress is ahead of schedule so that must mean these guys are doing a great job. Thank you very much 360 for helping me get back to life!

Good Ol' Portillos. Chicago based restaurant came out west to bring us some back east chow. It's a decent restaurant and the food is pretty good. You can't go wrong with the anything on the menu. Ask questions and make sure you get to try all the different ways to enjoy some grub.

I frequent this theater because it's conveniently located between friends. I've never had a bad experience ever. Last night their customer service was put to the test. I drove all the way home and realized I lost my wallet. In a panic, I drove back and of course the theater was already full people. I quietly searched the seat where I was sitting but couldn't find it. No one had turned it in to lost and found either. I spoke to a nice young gentleman by the name of DeAndre Williams. He told me it happens all the time and he said he would take a look as soon as the movie was over and get back to me. That he did, I had a call come in after that movie was finished letting me know that he had found my wallet and turned it in. Awesome awesome awesome, I am so thankful because everybody knows what pain it is to lose a wallet and have to replace things you don't even know were in there anymore. Thank you very much DeAndre Williams!!

Excellent business! Staff is super friendly and we didn't wait long for service or top-offs. Food was on point! Restaurant was clean and pricing seamed reasonable. I'm not a big fan of Thai food but my girl is so we eat it a lot. I actually look forward to going back to this place!

Well, I would like to do a little homework before I make purchases. I went to the Apple Store and looked at the new Mac's. Their prices for the new computers are a little rich, but that's what you get if you want to Apple. I decided to look into a used Mac. I looked at two other stores before finding this one. I actually came across their advertising on the side of the road-1 of those little lawn signs saying they were down the street. Dropped in and I was impressed. The owner was great to deal with and she didn't try to blow any smoke up my you know what. Her prices were right in line with the other two stores, maybe a smidge or a smidgen a half less. I found myself busy like normal so I didn't make it back to this location for a couple weeks. I just happened to be in the neighborhood so it seemed like a good day to drop by and see what Macs they had. They just received a pretty decent new Mac and the pricing was where it needed to be. I bought it and she threw in a couple keyboard protectors.  The next day I received a call from them letting me know that this computer just happens to have a three year extended warranty on it so she grabbed my email and sent that information over. Overall, I'm going to say this is a pretty great experience. Super friendly, knowledgeable and not pushy.
