Studio 3-26 is legit!  I get my haircut by Luis and haven't been disappointed once!  I was nervous, just having moved to Phx to try someone new, but Peter, the owner, recommended him and he lived up to his billing! Every stylist there is talented and friendly....you can tell they all enjoy what they do and where they're at.  Peter has done an awesome job at finding the right group of stylists that genuinely care about the quality of their work.  Highly, highly recommend.  Any guy looking for a good cut, go see Luis!

WARNING: Do not sign for a room without actually seeing the exact unit! I was told I couldn't see the room due to ppl still in it but would be shown one similar. I asked if the one I would be getting would have the exact carpet, appliances, etc. I was assured it would, also a patio w/pool view.  Why would I question this? 2 weeks later I sign and get my keys. What do i find??...crap carpet, no patio, absolute lies. Only thing that was true was the pool view.  When I brought this all up, I could tell the staff had dealt with this before, they were very versed.  Was told I would get a call from a manager...still waiting on that call. 2 months later.  Careful here, they will straight up lie to you.

It's refreshing to see a business and an owner go out of their way to really make their customers happy!  Not only did they have a good selection of quality furniture, the owner, Sidney, took the time to educate me on what to look for!  I recommend Do Overs to anyone looking for a quality unique piece of furniture...
