What a beautiful place to get robbed.  Probably not when what you were thinking when you entered this immaculate old country themed veterinarian hospital or lack there of.  After I told them about a KNOWN allergy to the rabies vaccine my dogs had ...they proceeded to give them the vaccine with an appropriate  benadryl shot beforehand, and send them home.... NOPE, no monitoring for even a couple hours.  So when I got home and my beloved pets swelled up like a balloon I rushed thm back to a SURPRISED office staff. They correctly gave both dogs (one was balloon-like, the other had a rash all over)  IV steroid and waited by ....for a little bit...then they RECHARGED me for the second visit an extra 100 dollars.  Hmmmm they like to charge you like its going out of style it seems.    Did I blame them for the reaction experienced by my pets..NO. DO I blame them for lack of consideration in billing me a 2nd time in the same day....YES!!

THIS WAS THE CHEAPEST LOCKOUT SERVICE RATE!!  I got locked out on campus in Glendale and the guy came all the way from Tempe! He charged me only $45 and made me two spare sets of keys! I was astounded and grateful.  It sounds like he drives all over phoenix, so if you are locked out call him!

They always go above and beyond. Excellent service and employees that care.  Banker Alen G. showed genuine concern and took the time out of his day to assist with my banking needs. I recommend going to the branch to solve issues. Especially if they do business like they do here.

Best Walgreens ever! They always make you and your satisfaction number 1. Love the staff. They can be busy like every other retail chain but if you are patient and give them a chance they always deliver great service.

Lost probably 10 dollars in gas waiting with only 1 car in front of me. Got a horrible variety. Realize its donut day but maybe they should schedule more than 2 people to work, you would think right? Last time I visit.
