Holy Shit - what a freakin good time!  Yes, it's:  Expensive! Douchy Affliction-ridden Fake tanned Superficial Etc.  But I loved every minute of it.  If you're not a hotel guest well then I don't know, but we got free passes and walked right in, no line. Sunday (Labor Day Weekend) had the biggest crowd and after a few drinks it's easy to lose yourself to the music, splashing and general debauchery that Rehab has to offer.  The staff was actually pretty cool. Not to firm with the whole bag check/searching, but no bubble gum. The wait staff (I grabbed a chair the first day) was super. She was attentive, sweet and playful - everything you could want at this local. The food (what little I ordered), chicken fingers or something was actually decent and came hot and within 15 minutes. The big drinks in tumblers were ~$25-30 and expect to put away 1 every 2 hours.  All in all, it was great and I can't wait to do it again! I just hope the frontliner doesn't stage dive on me again ;)  ps Thanks for the champaign Wyclef!

I had a fantastic time at the Playboy Club. It was posh (by the fireplace) and the staff was EXTREMELY pleasant. I couldn't attempt to fill my drink without one of the bunnies hopping up and doing it for me.  My table of four smoked cigars and enjoyed drinks all night long. When the place started filling up we had our own area that was kept clear of stragglers and mooches. When another friend dropped in with a gaggle of geese they were welcomed in past the long lines and made comfortable next to us.  I'm not a gambler so I can't speak to that, but the music was good, the dancing space was adequate and the drink mixes were tasty and abundant. There were no extra charges or fees (not even for my unexpected guests). The price was good and the seating location was superb. I'd definitely consider The Playboy Club for another night out with the fellas.

Horrible. Here's the letter (the 5000 characters that would fit) I sent to Brian Gullbrants, the ex operations head of The Ritz who now works for Steve Wynn at Encore. Needless to say I have not received a response in well over a week - not a good sign for a company who should pride themselves in superior customer service...  Brian, I had booked two rooms online. I intended on having my 3 guests split into two guests per room. I assumed a double bed would not be an issue, but just to make sure I telephoned your hotel the day after my internet reservation. I asked for two double beds, a high floor and connecting, non-smoking rooms. After confirming this with my colleagues, they asked if I would change the reservation to "smoking" rooms. So, the next day I telephoned and made the change. But upon arrival I waited in a "check-in" line for 25 minutes (with bags) only to find that none of my requests had been entered into your system. Too boot, none of my requests were available. My guests would have to sleep on roll-away beds. Good Lord! 45 minutes later I was able to secure 2 rooms (non-connecting) with double beds. The only catch, I would have to wait for an hour in order for the second room to open up. Okay, now all four of us are up in the first room. Let me put a few sodas I brought into the fridge. Nope. Not allowed. Fridge full. Don't touch items or you may be charged! Are you kidding me? Your mark-up is so high on these items you actually care if a few go missing? And you're willing to inconvenience your customers to do so? Sure I could call housekeeping and order a refrigerator for $25 a day (!), but since your room rate is up in the 10th percentile for Vegas these days I would think that wouldn't be necessary. I guess I could just use ice, but there are no ice buckets. Another phone call to housekeeping. Knock knock... ice buckets delivered WITHOUT ICE. Who does this? This is so bad in the eyes of "customer service" that I couldn't make this up if I tried. After the walk to get ice I received a call from the desk staff. My second room was ready; would I like to come down 61 floors to pick up my key? No, please deliver it to me for the hassles you are putting me through thank you very much. Did I have to ask? I'll try to keep the rest of the trip short but here are the highlights:  * $27 burger delivered to room. Was asked if I wanted the "included" veggies. Yes, why not, I'm paying out the nose for them? Oh, I see, the veggies you brought were old and you thought maybe if I didn't really want them you could save yourself a trip down to the kitchen. Lovely. * Cotton swabs had a dead bug in the packaging. Threw them out (after I took a picture; please let me know if you want it). Unfortunately, the swabs were never replaced. Glad I brought my own. I can only imagine the hassle to call for extras (and what you might charge). * Time for breakfast. Order in? Sure, I'm on vacation. $75 for the two of us. American breakfast I think you call it. A bit skimpy on the juice if you ask me - especially for the price. We almost thought you had forgotten one carafe... until I ordered breakfast the next day and received an even smaller carafe of juice. Do you carefully measure them out in teaspoons? Seriously, for the money I'm spending (and I don't have a problem spending money - or bringing in my gambling friends) I'm sure feeling nickel and dimed. I almost forgot... would I like a newspaper with my last breakfast? Why sure I would, thanks. I'm sure you can guess... it was never delivered. * Okay, time to check my email. Nope, that's not free either. In fact, nothing extra was free at the Encore. I didn't get a chance to go to the gym, but my guess is there would be a charge. * Back to the snacks and snack sensors. Your sign says 60 seconds may elapse before being charged, but the staff member that came by each morning to check the stock (!) laughed when he told me in only 15 seconds I might be charged. Had I known I would have asked they be removed from the room. Sure enough, I was charged for two snacks I never consumed (or moved). Brian, I could go on and on, but to be honest I lost track of all the issues I had with your hotel.  I'm not looking for a free stay, hell; you couldn't pay me to stay at Encore again. What I do want to know is how the former Vice President of Operation for the Ritz-Carlton, a man quoted saying:  * "Consumers' expectations of luxury are changing. It's not about going to the white tablecloth restaurant with the waiter in the tuxedo and the white glove. More often now we see customers that want to relax and enjoy luxury on their terms, not the industry's terms." -and- * "It's really giving the customer what they want, how they want it, before they even know they want it."  can allow this to occur. Please explain to me how the Encore embodied anything resembling what you purvey during my stay?  Thank you, Mateo M.

I'm not sure who the 5 guys are, nor do I care, but on my way to the airport we dropped in for a quick (10 minute) bite before hitting the jet stream.  Damn, didn't we just eat In N Out like 3 hours ago? Yeah, but they serve Hot Dogs here. Yea! Okay, so I wasn't helping my diet any, but hey, I'm on vacation. No, not really, but whatever.  One hot dog please! What would you like on it? BACON! and?... Wow, tons to choose from!!! I'll have onions, mustard and JALAPENOS!  My friends ordered a burger and a grilled cheese and I sat back and watched as the "guys" made all our food from scratch.  Everything was tasty and the fries were IMHO perfect. The price was good, the portions good, the staff were good and the place was clean.  Yup, I'd do it again
