Beautiful resort. Beautiful restaurant. Beautiful company.  And, of course, beautiful food.  My experience at Wright's was nothing short of perfection. Starting off with the service: attentive and professional, exactly what I would expect.  I ordered the Chef's tasting menu with wine pairings; a 3-course menu that somehow turned into 5.  The amuse was poached shrimp with a smoked corn and tomato relish, it was perfectly balanced and the smokiness of the corn complemented the sweetness of the shrimp.  Next was the asparagus soup.  I love asparagus anyway, but I LOVED this soup.  Thick and creamy, with pieces of asparagus and bacon, and a nicely poached egg sitting right on top.  The egg yolk added so much richness and depth to the dish.  Following the soup was probably my favorite dish of the night: a seared duck breast on a bed of prosciutto, tangelos, and a salad of petite greens tossed in a tangelo vinaigrette.  This dish was amazing; beautifully presented and absolutely delicious.  My entree was a heaping bowl of lobster rigatoni with green onions and English peas. Everything in the dish worked; the pasta was al dente, the lobster was rich and tender, and the sauce was delicious.  Dessert was the only disappointment of the meal, albeit a small one.  A macaroon tasting plate.  It was good, just not what I would expect from a restaurant like Wright's.  I left Wright's feeling fat, happy, and a little tipsy; everything I hope to get out of a meal when I go out.

Best dive bar. Ever.  Go see Beth and order yourself a "Clint Black." You can thank me later.

Great neighborhood sushi restaurant.  Happy hour is super cheap.  Buy a beer and get a 50cent app?  Sign me up!  My friend and I ordered around 10 rolls and orders of sushi plus a couple beers and our bill was only $50.  Sushi was fresh and good quality.  All the rolls we ordered were delicious.  4 stars only because the service was a little slow, but they only had 2 guys rolling sushi for the entire restaurant.

I love this place.  It's a great little wine bar right near my house, which means I can have that one extra glass before the end of the night.  The wine list isn't huge, but changes frequently and has a lot of variety.  Wines by the glass aren't cheap, but the pours are VERY generous, which makes it well worth the money.  The atmosphere is laid back, and the couches are great for relaxing and hanging out.

Wow.  That about sums it up.  Wow.  I've wanted to eat at Lon's for a while now, and finally got the chance this week.  Everything from start to finish exceeded my expectations.  First off, they have an excellent wine list;  I tried both the Malbec and the Zinfandel.  Very tasty and a pretty generous pour! We started with a caprese-ish salad of campari tomatoes and house made mozzarella, and for an entree I had the pork tenderloin and crispy pork belly.  It was served with a braised pear, grits, and sauteed broccolini.  If it were at all appropriate, I would have licked the plate.  My tenderloin was cooked perfectly (I asked for medium) and the pork belly just melted as I ate it.  We finished up with a huckleberry pie which, having grown up in Montana, reminded me of home.   This dinner wasn't cheap, but for the experience I had, I was happy to pay it, and can't wait to go back.

Food was decent, but definitely not worth the price.  Dinner for two with 1 drink each was over 60 bucks! For Mexican food! I had roasted pork with a chipotle sauce.  Nothing to write home about, and the sides of rice and beans were more of an afterthought.  The 2 stars in this review are for the pleasant atmosphere on the patio - that was the best part of the meal.

A friend and I had a wonderful afternoon at the Phoenix Art Museum last weekend, and the Arcadia Farms Cafe was certainly one of the highlights.  We were pleasantly surprised to see a full service restaurant inside the museum, as we were expecting nothing more than a food counter.  The restaurant is beautiful, and overlooks the museums courtyard.  It helps that it was a beautiful day, but the scenery in the courtyard made the experience more enjoyable.  Our server was helpful and attentive, and the food was delicious.  I had a chicken sandwich with a cup of soup. The sandwich was excellent; flavorful and not dried out.  The soup was good as well (maybe I'm nit-picking, but it needed a touch of salt).  The only thing I would knock this place for is the menu.  It's good, but not much variety. Obviously not a big deal, though, as I was able to find something I liked on the menu and enjoyed it very much.  The restaurant's other location is near where I live, in Old Town Scottsdale, so I will definitely be giving that a try.

Wanted to give this place 5 stars, but couldn't because they have no beers on tap, and a very limited selection of bottled beers.  However, this is a great little neighborhood pizza joint.  The staff was friendly and attentive, and the open kitchen with it's large brick oven adds a nice touch to the dining room.   I had the Pepperoni and Ham Rollatini, and it was delicious. The meat inside was perfectly balanced with the cheese, and the crust had a crispness that you can only get from a brick oven.  Everything at Crust was great and I'm sure I'll be back soon.

So I saw an ad for Indulge in Phoenix magazine and decided to give it a try.  It's been a while since I've had a really good burger, and I like the idea of the "build your own," which I was intent on doing until I saw their "Burger of the Month" offering...  a 1/2 lb burger with lettuce, tomato, red onion, onion hay, bacon, and ... (drum roll) peanut butter!  Granted I was a touch apprehensive about having peanut butter sloshed all over my bun instead of mayo, but was intrigued enough to try it... and I'm glad I did. The peanut butter complimented the bacon and really added to the overall profile of the burger.  My burger was also cooked well, which is a big selling point for me.  Couple that with $2 Landsharks during happy hour and I will definitely be back!

I tried Taberna for the first time last night.  I live basically across the street and had driven by many times since it opened.  I was not that impressed.   The major highlight was the patio.  It's large and comfortable, with plenty of heaters.  The food was good, but not great; the portions are small and certainly not worth the price.  I tried the fish tacos, steak tacos, and chicken enchilladas.  The fish tacos and steak tacos were great.  The enchilladas were soggy, mushy, and although they claimed to be chicken, I couldn't find much in the dish.  The beans and rice served with each dish were bland.  The same goes for the salsas.  A little seasoning would have gone a long way. While waiting for our food, we tried the margaritas, which were good, but not worth $8.50 a piece. I'll probably give Taberna another try in the future.  I like their menu and the ambience of the restaurant.  I think if they improve the food, if only with a little bit of salt, this place could be really great.
