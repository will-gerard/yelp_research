I have been to Sky Harbor many a times over the last few years. Most recently I was here last week for business travel. Overall I have always had smooth sailing at this airport. I flew Delta on this trip and went out of terminal 3 which was okay, not bad, not great. The food options were not as great as others have reported recently so I do think that the food options are in terminal 3. Security went by pretty fast. Airport employees were fairly nice, no was out right rude which was good.  Overall I have had good trips out of Phoenix Sky Harbor. I do recommend being dropped off or taking a shuttle. Parking on this trip was $75. Ouch.

I was debating on whether or not to give OTB 3 or 4 stars because the food is just okay but the service was great last night and the drinks were very good so 4 it is.   I had the cheese enchiladas last night with black beans and rice. The enchiladas were okay, the sauce was a little thick but not bad. The salsa is spicy which I like and I like to pour it on top of my enchiladas so this helped with the thickness of the sauce a bit. Our waitress was nice and very attentive. I ordered a Corona Light and she brought out a frosty glass to pour it in which was a nice touch.  I will visit this location again because the portions are good at a good price. Not necessarily my favorite Mexican restaurant in town but it's good.

Came to this location of On The Border a couple of weeks ago with a gift card that we had received for Christmas. It was pretty awful. Service was extremely slow for starters and the chips were cold and overly salted.  I ordered a sampler plate with a cheese enchilada, beef taco and cheese crisp. It also included rice and beans. It took about 20 minutes to come out and when it did, it had a very long black hair right on the top of the beans. It was extremely visible and I do not know how no one could have noticed this before it was served. I understand that sometimes sh*t happens, but this was ridiculous and disgusting. I was quite turned off to the whole experience at this point. It took a good 10 minutes to get the attention of our waitress to bring out a different plate. She apologized and was quite embarrassed by the whole situation. She asked if I wanted another plate and I hesitantly agreed. About 15 minutes later I had a new plate. I really wasn't very hungry after all of that but I did try the cheese enchilada which was really just okay. The cheese crisp was semi cold and soggy.  I do not know what has happened lately but this place has gone down hill fast. I will no longer be dining here.

I don't get a chance to go to Trader Joe's very often so when I do I kind of go all out. This location is located in a strip mall right next to a Michaels store. The parking is kind of crazy and the set up of the parking lot is weird, just be prepared for that. First off I love the selection of fresh flowers upon walking in, it is very welcoming. I made my way over to the cheese and meats section which always has a great selection. I picked up some great organic ground beef to make some tasty and delicious cheeseburgers tomorrow along with a great smoked gouda.  The frozen selection is really good here and you can find some unique and easy dinners for a busy week. The wine selection is outstanding and the prices are even better. Today they were sampling Macaron Prosecco which had a great fruity flavor and I added a bottle to my cart to enjoy alongside my burgers tomorrow.  Overall Trader Joe's has a great selection of organic products, unique frozen meals and great wine. How can you go wrong?

Went here tonight for my sister's birthday per her request. We had been here a couple of times a few years ago before my sister left for the military and we had a much better experience those times than we did tonight.  I got to the restaurant a little early before the rest of the party so I came in and asked if I could be seated. The restaurant was pretty empty at 5:30pm which is never a good sign even on a Tuesday. The hostess did not say her name or say much at all except for that our server would greet me shortly. I was seated next to a family of six with four small children and while I usually do not mind dining around children I felt as though the hostess could have seated me at least across from this family instead of literally inches away where the kids were screaming and running around the table. Pretty much every other table in the restaurant was open. The waiter came over and introduced himself and seemed very nice. He poured me a sample of the house wine and I decided to have a glass. About five minutes after that one of the children from the table over who was running around the table projectile vomited inches away from me. While I understand that this is not the restaurants fault it was extremely off putting and I really wish I wouldn't have been sitting inches away from them at this point. I immediately went to the hostess stand and requested a new table. She was accommodating and did relocate me to a booth but still very close to the original table with the child which was somewhat uncomfortable.  My party arrived and we decided to order an appetizer based on the waiter's recommendation. We order the stuffed mushrooms and a couple of salads. We waited, and waited and waited and finally our waiter came back to take our food order still no app after 20 minutes. We ordered our food and our appetizer came out about 30 minutes after ordering. Our food came out about 15 minutes later. Everything moved extremely slowly. Drinks were never refilled. No water was ever refilled. It was my sister's birthday so we asked if she could receive a dessert at the end of the meal. Our waiter said she could choose one so she chose the chocolate cake. It took 20 minutes for the dessert to come out. We were there for over an hour and not because we were taking our sweet time. The food was just okay but not great and I do not think we will be back again. Service is poor and food quality is just okay.

My last experience at a different location of Outback was not the greatest but I decided I would give this location a shot while in the area a few days ago. This location has a much more modern vibe and seems to have gotten an Outback upgrade in comparison to some of the other nearby locations.  The restaurant was busy but we were seated right away. Our waitress was great and had a good sense of humor which is always an added benefit. I ordered my usual, a 6oz sirloin cooked medium with diablo sauce and green beans. The steak was cooked nicely and it was not the best cut of meat I have ever had but it was not bad. The green beans are always amazing. My fiancé had ribs and he thought they were delicious. I also ordered blue moon with a shot of peach schnapps and my beer was nice and cold and on happy hour so I was happy.   Overall good experience. I would probably chose this location over the nearby location on Chandler Blvd. When I am craving a moderately priced steak I might be back.

I've been to this location of Ross a couple of times now. Today I found a Steven Madden handbag, two Calvin Klein maxi dresses and a Free People shrug all for $88 bucks! I would have no doubt paid over $200 retail. I was impressed. I'm not sure if I came in right after shipment day but I found the goods on this shopping trip. Sometimes these stores are not the most organized but this one is not to bad and if you are looking for a good deal you can find it with some searching.  The fitting rooms are small but clean. The fitting room attendant was friendly and upbeat. I did have to wait about ten minutes to check out but it was not to bad. The cashier who checked me out was very nice and we made good conversation.  I will be back to check out future deals on cute dresses!

35 minutes. That is how long I waited in line to pay for one dress yesterday at this location of Ross. By the time I got to check out there were probably over 30 people in line behind me that wrapped around the store and they were probably in for an even longer wait. I should have just thrown in the towel after 15 minutes but the urge to buy an amazing Calvin Klein dress for $12.99 took over. The staffing and management situation here is absolutely ridiculous.   During my 35 minute wait I observed many things. There were only two cashiers able to ring up purchases, one who was taking returns only but who did not help purchasing customers at all when no one was in her line. About 10 minutes into my wait in line, one of the cashiers who was ringing up purchases had to clock out for a break or to leave for the day. It seems to me like she was under extreme pressure to clock out because I heard her say "well now I feel under pressure" because it was taking her an extremely long time to ring up the person she was helping because they had a million and one items. I think that the associates are probably under penalty of getting pay docked or getting written up if they don't clock out on time (this is the case in many big box retail stores) which is an absolutely ridiculous policy especially on a busy day. If this is the case, someone should be ready to go right away on another register or a manager should take over because this would leave only one cashier to ring up purchases, and it did. This is when the line began to get ridiculously long and I was happy that i got in line when I did. I observed many associates "lingering" and chatting and while being a cashier may not be their job title, they should not even be in sight while 30 people wait in line thinking, why the hell are they not on the registers.   At one point an extremely irritated customer yelled out, "why don't you open another register?!?" To which the equally irritated cashier yelled out "a manager is on her way up!" We all waited another 10 minutes, the line moving about one customer every 3 to 5 minutes. I really kept thinking I should just leave but I had already waited so long at that point, which I'm sure is what most people in line were thinking. I observed many new incoming associates clocking in at the front registers but no one stayed to help. I felt really bad for the lone associate ringing people up because lord knows she was going to hear it from all of the extremely irritated customers and it really wasn't her fault at all, she was really the only one there working her butt off to go as quickly as she could.  Finally a second cashier appeared after about 20 minutes of being in line with just the one cashier. They did have about 6 registers in total BTW, that could have been open. The second cashier really took her time to get her register up and running. She was writing things down, looking around and seemed to enjoy that we were all chomping at the bit to be checked out. She had no urgency at all, no respect for her fellow cashier or customers. She opened the register after about 3 minutes of writing something down. The line slowly started moving a little bit. At this point some people had decided to leave but most stayed, irritated and frustrated at the situation. I finally was up at the front, next in line to check out. A loss prevention associate was gathering carts in front of the line and almost rammed one into my side. I redirected the cart right before impact. She very rudely told me that I could have helped her instead of watching her struggle, and biting my tongue I said I was sorry. I really thought to myself that I did help her, from crashing the carts into the crowd and why the hell was she moving the carts at that time anyways in front of a line of over 30 people!!  To sum things up. This store is managed extremely poorly. I feel sorry for the associates who work here and who are probably told off constantly by unhappy customers and by management. I really don't feel like giving money to a store that is so poorly run. I am done with this Ross store.

Now I must admit that this place holds some nostalgia for me. It is where me and my fiancé had our first date.  We have been back a few times since then and it's been okay at times, good at others. Tonight was pretty darn good. The atmosphere of this restaurant is nice especially if you get seated by the lake view tables. I have to say I was a little bit turned off that we were given dirty menus from the hostess stand. Someone was slacking. Salsa all over. But the service and food did make up for it.  We had a buy one get one free entrée coupon which was happily honored. Our waiter was very nice and kept our drinks refilled and checked in with us often. I had a cheese enchilada and a chicken flauta. My fiancé had a shredded beef and bean burrito. Both meals were very tasty. The enchilada sauce was great. The enchilada had just the right amount of cheese.   We had a good overall experience. There may be a few other Mexican restaurants in town that are a little better but I enjoyed the food and service. I would recommend Valle Luna.

I found myself wandering the aisles of Target yesterday to kill some time and left with many things I probably did not really need as usual.  I like the layout of this store. It is easy to navigate and find what I need (or don't need) quickly. I ended up with two new CD's yesterday and I found them at great prices. I also found some really great Essie nail products that I haven't been able to find anywhere else, Target saves the day once again. I also shopped the dish detergent section, the bottled water section and randomly ended up with some mac and cheese. Target is not a good place to kill time, you will end up buying many random things - fair warning.  I do find the clothes at this particular location to be a little bit lacking. The selection is very limited and a lot of sizes seem to be gone when I am looking through them. I will be back to Target many times. Hopefully next time with a clear direction of what I need but rest assured even if you don't need it Target has got it.

This Walgreens deserves a much better review. This is a location that I frequent for last minute beer runs and occasionally cosmetics and cold medicine and other last minute necessities. I have always had good service here. The cashiers are always friendly whether it be 4pm or 11pm. One of the night manager's is especially friendly and I will have to get his name on my next visit so I can update it on here. He deserves a call out for good service.  One of the cashiers named Cat is also especially helpful and friendly. I'm not sure if management has changed since 2011 when the other reviews were written but this location has stepped it up. Good customer service.  I will be back for my last minute necessities.

I recently started working in this area and discovered Aj's! I had heard rave reviews from friends but I had never been to an Aj's myself. I am very impressed. I have been stopping by every couple of days to try out the salad bar and soup options. They also have an amazing selection of craft beers that I scoped out today. I have not shopped here yet for other grocery items but it looks like they have a great selection of healthy foods and harder to find local items.   The bakery is also very nice and has a good selection of bagels, pastries, brownies and cupcakes. I ordered a green chile bagel here the other day for lunch which was delicious. The berry acai tea is also wonderful. Really I have not found anything bad about this place so far. The service has also been great on every visit. Top notch. I will be back.

I have always had pretty good experiences at this location of CVS. This is currently the pharmacy I am using to fill my scripts and the pharmacists have always been very helpful and friendly. The overall layout of this CVS store is nice. It is really easy to find what you are looking for.  There is also one very nice cashier who usually works nights and she is very friendly and we always have good conversation. Overall I would recommend this pharmacy to friends living in the area.

I was in need of trim a few days ago and I ran out of time to make an appointment with my usual stylist so I decided I would give Fantastic Sam's a shot. Every time I have been to a salon such as this (Great Clips, Super Cuts, Etc...) I have ended up regretting the decision so I should have learned my lesson in the past. I am sure that you can find good stylists at such salons but so far I have had no such luck.   Any how I came in on a Saturday afternoon. It was busy but I was greeted upon entering. It took about ten minutes for the two stylists standing in the back to decide who was going to come check me in. I do not want to directly slam the stylist who assisted me so I will just call her "L". L took me back to her chair and asked what I was looking for today. I told her that I would like a trim and that I was willing to trim up to two inches off. I also told her I would be interested in cutting straight bangs back in. She kind of laughed and told me that I wouldn't like straight bangs and that my hair looked pretty the way that it was. I knew that I would like straight bangs because I have had them in the past but usually when I stylist says something like that it is because they either do not want to do it or they don't know how to, so I decided never mind I will just have a trim.   The conversation was odd. She kept telling me that my hair was really fine and tangly (her word) and just seemed very immature throughout the whole process. The end of the session was the worst. I had requested a cut and style for $24.99. Her version of a style was blow drying my hair with a cold blow dryer and leaving my hair more than half wet out the door. I had mentioned that her blow dryer was cold and she simply told me kind of laughing that she thought the heater core had gone out (ya think?) At the end of the "blow dry" I just wanted to get out of there. The trim was okay, I still see many split ends and I'm not really sure how much she actually cut off but whatever. Bottom line, I will never be back. Save your money and do your research for a good stylist who knows what they are doing.

I live down the street from this location so my fiance and I have been here several times now. The food has always been good and the service is usually pretty good, the only time we have had and issue is when it has been extremely busy. The large size draught beer (I get kilt lifter) is almost as big as my head for only $5.86 which is pretty darn good. I have gotten the cheese enchiladas with Colorado red sauce the last couple of times and they have been great. The durango shredded beef burrito is also amazing and it's topped with queso sauce which is melt in your mouth. The margarita's are so so and pretty pricey so if you had to choose between beer and a margarita here I would choose beer. Overall good Mexican food at a reasonable price. I will be back.

Abuelo's has become one of my favorite local restaurants over the last few months. My fiancé and I dine here often and the consistency has been very good. I often times order two cheese enchiladas with onions and rice and beans  and they are delicious. My fiancé enjoys the steak and enchiladas and the ribeye has been very good quality meat every time. The habanero salsa is phenomenal and you often times have to request it but I highly recommend doing so if you like spicy.  The service can be hit or miss but most times it is very good. The management overall seems to keep this restaurant running very smoothly and overall we have rarely had any issues. Abuelo's hits the spot every time! I will be back!

Tonight we had a five star experience at Abeulo's. From start to finish we had a great dinner. This may not be a five star restaurant for everyone but for me this hits the spot and tonight the service and food were both top notch.  Our waitress Amy was wonderful and very engaging. She made sure that we had everything that we needed and was wonderful throughout. One of the food runners, Ryan definitely deservers a call out for his outstanding customer service. I hope that the managers of Abuelo's check these reviews because Ryan is really a great guy and he deservers recognition. He always remembers my fiancé and I and he always makes good conversation. He makes sure that we have everything we need and it is people like Ryan who make us want to continue coming back to Abuelo's again and again.  Every once in awhile the service is not as good and every once in awhile there is a mix up with the food but it has always been corrected and I understand that sometimes these things happen. But most times Abuelo's is great and keeps us coming back for more. The chips and salsa are wonderful, the selection of multiple prices of appetizers is great (I recommend the green chili cheese crisp) and the enchiladas are also very tasty.  Overall assessment is that this location of Abuelo's keeps us coming back again and again and that is the true test of a great restaurant, chain or not.

As I feel that over the years the quality of most Sears locations has extremely deteriorated, I feel that this location deserves a good review. I don't shop here very often but every once in a while I find myself stopping by an aisle on my way to the Sears parking lot. Today I was in need of a basic polo without a logo for an upcoming event. Apparently no one makes un branded, basic women's Polo's anymore and I never got the memo. Anyhow after about four stores and no luck I headed into Sears on a whim. I found a table with nicely folded basic Polo's, exactly what I was looking for. I headed into a dressing room which was clean and it was a bit aged but at least it wasn't full of discarded tried on clothing like many other mall fitting rooms.  I made my way to the check out and the gentleman behind the counter was very nice and seemed to have an interest in customer service. He folded my Polo's very nicely before putting them in the bag instead of just crumpling them up and throwing them in. He did ask the standard Sears card, membership and other questions but at the end of the day he is just doing his job and after working in customer service I respect that he can still ask those questions with a smile. I had a good experience here today. Sears is sometimes underrated and I have had bad experiences at other locations but they have decent merchandise at fair prices.  Give this Sears a shot. I can't guarantee you'll leave happy as I did but you might find you get better customer service than you thought you would.

I have been to this Z'Tejas a couple of times in the past and I wouldn't have said it was a five star experience but tonight was top notch.  We were quickly seated in a nice booth around 6pm. It was not super busy but busy enough. We were greeted by our waiter Matt who told us the specials of the night. I got the Chambord margarita special which included a Chambord margarita and two carne asada street tacos for Cinco De Mayo. My fiancé got the 21 day aged filet based upon our waiter's recommendation and it did not disappoint. Right away when it came out we could both tell that it was cooked perfectly and a great cut of meat. My street tacos were wonderful and the carne asada had a great kick to it. I joked with my fiancé for the rest of the night that I liked his meal as much as he did.  He gave me about a quarter of his steak and I enjoyed every bite of it. It was a little spicy, tender as can be and the mushroom sauce was to die for. The service was great and Matt definitely left a good impression.  Well done Z'Tejas, we will be back.

Tonight Z'Tejas let me down. It is unfortunate because I love the food here. I booked a party for six for a reservation at 7:30pm. We were seated right away in the upper level of the restaurant. Our waitress came over right away and took our drink orders. It all started out pretty well.  One of the members of our party had never been here before so he wanted to order three appetizers for us to all share. I recommended the Tejas Trio (queso, salsa and guacamole) and he told our waitress to pick two of her other favorites. Now I understand that he did leave this up to her discretion however, she chose two other items with shrimp and seafood in them. As a waitress I would have maybe considered that not everyone in the party would have liked seafood. I would have understood maybe one other appetizer with seafood but not both. Again, it was left to her discretion so I cannot say too much about this one.  I tried to get her attention two different times to order a margarita, both times she swiftly walked away, maybe I needed to be louder. All things I could have shook off if our meal would have been up to par as it usually is. I had recommended to the other members of our party to order the 21 day aged filet. We had previously had an amazing experience with this steak. Three of us decided to order this item. When they came out they were all New York strip and not filet. Not really that big of deal but when you are a expecting one cut of steak and you receive a different one, it is a little disappointing. My steak was supposed to be a filet topped with a peppercorn crust and topped with a mushroom sauce. It came out as a New York strip, topped with the peppercorn crust but no sauce whatsoever. My dining companions decided to keep the New York strips in lieu of returning them to re-fire filets. I decided to have a filet re-fired because my steak came out completely wrong. I reordered the new steak with the Gorgonzola butter instead of the peppercorn crust because it looked dry when it was brought out.  After waiting fifteen minutes, after all of my dining companions were finished eating, I received my new steak. It was a filet after all but it still came out with the peppercorn crust instead of the Gorgonzola butter. I just feel as though the entire night our waitress did not listen to anything we said. I really am not that picky but after getting all three of our steaks wrong, and getting mine wrong twice I was irritated. This was the place that my fiancé and I had recommended to out of town guests and I feel as though it was a big let down tonight. I just do not think our waitress could handle a big party along with serving her other tables.  I still might be back because I know how good the food can be here. I just think we came on an off night. Too bad.

I have been to this bowling alley a couple of times in the past year and it has been great both times. Today we arrived around 4pm and they were having a deal for unlimited pizza and bowling all day. The customer service was great from start to finish. We were all brought indivdual slices of pizza and whenever we wanted another slice it was always hot and fresh, the pizza here is actually really good.   The bowling alley itself is really clean and the lanes are very well maintained. Whoever is managing this bowling alley, they are doing a great job! They also had Blue Moon on tap which was also a plus. The music could have been a touch louder which I have never said about a bowling alley but they were playing great music and it would have been nice to hear it. Overall great experience! I will be back for more fun times!

This location of Starbucks let me down yesterday. It was 11am. I had met my sister here before we headed out on the town for the day. I was hungry for a breakfast sandwich or hot sandwich from the fridge that they will heat in the over for you. They were out of almost all flavors of sandwiches, they had only 3 left. They were also out of all breakfast sandwiches including the turkey bacon with egg, I understand that it was 11am but still, most Starbucks have these sandwiches well into the afternoon hours.   I decided to try the faijita chicken sandwich with pepper jack from the refrigerated section at the counter. The cashier was very rude about the lack of sandwiches in the first place. She got irritated that I asked if they had a ham and swiss sandwich when it wasn't out. Anyhow, she heated up the sandwich and wrapped it up for me. The chicken was disgusting and I pulled a couple of pieces out and they had black spots on them. I am not sure how long that particular sandwich had been sitting out but eww.  I did also have a passion tea and it was delicious as usual. Rule of thumb, come here only for drinks, avoid the food at this location. I would only come back for coffee or tea. Customer service was also not the greatest.

Pei Wei is delicious! This location always has great service even when they are very busy. I recently had an order of the crab wontons and the Korean beef lettuce wraps and both were fantastic. I have always had good experiences here. The garlic sriacha that they have in the little jars is also great and a must have if you like spicy.   They do have a pick a bunch of flavors coke machine so that is always good. The wait can sometimes be around 15 minutes during the lunch or dinner rush but it is well worth it. The price is around $12 for an average lunch with a drink but it is a great quality meal for the price. Overall, great! I will be back!

This mall has unfortunately gone done hill since my family moved to Arizona 10 years ago. My sister and I used to come here and hang out back in the high school years and just spend time walking the mall and having a good time. I do not think I would feel safe hanging out around here any longer.  We most recently came here on a Sunday afternoon. We don't usually shop the stores very often at AZ Mills but we were waiting to see a movie and had some time to kill. We made our way in by the movie theater and made our way around the mall. The hallways were so crowded at times we were barely able to make it through. There were so many kids screaming and running around without it parents it was alarming. Do not come here if you plan to have a nice leisurely day around the mall unless you enjoy shrill high pitch screams around every corner. At one point we were making our way around the Rainforest Café (which was oddly blaring loud club music) and we heard a couple arguing very loudly outside the restaurant. Eventually they started screaming at each other in the middle of about 15 people passing by. The woman screamed that she was going to call security on him, lovely. Once again, do not come here expecting a nice, relaxing walk around the mall.  The food court is one of the only pluses of this mall. The tables are limited on the weekend and you may have to wait 15-20 minutes in line. They have many options which are much better than your usual mall food court fare. I especially enjoy Great Steak and Potato and the buffalo chicken Philly yum! They also have America's Taco Shop and a new restaurant which resembles a Paradise Bakery. I really only come to this mall any more to go to the Harkins IMAX. If it were not for the theater I would not come here any more at all. I do not think I will be browsing the mall again any time soon. I would only recommend this mall if you have something specific in mind and you park near the location of that item so that you do not have to brave the hallways.

This review is simply about the quality of the IMAX screen and viewing experience rather than the surrounding environment (AZ Mills Mall). This is the only true IMAX screen in Phoenix. If you see a movie here you will truly be engrossed in the film. The screen is so big that sometimes it even feels as if your stomach drops even if it is not a 3D movie. I've seen several movies here including Prometheus, Dark Knight Rises and most recently Oblivion. Any "space" based movies are especially spectacular on this screen because you really feel like you are there. The bathrooms are a little small but it has never been so busy that I had to wait a long time and they have always been reasonably clean. I will come back to IMAX because I love movies and I especially love feeling like I am part of one.

For some reason my fiancé thought he really liked this place from prior experiences but I had never really been too impressed. It had probably been a year and a half since we had ordered Rosati's so I figured we could give it a shot, I thought to myself that it must be better than Pizza Hut right? Wrong.  We ordered the pepperoni classic (pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper and onion) and an order of garlic breadsticks. Like the other reviews, we were told it would be about an hour for delivery. That was fine, not really a big deal for a good pizza. An hour and a half rolls around and we were both getting annoyed. Eventually I see a truck circling our street and I saw him pull out and back in three different times. I let my fiancé know and I told him that I thought it was probably the pizza guy having trouble with directions. He went outside and the pizza guy didn't even come to our door he just met my fiancé at the sidewalk and gave him our pizza. Weirdest pizza delivery ever. No door knock, no introduction, nothing. Weird.  Any how, after that weird pizza delivery situation we were starving. Worried that the pizza was going to be cold and soggy after an hour and half. It was. It wasn't only that it was soggy it was also that the sauce had a very strange flavor to it. I can't really put my finger on it but I guess it was probably most comparable to watered down soap. Yuck. I had a small piece and I was done. The garlic breadsticks were the only redeeming factor of the whole order and they were quite delicious which is why I ultimately gave two stars. The marina sauce that came with the breadsticks however, was also disgusting.   Overall I will not order from Rosati's again. I will drive down to Spinato's instead and enjoy a delicious, freshly cooked and amazing pizza.

We had Barro's last night for the first time at this location. We dined in and had a good experience. The restaurant dining area is pretty big and was really full on a Friday night. You place your order at the front before seating yourself. The young lady helping us at the cash register was so young but she definitely knew what she was doing. I had a coupon for 25% off that was happily accepted.  We ordered six hot boneless buffalo wings and a medium pizza with pepperoni, green peppers and jalapenos. The wings came out first and were really good. Crispy on the outside and the hot sauce had a great flavor. The pizza was cooked perfectly and had a nice crispy crust and soft and fluffy texture. Being from Michigan, I love Chicago style pizza and I think I have found one of my new go to's.   Did not order beer or wine on this visit but did notice that they have great prices on both. I will be back to try more!

Wildlife World Zoo is a great place to see wildlife in Arizona. I would probably give more like 3.5 instead of 4. In my opinion it is much better than the Phoenix Zoo which is really small and has very limited attractions. WWZ is quite expensive at $31 per adult and $15 per child but you can often find coupons online good for $4 off per person up to 4 people with a google search. On the weekends they have informational shows with the animals which is fun. I think that some of the enclosures are a bit small for the animals which makes me sad but I think that the zoo does the best that it can.   This zoo is chock full of parrots of all kind free roaming the zoo. You will find some kind of parrot around just about every corner. The parrots can be fun to talk to and can be quite entertaining, it makes me wonder if they maybe rescue unwanted or abandoned parrots from around the valley. I wish that they had more information posted about the animals or more zoo employees walking around that you could talk to about the exhibits. It seems that they will be expanding the zoo as they have many signs posted about future exhibits. I hope that they do not raise the price anymore once these exhibits are built because it might become to much of an expense for a family if the price goes up much more.  The aquarium is just okay. They are expanding this as well but they need to have many more tropical exhibits. I know it is still fairly new and the fish are still growing in to the habitat but the aquarium still seems to be lacking something. Again more zoo employees need to be walking around with information because I would like to learn more about the fish/animals especially if I am paying so much.  Overall this zoo has quite a bit to see and it is a great spot to get out in AZ. Some things could be changed but I'm hoping they will continue to make improvements as they grow. I recommend going in January through May or October through December. Any time in the summer would be miserable in the heat because it is very exposed with little shade.

I have been to many different locations of Texas Roadhouse over the years and had pretty good experiences. Last night this location was just okay. Upon walking in there was an extremely loud country song playing (to the point of not being able to talk over each other) and it turns out the employees were doing a line dance in the middle of the restaurant. I do know that Texas Roadhouse employees do participate in various line dances throughout the night but this location is particularly "enthusiastic" about it. Maybe Saturday nights are country nights? Not sure? But quite obnoxious if you are not into that type of thing.  My fiancé and I were seated in a very small two person table in the back corner of the restaurant next to a party of at least twelve. Our waitress did come over right away and greet us and our drink orders were promptly served. We did find a mystery substance on one of the rolls we were served which was somewhat branch like, maybe a stem of some kind. We ate the other rolls in the basket which were still good and warm. Service was good despite being right next to a very large party. The noise level was quite ridiculous. I also a had a three to four year old child directly behind my seat who was in the most shrill way possible screaming in my ear throughout our dining experience. Yay great way to spend the evening. The Texas Roadhouse birthday announcement was done a total of four times while we there (lots of birthdays last night I guess). It is tolerable maybe once but NOT four times. It goes a little like this - ATTENTION TEXAS ROADHOUSE IT IS (insert name here) BIRTHDAY TONIGHT AND THEY ARE TURNING (insert age here) CAN I GET EVERYONE IN THE PLACE TO GIVE A BIG YEEEEEHAAAAAW!! The party next to us was particularly intoxicated and just about blew my ear drums out with every yeehaw given. After 4 of these I was going a little insane. I needed a shot of vodka stat.  The food was okay. Not bad. The steak that I had was good. Cooked just right and tender. My salad was meh and my fiancé's ribs were a little dry. I have had better Texas Roadhouse experiences in the past. This location is particularly lively. If you enjoy shrill screaming children, drunk obnoxious diners screaming yeehaw multiple times throughout the night and extremely loud country music with line dancing in the middle of the walk way, this is your place. I had never been to a Texas Roadhouse quite like this one.

I have had a good experience at CGCC. Many improvements have been made in the past two years and I think it is a good community college to earn prerequisites towards a transfer degree. The classes are generally about 25 to 30 students and I think you can get a really great learning experience from a smaller class size. The campus has a nice layout with a lot of open courtyards and a big library with many open computers. The financial aid and advisory office can sometimes be a little unhelpful but it all depends on who you are working with and if you don't like your advisor, request a new one. I have a few more classes to take here before I transfer to NAU for psychology and I look forward to my classes. I would definitely recommended CGCC for a good learning experience at a local college.

Let me start off by saying that the food is good here. It was the service that our group received today that was not so good.  My company often orders breakfast to go from the Breakfast Club for store meetings. For this meeting we decided we should have an offsite meeting and go to the restaurant. We met this morning (Sunday) at 8:30am. We had a party of four total and my coworker and I were the first to show. The restaurant was busy but we were seated right away. The hostess sat us at a long table that was more of an 8 top rather than a 4 top, which I didn't understand because there were many booths open. Once the rest of our group arrived a few minutes later we were given maybe two to three minutes to look over the menu and the waitress seemed irritated that we weren't  ready to order yet. She seemed like she was in a constant rush the entire time.  I ordered the jalapeno biscuits and gravy which were amazing. The flavor of the gravy is great and it is also served with potatoes o brien which were also delicious. My group all finished their food rather quickly because we felt as though we were being rushed through our meal because our waitress constantly was hovering the table asking if we needed anything (in a pestering way not a helpful way). After our plates were cleared I had planned to do a quick team building exercise that would maybe take an extra 15 to 20 minutes max. I do understand that the restaurant was busy but I do not appreciate being rushed out while many other families were enjoying their meals for much longer than we planned to be here. Eventually the waitress came over and stated that she would be seating a party next to us (we were sitting on a bench style seat) which I had no problem with but it was the way in which we were approached that I did not appreciate. I just feel like the entire meal was extremely rushed and that made the experience not enjoyable for our whole team. If I were to plan a breakfast business meeting again anytime soon, I would not bring my business back to the Breakfast Club.  It is unfortunate because the food is great. I guess it's to go orders only from here on out.

This review is specifically for the Nordstrom Café located on the third level near the children's section. I didn't want to create an entirely new page for the café so I figured I would just write my review on the Nordstrom main page.  This is a hidden gem of a café tucked away in a small corner of Nordstrom's. I had never dined here before but met a colleague here for a lunch meeting today and it was wonderful. The prices are a little steep but the food is great and the service is top notch. I ordered a Caesar salad with a cup of chicken tortilla soup and my colleague had a cilantro lime salad with chicken. Both of our meals were delicious. You order at the front, express style and then a server comes around to check on drink refills, clear plates, make sure you are enjoying your meal etc... Overall I had a great experience here. I would come back for sure. They had a great variety of items for lunch including, wild mushroom ravioli, pepperoni flatbread pizza, spicy Italian calzone, and many salad options. Good experience.   As far as the rest of the store goes it is pretty amazing as well. This is a three level Nordstrom store with many great designer labels and fantastic makeup and shoe selection. The associates who have assisted me have always been helpful and down to earth. I will be back.

Let me start off by saying that I love Bath and Body Works products. I love the candles most of all and the fall scents are my absolute favorite. So when I found out that the fall scents had come out this week I was excited.  I have been to this location a few times before because I am in this area often. Every time I have shopped here I feel as though I am attacked as if I am prey in a pack of ravenous, sale seeking wolves. Yesterday was especially bad. I am not sure the of the guy's name who was following me around like a lost puppy who would not stop talking but he really needs to know when someone is giving him the vibe of give it a rest and leave me alone. The second I entered the door I was greeted by three associates. He was especially interested in what I was looking for and I let him know that I had just come in to check out the new fall scents. He immediately came over and shared with me all of his favorites, and while I am happy for him that those are his favorites, my scent choices were much different than his. I told him thank you for showing me those and I am just going to look around. About one minute later he was back at my side picking up my hand and rubbing lotion on me! Without even asking me! This crossed the line. I did not have an immediate bad reaction but I was really feeling off put by this point. I told him once again that I just wanted to look around and I would let him know if I had a question.  I quickly went to the opposite corner to the store to try to find the mini candles. I started sampling the different scents of candles and low and behold about five minutes later here he is again. He had brought with him five new scents of candles that he wanted me smell. Before I could say no thanks he had one opened and in my face. I am very sensitive to smell and I know what I like and it was not those scents! I told him for the third time I am just looking over here. A moment later another associate comes over and starts telling me about her favorite scents! I am just thinking to myself at this point I just want to be left alone and chose my own freakin scents! I guess I should have just said that. By the end of this visit I just wanted to scream, I just want to be left ALONE!   I have had this same type of experience at this store once before where I felt as though I was almost being scolded for not buying the better sale that they had at the time. I did take the survey that they offer at the bottom of the receipt about that experience as well as emailing the manager but never heard a word back. I do love the fragrances here but I think I am absolutely done with this location. These associates are like hounds searching for the hunt and I cannot stand it. Back off people! I do not need someone to hold my hand (literally) while I shop. I will seek  you out if I need you. There is a fine line between providing good customer service and WAY over doing it to the point of chasing customers away. Please managers of this location, tell  your associates to back down!!

This Dillard's location is very nice. I have been here a couple of times recently for various items, dresses, boots, makeup, etc... and I have been very happy with the selection.  One of my favorite designers, Karen Kane has a very large section at this particular location and sometimes does trunk shows here which is great. The customer service has been good at this location and I feel like the associates are helpful without being overly aggressive. The jewelry selection is really good here as well and I have found some really nice pieces at great prices.  I have not shopped all departments of this store but they do have anything from housewares to children's clothes to bedding. A lot to chose from. The price range can be from very expensive to very affordable depending on the product and or the sale going on. Overall this is a great store for many items. I would recommend it when shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square.

How could you possibly dislike The Disney Store? Childhood nostalgia around every corner. I do feel as though some of the associates here have to put on a forced happy face but I have never had a bad experience. I came in the other day with my friend to pick up a gift for her nephew and we both had a great time reminiscing of Disney memories.   The prices are steep but you pay for the Disney name more than anything. They do have a nice sale selection which helps save some pennies. Just go in, watch some toons and hug a giant stuffed animal, guaranteed to make your day better.

This review is based purely on the venue and not the productions held here. I have seen many shows at Gammage. Recently I have seen War Horse and Beauty and the Beast in the orchestra section which have both been amazing! Gammage itself however is not so amazing. The outside of the building is beautiful and eye catching but the inside not so much.   The restroom situation alone is enough for any woman to go crazy. Gammage has two restroom locations. One is on the second floor and quite a walk from the orchestra section seats especially when you only have fifteen minutes during intermission and the second location is on the third floor near the top balcony. Once you get to the bathroom, no matter when, before the show, during intermission (is the worst), and after the show, the wait is at least 25 to 30 women waiting, 10 to 15 minutes. Forget having time to purchase a drink or snack. The bathroom itself has only six stalls which are dimly lit (more like you need a flashlight to see anything) and old as can be. Once you are finally done using the facilities and need to dry your hands after washing, good luck with the paper towel line if the dispenser is even working. Bottom line, use the bathroom before and after the show not at Gammage which I know can sometimes be difficult during a 2 to 4 hour show. Note to Gammage - Immediately do a renovation on the bathrooms! Ticket sales will increase as a result!  The seats are just okay. The performances are usually amazing and it usually does not matter where you sit in that regard but the cushions on seat backs once again could use some renovation. I will continue going to Gammage because it is one of the only locations in Phoenix to host Broadway productions but I do hope that they make some improvements in the near future.

I was very disappointed with my recent visit to this Macayo's. I had not been to a Macayo's in at least three years. I remember it being a much better experience back in those days. First off this restaurant is DIRTY. We were seated inside in one of the upper booths. One of the first things that I noticed was that the tile surrounding the booth was covered in dust. First bad sign. The second thing I noticed was that the stained glass windows beside the booth was covered in sauce splatters, ew. There was also a partial hand print in a white sauce on the side of the tile next to me double ew. Unwrapped my silverware and there was a large chunk of tomato and rice attached to my fork. Don't know how that even happens. Makes me shutter to think what they think is passable in the kitchen if they miss dried food on the utensils.  I should have probably thought twice about eating in an establishment so dirty but against my better judgment I ordered food. The chips and salsa were just okay. The chips did come out warm but the salsa was very watery. We ordered an extra side of hot salsa but our waiter continuously forgot to bring it until we had already eaten half of our meal. It was not really worth waiting for, it tasted like taco bell hot sauce. The service was bad. It started off okay but our waiter was more and more forgetful throughout the meal. I had originally ordered a fireball shot but after about fifteen minutes had gone by and no drink, my fiancé informed one of the other passing waiters that I still had not received my drink. Our waiter showed up in the mean time and asked what it was I had ordered again. He comes back five minutes later and informs me that they are out of fireball. I proceeded to order an extremely over priced $7.99 margarita (usually $8.99). It was decent.  The food. Mediocre at best. I had a Baja chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada. My fiancé had a bean burrito enchilada style. The Baja chicken enchilada was pretty good. The Baja sauce has a great flavor but I don't even want to think about how many calories a white cheese cream sauce has in it, it is a once in a few months indulgence but the other food does not make up for the calorie boat of this sauce. The cheese enchilada with red sauce was just meh. The red enchilada sauce tastes generic and too heavy. My fiancé's bean burrito was luke warm inside.   We got the bill and I had been charged for the fireball that they were out of. It was removed ten minutes later. Will not be back here. Way too many other great Mexican options in town.

Jalapeno nacho cheese sauce is all you need to know... But seriously, Fuddrucker's is quite underestimated in the realm of burgers in AZ. You hear so much about In-N-Out, The Habit, Lobby's, etc... But Fuddrucker's deserves a call out of it's own. I appreciate the cold toppings bar and the plentiful assortment of condiments. I am a sauce lover and this place has my name written all over it.  The cashier who took our order yesterday did forget to add cheese to my burger but in the end it turned out okay because to my delightful surprise, they have jalapeno nacho cheese sauce in their condiment bar!! I love cheese sauce, all of it's melty, gooey, chemical and yellow food coloring goodness lol. I also ordered sweet potato fries, not the best I have ever had but once again, the jalapeno cheese made up for this. I added grilled jalapeno's to my burger which were a spicy delight. The meat itself had a good smoky flavor to it. My fiance also very much enjoyed his burger. Overall I really would give the burger 4 out of 5 stars. They also have a plethora of other meal options. Anything from chicken sandwiches to salads to an elk burger. Many options which I am sure are great. The restaurant itself has kind of a throwback feel to it. A little bit 80's and 90's combined into one. Service was pretty good. Newer cashier who was taking our order but she was very friendly and asked for help from another associate when she had a question.  Very good experience overall. I will be back!

Had a great experience at Border Grill a couple of nights ago. We had just come from the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay so this was a convenient choice right around the corner.  We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant which was nice. It was dark but intimate and quiet. Our waiter was not the friendliest guy but he did let us know about the drink menu and the special of the night. I feel like when he found out that we were going to only get an appetizer and one entrée (two of us) his attitude got even worse.  We started with the raja potato tacos appetizer which was amazing (there are only two tacos as an appetizer so not really enough to share.) They were different than any other type of taco I have had and really a flavor explosion. I'm not sure how to explain the texture of the potato but it was almost like a mashed potato that had been fried on a hard fried tortilla with chipotle crema. It also came with guacamole and a corn salsa. I would definitely order these many times again. In fact I think I will be craving these with no way to get them :(  We also had the carne asada quesadilla. It was also delicious. The carne asada was probably the best I have ever had. The meat just melted in your mouth along with the cheese. It was a tad bit on the too salty side but the guac and sour cream countered that a  bit. Overall the flavor was great, just cut down on the salt a bit.  Overall we had a good experience. Our service was just okay. The food was great. I would come back on another visit to Vegas.

Had my first experience with a In-N-Out grilled cheese today with grilled onions. Amazing! A must try if you love cheese! Look up the secret menu online before going in to find many more tasty gems. Service was fantastic as usual. Overall great! Love me some In-N-Out!

La Casa Blanca has amazing food! Every time I have eaten here it has been good. Everything is fresh and they have fresh tortilla chips and salsa before every meal. The cheese enchilada's are very good as well as the crunchy shredded beef and shredded chicken taco's. The service has always been very good and our servers have always been attentive.   I would highly recommend this restaurant as a great authentic Mexican option in Chandler.

Got a coupon in a local flyer for $3 off and after reading the reviews thought I would give CK's a try. They did not disappoint. Came in around 5:45pm, happy to find out that they offer happy hour daily from 3pm to 7pm which is fantastic. $3 off apps and various drink specials depending on the day of the week. Monday's are $2.75 San Tan pints which made me happy.   We ordered a soft pretzel with cheese, and order of hot boneless wings and mini burger sliders. The pretzel was just okay, the wings were great especially the sauce and the sliders were amazing. The sliders are served with au jus which made me happy. Service was good and our waitress was very attentive. Also to top it all off, they have buzztime trivia which I had been hard pressed to find a place that had buzztime trivia and good food until now! So overall I am very impressed. I think this will most likely become a weekly favorite. Looking forward to trying more on the menu!

Did not have such a great experience tonight at CK's. Not sure what was going on. We have been here quite a few times in the past few months and I have come to the realization that CK's is just okay most of the time. They do a few things really well and most others not so much. I really like the original burger sliders and the pulled pork sliders. I also enjoy the boneless hot wings. Other than that, my experience has not been very good.  Service is pretty good most of the time. Tonight it took at least ten minutes after being seated to be greeted. Our waitress did apologize and she look stressed so I felt for her. We ordered the pepperjack cheese dip with tortilla chips. It was not good. It was pretty much velveeta heated up in a cup and the chips were extremely stale, tasted like they had been sitting around for at least a month in an opened bag. I ordered the french dip sandwich for my entree (see attached pic). It looked pretty good. Looks can be deceiving. It was bad. The beef tasted off. Like beef that had been sitting around too long. Very unappetizing. After two bites I was done. All of the food in general looked old and not at all fresh tonight. A huge turn off. If our dinner was this bad, how bad was the food in kitchen? Just an all around bad experience tonight.  I still gave two stars because I think that this place still has potential. I am asking that if the manager or owner read this, please take note of this experience tonight. Take a look in the kitchen and make some improvements.

Chandler Fashion Center is a good mall. Not great, not bad it's simply good. The parking is usually good even on a weekend, I recommend lower level Sears or Nordstrom parking for the least crowded. I have been visiting this mall for several years now and not much has changed which I think is a good thing. The layout is open and fairly easy to navigate much more so than Scottsdale Fashion Square. Many stores to choose from that are moderately priced. I have had good shopping experiences here pretty much every time I have been. I will be back, many times.

Dilly's Deli is right down the street from my house so I come here often on my break from work. It is a great place to get a good quality sandwich on fresh baked bread. The prices are not outrageous if you take advantage of the half sandwich with side deal for $4.79 with a drink it comes out to about $7.00. That is not bad considering the great quality of bread and deli meat that they serve. I usually order the buffalo chicken sandwich on wheat which is delicious. I had to take one star off because I used to love, love, love the chipolte cole slaw but they are no longer making it the same way. This was one of my main reasons for coming here because I loved the flavor of this cole slaw so much. They used to make it a little spicier with blended chipolte peppers but the last few times I have been here it has been bland and peppery with no chipolte. They should just call it cole slaw now. So overall I still think the quality of sandwiches is great and a pretty good price. I am a little disappointed about them changing the recipe of one of my favorite foods but I will still be coming back for the great sandwiches.

Affordable clothes that last 2-3 washings, over packed, limited size racks. You might find one size large in a sea of small and XS. You might be a small in one shirt and a large in another. Do not ever buy a pair of the pants without trying them first, if you can brave the dirty, unkempt fitting rooms. If you do attempt buying anything without trying it on, good luck with the return policy. I visited this location today on a search for some inexpensive layering tee's. I asked one associate whom was gossiping to her friend about another employee where I could locate a different size. She informed me that she could not leave "her area" and that she didn't know what sizes are left and that I should go ask the girl in the front of the store. I proceeded to the front of the store to find the tee's I was looking for strewn across a table that looked like it had been hit by a tornado. I am not expecting to get Barney's level service in a Forever 21 but come on! The only redeeming factor was that the associate at the register was friendly and asked how my day was going. He seemed at least semi-interested in providing a decent experience at the register. My suggestion, only go here if you are in need of some inexpensive accessories or layering tees and try to avoid it at all costs on a busy weekend. Best bet midweek after work.

I have been to this location of Plato's Closet a few times over the years. A few years back my sister and I would shop here on occasion if we needed a cute and inexpensive outfit for a night out. About two years ago I tried selling about 20 items in good condition (American Eagle, Calvin Klein, H&M and various other brands) and Plato's decided to buy about 6 items for $15. At the time I needed the money but I did feel like the offer was extremely low for what I had brought in.  A couple months back I brought in another 20 items in very good condition, many with tags attached or worn only once. The associates have never been very friendly here but were especially rude and unfriendly on this visit. They placed my items into a laundry basket and told me it would be about 20 minutes and they would call my name when they were ready. I briefly shopped the racks and I was surprised at the very low quality of merchandise they were selling (a couple of years back the quality was so much better). The "manager" called me back to the counter with the enthusiasm of a snail covered in salt. She offered me $12 for 8 of my items including a pair of beautiful suede Steve Madden platforms that I had previously paid very good money for. I declined and decided to take all of my items back. I would rather donate them to a good cause than give them to a store who is basically offering me $1.50 for 8 items of well known brands in great condition.  I did not see any items like the Steve Madden heels like I mentioned on their shelves. It makes me wonder if the associates working here are taking the "good" items home and leaving the rest for the customers. I usually do not write such low reviews but I really do not feel like Plato's Closet is running an honest consignment shop. The management here really needs to get it together and realize what is going on in the store. But then again maybe the management is the problem.

I work on my feet all day sometimes up to 12 hours and I am required to wear heels or wedges. I have purchased Cathy Jean shoes on and off for about three years and overall they have held up very well. I am a big fan of their classic black wedge style with a knot on the top, they have had variations of this style for years and it is very comfortable for being a 4 to 5 inch heel. I recently purchased a new pair and they definitely have a breaking in period but once they are broken in they will be fantastic, very cushioned on the arch and heel.  I have also purchased boots here which I have had one pair for two years and also taken on a trip to London and they are still looking pretty good. I will have to retire them soon (always a sad day) but I will probably go back to Cathy Jean to replace them. Prices are good and there is usually always a sale going on. Prices range from $30 to $120 and some shoes are made with all synthetic and some are made with a leather synthetic blend.  Customer service at this location on my most recent visit was very good. The cash register drawer got stuck when I needed my change but it was no big deal and the associate kept her cool. She was very helpful and had a positive attitude. Better service than I had received here in the past. They used to only have manual receipts so the fact that they have a cash register at all is an upgrade and helpful to the associates and the customer. This is a final sale store but just know that going into it. Be sure of your purchase and you will be okay. Overall good. I will be back.

Tried this location of Dilly's Deli last week and just like the other location in Chandler, it did not disappoint. This location is smaller and it was very busy at 1pm on a Tuesday. I ordered a half blazin' buffalo chicken sandwich on wheat with a side of chipolte coleslaw. The cashier who took my order was very sweet and seemed happy to be at work. Always refreshing to see a happy worker. It only cost me $6.49 for the whole meal including a small drink. Great price for a delicious lunch! Great deal in this part of town ;)  Even though it was busy, the tables were clean. My order was ready in about 5 minutes. It was delicious! Fresh baked bread, fresh lettuce, great tasting meat, what more could you ask for in a sandwich? I could literally eat that chipolte coleslaw with every meal. I highly recommend Dilly's Deli.

The memories of childhood past have mislead me. For some reason that I cannot explain I had a craving for Peter Piper Pizza last night or so I thought. I had not been to a Peter Piper in about three years and even then I had just gone in for the lunch buffet.  So we decided to go ahead and give this location a try last night. It was disappointing. We ordered a medium original crust with pepperoni and jalapeno. The crust was like cardboard. The rest just okay.  The real problem was the cleanliness of the place. I understand that along with being a pizza restaurant that this is also a children's entertainment center but I do not understand how piles of trash end up on the floor. I should have made the decision to leave after seeing the condition of the dining room but we had already ordered and I decided to give the pizza a shot.  Basically, I am worried for what the state of the kitchen looks like based on the state of the dining room. I would not suggest this location of Peter Piper Pizza. I am not sure about the others but stear clear of this one.

Writing a review for a fast food restaurant seems odd but the service at this location is really good and I think they deserve a shout out. I live near this location and I stop by when I'm in need of a quick dinner on the run. My order has always been accurate and the service has always been super friendly. The management at this Taco Bell is doing something right because the associates always seem motivated and happy. The Doritos's taco's are super tasty! Good job Taco Bell on Rural Rd!

This is a hidden gem of a discount store located at the end of a strip mall. I worry that it gets passed up because of it's location. It is definitely a store that caters more towards the mature crowd but if you look, you can find some great trendy and cute pieces here. Today I found a Max Edition (a discount line of BCBG) top and dress pants for $75 bucks. Steinmart is more organized and shoppable than Tj Maxx or Ross so that makes the experience more enjoyable.  Some of the housewares here are also very nice. I think it would be a good place to find gift items for birthdays or holidays. Customer service was good. I would definitely shop here in the future.

This Outback location is great! We live fairly close to this Outback and every time we have been here the service and food has been wonderful. I usually get a 6oz sirloin with mashed potatoes and the steak is always cooked and seasoned to perfection. I have asked for a few minor modifications such as a gravy for the mashed potatoes which they do not have but our waitress recommended the mushroom sauce usually used for steak and it was great on the mashed potatoes. The lobster mac and cheese that they recently had as a special was AMAZING! The bartender on our last visit also recommend that I put a shot of peach schnapps in my blue moon beer and once again it was AMAZING! This Outback just does it for me. I don't need to spend a fortune at a fancy steakhouse when the Outback down the street meets my every steakhouse need. Well done!

Overall I have had good experiences at this location of Sephora. Most recently I was on the hunt for a new shade of lipstick. I am jumping on the deep pigment lipstick bandwagon and I needed some advice.  I searched around a few different brands, Benefit, Bare Minerals, etc... but settled on and Urban Decay display set up in the middle of an aisle. I was trying a few of the colors and a couple of associates came by every few minutes to check to see if I needed help. It was a little a little much having two different associates hovering when I didn't need help but it wasn't over the top. I did need help at one point finding a make up removing station and one of the associates was happy to help me. When I made my way to check out I was assisted right away. It had been awhile since I had shopped at Sephora but I am part of the Beauty Insider club so I had her look up my account. My birthday is coming up soon and to my surprise I was due a birthday gift from the Beauty Insider club, Yay! Free is always best.  The Urban Decay lipstick I purchased is fantastic, I am very happy with it. The selection of makeup here is great and you can catch a lot of good sales. Join the Beauty Insider club for a free birthday gift and gifts throughout the year. Overall good experience.

Papa Murphy's pizza is delish! I am a fan. I have had pizza a couple of times from this location now and I have been impressed. You order your pizza at the register, they make your pizza (uncooked) while you wait and you take it home to bake. The ingredients look much fresher than other local delivery places and much more affordable as well. There are always coupons in the newspaper or local flyers and you can take a large pizza home for $10, $12 without a coupon. I usually order a create your own original crust with pepperoni, jalapeno and onions but they have many other great custom flavor combos as well. They have three different crust types, thin, original and pan and also a stuffed pizza option. The pizza's are very cheesy and have great flavor and come in there own bakeable tray. It's an easy, delicious and affordable dinner. The customer service is pretty good as well, everyone seems very friendly at the counter.   I will continue to eat at Papa Murphy's. Great pizza!

The pizza here is really good, no denying that. The service however, is not. My fiance and I have been here two times. Once on New Year's Eve and we ate in the restaurant which was a pretty good experience even with it being a holiday. The pizza was delicious and the service was a little slow but not bad and I give them some leeway with it being a holiday. The second time was horrible. We decided to do a carry out order for one large pizza and some wings. A pretty simple order.   We decided to wait in the restaurant and we were told it would be about fifteen minutes, no problem I didn't mind. The girl at the register had to ask two times for us to repeat the order and seemed very distracted. She did not remember to give my fiance his receipt and we had to ask her to do a reprint which she had no idea how to do. We then sat down to wait and we were patient and in no hurry. After twenty minutes had gone by my fiance went up to ask if our order would be up soon. The same girl who had no idea what was going on told us that it would be a few more minutes. A young man on a skateboard had come in and she was flirting with him and looking at his cellphone the entire twenty minutes we had been waiting.  I had noticed an ordered had been placed in the pick up window and was sitting there for about five minutes. I figured it was for someone coming in to pick up because the girl had not approached the window and knew we were sitting there waiting, all while still giggling in the corner flirting with her boyfriend. After thirty five minutes had gone by my fiance and I were very irritated especially after being told it would only be fifteen. Come to find out the pizza and wings in that to go window, were ours. My fiance asked once again where our order was and the girl looked puzzled and said, "oh what are waiting on again"?!? Really?? We've only asked you about it two times already! She finally goes to look in the pick up window which had now been sitting there for over ten minutes with no warming device. The pizza and wings were of course cold once we finally got them home. I called to speak with a manager that night and I was told there was not a manager on duty and that I would have to call the next afternoon.  I just figured forget it and that I will not be coming back here anytime soon. The pizza is great when it is warm but if the service continues to be like this they will certainly lose business. For me this is no go. At least at this point in time. Horrible customer service!

I had to write a review update because we had great experience here last Saturday. To start off my fiancé had constantly been asking me to give them another shot since our last visit because the pizza and wings were so good. I finally gave in on Saturday because I too was craving pizza and Jimmy and Joe's definitely has great pizza, it was just the service that was not so good in the past. So we got there around 6:30pm and it was rainy and cold that evening so as you could imagine, the small restaurant was packed and a very busy place.  We went to the front to place our order and a really nice, younger gentleman took our order (I didn't catch his name unfortunately). He was wearing a Disney pin lanyard which I immediately thought was awesome because I am a Disney fanatic and I too was wearing one of my pins on my jacket. We instantly connected over it. He took our order and we decided to eat in. It was quite packed inside (very small interior) but a nice couple was leaving and kindly gave us their table. As we were waiting I observed the very nice gentleman who took our order, really taking the lead and running the front service and giving pizza orders the back of the house. Finally it looks like the owner got the message and maybe hired someone who actually has got it together. This is the first time I have been in here where the restaurant actually looked like it was being managed and running smoothly especially on a busy night.  Our pizza came out, a 14 inch with green chilies, pepperoni and onion and it was absolutely delicious as usual. One thing that Jimmy and Joe's does right is pizza and now that they have service back on track it makes me a happy customer. I hope that they can hold on to the gentleman who took our order.   I will be back...

I have been to Jalapeno Inferno a couple of times now and each time has been a good experience. My fiancé and I both love very spicy food and Jalapeno Inferno delivers. The chips and salsa are very good and they have a selection of both flour and corn tortilla chips. They have a hot salsa upon request and if you prefer a very spicy experience they also have hatch chile blended salsa for a dollar charge. I had a blended cherry sangria with frozen margarita tonight which was delicious.   My fiancé had Courtney's Inferno burrito with chicken which we were told is the spiciest option on the menu. The enchilada sauce that it is covered in is made with blended hatch chiles and other spices. It was very good. I had the skillet chicken with hatch chiles and onions mixed with a queso sauce. It came with corn tortillas and sour cream. It was great! It was almost fajita style because I wrapped the skillet chicken in the corn tortilla with rice and beans and loaded it up with spicy salsa. Yum!  The service was a little slow tonight but not bad. Our waitress was very warm and friendly. She did forget that my sangria was on half off special but quickly resolved the issue. Overall good experience. I will be back!

Yet another great experience at Jalapeno Inferno today. Came in around 4:30, right before the Sunday dinner rush. Service was great, our waitress was friendly and attentive. We were promptly served delicious flour tortilla chips which are dangerously good. Tonight I ordered the blood orange margarita which was tart and delicious.  I had a sampler platter tonight which included a corn tamale, mini fundido's, a green chile quesadilla and queso w/ spinach. Everything was absolutely delicious. I ate way too much because it was oh so good! My fiance had the queso skillet chicken which was amazing as usual. The ambiance is also really nice here and it was a beautiful day to have the patio open with a nice breeze.  Overall I am very impressed with Jalapeno Inferno. I will be back to try more!  (Going to try the lobster taco's on the next visit)

We have been to King's Fish House a few times before and it has always been pretty good. My mom wanted to go here for Mother's Day so my sister booked a reservation. After our entire party arrived (party of 5) we were promptly seated in a nice booth by the lobster tank. Our waiter Andrew arrived shortly after and took our drink orders. Drink orders were out quickly and all seemed to be going pretty well.  The food is where I had a problem. I ordered charbroiled scallops and my mom had the same I also got macaroni and cheese and corn as sides. My fiancé got the sirloin cooked medium with baked potato as he isn't much of a seafood lover. The food came out in a fair amount of time. When I took the first bite of one of my scallops it was okay but it seemed kind of gritty which is not very appetizing. The second one was chewy on the side and so rubbery that I had to spit it out. I was pretty turned off on the scallops at this point. The mac and cheese was dry and seemed reminiscent of cafeteria mac and cheese which is much different than the experience I had the last time we were here. The last time we ate at King's I had a separate side of mac and cheese brought out and the noodles were nicely cooked and the cheese was great. This time, overcooked noodles, not much cheese and dry. The corn was decent. My fiancé had the sirloin and this is not a cheap sirloin by any means. It was not cooked medium and just did not have much flavor. No seasoning and pretty fatty and not in a good way. His baked potato was dry as the Sahara desert even with butter and cheese, it looked like it had been in the oven for an hour too long.  We should have asked for a manager and sent our food back but it was Mother's Day and my mom was enjoying her time. I didn't want to be the pain at the table sending back food. For the price that we paid for this meal it was not in any way worth it. I would not come back after this experience.  Our waiter Andrew was also very frazzled and almost forgot to charge us for part of the meal. He did not come back very often to refill drinks. I understand that it was very busy and I do cut him some slack but he's got to be able to handle a high business restaurant if that is his job.  Overall very disappointed. Based on this experience with the food I would not recommend King's Fish House.

Stopped here tonight for the first time. Wow. Good food. Good drinks. I had the bangers and mash which were not your typical English fare. They come on top of poblano pepper mashed potatoes with a green Chile gravy and Southwest style corn. Amazing! So good I would have taken a whole jar of the green Chile gravy home.   My fiance had the Hamberguesa which is the (as you guessed it) spicy Mexican spin on their burger. I tried a bite which was delicious. Crispy jalapenos on top along with red pepper aioli, yum. The meat itself also had a great flavor.  I also had the Strawberry Marilyn Monroe Mojito which was so good. It was a combo of strawberry vodka, Mr. Pineapple beer, champagne and OJ. While I wouldn't really call that a mojito because of the lack of rum, after two or three I don't care what I would call it. If I become a regular here (which I plan to) I will simply start referring to it as the triple M with strawberry. Strawberry Marilyn Monroe Mojito is simply to many words.  Service was good despite it being a busy Saturday evening. I will be back.

I love Whole Foods. Fresh organic veggies, amazing butcher and meat selection, beer and wine from around the world and so much more. The cost is high but the products are so worth it. Recently I have discovered an amazing new healthy "junk" food in the form of Kale Krunch which is a packaged Kale chip in a variety of flavors, I highly recommend it.   The hot and cold food bar has quite the selection with anything from baked tilapia to marinated artichokes and beyond. If you have any questions on any of the items of the day the friendly associates will be happy to help. I have also stopped by the juice/coffee bar and have had great experiences at both.  If you have any sort of allergy or dietary need, Whole Foods will be able to fulfill it. Gluten free, vegan, vegetarian, peanut allergy, soy allergy, you name Whole Foods has got the food to suit your needs.  Overall, great store. It is a once in a while indulgence because of the price but it is so worth it.

I love Fresh and Easy! It truly lives up to it's namesake. Cooking for two is not always a simple task because it's seems as though everything these days is made for four or more. Fresh and Easy has many healthy, prepackaged meals for two ready to make for the evening.  I like the selection of free range chicken and beef at a reasonable price as well as whole grain bread and tortillas. Sometimes I just need a healthy meal that is ready to make at the end of a busy work day and I know that Fresh and Easy will have it. They also have a great selection of imported wines and beer at great prices and a pretty knowledgeable staff on the different options.  I really hope that Fresh and Easy does not close as rumored but on my last visit I spoke with one of this associates on this matter and she reassured me that this location would not be closing anytime soon. I sure hope not! I shop here often and will continue to do so.

Firehouse Subs is delicious. You really can't go wrong here. Fresh bread, good quality cold cuts and melt in your mouth cheese. I have recently discovered the New York Steamer which is pastrami and corned beef with provolone and Italian dressing all melted together. It goes especially well with a nice chipotle sauce from the great selection of hot sauces from the counter and also some nice crunchy jalapeno kettle chips.   The special choose from a bunch o' drinks coke machine is pretty cool too, although I get a little overwhelmed and never know what I want. Service has always been great and the tables are always clean even when it's busy. The best time to come during the week is 2pm-3pm to avoid the crazy lunch or dinner rush. Overall Firehouse is delicious, I will be back.

Surprisingly had a good experience at this Red Lobster today. The last couple of times I have been to a Red Lobster have been disappointing to say the least but this experience was much better. I feel as though this location has it together, from customer service to food quality, they get it.  My sister and I arrived around 5:30 this evening. We were seated right away and needed a high chair as we had my baby niece with us as well. We were seated at a very nice table in the back and we were kindly given a high chair with no problem. Our waiter, while he seemed new and a bit nervous was very nice and he was very prompt with service. My sister and I both ended up ordering the same thing off of the crabfest menu which was a sirloin topped with lump crab meat and green beans. We both ordered our steaks medium rare. They came out perfectly cooked, juicy, and the crab gave them a great amount of flavor.  Overall our visit today was very good. Service was good, food was very good, I was slightly shocked at how impressed I was with this Red Lobster. I had pretty much given up on them but we were both in the mood for seafood and there are not a lot of options in Mesa but I was pleasantly surprised tonight. Kudos Red Lobster, you might have won back a skeptic...

I have been to this location two times now. The sushi has been good and the service so so. The happy hour prices are good and the Ra'kin shrimp is amazing. Our waitress disappeared for about fifteen minutes at one point but overall my experience here has been pretty good. The spicy lobster roll is great as well as the las Vegas roll. For Arizona "desert" sushi this place is pretty darn good.

San Tan Village is a great mall. The parking can be a little hectic especially if you get caught up in the heart of the pedestrian area but if you just park on the outskirts by one of the anchor stores it's not bad at all. The mall is layed out nicely with wide open walkways and misters when it's hot. Recently I have taken my baby niece to the splash pad and play area which are both great for the little ones. The mall is kept very clean and there are plenty of spots to sit down and relax. Lots of great stores to choose from including higher end and also your average mall stores. It of course gets a quite hot in the summer and is much more enjoyable in the fall/winter months but would not be bad to stop by if you had a specific store in mind in the summer. There are also multiple great restaurants to try including, Kona Grill, Blue Wasabi, and Cantina Laredo to name just a few.  Overall San Tan Village is nice outdoor venue for walking around and enjoying the day. I will be back!

Tried Brio for the first time tonight. It was good. I very much enjoyed my dinner and the atmosphere. Came in around 6:15pm and we were seated right away. Our waitress was attentive and got our drinks out quickly. I tried the berry acai Italian soda which was just okay, I probably would not get it again.  The bread that was brought out before our entrees was very good. A combination of sourdough and a crispy baked focaccia type cracker bread. My sister and I both had Caesar salads before our meal and they were great. I ordered the pasta fra diavolo which had campanelle pasta with a spicy vodka cream sauce and chicken. I asked for it extra spicy and it was delicious. My sister had the ravioli di bello which was a portabella mushroom ravioli with a mushroom cream sauce, I tried it and it was also very tasty.   Service was great throughout the meal. Food was wonderful. Prices are moderate but worth it. Overall good. I will be back.

Oh In N Out how I love thee. Your burgers are fresh and your service is great. I don't get weird looks when I order a double double protein style with onion and extra mustard, just a smile and a what else can I get for you? Yesterday service was particularly good and the nice gentleman that took our order came around to make sure that we were doing good. He was friendly and made good conversation. The burgers taste great and I will keep coming back for more. In N Out does it right. Keepin it real, keepin it simple, it works!

Had a great experience at Sweet Tomatoes a couple of days ago. Great customer service from start to finish. For $14 you get all you can eat salad bar, soup and an assortment of pastas and breads as well as a dessert bar. You start at the salad assembly line and build your salad as you go. Everything looked very fresh and they had someone constantly replacing the salad components which I thought was nice.  We seated ourselves at a booth and after our first round of soup and salad we had someone come over right away and ask if we needed our table cleared. I had a question about one of the tea's that they had available and someone came right over to help me out. The food was not the best I have had but it was fresh and I enjoyed my dinner. The customer service here is great and they have many healthy options. I would definitely come back in the future.

I have been to this location of Texas Roadhouse a few times and it has always been pretty good. I came here a couple of nights ago because they were donating 10% of the proceeds of your bill to the families of the Yarnell Hill firefighters which I thought was a great cause and my family loves this restaurant.  We had a party of six and we were promptly seated. We were served warm rolls and drinks right away which was great. I ordered a house margarita and it was good and came out really fast. I ordered a sirloin cooked medium and it was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. Everyone else at the table was very pleased with their meal. Our service was also top notch. In classic Texas Roadhouse fashion there were a few birthday's in the house with loud Yeehaw's but it was not near as bad as my prior experience at a different location at Texas Roadhouse.  Overall this restaurant has quality steaks at a good price. A good option for those in the Queen Creek/ east Gilbert area with limited restaurant options. I will be back.

I stopped here for lunch today with my sister and had a decent experience. This wasn't our first choice because Outback and Carraba's were not yet open and this was the next closest option and we were hungry. We were seated right away and our server came right over. Our drink orders were taken and came out very quickly along with rolls and butter.  I ordered a southwest style chicken salad (I can't remember the exact name on the menu) but it had blackened chicken, tortilla strips, black beans and corn and I ordered ranch on the side. I was very tasty and the chicken was seasoned well and tasted great. Our waiter was very attentive and gave great service. My sister had the soup of the day which was the baked potato soup and said it was great.   I would give this place another try for dinner. A steak or burger could be a much different experience than a salad so I may have more to report on a different occasion. Overall good first impression.

Came to The Mission recently for our company holiday party and had an amazing experience. From the ambiance to the service to the food, everything was top notch. I was the first to arrive in our party of six. We had a reservation on a very busy Sunday evening and the table was ready and waiting for us in the back of the restaurant. I was greeted right away by our waiter. He came over and took my drink order and brought it out very quickly.  I was able to have a good look at the menu before the rest of the party arrived and good thing that I did because everything looked and sounded so good. When the rest of my party arrived, we decided to get table side guacamole and it was very fresh and delicious. I decided on the short rib tacos and a side of street corn for my entree and both were extremely good. The short rib was melt in your mouth good and the three tacos were perfectly sized. The street corn was served in a spicy chipolte sauce and I could have eaten it for days. I also asked if they had a spicer salsa and our waiter said that he could bring me out a sauce made with ghost chile. I went for it because I LOVE spicy. I knew to use it sparingly and it gave me the zip I was looking for to both my corn and tacos. Two of the people in my party were vegetarians and ordered the butternut squash tacos and absolutely loved them as well.  The manager/owner also came around to our table to see how we liked our dinner. I though that it was a great personal touch. He was very nice and attentive. Our service was outstanding.  I will definitely be coming back here soon. That street corn is enough to bring me back for sure and I would love to try many other items on the menu. Highly recommended.

unPhogettable will be unforgettable for me (at least for good pho in the Chandler/Mesa general area). Came here with a friend on a busy Sunday afternoon. Service was pretty good. They forgot our drink order for awhile but once we reminded them (I say them because we had multiple table servers) our drinks were brought out right away.  I had the Bun Bo Hue which is a little different from the traditional pho on the menu. It has the thicker rice noodles instead of the skinnier pho noodles. It has a very strong spicy beef flavor with a darker broth. The flavor was delicious. Some might find this flavor too strong so I would recommend going with the traditional pho flavors on the front page of the menu if you are a beginning pho connoisseur. My friend and I also started with shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce which were also delicious.  Sometimes all you need is a delicious, spicy, hearty bowl of soup and pho always hits the spot for me. UnPhogettable does it well.

You know that look you get from a waitress when you order something off of the menu that they think might be questionable? Well, I got that look tonight. I met my sister on the patio around 5:30. The patio is small but nice if it's not too busy. Stephanie was our waitress and she was very sweet, she had a great personality and I would definitely give her more like four out five stars but the food not so much. They do have a good happy hour on Monday and Tuesday nights from 2pm to 8pm so I will give them that. The app selection on the happy hour menu is quite slim however. We did decided to get the pretzels with cheese, the cheese is $2 extra which I honestly think is kind of ridiculous because pretzels and cheese should be a given. They were not bad, not great but honestly I could get a pretzel that is a million times better and much bigger a few feet down the way at a particular brewing co...  On to the entrees. My sister had asked before I had arrived what the waitress suggested off of the menu. She suggested the fish and chips hands down. I should have also heeded this advice but I was kind of craving a burger so I decided to take a chance and order one. I should have known right away that it would not be what I wanted when Stephanie told me that they did not have american cheese. I am an american cheese burger type of girl, cheddar just doesn't cut it for me. The look on our waitress's face when I ordered the burger was one of disdain. I know that she did not purposely mean to make the face but she did. I honestly wish she would have told me not to order it. It was not good, it was very bad in fact. Dry, tasteless, overcooked meat with a semi hard bun. I should have sent it back but I instead decided to suffer through half of it which is retrospect and a stomach ache later, was a bad idea. I did eat most of the sweet potato fries that came with the burger with the $2 cheese sauce that was left over from the pretzel. It didn't make up for the disappointing burger. My sister did enjoy her fish and chips and the tarter sauce did look good as well.  Overall I have come to the conclusion that this is a restaurant/pub that is very hit or miss when it comes to food. If you want to come here to drink and have an appetizer or two you might enjoy your visit more. If you come here to eat dinner, by all means do not get a burger and I would also suggest to avoid the sliders. Honestly, you can find a much better meal a few steps down the sidewalk. Most likely will not return. Stephanie, you did your best with the hand you were given.

I used to really like Red Lobster. After many sub par experiences at different locations over the last couple of years I have come to the conclusion that Red Lobster is going downhill fast. Today I met my sister here for lunch around 1:30pm. We were seated right away but it took our waiter about 15 minutes to approach the table. We eventually got our drinks after asking twice.   I looked over the lunch menu and they definitely had some new items since the last time I had dined with Red Lobster about six months ago. The lobster grilled cheese and shrimp salad sandwich were among the odd choices on the lunch menu. I went with the staple grilled shrimp house salad with a cup of clam chowder soup, my sister had fried shrimp and scallops. The food took at least 30 minutes to be served which I thought was quite ridiculous for a lunch service especially for some salad, soup and fried food. My clam chowder was mediocre at best, tasted like it came out of a can for sure and the grilled shrimp in my salad still tasted half frozen. My sister did enjoy her fried shrimp, maybe fried is the way to go at Red Lobster because clearly fresh is not the top priority here.  Overall bad. Service was just mediocre. Food was bad. I will not be back anytime soon.

My fiance and I had a great experience at M Resort last weekend. We stayed in a deluxe room with a strip view for three nights. We had a room at the end of the hallway which was nice on the sixth floor. The room was very clean and I was impressed right from the start. The bath tub with the window was amazing. The room felt very luxurious for the price. The bed was soft but very comfortable. The pillows were too soft for my taste but overall still comfortable.  The front desk agents were all very nice and were able to give us a later check out free of charge. The only downfall that I would say was the marquee rewards host that signed us up. He did not explain any of the benefits of the card and seemed annoyed to be at work. The resort has 4 restaurants and a large buffet. We did not try the buffet and we are sad we missed it. We looked at all of the offerings on the last day but didn't go for it, we should have.  This resort is about a 15 minute drive on the I-15 to the strip so be prepared for that. It was not bad at all in my opinion. I enjoyed being away from the strip at night, it kept our stay very quiet. We were able to enjoy the strip and still come back to the room to relax.  I would recommend this hotel if you have the ability to drive back and forth to the strip. If you are trying to get close to the strip this is not the resort for you. I had a great experience here and I would definitely come back.

I used to live in Queen Creek and I would frequent this location often. It has always been just okay but this visit was pretty bad.  I met my sister here for lunch and I got there a little bit before her. I sat down in the patio area around 12:30. It was not very busy and I found a table near the outside bar. I figured I could get a drink and a couple of menus before my sister arrived but I sat there for fifteen minutes without ever being acknowledged. Once my sister got there it took at least another ten minutes before anyone ever came to the table. We finally got some menus and our waitress brought our drinks right out and she did apologize for the wait. In all fairness our waitress was really nice and did make sure our drinks were refilled but I'm not sure if the slowness was on the kitchen side or on her side. We ordered our food, I ordered a blackend chicken salad and my sister ordered a meatball sub.  It took a full half hour for our food to arrive. At one point our waitress came out joking that she ate the food so they had to make another one. I know that she was trying to make light of it taking so long but it was still a little frustrating. We were in no hurry but still this is way to long for a salad and a sandwich to come out. Once we got our food it was just okay. The blackened chicken in my salad was really tasty but the fat free ranch that they serve is horrible, I would recommend anything but this dressing. My sister did like her meatball sub but it was a bit on the greasy side.  I do like the atmosphere of the outside patio and the friendly vibe of this restaurant. I think that the quality of food could be a little better as well as the efficiency of service. My family lives out this way so I will probably visit this location again because it is one of their favorites but I might just stick to drinks and chips and salsa next time.

Today I had my first massage ever and it was amazing! My sister had purchased a package deal with Elements and had three massages to give away to friends and I was one of the lucky recipients. While it is true as some of the others have written on here that Elements does not have over the top amenities, I felt very comfortable here from the moment I walked in. They had lemon water sitting on the coffee table in the waiting room along with cookies. They also had a book with the bio's of all of the massage therapists which I thought was a very nice personalized touch.   I filled out some paperwork and within a few minutes my massage therapist, Teresa came to get me. She asked me a little bit about the different areas that were bothering me and made me feel comfortable and cared for. I was a little tense when she started my massage but I was able to relax after a few moments. She focused a lot of her time on my hips and feet which are my problem areas and she applied just the right amount of pressure. She also did an awesome job releasing the tension in my neck and shoulders. The room was very comfortable and if anything it was a little chilly which I didn't mind because I get hot easily and the coolness of the room felt good.  After my massage Teresa met me in the hallway and gave me some information on Epsom salts and aromatherapy which was really great. She also brought me a cold bottle of water. She did mention the massage package deal but only in passing and I did not at all feel pressured. I stopped at the desk to leave a tip and they did ask me if I wanted to re-book and I chose not to at this time but I still did not feel any pressure from the receptionist. Overall in comparison to other package deal type of places I did not feel the least bit of pressure from Elements. Just for this fact I will definitely be back. I think that this is how it should be. Keep the low pressure feeling in place and you will get many more re-books.  I will be back to see Teresa. I think I just found one of my new favorite escapes.

Sandella's has a great selection of tasty and healthy flatbread options. Today I tried the buffalo chicken grilled flatbread which was very good and I've also had the Brazilian chicken wrap and the margharita flatbread which was great. The Brazilian sauce is unique and has a very Caribbean jerk flare to it. I also like that Sandella's has calorie information posted and that the nutritional value of menu items is easy to find online. It is a little on the pricy side but no more than you would pay at Chipolte or Firehouse Subs. The customer service is great and I have never had a bad experience here. The only reason I did not give five stars is because sometimes I have found the flatbreads to be a little dry and lacking in the sauce department but I'm sure it all depends on who makes it. Overall great place for lunch and I will be back.

This location of Harkins at San Tan Mall is nice. It is your average Harkins movie theater, they all pretty much have the same lay out inside and out. Customer service has been good every time I have come here. I rarely get concessions but if I do I get either a free small cup of water or purchase a Dasani water bottle. The associates are always very nice if I ask for a free cup of water. The theater that we were last in was fairly clean. Not the cleanest I've ever seen but nothing to detract from my movie going experience. I have noticed the last few times I have been to a movie, they have amped up the amount of times the security does their rounds. It is mildly distracting when the security guard passes up and down the aisle and in front of the screen multiple times but at the same time I do appreciate them preventing texting and obnoxious kids/moviegoers.   Overall Harkins theaters are always a good movie going experience.This location in particular is very nice and I will continue getting my movie on in the blazing inferno that is Phoenix.

Visited this Petco today while I was out this way. The store layout is pretty nice and it was clean and organized. I was greeted when I walked in door.  I picked up a few items and headed to the cash register. Two lanes seemed to be open and one cashier was having an issue with a coupon ringing. The other cashier (presumably a manager) stopped what she was doing at her register without explanation to the guest she was helping and went to help the other cashier. Once that was resolved and the cashier that was presumably the manager was done ringing her customer I headed over to her lane. She said, oh I'm closed. meanwhile I was lugging a 20lb cat litter back and forth to the register. I went to get back in line to the other register while the cashier that had just told me she was closed was just standing there staring around. This is not in any way good customer service. There were also two other associates with the door open to a break room around the corner laughing a messing around in the doorway.   I was the only person in line waiting to be assisted and it probably took a good ten minutes or more just to be rung up for two items. The only redeeming factor was that the cashier who rung me up was very nice especially considering that she was the only one who seemed to really be working. Get it together Petco. Your competition is right across the street.

I had my car repaired at Family Auto Care recently and had a pretty good experience. I read the reviews on Yelp (of course) before taking Theo in. Theo's power steering had randomly and instantly gone out on me one night while driving home. I try to take good care of my car and I instantly felt that drop in my stomach when my wheel took the strength of ten men to turn.  I was able to use some power steering fluid and temporarily repair the leak and limp Theo to Family Auto Care. I had spoken with Cassandra before taking him in and she sounded very friendly and assured me that my car(Theo) would be well taken care of.   I dropped Theo off on a Friday and was called on Tuesday to let me know he was ready. Cassandra had given me an estimate before the repair that was very accurate and I did not feel overcharged or hassled. The only reason I knocked one star off is because once I got Theo back the AC was suddenly not working. I knew that it was certainly working before I dropped my car off.  I called Family Auto Care to let them know that my AC was not working and Cassandra told me to bring my car in whenever was convenient for me. I brought Theo back on a Thursday afternoon and they took him right back. Turns out an O-ring had been broken while repairing the power steering panel. Family Auto Care repaired it no questions asked and took care of it without a problem. I would recommend them to anyone looking for an honest auto repair location in Chandler. They are also located in downtown Chandler which is home to many of the best local eateries which is great if you are waiting on a repair.

I haven't been to Old Navy in who knows how long but my sister was looking for baby clothes and decided to stop in this location today. I was impressed by the organization of the store. Working in retail myself, I understand that it can be difficult to maintain a big box store such as Old Navy. The racks were easily shoppable and neatly organized, well done management team and associates.  We shopped the baby and toddler clothes department but didn't find very many options. My sister found a cute maternity top on sale and I was impressed with the selection of maternity jeans. On our way out I wasn't really looking but I found a really nice vintage inspired ACDC tee for my fiance. I was very happy with this find.  The cashier who helped my sister and I was very nice. She was cheerful and seemed like a very happy and positive person who was very pleasant. I would definitely shop here again. For basic tees, jeans, dresses who knows, but the customer service and organization on this visit was top notch.

I use this Wells Fargo for business banking and I have always had great customer service here. Sometimes the lines can get long but that is the case with any bank. The thing that sets this location apart from others is the customer service reps who come and ask if they can get you water or coffee while you wait. The tellers are all extremely friendly and it really makes me think that whoever manages this branch is doing a really good job. Overall I really enjoy my experience at this location of Wells Fargo and if it was not so much of a hassle with my other bank, I might consider switching my personal accounts over to this location as well.

Went to RigaTony's a few nights ago with the fiancé after receiving a $50 gift card for Christmas. It was very busy around 6:45pm and the wait was going to be about 20 minutes. We saw that there were a few booths in the bar area and asked the hostess if these happened to be open seating. To our surprise, they were! It was actually very cozy in the bar area and had a very romantic feel to it.   The booths in the bar area were perfect for two and we were greeted right away. We asked our waitress a recommendation on wine and she suggested the Moscato. My fiancé decided to have a glass of this and I decided to try the sangria flight which included, apple, basil and berry. The Italian Moscato that my fiancé had was amazing and had just the right amount of sweet to it. The sangria flight was just okay. I would not get it again. the apple was the best by far but the basil one was kind of odd and the berry was way too sweet. We decided on our order and he got the baked lasagna and I got the baked Rigatony, which consisted of Italian sausage with marina and alfredo sauce baked on top of penne pasta. Both of our meals were delicious. We were also served a great Italian salad before the meal which was served with an Italian vinaigrette and pieces of salami on top. It was delicious and I was impressed that this came with our meals.   To top it all off we finished with a bowl of spumoni. It was delicious and the pistachio was my favorite. Service was fantastic, even in the bar area. She made sure we always had everything we needed and brought us a loyalty card at the end of meal and if you come in 6 times, you get your 7th meal free. Overall our visit here was great. We will be back.

Oh how I love this store! Let me count the ways! Color coded jewelry selection, cute outfits with accessory suggestions, purses, boots, sandals, and sunglasses oh my!  I have purchased many gifts here and every time I go in for a gift I come out with three or four items of my own as well. I could probably spend two to three hours in this store if I had unlimited money and time. Yesterday I was emailed a coupon informing me about BOGO free clearance sale. I could not resist. I was in the area already and Charming Charlie was calling my name (more like screaming it.) I am headed to San Diego soon and I needed some cute beach accessories.  I found three beautiful necklaces and a set of earrings all for $15! I could have kept going and going but I had to stop myself eventually. The customer service was great yesterday as well. I was greeted upon entering the store and I informed the associate I was here for the sale, she directed me towards it and told me everything was buy one get one free on sale and joked with me that she would think I was crazy if I left empty handed. When I went to check out, my cashier was extremely pleasant and signed me up for the birthday club and shopper rewards.  I love this store. I will be back many times!!

This location of Francesca's is great! I am a big fan of quirky, fun and unique clothing pieces and Francesca's usually has what I am in search of. In addition to cute clothes, I can usually find fun accessories, household items, ornaments and home decor, what more could you ask for?  I have had great customer service every time I have been in this store and the associates are very willing to help find what you are looking for. Wow did that all just rhyme? Crazy. Anyhow, I love this store. Kind of like a less expensive but still great version of Anthropologie.

My fiance and I dined here last night and we were very disappointed. When we first walked in the door we were not greeted even though the hostess was standing at the entrance. She seemed very distracted and it took her about five minutes to even notice that we were there. Once we were seated it took probably another ten minutes before anyone ever took our drink order or introduced themselves. Eventually a woman came over, I still do not know her name because she did not introduce herself and she said she was a manager and would be taking our order because our server was running behind.  I ordered the penne with marinara and alfredo sauce with chicken which was a recommendation from the manager that took our order. My fiance had the lasagna. It took about fifteen minutes for our food to come out which wasn't bad but it was horrible once we started eating. The chicken in my penne dish was rubbery and tasted freezer burned and days old. Definitely not cooked fresh. The lasagna that my fiance had seemed like something that had been frozen for months and then quickly heated up in the microwave. I wanted to send my dish back but once again there was no server to be found. My fiance had to eventually ask the bartender to find a manager. Ten minutes later we finally had someone over to our table. I told her that the chicken was really bad and that I would like something else. I ended up just getting the garlic and brown butter sauce on spaghetti. It was not to bad but pretty bland and nothing to write home about. Overall the service was really lacking and the food was terrible. The only thing that I enjoyed was the Italian cream soda and the bread which isn't saying much.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you are around Chandler Mall waiting to see a movie, go to BJ's or California Pizza Kitchen. Much better service and food.

I am a fan of Olive Garden's unlimited soup and salad lunch and I had a very good experience today at this location. I was surprised at how busy the restaurant was at 11:30am on a Saturday afternoon but hey they must be doing something right.  My sister and I were seated right away and our server was very nice and brought drinks and salad very quickly. We ordered Zuppa Toscana and as always it was hot and delicious. Overall good experience. I would definitely come back for lunch.

We had been referred to Spinato's by multiple friends over the last few months but hadn't made it over this way until now. It did not disappoint. The wait was about thirty minutes on a Friday night at 6:00pm but that was to be expected. We were seated in about 25 minutes.   My fiancé and I had heard rave reviews about the Mamma Spinato's Spinach Pizza beforehand so it was between this or a create your own. We settled on the Mamma Spinato's to try something different. It consisted of a thin crust with tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella and I ordered half with jalapenos for a bit of a kick. It was fantastic! Great flavor. It was a little heavy on the spinach but it did not over power the pizza completely. The sauce here is fantastic and I would like to now try other flavors of pizza for comparison. We also had some hot boneless buffalo wings with ranch which were pretty good, not great but good.   I had ordered a "Snakebite" drink from the bar menu. It was a nitro milk dark beer combined with Crispin hard cider. It was DELICIOUS. Highly recommend this. I am a dark brew kind of girl and this really hit the spot. It was the perfect combination of bitter and sweet. Really good. Also very good selection of beer on tap.  Overall very good experience. Service was a little slow but they were busy and I will give him the benefit of the doubt. I will be back to try more.

Tried Coach and Willie's for the first time today after hearing rave reviews from friends about the different kinds of mac and cheese. I sat out on the patio and waited to meet my sister for lunch. I was greeted right away and drinks were brought out quickly. They have a nice assortment of lunch choices on the lunch menu. I decided to side salad and a cup of the green chile mac and cheese. It was delicious! Breadcrumbs and cojita cheese on top and creamy and hot on the inside. The green chiles add just the right amount of spice for me. My sister had the lobster bisque and the bacon mac and cheese and loved both.   They definitely have some other great looking menu options that I will try out in the future. The reviews on here are mixed but I will definitely give them another try after the good experience today. I will also be back to sample the bar menu. Overall good experience.

I was in need of somewhat of a hair transformation and today I got just that at Flict. I had a coupon for $50 off a color, cut and style from a local flyer and I decided to look up the reviews and they were great!   They are located off of Ray and Dobson next to the Valle Luna restaurant next to the lake. I was greeted right away when I walked in and I loved the vintage decor. Rachel greeted me within a few minutes and took me to her chair. I had lightened my hair to platinum a few days ago with the intent of going to a more honey blonde. Rachel did a very extensive consultation with me to understand exactly what color and style I was going for. When we decided on a color she took me to the bowl to rinse my hair. She was very sweet and we made great conversation, which we all know is a also a very important attribute in a hairstylist. The color probably only took about 30 minutes in total which wasn't too bad at all.  When the color was revealed I was beyond happy. It is stunning! A perfect honey golden blonde. She cut my hair in to a shoulder length layered bob and it looks gorgeous and healthy again. She was also training another stylist at the time and is very knowledgeable and really knows her stuff! I would definitely recommend her and  I will definitely be going back. See pics :)0

Went here last night and had a great experience. Courtnie was our waitress and was courteous, prompt and very nice. We were seated in the back of the restaurant around 6pm. It was nice because it was a little quieter and it seemed like we had a private little table in the back.  We had the soft pretzel with beer cheese fondue sauce. It was great. The cheese was just the right consistency and had a little bit of a horseradish kick to it. I had a house salad with peppercorn ranch dressing, a little stingy on the dressing but man was it good. My fiancé had the jalapeno burger with chipotle aioli. It was phenomenal. We split it. It had Tabasco onion strings that gave it the right amount of crisp with a nicely cooked burger. Very tasty.  The entire meal was great. The beer was great. They had Kilt lifter for $4 on Tuesday nights so that made me happy. Service was great.  I Will be back!

My fiancé and I have been back to this restaurant several times since my last review and it has been good every time. The service has been hit or miss but the food has been fantastic every time we have dined here. We are both creatures of habit and this restaurant has definitely become a habit. The soft pretzels with fondue cheese, delish, the jalapeno pepper jack burger amazing!   The beer specials vary from day to day. The music which they play also varies, I recommend Tuesday nights which is classic rock and Kilt Lifter, a great combination. We sometimes come here just for beer and apps but sometimes we go all out and order entrees. Food consistency has been great. Courtnie is one of the best waitresses, ask for her section.  I will be returning!

I have eaten at this location a few times recently and it has been a good experience each time. I usually order the #11 Country Club which is delicious! The Jimmy chips are crunchy and have great flavor. No matter how busy it has been when I have been in this location they get my sub out within 5 minutes or less. Great! I only wish that they had a few other pepper options, jalapeno's, green peppers etc... But then again the simplicity makes Jimmy John's fast and delicious!  I will be back!

Great subs! I recently discovered this gem of a sub shop while having my car repaired down the street. The bread is soft and hot, the meat is fresh and tasty and the veggies are crisp. I have had their featured specialty sub simply called "The Experience" two times now and both times it has been amazing. It has a combination of chicken, jalapenos, banana peppers, cream cheese and bacon, everything is better with bacon, especially this sub. They also have a student meal deal with one of the basic subs such as turkey or ham and cheese with chips and a drink for $5 which I may take advantage of because I am a student at CGCC down the road. The subs are all toasted and they have a wide variety of options including vegetarian and seafood. I will be coming back to this sub shop quite often. Now I want a sub...

Phenomenal! Great experience today at Postino. I had been wanting to try the bruschetta here after hearing rave reviews from many of my friends and it did not disappoint. Met my sister and mom here for an antipasti lunch and everything was delicious. We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant. Water was served pretty much the moment we sat down which was great. Everyone working here seemed to be very happy and upbeat. We started off with one waitress who took our wine order and gave us some nice suggestions. I think she must have been transitioning shifts because another gentleman (presumably a manager) came out and took our food order. A few minutes later another waitress introduced herself and said she was taking over but even through all of that transition, wine was promptly served, food came out quickly and it all went smoothly. Waitress number three was with us the rest of the time and she was really nice and attentive.  For $14 you get a choice of four bruschetta's. We chose the apple and brie with fig, artichoke spread, fontina with bacon and tomato and salami with pesto. All were very good. The apple and brie with fig is very sweet so I liked saving that one for the end. We also order the soft pretzels with chorizo and white cheddar, it came out served with a variety of pickles, nuts and mustard and was delish! I am a girl who likes a combination of textures so this was very appealing. Everything was great. Atmosphere was relaxing for the lunch hour. Service was great. $5 wine from 11am-5pm.   I spotted someone noshing on a salted caramel sundae before leaving and I felt quite sad that I did not indulge in one of those. It gives me an excuse to come back. I will be back!

Came here yesterday for an Easter Day Mexican brunch. Great experience overall. The first thing I noticed here was the awesome patio. We didn't sit outside on this visit but it would definitely be a patio I would return to for happy hour to enjoy the nice fountain and a fire pit in the fall and winter.  Rodrigo was our waiter and he was great. Very accommodating and thoroughly explained the menu. They had a Sunday brunch menu (from 10am to 4pm) in addition to the regular menu. After looking over both menus I was having a hard time deciding because of so many great sounding options. I really wanted to try the Chilaquiles with huevos ranchero but ultimately decided on the papas with chipolte crema and chorizo. I also ordered a mimosa ($3 on Sunday brunch special). My fiance ordered a grilled chicken burrito smothered with red sauce and a vampiro taco which consisted of carne asada and chipolte sauce. I absolutely loved my papas (see picture)!! They were cooked perfectly with bacon and chorizo and the chipolte crema is delicious. It is enough food to feed about 4 people so be aware of that. I have leftovers for days which I don't mind. My fiance's chicken burrito was also delicious. The red sauce was very tomato based and tasted great, clearly house made.   There are many other menu items I would love to try here and I will definitely be returning to try more. They do have a taco with the ghost chili which I will give a try in the future. I think I will definitely be returning on a Sunday afternoon again because there are so many things on the brunch menu that I need to sample including shrimp and crab cakes benedict. The service was great and overall we had a great experience. I will be going back!!

I really enjoy shopping at Francesca's. I was here over the weekend with my aunt and had a great experience. I was checking out the jewelry in front and one of the associates was very helpful and she told us about the buy two get one half off deal. She joked with me about some of the new earrings and we had a fun conversation. I love the selection of unique jewelry (I got some moustache earrings in support of Movember) and the interesting knick knacks around the store. The cute clothes are great as well. I could probably easily spend $200 here on any given trip. I like stores where I can find interesting gifts and treasures. I will be back...

I have driven by Rudy's many a times in the past few months and finally decided to give it a try last night. We met some friends here for a going away party and everyone around the table loved the food. The line on a weekend night is long, but well worth the wait. It is very much a family style, no plates, eat with your fingers type of experience so plan accordingly.   I decided on the pulled pork sandwich and a side of potato salad. The pulled pork was delicious. Served without BBQ sauce so you can add your own. The pulled pork was moist and tender and could have definitely been eaten without BBQ sauce if that's your thing, it's definitely not mine, the more sauce the better. They have two sauce choices. Rudy's original BBQ sauce or Rudy's Sissy Sauce. I of course went for the original seeking some spice and it did not disappoint. It was delicious! The potato salad was just okay, not great, not bad. The pulled pork sandwich with loads of sauce was delicious. This girl didn't mind getting her hands dirty for some good BBQ!  Overall good experience. I will be back for more. From what I hear they have amazing BBQ breakfast tacos which sound different and delicious. I will be back to try those.

I just reviewed the Scottsdale location of Charming Charlie last week and I thought it could not get much better than that, I was wrong!  This location is set up even better! The Scottsdale Fashion Square location is bigger but this location is much more organized. The Scottsdale location is not bad as far as organization goes but the clearance section is sometimes a little crazy. This location has got it together! Everything was put in it's own place by color and size and style, someone has really got it together at this store! It is amazing to me that an accessory store could stay so organized. The customer service is always great when I come to a Charming Charlie. My cashier tonight was very friendly and just seemed happy to work there. Just good all around! Happy customer!

Senor Taco is amazing. Great food, good prices, good service. The Bean Burrito enchilada style with red sauce is so good, beats out many expensive local Mexican restaurants and it is big enough to split between two people. The crunchy shredded beef taco's are really good and taste home made and not generic reheated.   The salsa bar is really good and has great spicy and mild options. This girl loves her some hot sauce so any Mexican restaurant that has a salsa bar has special place in my heart. Senor Taco is great. Eat here. Often.

I had a good experience tonight at TQLA. I would come back for sure. The restaurant itself is really nice. I like to contemporary vibe and the relaxed feel of the candle light. Our waiter, Ryan was outstanding and from the other reviews it seems like service can be hit or miss but Ryan has really got it together. First we were served chips and two types of salsa. The chips were just okay but the salsa's were quite good. We had a green avocado and cilantro based salsa and a fire roasted tomato based salsa which is served warm which I found unique and I'm not sure if I like it or not, I haven't decided yet. Our waiter Ryan suggested a few things, the queso being one, the fajita's another. We decided we would try the queso on another visit but went for the fajita's. We got a combo of chicken and steak. They were amazing! Great flavor. If I were to get them again I would probably only get chicken only because the steak had kind of a teriyaki flavor to it which I didn't really think complemented the Mexican flair.   Our waiter also brought out a sample of the habanero salsa since we wanted to try something a little spicier. It is usually $2.50 for the side but he let us try a sample for free because we were on the fence about it. It was great and really added to the fajitas, it was a little sweet and a little spicy I would definitely recommend it if you like sweet heat! I also had a margarita flight, with a blood orange, chamboard and house margarita for $10. It was a little pricey but I like to try out the variety at a new restaurant. I would get the blood orange again but I would come back for happy hour which is 3-7pm Mon-Fri and they also serve half price apps.   Overall good experience. I would definitely come back. It seems as though the consistency can be iffy here so I will write an update on my next visit.

Great subs and a fun concept. Basically you go in and choose your meat, or veggie sub choice pick up a brown paper bag and choose your bread, cheese and toppings and whether or not you would like it toasted. It's simple, relatively fast (if it's not lunch rush) and better than going down the line at at your local sub chain yelling what you want on your sub at the unenthusiastic sandwich maker behind the counter. I have been here three times so far. The first time around 3:30 on a Thursday and the service was slow as molasses, but to cut them some slack I think they had just opened the store and the manager came over and apologized. The other two times has been during the lunch rush around 12:30 and the service has been much improved. I will be returning to Which wich to decide which wich I will be eating next!

Lets face it, waxing is not fun. So, it is extremely important to have someone knowledgeable, experienced and somewhat entertaining when you are getting hair ripped out of your body. I have found a great waxer, Katie at this location of European Wax Center. She is very experienced and is also funny which helps ease the pain (a little).   European wax center uses a strip less wax which is much better on the skin and they also have a pre treatment process which helps. They are experts at eyebrow waxing and offer many other services. I have had a great experience so far and I will continue to see Katie for my waxing needs.

This Hallmark location is set up nicely. They have a wide selection of cards for many occasions. Most recently I was here for Mother's Day cards. I was also looking for a mother to be card which I could not find. I did ask for help and the associate was happy to help me find what I was looking for. I was a little disappointed in the selection but it was a specialty card and I was there the day before Mother's Day so I can't really say anything bad. I am a huge Disney fan and I have also been able to find cute little wood decorations carved with Disney quotes which I have hanging up in various places around the house.  I also find great Christmas supplies here. I was able to get great deals the day after Christmas and as a tip, from time to time they will put out past season Christmas supplies at various times of the year to get rid of them. You can get rock bottom prices. Always good to stock up on holiday decorations.  I will definitely be back. Hallmark is one of those places that will bring up those feelings of nostalgia and I enjoy my visits to this location.

Went to experience Gordon Ramsay BurGR on Halloween and it did not disappoint.  It was very busy but our waitress was great and very attentive. She explained the drink menu and told us the special of the day. The drink menu is interactive on an Ipad which is cool. I ordered a jalapeno margarita and it was delicious - expensive as Hell at $14 but what do you expect, it's Gordon Ramsay and it's Vegas.   We started off with the roasted jalapeno poppers. They were very good. Served in six individual little shot glasses filled with bacon ranch. We all really enjoyed these. I had the damnation chicken burger which was amazing! It had carrot and celery slaw with buffalo sauce and ranch and maytag bleu cheese. The flavor was incredible. Our table also had an order of the garlic parmesan truffle fries. They were good but not my favorite. For the price I don't think I would order them again. I would try the onion rings instead.  Overall my experience here was great. Service was good, food was amazing. It is expensive but it is worth it. You are paying for both the food and the experience.

So it seems it is the time in my life that everyone around me is pregnant, it is in the water as they say. I was in the area today and I noticed that Baby Town just moved into this shopping center. My sister is expecting her first baby soon along with many other close friends who are also expecting so I figured I might as well check it out. This store is huge. Similar in size to a Bed Bath and Beyond except for baby supplies. The flow of the store was nice and easy to navigate. I browsed through many baby clothes and they have a variety of brands and prices. I found clothes ranging anywhere from $7.99-$34.99. They also have a great selection of furniture. The average price of a crib set was around $550 and most converted into toddler beds.   Pretty much anything you need for baby it is here. They also have a selection of nursing bras which I know can be hard to find. Overall very good prices and great selection. It is also great to support a local business. I would recommend this store to my pregnant pals and keep it in mind for the future.

I was in desperate need (and a little bit of denial) that I needed to get glasses. Today was the day. I had to get my prescription at a different location also located in Chandler Fashion Center but they did not take my insurance as far as frames go so I made my way to Visionworks to pick out frames. I had a good experience here.  They are in the process of renovating the store layout so things were understandably a bit messy. The frames were all in there respectable locations, women's, men's, kid's even though they seemed to be still setting up new displays. Visionworks had a great selection, bigger than other local competitors and they also have a wide range of prices which is nice. I ended up with a really beautiful pair of vintage inspired Guess frames which I am kind of in love with right now.  The insurance information was easily handled and I had given my prescription and handled all paperwork with in fifteen minutes. The associate was very nice and told me it would only be about an hour to put the prescription lenses in. I was very impressed for a Sunday afternoon, I figured I would have to come back the next day. When I came back to pick them up they were ready and I was out the door. Good service and great selection. I am impressed.

Tried Longhorn for the first time last night. Will not go back. With so many other great choices in this area of Phoenix/Chandler I'm afraid with the quality of food and service we received last night that this place won't last long.  We went to Longhorn around 9:00pm on a Sunday which understandably is a little late for a Sunday night dinner and the restaurant closed at 10 but that still does not justify poor service. We were seated right away but in the busy middle section of the restaurant. With so many open tables in other areas of the restaurant (I know they are trying to keep it to one service area) but it was very loud in the this area and felt very stuffy for a late night dining experience. It did not help that about 10 minutes after arriving one of the waitresses started a pretty loud mini vacuum that was extremely distracting to dinner conversation and many patrons seemed very displeased that she was vacuuming around our tables while we were trying to enjoy dinner. Our waitress never introduced herself once and seemed in a huge rush the entire time we were having dinner. I ordered a skinny wild berry sangria first off and it was horrible! It tasted like pure corn syrupy berry jam. I have never had a sangria made with syrup in the first place, it should be made with fresh fruit even at a chain restaurant. Horrible first impression. Our waitress did take that off of the bill but never apologized and never offered to bring me something different and never suggested a different option.  Our food was worse. I had a sirloin with portabello sauce cooked medium. The portabello sauce came just plopped on top but not melted at all, it just looked like a congealed blob of goo. Yuck. I scraped that off and cut in to the steak. It was very fatty and more like medium well. The meat itself was very bland and not well seasoned. My fiance had a stuffed filet filled with white cheddar and bacon. It was not stuffed at all. It was once again a congealed blob of goo on top of the steak. His steak had a much better flavor and probably the only reason I gave this review two stars but it was still extremely fatty for a filet. Dry baked potato, overcooked noodles in mac and cheese and out of green beans. Boo. I could just see Gordan Ramsey sitting down for a "trial" of the food at this place and saying WHAT IS THAT?!? at the weird blob of fatty goo they called sauce.   Do not eat here. You have many other great options in the area. Outback has much better quality of meat at a lower price, Z'Tejas is an amazing Southwest option right next door and around the same price and Roy's is pretty expensive but well worth it and also right next door.

I was here a few days ago and I had a good experience. I was able to find really cute baby clothes for my niece at a great price. They also had some great deals on sun dresses and on this particular day it was take an additional 40% off everything in the store.  The men's section had a great selection of graphic tees and jeans. I was also asked if I was finding everything alright and the associates seemed like they were happy to help. At the register I was assisted right away and the cashier was very nice. Customer service was top notch. The only downfall was that the tables were a little bit messy from being over shopped but I know that it can be difficult to keep up on recovery at times so I will give them a break on that.  I will be back.

I recently stopped  by the newest location of It's Sugar in the brand new Phoenix Premium Outlets in Chandler and I had a good experience.  I had never been in an It's Sugar store before but I must say the large and very brightly colored Nerds window display caught my attention. I was having a little bit of a down day and I must say walking into this store made me happy. Brightly colored, loud but good music, nicely organized and best of all full of candy. Candy as far as the eye can see. It brought me back to the good ol' days of going to the mall with my friends and picking out our favorite bulk candy and sneaking it into the movies. Many great bulk candy options that are organized by hard candy, gummy candy, sour gummy candy and finally a chocolate lovers paradise. They also have international chocolate bars, standard chocolate bars and other prepackeged goodies.  In the back of the store they have a novelties section which is stocked with some funny little knick knacks. I found a Doctor OCD hand sanitizer with double the amount in every squeeze. This gave me quite a laugh. There are many other funny items such as, bacon flavored mints for a hint of bacon in every kiss, a banana wine stopper and a variety of novelites for any personality.  I enjoyed my visit to this store. I was there in the middle of the week on a Thursday and my experience could have been much different with 20 kids running around in each direction but I was the only one in the store and I had a great time. If you are craving candy and maybe a few laughs, stop by It's Sugar...

I was searching for a nice place to get a reasonbly priced lunch at Scottsdale Quarter a few days ago and I came across C3 Kitchen. I was impressed by the cute open air set up of the outside of the restaurant. It was the day after Christmas and they were very busy but the line moved pretty quickly. I decided on the hot roast beef with green chile and pepper jack sandwich. I also got a ginger root beer hand crafted soda out of the fridge case. They gave me a number and I decided to sit outside.  The sandwich was piping hot when they brought it out to me. It was so delicious. I am pretty particular when it comes to roast beef and I tend to steer away from it most times but this roast beef was great quality and it tasted great with the spicy green chile. The sandwich itself was kind of panini style with very crunchy and delicious bread.  C3 also has an amazing breakfast menu and a full service coffee bar. I would be back to try both. The quality of the food is great and I would love to try more items.

Grand Central Clothing is a cute little boutique in the Casa Paloma shopping center in Chandler. I love it! Cute maxi dresses, adorable blouses and summer tops, shorts, jeans, skirts, everything! The prices are great as well. Most items are around $50 or less. I recently found an adorable dress that you can wear multi ways that will be great for a beach trip to Cali. Colors change with the seasons which is also awesome because I love seeing the new color displays in the windows. Customer service has been good every time I have stopped in. The girls are really good at giving suggestions and one on one service. I will be back!

My fiancé took me on a surprise trip to Butterfly Wonderland today and it was quite a wonderful experience. I had no idea about this new hidden gem in Scottsdale and I will definitely be returning. You start off by going into the butterfly incubation room where you can see butterfly cocoons and butterflies emerging. There was a liaison in the room describing the metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly and the different incubation times for different species. It is very interesting to see different types of exotic butterfly cocoons. If you get lucky you can sometimes see one emerging from the cocoon.  We then made our way into the butterfly rainforest area. This room is air sealed so you may have to wait a few moments so that they ensure that no butterflies escape in the transition of the doors opening. This room is very muggy and warm so be prepared for that. It is probably around 90 degrees at least and they keep it that way for the butterflies. At certain times a mist is released and it cools it down substantially but you will get hot in this area. If you are like me the hot, muggy environment will not distract you from the peaceful tranquility of the butterflies and plants. This was such a relaxing experience for me. I spent about an hour in this room and could have stayed even longer. You can refer to your visitor's guide and try to spot different species of butterflies. There are many flying around and so many great photo opportunities. Definitely bring a camera. There is a big water fountain in the middle of the room and it is a little cooler in this area. The butterflies also love this area and it is a very peaceful place to sit and relax. I did not find it to be crowded at all and this was a holiday weekend.  The second area that you are able to view after the butterfly rainforest is an exhibit on ants and bees. It is also quite interesting and it is cool to watch the ants burrow and see how they communicate. The bee hive that they have set up is connected to the desert outside and the bees bring back the honey to a see through bee hive. They have facts posted about how the bees collect honey and how they are good for our environment. The last exhibit is a small fresh water aquarium. It is listed in the brochure as an amazon adventure. This is the area of the attraction that is going through growing pains. I think it will be a really cool exhibit once it has been open for a little longer. I did see a couple of dead fish in the tanks but I know that is common when an aquarium is first opening because the tanks have to balance out. They did not have enough information posted about the fish and we were wondering about the species and the area they were indigenous to. They also have a small sting ray pool with very small sting rays. The liaisons were very good about asking if we wanted to touch the sting rays and while we chose not to, many of the little kids were so happy to be able to have that experience.   Overall I had a wonderful time and will definitely be back. This would be a great place to bring kids of any age as well as a great outing for adults. It is very educational and also a peaceful and tranquil environment.

I have visited this location a couple of times now because I am sometimes in this area for business reasons. This Green Leaf's location is located in the food court of the newly opened Phoenix Premium Outlets and let me tell you the food court has very limited options. Unfortunately none of them are very good. Green Leaf's is especially bad.   I came here for the first time a couple of days after the restaurant first opened. I ordered one of the hot chipotle turkey Panini's off of the sandwiches menu. There were maybe 3 or 4 people in line ahead of me and I could tell that the new employees were quite flustered and hadn't quite gotten the hang of things yet which is fine because they are still learning. It took about ten minutes for me to place my order and because of the way the line is set up, you give your order first and then pay but people were getting confused and cutting in front of each other and it took another five minutes to pay for what I had ordered. That is when the real waiting game began. A woman in front of me had also ordered a Panini but a different one than I had. We both waited over to the side for about fifteen minutes. After waiting twenty minutes for our food we both went up and asked why it was taking so long. One of the employees came over and said oh both of your sandwiches are coming out right now. He brought both sandwiches over wrapped up and handed them over the counter. We asked which was which. He had forgotten. He said to give them back over and he would cut into them and see which one was the correct one. He proceeded to hand both sandwiches to the other woman who had ordered the Panini before me. I said wait a minute, that is my sandwich. He quickly yanked it away from her and said very aggressively I KNOW WHICH ONE IS YOURS! I said politely well thank you for being so aware of the situation that you just yanked that out of your customers hands and for the fact that we have been waiting for over twenty minutes for our sandwiches. I understand that the restaurant just opened but he crossed the line when he got an attitude. I don't know his name but he has a beard and my second (and last visit) to this restaurant found out the he is a manager which is horrible in my opinion. I hope the owners become aware of the way he is talking to customers. That was strike one and two for me. The sandwich was actually very good on this first visit which was the only redeeming factor.  On the second visit it was a slow Tuesday afternoon. I was the only one in line and ordered the same thing, a hot turkey chipolte panini. The same unpleasant bearded gentleman took my order. He was nicer this time around. He did seem to joking around in the back with his employees before coming out to take my order. The reason I know that he is a manager is because I observed one of the other employees asking him to approve a discount. He proceeded to make my sandwich which still took about fifteen minutes despite there being no one else in line. I was in a little bit of hurry that day because I needed to get to a meeting. I got my sandwich and started to eat it on the patio outside. It was all wrong. It had chicken breast instead of turkey with avacado and then a pesto sauce, definitely NOT turkey chipolte. He had probably given someone else's sandwich just like the last time it had almost happened. It did not taste very good at all and the combonation of flavors was horrible. I got extremely sick the night after eating this and with the attention that is being paid by management it is pretty clear to me why. It is shame that such a new restaurant that is one of the only healthy options around is so poorly run. Also very expensive ($7-$12) for a salad or sandwich combo and it does not live up to this quality.  If you are in the Phoenix Premium Outlets area I do not recommend eating here. I have also had coworkers get extremely ill after consuming smoothies from the Banana's smoothie side of this restaurant. Bad, bad, bad!

I have been very impressed with Nails Studio 54 every time I have come in. Most recently a friend and I came in to get pedicures and our experience was fantastic. The pedicure chairs were very clean and comfortable. The ladies doing our nails were very polite and gentle which is important to me. I wanted a pretty intricate design and my nail tech was able to accommodate my blue ombre request. Overall a good experience. I will be back.

Tom's BBQ is good. I am a fan of the pulled pork sandwich. Not a big fan of the Chicago style hot dog. I am a true midwest girl and I like a nice snap to my hot dog. I did not get that at Tom's. I did however get a nice sweet but smoky sauce with a very tender pulled pork on a soft bun. The mac and cheese was just okay. Cole slaw is good.  I would like to try in the future the pulled pork nachos as well as the Italian beef sandwich with hot peppers. Service was wonderful. The nice lady at the counter gave us suggestions on what to order on our first visit and was very welcoming. Overall I had a good first impression of Tom's. I will be back.

This location of FastMed Urgent Care is brand new and one of the best urgent care experiences I have ever had. I had to go in this past Sunday for a recent injury and I had a very good experience from start to finish. I went in around 10:30 am Sunday morning. There was no one in the waiting room which was nice because I was hoping I would quickly be seen. I filled out the general paper work and that all went very quickly.  I was called back within ten minutes of filling out the paperwork. I was taken into a room and gave a brief description of my injury to the nurse. The doctor, Kelly Connor was wonderful. She had great bedside manner and she was very funny and delightful. I wish I could have her as my primary care doctor. They have a real gem of doc with her which I feel is hard to find these days. I was in and out within maybe 40 minutes which I feel is really good for a urgent care.   If this location becomes busier which I am sure that it will, I can't say how long the wait might be but for me this was a great experience. I would return here for sure if I have any future urgent care needs as well as recommending my friends here.

A week after my visit, a nurse from FastMed called me just to check to see how I was doing! If that is not great customer service I don't know what is! Wow I am impressed! Many other doctor's office's, urgent care's, dentist's and any other service industry should take note. This is what you should be doing!  If you are in need of an urgent care and live in the Chandler or Gilbert area this location is worth the drive. Great customer service. Bravo FastMed!

This was my first experience at a Smashburger and I was impressed! We were greeted upon entering around 2pm this afternoon. Looked over the menu and noticed you have the option of either beef or chicken for any of the burgers. I decided on the Arizona burger which was a delicious combo of habanero cheese, guacamole, jalapenos and burger on a chipolte bun, YUM. They also have sweet potato fries which is a plus in my book. My sister is on low carb plan right now and Smashburger was happy to accommodate her requests as well. She got a grilled chicken burger made protein style with a side of fried green beans and carrots, she loved both.  The service was friendly and the food was great. I enjoyed the taste of my burger here much more than Five Guys which is what I would say is the most comparable to Smashburger. Overall good experience. I would definitely come back.

Went to Charm last night based on a recommendation from a friend and we had a great time. It is in downtown Chandler and the restaurant is quite small in the inside but it wasn't too busy on a quiet rainy night. It was the perfect atmosphere.  Our waiter was very nice and gave our group of three girls plenty of time to catch up and talk and laugh and look over the menu. We decided to start with the calamari and coconut shrimp which were both delicious. I am not usually a coconut shrimp fan because I usually find it to be too sweet, but this was perfect. Just the right amount of sweet and savory. The calamari was battered just right and the perfect consistency, I also enjoyed the sriacha cream sauce it was served with.  For dinner I decided on the ribeye thai basil, cooked medium rare. It was delicious! I had it prepared with hot seasoning which definitely crept on me over time but it was not overpowering or too spicy. I would recommend going with medium heat if you are not as big of fan of spicy. The white rice that it was served with was great and soaked up all of the spices. My friends had the crab fried rice and the seafood pad thai. The crab fried rice was out of this world! It was probably the best fried rice I have ever had (aside from the fried rice that my Cambodian friend makes but that's another story). It was tender and served with jumbo lump crab meat on the top, it tasted buttery and melted in your mouth. Yum!! The seafood pad thai was not really something I would order but it was still very good. My friend loved it. It was very unique because not very many restaurants put a variety of seafood in pad thai. It included clams, scallops, tilapia and a few other seafood items.   At the end of the night my friends and I asked for a picture and our waiter was really nice and took a couple of great pictures of us lively ladies lol. He was a good sport.  Overall it was a great night. I would highly recommend Charm Thai for a unique and delicious Thai experience in Chandler.

This is a new Philly cheesesteak restaurant in Arizona Mills Mall. It looks like it replaced Great Steak and Potato which used to be one of my favorite quick service restaurants in AZ Mills. Arizona Mills is doing a big food court overhaul and this seemed to be one of many new restaurants.  I was not impressed. I got the buffalo chicken philly, which is what I always used to get at Great Steak. It was extremely salty and the chicken was like deli slices instead of an actual chopped up chicken breast. It was drowning in sauce and so salty I downed two waters afterwards. I realize that I should not expect a ton from a quick service restaurant in the mall but Great Steak used to make this sandwich so well and this was no where near the same quality. It took about ten minutes to get one sandwich which wasn't too bad. Overall, bad food. I will not be back.

Nektar just opened very close to my work and we were all very excited. They have fresh pressed juices, blended smoothies and acai bowls. They are also going to be getting in a line of detoxifying cleanses in a couple of weeks. So far I have tried the buzz which is a mix of carrot, orange, lemon and ginger and it is delicious. It is around $7 for a 24oz juice or smoothie so, they are definitely not cheap but very healthy. The acai bowls are also delicious. They are pretty much a blended type of sorbet made of acai berries and cashew milk, topped with fresh fruit and granola, they have 4 flavors of these.  Overall my experience here has been great so far. I have met the owner/manager and he is very nice. The service has been great so far. It does take about 10 minutes to make a fresh juice so just be prepared for that time. I will be back!

Came back to Cheddar's a couple of nights ago because I was still craving those ribs that I didn't get to try on the first visit. We arrived at the restaurant at 6:45pm. I had called ahead and asked about the wait time for 2 and I was informed that the wait was about 35 minutes. We were okay with that. When we got to the restaurant the wait had increased to 45 minutes which was whatever, I understand that they are busy and they are the new kid on the block. Right away we after sitting in the waiting area we witnessed a rather unpleasant scene unfold. A very unhappy gentleman was at the hostess stand yelling that he had been waiting for 2 hours. Now this is rather ridiculous and if he and his party had been waiting that long, they should have approached the stand earlier or just left, there is no need to wait that long to be seated in a restaurant, I guarantee the food here is not worth a 2 hour wait. They GM came over to the stand and told the man that they would get him seated immediately. He did follow the GM to the table but he was clearly very angry. After that, we witnessed about 3 other guests come up to the stand and say they had been waiting well over 45 minutes. They were all seated right away. The manager came back to the hostess stand and yelled at all of the girls (3 of them) working on the seating chart. It was very unprofessional and he should have done this at a different time in a different setting. Clearly, all they needed at that point was help. Poor management. This whole seating debacle seemed to set everything back and we didn't end up being seated until 7:45pm.   Once seated we were greeted quickly by our waitress. She was nice and got us water right away. Unfortunately after she got us water, we only saw her about once every 15-20 minutes. First my fiance ordered a starter salad. We received this about 20 minutes after being seated. We usually share the salad so we asked for an additional plate, never got it. It had hardly any ranch on it so we asked for an extra side of ranch, we never got it. We ordered our entrees when our salad came out, I ordered the ribs with mac and cheese and cole slaw, my fiance ordered the chicken fingers 50/50 with half buffalo and half original and fries. It took another 30 minutes for the food to arrive. We saw many other tables around us, who had been seated after us receive their food before we did. I do have to say that the ribs were good, not the best I have ever had but they were tasty. The mac and cheese was really good. The problem was with my fiance's meal. First of all, the half buffalo, half original was a joke. I thought based on pictures that had been posted that the buffalo strips came out similar to a buffalo wing. Wrong. Instead they just shook some buffalo sauce over the top of the strips which coated parts of all of the chicken strips making them all buffalo, not 50/50. It also made them extremely soggy and the breading just fell apart, not very appetizing. When the chicken strips came out he had asked for barbecue sauce right away. We waited and waited and never saw our waitress. No barbecue sauce to be found. Sometimes you really need a sauce to be able to eat a meal, this was one of those cases. My fiance never received his sauce and was very unhappy about the entire meal. Service was horrible. It was non existent really. I can only imagine that based on the way that the GM was talking to the hostess staff that it also carried over to the wait staff which in turn, I'm sure makes for a very stressful environment especially for new staff. It was 9:15pm when we left the restaurant.  Overall my assessment is that Cheddar's has a long way to go to become a smooth running restaurant. They need to work out some kinks in both customer service and the kitchen in order to improve the experience for their guests. They just simply don't know how to handle how busy the restaurant currently is and this is not making a good impression for a new restaurant. It will be a long time before I visit Cheddar's again. The food is pretty good but not worth an hour wait and poor customer service.

The Fractured Prune is a fun and different doughnut concept and I am a big fan! I love being able to customize flavors and mix and match so this is really the type of place for me. The doughnuts are more of a cake style with different glazes and powder/sprinkle toppings. They have multiple pre-fix options, as well as an option to create your own flavor combinations on the order sheet.  Some of the favorites from our group meeting were, chocolate covered cherry, morning buzz (mocha flavored with chocolate topping) and french toast. The customer service was also great and the gentleman on the phone helped me place a phone order after looking over the menu online. I liked the experience so much I went back for another dozen for my fiance's work meeting that same day. They also have a frequent buyer program, when you buy (I think 8 dozen) you get a dozen for free.  Overall great experience. I would highly reccommend trying it out if you have a sweet craving anytime soon!

Finding a good doctor is hard these days but I have found a good one at Banner Health Center. Dr. Shalini is wonderful. She takes the time to really listen to what I have to say and we make the decision together of what will be the best plan for my health. I actually get to see her and not a PA which was a constant problem at my previous PCP office. Sometimes there is a little bit of a wait at the front desk but the  front desk associates have always been very helpful.  I would highly recommend Dr. Shalini as a great female PCP in the Chandler/Gilbert area.

Very mediocre is how I would describe my experience at Hurricane Grill. After looking over the menu, I was really craving the jerk chicken wings but come to find out they were out of jerk sauce. Disappointing. After that I decided I would try something really spicy so I went for the spiciest wings on the menu, the garlic inferno wings. They were spicy not crazy burn your lips off spicy but they definitely snuck up on me. They also had a sweet teriakyi vibe to them. The bone in chicken wings them self were just okay, very small and kind of dry. My fiance had the original hot buffalo sauce which was also just okay.  We also had an order of the bacon cheese fries which were good. We finished with a slice of chocolate cheesecake which was very disappointing. It literally tasted like the Hershey's chocolate pie that you can get at Burger King.  Service was okay. Drinks were not refilled which is very important when eating spicy food. Overall I just felt like everything tasted frozen and or pre-packaged. Just meh. I really didn't care for it. I don't think I would come back.

Beyond happy that Espo's is back in business! Everyday driving by on the way home was so sad knowing that Espo's was gone. All I could think was how much business would have been brought in by the new hotel across the street. Well now it will!  Same menu as before but laid out very nicely in the front of the restaurant. Same type of ordering process, order at the front, they call your number when your order is ready. It looks like they no longer have a liquor license which is no big deal to me and I don't think it will be detrimental to the business, the food speaks for itself.  I had two machaca beef tacos which were delicious. Espo's does machaca beef so well. The green chile beef is a staple here and great in both burrito form as well as chimichanga if you are being adventurous. Service was great.  I'm so glad Espo's is back. Reasonably priced Mexican food that is done so well. You can't beat it!

I've been going to this Harkins for years now and I have always had good experiences here. It is an overall very clean theater. The staff does a good job keeping up on housekeeping despite it being very busy on the weekends.  Even when busy the ticket lines don't seem to get too long and the cashiers have always been friendly. I have noticed the new release screens are bigger than some of the longer running movies left behind but if you wait a week or so to see a movie you can always get good seats. Concession prices are outrageous but that is the case at any movie theater these days and the $1 refill cup is so worth it.   Overall nice theater. Parking is horrible so get there early for a show. I will be back.
