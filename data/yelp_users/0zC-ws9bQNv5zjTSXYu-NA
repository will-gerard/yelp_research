Having lived in the neighborhood for eight years, I can't say much other than: variety, reliable, authentic. But what I'm really compelled to tell you all about is...  They now serve Thai! In addition to their already huge menu!   The Chicken Pad Thai is arguably the best I've ever had (I've had it in New York and San Francisco). Its crazy how good it is... I had to have it two days in a row to confirm. I've had the green curry and that was yummy - fresh veggies in everything, crispy and plentiful.  IMHO, their decor rocks! I love the cheesy waterfall in the front, the chairs with coffee cup designs and giant turntable-centered family-sized tables. The green walls are an upgrade from the pink and blue that was there before. Go to Fate if you want to sit in faux-modern Ikea surroundings.  This place is classic Mc Do Well

Adam M. was absolutely right: The Chinese Broccoli in Garlic Sauce and the Mixed Seafood Hot Pot (Casserole) are really, really amazing! I've also become a big fan of the Tomato Sauce Shrimp - tastes nothing like what you're thinking.   Eat these items we recommend or be seriously disappointed trying the chinese staples you've become brainwashed into enjoying elsewhere.

Walking into Red is a serious problem for most: you're confronted with what is easily the most beautiful selection of vintage furniture in Phoenix... and the prices are astronomical. I used to complain about this until I became aware of what the going prices are for the same exact items in coastal cities. Phoenix: we got it good; stop complaining.  We recently showed our home for the first time on a historic home tour. A Tudor Revival built in 1931, we've always struggled to find the right furniture, accents and fixtures to fit the antique style with our modern tastes. We went to Red hoping just to find some inspiration, but after explaining to the owner what we were doing, he offered to send someone to review our space.  We ended up with a suede 60's era danish couch and two leather chairs that made the rest of our interior look downright stupid. We ended up redecorating, paint and all, to better suit the new furniture. It was a lot of work but well worth it.  We now are on the verge of a full-blown vintage furniture addiction that is only being held back by our income. I've actually considered putting off plans to travel the world and raise a family in order to get the perfect coffee table.

I don't know why others had such a problem with the owner Petey: I went in for the first time last weekend and he was just fine. Perhaps its because I've learned over the years how to communicate to boutique shop owners that I'm not "just looking" but I'm on a hunt for the perfect fucking end tables and I hate chrome.  You would be surprised how far that approach goes at any place: tell the owner what you like and don't like right away. Letting them know you have an opinion allows them to engage with you as someone who appreciates design; not just another customer.  Now with that rant out of the way, I'd like to let you know that you'll find some cool shit here. Its a serious challenge to see everything there is in such a cramped place, so plan ahead to spend some time there. And for the love of God, don't bring your kid. In fact, go alone so you can make it around easier.  You wont find everything in perfect condition, but the prices are very reasonable. I felt like I was getting away with murder when I picked up a lamp last time. Go support Petey and his dog, they're good at what they do.

If the stale retirement home setting and stuck-in-the-80's styled menu don't encourage you to leave before ordering, waiting for the amateur service will.  Oh, you're still here? Ok, go ahead and order any of their so-called omelettes. Be sure to also ask for lots of napkins because you'll be crying when you finally see the nonsense that comes out of the kitchen.  The way I see it, cooking omlettes is very simple: you take good ingredients, mix them together, cook it all without burning. Somehow they manage to ignore all of these suggestions. Yes, even the "mixing" part. They apparently manufacture a plain omelette on one side of the kitchen, and then lightly sprinkle on whatever ingredients right before serving it.  When paying my bill at the front I was asked, "How was everything?". I replied in a polite tone, "O.K." Cashier boy responds in bewilderment, "Just 'O.K.'?!?" I finally leave him with, "I'm being nice when I say 'O.K.'"  I'm sticking to Taylor's, Matt's and 5th Avenue Cafe for my weekend breakfast.

Shame! This is Arizona, you can't get by with half-assed Mexican food. Lunch service was slow as hell and they got three orders wrong, no refills, food itself was lackluster. The only reason I gave them two stars is the price was reasonable.

After two years now, they've really done a great job at keeping the more annoying music off the playlist... or maybe some jaded hipster finally quit. Either way, I like hanging out there now instead of just getting stuff to go.

Overpriced and out-dated. Simple things like the pico were obviously old (mushy tomatoes, soggy onions), the camaron crepe appetizer was tiny and they used iceberg lettuce as its garnish. Ordered a $26 filet minion medium rare and it came out medium well. All other dishes were just barely warm, not hot and definitely not fresh.   The main dining room smells like rat turds: literally. Years ago I helped a friend remodel a house that had a severe roof rat problem: it's one of those smells you wish you could forget. This place sucks. Go to Barrio Cafe if you want quality upscale Mexican cuisine.

This is a really nice, classy joint. Don't bring your punk friends here or try to act cute, got it? Good.  Now for those who enjoy a good lunch: the portions are generous, the daily specials always are and they put ice in the mens room. This place also happens to be hidden in the coolest strip mall in all of Arizona. If you can't find it, you don't belong there.

Oh Sabuddy, how I love your delicious, authentic food and friendly staff.  The mint tea is perfect without any sweetening. Hummus is good and always has a lot of tahini and olive oil in the center. The lentil soup is why this place is legend now in Tempe.  The schnitzel is my favorite dish. A sesame and paprika covered chicken breast pounded thin and fried with love, served on top of marinated vegetables, rice, salad and hummus. My last visit was with some co-workers and all four of us ordered the same thing, and I got one to go.

Three friends and I went for lunch today. I don't think we'll go back unless we hear about improvements.  I had the "General Chicken" lunch combo for $7.50. The hot and sour soup was so-so, but I had to add their "sweet sauce" to make it interesting. Although the obligatory chili icon indicate this was a spicy dish, the General Tso's chicken had zero heat and very little flavor. If I had to guess, I'd say it was just colored corn syrup for sauce. The crab puffs we're big and packed... with dried, crumbled blah inside. I didn't bother eating the second one.   My friend who ordered the same dish agreed that everything was "eh". The other two weren't impressed with their chow-mein or the Shanghai Club special.  The decor is nice: dark, comfortable atmosphere with tasteful water fountains and traditional Chinese instruments on display. The staff was great, too bad the food is weak.

I've been to CityScape three times in the past month and have yet to experience anything remotely worth praising.  The first time I went was with my girlfriend to check out the Lucky Strike bowling alley for the monthly mixer Radiate PHX. I had already heard about the alley's dress code, but I don't wear baggy clothes, sweat pants or sports logos so that wasn't a big deal. The problem we had was finding the entrance!  After parking in the underground garage we took the closest set of stairs up to the plaza/mall/courtyard. We ended up on the North side facing Washington, just next to the new art/bent-paper-clip sculpture. Knowing in advanced that Lucky Strike was on the Southwest corner, we walked down 1st Ave to where the CVS drug store is located. We could clearly see the Lucky Strike signage, but not the entrance.  In what was hilariously reminiscent of a scene from 'This Is Spinal Tap', we spent the next 5 minutes trying every door, hallway, elevator and stairwell trying to figure out how to get into the place. Turns out there is no way to enter the 2nd floor from Jefferson! Whisky Tango Foxtrot?  I'm a big fan of architecture (no, seriously: Last year I went to New York just to go on a walking tour with Taliesin students, I have dreams about Calatrava's work, I consider Will Bruder, Frank Henry & Michael P. Johnson my hometown heroes) so of course I started to really analyze CityScape. After a few minutes I could see that place has no distinction and was not built to human scale: its actually got less soul than Tempe Marketplace, Desert Ridge and West Gate! This place is not designed to serve those who call downtown Phoenix home: its obviously designed to appeal to all of the suburbanites who think fauxdobes and tuscan mcmansions are awesome.  So many people assume that if you criticize CityScape, you are somehow in favor of what was there before. Bullshit. Most sane people agree that Patriot's Square Park (1990-2006) was a flop and eyesore. The most often complaint is that is was a haven for the homeless. So did CityScape somehow make all these homeless people have homes, or better yet, just disappear? No. They simply displaced them into another area of town, just like all gentrification does. So don't give them credit for making the place "better", especially when we lost a public park in the process.  Back to the bowling alley: we eventually made it up the escalator and entered Lucky Strike. We entered what was mostly a Hard Rock Hotel Las Vegas atmosphere that was filled with conventioneers (Six Sigma trainees specifically). The irony of original Sheperd Fairey prints hanging in a place that enforces a dress code did not escape us.  We met up with the rest of the Radiate PHX crowd in a private, sectioned off area. We were offered various appetizers to sample. The chips and salsa were completely of the store bought variety: this is Arizona, don't do that shit. The other appetizers were a joke: typical Sysco or Shamrock foods frozen crap. The beers on tap at our bar? Bud, Bud Light and Stella. Have they never heard of The Roosevelt?  I just now realized how much I typed about my first visit, which was actually the best time I had. I'll spare you the other stories for another day.

As a native Phoenician, I'm very happy JoBot exists and somewhat fanatical about it. I'll break down what I've learned from going there almost daily since it has opened.  The coffee is awesome: all of their beans are roasted locally by Cartel. They won't make fancy designs in your foam or create any blended nonsense: they make good, traditional coffee drinks. They're by no means snobs about proper coffee etiquette and preparation like some other places, but at the same time they're not going to make you a whipped caramel frappumacchiatotini™  The iced chai: they don't serve pre-made chai here, they make it from scratch for each order. Brewed black tea is poured into a glass of honey and chai spice, then your dairy or soy choice is stirred in.  The Iced Toddy: their cold-brewed coffee is really the best I've ever had. You must try it even if you don't like cold coffee or normally order iced americanos. My only complaint is a bit trivial: they no longer used crushed ice since they picked up a new ice maker.  The scones: Chef Dom bakes scones from scratch everyday with different flavors that he won't repeat for a week or two. Last few I tried were strawberry and rose, blueberry and lemonade... both we're awesome.  The crepes: it seems like everyone always orders a sweet crepe for their first time here. The sweet ones are good, but don't make up your mind about their menu until you try a savory crepe. There's a chorizo one, roasted turkey & pesto, two pulled porks (machaca or root beer), and many, many more. If you're vegetarian they'll easily customize one for you. There are no vegan crepe options, but there's two vegan-friendly restaurants on the same block: Conspire and Of The Earth.  The service: this isn't a Starbucks! Nobody that works here is going to pretend to be gushing with fake happiness like the so-called baristas at the chains. If you want something, go up to the counter, make eye contact, and order it. Do not wait for someone to ask you want you want, especially if they're doing something important like talking to another customer, checking Facebook or picking some music to play.  The ambiance and decor: shabby chic meets practical. There's nice little details that take time to notice and the art changes every month.   I highly recommend trying this place several times on different days of the week and at different times of the day to get an idea of what it's all about. The Sunday brunch has been put on hold because it was "too successful" - something about them not having the kitchen or staff to support that kind of traffic.  One more thing: they are now open 24 hours every Friday and Saturday.

I've eaten at JoBot over 200 times since they've opened. I've never been sick once from eating or drinking there. Anyone who thinks the place is "dirty" doesn't understand that it's clean where it matters: in the kitchen. Check their health inspection history for yourself . Still bothered by the practical use of reclaimed materials, unfinished construction and make-shift furniture? Please take your pampered ass back to the suburbs and drown yourself in a bath in Purell, the regulars love this place.

Sam and Randy know their coffee, roast it themselves and then proceed to prepare it in a variety of ways that ensure you are getting the best product. Their espresso shots and drip (prepared per cup when ordered) don't require any sweetening, if you normally do that sorta thing.  The location is the closest coffee shop to me so that's a big advantage, but I'm thankful it's also a quality product. I still prefer JoBot's toddy (cold brewed ice coffee), but Mud Dauber is a very close second. The crushed ice they use is perfect for it.  Although the staff is very knowledgable of the coffee world, they won't be snobish if you're new to it. I've observed a number of times when the uninitiated come in and are treated with the same amount of respect that coffee nerds get. Something I can't say for places like Lux and Giant that make people feel stupid for ordering the "wrong" way.  Perfect minimal coffee shop located in a very cool space: so grateful my hometown is getting funkier and more original every day.

Solid selection of craft beers updated daily (use TapHunter to be informed of the list) and simple but amazing comfort food. The burgers live up to the hype, the Attic wings (grilled) become a craving after having once, service is on point and overall the staff is great considering how busy they are on some days.  If you had a bad experience here, it's likely that you are a bad person.

I've always thought an Ice Cream shop down on Roosevelt Row and/or 5th Street would be a great idea. I'm happy to see that not only did it finally happen, but the people behind it did a great job!  All the Ice Cream, Sorbets and Yogurts are local and the flavors are unique and varied. The presentation is original: Chinese take-out box with a fortune cookie. Great for those of us that skip on the waffle cone usually but still enjoy a little bit of waffle cone-like goodness at the end.  Other offerings are shakes, smoothies and ice cream flautas: chocolate cream filled canolli's with three mini-scoops on top.  The decor is shabby chic and practical, outdoor patio seating is perfect for the neighborhood. Love this place!

Friendly staff, great location, reasonable prices, always doing specials (eg, half-off all tubes for a week, half-off full service tune-ups for their grand opening).  There are a lot of bike shops in Tempe, but Pedal manages to stand out on friendliness alone.

Important stuff first: the coffee beans are roasted locally by Cartel and Xanadu, the toddy (cold brewed coffee) is perfect, the pour overs and the espresso pulls are done correctly and with care. The coffee game is strong here. In addition to standard cafe offerings, they also do Thai iced tea and Vietnamese-style sweet coffee. They will also make you an exclusive "Toddsmore" if you catch them at the right time. Worth noting is that the baristas are down-to-earth folks that won't ridicule newcomers if they order something only found at chains. Something I've seen happen all to often at other spots.  Now for the fun stuff: Located in a multi-use artist space The Hive, Demi is right in the front. The place is tiny, but there's enough room for a few people to hang out or work on their laptops. The decor features local art and a small TV showing random VHS finds that the owners pick-up from thrift stores. Thankfully, the audio to the movies is off and instead music is played over the speakers.  After coming here a few times a week for over a two month period, I'm happy to recommend them to anyone looking for a unique offering in the ever growing coffee options of downtown Phoenix.

After five visits, I'm happy to say I love everything I've ever ordered from Yard Bird + Larder. Even the most simple sides are bursting with flavor. This is the shining star of DeSoto and now the main reason I go there.

This is a great lunch spot since they are quick, have lunch specials and are consistently delicious.  In addition to a large Japanese menu, they have several Chinese dishes. The sushi is made to order and its preparation can be viewed via a large window up front. The lunch sushi specials are more than enough food for one person: Miso soup, large salad, two kinds of rolls.  The decor is pretty and tasteful without being too cliche. There are three dining areas: elevated with bench seating, front room with high tables and an outdoor Arizona room.  The pricing can be a little high ($7 lunch specials), but is reasonable considering the quality and consistency.
