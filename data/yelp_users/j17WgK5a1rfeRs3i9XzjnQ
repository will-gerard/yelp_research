This is part US Airways and part United but I booked through US Airways so I feel the fault lies with them.  I don't even know where to begin. I booked my flight July 16th from AZ to MI for Christmas. I got a couple emails with minor changes in arrival/departure time, no big deal.. Then the day comes for me to fly out, the red eye from Phoenix and I'm only able to check in to the first half of my trip... They don't have enough room for everyone's carry on and want to check my baggage but since I don't have my complete itinerary they can't and I have to stand and wait while everyone else boards while they try to locate me in the system unsuccessfully. I'm eventually allowed on the plane where there is plenty of room for luggage in first class.  I suppose PHX to ORD on US Airways went fairly smooth.. Then I arrived in Chicago at 5am after no sleep for my connecting flight to Grand Rapids. I am supposed to now fly United, so I book it to their terminal about a 20 minute walk, go to their customer service desk for boarding pass since it wouldn't let me check in online and they can't find my reservation so after a couple of calls I finally got the pass printed and I make it to Michigan.   The way home is when the real fun begins. I try to check in again online and I am unable to. I have my itinerary that states the first part of my trip is with "other airline". Well that narrows it down. I first try United since that is who I took the connection through on the way here and they say it looks as though my reservation had been wiped from the system. I got there at 4:30p since I didn't know what airline it was and was finally dealt with by 5:15. I am told the flight is overbooked and they are going to need volunteers or I won't get a seat.. The seat I booked and paid for over 5 months prior. I'm offered $200 and money for dinner to volunteer my seat but I have a connection to make and a cat at my apartment that is going to run out of food! I am told to sit and wait at the gate and talk to the agent there. Flight is supposed to leave at 630 and someone finally announces they need volunteers around 6. I see a couple people go up so I sit and wait thinking things are good.. Then they start to call zones for boarding! I go up to agent and tell him I don't have a seat and he sees that I am not on the standby list. He is scrambling and calls someone with a late connection and asks her to volunteer which she reluctantly does. He asks for her seat and come to find out she is on standby as well! They board the plane and she and I stand and watch the plane take off. (She ended up taking the later flight to Chicago which was then delayed and she missed her flight). I am told they will figure something out for me. I sit for about 45 minutes while they make some calls.. I will take the 8:20 flight to Chicago, missing my connecting flight to Phoenix. At this point I have been at the airport for 3 hours already and agree wanting to get home. I was offered a hotel and a 7am flight to Phoenix. This staff did work diligently to solve the issue and I was given $400 flight voucher but it's unacceptable. The 8:20 flight through American Airlines is delayed until 9, all food places are closed at this point and I've been at airport for almost 5 hours by the time I finally leave Grand Rapids. I was told I had to find United agent for hotel which was another 20-30 minute walk and then another 20 minute walk to shuttle and 20 minute wait for shuttle. I finally get to hotel around 10:30 Chicago time. I try again to check in online for my morning flight and cannot. I call US Airways since that's who I am flying out through and they tell me United has to release ticket since they did the booking. It's about 1am when I finally get off phone with United who tells me I can only checkin at airport through US Airways. I get 3 hours of sleep and off to the airport for my flight. I try to checkin and am told to go to another line and talk to someone else.. I wait a half hour before finally talking to someone and she tells me the flight is overbooked and United never officially reserved seat for me! She is on phone for 20 min or so while I am starting to cry at this point. She is able to get me a seat in the last row when I had been told by United I would have a good seat by the window for all my trouble. I'm so happy I'm going home I don't care.. Until I spend the 3.5 hour flight listening to the flight attendants bitch (excuse my language but that is exactly what they were doing) about their job, customers on the flight, how tired they were yesterday and if something happened their reaction time would be off, a pilot demanding ginger ale for his alcoholic drink, and complaining about people using the bathroom. My god, I left the plane with a full bladder so they didn't have one more thing to talk about. I think I would've rather drove the 2400 miles. United somewhat reimbursed me but this is on US Airways.

I love it here! They have great craft beer (especially in the fall- Pumpkin Porter) and delicious food. Parking sucks, but it's worth the walk and the wait if you come around 5:30/6:00.

Even when there aren't many people here, I still end up having fun. It is close to my apartment so a quick go-to but would come even if it wasn't. Staff is attentive and drinks are great!

I lived in Arizona for over 2 years and never found a nail salon I liked. Now I'm here visiting friends and happened to stop in and LOVED this place. I got so many compliments on my nails as well. I wish I would've found Mirage when I lived in AZ. Highly recommended!!

The bed was filthy here and the girls at front desk aren't very friendly. Not coming back.

This place has wonderful sushi AND service! You get soba noodles free to start and an orange to end the meal. The prices are good and rolls are huge. I will be coming back again.

I have never wrote a review but I was appalled at the service here yesterday (5/31/13) at lunch. I was with someone and we were literally one of the first people in the door at 11am and didn't get our food for a good 45 minutes. I was on my lunch break and not once did the server come over to apologize as the restaurant filled up and other patrons came and left after already eating. After finally getting food he just dropped it in front of us, cold and walked away. I have been a server before and I think that's why it bothered me the most, knowing what I would have done in his situation, at least apologizing for the wait or even sending over a manager. I was late getting back to my office due to coming in at 11am and not able to leave until 1230 after shoveling the food in my mouth. I would come back, but if I had the same server, ask for someone else.

Came here yesterday for a late dinner and drink and was impressed. I had thought this was only breakfast and my dinner was delicious. They have a great happy hour and list of beers to choose. I would come back again and want to try it for breakfast as well. Only downside was they close at 9 and felt a little rushed to leave starting around 8pm. As a former server, I understand but others might not.

Sounds like I have the exact same experience as everyone else - package from Amazon.. not delivered. It was supposed to be delivered by Monday and I wait and wait all day and at 9pm it says will try again next business day. So I stay home again waiting and have text messaging alert me that package was signed for and delivered Tuesday at 4:30pm... really?! It said it was delivered to front door. I live in condos and there isn't a front door - I had left the gate code and phone number in delivery instructions so not sure why that was used. I contacted Ontrac and Amazon. Amazon refunded my money but Ontrac has not gotten back with me. How can they continue to stay in business?? I will not order from Amazon again if they ship through Ontrac!

Update: my apartment building was getting painted 8 months after placing my order and not getting delivered from OnTrac.. Well, turns out it was delivered. Painters found in the bushes. I live on the 3rd floor, curious how that would happen if they didn't just throw it at the building. Package was water damaged.

This store is sadly now closed. It is right around the corner and I stopped in a couple times a week. It was never crowded and employees were friendly. I would've definitely continued to stay a loyal customer!

I saw the review from almost a year ago mentioning the owner yelling at one of the workers and took it with a grain of salt and decided to check it out anyways. I wasn't a foot in the door and witnessed this. Someone who treats others that way doesn't deserve to be in business. I won't be back.

I've only been here for brunch, on 3 separate occasions and while it is a great deal for $15 bottomless mimosas, I think I will be going somewhere else next time. Every single server has been crappy or rude.  I've worked as a server and wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but some comments are uncalled for. Maybe I will check it out at night or sit at the bar during the day but never again want a server.

Called on a Sunday and had 2 doors unlocked within the half hour. Great service and excellent price. Knock on wood I won't lose my keys again, but if I do, I know who I will be calling!

Did you know there is a such thing as happy hour on a Saturday? I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I had good things from friends but driving past I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The server (Amanda) was great, food was excellent, and the drinks were delicious. I will definitely be coming back!

Meghan is great - definitely recommend going to her. I generally sit down and tell her to do what she wants and end up loving it. I recently moved across the country and still go back to her when I am in town. I don't want to find anyone new!

This was a lot smaller inside than I expected but they have a patio I will definitely check out when it's cooler. Came on a Tuesday at 5:30 and told we had a 20 minute wait but it ended up more like 45 minutes. Not a big deal since we brought our drinks outside. The margaritas tasted fresh and are on special for $5 on Tuesdays along with tacos. I'll be coming back!

This is my second time buying from R&S and still just as pleased. The first time was at the Tempe location. I came in straight from Ohio needing a bed and left within 15 minutes and delivery set up for the next day. Cody was very helpful at the store and then Justin and Ignacio were great with the delivery. Very quick and friendly. Hopefully I won't be needing 2 beds again in a 3 year time span but if I do, I'll be coming here!
