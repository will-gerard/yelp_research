Worst dentist office in town. It's raining today and I was driving down the freeway when my window blew out. Glass everywhere as I'm driving 60 mph. I pulled off the freeway to reschedule my appointment. They tell me even after my life was put in danger by an act of god that they are going to charge me $75 to reschedule. I told them I had to think about rescheduling and they had the nerve to ask when I would know. These people don't care about you or your mouth. All they care about is money. Do not bring your business to this facility.

This is one of the best vapor dispensers in the valley. They always help my grandfather and my mother with whatever they need help with. I went in there yesterday; Samantha and Alan hooked me up. I'm in aspiring filmmaker with little to no money usually, I didn't have enough money to purchase what I needed. They paid the remainder of what I could not afford out of their own pockets. If that doesn't spell customer service I have no idea what does. If you're in the valley order your vapor juice and all of your vapor accessories through Xtreme Vapour. If it's not close to where you live or if you're not located in the valley you can purchase their items online and if you spend over $25 you get free shipping.

Haven't gotten the food yet. It has taken this place almost two hours to make two sandwiches and drive them to my apartment that's a mile down the street from the shop. Totally unacceptable.

I didn't get a chance to try this place because it's currently closed for refurbishments. The owner should reflect this on Yelp. Pretty much went out of my way to check this place out.
