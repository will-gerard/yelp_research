The wings were excellent. I had the gourmet works pizza. I wasn't too thrilled with it, but it wasn't nasty. The service was great. And the place is clean. I would go back here!

I was referred to this auto mechanic by my daycare director at the time. I have a car that's almost 9 years old and has 215k + miles on it. I let them know I am new to the state and need a reliable and trust worthy mechanic. I also let them know I am not in a position to replace my car, so I need to take care of it best I can. I have sent my car there 3 times now and all 3 times I have been very satisfied with their rates and service. They keep track of my repairs and send me reminders for my oil changes. They also give me suggestions for repairs. I am able to rest easy when I have to get repairs done knowing they are using their best experts to advise me and aren't the type of mechanic to overcharge me for labor. They also give a very detailed receipt so I can see what costs the most for each repair. Love this place!

I recently held a banquet here for my mother's 50th birthday. It was recommended that I use Valle Luna because they are easy to work with. I made a couple visits to the restaurant before booking the banquet. What had me sold was their beautiful view from their back patio. I was able to set up the menu for the banquet. They answered all of my questions. What really had me sold was on the day of the banquet I had an excellent server called Ricky. I can tell Ricky is a pro. He made sure to ask me all the questions he needed to help me make the party run smoother. There was a very small mix up with a menu item we ordered and he resolved it very quickly. Ricky really made the party. I was able to focus on the guest of honor and other party guests. The service was good and the food was excellent. Everything tasted good and there was enough food for everyone. They were even able to accommodation a last minute desert order. I will consider using Valle Luna again for a banquet!

The staff is friendly and helpful. They had me and my two sons done in 40 minutes for a well visit. Dr Jones is the bomb.com. She is on top of everything and knows her stuff. She is great with my sons who to me are super hyper. Im glad to have found them.

Okay. My first trip here in a while was breakfast time. They asked me to pull in front to wait on my hash browns. 6 minutes later I had my food. Usually when fast good places make you wait too long, they give you bigger fries. But not this place. My second trip there (the next day) I had to wait 10 minutes for my food which was also at breakfast time. Despite how delicious their breakfast menu is, I won't be back here for a while.

When I think of a place to go for a drink I didn't think of Applebee's but I'm glad I went. They have great drinks and friendly service. The waitress we had removed a drink from my receipt even though I drank the whole drink that I didn't really like. She made sure our glasses were never empty and our food was served hot. They have ladies night every week and kids eat free I think on Tuesday or Wednesday's. I'll be back!

This was my first visit to this Apple Bee's location. As usual, they have menu options for just about everyone (the skinny, the big and the rich and the poor). The hockey championship game was playing so the bar was full. There was also a 21st birthday party there which was pretty cool. Our waiter was great. He was also waiting on the party, but he made sure to check in with us as often as he could. He check in with us a few times about our food which was a little weird. I guess the way it works is if we order an appetizer it delays the time our entree's come out which is fine. We were in no rush. We had made it just in time for the last 30 minutes of happy hour. The one thing that was also a little weird about our waiter is that he mentioned that he used to work at TGI Fridays and that they all closed down because business was not good. To me, that's not a small talk topic for a party you are waiting on. I ordered the chicken and shrimp fajitas. I didn't realize that it does not come with rice on the side, but the rice is really not needed. They give you the chicken, shrimp, peppers and onions plus all the fixings for the fajitas (cheese, salsa, sour cream and softshells). That filled me up.  Otherwise, it seemed like a typical AppleBee's nothing exceptional about it, and there is no reason why I would not go back.

Where do I start. Upon arriving, we signed in and were told there was a one hour wait. The reason I did not rate them a 5 is due to the long wait and lack of standing room for those waiting. Otherwise, the experience was excellent. Our server was Monique and she was hospitable and friendly. We asked her for suggestions and she gave us genuine responses. Although it was busy, she did not rush us. The amazing part was that our food took no longer than 10 minutes to arrive. I was blown away. They have a large menu, but are still able to complete orders in such a short amount of time. And the food was hot and tasty. I ordered the smothered chicken and yams and fried okra. The chicken was mouth watering. I could not eat it all. I will definitely be going back. I didn't order waffles this time, but I will when I go back.

The selection is of a normal subway. The first breakfast sandwich I got here was kind of cold and it wasn't supposed to be. The server was friendly

If I could give this place no stars, I would. I was once very fond of this place. That was until they changed directors.   They aren't consistent with sending home daily reports with the children. I'm the kind of parent that likes to know how my kids did in daycare. I like to know the good and the bad. When they sent home reports, hey would say "had a great day!" Well, what made their day so great? Also, they would send home a good report, but when I talk with the teacher, they would tell me how bad my child was. I asked why it wasn't on the reports I received and they said they write the reports mid day. How backwards is that? There are some teachers there who really seemed to care, but there seems to be too many cooks in the kitchen. The management team would often refer to "the owners" but when I asked who the owners were they said they don't distribute that information. Huh?! If someone is going to be around my children, I want to know who they are! They do have a clean facility. They also have a lot of different daily activities for the children to play with. But they need better trained staff. All of their teachers are not certified.   Also, I had an issue with kids bullying my son. They didn't try to resolve it. I requested a meeting with he kids parents because most people know that one major factor in resolving bullying is with the help of all parents involved. Well, they out right ignored me. I won't be making a recommendation for this daycare to anyone.

The management staff here is very good. Sometimes I do have to call twice on a maintenance request but they have the issue resolved within 24 hours. They only downside is the neighbors. The management has a 10 pm quiet rule and some tenants dont follow that on the weekends. They have 2 pools here that anyone rarely uses and laundry rooms, vending machines and even a water machine. No gym, but there are plenty of areas to take walks. Oh and they have a playground too for kids.

I had my first visit here last week and it was the best. I was worried about the outcome because I wasn't sure how good or bad my vision was. The assistant that completed all of my tests was very helpful. She was patient and thorough with explaining everything. The doctor, Beth, was very informative and helpful. I can tell she is passionate about her profession. I asked about bringing my children in and they gave me everything I needed to do so. They even made my appointment for me for a specialist I have to see. Everyone was super friendly and knowledgeable. I didn't have to get frames, but they also have a large selection of frames and contact lenses. It's like a one stop shop for your eyeballs.

This was my first visit to this location. As always, the food was great. However, the service was less than stellar. The waiters name was Ernesto and he was really creepy. He talked under his breath and he made checking in on us awkward because he kept walking away while talking to us. I just disregarded it because I didn't want it to get any weirder, but I ended up leaving him half the tip I usually leave an iHop waitperson. Also, when we first walked in, they were working on a vent towards the front door and there was cardboard and dust on the floor. That grossed me out. I gave it a high review because the food was good and reasonably priced.

Bobby Q has being in the restaurant business down pat. When you first walk in, it seem sort of up scale. The waitress we had seemed new, but was very nice and was sure to remember everything. The food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time and was tasty. I had their Fish Fry Friday and I think the fish could have been seasoned a little more. I found myself using more of the tartar sauce because of the lack of seasoning on the fish. They do this thing with homemade donuts which I think is a great happy ended. I am the type of person that does need a little bit of sweet at the end of my meal and that was perfect.

So, one day my co-worker asks me if I want the other half of her breakfast burrito. Being the nice co-worker I am, I say yes. I ate the half of burrito around 10am. I was not hungry until nearly dinner time. Not only was the burrito very filling but it was delicious. Even without salsa, the burrito was seasoned very well and you can tell it was homemade versus being typical fast food. Ever since then, when I have $4 I head over for a breakfast burrito to eat for breakfast and lunch. I had their chicken enchiladas as a platter for lunch and the green salsa was so yummy. For $8 I got 3 homemade enchiladas, nachos, re-fried beans, and rice. El Taco Tote is a great place for a lunch or dinner date. It's not formal like Friday's or Carraba's but if you don't have a bunch of money but want great Mexican food, this is the place to be.

So, my family and I had a long evening. We had some unexpected errands to run and needed a bite to eat. I didn't want to get fast food and I knew most pizza places make their pizza fresh. Upon entering Brothers I noticed they had 2-3 huge televisions, plenty of dining space, and beer on draft. My kind of place. They had a special for an XL pizza and 25 wings for $22. I ordered that plus drinks. I ordered a pint and a half of beer which was $5. While we wait for the pizza, I watched an NBA game. Our food came out hot and in a reasonable amount of time. The service was great. I kick myself for not taking a picture, but the wings looked sick. The sauce for the wings was great, but most of the wings were damaged goods. They were broken before they were cooked therefore they were filled with cooked blood which was GROSS. They were fried hard which was fine, but man, I had such a hard time getting past the BLOOD. At one point, I bit into a wing and was chewing bone because the bone for that wing broke into pieces prior to them cooking it. I am thinking they got this batch of wings off the back of an abandoned chicken truck or something. Even my kids did not want to eat the wings because they had dark spots on them. The pizza was okay. I will not be going back to this place because my two favorite menu items were not tasty. It stinks because the guys who served us were great. And they had other items on the menu such as pastas and calzones. But the pizza crust was hard to bite into. The sauce for the pizza was good though. Sorry, Brothers. Not a satisfied customer. I should have read the reviews before putting my car in park for this one.

This location was great. They were quick friendly and helpful. They are cheaper than most locations, but probably because they are technically in the hood.

On 2/17/13, I took my family here to eat. This would have been my first visit here. Upon our arrival, I knew there was going to be a long wait because it was Sunday afternoon. However, after 5 minutes of standing in line we were asked to leave without a valid reason. One worker said they were running out of food but another said their bathrooms were not working. When I was standing in line I noticed their soda machine was leaking all over the floor near the front of the line. There were paper towels covering it up. Also, for the little bit of time we were in line, the line barely moved. I wont' be going back to this location!

I bought a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com to come here. It was for dinner but I showed up at lunch trying to use it. At first they told me they weren't going to accept it but they did anyway but then also said they are no longer honoring my other 2 I bought. The service was great. The atmosphere was great as well. My bill even with the $25 off was about $75, but I bought about 8-10 rolls of sushi. They didn't bring all the rolls out at once which was smart of them to do. They even have chicken sushi (with cooked chicken). I would love to go back to this place, but I can't as often because it's far from where I actually live.

Okay so I made two visits here, so far. And yes, I will be going back.  Visit #1 - Dinner time I wasn't sure what to expect. When you first enter, they acknowledge your presence and ask you to seat yourself. A server then comes and takes your drink order. I ordered the green tea, which, by the way, is literally green. It is yummy. So, then another server comes out with Miso soup, crab salad and green beans. These come with any order for free. So after eating the yummy free stuff, I was ready for sushi. You can either order by the roll, or get all you can eat for $19.95. So, since I was ordering 2 rolls that added up to $18, I went with the all you can eat. I ordered the Vegas Roll, Soft Shell Crab roll and the Crazy Roll. They were all very delicious. And they staggered the delivery of the rolls. I was with my kids so I got them some ice cream. No complaints about the service or food!  Oh and when you get the all you can eat, you get a free appetizer. So, I picked the dumplings which they serve pan fried.  Visit #2 - Lunch time So, my expectations were set to order a couple rolls that cost around $12. Well, wouldn't ya know it they have a lunch time special where all rolls are half off. I ordered 5 rolls for $20 (lunch was for 2). They have special menus pre planned for the all you can eat and half off lunch specials, but if there is a roll that isn't on the list, for the most part you can ask and they will make it. Just make sure to tip the chef. I ordered my usual rolls plus the dragon roll. Yummy!

Islands burgers is great. They were able to accommodation a large party on their patio. The server was patient and fast. I had 2 drinks and onion rings. The onion rings were tasty and hot. Also, I had a chocolate lava dessert which was too much for one person but it was good. I also had to share the onion rings. My friends said they loved their food as well. I will definitely be going back to try a burger.

I decided to step outside of our normal American food places and we ended up at Nakama. I was a little skeptical because it was a lounge and I had my two young sons with but I figured since happy hour was over we should be okay.  Nakama was a little hard to find because there is no sign on the main road (McDowell) but my GPS is sharp. Upon entering the restaurant, my first impression was that it was very dark. The colors of the place are red and black. The greeter immediately greeted us with a welcoming smile and we were seated right away. At first, I thought that was a good thing, but then again it made me wonder "Why is there no wait?" I was excited to see we were seated at a big table, but then when the appetizer was brought out, it proved to be a bad idea because we had to get up to pass the food back and forth to each other. The waitress was very tentative and friendly. She brought us refills well before we needed them which avoided us having to go thirsty. I loved that my sons were allowed to share a kids meal at no extra charge. They ordered the chicken strips and fries. My sons do eat sushi but since it was a new place for them, I ordered them their own food to safe.  I ordered the monkey brains appetizer and it tasted wonderful. For checking in on Yelp, we got free Edeme. They were hard to open up and salty so I only ate a few. I did like they were warm. Once the appetizer was done, our rolls came out. We ordered the teriyaki chicken, the baked scallop (BSCR) roll and the shrimp killer roll.  I was not a huge fan of the chicken roll. I picked it to be safe but it didn't taste right wrapped up in a role with rice. I had to get used to their use of soy paper. I miss my seaweed.  To drink I ordered the iced green tea and that tasted as usual. All in all, it was a great experience. Oh and the bathrooms were clean and smell great. I consider that a plus because some places do not keep up with their restrooms because they don't think it's as important as the rest of the restaurant. I could also see the kitchen on my way to and from the restroom and it looked very organized and clean. There was a full bar which is great for their Happy Hour. I will definitely go back. I am excited to have found a great sushi place in the West Valley!

Kudos to this location for pulling of a great fundraising event for my sons elementary school. I only attended this location because my son's school used them for a fundraiser. 10% of the sales were being donated to an elementary school. I opted to park and dine in because it has an indoor play ground. The parking lot is pretty small. They share a lot with a plaza which has at least 2-3 more stores. The drive through access is a little awkward, but what fast food place isn't now-a-days.   Anyway, upon entering I initially thought long line, long wait. Well, they had workers stationed all throughout the restaurant to offer assistance which was very helpful. I was able to find a table for my family and the manager made sure to bring my food which is not usual for a fast food place. I was impressed. There was not much moving space in the dining area. I am not sure if they added more tables because of the event or not. There was staff always visible cleaning and assisting the guests which was great. The food quality was good. They got my order correct and it was still hot when I was eating it.

I ordered a cake from KAK and it was PERFECT.  I did not have a grand vision for the cake. I just knew my mom loves pocket books and some of her favorite colors are brown and green. The staff and KAK took whatever time needed to make sure to ask me questions about my cake order. They are friendly and easy to talk to. I gave my cake order in person and followed up with a few phone calls. They even called me to make sure they had it right. The customer service was excellent. When I picked up the cake, they gave me good instructions for transporting it. However, the best part was the look on my mom's face when she saw the cake. We had the cake on display during her birthday party. Strangers kept asking us if the cake was real because it was in the shape of a pocketbook. Lastly, the taste of the cake was perfect. I went with the  red velvet and cream cheese. The cake itself was heavy which mean to me a rich batter. Everyone that tasted the cake loved it. I will definitely be using KAK again for any cake I need!

So, my most recent visit to my newly favorite lunch place was da bomb. Instead of my usual calamari sandwich and sweet potato fries I got the Mongolian beef with lime curry sauce. Now, usually Jamaican's don't fancy lime in their curry. But I had my grandmother turning over in her grave on Thursday because I really enjoyed the taste of the lime curry sauce, beef, beans and rice. I especially liked that the dish had cilantro in it, but not too much. One thing I noticed about Hula's while I was there is the music. It was loud enough for me to hear it but not too loud to hold a conversation. Our server was great. She kept our glasses filled and checked on us regularly but was not a bug-a-boo. I ate inside this time instead of outside and it made me realize how much I prefer eating outside here. I got to meet the owner, Dana, who is a cool down to earth guy. Until next time!

I took my family here for dinner about a week ago. The one thing I was disappointed with is their salad bar selection. I used to frequent Ruby Tuesday's years ago and their selection was larger. However, I guess since their salad bar selection is smaller, they offer more food menu items. I ordered the flavored iced tea and I was impressed that the server mixes it up for me in person. I also love the shrimp dip appetizer. I ordered the chicken broccoli. It was delicious. I know next time to have my sons split a food dish instead of getting their own. Our server was prompt and polite. We left there stuffed.

Great place to work and great place to attend for school. Campus life for the students is great. There is always something for them to do and a huge focus on academics. The basis of the school is servant leadership and that is demonstrated through their community outreach and their appreciation of their employees year round.

While there are times the food is a little stale and dry, most of the time it is fresh and yummy. What trumps the food most of the time is the service. The workers here are very friendly and fast. Plus, their outside speaker works VERY well. I never have to repeat myself and they always get my order right. They usually don't have specials but they do have new menu items on a regular basis.

Even though this place is usually packed, they have their lunch rush down to the tee. By the time I am done paying for my order, within a couple minutes it's ready for me to pick up. I usually just stick to ordering a sandwich because the add-on's tend to get a bit expensive for me. I love their italian sandwich. I look forward to coming back.

I was not impressed by this chinese buffet. The only things that were good were the sushi and the location. The servers only speak enough english to serve you. And their food offerings are of very low quality. Their prices are way too high for the lack of food quality. They had crab legs that were so tiny, I could barely get the meat out of them. Also, their fried rice tasted like dirt. Their chicken was dry (except for the chicken on a stick). I won't be going back here at all.

First let me say the portions this place serves are HUGE. My first visit here was with my boss for a lunch meeting. I ordered the pesto pasta bowl. YUMMY. I ate as much as I could and still had enough for lunch again the next day. My kids loved the bread bowl. I had the happy ending infamous cookie dough ice cream. Loved it all. I will have to bring my kids with me next time I visit because I see that they give the kids pizza dough to play with while they wait for their food.

On a whim, I stopped in to GiGi's to see what their cupcakes were like. I was at first taken back by the price of each cupcake (at the time it was $4.50 per cupcake); however I was quickly distracted by their variety of flavors. I decided on the birthday cake flavor because it was recently my brother's birthday. When we finally tasted the cupcakes, they were amazing. The texture of the icing was perfect. It was not too heavy or light. And the actual cupcake was moist and tasty. The birthday cake flavor was in the icing. If I am in the area again I will definitely stop in for a cup cake or two. Also, the service was excellent. Even thought it was a little busy, the counter person was still polite and patient.
