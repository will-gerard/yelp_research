I can't say that I get my nails done a lot, so I'm probably not the best judge of nail salons. That being said, when I do get my nails done, it tends to be at Allure Nails at the Scottsdale Promenade. They have reasonable prices, do a pretty decent job and they usually can have walk-in's seated within 15 minutes.   After all my experiences with Allure Nail spa, it makes me sad to have to write a negative report as my first review for them. The plan was that two of my friends were going to treat me to lunch and a manicure, but they were very finicky when selecting a nail salon. They called multiple places to find a salon that could handle 3 nail reservations at the same time, so that none of us were sitting in the waiting area alone, or for one person to be sitting and waiting because they finished before the other two. They called Allure and were told that this was completely possible and that they could accommodate us.  It could be that we're naïve and there really is no place that can do what we were looking for, but it was very disappointing to have been told it was possible and then to walk in and find out they can't. Not only couldn't they deliver on what they had said, but when we arrived our reservation was actually pointless because all the nail techs were busy. We ended up sitting and waiting for 20 minutes even though we had reservations andthen we ended up doing the waiting game that the reservations were supposed to prevent.   The manicures were nice (3 stars), but the disappointment of Allure not delivering what they promised has led me to give them 1star.

This location has to be my favorite Barnes & Noble. I have 3 bookstores that are closer to my house than this one, 2 of which are actually other Barnes & Noble. I don't care if it's a longer drive for me, because this is MY bookstore.   This place relaxes me the moment I walk through the door. The faint scent of coffee, the music piping in through the speakers and the rustle of pages turning put me into a completely Zen mood no matter how I was feeling before I entered the store.  Another reason why this is my favorite location is because of their huge windows that look over Kierland Commons. During the summer there are dancing fountains in the center and little kids run through them and during the winter I get the closest to a white Christmas feeling that one can get in a place where it doesn't snow.   Many winter days I would grab a seat on the second floor overlooking the huge Christmas tree in Kierland Commons, with a caramel apple cider from the Starbucks inside the store. The jolly Christmas music coming through the speakers is the cherry on top of the Sunday. I really want to come in with a big fluffy blanket and a warm pair of socks but I think that might earn me some strange looks. Maybe one day....

5 stars all the way.   Let me begin by saying that I'm a big fan of the products. The store is done in very warm tones and the drinks are incredibly aromatic and these 2 things combines seem to make all my stress melt away when I step in the door.   I'm not a huge coffee fan, but I can order some of the coffee drinks here. I'm completely unable to drink the caramel frappuccino from Starbucks, but I can't get enough of the caramel ice blended from Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.  So now that we've established that I love the product, we can move on to the real reason this place gets a 5 star review--the staff. I've never seen anything like it. If you come in 3-7 times someone will probably know your name and might even know your drink.  Leila is the best at this. She knows peoples names, their drinks and if you come there often enough she even knows which car you drive. She'll see a regular customer's car pull up and she'll have the normal drink ready and waiting for them by the time they walk through the door. THAT is the epitome of customer service.

This place really does have such a relaxed atmosphere. I've been there with both friends and family for their happy hour and it's just such a pleasant experience overall.   Drink-wise I'm absolutely partial to their Sangria but I also love their Crazy Cuban. Their Crazy Cuban is a lovely mix of Mt. Gay Eclipse, Cruzan Coconut, 99 Bananas, and pineapple.  Tommy Bahamas is actually weakest in the food department in my opinion. The fish tacos have gotten the best reviews from my panel but it's a smaller amount of food for a good bit of money.  What really has me writing this review is their desserts...well, one dessert in particular. I love their Piña Colada Cake so much that I haven't been able to try anything else because I can't bring myself to order anything else. It's so tropical and has the flavor of a rich dense cake while still being as light and fluffy as a cloud.  I have my suspicions of how they accomplish this feat, but as far as I know they suse a vanilla cake doused in rum, with layer of a light and fluffy white chocolate mousse with diced pineapple in between. On the outer rim of this cake is a very light application of shaved coconut. Now normally, I'm not a fan of coconut and I would just remove whatever coconut I could from the cake, but on this one it's really a nice compliment.  Overall: food is decent, but the drinks and the ambiance more than make up for it. If you do go and you like tropical flavors, you MUST try the Piña Colada Cake.

So I had quite a hard time deciding whether or not to give this hotel 3 stars or 4 stars, but I ended up going with 4 stars based on the things that the hotel provided for people just staying in the hotel.  I really don't have many complaints regarding the hotel at all. The casino was kept very clean and had a nice open feel that kept you from feeling like you were a sardine. The only thing sucked about the casino was the smell of smoke, but that's not something you can avoid. The pools that I did see were awesome, but I didn't get a chance to go to the "toptional" pool ($30 admission to "toptional" pool).   The rooms were amazing. Huge windows overlooked different parts of Vegas and the rooms were kept very clean and fresh. The bathrooms were very spacious and sported a huge soaker tub and a large glass shower. The biggest selling point for the bathrooms were the (slightly-outdated) TV's they had mounted that you could see from the tub. One small drawback to the room is that all the doors make a ton of noise, so there is no way to quietly move around the room without waking up the other people in your room. Also, the toilets make as much noise as those found on an airplane, so make sure you use the toilet prior to anyone going to sleep.  The part that almost made them give me give them a 3 star review is the way they handled the business conference I was part of. Our first meetings were at 7:45am (not that early) and all 200 of us had to eat and be seated between 7:30 and 7:45. Well the hotel only has one restaurant and a Starbucks that are open before 7:00am and the hotel apparently didn't warn the restaurant that we were coming because they were only staffed with 2 waitresses. My company completely overwhelmed the starbucks because the restaurant wasn't moving fast enough.   Conferences aren't anything special and they really need to figure out how to handle that kind of capacity. Besides the business conference side of things, the hotel is overall wonderful and a great place in Vegas.  Tip: Go to their House of Blues restaurant. It's delicious!!! See my review :)

I going to squeeze 2 experience into 1 review for the House of Blues. I was on a business trip and staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel and the very first night I was there, the head of my region decided to treat everyone to a meal at the House of Blues. The waitresses and waiters successfully and quickly handled our entire group in a coordinated effort and made sure our glasses were always full and that all of the food was hot when it arrived at our table. No small feat considering we were a group of over 30.  I wasn't feeling too adventurous so i just ordered a burger, but the burger was cooked very well and the options of what you could add to the burgers were very extensive. My entire group was happy with the food, but if the waitresses says the dish is on the small side, please take her on her word. The Cobb salad was humungous and I will give a second-hand review of "delicious".  I had such a good experience the first night that when another, smaller group of co-workers asked me if I wanted to go, I immediately said yes. I went with a group of 4 and got their House of Blue salad and a side order of Sweet potatoes fries (because I just couldn't say no). I was just as pleased the second time around with the food and the service. The best part of the second night was the fact that they had several TV's and it was easy to see game 4 of the NBA Finals. Unfortunately the Miami Heat still won.

I've been coming to this location for years. I went to Israel in the summer of 2006 and when I came back to the states I refused to eat hummus because I didn't want to replace the memory of the amazing, authentic hummus I ate in Israel with some crappy hummus that you get in the grocery store.   I didn't have hummus for over a year until I discovered Pita Jungle. their hummus (all 3 kinds) is the most authentic that I've found outside of Israel and New York.   2 months ago I brought my roommate who professed to hate hummus to pita jungle. By the end of dinner she was stealing all my hummus.  Since the beginning of my interactions with pita jungle there is one thing that I have eaten the most frequently. The Fruit Fantasia (a plate of fruit and cheese) and the hummus starter. I'm going to let you in on a little secret: apples and hummus are delicious together.   For the more adventurous people reading this try dipping the banana and the cheeses in to the hummus as well. YUMMMMM!  The only reason why I give it a 4 is because they give less fruit and cheese than they used to. It used to be the best deal going because I could make 2 meals out of the platter for something like $8. Now it's $10 for the Fruit fantasia and I only get 1.5 meals out of it. Still worth it though.  Bonus points: They have many healthy options for those people who are trying to watch what they eat.

I am a carbivore. My favorite foods are all carbs and as a result I end up eating a lot of Italian. So naturally, I've been to Maggiano's several times.  One thing holds true every time I go to Maggiano's--I always enjoy their appetizers more than their entrees. I don't think their entrees are bad, but I also don't think they're anything special. Their appetizers on the other hand are delicious.  My personal favorites happen to be their caprese, the stuffed mushrooms and the mushroom ravioli. Being a carbivore, as I mentioned before, my favorite is of course the mushroom ravioli. Everytime I go here with someone I always order the mushroom ravioli and make my guest try it. I haven't had a single person say it was "eh" or "average". This one dish has gotten a 4/5 or above from everyone who has tried it. I even had someone who didn't like mushrooms going back for more.  I think I'll have to go there for lunch today...

I came here last Saturday night with my family and I'm not sure what we were thinking but we didn't try to make a reservation until 2:00pm. That left us with 2 options- 5:15 and 9:15. Neither were appealing, but I really wanted to try this restaurant, so we went with the 5:15 sitting. It certainly felt strange eating that early, but I quickly got over that once I started to taste the food.  The first problem I had with this restaurant was that everything looked so good. My family and I must have spent a good 10 minutes optimizing our order. We coordinated a strategic attack on the menu making sure that we got to try at least one thing form every part of the menu.  We started with a Bruschetta and the Pesto Flatbread. The bruschetta was alright, a little small in terms of portions but our waiter did try to tell us. It was the Pesto Flatbread was what everyone at our table fought over. It was much larger than the bruschetta and had the creamiest, most delicious goat cheese on top.   We then had a mixture of salads and entrees. I wasn't feeling all that hungry (remember- it was 5:15) so I just got a simple green salad. Let me tell you for $5 that was a pretty reasonable sized salad and their simple vinaigrette was very flavorful.  My family members were all very happy with their dishes as well (sweet potato cannelloni, big eyed tuna, and the natural chicken), but the real winner of the evening was the Sangria.  We ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria (tempranillo, cassis, blackberry, raspberry, strawberry) to start with and even considered ordering more. It had a lovely sweetness to it that came from the fruits and it was very addicting. I will definitely be ordering that again.  I can definitely see myself coming here again and trying their other salads and their white sangria too.

Appearance: 10/10 Taste: 10/10  Overall: 10/10  I can only think of one word to describe her chocolates: decadent!  I had no idea I was going to be eating Julia Baker chocolate today, but you can bet I was thrilled when I found out she was coming into our office today. Smart woman that she is she brought her chocolates with her.  The first one I tried was their caramel truffle: Heaven! The second one I had was the milk chocolate ganache:Scrumptious!  Warning: Do not eat at your desk. Eating might cause noises of delight.

Let me start out by saying their food was decent. I had the sweet and sour chicken and I thought it was pretty good but nothing special.   The reason for the 2 star review is their customer service. The other day I came into Flo's with 3 of my co-workers. We were greeted by a very kind hostess and immediately seated. We sat down and waited all of 30 seconds before our waiter came over and took our drink orders. He must have run to the kitchen and back because next thing we know, we all have drinks and he's taking our meal orders.  I bet you are wondering where the problem is....just wait, this is where it gets good. From that point on the waiter never came back to our table. Someone else delivered the food, we had to flag down a different waiter when the entire table was waiting for a refill. Worst of all, I had to chase down our waiter to get our check so that we wouldn't be late getting back to work. I literally had to race after him (in heels might I add) and I followed him all the way to the kitchen and then grabbed him as soon as he exited.  I've never been in a situation where I had to ask someone to bring us the check. Usually that's when the waiter is most on top of things.   Food: 7/10 Service: 2/10  Will I come back? I think I'll give them another chance, but this better not be consistent behavior.

Reading through these reviews makes me think that I may have been the only person to stumble upon the wonderful masterpiece that is NYPD's Baked Ziti.   Everyone listening? I'm reviewing their Baked Ziti NOT their pizza. It's the perfect combination of cheese, pasta and sauce. You get the rich flavor of their tomato sauce without being overwhelmed by it. The cheese is really the star of this dish and the sauce lets it shines.  The Pièce de résistance is the garlic knots that come on the side. Perfect addition to the best meal in the restaurant.  The reason why I say 4 out of 5 stars is because I can wait for quite a few minutes for are refill and to get the maximum enjoyment out of the meal I need to have my Diet Coke DURING the meal, not afterwords.

Simply put, I have never had a bad experience coming here. I've come here for happy hour, for dinner, for lunch, and I've even been to their Sunday brunch.  One Word: Amazing  My parents actually attended the soft opening and they told me that I HAD to come to Brio. Best advice my parents may have ever given me. I've come here for my last 2 birthday and that's a pretty high honor in my family.   The best part of Brio is that there is really something for everyone and for every food mood. When I'm feeling pasta I order the Pasta Alla Vodka or the Mushroom Ravioli. When I want to eat healthy I order one of their amazing salads (hint: their balsamic is delicious!!!). When I want meat i get their Mezza Chicken "under a brick"  One of the best things about Brio is their desserts. They offer some large "full size" desserts and they offer little dessert shots. There are some desserts that they always have, but they also add new ones from time to time. I appreciate the variety the offer.  Everyone I've taken here has loved it and I will swear by this restaurant

It's really hit or miss with the people at European Wax Center. The thing you need to do is find one person that does the waxing you like and then never lose them. Until you find that one person, things can be a bit hairy (hehe--sorry).   I get my eyebrows waxed pretty consistently but for 9 months of the year I'm in Tucson and the other 3 I'm in Scottsdale, so I actually have 2 girls who I trust.   Unfortunately, when I came back to Scottsdale in late May I found out my normal girl in Scottsdale no longer worked there. I was devastated. I really thought we had a good thing going on.   With no other options, I was forced to try seeing new people. The first 2 girls I saw were...let's say, not my style. I've found that if I don't like their eyebrows then I probably won't like mine when they're done with them. Sometimes I just want to have all the aestheticians line up and look at their eyebrows.   I finally found someone new and I couldn't be happier. I will continue to go to European Wax Center and visit my girls:  Whitney and Crystal

I have been very excited to try all the restaurants in the Scottsdale Quarter. After looking at all the restaurant's menus I decided to start at Parc Central. BIG MISTAKE  I went with my mom on a Friday at around 6pm. We walked in and were immediately greeted by a very bubbly woman at the front. She handed us off to another gentleman to lead us to our table. I was able to sit but he stood in front of my mother's chair as he was listing the specials, so she had to stand next to him during his entire spiel. A little strange, but alright.   The next part is what really irked me. When our waiter came to take our drink orders he was very friendly and warm and made lots of eye contact. As soon as we revealed we weren't ordering wine or a cocktail you could tell he was almost less excited to be our waiter. Then when we ordered our food and didn't order any of the dishes that were 35+ dollars he almost dismissed us. He refilled our waters pretty consistently but he said maybe 3 words to us after that. He never smiled and never made eye contact after taking our orders.   Just because we weren't having the most expensive dinner doesn't mean that you can treat us poorly. It wasn't like we were looking to buy the cheapest things on the menu. We just ordered salads and water! Not abnormal.  Side note: I had the Parc Central Salad (Field greens, walnut-whole grain granola & strawberry-brie dressing). It was fantastic. Very fresh and light and refreshing.

I've been to this restaurant once so far, and what I have to conclusively say is that I'm going to have to go back again.   The first time I went, it was with 2 previous co-workers who had already been to The Scottsdale Salad Co. Thank god they already knew about this place, because I'm not sure I would've ever walked in there on my own. It's situated right next to Corleone's (stiff competition) and right across from the Sprint Store on Northsight.  I was all set to get the Teriyaki wrap when the man behind the register (I believe he was the owner) managed to change my mind with just 2 words: burger. wrap.  It was like he was reading my mind. I had been craving a burger, but thought that a wrap might be healthier (I know this isn't necessarily true, but I truly believe in my delusions). So when he said those words in combination I knew the teriyaki didn't stand a chance.   The price wasn't bad, and the wrap was pretty tasty. It had a good balance of meat with lettuce and tomato with their delicious Scottsdale salad dressing all mixed together.   I have to go back just to find out what is in that Scottsdale Salad dressing, because it was delicious. Another reason I have to try it again is because of how many things looked good on that menu!   So first impressions were pretty good, I just need to find out if it's got consistency and whether it'll become my go-to healthy lunch place. I'll keep everyone updated.
