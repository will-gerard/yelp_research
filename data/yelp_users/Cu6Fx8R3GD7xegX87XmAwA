Went to see Dr. Nemanic when I was having some back and neck pain. He was quick to diagnose where my problem areas were, fixed them, and had solutions on how to take preventative measures moving forward. Also kept things short and simple within my busy day. Highly recommend.

The biggest thing I look for when doing anything auto related is trust and authenticity. The 5 star average review for Imperial was spot on. Dustin was extremely helpful and his crew was fast to act while providing an honest assessment on my vehicle. I will definitely be returning here for future auto needs.

Pizza was pretty tasty but overly oily and was dripping everywhere. The pizza was a 3 star, the service was a 5 star, so we will even it out and say it was a 4 star experience.

My experience at San Marin was quite mixed. While I did have some of the best times of my life here in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, there were so many things that set San Marin back from being the 5 star apartment complex that it has the potential to be. When we signed our initial lease in May of 2013, we received an unbelievable deal considering the location of these apartments. We signed a 12 month lease and the first few months were pure bliss. We were able to walk to the bars, walk to get some of the best food in the city, and the Scottsdale Fashion Mall is a quarter of a mile away. However, we then began to see the reason this place has a 2 star Yelp average. My car was towed from my own parking space after I bought my new car because I didn't have a parking sticker. On THREE separate occasions I had friends towed even with the parking pass placed on the dash like instructed. The reasons for the tow? That we tampered with the parking pass and our handwriting wasn't clearly legible.   For about 6 months of our 18 month stay in San Marin, our air conditioning unit continually dripped water from the ceiling. Despite us calling maintenance almost every week, the problem wasn't fixed until about 2 months before we moved out.  Lastly, the worst part of my entire stay was the leaking ceilings directly above my bed. During the monsoon season with heavy rains, I was awoken one night the pitter-patter of water falling all over my laptop, cell phone, hard drive, and iPad. My king size matter was nearly totaled as well. Needless to say, I told management who cared little about the situation and didn't have anything fixed by the next time I was rained on again IN MY OWN BED a month later.   It is not possible to give San Marin one star because the location is that incredible and the apartments are of decent quality. However, the careless management, the partnership that they share with a local towing company, and the utilities that fall apart bring San Marin far from the potentially amazing resort-like apartment complex that they could be.

Been to Joe's as far back as a couple of years ago and as recently as yesterday. The atmosphere is ideal if you are visiting Gilbert as it is the perfect representation of this town (farmy, sunny, a lot of real estate). The food is great as well. My Only complaint is the pricing. It can be a bit pricey compared to the market. Other than price, everything is fantastic. Will be back soon!

Along with Cartel, this is my favorite coffee shop in the entire metro Phoenix area. Enthusiastic and friendly service, great coffee, and a beautifully made breakfast burrito. If it wasn't a little out of the way I would be spending quite a bit of time/money here.

Lifetime was a place I grew up going to, full of positive vibes and unforgettable memories. I'm not sure if it is the careless employees or the manure/body odor smell but things are just different here now, not to mention they keep raising the prices of membership. Fortunately, there are many great gyms around the area where you are more than a number strictly there to produce revenue for a hungry salesperson.

The reviews were spot on for this one - solid but not amazing. I tried a server recommended crepe and it was okay. Basic ingredients, tasty but nothing special. The turtle latte I read about was a little subpar compared to the raving reviews ive seen on here about it. The server really nice, but a little slow. Also couldn't break a $20 for me, but understandable. The atmosphere was the best part which is why I bumped up from a 3 star. Unique tables and chairs, newspapers available and positive vibes. Will be back to try some of the sweet crepes.

Don't get me wrong, the food here is awesome. The reason this review is only 2 stars is because of the service. I have ordered pick up or delivery from this location at least 15 times during the past 2 months. The employees are nice people, but their delivery service is horrendous. Nearly every delivery has been missing 1 of 3 things. 1) The delivery person has no change for a $20. 2) They forget the chips. 3) They get your order wrong (like today, when I order the same thing every time). This is the reason I have been going elsewhere lately. Hopefully they can improve their delivery services.

Went to this Wetzel's Pretzels located at San Tan Village because I had a couple of coupons for a buy one, get one and a free pretzel dip. Disappointing experience. Service was grumpy and was not engaging, and I did not feel welcome into the shop. I made my order and while going to bag my order, the cashier dropped my bag onto the floor and proceeded to pick up that same bag and use it for my pretzels and dip. When I arrived back at work to enjoy the food, I was surprised to find that my "cheddar cheese sauce" was a dark goldenrod colored substance that was crusty and smelled nothing like what I would expect. Will not go to this shop again.

Pomegranate's quality is second to none. I enjoy the lumberjack for breakfast and the bountiful bowl for lunches and dinner. Have also tried their pancakes which are amazing. There is always great ambiance with pleasant music playing, self aware and health conscious people inhabiting, and fascinating employees. My only complaint is the price. Most of the types of juices made here are offered elsewhere a little cheaper. But the quality is truly their greatest value and for that, I will continue to come back here every time I swing by good ole Ahwatukee!

I'll keep it short and simple: this place is so damn good. The pico is the only thing I have eaten here and it is all I need. They also serve beer and have a great check on offer. Easy 5

I've now been here 4 times and I swear it gets better every time. Today I enjoyed the Geno's Famous Philly (keep in mind I have never been a big fan of Philly cheesesteaks) and it was one of the best meals I have had in a while. Add in the fact that there is a 20% check in offer and I will soon be the Duke of this place!

I have generally been a big fan of El Hefe for a while - I would eat lunch there on my break, attend happy hours and head out there for a night on the town. Back in those goo days I would have rated this place at 4 stars. But the last few times I have been here to go out, the guy bartenders have acted like the roided out frat bros they truly are. Not only have I been overcharged for drinks two weekends in a row, but when I confronted the bartender about it this time he started yelling and cursing at me in front of my two friends (I bought 3 drinks) about how wrong I was. Bad experience to say the least.   The only reason this place isn't a 1 star business now is because the front door man Taylor is a class act and a true professional when dealing with issues as opposed to the primal animals behind the bar. He is the only reason my friends and I might come back in the future.

Great food, great employees, and freaky fast, just like advertised. I go here nearly every day and they have not disappointed yet. Only complaint is that the water tastes like it is straight from the bathroom so buy a bottled one if you plan on drinking water. Vote for Jimmy!

It is hard to differentiate CrossFit gyms, but CrossFit Preferred has managed to do so with their cozy and convenient location, awesome and custom workout layout, and personable trainers/owner. My legs have not been this sore in my life despite playing college basketball! This is the spot.

Unbelievably amazing vegetarian sandwich. Wheat - pesto - mozzarella - tomato - mayo - avocado. Baked to a crisp perfection, it melted into my soul via my mouth. Will be back.

Where to begin... This place put me in the deepest food coma my consciousness has ever been (that is a good thing). I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with avocado (rehab size) with a side of sweet potato tots and French fries. While this is a pretty standard order in the food industry, there was something indescribably different about this place. Maybe it was the seasoning, maybe the vibes or music; regardless my experience here was great and I will be returning in the near future.

While all three of the Chop Shop locations are incredible, this may be my favorite one. This location has a very homey feel with a front and side yard as well as great people watching potential right on University. In addition, the parking is much more suitable at this location. Not only will I be coming back, but I will probably come back about every day.

This place is awesome. If you are looking to get a great cardio workout mixed with a bunch of strength exercises, this is the place to go. I am now a firm believer in Primal workouts. I am only 2 years removed from playing college basketball so I have done my share of different types of workouts, and this is now my favorite type. Amenzone keeps you engaged and energetic the entire time. The classes are small so it is almost like having a personal trainer, plus you are motivated by the people working out with you. Highly recommended.

iFix is a great under the radar phone and tablet repair shop in Oldtown, Scottsdale. She provided great service and really put the customer first, not trying to make an extra buck. If my current phone (which is now surrounded by a plastic brick of protection) or iPad ever break again, this would be the place I go!

Foosia is the future of Asian eating! Chipotle style line with many different options on what to throw in the bowl. All 7 of their sauces sounded amazing but I ended up choosing the two nuts sauce (haaaa) and in hindsight was a glorious decision. Add in the fact that there is a check in offer (free soft drink) I will definitely be taking my food tasting talents back to Foosia in the near future.

Sam Fox doesn't do much wrong. As always, modern architecture, friendly staff, great drinks, and live vibes. I come here about once a week and get the zinburger and sweet potato fries. One of my favorite combos at any restaurant. Only complaint is the occasionally slow service, but that is probably in part to the fact I drink water like a camel. 5 stars.

Thank God for Yelp! Was able to come across this gem while driving through this particular hood. Fresh Millions is a unique concept - the froyo of healthy food selections. Choose a base, sauce, meat, and four additional mix in's. The amount of food you get in one bowl will most likely leave you with leftovers as well. There is also an amazing promotional deal ($8 for $20) so take advantage of the greatness while you can. Will be back, despite the drive from over in Ahwatukee Foothills.

I'll keep this review short and simple - I came here to eat breakfast today. They don't make breakfast food during the week?! Only the weekends. I have never heard of a place doing this. Left here empty handed. Giving them two stars for the nice set up and inviting atmosphere.

The Soda Shop is awesome!! Amazing array of drinks and addicting sweet treats. My fav drink is the Big Booty Judy but the popular drink definitely seems to be the Shark Attack. Will be back every day I can make it! Also helps that the owners are laid back and have seemed to have trained the staff very well. 5 stars.

Best Thai food in Gilbert! I've had the Thai fever lately, and this place is by far my number one. I usually go with the Spicy Basil and it is incredible. Will be back here frequently to experiment and try new things. Also love the two story layout - modern, colorful, and friendly. 5 stizzars!!
