I love Sky Harbor.  The staff is friendly.  It's VERY Clean, plenty of dining/shopping options inside and out of security.  Security is INCREDIBLY fast considering sometimes the flow of traffic can be rather substantial.  There's always employees around to assist and they do so with a smile. An airport cannot be any better than this.  You can only pray to be as good.

Dr. marks stuff is exceptional.  Wonderfully polite and Dr. Marks is a wonderful Doctor.  He'll give you all the attention you need and the wait times aren't ridiculous either.

Josh is an exceptionally knowledgeable pool guy.  He's probably forgotten more about pools than most pool guys will ever know.  He can fix anything and he'll do a FANTASTIC job.  The thing is he's stretched way to thin and is very flaky on being there.  Don't even write down what time he says he'll be at your place because it's not whether or not he'll be on time or not, just assume he won't be.  The real question will be if shows up at all or not.  Don't bother calling or texting ahead of time because he won't answer. When he showed up though he was awesome.  He does great work.  I still have a job unfinished at my house now.  He was supposed to be at my house a week ago to finish paint and just never showed.  He stopped returning my calls and I can just assume from here on out he won't be returning.   I wanted to hire him on for regular weekly service but there's absolutely no way I can trust him enough to show up when he says he will which for me after a month or so of dealing with him flaking out on me. TL;DR - Great work. Possibly the worst logistics I've ever seen in any business ever.

When I hired Arizona Pool Pros, Josh did work on my popup Polaris system.  He incorrectly assembled the system he charged me several hundred dollars for which caused the gear assembly to go out again a few months later costing me another 225 dollars.  Very disappointed in someone who has all certifications to make such a simple mistake costing me even more money. Considering the one thing I had him repair, he did wrong. I wouldn't recommend him to anyone.

Very reasonably priced and the food is fantastic!  I took some pizza home and a week later it was still amazing!  The service is all smiles! Truly is a gem! Go there, eat there, love it there!
