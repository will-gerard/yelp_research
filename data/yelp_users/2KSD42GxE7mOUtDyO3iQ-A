Had Dr. Hartzfeld and she was GREAT! I LOVED her! Always left happy after my appointments with her! She delivered my baby boy and it went smooth and fast! I would definitely see her again when I am pregnant with my second baby!

It was my first time in this salon, went in for a gel pedicure and they got me in right away. My experience was great. My nail technician was Helen, I liked her, she did a good job. She took her time making sure my pedicure looked good. She was friendly and socialized with me. I would definitely return. My toes look great and feel so refreshed! Thank you!

I normally have no issues with El Super but today is different. They usually have sales on their produce and we brought peppers for 59 cents a pound. As we were checking out the cashier charge us 93 cents a pound and my dad told her the sign says 59 cents so she asked her manager and she said it was for 93 cents as well so as we were leaving I grabbed the sign to show the cashier and her Manger the sign with the price of 59 cents that my dad was right and all the manager said was you can't take off the sign. I told her I just wanted her to see she is wrong and should not be advertising that price. We didn't care for the few extra cents charge just didn't like they way the situation went down when they should know their sale prices and not argue with the customer when obviously it's the price that was set. Definitely not returning and is unhappy with the service when nothing was taken care of. Bad business and bad customer service.

Been wanting to try this place for awhile now but haven't had the chance and conveniently enough it's down the street from my house so it wasn't much of a drive. It was my first time and I ordered to go. The staff was friendly and the environment was good, only the parking lot is a small and tight but their food is worth it! Got two different kinds of ribs and cream corn soup and it was amazing! Definitely returning for ribs! Too bad they don't  deliver. It a hassle for me to take my 18 month old with me. If you haven't tried them already you should!!

Found this place on yelp and saw good reviews so decided to give it a try. I called in for delivery and ordered 3 tacos, a side of chips & salsa and a mango. The delivery was fast and the food was delicious! I absolutely loved the tacos and the salsa. Will definitely  be eating at this place again!

Just moved into the neighborhood and looking for a good pizza place, read good reviews on Yelp so wanted to try Sano's for the first time today but unfortunately I can't because I've been trying to call for delivery but cannot get through to anyone. Been calling constantly, it rings but no answer! It's a bummer I can't get a hold of them!!

Find this place on Yelp and saw they got good reviews so decided to give them a try (was planning on going to Sushi Station). Don't know what all the fuse was about but they were not good. Space was too small and not alot of options. When ordering sushi they forgot one of my orders and the waitress kept asking me if i ordered it. I said yes...finally it came out. First time and will be the last time. Was not good. Next time sticking with my regular spot at Sushi Station.

Had my first baby boy here 3 months ago and I absolutely LOVED it!! My RN, Stephanie was great! She helped me through the pain of labor without the epidural and I honestly don't know how I would've gotten through that without her help!! My first experience was a great one!

Was looking for a good nail salon in the area and thought I would try it out. I got a pedicure and a gel manicure, requested same time, told it was possible and expected to be taken care of right away but was not. Had to wait a few mintues for my pedicure and waited about half way through my pedicure for my gel manicure same time, reason why I only gave them 4 stars other then the wait I had a good experince. The technicals took good care of me and I am happy with my nails. Will definitely be a returning customer.
