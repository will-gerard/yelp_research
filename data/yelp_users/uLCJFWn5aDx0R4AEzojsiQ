When I got the directions to this place I was certain I had been led astray because I was going into a residential part of the city. Low and behold the diner was there, random in the middle of this Phoenix neighborhood. There are a few seats inside but the real experience is to sit out front. Do not expect to sit down at a normal booth and keep to yourself. The seating is basically lawn furniture and a few picnic tables giving the whole experience a backyard barbeque feel. As far as atmosphere "hipster" would be the greatest understatement of the year. I could have ridden a bicycle made of mustaches wearing the first black rimmed glasses ever made and I would not have been hip enough among the patrons. The menu is small but efficient and the food we received tasted great. I recommend the fried chicken sandwich with bacon and a hurricane to drink.

We decided to head out of town for a short trip to get some food. I remember hearing how good the pie was so I thought why not. Upon arriving we were seated after only a brief wait since it was not too busy. Our initial waitress was nice and seemed great. Then the wheels came off the wagon. When a new waitress was tagged in drinks went dry and orders were botched. The kitchen ran out of glasses and my soda was brought out in a dirty styrofoam cup. My friends order was not even close to what he asked for and my nachos were like soaking wet cardboard. On top of it all when there was an error on the bill the waitress rolled her eyes and fought us on it. Let's just say I didn't stick around for pie.

This place looks horrible from the outside however once the food is in your mouth you forget all about the appearance. The breakfast burritos are heavy as newborn infants and are the perfect end to a night of heavy drinking.

I am standing outside of the office right now for my daughter's vaccination appointment at 10:30am and the doors are locked with no answer at their office phone. My wife and I took the day off for this appointment and are loosing money because of this doctor's complete lack of respect. This is not the first time we have been kept waiting either. Ironically the appointment card they gave us says "if unable to keep appointment please give 24 hours notice." I guess that is only a one way street.

My guilty pleasure go-to place for junk food when I am having a shit week or after a big test. Sure it is a chain but that means consistency. Don't expect Wolfgang Puck flair when you just need a quick and easy bite. The location is super-convenient for students and for those who work on Mill.

In a sea of comic book stores that are going out of business Ash Avenue Comics has weathered the storm. This shop is so much like the ones I used to love as a kid. Comics and merchandise stretch from floor to ceiling. Unlike the stores I used to visit as a kid though the store is well lit, doesn't smell like BO and the staff is both knowledgeable and friendly.

Rula Bula is a "must visit" for the Mill Avenue visitor. It is a great place to just sit with friends, have a drink and talk. That is after all what an Irish pub is supposed to be. There is an excellent back patio with a satellite bar and misters. The food is typical Irish fare with everything from boxty to shepherds pie. Try the Hot Bollocks Spicy Potato Balls and wash it down with one of the hard ciders they have on tap.

If you are looking for a great start to a bachelor party or guys night out in Vegas then you have to try Hofbrauhaus. Huge steins of beer, a German girl dishing out shots and then punishing your friends with a wooden paddle, fun music, contests and an overall great atmosphere. Even if you aren't a polka fan (like me) you will find yourself clanking your beer glasses together and singing along with the other patrons. The food isn't the most amazing you've ever had but it is good and they give you big portions.

There is a scene in the movie The Crow where a cop and a young girl are sitting late at night eating at a hot dog stand. For years I wished that something like that existed where I lived or worked.  Thirsty Dog 2 Go is my weekly late night lunch spot. I work the night shift so finding cheap and quick food at night is a tall order. Thirsty Dog has a big selection of drinks (although sadly our local laws do not allow the alcoholic ones to be consumed within) and of course a variety of tube shaped meats to put in your mouth. Slide up to the little lunch counter, order up your meal and enjoy a conversation with any one of the really nice guys who work there. There is also a decent TV to watch sports or Sons of Anarchy. It is hard to categorize this place really. It is basically a convenience store because it has candy, beer, snacks and little gifts but it has the lunch counter so it is kind of a cafe too. Either way if you are in the Mill Ave area and want a good dog give them a try. You will probably see me there.

When my friends suggested the Aria for a bachelor party weekend headquarters I was skeptical. I assumed the price and the ambiance would not be conducive to a wild Vegas weekend. Boy was I wrong. The suite was very affordable when divided among the people staying (which may have been over the recommended capacity) and well appointed much like a furnished flat. The view from the wraparound floor-to-ceiling windows was fantastic and the blackout curtains kept the eye melting post inebriation sunlight at bay. The wet bar area with refrigerator was a great touch and was well used from the time we arrived until the time we departed. Our hosts even provided our group with a bar kit for mixing.  The pool area was what you would expect from a Vegas resort of this caliber: beautiful people and fruity drinks. There are multiple pools which always seem to be busy and restaurants adjacent so you don't have to get out of your bikini to have a snack. In the lobby I suggest getting a drink at the View Bar. As the name implies it is a great place to people watch, hang out and actually be able to have a conversation. My friends love the evening bartender Manny who mixes drinks using fresh fruits and ingredients.

The norm with "powersports" dealers is usually ignore everyone who doesn't look like they will be spending a ton of money. Not so with RideNow. I was shopping for a Scorpion helmet and after getting some help and a price I walked across the street to the competitor to compare. Not only was the unnamed neighboring shop higher priced but they had the older models. None of that mattered though because they didn't even acknowledge I entered the store. We immediately went back to RideNow and bought the helmet along with a bunch of other things. Recently I returned to buy new gloves. I was spending less than $50 and the guy on the floor treated me like I was buying a brand new bike. Well done, excellent customer service. Keep up the good work.

Friendly service, close to ASU campus and good selection of used games. I recently went for the Call of Duty Black Ops 2 midnight release and they did a pretty good job keeping the mob in check.

Traditional American comfort food done right! After my second visit Beckett's Table is quickly becoming one of my favorite Phoenix places to dine. The restaurant has a high-end feel to it but the prices are very reasonable. At first glance one might not think the menu is very adventurous but you would be missing the point. What Beckett's Table does is something we should all do which is: do your very best version of whatever it is you are doing. In this case it means not shocking everyone with exotic ingredients or wild ideas. Having amazing mashed potatoes and stuffing is almost always better than some alchemist chef experimenting on you. There is a reason we all love simple comfort food like popcorn and macaroni and cheese. The reason is that we know it will be good. If someone said "hey have you tried my new chili pepper and sardine flavor mac?", you might be curious but it is hardly anything you sit around hungry for. There is a quaint theme to many of the menu items which is the inclusion of bacon on nearly everything. Worry not though vegetarians Beckett's will not leave you hungry. My veggie wife was able to get the grilled cheese and tomato soup bacon-free with no fuss. The staff is very friendly and the ability to place a reservation through the Yelp ap in between Call of Duty matches was a big help.

Writing a review about a taco shop seems a bit stupid at first. I mean tacos are tacos right? Honestly no they aren't. There is a huge difference between tacos (or any dish really) you eat while drunk and those eaten while sober. The magic that makes a 2:30am meal taste amazing is mysteriously absent when you return with your wits about you. Herein lies the difference with Fuzzy's. I will not go into incredible detail but suffice to say that they have cured several of my usual taco pet peeves. The first thing they have done right is to put the grated cheese on the bottom so that it can melt into the meat and not just fall off. Many of the menu choices can also be had with feta cheese on top. Secondly they have gone away from the trap of "super spicy for no reason". Trust me that is a good sign. Ask the Creoles and they will tell you the relationship between camouflaging spicy and terrible tasting ingredients to make something edible. Instead they have chosen to used a garlic sauce that brings out the flavor of the meat rather than masking it. The final thing is that the shop owners have kept the prices very reasonable. If you go I recommend the huge iced chalice of beer.

For years this building has been a place for burnouts and drug addicts to congregate around. Many of you may know it as the old art store that had the big xylophone in front. When I saw that someone was finally developing this space I was excited, well that is until I ate there. The Good: Well lit and clean place with very cheap eats and large portions The Bad: The chicken is... not... good. With a name like Bad Mother Cluckers I HAD to try it. When I went to eat there with co-workers I ordered the sliders that were on special. Fearing that they would be insufficient for my ravenous hunger I ordered 2. As it turns out the slider special is a huge amount of food. For 2 orders of the slider special, fries and a can of soda I was in less than $6. The problem was that the chicken sliders were just as my rating implies "meh". Sadly KFC is 100% better. I normally don't complain about this but the amount of time it took to order, prepare and finally get our meal was long to say the least. Our lunch break was over by the time we all got our food. The place was nearly empty and there are only a handful of items on the menu so there really was no excuse. On a completely unrelated note while we were eating 2 very attractive Asian women walked in and started eating on the other side of the room. My co-worker pulled the "hey I dropped my fork" move so he had a reason to say hi to them. They were so far away though that he literally had to throw his fork. This was literally the best part about eating there. "A" for effort on his part.

Excellent service, experience, and price for my 16 person corporate event! The owner was very accommodating and answered all of our questions. Everyone had a great time and I will return with my company groups in the future. Super close to Rula Bula for cocktails and diner after your escape.
