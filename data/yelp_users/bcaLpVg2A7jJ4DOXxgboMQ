I just returned from Sylvia's La Canasta and will NOT be returning.  I have been going to Sylvia's for at least a decade now and have seen the decline of the resturant mostly due to the lack of good servers.  The food is good but I can always get the same thing down the street at Las Compadres with better service.  When I have ordered on the phone been told that it would be 10 minutes and get there about 20 mintues later the food is not ready and they have to put in another order.  I always ask what's the point of calling in if I have to order when I get here again, always no answer.    Today I walked in didn't bother calling, because well what's the point.  Ordered a #10 got home to start working again and started opening my food, they forgot the rice and beans.  That might not seem like a deal breaker but with all the other crap I have chosen not to go back.

My nieghbor and I purchased the alley behind our houses.   We needed someone to come out and remove the gravel and level the area for irrigation and so that we can also fence that area in.  We had several different companies come out and give us estimates.  Ryan was the most reasonable estimate.   He was honest and came on the days and times that he said he would be here.  I have recomended Ryan before and will do it again.

Love Saffron Market, the Turkish coffee that they keep stocked is just amazing.  The pastries are just delicious always makes for a great little snack on my way back to central Phoenix.  The variety of products are really great and I always pick up something new I haven't tried just to try it.  Plus the store owner is very pleasant to deal with.  The store is always clean and the smells of all the spices are just amazing.
