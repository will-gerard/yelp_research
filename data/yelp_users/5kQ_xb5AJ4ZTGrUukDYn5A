My Honey loves his cigars.  This place had a nice selection and good deals.  There wasn't much space to relax and smoke but I hear they are opening a lounge next door.    The boys all came away with a bag of cigars so I'm pretty sure needs were filled. The humidifier blasting in the corner felt good while I was waiting.  What can I say, a girl in Arizona needs as much moisture as those cigars!

My friend was looking for a specific wedding dress and this store had the dress.  We called but they didn't answer the phone so we just stopped in.  Usually bridal boutiques are by appointment only.  That was the case here but the ladies were still welcoming and let my friend look around.  She found the dress she wanted and they took time to call the manufacturer to get a sample dress in her size.  She'll go back another day when she has an appointment to try it on.  For a short visit without an appointment, the ladies here treated us very nicely.  None of that snooty bridal treatment here.  The mother of one of the brides who had an appointment, however, scary!  Momzilla!

It's Starbucks...in Vegas.  Yay!  Just the fix I needed.  I tried some other Vegas coffee and it made me very very sad. Then we were leaving the Shark Reef exhibit and Ahhh (cue heavenly celestial rays of light) there it was, the promised land.  So happy to have my Caramel Macchiato on vacay! Yay!  My son was giving me major grief and singing silly songs about my addiction but yeah still worth it.

Really very good for airport food.  The choices were unique and a bit new age.  I had a breakfast burrito with tofu in it.  It was really very good.  The cashier who helped me was fun and seriously perky.  I was scanning the wall menu and then looked around for a cashier in a dazed 'lost airport soul' manner.  He grabbed my attention with eye contact and handed me a menu then led me to the right counter.  Great customer service!  It was also a nice place to sit and wait for my flight.

This is basically a counter style food place.  Everything is fairly fresh but all pre-packaged. The coffee selections are oddly named but the coffee is decent.  My son did not like the tuna salad at all but scarfed down an apple cinnamon muffin easily enough. My Cobb salad was chintzy with the good stuff and used iceberg lettuce, ack.   It filled the need but barely.

Best Starbucks ever!  My friends drive halfway across Gilbert every day, past two or three other Starbucks to come here.  The baristas treat them like royalty or family, whichever you think is better treatment. :-)  My girlfriend loves to have her coffee EXACTLY like she likes it.  They hook her up.  They make her coffee and then put a bucket of ice and the caramel next to her cup so she can make it special.  During winter, they give her the whipped cream and sprinkles.  She starts her coffee here so she can whip and sprinkle a second time, brilliant!  Every barista knows them and greets them with a happy hello.  Bonus, it's in the Safeway so we go shopping afterwards.  Double win!

Oh the smells!  Oh the cinnamon!  Oh the baked goods!  What a stellar little bakery.  The owner is so nice and the cashiers are very social and helpful.  They have many yummy things to try.  I get Challah bread for French Toast here.  The cookies are divine.  You've got to try the snicker doodles.  Heaven!  They are cinnamony and soft on the inside with a slight crispiness on the outside.  Oh, if only I had bought enough to take on the plane!  My friends bought muffins and really good bread.  Also, cinnamon rolls and orange rolls. The orange rolls are basically cinnamon rolls with an orange glaze.  Wow!  You've got to give them a try if you are in Gilbert.  Super yummy!

The food here is soooo good!  The pancakes are massive, bigger than the plate!  I had a scramble one day and the Cali Eggs Benedict on another day.  So good!  Their biscuits and gravy are divine! You've got to try the chorizo gravy, what flavor!  It's not spicy just sinfully good. Mmm, I want some again right now!
