My puppy tested negative for parvo but was having diarrhea. After spending HOURS researching and reading forums I had a strong feeling that there was some sort of intestinal parasite which is "very common amongst puppies" according to almost every article I read. When they tested my puppies stool they said it came back clean. I thought to myself that that was impossible and that there is definitely something wrong because he was getting the runs and not eating. Dr. Anderson's response was simply "Well you better feed it or else it's not going to last long"  ... uh ...no duh that is why I am trying to figure out what the heck is wrong! When I asked if he could give me a dewormer (as most puppies are dewormed as a preventative measure he said he wasn't going to do that. I left feeling so frustrated and like I had literally paid them $62 FOR NOTHING. Not even one once of good advice.   I took him to another vet that day in which they were able to immediately look at his stool and determine that he had coccidia (an intestinal parasite). They prescibed him a dewormer, Alabon, and now he is on his way to a full recovery!   I would not recommend this place to anyone. The older vet seems like he just has been in the game too long and doesn't care at all. Our pets are our lives and when someone doesn't show compassion or at least offer a viable solution it is very disheartening. Donnie was the only one who really acted like she cared and did what she could to help.

Today I had a really great experience at Gilbert Veterinary Hospital. I have taken my little 6 week old puppy who has had constant diarrhea for 3 days to THREE different vets with no diagnosis. I felt absolutely helpless and haven't slept in 4 days because I was so worried about this pup. I could instantly tell on the phone that they cared and they were able to get me in the same day which was awesome because with one lb puppies you never know what timeline you are working with.   I was convinced he had an intestinal parasite after doing days of research but none of the vets would listen or prescribe him a dewormer.   Gilbert Animal Hospital looked at his stool on site (none of that 24-48 lab test crap) and definitely saw coccidia, an intestinal parasite. They did send stool to a lab for further tests but they were able to prescribe him a dewormer and we are on the road to recovery. Yay! So blessed I was lead here and would recommend them to anyone. The staff CARES.

The manager at this location was very rude and made a big scene when I brought in my 8 week old (hypoallergenic) maltese. I literally just walked in to pick up a muffin, leave and be on my merry way. I didn't come in more than 15 ft in the store as the coffee/pastries bar is RIGHT at the entrance. When I told her that she kept on making a big deal about it. I work just down the road and see people bring their dogs around ALL the time. North Scottsdale is so uppity sometimes it drives my crazy.

I have lived here for over a year and haven't eaten at the Herb Box until last night. Didn't realize what I've been missing out on! This place was amazing! Ashton our server was awesome and gave us excellent recommendations (ahem Thai Ribs...) Not only was the service great the whole ambiance topped it off. The Art Festival and Live Music. Love it.

Good food and I like the atmosphere.  My waitress sucked tho.  I think she forgot about us.  I've been twice and the first time was great but the service the second time was bad.

Misty has great Vintage taste! Everything in their was classy and clean. Perfect boutique to open in Old Town. The items are pricey but are one of a kind.

The place is cute and the employees are nice but the food is sooooo bland. Tastes like something you would heat up in a microwave. Plus the advertise to be a "modern cuisine" but they play ragtime music from the 1920's. C'mon...if I can't enjoy the food at least play some half decent music.

The owner is literally SO rude. The kind of rude where you are like "Is this even real?" He's definitely got some chip his shoulder. I was hesitant to even leave a review cause I like to support small businesses but when I logged in I saw that I definitely wasn't the only one who's been treated like this I decided to add mine the bunch! Idk how they are still in business. Pretty crazy how people can get away with treating PAYING customers like shit.

I have had my lashes a lot but Let's Lash is BY FAR the best service I have ever had. They looked absolutely amazing and natural.  You are definitely making a mistake if you go anywhere else! Not only are the girls there talented the whole environment and atmosphere is just a fun and relaxing experience as a whole. Very high quality service!!

Zoey is the most in tune and talented person I know! Her guidance finally helped me get over something I was dealing with for months. I felt a MILLION times lighter when I left my session and that energy continued with me as the week went on. Sometimes it just takes a little lifting and then you are back on your feet:) I am grateful everyday for the experience I had with her and her impeccable expertise.

By far the best sandwiches in the DC Ranch Area by far! Staff was super cool, friendly, and helpful! A lot of places in North Scottsdale have snotty workers but they were super chill here! Definitely will go back and I highly recommend this place!
