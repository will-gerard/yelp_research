Great place to order takeout. We have only eaten inside once and I'd rather just take it home. I guess the dine in experience gives this place it's 3 star rating. Other than that, I don't get it. They have great food!

Called yesterday to have our sectional cleaned and they showed up today to get the job done. They were efficient, friendly, and just did a great job!  The whole process from the first call to paying for the service was as easy as it could be.

I've been going to Dr. Reuss for nine years and have nothing but great things to say.  He has a very thorough approach and I've never felt rushed. His staff is the best!

First time eating here last night. Food was just "ok" and our service was soooo terrible. We waited over an hour to get our food. They were also out of sour cream. How can you be out of sour cream at a Mexican restaurant?! We were also asked if we saved room for dessert--we hadn't even gotten our dinner yet. Big bummer because we were looking forward to eating here after reading other reviews.

There are soooo many great things to say about Kevin.  Finding a great realtor can be tough--only a small percentage of the total population is good at what they do.  Kevin is one of those few.  He is truly a diamond in the rough.  He recently sold my in-laws' condo and we were all so impressed with the entire process working with him.  He manages to balance his personality & friendliness with professionalism and an element of realism.  I HIGHLY recommend using Kevin as your realtor. You will NOT be disappointed.  He is different from the rest!!!!
