What a great park! My kids love the railroad train ride. I had a great time relaxing, while my daughters played on the monkey bars. It wasn't crowded, which is wonderful, but I imagine it's depends on the day. The little general store is really darling and reminds me of the novelty shops back when I was younger. The icecream wasn't the best, but the kids enjoyed it. There is even an area you can learn about the history of the park. Surprisingly, it has been in Scottsdale for a long time. I would recommend it for birthday parties and weekend BBqs. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the wait of the railroad train ride, otherwise it is a nice, family spot.

Butterfields never disappoints. This is by far the best breakfast in Scottsdale. I usually get the veggie omelette. I don't know how they get their omelettes so fluffy. It's melt in your mouth goodness. The food always comes out in time and is warm. My favorite dish is the wild berry waffle. This is definitely one for sharing. I've gone other places where they serve cold eggs. The servers are very courteous, the restaurant is clean and beautiful. The only downside is that you will be waiting long if you come in on a Saturday morning. However, that's a sign of a great establishment.

I've been coming to this particular Starbucks for years. It's in Kierland which is convenient. Mostly, I find it a place for people watching. It's always crowded and the lines are long. The customer service isn't great, not friendly at all. Drinks are usually correct, but I have even had iced coffee with milk get screwed up. Really...coffee, milk then ice. It's not that difficult. The reason I'm writing a review right now is because of a particularly strange experience last night. My boyfriend and I came in for an Americano. The strange, socially awkward barista completely left us at the register, with no one in line, her back turned to us while she busied herself pouring coffee from pitcher to pitcher. She said to wait. We were waiting 5 min! I think whatever she was doing could've waited until she took are 2 orders. Someone else finally came to take or order. It was completely rude and annoying. Starbucks should really chose their employees a little better. People skills are important. Customers should come first.

I really love Grimaldi's pizza. The cheese is delicious, the crust is perfect, and it has the perfect cheese to sauce ratio; however the service is so bad here. For the most part the servers are apologetic, but others are just plain rude. There are always screaming infants at this restaurant and huge parties.  You will be forgotten if you are not in a party of six.  We had Kendell as our waitress. I've never had a waitress argue with me regarding how long the food was taking. I timed when we were sat to when the pizza arrived..40 min Kendell! Kendell made sure to correct me at 30 min. Uh, you might want to save your tip and not correct your customers. Anyway, I may only come here during the weekdays and never on weekends.

I would definitely recommend this clinic to anyone looking to improve their appearance. The staff is knowledgeable, professional and above all personable. They go above and beyond to give each of their patients the star treatment. I completed the Zerona treatment in December and I could not believe my results.  I have one word...MAGIC!  I am not a skinny lady and have struggled with losing extra fat around my abdomen and buttocks for years.  It is discouraging working out and not seeing results in these stubborn areas. The Zerona changed that for me. After my Zerona treatments, I lost 2 dress sizes! Almost 3 months later, my results have stayed the same.  I am beyond thrilled.  I did 12 treatments which is what the manager recommended, and she was absolutely right.  The treatment was painless and easy, unlike other body contouring procedures on the market.  A physician assistant performs the treatment and educated me on the whole process. All I had to do was increase my water intake during the process and maintain my usual walking routine.  I felt like I was really given the best care here. My best friend also did the Zerona treatment, and also got great results just in time for her daughter's wedding. I have also had my injectables done here with the PA, and I have gotten so many compliments on how good I look.   I am actually enjoying shopping for clothes again.  Thank you American Laser Skincare.

This is the best neighborhood pizza place. I consider myself a pizza snob and generally only get gourmet pizzas, but this place rivals any fancy pizza restaurant. It was a couple different pizza places in the past, but I hope they don't ever move out of this space. Oh, and they have the friendliest staff and address you by name. Truly feels personalized.
