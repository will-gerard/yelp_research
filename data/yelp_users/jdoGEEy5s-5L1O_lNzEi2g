Uber yumz fa sho.  Japanese-style Western food!  Last time my gf and I were here, we got the tofu steak and takoyaki (octopus balls) for starters.  The takoyaki came in a set of six and was topped with this oh-so-delicious brown sauce.  We followed that up with a wakame (seaweed) salad and an entree of salmon in cream sauce over pasta (not the exact name. it's on the last page of the menu near the bottom).  OH MAN! SUPER DELICIOUS!  Finished it off with a creme brulee, which surprisingly wasn't too rich.  Oh man, my mouth is watering just thinking of it and it doesn't seem to matter that it's nearly 6am in the morning as I write this.  That alone should be a testament as to how rad the food at Cherry Blossom is.

After getting diarrhea from eating the mediocre Mongolian Beef here, I think I would avoid any future contact with this establishment.

I personally think that their serving sizes for pho are larger than most other places.  What may be a regular bowl at Saigon can be a large bowl at other Vietnamese places in the area. Plus, I'm a big fan of broth and it's pretty decent here.  All this for not a lot of cash.  It's just about the best bowl of pho you'll get in Chandler.  *Update* Dropped it down a star because the last few times I've been there, the pho has been a bit sub-par (noodles were weird and they were stingy on the beef).  You really should only eat here if you live in Chandler and don't wanna drive up to the better places in Mesa, Tempe, or Phoenix.  *Update 2.0* They've really gone downhill, based on the last two times I've gone.  I wouldn't even bother ordering pho here anymore.  The rice dishes may be it's only saving grace.

Gluttony at it's finest.  There is nothing more satisfying than a meal of chicken and waffles.  The chicken was moist and flavorful and the waffles had a slight hint of cinnamon flavor.  To top it off, they serve kool-aid in mason jars and the sweet tea is mostly sugar, but still majorly awesome.

As mentioned earlier, the best thing about this place is the super cheap, but super delicious lunch bentos.  You get a main dish, rice, salad, and an orange for under $4. If that's not enough, you can get double meat for a buck or two more.  I highly recommend the ginger pork or the katsu.  My friend I normally go with is a big fan of the white fish (fried or grilled).  The sushi here isn't bad.  It's nothing super special, but I don't come here for the sushi so it's not a big knock against the place.  As they would say on ebay: A+++ Great Seller! Would eat here again!!!

Some of the most bomb pho this state has to offer.  I can vouch for the Pho Tai, the Bun/noodle salad dishes, and the wonton noodle soup dealio.  Plus, the old dude who works there is a pretty friendly guy unlike most Asian-hole-in-the-wall establishments that put customer service dead last.  Thus, the food is good, the prices are fair, and the workers are friendly.  Why not eat here?

A friend and I went here a couple weeks ago on a random Wednesday night to get a quick bite to eat.  Having not had Chinese food in a while (in a state that lacks any real great Chinese food), we decided to give Wong's Place a shot.  We ordered the twice-cooked pork and the beef chow fun in black bean sauce.  Neither of the dishes were really that great.  The twice-cooked pork was far too sweet and overloaded with vegetables as filler and the beef chow fun was greasier than I'd prefer.  And to seal the deal, a classmate of mine whom I saw working there, later informed me to avoid eating here because they allegedly "recycle" the rice there.  You got it, the last table's leftover white rice is now being added into your pot and served to you.  If you're looking for legit Chinese food, you're better off going somewhere else.  Edit: Based on recent reviews, perhaps the 1-2 star reviews aren't getting their point across.  Here's a list of places you're better off going to:  1. Asian Hong Kong/Hong Kong Asian Diner (the name escapes me, but it's on the NW corner of Rural and Ray) 2. Panda Express 3. Subway 4. Filibertos  As you can see, while there are more legitimate (and delcious) Chinese restaurants to eat at, it seems that just about ANYWHERE is a better choice than Wong's.  Please, just let them go the way of Chrysler and eat somewhere else.

I don't care if this place is known as the "McDonalds" of the Vietnamese sandwich world.  So long as they can serve me an awesome sandwich under $3, then they're okay in my book.  So quit crying about "ow the hard bread cuts the roof of my mouth."  If you want a wuss sandwich, then go down the street to Subway.

The only thing you need to know about this place is that it's the best dim sum you can get in Phoenix.  Do yourself a favor and go try it.

Best thing to happen to Phoenix in a long time.  One of the few places I know that serve Japanese food that doesn't just consist of Sushi or teriyaki chicken bowls.  You must eat:  Katsu curry Ramen Gyu don Niku Soba Tenzaru Soba  I wish they still had hamachi kama :(  If you haven't eaten here and say you enjoy Japanese food, then I would begin to question whether you even like it at all to begin with (or you just tell your friends you do just so you can come off as cultured and "with it").  And if you HAVE eaten here and aren't digging it *coughteriyakichickenwtfcough*, there's a splendid Neo Tokyo up the road that may be more suited to your "tastes" (or lack thereof).

HK style western foooood *heart*  Next closest place to get something like this is California *heartx2*  The menu is ginormous.  My only advice to you is to not order any of the Americanized nonsense in the front of the menu and skip to the latter half where all the good stuff is at.  I've had the Japanese bbq pork with egg over rice dish (I think that's what it's called) and, while I didn't have high expectations for it, it was surprisingly good.  The Wonton Noodle soup is probably one of the best dishes here.  Might be on the salty side for some, but that's how I like it.  The Singapore rice noodles (can't remember the english name so I'm improvising) were pretty good as well, in all it's curry-noodley goodness.  Overall, you can't really go wrong with this place.  It's good, cheap eats and that's all there really is to it.

Food overall was good (Tofu soup, grilled meat, etc.).  There wasn't really any dish I could knock.  Serving size for lunch dishes was still pretty large.  The wait staff was pretty helpful in helping me pick something good that I've never had before.  Hell, I even think the water they serve there is bottled, not tap!

Tuesday night happy hour till 2am is what keeps bringing me back. $2 wells, small sakes, and draft and bottled beer (including Corona and Blue Moon).  The happy hour menu is pretty substantial, consisting of various sushi rolls, nigiri, and appetizers such as tuna tataki and Hawaiian poke salad.  The Hamachi kama here is also pretty delicious and the large "Korean" menu always presents me with something new worth trying.  Hell, I think they're one of the very few places in Phoenix that serves okonomiyaki and ochazuke.  The staff are all very friendly and you can not only sit at the bar or a table, but some lounge chair area dealio near the entrance.  Pretty sweet.  Also, they have any major sports events on the big flatscreen lcds at the bar.  All in all, an uber sweet weekly hangout with great food and even better drink specials.  *edit* The addition of an inexpensive private karaoke room further enforces the five star rating

Quite possibly the best Loco Moco I've ever had.  It's hamburger patty, fried egg, and brown gravy heaven.  Gnarliest grinds I've had since I was in da 808, brah'.

This place = Failtown, USA.  My friends and I went in a while back to check out what all the hype was about this place.  Sure, it seemed like it was a Hooters knockoff (replace wings with burgers), but we had some hope that this establishment would be legit. WRONG.  The waitress informs one of my buddy's that if he finishes some sort of monster glutton burger then the meal was on the house.  Well sometime later, after putting that entire burger away, we get the check and notice the burger was still on the check.  We bring it up with the waitress who beats around the bush.  We then ask for the manager, who was VERY non-compliant.  After the discussion turns into an argument (wow real professional on your part Heart Attack Grill), he threatens to "call the cops if we don't leave and we better or else he's going to jump over the counter and punch us in the face."  SO MUCH FAIL  Regardless of whether the food was good or not (nothing spectacular), I am NEVER going back there again nor would I recommend anyone else to do so.  There's a Red Robin a mile west on Warner that has a full bar and burgers just as gluttonous with unlimited steak fries to boot.  If I could give this place 0 stars (along with AIDS, Herpes, Cancer, and a slow fiery death), I would.  DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE

As mainstream-americanized as this place comes off as, the Veggie platter and Gyro platter weren't bad.  I'll admit, I'm no real connoisseur of Mediterranean food, but Daphne's hit the spot and wasn't too harsh on the wallet.

So Arizona finally gets it's own yogurt place.  This once again proves my point that we're at least two years behind California.  Anyways, it's no Pinkberry or Red Mango, but this place is pretty legit.  Out of the two yogurt places I've tried in AZ, this would be the better of the two.  I normally get the mochi topping on the yogurt, but as of late the mochi has been tasting kinda funny.  The choice of fruit was a bit slim when I visited, but I guess it didn't help that I went near the end of the night.  Eitherway, it's not all that bad.  If you're into yogurt and live in the East Valley, this is the place to be.

Cliff notes - Cheap: $1-2/plate - Fast: It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor - Acceptable quality: I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lol  This place is definitely good for what it is, "it" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to "reduce costs" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.  On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time).   I've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).  For those claiming to be "left to fend for themselves" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called "the menu" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as "descriptions" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL DIAF  And the cherry on top? $4 large japanese beers and $5 sake bombs! HELL YEAH!

Only place I know in AZ that serves Kimchi Fried Rice and Ramyun with the noodle cake things.  That alone is enough reason to eat here. However, that doesn't mean any of their other dishes are lacking.  The GF and I some sort of clam/seafood clear broth soup and it was light, but still good.    Only thing I can think of avoiding is the lunch bowls.  A buddy of mine ordered the Chicken one and we weren't sure if the chicken was rubbery because it was super processed or not cooked all the way through.  **Update - 12/8/09 - Closed**

Aside from the usual Americanized-Chinese fare, this place shines in what it has to offer on it's "Chinese" menu.  The only place I know that has the ShanDong Chinese/Korean favorite, Ja jang myun.  If it adds to it's credibility at all, both my Chinese AND Korean friends talk highly of the ja jang myun here.  I've had it myself and I thought it was pretty good (although I hadn't really tried it any where else so it's really hard to gauge against anything else).  So if you're sick of the usual sichuan, cantonese, *insert chinese province here*, then give Chef Chiang's a shot.

This restaurant has replaced Saigon as my Vietnamese restaurant of choice in the Chandler area.  I've had the Pho Tai and Wonton noodle soup and both are legit.  Broth is the key thing I look for in a good pho and Pho Van's is solid.  They're relatively generous with the meat and all the veggies for the pho.  Even the interior of the restaurant is pretty nice for a Vietnamese restaurant.  It's a modern look with lcd tvs on the walls and a large aquarium in the middle of the dining area.  My only potential gripe is that for a bowl of pho, it's on the higher side when it comes to price.  Regardless, if it says anything about the establishment, I may as well consider myself a regular here now.

Had the Pho Tai there.  Service wasn't bad, but the food was overpriced and medicore.  You're better off going somewhere else nearby like Khai Hoan or Pho Thanh.

This place is legit.   It's probably one of the few noodles houses in the Phoenix-area, unlike the myriad in California (which I so dearly miss).  I'm glad to see that the varieties of food are diversifying more and more now.  Anyways, grabbed lunch here with my mom earlier.  I got the zha jiang mian/noodles with minced pork sauce and my mom ordered the beef with fried noodles in XO spicy sauce.  The prices were relatively reasonable and the portions were generous, as you'll see from the pictures uploaded.  We both stuffed ourselves pretty well and still had leftovers to take home.  The dishes themselves were quite delicious, unlike anything else in Phoenix (at least in the East Valley).  The zha jiang mian/noodles with minced pork sauce wasn't too salty or overwhelming.  Just lots of thin noodles with ground pork with bits of garlic in a light brown sauce.  The dish was garnished with some green onions and raw cucumbers.  Definitely a good lighter dish.   The beef with fried noodles in XO spicy sauce was also quite appetizing, but a little on the oily side.  The waitress suggested we try the dish with the "shave noodles", which are hand-cut noodles that are wide, flat, and do not have a consistent shape unlike ordinary noodles.  The dish itself has a slight kick to it with some dried red chili peppers in it and contained a good helping of veggies and beef.  It even had a slight shiitake mushroom flavor to it, but there were no mushrooms to be found.  Either way, it was delicious.  Overall, my experience at this restaurant was pleasurable and I'd recommend it to anyone else looking to try a more authentic, less represented style of Chinese food here in the Valley.  *As an addendum: Food tends to come out quickly here so that is another big plus for this place.

As a Chinese guy here in Arizona it's pretty hard to find any decent Chinese food.  I mean, if PF Chang's is your idea of authentic, you need to get your head checked then come to HK Asian Diner. This fine establishment is one of the few places that one can get a pretty authentic Chinese meal.  Just look at the usual crowd that frequents the restaurant and you know it's the real deal.  I can't really pick any specific dishes out that I particularly enjoy, but pretty much anything off the "Chinese" menu is pretty solid.    In conclusion, get out of your comfort zone and try something new.  The only thing that should scare you about this place is the HK gangster waitress. She may come off as rude, but that's just how they do it back in the home country so don't fret. Go there and you'll see what I mean haha.
