THE best tapas in the area! Definitely comparable to the real deal (I studied abroad in northern Spain so I always have a craving for tapas!) Order the croquetas and paella, to die for!

Where do I start? First of all they think they're in Las Vegas with there entrance process and when you walk in there's a matter of 5 people in there. Second of all, we had "friends" who had a table and had to mention their name when again there was one only table around. The club was completely empty it was so lame and we kept asking the bottle service girl for drinks, never came and finally I asked again and she said "the table guy said were not allowed to serve you guys".   Hahaha what a joke. We were out of there like the police were chasing us. Worst establishment in Scottsdale.
