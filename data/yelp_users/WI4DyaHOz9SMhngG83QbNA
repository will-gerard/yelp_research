Ate in tonight and the food was fine it was the service that was not good.  Our waiter was very Rico suave and had far better things to do with his night than bring us our food or even show up to our table at all, when he did make it around,  he reeked of Cologne and I just wanted him to scram.  There was a large group of odd looking hygienically challenged old Indian men running around,  I think they were the bus boys but they came by to clean a table next to us and liberally spayed Windex all over the place so that added a nice flavor to our food and he then decided the carpet on the front part of our table needed vacuuming right then and there so he broke out the vacuum and went to town for about five Min's, nice. we had to seek out the check and when we did get it we were over charged for alcohol we didn't even order, thanks Rico for the nice $71 evening for our little party of three, as good as the tikka masala is we wont be back.

I think this guy has let his 15 min of fame go to his head. Came here last week with a couple girlfriends for dinner,  The price we paid for just OK bland and flavorless food, cheep wine with a three times the price  price tag, and the luxury to sit on flimsy outdoor chairs, rolled in a napkin silverware and the best yet, plastic water cups was mind blowing. I felt like our waiter was up selling us the whole time and the hovering cocky owner was annoying at best. and lets talk about the " As seen on food network" sign hanging over the door and the diner guys pic hanging ever where, way overkill there. also what happened to a basket of free bread, come on $3 for bread are you kidding me. Whatever this place can suck it I wont be back.

We called in a order to go at work the other day.  Holly big bowl of rice,  we all got the med and were surprised to see a huge bowl of brown rice with a pretty skimpy portion of chicken and Teriyaki sauce and that's it,  I got the combo bowl so I got some veggies and chicken and the veggies were pretty sad. Don't think we will order again it seemed such a waste when we all threw away all that leftover rice after we had eaten our meager little portion of chicken.  I will say everyone said the chicken was quite good.

Hot bagels is a quick easy stop on my way to work.  I always get the breakfast sandwich double toasted and have never been disappointed.

Picked up dinner last night,  The hot and sour soup was good but cold when I got home 5 mins later, the potstickers were good but the japanesse ramen was just yuck,  I ordered it with vegies and they all tasted old and soggy and the noodles were sticky and way overcooked with just a bad flavor, thew most of it in the trash. Havent been here in ages and now I remember why It's just not good. For half the price I could have went to panda and got better.  Time to step it up.

We had a GC that was expiring that night so we ran in for a quick dinner. Both had beers, the beers were great , the moldy oranges on the rim were not. Megan was our waitress and she was great and even joked around a little with us and that was nice. I think we ordered way wrong on the food as the reviews on here are raving about the burgers, had the chicken Parmesan and wow what a hot mess that was, straight tomato paste out of the can over linguine noodles and some chicken tenders cut up and mixed throughout.  This dish should be taken off the menu or worked out. Had a dinner salad as well, nothing special here but the ranch was good. Dont think we would go back.

This was my second visit. and it went much like the first.  we both had the soul food platter with chicken. really good mac and cheese and it stayed pipping hot throughout the whole meal not sure how but it was nice. really good waffle I couldn't stop eating it, fried okra you can skip its just like little nuggets of fried zucchini but with nothing to dip them in. and dry as a bone cornbread even though it had a full scoop of butter on top when it arrived. The chicken was really good the only complaint there was the wings were dry, super good homemade lemon aide I drank two quart size jars full of it good. service was attentive and lots of different people that worked there came around to check on you so you were never in want of anything. Saw lots of people coming in to get takeout so thats a nice option, next time I will get extra chicken to go because its so good cold the next day.

I stop in here every now and then for a Pastrami on a smiley. As everyone says its the bread that makes it. You can buy the bread but I think you have to order in advance for larger orders. The pastrami I had today was saltier than usual but still pretty good. nice staff, clean place. you can buy Board head meats and cheeses by the pound as well.

Had a great lunch here today. Sat outside the weather was prefect for it, people watching was great. Jamie was our server she was both genuinely friendly and super attentive with out being pushy. Turkey burgers were a nice surprise to see and they were very tasty. The Arizona peach is nice light and refreshing while my husbands Ips was a bit bitter for me. glad I tried this place out and we will go back for sure.

Belch oh wait Belch excuse me pleaae . Just got back from this place and we are feeling quite bloated.  House Margarita well lets just say I am glad I had a cocktail before  my hubby drove us there, chips and salsa ummm OK I guess, we both had the taco enchilada combo, taco was Ok I liked the shell and the shredded beef was pretty good, enchilada not so good bland week sauce with literally a 1/2 cup of melted cheep cheese inside, just left it on my plate. guac was decent but nothing was worth coming back for.  The service was good.

Stellar bakery here full to the  gills with yummy wonder. Had a cream cheese danish for the road yummy. also some cookies by the pound, good but it adds up quickly and they are pricey at eight something a pound. The rye bread has been wrapped around some nice ham all week for lunch and its Divine and the French is just a s Delicious.

Stopped in today for some rye swirl, already had a ham sandwich with it and it was amazing!! picked up a few other goodies, this place could be dangerous and addictive. The cannoli is different and way sweet don't think I will get it again, needs citrus I think. So many good things to try.

Stopped in here yet again with my two year old granddaughter the other day, as soon as we pull up she starts barking out cookies cookies, she knows exactly where we are. we were having a little party that night, and were making pizzas so I was here to get the dough which is fabulous by the way, asked the lady behind the counter for a dessert recommendation she said try a coffee round, I took the mixed berry and it was superb not a bite left, cant wait to try the other flavors like apple, and pecan. Another great trip to the bakery. Miss Chloe was happy with her Christmas cookie and ate the sprinkles off all the way home.

This was the place that started our obsession with Indian food. We go when we are in Vegas and its always good but super expensive for Indian, not sure why so pricey it's at the Rio not Bellagio or the Wynn so that is our only complaint. Have eaten at the Gaylord's in San Fran and sausalito and they were good as well.

Everything has been said, we love this place. The food is consistently good with great flavors and a feeling of quality here. service is always top notch. we have been often and will be back for more. we bought the Dillon's groupon and went last night and it just doesn't even come close for the same amount of money. awesome ambiance to.

OVERPRICED LOUSY bar food.  WTF to this place.  we all ordered the tacos, we could have done better at taco bell,  $15 for two weird overly fishy tacos with a pile of crunchy undercooked plain white rice with a blob of black beans on top. $10 for a plate of rubbery strange tasting wings and the best yet was paying $5 for a SMALL  plate of limp cold garlic fries. it came to $100 including tip for three of us and we were there during happy hour and only had one drink a piece. NEVER EVER again this place sucks, pardon my french lol.

I don't get this place.  Had great service from Summer in the bar but the food is just OK,  $15 for a chimichanga really $15? yes $15 I still am shaking my head over that. I can go to chipolte and get a burrito twice the size with better organic ingredients for less than half that. everytime we go I ask why why but hubby is addicted to the chips and salsa,  whatever it's again OK but I've had way better elsewhere.  Still half of Phoenix thinks this is the best Mexican food around. I just don't get it.

I come here for lunch every now and then and am usually pretty happy with my sandwich. I always get the hell's kitchen its super yummy, egg salad with bacon avocado and a Delicious Cajun spicy mayo on fresh soft sourdough bread.  Last time I was here I got a chicken salad sandwich and was very disappointed just tasted a little funky and I didn't like the dark meat it had in it. Good soups and they have smoothies and ice cream as well.   Definitely not cheap but the sandwiches are so huge I usually split it with who ever I am with.

I collect loose leaf tea and have a over 100 types, so I am always happy when I have a actual store to go in and smell and sample. I buy 75% of my tea on line and Souvia has not changed that for me, I would say I have 9 bags of there tea right now. I am really into the high end blacks and while they do offer a small tiny selection of the super good stuff its usually not what I am looking for. They have alot of flavored tea that is yummy and great for making iced tea, so I still get most of my stuff on line. Love Kerstin and Bret they are very informative and they always have great tea classes so you can learn about tea and preparing it. This is a great shop to stop and get a quick cup of tea and they always have about 3 teas of the day to sample but I live kinda far so I rarely make it over and they are closed on Sunday and that is my day off.

After much prodding from a favorite client to try this place, my husband and I went on Saturday night.  We were seated right away and for being where it is,  it was pretty OK inside. Our waitress was very nice and attentive the whole meal. I had the king tacos ( client's recommendation) and they were Delicious, 3 soft tacos with really good chicken, I don't know what they marinate it in but moist,  flavorful and cooked to perfection, perfectly sauteed onions on top with just the right amount of cheese. I had the horchata and it was excellent. Husband had the Del Ray of course and it kinda grossed me out a bit but he enjoyed it, I had a bite and that was enough, it was huge so he took half home and enjoyed the rest for breakfast the next day, he also ordered a side of beans and they were really good and not your  typical refried beans,  they were a white bean with a little cheese on top, Yummy. he also had the vampiro to drink, it was beets and other veggies juiced and he loved it, it did look just like blood. all in all it was really good andwe will definitely go back.

FYI: Will not accept restaraunt.com coupons.  Printed off the coupon and headed out for the 30 min drive to check this place out  and there was a big sign on the door that said we do not accept restarunt.com coupons., then why are you offering a coupon on there?   We all kinda had a bad taste for this place after we saw the sign and went to switch instead.

Stopped by for lunch today and unfortunately due to a electrical problem they were not serving food. We did buy a 4 pack of the cupcakes everyone is raving about and they truly are hands down the best cupcakes I have ever eaten, they are a total steal at $6 a 4 pack, that is half the price of the other sickly sweet cupcake shops out there, so moist and just right on the frosting, bursting with citrus flavor BRAVO!!!! Also picked up some cerretas chocolate that is amazing as well. Cant wait to go back to eat lunch here.

My Granddaughter just turned two last week and I still didn't know what to get her for her birthday gift. my husband and I took her to the children's museum yesterday and she had such a great time the entire time we were there we became members. Happy Birthday Chloe I know we will be there every Sun and the membership is flexible so her parents can take her or I can take a guest, its really a great deal. Cant wait to go back.

I Dont get the other reviews but this place rules.  Have eatten hear many times and its always really good.  I always get the pastrami on a onion roll,  thin sliced pastrami the way it should be on a nice soft fresh onion roll.  A bit pricy for a sandwich $8.25  but worth it.

This is a tuff review because I LOVE  the drink I get,  but on the other hand I would like to know why the people that work there are so unfriendly and just plain bothered to serve you or take your order for that matter,  forget it if it's a little complicated they just walk away if you start to change it up a bit.  Never eaten the food  it always looks like it going to be dry sitting open in those display cases.

This is my new favorite spot,  so much so we were here 3 times in one week.  The first visit was on a lazy Mon afternoon, We had way to much wine and ate like pigs,  but we couldn't stop,  everything was super amazing.  We finished with a french press and salted Carmel sundae,  I am embarrassed how far my tongue got down the salted Carmel shot glass.  Everything has been said about the food,  its super tasty. favorite thing I ate that day was the ricotta, date, pistachio bruchetta.

Had lunch here on the recommendation of a client and we were not disappointed. We each had 2 pints of the Arizona peach four peaks beer, at only $3 a piece it was a good and super tasty deal. We shared a bowl of the split pea and it was good not great but good, the insalata salad was fantastic as well as the margarita pizza with fresh heirloom tomato's. service was great and very attentive. Lunch was $50 + but it was really good.

This place has some pretty good fast Italian food. The antipasti salad is amazing and we get that every time we go. they have great dinner specials for under 7 and it comes with super yummy garlic rolls. you order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. service is nice and the place is clean hope they make it in that weird location.

Stopped by Sugar Daddy's yesterday and picked up a 4 pack of cupcakes. The deal is now 4 for 12 not 4 for 10 anymore :(   I did the signature, carrot cake, lemon and a red velvet my daughter's favorite. I am not a super sweet type of person and usually scrape frosting off everything and this was no exception. The cupcakes them selves were very moist and tasty. we sampled all 4 and left the 4 remaining halves for her hubby. Very cute shop easy to get in and out for being located in a mall, I just parked outside of forever 21 walked through, it on the right just outside of the front doors.

Stopped in yesterday with my Granddaughter and bought her the vanilla vanilla. I think there is way better choices to make, sickly sweet frosting and lots of it atop a boring kind of stale cupcake with a cherry on top. threw over half of the $3.50 cupcake away couldn't even get a two year old to eat it.

This is the real deal, totally authentic and so so tasty.  A casual place with about 15 or so tables inside a quaint market that you can peruse while you food is being made,  I saw some past reviewers complain about how long it took to get your food, while yes there is a wait it is because your meal is being made on the spot when you order it, anyway walking through the market is a great way to spend that wait.  Hummus was good and the Greek salad is my new favorite,  we also split the combo plate, the chicken shwarma was hands down the best I have ever had and should be dipped in the oh so amazing tazilki sauce,  The chicken kabob should not be missed,  husband had gyros and he was moaning a little inappropriately while eating them.  The guy that owns is not only totally genuine but probably one of the nicest men on the planet.

This review is for dessert only. Came here the other night with a party of four. we just had dessert and it was amazing! We were kinda boring and just got the milk chocolate but it was perfect chocolate with all kinds of yummy treats for dipping, our favorites being the strawberries, cheesecake,  brownies and rice crispy treats, our least favorite was the marshmallows. our waiter was pretty full of his own self importance and a little annoying with his I'm so cool attitude, look at all my cool tattoos. Other than that it was great and we will be back for more of that yummy chocolate.

Just so you don't waste your time like I did, this place is not a full service car wash/ lube center. They offer oil changes and the car wash is a drive through only. The oil change was fine, the guy did get a bit of attitude when I didn't purchase the up-sales he was offering like a new air filter and the upgraded drive through wash. I ended up having to drive to Danny's after my oil change to have my car washed and pay another $20 for that. I usually go to places that do the oil change and throw in a free full service wash for around $30 so I ended up paying $50 for a oil change and car wash. Live and learn just thought I would warn you.

We ordered take out from Stevie's last night and it was just OK.  It has potential to be good if they tweaked a few things.  We ordered the pizza wing combo and a house salad.  Skip the salad its nothing special just bagged iceberg that tastes like bagged salad with some onions that smelled like BO and a few veggies with Italian dressing.  I had a couple bites and the rest just got tossed.  The wings were small and scrawny with no meat on them and the ranch dressing was funky bottled stuff.  Make your own ranch guys its soooo worth it.  The pizza was OK after I reheated it in the toaster over to crisp up the crust.  I will have to pass on Stevie's next time.

Came here yesterday with my two year old granddaughter, a few friends and there kids. This place is pretty amazing and I found myself wishing I was 12 again to enjoy it to the fullest. we paid at the front, it was only $3.50 for a two year old and I was free gotta love that, a super cheep day of fun. We headed back to the 7 and under area called Earthquake. Imagine rows of huge trampolines that you can jump on with your kids. We kept entertained and out of breath by the jumping and the guy that worked there monitoring the area was doing all kinds of cool acrobatics that kept us in awe. all in all a super fun day. needless to say my granddaughter crashed out in the car after her big exciting day on the trampolines. So happy this place is 5 minutes from home we will definitely be back often.

Came here last night with a restaraunt.com coupon.  Sat outside and the patio was nice and our waitress was great, now lets talk about the food,  the menu has changed alot since we were here and not  for the better,  we ordered the guacamole $6.99 for a very small portion of flavorless guac we had to add so much salt just to get any flavor out of it, we ordered the chicken fajitas and it had about six  strips of very dry chicken on a bed of greasy onions and that's it, veggie fajitas were onions and peppers a few mushrooms and a couple pieces of zucchini, everything was so overcooked and caramelized it was just a greasy mess. The rice tasted exactly like rice a roni and the beans tasted soured.  Never again so glad we had the big coupon and didn't pay full price for that crap.

I went the same night Rick H went and had the exact same experience, I think we must have had the same waitress. When we asked what imports she had on tap she listed Bud, Coors, Miller.....LOL She was super sweet and very new so Im sure she will be grerat in a couple weeks. This was our second time in,  We went opening week ( I know my bad) for our first time and waited and hour and a half for the food so tonight's dinner was comped to try to woo us back in.  Nothing stand out here just your Typical Sonora Mexican food nothing special, nothing terrible.  I think the bar will do well and since the closest competition is maccayo's I'm sure this place will do great.  Sorry to say I haven't discovered my favorite new Mexican food place in POPO"s, shame because it''s 5 mins from home.

WAY overpriced and really run of the mill pizza, found the crust to be tasteless and boring and really feel ho hum about the whole meal including the hummus.  The beers were the stars here and if that is what your coming for then you wont be disappointed,  had the orange blossom and it was nothing like I have ever tasted before.  Our waitress was great and brought us several rounds of samples of the beers.  over all just OK and we probably wont go back again. We had two small pizzas one of them cheese the hummus and we each had a beer and it was over $50, Oh and if you sit inside be prepared for very loud music,  we walked in to ACDC highway to hell rocking the house, think yard house loud so if you want to talk or even think you might have a problem.

Stopped in here last night after my sister told me her positive experience she had,  the place was hopping on a sat night and we sat on the patio, good wine, versatile and interesting menu and nice ambiance make for a winning combo. Service is excellent as well as management being super supportive during a issue that was resolved beautifully.
