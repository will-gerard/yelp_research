I'm not really fond of writing sub par reviews. I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my "I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends" template.    Majerle's is one of those experiences.  I know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.  When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.      If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check.    Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine.  Not so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests. Downright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.  If I'm in the area and kind of desperate, perhaps I'll try it again. Probably Not.

I love Thai food. And I like it hot. Thai Lahna wraps these two expectations up in a perfect package. It's the most authentic Thai food in the Valley!  Like so many culinary jewels in the Valley, the restaurant is nestled in a strip mall between a tanning salon and a yoga studio. The tables are covered in the same silks that I brought back with me from my own Thailand adventure and the staff is super friendly.   I am addicted to the hot and sour soup with chicken. It's served piping hot with tons of vegies and even more flavor. I always choose the lemon grass flavor, but I'm sure the coconut one is equally delectable. The Green Curry (#71) is also a favorite because I'm a big fan of bamboo shoots. I usually get it with chicken. I also love the #55 (which I can't actually pronounce, yet alone spell) with beef.    For lunch, the #6 will change your life. I like it with chicken and a TALL glass of water. I always order is spicy but for the faint of heart I would recommend going with the mild version.   I generally order takeout but dining in is also a fun experience. I have not had one bad meal here and the price point is right on! Take a group of friends and have fun!

I must admit, I've only been here for happy hour. However, I go for happy hour about twice a week. What can I say, when I find something I like--I stick to it. The happy hour changes daily. Sundays are my favorite--$5 glasses of wine, select speciality drinks, and specific appetizers are also offered at a reduced price. Thursday is ladies night (half off drinks for the girls all night). The drinks are expected--Trader Vic is famous for his rum concoctions and they are delish (and stroong). You can't go wrong with a Mai Tai but for something truly special, the Colonel's Big Opu is not to be missed.  The food is what I crave though. The most expensive thing on the happy hour menu is $3. Sometimes, I order the whole kittencaboodle just to try and bit of it all. My faves are the hummus, crispy duck bits, and the burger (with sweet potatoe fries).   This is sort of an Old Town treasure than not many are hip to. I've never had a problem finding a seat and in general, most of the other patrons are staying in the  Hotel Valley Ho (next door).  The lack of the 5th star stems from the often sluggish service. I'm never in a real hurry, but I often come starving and thirsty and I hate waiting for a server to have first contact. Once someone knows you're there, things unfold nicely.

There aren't very many times I find a place that is truly special. Special, in my book constitutes a menu that is creative, a staff that is passionate, and ambiance that is electric. Tuck Shop is one of those places. Although small, the space is used well and the theme is eclectic and fun. The food is "neighborhood comfort food" and it doesn't disappoint.   I went with a friend last week and we sat at the bar. It's a unique concept. They have one bottle of everything. One kind of vodka (a brand I haven't heard of and subsequently cannot recall), one kind of rum, gin, tequila, scotch, ect. The wine list is a bit more extensive but  not overwhelming. And they make their own mixers from SCRATCH, which makes the mixed drinks extra special.   We started with the crispy fontina sticks, which were a deliciously more complex take on cheese sticks (a bar food favorite). Next up, we tried the stuffed dates, served on a bed of greens. The dates were stuffed with chorizo and the marriage of sweet and savory was balanced and enjoyable. It wouldn't be comfort food without macaroni and cheese and I wasn't leaving there without eating a WHOLE large bowl full. I decided to try it with lobster and although there wasn't much lobster in it, I realized that for a meager $3 upcharge, I did get at least a few bites! For dessert, we had a pineapple 'right side up cake' and the crispy edge was literally soul melting. There was not one bad bite.   The staff at Tuck Shop is eager to please as well as friendly and knowledgeable. The space is utilized well and although it was fairly busy when I was there, it is set up in a manner that makes the experience intimate.  I will certainly be back.

I have now been to Daily Dose 4 or 5 times and each time has been wonderful. Occasionally, you have to wait at the front for someone to acknowledge you and finally seat you but the short wait is worth it!   They serve breakfast until 3pm during the week and ALL day on the weekends. I enjoy the eggwhite wrap and always look forward to the large breakfast potatoes. My favorite part about breakfast is the homemade jam they bring with toast! I also love their burgers! The food is well cooked, creative, and delicious.   They also have a wonderful happy hour that lasts until 8pm!  The specialty cocktails are clever but some of them are not well executed (too sweet).  I love sitting at the bar or out on the patio. The service is always friendly and everyone seems eager to please. They put cucumber slices in the water which makes the tap water actually taste GOOD. These small attentions to detail really add up and make this place one of my favorites! I drive down from North Scottsdale just to eat here!

I work right down the street from Press and have been a huge fan from my very first visit! The staff is unbelievably friendly and extremely passionate about their craft! Everything from the food to the coffee is first rate! They always accommodate my special requests (a little more of this, none of that) and always make good suggestions when I'm looking for something new.  I love the yogurt and granola parfait (strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola) for breakfast with a white chocolate latte. Also, the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling. For lunch, my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad.  Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around. They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee. I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick!   My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts! The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like you've won the lottery. And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies (warmed up) are a weekly addiction of mine.   Starbucks is a thing of the past. I'm lucky to be in close proximity to Press, but I think I would even make the drive just for that mascarpone cake!
