This has been a devastating few years. It started with me leaving my career as a Firefighter/Paramedic to start my Career as emergency Flight Paramedic. For my first flight, first time in a helicopter the motor shut off at 3k ft. Falling out of the sky did an Auto rotating crash landing tearing the helicopter apart. We all survived 2 of us with back injuries. After being threatened with my job if I filed workman's comp. I got treatment on own. Ending up at West Valley Hospital CT, X-rays and Pain Meds. they gave me to much pain medication and I quit breathing (died) they were able to recessitate me. I woke up in the ICU 3 days later. In fear of what happened dazed and confused. I left west valley and continued treatment at Banner hospital. I ended up in west valley hospital 4 more times (not by choice the Ambulance decided since it was closest) over 4 year span with major abdominal, back and nerve issues. Because my medical record showed an overdose they treated me like a drug seeker being rude, talking down to me and said "if your here for pain Meds I see you were in here with an over dose so we will not give you pain Meds so if that's what your looking for you can keep looking"I never asked for them  ever asked for anything accept to find out what's wrong. in fact I was in fear of getting Meds from them so I would of refused them. I've never been treated so bad made me feel like I was doing something wrong, I felt ashamed when I did nothing to deserve that.  Later I found out They had hired new nursing graduates to work the ER often left them alone with minimal experience having to track down another nurse to make sure they had given patient care correctly. Me listening to it all from my ER room with curtain walls. Save your time and money and maybe your life and go to another hospital.    In 2013 my wife went in to labor early. Having a prolapsed cord (delivering the umbilical cord before the baby). She was prepped for an emergency C-section, it went well thank God. Not sure if someone or something was not sterile because she ended up with a postpartum infection they sent her home within 3 hours, she had a fever of 105 and was re-admitted to the hospital for a week. They gave her 3 IV bags of Antibiotics a day for 4 days in a row killing her infection but also killing her good Bacteria making her sick again with GI issues and led to a Seizure. she was sent home still not feeling so well. On her second day home she was standing and holding our New Born baby to her chest. I was walking away to the restroom when I heard a thud and our Baby started Screaming. I turned around our baby was on the floor and so was my wife she was having a full blown seizure. And never had one before in her life. Our baby appeared to be ok thank God. But the seizure my wife was having made her quit breathing her mouth was clinched shut she turned blue then grayish/white. I called 911 watching the time 4 minutes had passed and the convolutions finely stopped leaving her pale lifeless body laying there. I attempted to give her breaths through her nose (Her jaw was still clinched shut) I had no success then at 4 minutes and 34 seconds  (felt like an hour) her nose flared and she began to get her color back. She was taken to west valley hospital it was the closest hospital. They watched her for 20 minutes and said to us "it probably wasn't a seizure" and said to a co-worker as they walked away another seeker. We were in disbelief. So they discharged her from the ER we got in the car just pulled out of the parking lot and she had another seizure in the car. So I quickly pulled back in the Ambulance entrance. I walked in and yelled my wife is actively seizing please help. One young guy walked fast out and everyone else stood and stared at me one said how did you get in here you need to use the main entrance. They stopped the seizure ended up admitting her for 2 days and started her on Seizure meds. They were a bit nicer but not much. The possible causes for her seizures were Meds they gave her or the large amounts of antibiotics. After all this we decided to move away from west valley insurance covered most of the bills we never got a bill for the hospital stays assuming it was covered or since they made so many mistakes they didn't charge us. We got a letter from an attorney we had owed $200 but they had our address wrong so we never got the bill after calling multiple times going to the billing dept. And they refused to see us said it was too late to pay it. they turned it in to collections just like that $200 turned in to $4,000 in fees and now that I'm selling my house they put a lien on my house and are taking it out of our equity. Our equity is our life savings! all of our savings is gone from time missed at work and loosing our jobs due to medical issues.!  Wow! Talk about sucking a person dry and sucking the life from them! You are a horrible hospital with rude staff with no empathy or manners

I was treated like a criminal! In March 2015 I went in to the store excited to get som new things in a great mood following a great day I shopped for over a half an hour. Picked out quite a few things including a few toys and some clothes. There was a woman and man working that night I was so upset by the time I left I have forgotten their names he is a Clearly Gay man heavy set dark hair and short for a man and she was about 5"7 not heavy set but a bit larger than average dark hair. but anyway both sales people were following me around the entire time I was in there every time I looked at something they would follow behind me inspecting things I touched. When I was looking at the Sex toys the Guy stood there and he had the audacity to say to me quote " Hunny that toy is too big for your tight little Pu@?y how much can you fit in there"????? What the Hell??????  I just ignored him and he went behind the counter. she kept following me around. I walked up to the counter asked for the dressing room and put all my stuff on the counter took the Bikini top I wanted to try on 1 item tried it on it didn't fit. When I went back to the counter to pay for my things he rang up $256 worth of stuff.  Then the Girl the looked at me and said "ok where is it" I said what are you talking about she replied the "Dildo you stole" I replied kindly I didn't steal anything I have better morals than that. They grabbed my bag and took everything out on to the counter then said its not in here, that they need to pat me down. And began to pat me down  I was ready to call the cops not only did I not consent to being touched I said no!!!  But was very intimidated I didn't know what to do. I just felt When it was done it would prove I was innocent. After the search I was thinking to my self ok now I'm going to get an apology and how do I reply this is bull crap. but no that did t happen the girl said "on your good you put it inside you didn't you"? I said What! your crazy your not going near there I'm wearing Super tight Yoga pants and said really!!! Where would out it? and left. I have never been so mistreated or offended in my life!!!!! I'm considering filing a law suit. Stay away from this place
