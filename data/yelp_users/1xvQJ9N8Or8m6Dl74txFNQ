Meh. Service was not very quick but it was friendly. The sushi was decently priced but seemed uninspired and was not particularly fresh. The spring rolls were strange to say the least, mushy inside with a fried doughy shell instead of the usual flaky shell. Not worth the trip in our opinion.

Being new to the Phoenix area we were looking forward to finding a Thai restaurant, since we eat Thai fairly often. Going off of the Yelp reviews, we decided to try Swaddee. We ordered the Tom Ka soup with tofu instead of chicken, and the Pad See-ew with soft tofu, and the veggie rolls (to go). The veggie rolls were tasty and larger than we're used to, which was a nice surprise. The Tom Ka soup was a little more sour than we're used to, but overall still tasty. However, it was almost $11 which we felt was about double what it should have cost. The Pad See-ew was the most disappointing part of the meal. The flavor was fine, nothing special but not bad. However, it was pretty dry and sticky, like you'd expect from a cheap college Thai take-out joint.  Overall nothing really stood out. We had high hopes since the meals were on the pricey end for take-out, but we've had far better Thai for half the price. We'll keep looking for a better Thai place to become our local go-to!

Came here on a Wednesday night to see Cage the Elephant. When we arrived (just before headliner) there was exactly one parking space that had apparently just opened up. Parking was $5. Carpooling seems to be a good idea. I was disappointed to find that when you buy tickets at the window there is a "$3-$5 service fee" whatever that means. For two of us the total was $56. We were then directed into a security line. Didn't know I was going to an international airport. We were asked to empty our pockets and then patted down. Then our ID's were scanned, and all pictures from the licenses of the 21+ are saved on their computer. Seriously, what?  Inside we went to the bar and our buddy asked what they had in the arena of cheap beer. The bartender said "Nothing." Turns out the cheap stuff is $6 for what looked like a 14oz cup, decent stuff is $7. Apparently now we're in L.A. Decided to wait on drinking until after the show.    The actual theater is an arena style, standing-only, big cement floor that gradually slopes down towards the stage. The show was fine, sound was a little meh but seemed to improve throughout the night. I wish the most memorable part was the band, but instead we spent most of the time watching the power-trippy security team descend on their prey and kick out person after person. Put a big damper on the atmosphere. We've never been to a venue where security was even that noticeable, much less this overdone. In general the whole vibe of the place was something along the lines of "YOU MUST FOLLOW ALL OF OUR MANY RULES. FUN COMES LAST."  Yeah...we'll be sticking with Club Red.

Mmm...came here the other night before a show at ASU Gammage. We had a group of six around a big round corner booth. Very comfortable and great laid-back tavern vibe. Our server was vibrant (literally - with purple hair and purple fingernails) and very friendly, we enjoyed her a lot. We ordered the blackened salmon Caesar salad and it was perfect. Juicy tender salmon with lots of blackened seasoning. The dressing was VERY good, not your average grocery store Caesar. Our friends had the fish and chips, the turkey crossaint, and the blackened salmon berry salad. Great reviews all around. The berries were amazing. The clam chowder was also very good.  Decent beer list as well and very reasonable prices - something like $3.50 for a pint of a good IPA or a Blue Moon.  It wasn't even Happy Hour!  Definitely looking forward to returning.  Only complaint is the same with many venues around Phoenix: the patio was way too smokey to even consider sitting out there.

S.O. here: Moved to the Tempe area for the winter and needed a chiropractor. Found Dr. Reed through great reviews on Yelp. I've had a fantastic experience so far - Megan and Dr. Reed are both incredibly friendly and efficient. I've been to SO many chiropractors over the years so have definitely had my share of bad experiences (painful adjustments, pressure to come in several times a week, expensive adjustments, unnecessary x-rays, rude staff). After my first couple visits I told Sam that my experience had been more of a combination of all the best things I've experienced in chiropractic, namely: Friendly staff, comfortable adjustments, very reasonable prices, massage table pre-adjustment, great communication from the Dr. with specific goals that we are working towards, and very satisfactory results. They make it very clear that they are in the business because they care about people, not dollar signs.  We are planning on returning to Phoenix and probably living in North Phoenix, but I'll be happy to make the drive to continue seeing Dr. Reed.

This was one of the best all-around restaurant experiences we've had in a long time! Pulled in to discover free valet, beautiful landscaping, and a classy entrance. Both the interior of the restaurant and the patio have elegant, modern decor. I was impressed down to the thought-out ceiling of the bathroom! The hostess was incredibly friendly and pointed out exactly where the person was that we were meeting. A very nice gesture, she seemed to know we hadn't met him before :) The bar is an indoor/outdoor setup, and we ordered a white sangria (YUM!) and a Green Flash IPA (pretty standard, nothing too special). We were seating within 15 minutes. Fantastic wait service, very positive and was at our table the perfect amount of times. Very gracious and gave us suggestions based on what the wait staff like to eat, which if you have worked in the restaurant industry, you know to listen!   We started with the guacamole and salsa. The tomatillo salsa was roasted and had a unique flavor, we really liked it. The guac was just fantastic, very flavorful. We really like garlic in our guac and you could definitely taste it. Even the chips seemed well thought-out, a unique shape and puffy rather than your standard Tostito. They brought us more chips for free. For dinner we split an order of the Seared Ahi Tacos - WOW. Impressive all around. The menu specified that the Ahi was sashimi grade, which we were glad to see. It was perfectly seared and melt-in-your-mouth tender. I wouldn't be surprised if they make the corn tortillas there. They are on the smaller end (so you can eat more tacos, of course) and nicely grilled. They arrived wrapped and warm. The tacos also came with a very unique kale slaw instead of just your standard lettuce, which we absolutely loved. They also came with more guac, roasted salsa, black beans, a creamy sauce that we are used to having with fish tacos, and wedges of lime. They bring the plate to you fajita-style, so you decide what to put on your tacos. We were literally saying "Oh my god, so good." pretty much the entire meal. Wish we could have tried dessert but after splitting an appetizer three ways and an entree two ways, we literally couldn't eat another bite. We had to struggle to finish the tacos.   We were wearing dressy casual clothes (jeans/button up shirt for him, sweater/jeans/boots for her) and felt very appropriately dressed. The prices are in the medium range here, but well worth it. You get exactly what you pay for - very quality food in large quantities! Definitely make a reservation if you are going for dinner - we went on a Wednesday night with a reservation and still waited about 15 minutes. We can definitely see why this place is so popular. We are new to the area and can't wait to take friends and family to Chelsea's Kitchen when they visit!

Don't really have anything original to say here, just another big win thanks to Yelp! The roasted corn pizza was indeed the best part of the night. GET IT. Avocado pizza with lemon zest was also good, but we'll probably switch that one up next time. Split a pitcher of white sangria between three of us, definitely yummy. Not very strong but great flavor. We were way too full to try the gelato but plan on that next time!  We had a lot of fun walking through the grocery beforehand as well, lots of unique and fun things, as well as AMAZING smells. Oh, that homemade pizza crust...yum.

Mmm...came to The Vig last year when visiting a friend in Phoenix and had a fantastic lunch experience. Came again a few nights ago to experience the late night menu. We were in around 12:30am, and were promptly greeted with fantastic and quick service even though the place was pretty packed. We ordered the nachos with no meat and extra guac. They were EPIC. Some of the best nachos we've ever had. Full of toppings, crispy, warm, delicious, plentiful. Wow. Our friends ordered the artichoke dip (yum) and the edamame (good but damn pricy for an item that is usually less than $2 at most establishments). My SO ordered a margarita and it was alright - a little watery and the most prominent flavor was the margarita mix instead of tequila. Overall a fantastic joint with a great vibe - will definitely be returning. Looking forward to a round of bocce ball next time.

Five star experiences so far! A friend brought us to the Lost Leaf last year when we were visiting the area, and we loved how unique it was. We were really looking forward to finding it again when we moved to the area and have talked it up to countless people. Last night we were driving to FilmBar, looked over, and there it was! Couldn't resist stopping by after the movie. We love the live music (which they have almost every night of the week) and beer selection (all bottled). We were pleasantly surprised to find one of our favorite beers from back home in Michigan. The prices are very reasonable. The bartenders both times were very nice and we only waited a little bit for a table. It is a smaller venue - in a converted house on a street of galleries and coffee shops that have all been converted. It is a great little area where you definitely find locals and not tourists! Limited seating and space when it is busy, but it's the kind of place where you should be talking to your neighbor anyway. Only one bathroom, so watch for when there is no line!  We'll be here again and again, I'm sure. It's the sort of place that you want to take your visiting family and friends so they think Phoenix is super cool :)

(From Sam's wife) I was seriously impressed with my experience with Lionel - enough so that I'm writing this review immediately on arriving home from my appointment! He returned my message within a couple minutes and got me in for a haircut the next morning. He was waiting at the door when I arrived, offered me coffee, and immediately made me feel welcome. I had some issues with my previous stylist, and I didn't even need to explain what bothered me about the cut. It was clear he understood my hair type and how to work with it. Looking for a new stylist is so stressful and all of a sudden all that anxiety has just melted away. My only regret is not going to him months ago! Lionel has gained a new regular customer, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone.

Best part: loved the beer list. Lots of delicious and unique craft brews. Looks like there are some great brewery events here, signed up for the email list and hoping to catch a few. We were here late on a busy Friday night with a group of six. There was one table left that we were able to squeeze around. We ordered some late night food - sandwiches, burgers, nachos, sweet potato tots. We all felt like the food was fine, but just fine. Everything could have been a little better. Our friend's burger was ordered med-rare and wasn't really pink at all. The breakfast menu looks pretty promising. I guess we'll have to try some food here during regular meal hours. Very friendly service.

To steal a phrase from another reviewer, definitely a solid experience. We rarely go to any sort of chain restaurant for a nice dinner and were pleasantly surprised by Z'Tejas. This one is located in Fashion Square, a beautiful and very busy part of Scottsdale.   We had a couple frozen chambord margaritas...wow. Absolutely delicious and somewhat lethal! Had a wonderful server, all smiles and at our table just the right amount of times. Started with the table-side guacamole, where the server brings all the ingredients and you choose what you would like to be included. We said "Just throw it all in!" and were not disappointed. A little less "authentic" than some would like - it included cheese and jalapenos - but we thought it was tasty nonetheless. It also included a bowl of salsa that was on the good end of pretty standard. The cast iron cornbread that they start you off with is pretty drool worthy - has pieces of corn in it and is perfectly warm and moist.   For dinner we ordered the Southwestern Caesar salad with Ruby Trout instead of chicken. The dressing definitely has a little kick to it. The salad was huge, definitely big enough to split between two people. The fish was well prepared, very tender and a perfect addition to the salad. It arrived tossed in the dressing and we both asked for an extra side of dressing as it was a little bit dry.   Medium price range for large servings and very good food/drinks. Happy with our experience and will probably go back at some point if we have a visitor in the mood for southwestern cuisine.  EDIT: Went to the Tempe location last night, split the seafood enchiladas and they were VERY good. Of course had another Chambord margarita, just as good as the last ones! And oh, that cornbread...wow.

We are vegetarians and found Woodlands the day we moved to the area. We got the Butter Masala and the vegetable soup (got take-out). The portions were big and prices were good. The Masala was wonderful - creamy, savory, extra tomato-y, and a little bit spicy, which was perfect. I ordered the veggie soup for my lady who was sick that night, and it ended up being the ideal thing. Delicious broth, not too spicy, kind of like the Indian equivalent of a good chicken noodle soup. But vegetarian. We will absolutely be ordering from Woodlands again - what a nice introduction to the Phoenix area!  EDIT: We've just ordered take-out from Woodlands again (probably will happen pretty often) and got the Vegetable Curry which was nearly as fantastic as the Masala. The order came with a couple yummy sides: a yogurt sauce and a gingery concoction. We also got the lentil soup this time and wanted to post a WARNING to fellow Yelpers: This soup is SO SO SO SO SPICY, I absolutely love spicy food and couldn't finish it. Not for the faint of heart!

We came to Sens since it was pretty much the highest rated restaurant within walking distance of FilmBar. Thank you Yelp! We had a fantastic experience here. Loved the decor and atmosphere both inside and out. Decent prices for tapas style plates, and we were actually pleasantly surprised at how much food each item included. We split three dishes and a pot of Hot and Sour soup between four people, and couldn't even finish everything! They have a pretty good mix of Asian cuisine and some very unique dishes. We got the Papaya Soba Spring Rolls - they were the kind of rolls you'd get at a Vietnamese place - with a red pepper sauce with crushed peanuts. The sauce had a decent kick to it. The rolls were fresh and tasty. We also got the Ginger Fish - YUM. Very tender, great sauce, tender veggies, a real kick in the taste buds. Delicious. Our friend ordered the Sugarcane Pork since we had seen some great reviews on Yelp and LOVED it - it came in a pretty nifty serving dish with four cups and some sweet mushroom sauce in the bottom of each one. We're vegetarian so had to take his word for it :)  Finally we ordered a pot of the Hot and Sour soup with fish. Wow. So completely unique and different from any Hot and Sour soup we've ever had. All three of us agreed that each bite had like three or four distinct flavors to it. It included okra, mushrooms, fish, snow peas, rice ovalettes, cilantro, and I don't even know what else.   The only drawback and our reason for not giving five stars: The drink menu. While it was pretty enormous, the server went down the beer list and told us everything they were out of, which included most of the beer list and my favorites. I finally ordered one I wasn't that excited about, and then lo and behold, they were out of that too! So no drinks for me or our friend. My lady ordered the Ginger Peach sake cocktail. The $10 price made me cringe a little, but we hoped it would be worth it. You could definitely taste the sake, but it didn't seem like anything special and was not very big at all. Definitely way overpriced.   We'll be back for sure - but next time we'll wait to drink until we go to Filmbar or Lost Leaf where the drink prices are so much more reasonable.

Five stars for the great price and incredibly friendly service! And the food was good too :)  We are new to the area and have a favorite sub place back in Michigan called Jersey Giant where everything is freshly sliced and huge. We don't eat very much bread so it is a treat for us to share a big veggie sub. We are NOT fans of Subway at all, and were sort of resigned to just not having subs while in AZ, but then noticed this place very close to where we are living. After checking out the Yelp reviews we decided to give it a shot. Atmosphere was very mom and pop - I think the owners were working that day and they were very nice and joking around with us. Clean place, line not too bad.  We are vegetarian so didn't benefit from the freshly sliced deli meat part of it, and were just a little bummed to see that the cheese is not freshly sliced. We ordered a $5 foot-long cheese mix with only provolone. The sub was very well made - perfect amounts of toppings, a generous amount of cheese, and toppings out to the edges (important since we are always splitting). We ordered it exactly like we get at Jersey Giant - standard dress (LOVE the oregano) with extra tomatoes, banana peppers, and extra mayo. It was super delicious, almost as good as our favorite sub ever, so we were happy! Will definitely be back for our once-in-a-while sub treat.

Dora and team are amazing. We have two rough coated collies who I'm sure provide a challenge to any groomer. I've never been 100% satisfied after a grooming so have continued to shop around the Phoenix area. I brought them to Dora in July before we went on a big trip to Michigan for seven weeks. When I went to pick them up I was SPEECHLESS. They looked and felt like clouds, it was amazing. There were no awkward scissor lines anywhere - they were beautifully blended and rid of what seemed like pounds of undercoat. Dora even brushes their teeth! Friends and family complimented them all summer long. We just went in for our second appointment and I'm just as happy. Thank you Dora!

Wow. Thank goodness. After a few very disappointing tries, we finally found our Thai place in Phoenix. Everything about our experience here deserved five stars.  Beautiful restaurant - classy decor with dark wood and red glass tile all around the bar area. Certainly not what we expected when headed to a strip mall. Incredibly friendly service throughout the meal between the bartender and server. Nice bathrooms, ample parking, full bar, and TV's at the bar if you want that sort of thing.  Based on Yelp reviews we started with the crab puffs. They are on the happy hour menu - $2 off the order for a total of $4 for six crab puffs. The best we've ever had! SO much delicious filling, and the sauce was great as well. Perfectly fried. Beautiful presentation as well.  For dinner we ordered a small order of Tom Ka soup mild with tofu, and Pad Se-eew medium with fried tofu. These are our two Thai food staples, and we REALLY wanted to like them here.  Whew!! Not only were they good, we agreed that they were among the best we've ever had. The soup seemed very authentic with fantastic flavor and tons of veggies. Exactly what I want every bowl of Tom Ka to be. The Pad Se-eew was drool worthy. PERFECT amount of gravy, incredibly savory, tofu was very tender and not over-fried. The menu said it would include chinese broccoli, and we thought about asking for only regular broccoli since we tend to prefer that, but decided to wait and see how it would turn out. It actually came with a combination of broccoli and chinese broccoli, and both were delicious!   Small criticism that is completely overshadowed by our wonderful dining experience: the only thing that needs to change is their website. The happy hour specials are outdated and according to a sign at the restaurant the hours are about to change as well. Beyond that, we couldn't have been happier with our experience. We were smiling the whole way home! Can't wait to return. Mmmmmm.

We were extremely impressed with Robert! After contacting several companies for a quote for a sliding door replacement I received exactly one response. Robert emailed a full quote to me the same day as my initial call. He responded quickly to all questions and gave us a great price. He was willing to work with us on a somewhat short timeline and the installation was quick and thorough. We LOVE the new door. We will absolutely be working with Robert when we are ready to replace our windows!

I completely agree with the review written by Taylor M. The only exposure I'd had with Guadalupe were driving through it on the way to south mountain park, and it didn't look very impressive. However, this shop is near by and most of the reviewers gave it high marks.  I'm happy to report that I had a great experience there! I spoke with the owner Renee and he was very friendly and helpful. I had a pretty basic issue: I needed a new tube for my road bike tire. I'm new to road bikes so I wanted to learn how to change the tube in case I ever need to in a pinch. I told Renee this and he walked me through step-by-step how to change the tube and told me all of the common mistakes that people make. Just what I needed!  Their prices are very reasonable (less than $10 for the tube and labor), so no complaints there!  Other reviewers have criticized their hours, but I checked their website before driving over and it says right on the website that their hours can fluctuate by season, so I just called before hand to make sure they'd be around. This is (literally) a mom and pop store, so hours will fluctuate from time to time I'm sure.  As long as you call ahead to make sure they're around, you'll get excellent friendly service at an unbeatable price. I'll be back next time I need something for my bike!

We just purchased a new house in Phoenix with an existing ADT system. Instead of uninstalling the system, a local ADT representative (Steve) offered us a two-month trial to see if we wanted to keep it. We said sure, why not - we've never had home security and thought it was worth a shot. ADT tried to bill us twice during the two months and we had to endure the phone system in order to get the charges removed. Now that our two months is coming to a close, I've tried to call and cancel four times. When I finally got through to someone, they told me ADT does not honor trial periods, and that we would be paying a cancellation fee of OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS to cover the next three years. I want this out in public, future home owners be warned. Do not fall for this scam. We are still waiting for someone from ADT to come forward and make this right. Surely someone in this company has a working moral compass. The local representative (Steve) who offered us the two month "deal" told us it is our problem now, and that he could possibly get the contract downsized to a year. Dirty, slimy business dealings ADT.  Update: The representative who contacted me a week ago called me today after two emails and a phone call asking for a resolution. The bottom line is that literally nothing has changed - they are sticking with the "offer" of reducing our contract to one year instead of three. I reminded him that he agreed with me that it was a very shady situation and that we had been "hooked in" (his own words) and then asked how it was worth it for ADT, as a business, to continue to try and get $300 out of us rather than stand behind their word and protect their reputation. Apparently it isn't! So, all the reviews will stay, all the reviews on Yelp, Facebook, Twitter, etc., and I will continue to add them. A huge thank you to those who have offered their support and those who are spreading the word. ADT is not an honest company and have made it abundantly clear that they do not care about their customers. I have not been surprised to find many more scathing reviews as I have added mine to the bunch.   ADT, I suppose I should thank you for showing your true form and making it easy to warn people away from your business. I hope it was worth it. Enjoy your $300!

Went for a couple late-night drinks, sat on the patio and our heat lamp kept us nice and toasty on a chilly night. Didn't try the food but we were very happy with the beer. We were there for reverse happy hour - discounted draft beers until close. My lady was thrilled to find that they have Triple Karmeliet from Belgium on tap, one of her very favorite beers that is not easy to find in the states. At least in Michigan where we're from :)  My friend and I ordered an IPA, I'm an IPA buff and really liked it. It was more on the bitter end, not very sweet. Wish I could remember the name, will edit this review if we go there again.   Great service and overall a satisfactory experience for a couple of beers to finish off the night. The inside seemed very nice (fireplace, modern decor) and the bathrooms were very nice as well. If we're back in the area I'm sure we'll return for at least a drink.

Fantastic experience - bartender was super friendly, the beer list was HUGE and high quality, prices were unbeatable. We saw "Being Elmo" for $5, can't say we've ever literally smiled through an entire film before! And when we were finished, voila! already at the bar! Beautiful space, very cool decor and tons of seating. Close to some good food and good bars as well. We will be frequenting Filmbar with our handy dandy punch card!

Rob is wonderful to work with. We've had him clean our 16 ft sectional twice now - the first time was right after we bought it used and he completely transformed it. He even cleaned the throw pillows! He is responsive, professional, thorough, and extremely friendly. He returned my message immediately, scheduled me right then, and kept me posted via text before he showed up for the appointment. He was also very patient with our three dogs who decided that he was a brand new intruder every time he went out to his van :) Look no further - you won't find someone else who does business this well!

Amazing sushi - fresh, beautifully plated, always a treat. The rice to filling ratio in the sushi rolls is perfect. The nigiri is awesome. We were despairing over the lack of really good sushi in Phoenix after moving here a couple years ago, and then Harumi opened and our lives changed! Juno often comes over to speak with us and we've been treated to complimentary edamame, rolls, desserts, and sometimes even wine. We feel valued as customers and have truly never had a sub-par experience here. Pro tip: Try the Omakase!

We're biking over for happy hour tonight, so with looking forward to it all day I figured it was finally time to write the WP a review!   Greg, owner/bartender, is extremely knowledgeable about everything on the beer and wine list. He is always in a good mood, dancing around, offering chocolate around the bar, and making conversation. Even with a packed bar he will be in front of you ready for an order if your glass is even close to empty. We've found several new favorites thanks to his recommendations.  We are big beer people (Sam is a serious homebrewer) and the selection of good brews here is just absurd. What is even more absurd is the happy hour - EVERY day until 8pm?! Tack on the delicious cheese plate and damn.  This is a perfect neighborhood bar unique in its small size and friendly atmosphere. The old board games and boxes of trivial pursuit cards are a bonus. Where else do you get to drink Bells Hopslam and school your friends in Let's Go Fishin? I share the sentiment of wanting to give WP one star just to leave more room for ourselves, but obviously couldn't do that with a business that is doing everything right. Pretty sure our home value went up just being near this place. Keep up the good work, Greg!
