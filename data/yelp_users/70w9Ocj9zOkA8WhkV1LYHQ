We have been using PreFlight for several years now for both business and personal trips. Their customer service is top notch. They are always there to pick us up in a heartbeat, handle all our luggage and are very pleasant. Last night we flew in after a 4+ hour flight and my car battery was dead. The driver called for help right away and within 3 minutes we were on our way! The gal that brought the jumpers even brought us each a bottle of water. The trip before that I had completely misplaced my ticket to get out. I showed them my rental car receipt and told them what time I arrived and there were no hassles whatsoever! Also nice that you can either prebook and pay online before your trip (very nice when you are on vacation to know this is already paid for when you get home) or print coupons (which are consistent) to use on your way out. A+ PreFlight! You are the best!

Buyer beware. This store will lie to you. I went in to get a new phone and was offered a free tablet. I asked what kind, they rattled off some name I'd never heard before. I said I only use apple. The store manager told the sales guy to give me an apple. I asked several questions to ensure it was free and I would be paying for the device. They said I would pay $15/mo for 1GB of data (I was only getting this as a back up for when I travel in case my phone dies and I need to use it for directions as I already have a iPad). They said that was the cheapest plan and reiterated the device was free. That was in October. My account has been consistently chafed $17/mo for the device in addition to the $15 I agreed to. Have called the store 3 times now, first time manager agreed it should be free and he would fix it. I got one $17 credit but it didn't continue. Called again, different store manager would research it and call me back within 2 hours. That was 2 weeks ago. Called again tonight and got a very rude "acting manager" that said they couldn't discuss my account over the phone that I had to come in. I told him I guess he didn't like helping customers. Just spent 45 minutes on the phone by calling main Sprint # and now they are trying to figure it out for me and are supposed to get back with me tomorrow. Fingers crossed!

I am at this store ALOT!  Love it.  Staff is always very helpful when I am there and if you spend at least $75, ask them for the "mall discount", you'll get another 15% off!

This place is fantastic and Tracy B. rocks!  Have never had better hair since I started going here about 6 months ago.  Upper scale feel but not outrageously priced!

Great breakfast and great lunch.  Haven't tried them for dinner yet.  Healthy choices, fantastic waitresses and fun decor.  You can't beat Heart and Soul Cafe!

They do good nails, but I am not a fan of having to wait when I have an appointment scheduled and watch new customers take a turn in front of me because they think I will keep coming back. Typical visit for pedicure and fill was 3 - 4 hours. I don't have that kind of time on my hands and don't appreciate the disrespect.

I have never, I mean never NOT tipped.... until I went to Spazzi Nails.  Went for a pedicure and the paint job looked like a 5 year old did it.  I pointed out I had nail polish overflowing from my toenails onto my cuticles and skin and they looked at me like I was nuts.  What happened to the customer is always right?  Princess Nails across the street (in the Walgreens center) is MUCH better.

I bought a Groupon for this place as I was intrigued by a friend of mine who swears by this place.  Not for me.  I had a fantastic massage 1/2 hour before my float at the Massage Envy across the street and I'm pretty sure I ruined all the good the massage did in this float session.  Its painful through the shoulders and neck as others state its hard to let your body float the first time, but I was nausous afterwards and I just can't see how anyone would pay to feel this way.  It didn't take the pain away in my lower back as I had hoped and now my neck is all stressed along with my shoulders.  Others Yelped that the Oxogyn bar is free, I was told I could add it on for 10 bucks - passed on that.  I felt uneasy an on pins an needles all evening after floating.  I am very in tune with my body and realize that epson salts release toxins, I take them at home and also get regular massages and adjustments.  This was just too completely weird, couldn't wait to get out of there.  Also, I don't understand how they clean these things.  Apparently, some cleaning device starts up right after the float, which I heard go on, but did not see any water draining and when I left 10 minutes later, the tub was still full.  I don't think they drain the water - ew!  Oh, and you have to sign a waiver that you will pay them $500 if you pee or deficate in the tub - really?

Cafe Provence is now serving Sunday Brunch.  My husband and decided to try it this morning and it was fantastic.  We have never been to this restaurant, but it will surely become a regular place for us as we go out to breakfast most Sundays.  Prices were reasonable, food was fantastic, service outstanding.  The owner is super nice and attentive.  You can't go wrong with Cafe Provence.  I'm looking forward to trying their lunch and dinner menu soon, which both look fabulous!  Try it, you'll like it!

Went for breakfast the other day. Very few tables in the place and 2 waitresses, so you think we would have had good service, NOT!  We waited 1/2 hour for our food and they messed up my order, so had to send it back.  The waitress apologized, but then proceeded to blame the cook saying she wish she could fire him because he messes up all the time (so professional!).  $25 for breakfast for 2 people is a little steep if you ask me, for that kinda money, I would expect top notch service. Food wasn't bad, but in the future, you'll find me at Denny's across the street which has consistent service and quality.

We ate here for the first time tonight and are thrilled to have this little gem in our neighborhood. Its decorated very festive, service and food were all great.  With not much to offer in the way of restaurants in our neighborhood, we welcome Plaza Bonita with open arms.  We'll be back!

Well, I disagree with the previous reviewer.  We love Tao Kitchen.  We've only sat down and eaten there once, but order take out a lot now.  The time we ate there, the service was fine, the won ton's were fine, I didn't care for the soup, but i don't really like soup anyway.  The orange chicken is the absolute best and we had the orange beef this week and it was very good too - not overbreaded, just darn good!  Their egg rolls are great and their crab puffs are mighty tasty as well.  Their lunch specials are a fantastic deal.  You get the same amount as you do at dinner, for a lot cheaper and lunch specials run until 4.  We sometimes go before 4 and just pick up dinner early to save a few bucks.  i welcome this gem to the neighborhood and hope they do well - we'll be crushed if they don't!

RIP OFF ALERT!  Although I have never had any dry cleaning done here, I have had alterations done here twice.   I wouldn't dream of taking my dry cleaning here after seeing their prices for cleaning.  I took an evening dress in to be hemmed last year which was lined and it cost me $35.  I was told the price was doubled as it was lined.  Fair enough.  Earlier this week, I took another evening dress in to be hemmed.  Before I knew it she had pinned it all down the sides telling me it was way too big.  I lost 5 lbs since I bought it, not significant.  I asked her how much it would be to take it in (we hadn't even discussed the hem price yet) and she told me $120.  I told her we needed a plan B.  I asked her how much it would be to shorten the straps and she stated that since there were jewels on them it would be $25.  Thought that was a little pricey, but given I needed it done within the week I agreed.  For the hem she quoted me $25, as well. I told her last year I paid $35 for a lined dress and was told it was double the price since it was hemmed, so shouldn't the hem be more like $18?  She just ignored me.  So I gave in for the $50 price.  I also told her I would like it pressed.  When i went to pick up the dress today, the total was $67.95.  Are you kidding me?  I asked the gentleman behind the counter how much it cost to have it pressed and he showed me the ticket.  She had charged me $60 for the alterations instead of the agreed upon $50.  I told him what she had quoted me and he stated he would have to call her (given that I am pretty sure this is his wife, I found that pretty stupid, but whatever).  When he got her on the (speaker) phone, they proceeded to chat in another language and he told me that the straps were $35.  I argued that she quoted me $25 and then he handed me the phone.  She stated she said $35 because of the jewels.  I told her I didn't appreciate her calling me a liar and I know what I heard.  After a nice little argument (isn't it nice to argue with your customers - - or in this case ex-customer) she gave in and took $10 off like she was doing me a big favor.  I am one of the most honest people you will meet.  I pay attention when someone quotes me a price, I know what I heard and it wasn't $35.

My husband and I had dinner here this evening and it was Fantastic. We split a rack of baby back ribs and a Greek salad. The ribs were smoky, tender and just had an overall great flavor. They bring you a sweet sauce and a spicy. I had the sweet, which had a little bit of a kick too it. Really tasty. My husband had the spicy and loved it. The owners are super nice, ensuring we had everything we needed and our waitress was very attentive as well. On the way out I couldn't resist getting their oatmeal coconut cookies. Wow!  It is so nice to have a family run business close by that serves breakfast lunch and dinner. Great job, Tennessee Grill!  We'll see you soon!
