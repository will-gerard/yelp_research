This place is a little hole in the wall.. stopped here to eat with a great of 6 friends amazing food. . Great atmosphere and service.. I used to live in Miami FL for a few years so its a little hard to find Cuban food. . Let alone good Cuban. . This is now a staple for every time I come to Vegas!! Everyone's food was great.  Very very large amounts of food. . Hot and fresh. . Drinks were also really good. . Will be back thank you. .

Love love love this place!  Always have a great time with the ladies drinks are avg price. . Only thing I would suggest is on a Friday or Saturday night get another waitress for the floor. . Always have to wait a long time for your drinks.  And she is clearly working hey tail off. But great music playing always will always come back here for ladies night

Dignity Health Urgent Care - Very fast prompt and great fast health care. Got me right in had 2 dr. there and friendly staff. Gave me all the RX I needed to get rid of the upper chest cold that I have had for 2 weeks. Even went the extra step to do a chest X-ray and make sure I didn't have pneumonia. Thank you for the care  PD

Really disappointed. . Went there as a playdate / birthday party gathering for our boys. We made reservations started in one room and then every 25 minutes they unloaded the kids and kept going back and forth between the two rooms corralling us into one of the party rooms while a VIP birthday party made their way back and forth when something was said to the manager he said that I was the only one complaining and that if I wanted a refund I would have to leave.  Great business practice we will never be back! The good thing is the boys are too young to know what the heck was going on.

Horrible service... A dinner that should have only been about an hour or so took forever... Servers were very rude... drinks were not maintained... Food took forever... the music was so loud for the dancers and for the in-between time that my husband and I could not even talk to each other...  the live dancers were hmmm so so... and being from Dearborn MI ( the 2nd largest middle eastern community in the world other than the middle east) I think I know Arabic or middle eastern food... the food is nothing to write home about... save your self the time and belly ache and go to haji baba in Tempe  on main... http://www.yelp.com/biz/haji-baba-tempe this place knows Arabic.. In fact the cook is from Michigan

Amazing is the word for this place. . I have looked searched high and low for good/great Thai food here in AZ. . Finally found it here at Thai plates. . I have eaten at this restaurant 5-6 and the service is always exceptional.. my favorite dish is Pra-Ram #33  ohhhhh so good. . Pad Thai is just the way it should be delicious flavorful and lots of it... Spicy basil , ginger delight and spicy asparagus are also really good all veggies are fresh and cooked perfectly. . All this followed up with a cup of hot Jasmine tea.. Perfect!!!! I will be coming to this place for years to come. . I would give them 10 stars if I could. .

Place was beautiful clean with lots of color choices. But the person that did my mini pedi was clearly didn't have experience.  cut my nails down to where the flesh meets the nail and then still tried to file and buff them OUCH! Then took forever to paint my teeny tiny toenails. They looked like a 5 yr old painted em. Then the owner came over to see what was talking forever and took over finishing me up.

Omg good!  Just what I needed after a long week I had the original corn beef w sour krout  on rye.. melt in your mouth. . Just like back home. . And partner had the original w pastrami on rye the steak fries were hot and great. . Also law enforcement and  fire gets a 10% discount. . Thank you guys we really appreciate it. See you tomorrow definitely  if you're visiting phx or from the Midwest to east coast and miss a real deli this is the spot. Enjoy!   Oh and the level of customer service is great. . You don't find that in AZ very often. .
