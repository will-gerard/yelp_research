While I have to admit that I have never been to a physical therapist before, I can not imagine a better experience.  Everything about this place was clean and professional.  Constant encouragement and playful joking around made what could be a slightly grueling experience quite fun.

Fresh ingredients used to make food fast, and always piping hot.  This has been a go-to location for me for years.  It's not your traditional "everything is battered in MSG and fried" kind of Chinese place.  Top items are Kung Pao anything, Pad Thai, and Orange Chicken.  Customer service here is also impeccable.  The owner is seemingly always on the premises and is concerned about the quality of your meal.  In fact, I see the same employees year after year, so I imagine he treats them as well as the customers.

Walking in on a whim for a nice Chinese dinner we were immediately met with the sound of a Chinese zither being played by a young woman.  This only further accentuated the amazing decor that reached from floor to ceiling.  Just amazing.  The service was impeccably attentive, the food was phenomenal and the live zither music perfectly capped off the whole experience.

Don't come here. They are out of everything by 6pm. Staff seemed angry the place was full. Pork chop was cooked enough for a whole pig.
