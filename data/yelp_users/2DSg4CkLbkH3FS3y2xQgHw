I work in the car business selling advertising so I am often hesitant to buy from my own dealers due to a bad experience a couple of years ago. When I decided to buy Tahoe LTZ I talked to several dealers and Power Chevy Arrowhead by far surpassed my expectations. Deb P. in sales, Floyd Brown, one of the Used Car Managers and Larry Smith, The General Manager WENT ABOVE and BEYOND. The process was smooth all they way through finance and they worked until I was happy with both my purchase and the car I was trading in. HIGHLY RECOMMEND and LOVE the Tahoe!

My husband and I got married at the Montelucia April 2, 2011. While I LOVED OUR WEDDING and the hotel did manage to surprise us that day...the stress that the resort caused us before the wedding was not worth it. We started working with the hotel in May 2010 and through the entire process worked with 4 different people in catering....2 of which left the resort and one of which was so awful that we had to ask to work with her supervisor, Tracy Mead. The hotel had lots of turn over and was very unorganized. Planning a wedding is supposed to be a happy time but the Montelucia made the process AWFUL. Once Tracy took over (after 7 months of hell) things seemed to work out a little better. We still had issues with booking guest rooms and an issue with our contract which I do not even want to get into.   Our wedding DAY was amazing and the staff on hand that day went the extra mile to make sure it was. I had a shadow the entire night and she was the best! Our bridal suite was beautiful as well. Tracy Mead did turn things around in the end but I still would not recommend getting married here. While the Montelucia is the most beautiful venue to get married at in Scottsdale in my opinion the internal issues we went through with the hotel were unnecessary and extremely stressful.

I have been here several times for take out. While the food is good they have never gotten our order right. The worst is getting home and realizing they forgot your side of grilled veggies or put tomatoes in everything you asked them not too.   The spicy chicken wrap is bomb...  But nit worth the hassle!

This is by far one of my husbands and my FAVORITE spots.  Living up north off of Cave Creek there are not a lot of options.  Many restaurants have occupied this space all of which we hated.  Amazing lounge area with lots of TVs, free wifi and  great staff.  Matt or Kevin usually wait on us in that area and we now actually consider them friends were there so much!!!  Only bad thing is you can not sit in the lounge area with kids...which is awesome now but will be annoying once we spawn. Gluten free options for me and when we feel like cheating delicious artichoke dip!   Patio was nice in the spring and were looking forward for the cooler weather to sit out there again.  YUMMIE PIZZA, BEER, WINE  AND SALADS and a good spot for watching sports!
