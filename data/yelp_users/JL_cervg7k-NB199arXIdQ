This is as local-business as it gets - this deli has been around for decades. For Phoenix, that's like a millenium. I've been to Cheese and Stuff for lunch about 8 times in the past year, and I've always had a delicious sandwich. They have a huge menu and I'm sure if you want something that's not listed, they'll make it for you. I can't remember the owners' names, but they are always friendly and happy to see you. The dining room does leave a bit to be desired so plan to take your sandwich to go - the only suggestion I'd make for cheese and stuff is perhaps tout yourself as to-go only, lose the tables altogether and make a little more room for unique German gifts and such. Perhaps add a delivery service instead? Okay, now I'm dreaming.  PS in the summer time you can get a fresh squeezed 32 ounce lemonade for a dollar. It is FANTASTIC.  And the iced tea is delicious and always fresh.

Another one of those places that maybe should have remained in childhood. My mother used to make wedding cakes, and many a weekend was spent in the Sacramento version of this store. Mom pouring over decorating tips and sugar crystals, and me pouring over the fun trinketries such as plastic babies, flags of all nations, and sombreros. The store seemed much smaller than I imagined it as a child - yet, I was still able to acquire exactly what I sought: violet frosting coloring gum, and purple metallic sparkles. Mission accomplished. Now on to make a purple i-pod cake. Not sure if they're going to let me use their photo-to-cake topper service to make a Silversun Pickups album cover for my ipod cake though. Bummer.

I really like this Great Clips location because they are very sweet to my 4 and 9 year old daughters. My kids are hands on and inquisitive, and the staff indulge them and answer their questions, no matter how silly.  All of the stylists that I've had for myself and my children have done a great job with all of us.  We're moving out of the area soon but I might consider driving back to this location for haircuts, because it's hard to find a hair salon (especially in Central Phoenix!) that is truly kid friendly.

It is much overpriced, and in my opinion the flavor and texture of the food was similar to what I would expect from any drive thru 'berto establishment. I don't mind that type of food when I'm paying 4 dollars and expecting to throw away a bunch of styrofoam.  But 40 dollars for two people for lunch and one drink each was money that could have been spent buying taco bell and a six pack of bottled margaritas, with money leftover for a tank of gas.  The layout of the establishment is also really weird. (And I'm coming to notice that I have an issue with weirdly laid out restaurants, but I digress.)  You're practically knocking people's food over to get to a table in the back. But this isn't a place you'd want that kind of attention.  This place gets a star for the drink being huge (and for the price, it should be) and giving me a cool buzz on a Saturday afternoon.

I'm not going to turn down a donut if it looks somewhat fresh. But I must tell you, I am not a big fan of the dunkinkreme chains, and store bought doughnuts are just as disappointing. I was happy to stumble upon a local owned small business in Vantastic Donuts - they make doughnuts fresh, the way I remember them from when I was a kid. Getting doughnuts was such a treat, and the local Marie's Donuts in North Highlands, CA (google yelp them!) can not be beat.  But Vantastic is reminiscent. At 8 AM on a Sunday morning they had a wide spread of fresh fried delicacies, including a chocolate cream filled which was my personal favorite. The old fashioned doughnuts were fluffy and iced just right. This is my new doughnut shop, and by the modest crowd in the dining room, I'd venture to say it's been a local favorite for decades.

I was relieved to learn, after moving to Peoria, that the Phoenix libraries only require you to be a Maricopa County Resident, and not specifically a Phoenix resident. I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that my closest branch - Cholla Branch - has a really good selection of children's books, fiction, and rock music. I hesitate to tell you this, because I really want the selection to be there when I go back next time. But really! A library branch with Flying Lotus, Beck, Michelle Shocked, Hooverphonic - I'm impressed. I didn't see much mainstream pop or rap music, and maybe that's the secret, since this branch is not as urban as my prior branch. Perhaps its proximity to Metro Center Mall ensures more teen traffic (and they have a huge teen section upstairs) and thus my alternamom music is more readily available because...well.. they just don't know what's good for them. ;)  The staff is also very friendly at this branch - while the staff at Burton Barr or Acacia were always helpful, it was always with a slight irritation. Cholla seems the best branch of those I've visited so far. Now let's hope that the recession doesn't find this branch closed before I get to check out all the CDs on my wish list.

Thanks Yelpers! Just moved into this neighborhood and decided to give Big Heng a try. The name alone is enough to get me to eat there, because really, who doesn't love a big heng?  My kids devoured the sweet and sour pork. I like that they put the sauce on the side so the tempura pork is still crispy when you get it home. The egg drop soup was quite flavorful. I like the house fried rice - it's probably just soy sauce and rice really, but it sure did taste good. I've been in Phoenix for 6 years and this is only the second Chinese food experience I've had that made me say, "yes, I'd go there again."  The only thing I didn't really like was that the snow peas in the shrimp with snow peas were a bit soggy. But I can live with that knowing that everything else was a hit with the whole family. And the Dinner for 4 served 5 easily with enough leftovers for lunch for 5.

This is the only place in town that starts making my coffee when I walk in, because they know me.  I love that.  It would be better if it were a gym knowing how I like my coffee...   PS these doughnuts are the freshest and most yeasty flavored doughnuts you'll find on the west side.  Say hi to may for me.  :)

I don't go in enough for the morning barista to know my name, but she always phrases it as, "I'm sorry, I should know this, what is your name again?" and I find that charming.  The homemade whipped cream is almost impossible to resist - and if you're going to do that then you might as well have it be resting upon a large Velvet Mocha - one of the best coffee drinks in Phoenix.  I feel like I should bring my Powerbook every time I come here - and I even find myself counting how many non-mac users dare to crack open their cases.  Still, it's a fun little cafe with friendly staff and fabulous hot beverages. Bring an out of town SF or NY hipster who refuses to believe there is ANY culture in Phoenix.

The decor, the people watching, and the sweet potato fries bring me back to Fez time and again.  I want to hire Fez' interior decorator, and their MUSAK selections bring me right back to my days of reckless youth. The prices are decent, as well, and the creative food items stretch the boundaries of "I could have made this at home," which is what I like to find when I go to a restaurant.

After explaining that my four year old daughter loves beading and that this is her reward at the end of the week for excellent behavior, the staff still scowled at me for letting her look through the beads herself.  I'm sure it's tedious, putting all those beads in their little bins and having one fall into another bin is like armageddon, but we really did clean up after ourselves.  After thinking what a shame and making a mental note never to come to this place again, I noticed a 25 cent gumball machine filled with beads on the counter. Five dollars worth of picked out beads, and 25 cents into the gumball machine later, and my daughter was the happiest kid on the planet.  I still won't go back to Bead World, as I expect good customer service even if you hate kids - or at least put an age limit on your door if you don't want little ones in your store - but the gumball machine is a nice touch (that should have been pointed out to me instead of being given the scowl.)

So after my first taste of German cuisine ('cause Weinerschnitzel doesn't count) I emailed my American friend living in Germany to ask if they really have any fruits and vegetables in Germany. Deep fried chicken, three types of sausage, German potato salad... Does red cabbage really count as a vegetable?  I'm not a big fan of sausage but I'm guessing the veal sausage is a little bland compared to what you might be able to find at a German Deli.  The chicken fried chicken was AMAZING and I highly recommend either that dish or the pork chop. I also thought the pretzel was worth coming back for.  I did not brave any German beer, but the house iced tea was fresh.  The wait staff was a bit overattentive, but better that than under attentive, yes?   My American German friend was annoyed that I ate every German Food Stereotype for dinner. But since I'm not going to Germany anytime soon, I guess Haus Murphy's will do. He did confirm, however, that they DO have healthy food and fruits and vegetables there. ;)

The outside facade and awkward parking situation don't do this place justice. Maybe that's a good thing: drivers-by won't be swayed by any fancy paint colors or new-fangled signs (minus the white board announcing Harley's new menu items). Harley's is an upscale establishment, you just have to get inside to get that feeling. I haven't been here for dinner, but escaped work for a long lunch and really wanted to stay through the afternoon. Rich italian pasta dishes and good wine are a winning combination. I went on a Friday afternoon for lunch, and the place was almost empty, which did worry me. I think it may just be a best kept secret, though, because 11 dollars for lunch and a glass of wine combined with an attentive wait staff and an upscale but comfortable atmosphere? That's a secret I'd want to keep, too.

I've been to Qcumberz about a half a dozen times in the past year and while I haven't always walked away with treasures, I've never been disappointed. There is a good mix of old and made-to-look-old, and they really do have their prices in line with the bargain hunter's heart.  They also carry some local artists' home furnishings, which was a fun discovery for me.  Last Christmas, I used pieces of block glass that I found for 7 dollars each to create art as gifts.  They have a large used book selection as well, if you're into that sort of thing.  Like others have mentioned - you probably won't be lured in by the building but once you're in, look at your watch if you're on your lunch hour!!!

I wanted to like Zoe's. I love the logo and the font used on their restaurant marquee. But I just don't get it.  The building space at this location is bizarre, for one thing. Long and awkward and it's like a walk of shame to get to the bathroom if you've come in through the south entrance. The menu is also bizarre insofar as - there wasn't anything on there that I thought, "wow, i really want to try that." It's been several months since I went, so I don't remember what I ended up with, but my friend and I both agreed that whatever we had for lunch was too much to pay, not really what we wanted to eat, and not really comfortable in the atmosphere in which it was presented. Styrofoam serving options bring on the guilt that is generally felt when one eats at McDonald's and throws away more garbage than one consumed.  I haven't been back to Zoe's and I don't think I'm missing much.

The most important thing to me on a Friday night when my dog is shaking and won't move around, and my children are freaking the heck out, is that the staff are compassionate and make my children feel at ease.  This place fit that bill - they told me the "bad news" without the chilren in the room, and the "good news" with the kids there.  That's compassionate care.  (And, by the way, our dog is fine. The bad news was just worse case scenario, and I'm glad my kids didn't hear it!)

Thank you to the Yelpers for helping me find a reliable, quick, and affordable locksmith. I hired a guy a few years ago who took four times as long and charged me three times the price.  Jeff did excellent work and he's got a great sense of humor. I might have to find a reason to have some more locks changed just so I can hire him again.  He was having an off day and showed up late, which according to other yelpers has never happened before, but he was very apologetic and he was grateful that he still had the job. I was happy to be flexible about it because we are humans. Jeff is a hard working guy and I feel much better knowing that my doors will now lock. :) Thanks Jeff!  -- "Emily" (aka Joanna).

called this company due to Yelp reviews after another company scheduled an appointment with me and did not show or call.  Agreed with Chuck on the sticker shock - $195 out the door to change a security lock on a mailbox - but I also know that locksmiths kinda have you by the nether regions in terms of they have the way into the places you obviously can't get into.  So the guy who came was knowledgeable and friendly, but I think he got insulted when I asked about his accent and he said born in Texas. ha. Oh well, I can now get my mail, and I got three copies of the key so I'm *really* an idiot if I need to call the locksmith again.

I don't like pizza dough that tastes like floury saltine crackers. The toppings on my pizza were fresh, but I couldn't get through a whole slice because of the crust. We ordered two pizzas - one thin and one regular crust, and I wasn't a fan of either one.  I can't ever remember which region has what kind of crust: I guess I should avoid Chicago style pizza, unless someone can recommend a Chicago style that doesn't taste like saltines.

I've been a basketer for about three years now. I started in Queen Creek, and I've migrated to sites in Mesa, Phoenix, Glendale, and now Peoria. I think what these ladies have done is amazing. The produce is consistently fresh, of good variety, and an extremely good value. Even when the pickins are sparse, they are still of a very good value. What I like best is that my baskets have gotten me to create dishes or baked goods that I wouldn't have tried otherwise (kiwi bread, anyone?)  There really is no downside to bountiful baskets - even the complaints about getting up early mornings are mute as they have an 11 AM pickup site in Phoenix (and yes I've been there too - I choose that location when I want a guaranteed sleep in morning.)

I've been here about four times, and the first three visits were nothing noteworthy, but today's visit ensures I won't be back. I called to request to come in at 12:30, and they still kept me waiting even knowing I had come on my 30 minute lunch break. And now my eyebrows are uneven, with a bald spot on one side. She said, "oh you have no hair there. you pencil it in." well, I HAD hair there - I don't even own an eyebrow pencil.  Feh. And my eyes and lip are blotchy red, too. I know that's a common occurence, it's just never been this bad for me. Not sure if that's coincidence or not.

The BEST people watching Arizona has to offer. Don't tell me such and such nightclub in Scottsdale is where the action is. Lee Lee has it all: blondes with botox galore, European men speaking Spanish, and Vietnamese fathers humming to the sound of "All the Single Ladies" playing discretely over the intercom.  I wasn't shocked by the contents of the store - anyone who watches the extreme food channel knows that delicacies such as silkie chicken and fish eye soup really do exist. What I was surprised by, however, was that for just a flicker of a moment, if I really stretched my imagination, I felt like I could be in downtown Oakland, perusing the streets, with smells of raw fish and seaweed and botan rice candy permeating my being. In those few minutes that I walked the aisles of Lee Lee on a kidless Sunday afternoon, I yearned for the culturally diverse places where I grew up - the Oriental Market south of the zoo in Land Park seems such a long ago memory. Living in Arizona can sometimes lead you to believe that there's nothing left in this world but dust, palo verde, and an occasional scorpion in your attic. Lee Lee changed all that, if only for a brief moment.  I will be back - likely only out of sheer boredom known as the suburbia of Peoria. But I will be back.

This place always has such a long line during the lunch rush, I figured that must mean something.  It does. It means it takes a long time for them to take your order.  I don't get what all the long lines are about. I love the decor and the uniqueness of a beach fish taco stand in Phoenix, I really do. Especially since it's walking distance from my apartment.  But one fish and one chicken taco later, I didn't get it. They tasted like tacos I could have made at home with tilapia, store bought cheese, and store bought shredded lettuce and tortillas. I was very disappointed. I haven't been back since. I'd be willing to go back to try one of their fruit smoothies which people do rave about, but not for the food by any means.

THIS is how you do pizza! We got a three topping (pepperoni, mushrooms, salami) pizza and a turkey sub, with tip delivered, for 24 bucks. Pretty sure the salami was Boar's Head. The crust COULD be slightly thicker in the middle, but otherwise, almost the perfect pizza.  The sub looked delicious too - though 7.00 for a 10 inch is a little steep, there was a lot of meat and tons of fresh vegetables.  YUM!  We will definitely skip Dominos and go to Nick's for delivered pizza from here on out.

Samples! Samples! Did someone say free samples?  I love popcorn. I still buy a 3 pack of Cracker jacks from time to time. Fiddle Faddle brings me back to sneaking a box in mom's bag when we went to the stock car races on Saturday nights. So maybe I have an unusual love affair with sugar coated popcorn.  Eating a whole 3.00 bag was definitely cheating on someone, I'm not sure who.  But our romance will not soon end. Not with flavors such as cordial chocolate cherry (with real dried cherries), cake batter, and jalapeno cheddar.  The sweet and lovely owner denies that there are any nutritional facts to divulge about the popcorn, but I'm pretty sure that if I ever get caught eating a three dollar bag, I'll be in sugar divorce court.  It would be worth the hassle though. Fresh and sweet popped goodness, cheap.

Noted, Thomas' review was written almost a year ago, when Seconds 2 Go had just opened shop. Since his visit, the shop has changed management and doubled in size. There is a larger housewares section now - and with any thrift store, it's hit or miss. Some days they have tons of furniture. The next day they have none. But take your chances and see if you can find what you're looking for at Seconds 2 Go. Generally their prices are reasonable, and their shoes and clothing are generally stylish and in good condition. Just don't get killed trying to jaywalk over to Maizie's before or after your shopping spree.

From the moment I walk in, I always feel like I belong there. As a person whose hipness faded quite some time ago, if I ever had any at all, that is a good feeling.  I feel like I know the owners and that they're always happy to see me. the heart etched in every sip - while I know it's corny - is worth the extra price for a cup of latte.  Someday I'll have time to sit and chat, but for now, it's a quick stop on the way to a long day at work.

This is the best Mexican food I've ever had in Arizona. The portions are reasonable and so are the prices. The food is fresh and they don't overdo it on sauce and cheese. My kids loved it. Looks sketchy from the street and the decor is outdated but I would definitely come here again.

I didn't go for the Sonoran hot dog (Guero, we need an El Guero Canelo in Phoenix, por favor!!)  But did want to try this place (without reading reviews first.)  It's kind of like a Chipotle meets Fuddruckers.  You tell them how you want your burger/burrito/hot dog, and they bring it to you.  I got the bueno burger - the actual meat is about 1/4 inch thin and they still managed to get it pink in the middle - pretty impressive. The fries were good, and my friend got the onion rings which have a sweet crispy batter.  Not bad. Not fantastic, but not bad.  What is bad though is that we paid 17 dollars for it.  Overpriced by about four or five dollars, in my opinion.  Go here if you're in the area and want a sit down burger (by the way, the barn-meets-industrial decor is odd). But don't go out of your way for it - instead, write a letter to Guero and tell him to start a third El Guero Canelo up here (near Project Challenge in Queen Creek might be a good location to start).

I knew it was going to be a good place when i discovered that they had the softest toilet paper of any restaurant I've ever frequented. I had the shrimp and mango salad. The shrimp was fresh and cooked perfectly. The salad ingredients were also very fresh although not particularly innovative. The dressing was really flavorful (I had the greenmix dressing). The only issue I have is the price. 12.00 for a salad seems steep. But if I paid extra for the Charmin and the clean environment, it was worth the extra couple bucks.

We had the misfortune of arriving just after a man had ordered 15 sandwiches to go.  However, our 20 minute wait was well worth it.  My friends both remarked that their cheesesteaks were the best they'd ever had, and the fries were amazing.  I did try a couple fries and it was difficult to stop at two. I had the grilled chicken salad with cilantro dressing - the only thing remotely healthy on the menu. It's probably offered as an afterthought, but it was still really delicious.  The best part by far though was the owner (there were only two people running the restaurant during our lunchtime visit).  He was very gracious about the orders being behind, and offered us a free meal on our next visit.  We refused it, because we realize he's a new local business and he was busting a$$ to make sure all his customers walked out satisfied.  And we did. Luckily we had an hour to spare, but even if we were late going back to work, I think the excuse-making would have been worth it.  Definitely beats Jersey Mike's for a cheesesteak, and supports local business.  Five stars.

A new sub shop in a dying shopping center...risky move!  But with the nearest Subway a mile northwest of here, this was probably a great location if they can get the word out about their business.   I'd say the shop is comparable to a combination of Subway and Jimmie John's. The bread was fresh and fluffy, and the vegetables were all crispy and generous.  They don't have peppercini peppers but they do have jalapenos.    And, after telling the owner that our dog had passed away earlier today, he gave my daughter three free cookies, which I thought was a sweet touch.  The prices are on par with Subway, and for the money the quality is there. I had the tuna sandwich, and the tuna was quite fresh.  I'm happy that we have a new local sub shop!

I was a yogurt shop princess in the late  80s when serve yourself hadn't been thought of yet.  So many people wanted just 6 ounces of yogurt and I was the yoguNazi, telling them NO!  It's four ounces or eight, people.  No more eyerolling at people who ask for 8 different flavors in one cup though...  Twirl is by far the best yogurt shop in town... now, yogurt is basically yogurt, although a true connoisseur would be able to taste quality brand versus cheaper brand, correct frozen texture, etc etc. Basically ,what I'm an expert at is being able to tell if the people clean the machines at night or not . This place does, it has 10 flavors to choose from, but most importantly, the location is right on target.   People watching, hop a train, get a drink at hula's, and then grab a yogurt and hope it doesn't melt before I get to my dream  loft apartment in the nearby skyscraper condo building.  Ok, I'm kidding, but Twirl is totally cool.  The decor is awesome and the location can't be beat.  So, go twirl it!  Their peanut butter is high class.
