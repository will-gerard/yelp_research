Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my "plastic money" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???    The customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying.   Needless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores...

What great service!    I walked into the store and was immediately greeted.  I was looking for accessories for my ipod 160gb to hook up to my surround sound.  Not knowing what I needed to purchase, I was promptly attended to and the store associate was helpful.  I had no idea that you are able to do so much with the ipod!!  So after getting cables and a docking station...I walked out of there $110 later! But what was great was that I didn't need to wait online to check out.  I was able to check out with the associate!  I love modern technology (when it works )

Went there for lunch today....I was craving a burger when a coworker suggested this place.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  The sliders reminded my of a place that I frequented in Hackensack, NJ called White Mana...The sliders that Chicago Hamburger Co served were delicious.  I am not from the Midwest, but this Jersey girl did enjoy a little taste of Chicago today!

So what is one to do when watching a friends 11 year old daughter on a Friday night? (they were visiting from the UK and I let them have a date night)  I decided to take her to the As You Wish Pottery Painting Place for a creative outlet and some girl time...(Hannah Montana wasn't in town this weekend)  I had passed As You Wish Pottery Painting Place often when going to the yardhouse and to the movies, but have never ventured in...I now know why...This place was FULL of screaming kids having a birthday party in the back and making an absolute mess...But my young friend and I had a blast.  She choose to paint a picture frame and add on cowboy boot for a cost of $18.00 and I choose a Vase that also cost $18.00.  Paint, brushes, studio fee and glazing was all included in the $7.50 for adult. $5.50 for children fee.  (go onto their website and get the 1/2 off fee coupon).  My young friend and I spent about 2 hours painting and chatting (about our favorite Hannah songs).  When we were done painting our pottery, we left it behind for the glazing and firing of our pieces which were to be completed in a few days.    I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised to see how talented we were when I picked up our pieces...they came out great.  So if you are looking for a creative outlet, a fun outing with the kiddies, or an evening alone to listen to screaming children, I would recommend As You Wish Pottery Painting Place.  The staff is friendly and it is a fun and creative way to spend a few hours.

What is going on at Devils Martini North???  It has continually gotten worse over the last year.  The DJ is terrible, the crowd has changed.  I understand they recently lost their food license.  It is not our go to place, but since we are friends with the manager we like to stop in...But I don't think we will be able to anymore.  Devils North has just gotten so bad!

First time to Scottsdale Stadium to watch a spring training game.  (My actual first time at the stadium was in 2006 to see the USA vs South Africa in the World Baseball Classic)  SO MUCH FUN!!  First of all there is nothing better then on a sunny warm day to be outside having a hot dog and beer watching a ball game!  The stadium is a nice venue.  I am not a fan of the SF Giants, but it was fun watching Barry Zito get killed in the first by his former team!!    Can't wait for more games this month!! Here comes the spring!

I am sorry, but all that I have heard about is that I need to try Casa Mia...Casa Mia is the best Italian restaurant in the valley...WRONG!    Come on, its really not that hard to make good authentic Italian food here...in 2 1/2 years I have yet to find an Italian restaurant that I enjoy going back to.  Therefore, I make my own.  I walked in to see that it was a full restaurant..good sign.  The host/owner sat my friends and I down at the last table the restaurant had available.  2 folks were sitting at the small bar.  So I would say that there was at least 20 tables...ONLY ONE WAITER!  This poor guy is running around while the owner and bartender DID NOTHING BUT WATCH.  Already not good.  So it took a little while for the waiter to come to our table, not his fault but the owner could have come and taken our drink order which was a bottle of Chianti .  (The owner I think thought his last name was Soprano)   The food was not good and not worth the price.  I had the calamari in tomato broth...$17 for over cooked calamari in a watered tomato sauce...not good.  Then I opted for the penne with chicken and mushrooms in a pink sauce. How can you mess this one...well it happened.  It lacked flavor, the chicken and mushrooms were overdone and a bit burnt and the gravy had NO taste....So I tried DUMPING parmesan on...that didn't help!  For dessert, this absolutely kills me....my little sister had the cream puffs with chocolate.  Since when are cream puffs supposed to come in a soup of Hershey syrup.  Terrible!  I have no intentions of going back to Casa Mia.  Too expensive for bad food.  And an owner who is just mindless.

My favorite time of year is here!  Baseball Season!  So its no Yankee Stadium...But I have to admit Chase Field is very nice!  Unreal to me that in the second game of the season.....it is not even close to being a sold out game. (not surprising since the playoff games last year against the Rockies weren't sold out!)    We went to the second game of the season in Chase field and sat behind home plate.  For starters, they completely redid the Club Lounge area by I assume removing a few Luxury box suites...but the biggest addition to Chase Field is there brand new state of the art HD screen.  The first in any stadium, the picture is CRYSTAL clear.  So no matter where anyone sits in the stadium they are able to have a great shot of their favorite player (Conner J - please take care of your eyebrows!!!  Your adorable!)   They have also renovated the Clubhouse Box lounge....Bigger bar, more flat screens....  Glad the dome was off last night...It was a great night for a game.  All the best of luck to Doug Davis on Thursday.  My thoughts and prayers are with you....Get better soon!

Well folks...it is a sad, sad day up in North Scottsdale.  Blue Wasabi in DC Ranch has served its last piece of sushi.  They were closed as of Saturday.    FYI: it is rumored that Kevin, the owner, did not want to renew his lease.  Also closing will be San Felipe across the street.

4 words...  BEST PIZZA IN ARIZONA!  Patsy's was my favorite pizza place in NYC and when I moved to Scottsdale two years ago, I was afraid I would never have good pizza until I went back east...Needless to say, I was excited when I found this jewel the day I moved here!!

Dined October 25, 2007 with friends form the UK  I have been anxious to try this Italian eatery since moving to Arizona...Well I must say it wasn't worth going...The restaurant was adorable and it was very busy, however, the food was less then desirable.  We had the calamari fra diavolo as a starter which was tasteful but lacked calamari.  The dish had a lot of tomato, escarole  and garlic but there was a very small portion on calamari.  For dinner I had a favorite of mine, Mr. Pink's Pasta..aka Vodka Rigatoni.  This dish lacked flavor, plain and simple.  I would not get this dish again.  We  decided against dessert after finishing a bottle of Jim Berry "Lodgehill" Shiraz and walked down to the Gelato Spot to complete the Italian evening.  I would only go back to Bada Boom Pasta Room to enjoy there outdoor patio with a cocktail.

Convenient when shopping in Desert Ridge Marketplace, however, the pizza was just AWFUL. There was too much of the cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza (who uses cornmeal on the pizza anyway?) and the slice was cold when they took it out of the oven.  I would not go back for this pizza.

One of my favorite spots here in Scottsdale!  I love their Baba Ganoush, Roasted Red Pepper Humas, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Falafel and of course the Baklava.  This place is is super inexpensive and they give you a lot of food...The only thing is eat fast because the food comes out of the kitchen at lightening speed! So if you order an appetizer wait to order!

Cute little place to go for breakfast on the weekend.  Food was good but I felt it to be a little over priced for a place that does not serve you.    In my opinion, I found Kashman's to be very overpriced for breakfast, and I found it to be the same quality as The Good Egg but way to over priced.

I went on this past weekend for a bit of "Sunday Funday"  and we had a blast!  It was crowded, the band was fantastic, and oh did I mention that 1/2 bottles of wine on Sunday's!  Scott was our server and he took good care of us....The band (I do not have their name) plays every Sunday ...They are a cover band and they are great.  The crowd was eclectic!  It was my first time to The Vig and I am sure I will be back.  Oh and there is a Bocce Ball court (with artificial turf ...not good) Anyone up for a game or two?

I have to be honest, my experience there yesterday was less then desirable.  I was irritated by the way the hostess handled herself.  She is just a nasty individual with zero customer service and the manager was exactly the same.  My friends and I go often and for these 2 women to be nasty to my group is unacceptable!    After the rude and obnoxious behavior from these 2 ladies, I am not sure if we will be heading back to the Vig anytime soon.  Also, from other patrons of the Vig yesterday, they also experienced the same behavior from the 2.  My recomendation to the Vig.....Find yourself a new hostess and Manager.

One of my favorite places to satisfy my sweet tooth!  I typically will get sorbet, and on this evening I decided to get the Raspberry sorbet.  I believe that this Gelato Spot location has the nicest ambiance of all the locations.  After getting my sorbet, I enjoy sitting out on the patio.

I am so excited that baseball season has started!!  Well, not officially, but spring training is giving a little taste of the upcoming season.  I was just at the Phoenix Municipal Stadium to see the LA Dodgers play the Chicago White Soxs.  The stadium was great to watch the ballgame.  We sat behind home plate, the seats were comfortable and the beer was cold...what else do you need on a sunny afternoon?

I have been a member at the Village since it opened in 2005...Wow, it doesn't feel that long ago!  I absolutely love the club!  But I must say I went for a deep tissue massage with Janet this weekend, and it had to be one of the best massages I have ever gotten.  I wish I could go once a week, but that is not in my budget!  If you are looking for an outstanding massage....go to The Village Club at DC Ranch Spa!

Well I did it...I attended my first Nascar Event at the Phoenix International Raceway...and to be honest I did not know what to expect.  This racetrack is literally in the middle of nowhere.  Thousands of trailers lined up to see one of Nascar's last events for the season.  It was quite an experience, folks with no teeth, folks who haven't showered it smelled like in years and folks there just like you and I...normal.  We sat behind and to the right of the guys that wave the flags...second row in the bleachers (I felt as if I were at my HS football game with the stands)  I am greatful  that I brought earplugs because IT WAS LOUD!!  And for 4 hours I got to see cars racing past me at speeds of about 180 mph for 312 laps.    My driver who I was rooting for #99 Carl Edwards came out after about 100 laps because his car broke and I was ready to leave then (mind you, the only reason I was rooting for this driver was that he was half naked on the cover of ESPN Magazine one month...go ahead...google it..you too will be rooting for him!!)  In the end, I was expecting a HUGE finale...but when Jimmie Johnson won and then smoked his tires...It was over.    So my day began when we left at 9:30 am and returned 7:00 pm...Hey, I have been to a nascar event now, our country's most watched "sporting event", I still don't understand the hoopla, and I will probably never go back to an event...well that is of course if Carl and I don't get married! (you have to see that picture!)

DO NOT GO!!  I went in for an oil change and asked them to take a look at my a/c...NOW MY COMPRESSOR IS MAKING AN AWFUL NOISE!!  They are telling me I need a new compressor....for the tune of $1300!    I recommend going someplace else that will not make a problem in order to fix!

How could one not love going into this new burger bar...Open for just seven weeks, business partners Jimmy and Chris, have created a special little place for burger lovers.    Stax Burger Bistro offers only 3oz "slider" burgers with many different options of meats and toppings.  Some choices of "meat" include Beef, Turkey, Ostrich, Lamb,  Buffalo, Salmon and Veggie.  Also what is great with Stax is that for wine folks, they offer ONLY 1/2 bottles.  And these two owners know there wine.  Both came from wine distributing backgrounds before becoming restaurateurs.    We decided to get the "stax sandwiches" (which are all ready pre-fixed as opposed to being a la carte) we choose the Beef, turkey and salmon.  YUMMy!!!  I really loved the turkey and salmon burger because they were so different. These burgers came with 5 different sauces...of course Ketchup, Chipotle mayo, a spicy sauce (my favorite), a pesto and one that slips my mind!  We also choose to get 2 sides...since my friend loves tater tots and I love sweet potato fries, we opted to get these 2...even though the mac and cheese looked good....tater tots and sweet potato fries were exactly what we expected.  There was a tater tot "special" sauce.  Well because of my love for Mac and cheese, Chris went and got me a "taste"...And this is going to be a dish that I definitely will be getting next time I  go to Stax.  So my overall rating for Stax was that it you must go!! And for all the single ladies out there (and coupled ladies that like to look) this place surely didn't lack with some good looking men!  A professional male hangout...you must go and see for yourself!!

I am very disappointed in this place.  I enjoyed going for Happy Hour because it is in the neighborhood, the beer is cold and they had the best salsa and chips around....The food has always been horrible so I never ordered food maybe the occasional fundido dip which is always awful!) WELL, when we got to the bar we noticed that they NO LONGER have the salsa...Instead of making it in the kitchen they have contracted out to some place to make the salsa.  It was terrible.  It tasted like a bland version of marinara.  So disappointing.  So I no longer have a reason to go to Salty's.

I thought that opening night would be packed at the new Canal Restaurant.  This is the first Restaurant to open up at Jennifer Croll's and Fred Unger's concept Southbridge/Mix Shops.  I was wrong...The restaurant was no busy maybe over the course of being there for about two hours they had sat 10 tables.  The lack of patrons was due to a "soft opening".  What is with Scottsdale and all of these "soft openings"?  This is why the majority of restaurants go out of business.    Back to the review:  Walking into Canal, the place had a swanky feel...walking through the bar section to get to the hostess you can see the large white glass wall with pictures constantly changing and you walk past the catwalk...this will be used for fashion shows once the shops are opened.  I sat down to look at the wine menu, and this was done "scrapbook style".  I found this to be a bit tacky.  Apparently, the staff had made this wine book on there own.  It would have been nice for a private restaurant, but for a new swanky restaurant here in Scottsdale, it just looked terrible.  I ordered a Malbec and my friends had the Adult lemonade.  The food menu looked fantastic, I was equally excited to try the food.  My friends and I ordered: Ahi Three Ways, House-made Parmesan fries, Ahi Nicoise; and the Grilled Cheese & Soup.    One word: YUMMY!!!  Everything was fantastic...flavorful, nice portions..Chef Beckett has really done well in his new kitchen. With time this new eatery will only get better...with their patio under construction and the mix shops, Canal will be a great place for food, fun and fashion.

Two words: TACO TUESDAY!  Tecate beer - $2.00 Beef Taco - $1.00 ALL DAY  This place was packed.  Live music started at about 9pm.  I have to be honest...I only had the beef tacos (they were a dollar each!) and a beer...I did sample my friends Margs and they are delicious...each one handmade, no mixes!  And there is a pomegranate tequila you must try.  You have to go on Tuesday night!

This place is great for breakfast.  Always consistent food, friendly wait staff and always a line.  Fresh squeezed OJ, good pancakes and don't forget about the egg!  You can get your eggs just about anyway you want.  For a fast inexpensive option for breakfast, I go to the Good Egg.  With multiple locations throughout the valley I am sure that there is a Good Egg near you.

"A Beauty Apothecary": Luxury Cosmetics, Skin Care, Bath + Body, Makeup Services, Brows, Eyelash extensions...  I ventured into this tiny Beauty Apothecary some time ago, and fell in love with this small boutique.  It is a one of a kind here in Scottsdale and carries lines such as Kevin Aucoin...I like going there because I have finally found a GREAT aesthetician...her name is Leah Alvarez and I highly recommend her for any waxing services (especially the brow!) she also provides facials and other services.   The Glam Lounge as provides makeup services buy Andrea...she is genius when doing makeup!  I highly recommend this Beauty Apothecary boutique for any of the ladies out there!

I must say that I have been excited to go to Roka months ago when i learned that it was coming to Scottsdale.  I have friends in London that really like the place...So I finally had the opportunity to go to  Roka Akor last night... I walked in and it is beautifully decorated.  The smell from the Robatayaki grill,was a bit strong (yes, I am suffering from allergies) but I manage and find the place quite enjoyable.  The bartender gave us tastings of the fresh sochu  infused cocktails...Lime, pineapple, raspberry and honeycomb.  Honey comb was my favorite!    What I liked was the small plates enough to share and to give you a taste of the food.....But I must say a little disappointed with the food.  Maybe I had too high of an expectation.    Here is what we had:  - Lobster and Abalone dumplings - good, but i found the Abalone to be a bit chewy. - Calamari- tasty but a bit over fried...didn't get the flavor of the squid.   - Robata grilled eggplant - DELICIOUS!!  - Tuna Tartar - SO good I loved the raw quail egg and caviar and how they made me mix it together. One tiny cracker accompanied the dish. A bit overpowering with the mustard...and it took 30+minutes to come to the table  - Soft Shell Crab roll - okay, I liked that they used Kimchi in the roll, and it didn't overpower the roll. - Black Cod - this was yummy, but there is a place down the street that i find there black cod to be a bit better.  I did like the presentation!  I am not sure if I am being hard on Roka Akor, maybe I was just so excited to get there and reading everyones reviews...I know that I will be going back.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and I would like to visit on the weekend and try some more food and have a sochu!

Easter Brunch I spent on the patio of Ristorante Tuscany @ JW Marriott Desert Ridge.  They of course did not have there traditional menu, but a prix fixe menu for the brunch since they are not typically open on Sundays.    Sitting on the patio over looking a large water feature with lush greens and beautiful blue skies, almost made one feel as if they were not in a desert.  Claudio and Juleen were taking care of us this day and I have to say...they were fantastic!!  Personal and friendly, they never let the Proseco stop flowing!!    The meal began with a buffet of Antipasto...so many different cheeses, salami's, prosciutto, figs, grilled vegetables, salad with dates (it was like I was home having Easter dinner at my Mom's).  I choose the salmon appetizer off the menu as well as the crab cake benedict (Claudio also  brought a piece of the lobster and caviar strata for the table to share)  The Salmon was done perfectly with a little dijon sauce it was enjoyable.  I tried my friends flat bread with mushrooms and this was also delicious.  It was amazing that it was an appetizer as  it was a whole rectangular pizza.  The crab cake benedict was a bit salty for my tasting.  However the lobster and caviar strata was fantastic!  I also tried the Kobe beef and mushrooms...delicious.  And the Proseco was still flowing.  Desert was served in the wine cellar.  And of course I had to try a little of everything!    What I did truly enjoy was that this was a slow dining experience.  They did not rush you and actually let the food digest before another course was presented.  A beautiful setting.  Fantastic people taking care of you. And of course delicious food.  What other better way to spend a Sunday for brunch.

Loved it.  Just what I was looking for!  I enjoy a simple frozen yogurt with minimal calories and golden spoon is the ticket.  I am quite simple, I like a vanilla and chocolate swirl / side by side and I will occasionally add some rainbow sprinkles...This place is at least healthy!  And since it is frozen yogurt, after my hike with the pup on Sunday I treated her to a vanilla mini....she loved it too!

North Scottsdale doesn't have a large selection of breakfast places....so i have to travel down to "the city".  I am glad that I did.  Over Easy is Aaron May's 2nd restaurant here in the Valley...some of you may know his first in DC Ranch...Sol y Sombra.    You know the place is good, when it is packed and folks are waiting in the pouring rain for a seat!  The restaurant is not very big with half of the tables outdoors...under a tent with heaters (nice touch)  The food is great nice size portions and inexpensive!!  Coffee and fresh squeezed OJ completed this meal.  I recommend going, even if it is a ride from north Scottsdale.  It was well worth it.

A Jersey girl in a cowboy bar...One would never think.  However, this Jersey girl checked out the newest restaurant/nightlife addition to Old Town Scottsdale...Saddle Ranch Chop House.  And I have 2 words...LOVED IT!    This restaurant/bar first garnered attention in Hollywood.    I didn't have the opportunity to eat there, but I did enjoy a frothy beverage!  The patio is big...and the selling point is a mechanical bull!!  Great western bar, fun atmosphere and a bull!  I will update my review once I eat there.  But you must go!!  **UPDATE***   GO ON SUNDAY BRUNCH!!!  $1.99 Mimosa and Bloody Mary's....The food is good too!

** Update 4/12/08**  The reason I moved my star rating down to 2 is because the food is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!! And I left it at a 2 rating because the bar is actually nice for cocktails ONLY!  I took my friends there for some beers and food and thought it would be fun because they are in town from England....Since when are fish and chips that are supposed to be "beer battered" cooked with Italian bread crumbs?????  The chips where regular french fries!, not wedges.  The macaroni and cheese was also terrible!  The patio is dog friendly, so if I go back, I absolutely will never order food there!    Attention folks that live in  McDowell Mountain Ranch and DC Ranch...  We finally have a sports pub!!! Temple Bar Sports Grill opened on Friday January 18.  I only had a chance to grab a quick cocktail...but the Temple Bar Sports Grill looks like and has the feel of my new favorite neighborhood pub!  Huge Patio with a soon to be installed fire pit....  Here is what they had to say about themselves, and I must agree! (I have not tried the food yet):  "What do you want to do tonight?" That question has finally been answered with the opening of Temple Bar Sports Grill - the newest neighborhood sports lounge in North Scottsdale that has an upscale atmosphere with a laid-back attitude.  We have delicious food, friendly staff, a full bar with 12 beers on tap, 23 HDTV's, and late-night music and dancing on weekends - all with a little Irish flair.  Whether the question is "Where do you want to eat for lunch?", "What's for dinner?", "Where should we meet for drinks?", or "Where should we watch the game?" - Temple Bar is the answer. Come hang out with us for lunch, dinner, or happy hour, meet friends and make new ones, or watch the big game on one of our TVs.

I have found my new favorite lounge here in Scottsdale...and I don't have to drive down to Old Town!! Stone Rose is the innovative creation of the Gerber Group.  by infusing Scottsdale's nightlife with cutting-edge design, signature cocktails, and a dash of glamour - all within a unique indoor/outdoor setting.  A large outdoor bar is surrounded by couches and fire pits and beautifully landscaped.  The indoor portion of the bar/lounge has wooden floors and ceilings with black leather couches...making for a retro 1950's feel.  Stone Rose is absolutely beautiful within the Fairmont Princess grounds.  With another NYC lounge opening here in Scottsdale, I am beginning to feel more at home here in the desert!  For all you folks that live here in North Scottsdale, we finally have a posh/laid back lounge!

Very disappointed...I had my usual Dirty martini, but a friend wanted just a soda since she was driving....Do you know what they charged...$4.00!!  For a soda!  And it was in the smallest glass!  Come on....With DUI laws that we have here in Scottsdale and the economy crisis that we are in,  $4.00 for a soda is a bit much when it is cheaper at Target to get a case!  ($3.50) I am not cheap by any stretch, but I think it is a bit absurd to over inflate the price of a soda!  Don't go to Stone Rose if you are looking for a drink deal!

Took a friend to go and check out one of Scottsdale's newest spots, Geisha a Go Go which just opened on Saturday.  We walked in and were greeted by a Kaitlyn a Bubbly hostess...she introduced us to one of the doorman (who was off of work) and 2 bartenders Logan and Ray.  Again very nice, friendly and Talkative...The place is small.  But nicely decorated.  A large rock is in the middle of the bar area, very Feng Shui, but I wonder what knuckle head is going to try and "climb" it in a drunken stupor. But I couldn't understand why there were 3 very large pictures of Jimi Hendricks, Jim Morrison and Sid Vicious...great rockers, but why?  Two died of a heroine overdose and the other committed suicide.     The Karaoke rooms which they have been advertising to rent out by the hour for $50-$100 are very very small with a HUGE tv.  (remember when you were a kid and your mom told you not to sit too close to the tv or you will go blind?!  That is what will be in the back of your mind when you are in the room)  Lets talk food...I have to say, this was NOT one of my new favorites.  First off, Logan made us a "Hello Kitty" cocktail....very fruity, whicj i am not a fan of, but i slowly enjoyed the strawberry martini cocktail. We started with there rock shrimp and soft shell crab small plates.  These items were okay, but too much cilantro on the rock shrimp...We then ordered the grilled lobster spring rolls and tuna/blue crab tartare.  Terrible!  I did not like these items.  Why does everything include cilantro???  I hate cilantro.  I wasn't at a Mexican restaurant.  The spring roills were chewy and more veggies the lobster and the tartare, I had trouble tasting this.  I felt it to be WAY TO fishy!  That to me was scary because tuna does not have a fishy smell...well it would if it was old!!  So that scared me, oh and the seaweed salad atop the tuna was very very salty...  Geisha a Go Go also mentioned that they will be redoing the patio in front to offer outdoor dinning.  This will be completed in the middle of March.  The only reason I would go back would be for a cocktail...I would not recommend the place to dine.

I have not dined at the Estate House, but I did sit at the bar in their lounge upstairs from the fine dining restaurant.  I have to say that this place is beautiful.  Dark wood lounge with pianist and I felt I was back in NYC.  They have a outdoor patio in both the front and back of the lounge.  The place has been beautifully decorated.  At the bar, the bartenders are very very nice and helpful....Melanie is great!  She is helpful and very knowledgeable about the drink menu, as well as the other bartenders.   The cocktail menu is extensive with different types of liquors not seen here in Scottsdale.  I was able to meet the beverage manager, Bill,  who also is the manager at Canal and FoodBar who was the genius behind these delicious concoctions!  I started with the Lychee Martini that had blue cheese stuffed figs...I know weird right...but DELICIOUS!!!  This cocktail had fig infused liquor...just very yummy!  My friend had a cocktail with one of my favorite liquors called St. Germine Eldelflower (I actually like this with Champagne)...it also very very yummy!!!    We had a few noshes...The cheese platter which was nice, it was small and I feel that it did not vary on their selection of cheeses.  We had the mussels and the tuna tartare.  Mussels were great and the tartara was in fact very good, but it had a lot of big pieces of raw onion (not a fan of raw onion) but it was great.   Then for "dessert" I had their Banana Foster cocktail....They muddle caramelized bananas for the drink...This was like drinking heaven. My friend had the Tuscan Sidecar...not a bourbon fan myself, the drink was very tasty.  What amazed me about the bar was there large selection of unique liquors and how many different garnishes they had for the drinks.  I would recommend this lounge for a night cap or to just sit in the large couches and relax to the sound of the piano.  **Update** Went on another night to try yet another martini...So I had the Pear martini.  Again, Delicious!!  Not sweet.  Very fresh!!  And it was nice out so we sat on the outdoor patio.  So beautiful!

What a great hike!  6 miles round trip through the wash of the McDowell Mountains.  What a beautiful time of year to be out there..with a rainy winter, the mountains are green as well as the landscape and wildflowers are blooming.  Hike to Talliesin Ridge for a great view of the valley.

I walk in for a volleyball and I walk out with a few golf clubs, a basketball and tennis balls!  Sports Chalet has everything and anything a sports nut would need and want!  I love walking around the store and seeing what I could possibly play with.  I have made a number of purchases at the Sports Chalet in the past and I continue to go back.  Yes the staff isn't always the most knowledgeable, this could be that most are in high school, but you can get everything!  What I also think is fantastic is that they offer Scuba instruction...and they have there very own pool in the back!

Went to Cafe Bink for lunch on Saturday, and it was one of the best lunches I have had in a long time!  We had a bottle of chanpagne and a sandwich each.  My friend had the White cheddar grilled cheese and I had the Corned Beef sandwich.  His grilled cheese was full of flavor and I cannot tell you how great my corned beef was....We also had the french fries which have to be the best french fries I have ever had!  They are cooked 3 times before arriving at your table and served with three dipping sauces.  With our lunch we split a bottle of Baumard which was perfect with both sandwiches.  Also, the service was great.  Highly recommend Cafe Bink!

2 words - Not impressed!  It has been three years on my quest to find great Italian food here in the valley.  Being Italian and from North New Jersey it has been quite a challenge.  So you could imagine the excitement when 2 of my very dear friends have been raving about the Amarone....stating the best Italian restaurant they have found in AZ.  I was extremely disappointed.   As I walked in i quickly noticed how beautifully decorated the restaurant was.  We sat at the bar.  The place was packed, so I quickly thought my friends must be right.  This place must be a gem.  Bartender was nice...didn't go out of his way.  The menu was a bit expensive.   $3.50 for a coke!!!  That is a bit much!  My friend got pizza ($18) and I penne alla vodka ($15).  I had to ask for extra sauce as the pasta was VERY dry.  And to be honest....possibly one of the worst dishes of penne vodka I have had.  No flavor!  And the pizza was ok, BUT for $18 I was expecting fantastic.    2 of the waiters came over to talk with us and I felt them to be a bit creepy.  I think they just came back from a cigarette break, but I thin they were smoking something other then a cigarette.    Not one of my favorite.  What I have learned is that if I want great Italian food....I am just going to have to continue making myself!

SUPER FUN!!!  It was my second time going to this small divey type bar...and I really love it!   I went with 6 friends to watch the Cardinal game on Saturday.  This place is laid back and adorable as it feels that you have just spent the day skiing in Aspen and now it is time to enjoy a cocktail or 2 with friends.  Very inexpensive, yummy food, great large TVs, pool table couches and yes even a faux fireplace!  I love the antler chandeliers and the moose head over the front door.  Ask for Casey....he is a great waiter and will take care of you!

I was there last night for a private Christmas Party of a friend of mine and it was my first time at the restaurant.  I have to say, I am so looking forward to going back!  The food was amazing!  I had the French Onion Soup and the pan roasted free range chicken breast.  So delicious!!!  And then for dessert was this amazing peanut butter torte....The band that was playing was great.  I wish this wan't so far from my home as I would make it a regular spot!

I had to remove my thoughts on Cream.  If you are interested in why I am disgusted with this place and will never go back you can email me.

Do you hate shaving as much as I do? Do you find waxing too painful and expensive every 6-8 weeks?  Well I have the answer for you!!!  Go see Cindy Semerdjian at Cosmetic Laser Solutions.  I was introduced to Cindy through a friend AND NOW I AM HOOKED!!!   Not only do I no longer have hair, it is very inexpensive!  How much did it cost for you to get waxed...what would you say if I told you for a few dollars more the hair would be gone...PERMANENTLY!     Cindy offers a free initial consultation.  A few prices that I have experienced on a per session basis is: underarm - $100 ; bikini (brazilian) - $100; full leg (both) - $250.  I highly, highly recommend going to see Cindy!  Tell her Jillian sent you!      So get started today to get ready for summer!

Decorated nicely, food not as nice.  Went in for some snacks, walked out very disappointed.  We sat at the bar were the bartenders are not informed.  They were not helpful.  I understand that the bar just opened, but don't you try the chef's food?  We had the tuna and eggplant which surprisingly was tasty....The grilled cheese was AWEFUL.  No flavor, and just too much bread.  And how do you run out of sweet potato fries?  Seriously, you are a burger place.....

So I walked in with 10 of my friends thinking that this would be the place to go on a Friday night in more of the "North Scottsdale" area.  We went a little early because we were already out at a spot for Happy Hour and we decided to go visit the new place in town.  The place is nicely decorated with wooden floors and leather couches.  I have a friend that even took advantage of your stripper pole.  I have to say that everyone who worked at the place is great.  Super nice folks. Shawn the owner/gm is great.  Very nice and generous.  And it also helps that he is a Jersey boy!    Katie was our waitress, also super nice!  The ONLY issue I had with this bar/club/lounge was the DJ.  The music was terrible.  After multiple requests for some music, he still had not changed it up.  Not a lot of people were dancing....and I have to say that when we left at 12:30, on a weekend grand-opening, this place should have been PACKED and unfortunately it was not.   Angels & Outlaws you have a huge obstacle to overcome. I am pulling for you, but  I think that the shopping center is not a good location for a club/bar as many have shut down before you and it is important to have good music.  I like the idea of every bottle is only $125 for service, there is no drink over the price of $8 and that you have great people that work for you.  So I am asking, please get a better DJ!

YEAH!!!!  Dunkin Donuts has finally opened in my neighborhood!  It is in the same shopping center as Walmart (not a fan)...Donuts are so yummy!  Do I really need to  write a review? Opened on June 24 (my birthday) it was the priority of the day to go and get an iced coffee and donut!  Jason the owner is super nice.  Go in and get your donut and coffee!!
