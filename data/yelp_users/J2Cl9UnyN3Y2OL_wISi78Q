Yelp, you failed me on this one. I stopped by for a couple bagel sandwiches and all of them were just mediocre. I thought the sandwiches were pretty thick which made it difficult to eat; also i didn't think the ingredients were very fresh; finally, i felt sick after I ate one sandwich and my family did too. Maybe I should have just gotten plain bagels? Don't think I'll be back.

I didn't get the true incline experience today because of the weather. It was snowing and foggy out, so the beautiful view was hidden.   However, the other riders were very friendly. It was cool being in an old trolley and knowing its historical background. Once you get to the top, you can check out the view from different angles at the restaurants nearby.

TRY THE CHIPOTLE POLKA (But it's huge so share with someone... or dont).   We came here for some food after a night out and it was cool. The food wasn't healthy and didn't necessarily taste like super great quality. But it hit the spot and the leftovers were great for breakfast the next day. We also ordered some goat cheese pizza dish, wasnt a huge fan of that one. They also had a promotion going with DASH, so our meal was basically $0  (not including tip obviously).

This was my first taste of Pittsburgh, and it was pretty delicious!   We ordered the Tex Mex Omelette and it super flavorful. I was expecting a little more of a spicy kick to it, but I'm glad it wasn't very spicy. We also ordered the special of the day hotcakes (filled with apples, walnuts, and other stuff- sorry yelpers, I dont remember!). It was my first hotcakes experience, and I was impressed. It basically tasted like apple pie inside of a crepe. The portion sizes are pretty large... we didn't end up finishing all our food. I'd definitely recommend sharing. If I had to only pick one item, I'd definitely pick the Tex Mex again (but I'm more of a savory kind of gal!).   We arrived a little after noon and we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait. We only waited about 20 minutes for a table- score! The service once we were seated felt a little bit rushed, but they were nice enough and didnt mess up our order.   Next time I'm in town, I'd visit again!

My parents and I visited Lustre for happy hour and it was great! The white sangria was so yum! And waitress, Vanessa, was so sweet and attentive. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll be back.

This is one of my favorite brunch chains! I tried it out in Denver and LOVED it and was so pleasantly surprised they had a location in PHX (now just make your way east towards CHI, snooze! ;)).   EVERY SINGLE FOOD ITEM AND DRINK ITEM WE ORDERED WAS DELISH. My only complaint was the people next to me got something on the house for literally no reason. lol.
