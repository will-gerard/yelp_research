Rustlers rooste pork ribs are absolutely amazing.   I get those every single time.  If you go, you must get the cow pie.  Absolutely delicious.   Rustlers rooste is very family friendly. There is a huge slide for the kids enjoyment.  There is also baloonatics and magicians that go around to your table and entertain you.   It's extremely fun and I highly recommend this to anyone.

It was a busy night. Therefore it is obvious that service and food may take a little longer than usual.   I don't mind having a busy server as long as they have a good attitude.  Out server was great. He was not the problem. Our wings came out extremely dry and crunchy, it is obvious that it was thrown into the frier a couple times. The wings were so dry and and crunchy they were clearly old wings.  The fries came out a while after the wings and we're dark brown. Clearly those were refried a couple times and they tasted awful.   This has been about the third time I've come and each time the wings come out tasting very old. I will not be coming back and would not recommend this location.  Food is awful.  Except for the Wong tong chicken tacos. Those are the bomb. Also, I had a Pina colada and the drink was extremely watered down.  The drink tasted more watery than it should've been.  Could have been due to the fact that the server was busy and it may have been sitting at the bar for 15 minutes.  It came out shortly before dinner was out.

I have been a regular since 2013.  I always get the same thing with my boyfriend and the servers always accommodate our requests.  Servers are always so friendly.  I have never had a bad experience here and if there was ever a mistake made, they were so quick to fix it.  I love it here and  recommend it to everyone who asks about where to get pizza. I always get the big Kahuna with wings and it never disappoints me.  It's my favorite pizza place.    I highly recommend it!
