Great Starbucks for you early birds opens at 4:30am. If you are waiting in the drive-thru they will even open a little early for you.

What a great fast food burger. I had the Arizona.  Little more pricey than you'd think but the shakes here are delicious. Never understood why they give you the giant extra metal cup with the rest of your shake in it, when they could just give you your shake in bigger glass. Either way I'll be back.

Love this place! The wings are crispy and huge. You got to try the Cajun hot if you like spicy wings and the seasoned are really good too. Tried the catfish sandwich on this trip was surprised that it came on regular sliced bread. It didn't matter though the catfish itself was cooked perfect. I bought a bottle of the Cajun hot sauce and threw it on there...so good.

My new favorite breakfast spot.  The breakfast burrito crepe is a must, their iced coffee are really good and the hipsters are nice. no phone orders only down side as it's pretty busy every time I've gone.

I have to agree with most yelpers on this one the food is poor the beer is good. However the service was great. My friend ordered the flat bread pizza and when it came out it was a cheese pizza with a salad on top (not appealing at all). When the waitress came to ask how everything was he complained and she said that she would comp the pizza and get him the southwest pizza and comped that one too. So they are trying but I think they just need a new menu or a new cook.  I would go back for the beer.
