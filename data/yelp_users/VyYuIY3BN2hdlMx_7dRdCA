Super disappointed in the phone mannerism of the staff. Can you say "no thanks." The story:  I found myself in Phoenix, AZ with two bald tires and I really needed to get new ones. The person on the phone was a JERK. He didn't listen even though I told him that I had the tire size off of my tire. He said, "It may not be the right size, just tell me what car you have you probably don't know what numbers I need." Why? Because I have a va-jay jay? Really!  He also said that the last person could have used the wrong size... really? I also bought those at a Firestone in San Diego, CA. Nice... talk bad about the people in your network.. makes sense.  So, I went to a different store where they were awesome. The reviews on this site are spot on for this location. Maybe Firestone should take note that the person answering their phone is an IDIOT and do better.

We needed someone to clean the stairs in a condo. The technician was on-time and super polite. The work turned out perfect.   I highly recommend if you are looking for a company in Glendale, AZ!
