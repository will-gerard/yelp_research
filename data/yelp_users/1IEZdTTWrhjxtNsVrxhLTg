My girlfriend and I have eaten here about a dozen times in the last 6 months or so. Being fans of both italian and greek foods, I try to eat something different every time. So far, I haven't had anything that was less than delicious... Service is great, and the customers are usually loaded with character, too... Two thumbs up, for sure...

Been coming in here a couple times a week for the last six months or so. It's close to my house, and they have a fair selection...The gentleman I usually dealt with in there was a pretty nice guy. A few days ago, i went in, and the guy working was less than friendly. I'm okay with that, as I don't really go there to make friends.Today, rode my bike through the drive-thru about 3pm. Same guy working there, and he was just a complete jerk. Not just to me, but to the car in front of me, too. I love to support the small shops, but this is one I won't be supporting anymore... Too bad...

Best sushi in town, hands down... The baked lobster roll, and heart attack roll are both incredible...

My wife booked us a half-day kayaking trip at Canyon Lake for my birthday. Went out this morning, and were met by our guide, John. After a brief lesson, we were paddling across the lake. Neither of us had been in a kayak before, and we had a blast. John was friendly, and fun, and full of information. Thanks, John, for a great morning!  Dane and Jenn

Fantastic place to see a movie... The theater was comfortable, and nice. The food was great... This is what all movie theater should be...
