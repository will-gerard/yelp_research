I love this venue. I can see someone get mad about this place if they see a rock band and the stage keeps turning away from them, but I've been to two rap shows  (Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lemar) and its great to have the artist move around the set and everybody from all corners of the venue receive an equally great view and experience.  Private parking is a plus, keeps out scalpers and ensures your car gets some level of security. Wish the ticket doubled as a parking pass though.  Bathrooms are the biggest negative here. I've seen closets with more space to move in and out. We are packed like sardines in there.  Sound system was good, no complaints from the back section where I stood.  Overall, one of the better medium sized venues out here in Arizona to see your favorite artist up close before they book stadiums like US Airways and you have to see them on stage from a 100 yards away.

cool place. really is more of a grocery that happens to serve italian food. portions are good and the price is right. i worry that I might lean from my chair and tip over stuff on the shelves but other than that it's fun looking place.

The Sweet potato roll is a hidden gem.

Sushi variety is basic traditional stuff, and the quality isn't close to what you find at a Kabuki. But hey, I got to pick and choose anything I want and only spent little over $12, so not a big deal.

I've been here too many times that I feel that the only reason I will manage to obtain my degree was thanks to Dutch Bros. Bless this place.

Never was told or saw a sign about the $50/per person (i thought it was 35), so it was a nice sticker shock at the end of this experience. Probably will go here once every blue moon unless someone has a big announcement and wants to celebrate, but it's nice to try it just once. Come here hungry as if you want to eat a horse, because that's exactly what is going down in here.  - the salad bar deserves an A+ . - all you can (eat/handle) banana fritters. Lord.....A+

This place always has a Michael Jackson playlist going on as you do your groceries and that makes all the difference for me to choose this place over every other oriental supermarket

Terrible experience on a Tuesday night. We arrived for dinner and stood around not knowing whether to wait to be seated or sit at any table (we did the latter).  Started off by ordering Mango Lassi and it was below average quality. More watery and thin instead of being creamy and possibly not considered "fresh" as the menu description says.  and the food took forever! my god, we finished ordering by 6:30 and finally received our orders at 7:20. over 45 minutes. the venue was only at 20% capacity with 4 tables of customers and a guy waiting for a to-go order he ordered beforehand, so it's problematic to think this restaurant would be able to handle a full house or a few large groups if it couldn't handle a slow night.  and when we finally received our food, we can instantly tell that we've seen better Indian food at other places. The food was not "fresh off the kitchen" as our 3 dishes were already cooled down to just warm and began to be cold before we even finished. The portions were small for the price and the ingredients used were sub-grade. (we could tell that the shrimp was frozen and didn't mix all the way with the sauce)  add the fact that we waited this long for our order and not feel satisfied by it is disheartening as you receive the bill.  Disappointing experience because this is the only Indian restaurant in the area of the West Valley (Goodyear, Avondale, etc.) before the next ones in Glendale and Phoenix. I suggest to skip convenience if you're eating with a group and make the drive to the better ones located in Phoenix.

i was here for the Earl Sweatshirt concert. This venue is terrible for anything really, and is desperate for renovation.  Wasn't a sold out crowd but it was a struggle to get a good view because of the terrible placement of the main bar being in the middle which then leads to too much space being given to the lounge.  and there is this large ass production booth in the very middle that should be placed in the very back.   So that leaves us with only half of the venue and a triangle spaced floor near the entrance to actually see the event we paid for. At a show that wasn't sold out.   This could be zero stars really, but that 1-star was because they do book good artists consistently every month.   p.s. they need to install some speakers in the back at least, we want to feel and act just as buckwild as the people in the front too you know.

No MSG is always a plus. And this is one of the better bun bo hue that's as good as homemade. But they go cheap on everything. Little bit of veggies, super thin slice of lime, and one napkin. And when you ask for another napkin they give you ONE extra sheet. Thanks I guess haha. Prices are good though, you won't pay more than $7 for a bowl.

A good personal pizza with quality ingredients, and I think its cool to see the process of your pizza being made right there like its a Subway.  $8 feels expensive but in comparison to other places down College Ave. it seems fair.  I hear the cookies are pretty good too.  - I wish i can give an extra half star for the great music being played there as you wait for your order.
