The Melting Pot did not disappoint during AZ restaurant week! Started off with the spinach artichoke cheese fondue, my husband had the Caesar salad while I had the California salad...so good! The main entry with an assortment of meats, ravioli, veggies and shrimp was great as always. We were both stuffed for dessert but tried the flaming turtle! Yum yum! They also offer a glass of wine for each of us as a part of the deal. Very worth it! Thanks Mike, Sean and Victor for the great service!

Go. Now. Perfect patio, even in the summer with fans and misters we were very comfortable. Wait staff was on point. Happy hour deals were a steal. We had a variety of drinks, all outstanding. My favorite was the mojito. We ordered the guac, pork wings, flat bread and fish tacos. Yep a ton of food and ate it all. Order the pork wings and make sure you have a fork full of the pickled carrots and onion with each amazing bite. It will change your life.

Don't bother coming here. Scottsdale has so many other great places to eat. The patio was cute, but the misters were not turned on which became very uncomfortable for a hot Arizona summer night...inside seating is available. The one star was for our service and food quality. Our server forgot to put my order in and got my friends order wrong. Rarely checked in and had to call her over a few times. It was not very busy in her section, so no reason for her to be unattentive. Expensive and not that great. A MEH experience at best for a $70 tab.

Not sure why the rave reviews on food. The service and beers are good, but food is Meh at best. I have the pulled pork sandwich and potato soup. My husband got a burger which he said wad pretty good but not great. Portions were measly in comparison to the $50 we paid. If you want an decent atmosphere and just plan on drinking, this is an ok spot. There are so many great places to eat in the valley, we will not be back.

Love this salon! Modern interior and excellent range of services available. Janelle is amazing. She can work with all hair types and styles. She has taken me from dark to blonde, from long to short and happy every time. I love the lemonade and pretzels too!

Meh. There are so many other better bars in Tempe so I am not sure I would be back.  Went for a Wednesday night happy hour for cheap drinks and food.  Had 2 Devilritas, pretty tasty for $3 each. Husband had 2 beers at a good price.  The environment was nice and waitress friendly & attentive, but the food was not that great. Ordered the $6 buffalo pizza. Sauce was way to peppery and hot for my liking. Chicken rolls ok, but really heavy. Chips and dip trio also just ok.  I'm glad we only spent $31 for all of that food. Maybe the food reviews on here are good because everything tastes better when you are intoxicated.

Called ahead today and got an 8am appt for an oil change. Only took 20 min and they took care of the tire pressure as well as filled my spare. Friendly and knowledgeable. You guys have earned my business. Thanks!

First time and last time here. We went for happy hour but didn't know we had to tell the hostess we want to sit in the happy hour section. Waited twice for a table. Pretzel bites were great and a good value. Antipasta plate did not have much on it for the $8 spent. I had the mule. Very disappointing since we had just left Bitter & Twisted and had amazing cocktails there, only to come here for a sugary pre made drink mix. With so many great places to go downtown, we won't be back.

My first experience here was a win. Mary is unbelievably meticulous in her attention to detail. I have very weak nails. She took her time applying the gel and inspected each coat. She made sure each nail was completely sealed and promised if my nails weren't any stronger next time, we would try another way to get them looking great. The $30 pedicure was fantastic as well. The services are not overpriced for what you get.  The shop is nicely decorated and extremely clean. The shop owners were very friendly, making sure everyone had a cold bottle of water and their customers were happy. My only recommendation would be to lose the tired tunes and go for some spa type music with maybe add a small fountain to add to the spa like feel. It's a great location in Tempe. I will for sure to be back and see my new friend Mary for another mani pedi.

Just finished a 90 min couples massage. I had Timothy and husband had the owner Marie. When we walked in we were greeted by Marie, offiering cold water infused with our choice of doterra essential oils flavors. Yes they are consumable and delicious! Lovely room and both therapists were very professional and friendly. Timothy has 18 years experience under his belt so I was comfortable with him working out some old back injuries. We could not have been any more pleased with our experience. Timothy used a variety of techniques, pressure was perfect. My husband really enjoyed his massage as well. Jim and I will try to go back monthly for a much needed tune up. Skip the chain massage places and support a wonderful and locally owned business! Thanks Marie and Timothy for a great start to our Sunday!

Great service, cheap food and big portions. I'm a Jersey girl I and the breakfasts here are just as amazing as they are back home. Had the chicken fajitas and scrambled egg skillet with a tortilla instead of toast! Sooooo good. My only complaint is that this place closes way too early. They are near ASU and would make a killing during late night service.

Meh-so many other places for brunch out there, we won't be back. Slow service, and pretty expensive for what you get. Had the creme brûlée pancakes which were just ok. Tiny sides of syrup and by the time the server came back I was almost done with my meal. Skip this one.

One of the best yoga studios I have ever visited. I feel completely at home here. If you are looking for a place to completely let go of any negativity and stress, look no further. Welcoming instructors and a wide variety of classes offered, there is something for everyone. I just attended the last evening session of the day held by candlelight. This is not to be missed. The first class is free!

First time at this local bar. It was too hot to sit on the patio for us today, but found a great seat and had an awesome server. Very attentive and made good recommendations. Good happy hour food and beer selections. Turkey tacos were good, on the lighter side and cheap! Happy hour food is $3.99 and $1 off beers. Also had chips & queso, my husband had hot wings that he said were tasty, but could have used a little more sauce. He also had the southwest turkey sandwich meal that he liked. Good grub for a local pub. The food was above average..maybe a 3.5.. But the service bumped up my review. Good food and prices, comfortable & clean environment topped off by great service. We will be back.

Had the Danish salad with shrimp. So delicious and fresh. Green peach iced tea was good. My friend order the same salad but they forgot to put the dressing on, which is the reason for the 4 stars. Get an Arnold Palmer with their fresh brewed iced tea and lemonade. Nice atmosphere and good prices too. I'll be back!

Delicious food, amazing cocktails. Great service! Thank you bar tender Joshua for taking care of us last evening. The place is tiny any with a storm brewing outside, so without having a reservation we chose to eat at the bar. First the cocktails. They will sneak up on you so watch out! Probably the best Gin and tonic I've ever had. My husband, the whiskey drinker, enjoyed all of Joshua's drink recommendations as well.  The food also delicious. We shared  a bread plate, the octopus (a must) and the pork with seasonal veggies. Dessert was a chocolate cake with butterscotch and vanilla ice cream. Everything perfect. We will be back for another drink sooner than later! I  deducted one star because we couldn't get a table. I realize we didn't have a reservation but every table except one was empty the entire time we were there.

We made an attempt to come here on opening night, which was a big waste of time...however we were not disappointed on our second try. The happy hour prices are great, offsetting the cost of some of the higher priced concoctions. There is something for everyone on this menu, just ask for a recommendation if you can't decide. The old Fashioned was delicious along with a few other drinks we ordered. We also ordered this corn and cheese dip which was unique, fresh and quite yummy. Too many chips and not enough dip was my one and only snag. I guess the chef thought the dip was taking too long so he sent out the glass noodles with cuttlefish.on the house! Sounds weird and looks weird, but amazing! Service was excellent. Beth, our server, was very helpful, attentive and fun! Nice work Bitter & Twisted for making our second visit a success.

Went here with some friends for dinner and managed to catch happy hour. The decor is modern and TVs around the place which was important for the guys since we are in playoff season. The happy hour menu has tons of stuff and great deals on drinks- $4 for house wine is a pretty good start. Lobster Mac n cheese is a must. Crab cake was not enough for sharing. That was good but least favorite item. The beer steamed clams we good. Ask for some rolls for that delicious broth. For dinner my husband and I split a steam pot called the tide roast. Beautiful tomato cream sauce, tons of shrimp, crawfish and clams. On of the best meals I have had in a very long time. Service was good. Took a while to get our drinks initially, but after that no problem. This place is worth the drive to Gilbert. Go now!

What a fabulous mani pedi my friend and I just experienced! And the girls can actually do nail art! I've been to tons of places that the polish or design is a mess. This place has great talent, reasonable prices and convenient location. I'll be back for sure!

Very good buffet! Excellent sampling of both of both meat and vegetarian dishes. Complementary soda and glass of champagne was a nice surprise. Agit made sure we had en enjoyable experience and seemed to really take pride in his restaurant. We will be back!

This is our new sushi spot. No matter what we order the food is delicious. I describe the place as sort of a sports bar, no frills but great deals. The happy hour menu offers 2 half rolls so you can get more variety. If you don't know if you like sushi, or you don't like raw fish, not to worry! There are other cooked choices as well. You get a complimentary bowl of miso soup and a salad, and finish the meal with a cute little dessert with sliced apples with caramel. We've tried many sushi places in the valley and this is one of the best.

Solid 4 stars. It's hard to compare anything to a fresh poke bowl in Hawaii but this place is darn close! I enjoyed a half and half brown rice and salad base, citrus dressing, tuna and salmon with all of the toppings. I'd rather see fresh sliced avocado than a scoop of avocado, but still great. I had all of the toppings except for the fish eggs. We came for dinner and served very quickly. It is the same idea as a chipotle, assembly line style, pick what you want! The staff seems to be pretty in tune. Great location too. My husband and I really enjoyed it and hope this place opens up in Tempe!
