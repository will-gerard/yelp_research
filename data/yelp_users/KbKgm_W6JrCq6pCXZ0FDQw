I give this place a 2.5 tops! How is this establishment rated so high? I had Mongolian beef that was about as good as sweet rubber and the cream cheese wonton....... Sad sad sad excuse for a cream cheese wonton. Try somewhere else first.

Hands down the best take out in the area! I was starving when I got home and they left a flyer in my door. Lucky me I gave them a shot. Best cream cheese wonton I've had in a long time. Tsos chosen is great too

Horribly average and over priced. Customer service is lacking. Burgers don't come with fries so it's not as cheap as people say it is. 8 bucks for a very small burger all cooked well done. Never coming here again.

Nothing makes this pizza stand out. Very bland and bad customer service. There are two entrances an it looks like two separate restaurants but it isn't. These guys also own char. I've seen many restaurants come to this location to die. Good luck boys

Fantastic and worth the price. Walked for about an hour to get to the seafood shack and was horribly disappointed. Came over here and got our food within 5 minutes and it's delicious. This place is awesome!

I really wanted this place to be good but it just didn't work out that way. I am actually kinda surprised that they were able to get my noodles To taste like burnt steak and my Mongolian beef to have the taste and consistency of a pink rubber eraser. Really really bad and currently nauseous. The crab puffs were just as good as my Mongolian beef only difference was they were pure liquid inside. No clue what's in these things......... Check that one off of the to do list...... Not ever again!!

I don't know how you folks are rating or if your basing your review on some sort of bias. I just paid 9 dollars for the equivalent of a McDonald's egg mc muffin. English muffinthawed out pre-made low quality sausage pattycrappy generic cheese. Sandwich complete.........Can't see this one surviving. I use yelp for every new restaurant I try and am extremely disappointed by you other yelpers.
