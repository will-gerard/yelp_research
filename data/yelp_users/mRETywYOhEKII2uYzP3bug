Great visit. Movies are entirely overpriced. Do not fall for their membership unless you plan on buying several books a month you will never make your money back. Employees were very helpful, and I walked away with tons of books for myself, my wife, and our daughter for less than 20 dollars(thanks to the clearance sections.

I have been here 5 times in the last two weeks (and ordered 30 wings each time)which is dumb of me after the first time, but I will not be coming back again they have failed to get my order correct one again they evidently do not know what sloppy wings are. The customer service is also horrible I stood there for about 5 minutes before being acknowledged and another 5 before the incompetent staff came to assist me. They have lost a valued customer I will either travel across the street or the extra couple miles to El mirage when we need a hot wing fix.

I really like this location, but today makes the third time I've bought meat that is bad. All the expiration dates have been 2 weeks or more away, yet, I've had 2 ground turkeys that smelt like death, and now a twin pack of bacon.  I think I will continue to shop there for other products but never anymore meat. I will renew and travel to costco for my meat because I've never had an issue there. Aside from the 50 dollars I've wasted on meat here, it is a great location staff is friendly and stock is maintained.

Although I usually go to the El Mirage location I have been here twice leaving the gym. They are exactly the same pizza is mediocre, nothing special, wings (suicide and hot) are absolutely amazing chicken is cooked properly wings are crispy and sauce is tasty. What more can you ask for. They only give packets of blue cheese ( and charge 50 cents) which I hate but the wings are the best I have had and they pay attention to your order (most of the time) and get it correct. I have eaten wings all over the valley but somehow I always end up back at US Pizza.

I'm originally from California, and if people really think the line or wait is long here please never move to California. I have been here multiple times and have never had to wait longer than 15 minutes. Only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because they don't ever seem to be able to answer the question,"how are you today".

This was my wifes office throughout her pregnancy. We absolutely loved Dr. Suhn (spell check) he is amazing. The entire office made us feel at home besides one of the ladies who do scheduling, she was usually pretty rude and rushed us off, but one bad seed cannot ruin the foundation they have established. Dr. Howard however, was usually behind schedule but a friend of my wifes referred us to him and says he was the best shes ever had (she has 4 kids, 2 delivered by Howard). Most of the time the doctors are out of the office because unlike most other practices they are with the women throughout their pregnancy and make it a point to be there and deliver the baby, not pawn you off on another ob that you've never encountered. We will be returning back to Palm Valley when we conceive another child.

Great, honest, gentlemen here at Apex auto. I found them on craigslist after weeks of searching for a reliable mechanic. They struck me as good mechanics so I gave them a try and they were affordable, knowledgeable, and most importantly honest. I have not had the chance to get back but I definitely will take all of my business to them.
