Decided to try a new place for pizza delivery ... And sorry I made that choice. Ordered a margarita pizza and kids mac and cheese. Dry - both the pizza and Mac and cheese. I might give it a try again and order something else but first, I need to drink some water.

Decent supply of all kinds of party items, but I'm writing this more for their great service with helium balloon orders. Have dropped of balloons here weeks in advance of a party and they were always ready at pick up time. Nice community party place.

Our family loves Hubbard swim! We have a baby and toddler in classes. It's not survival style but our kids have learned to enjoy the water and can go under without being scared.

Perfect place for kids! Grassy fields and plenty of shade make great picnic spots. The train rides, museum and playgrounds provide just the right amount of fun for little ones. Rides don't start until 10:00 (9:00 in the summer) so time your visit appropriately!

This is the kind is sushi place I like. Small and unassuming but oh so good. People were lined up to  get in on a Saturday night. Prices are reasonable and the quality is one of the best in Arizona.

It is what it is. My three year old had a blast at a friends' birthday party. He couldn't ride everything because he was too short for some of the rides but he was smiling and laughing ear to ear on the rides he went on. Are the rides old? Yes, but they seemed to be in fine working order and frankly, it didn't matter to us because we had a blast. The ride attendants were fun and engaging with the children for the most part. As a parent, my joy was watching my kids have fun. We'll be back.

I should have read the reviews before going. Our group had a few toddler-aged children with us, and yup, the noise scared them. It is a cool (even though kitschy) set up, and seemed like it would have been a kid-friendly place, but it's probably better for older kids, maybe 5-6ish. So, that's one thing (and not the reason I'm giving one star because, well, I guess I should have known) ... but the food, wow ... now I wasn't expecting spectacular food, but OMG it was awful. My body feels polluted after eating here. The kids' Dino nuggets were the best thing I nibbled on. Hubby's burger tasted like rubber (he said), my coconut shrimp was dipped in batter, rolled in sugar, fried and then rolled in sugar again, and the adult tropical beverage was a joke --- waaaaaay too syrupy sweet and hardly any alcohol.

The lady who did my pedicure was a little hurried (even though I was one of only three people in there) and it was rough ... I'm surprised I didn't bleed from her cuticle removal and callous scrub (admittedly, I have very rough, dry and calloused feet but she was so hard on them!!). But, I left unscathed (my nerves were wracked though!) The pedicure was decent and looks good. The place was clean but not super clean. I might go back in a pinch but would ask for a different tech.

I've been going to Biltmore Commons for over 5 years. Drs. Sadowski and Balastrino are fantastic, as are the regular hygienists. Attentive, good with explaining options and excellent execution.

I like Smelly Dog a lot. I've used both the self wash and grooming service. The self wash is super easy and a there is always a full stock of supplies on hand and helpful wash-area staff. I've always been satisfied with the grooming of my shih tzu as well - the last groom was outstanding! There is a good selection of dog food, snacks and toys and the staff generally has a good understanding of the quality and ingredients in the brands of food they carry. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the sales are always pretty slow and there seems to be some confusion on customer service priorities - example, on one occasion when I was just trying to buy a bag of dog food (and I was the only one in the store) I waited for about four minutes for the counter sales staff to acknowledge me as I stood right in front of her as she talked on the phone about the comings and goings of the groomer, appointments, and other general, clearly non-emergency issues. When the clerk finally got off the phone she did apologize and then told me she was talking to the owner who wanted an update on the happenings of the store - I think the priority in this case should have been the customer standing in front of her. It would have been wiser to put the owner on hold and ring up a quick sale. It was only four minutes, I know, but it was kind of annoying and made me, a customer, feel like my business was not that important. Overall though, a good local place to get everything pup-related taken care of!

My favorite spa in the Phoenix area --- I always have an incredibly relaxing experience here and all therapists (massage or body) that have worked on me are top notch --- I will never forget Crystal who gave me the best massage I've ever had back in 2007 (she's not there anymore but, wow, I will never forget that massage!). The pool area is the best!!

I went here for about 10 months before and after conceiving my oldest child. Dana Price is amazing at what she does and she is super nice, compassionate and down to earth. I highly recommend! The facility is calm and relaxing and they carry a good selection of herbs and educational books.

My two children have attended this daycare and preschool - my oldest for three years and my youngest still attends. We love it! The caregivers and teachers in all of the classrooms have all been super nice and I appreciate how patient and loving they are with the children. The Director is very approachable and seems very committed to children and the school - pretty much every time I'm at the school whether it's for pick up or drop off, she's present and interacting with the children or staff so that is comforting.  My husband and I both work full time and do everything to educate and spend quality time with our children but I know a lot of the knowledge and skills my oldest child has came from the instruction he received at Mountain View - he learned how to sing songs, say sweet prayers, ABC's & 1,2,3's and exhibits a superb mastery of language - now, maybe it's because he's just brilliant (okay, okay, just being a mom here ... ;)) but the caregivers and teachers have certainly helped him thrive and have helped shaped my little awesome monster into the amazing boy he is ...  It's a smaller preschool so has a great family feel and they welcome parents at all times - I really like that. The kids learn how to garden, play sports and have fun with music. There are events throughout the year, like a Halloween walk, Thanksgiving dinner and cultural dinner ... The playground is awesome and in the summers, they have water day once a week which my kids have loved!! All in all, it's a great place and I would recommend for anyone seeking a nurturing and welcoming daycare/preschool.

I go here all the time for a good, cheap mani/pedi. The place is clean, they sanitize instruments, offer water, and the chairs are comfortable.

Pretty much the slowest service ever both times I've been here. Edible food but not great, although I am comparing taste and quality to one of my most beloved restaurants, Versailles, in Los Angeles ---- this place is in Arizona ... In the East Valley .... kind of bums me out that my expectation for good food is lowered out here, but it is what it is. I'd never make a special trip, nor stand in line for an hour (like I would for Versailles) to eat here but I'd go if everyone else I'm with wants to go.

We used the taco cart catering service for a birthday party and couldn't have been happier with the food. Our taco guy, Enrique(?) was also awesome, the tacos were a hit with our 50+ party guests (especially the carne asada). If you want to pay with credit card though make sure you make advance arrangements - I had to scramble to find a check to pay the balance at the end of the night. We would definitely use the taco catering again.

In a nutshell, good fast-food burgers that are a bit tastier than other places. Arizona burger is delicious - as delicious as a fast food burger can get and they have gluten free buns which is a huge bonus! My kids love the mini-burgers and fries. My issue with this place, and a lot of other restaurants that we order take out from, is that they ALWAYS forget to give us our kids drinks. Maybe it's because I always request organic milk for my kids as part of their kids' meal and I know that's more expensive than asking for soda pop ... Who knows ... but I feel like it's a purposeful "oops forgot your drink" because every single time my hubby picks up an order the milk for my kids is forgotten. Our bad really as we should double check, but their bad for consistently failing to provide part of our meal.

This place has gone downhill fast ... I've been eating here regularly for 6 years and most of that time, the food has been decent but nothing spectacular - it's the closest sushi restaurant to my home, so I deal ... but my most recent visit may have been my last. Sashimi and fish used in rolls was not fresh, not even close to fresh. The fish tasted and smelled old. Servers are nice but slow even when not crowded. (Although in the past, we've had super-servers, friendly, attentive and great with kids, so have to give them props!)  Kids meals are "recycled", I'm sure of it - generally my kids have love eating here and have loved the kids' meals - and I'll admit, I've nibbled on their leftovers and the meat (beef) has been tasty in the past but on this last visit, I swear the food was re-heated for like the 3rd or 4th time, from days-ago cooked meat. It was nasty, super tough, burnt. Give the adults bad food, fine, we can drink alcohol to kill the nastiness .... but do not give my children old as f*** food just because they're kids - not cool.

As far as aquariums go, this place is tiny and probably not worthy of more than two stars ... but it's in a crappy mall so one can't really expect too much. However, in another context, worthy of four stars for the family friendly factor (ie, living in the middle of the desert, mom of small children looking for fun things to do with kids, indoors, during the summer, without having to drive too far). This is a great place to go for about an hour to check out sea life. There's a fun playground at the end too where you can just let your little one go!

5 star dogs... Service was a bit slow - we came at opening with a baby and a toddler which means we don't get to casually converse and linger - but somehow we lasted a whole hour and then some, and service was friendly. The kids' mac and cheese looked so good I had to steal a few bites from my little one. It was good. The hot dog combos were delicious. Overall, we loved it and we'll be back.

Eh. I'm on a sushi bust apparently... Was hoping for much better given the reviews. Small place, which I thought meant it would be outstanding but I was wrong. Ramen is ... Okay. I ordered a chicken ramen but didn't know it came cold - can't remember if the menu indicated that or not so might be my bad, but regardless, was very disappointed and tried to send it back. I tried to swap out for a hot ramen but they insisted that I also pay for the one I didn't want. No establishment should make a patron buy food he or she doesn't want or like. Sushi was decent, nothing great. Best was the beef bowl - I kept stealing bites from my kid.

Nice place if you have time for a long and leisurely lunch. I have walked by this place many times, never thinking it would be good but I'm glad I have it a try today. Yummy tomato soup - tasted smoky - the burger was delicious but I needed a nap after eating it (it's big enough to share and still leave stuffed as a turkey on Thanksgiving).

My husband, baby and I went here on an early Friday night. The neighboring Yard and Culinary Dropout were pretty crowded, but not so much so that we couldn't find a place to hang out comfortably with baby while we waited for a table. We parked ourselves into a couple of the chairs by the cornhole field. Baby loved watching the athletes play cornhole. The husband and I sipped a on a Pineapple-something beer from The San  Brewing Co. stand - it tasted better than I expected (I'm generally not the hugest fan of San Tan beers). It's noisy out there - the music coming from Culinary Dropout is insanely loud - but good cover for a talkative baby. After a 30 minute wait, we were called in for our table. The hostess and servers were very friendly. The decor was fresh, clean and inviting. We started out by ordering a dozen oysters - but the server had to check to see where the oysters were harvested from (he probably should have known that to begin with as one of this restaurant's main features is an oyster bar). The oysters were delicious and very fresh - we probably could have ordered a few dozen of these and called it a night, but we went with some small plates instead. We got the octopus, hushpuppies, king crab and scallops. Everything was executed well and tasted fresh. We were surprised to have enjoyed the hushpuppies so much. The crab and butter dish was excellent, the scallops were good and my husband really enjoyed the octopus. Are there better seafood places in this world? Yes, but Little Cleo's is pretty good for Phoenix. We'll be back.

We (spouse and kids) love it there. And they totally welcome kids - LOVE that they have organic milk to give the kiddos. My toddler loves the beans and nachos. The chiliquiles and enchiladas are good.

Maybe dinner time is better, with fresher ingredients but for lunch, salad served on past few occasions I dined here was terribly wilted and drenched in dressing to mask the un-freshness. I have been here on a couple of occasions and the pizza has been decent, when served whole, but lunch time slices are pretty pitiful. Overall, edible in a pinch, but would not go out of my way to dine here other than for the convenience of a lunch-time place near my office.
