From the moment I pulled up to the store for a simple tire inflation, RJ (the service team member) expediently assisted us and he was extremely helpful and polite.  Even though our issue was minor RJ dealt with it in a timely fashion and he took the time to educate us on how to take the best care of our tires so they would last longer.  I am thankful for his help and the nature in which he handled our issue.  I would strongly recommend this store and be sure to ask for RJ.

Absolutely disgusting in every way!!!! From waiting for over an hour for the Teppan Table to The ONE Chef who was sweating like a PIG over himself and dripping in onto the the Teppan Table to the waitress who clearly had no idea what she was doing (water glasses left empty, multiple requests to fill the water glasses going unfilfilled, dirty plates left lingering, two of five orders being flat out wrong, and ultimately adding/charging our party of five for two Teppen orders that were not even ordered) to the mysterious un-mentioned $30.00 gratuity that was added to our bill, the list went on and on and on...  After realizing the errors, we contacted the owner's wife and she refused to accept any responsibility for these unfortunate experiences.  Ultimately, before being hung up on by the owner's wife, we were left with the comment, "Maybe you should go out to eat at Taco Bell since you complain about your bill!"  After the experience at Electric Eel, I think Taco Bell would have been preferable.

Recently, I had the VI Peel to help with my melasma and pigmentation.  Jennifer, the aesthetician was extraordinarily warm, gentle, and communicative about how the procedure would help with my problem areas.  I would highly recommend Adam and Eve for any medical aesthetic needs.  From the staff to the clinic itself, in every way imaginable, this place makes you feel like a VIP.  Once the procedure is over, you are left looking and feeling like a movie star.

I called to schedule bI- weekly. The girl who answered the phone was NOT at all professional or friendly. I was hesitant to call and use them again since she was already rude and unprofessional the 1st time I booked. But I thought maybe she was having a bad day. Well go figure it sounded like she was having yet another bad day today because when I said they had quoted me $85.00 when they came to clean the 1st time she said it would be $95.00. I was like I'm calling to re-schedule bi weekly. But instead of say to a returning client no problem I can still honor that. He answer was NO!! I was like really your going to lose a client of $10.00 DOLLARS. Well needless to say BAD ATTITUDE, BAD BAD  BUSINESS...No Sweat of my back I rather give my money to someone who know's how to be professional and appreciative of a client. AZ MAIDS DON'T HOLD THE PENNY SO CLOSE TO YOUR EYE THAT YOU CAN'T SEE THE DOLLAR BEHIND IT..
