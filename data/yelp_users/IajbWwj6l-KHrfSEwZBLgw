I was in the area on my way to the convention center when I stopped in for some lunch.  Place is only a half a block from the convention center so location was awesome! I know the place seems to be geared for Mexican cuisine, but their menu was a little all over the place.  They have sandwiches, Mexican food, and Mediterranean food.  I went with a grilled cheese sandwich, why not.  It was a huge grilled cheese on sour dough bread nice and buttery with a huge side of seasoned fries. It was soo good! I asked for a side of ranch and it was yummy!  I don't eat downtown to much but if I go to another convention I'll sure stop in for another grilled cheese.

Ok Mexican food.  Stopped in for lunch and ordered the number three which is a two taco and cheese enchilada plate. Food was ok, but nothing I would go back for.

Just came back from the Pirate Exhibit!  Loved it!  I had purchased a bogo free ticket from Groupon a month or so ago so wanted to wait for the crowds to die down before going.  So glad I purchased those.  The exhibit is truly amazing!  I really lived out my childhood fantasy since seeing the Goonies when I turned around the corner and saw a pirate chest full of coins just sitting there.  My eyes lit up as if I were five.  So cool!  Right by that show stopper they had an exhibit display where you could actually touch the coins.  They had many artifacts from this lost sunken pirate ship on display and gave a great overall view of life for the pirates spread throughout.  A++

I've passed this place numerous times on my way out to First Fridays, so when I saw a groupon for it I quickly jumped on the deal.  I thought it was a regular taco shop, and didn't realize it was an actual restaurant until I got inside.  The place was pretty messy looking, and chairs were a straight up and down, not so comfortable to sit in.   Our waiter came around and he was super friendly and came out with some chips and salsa.  Chips and salsa weren't anything special, kind of tasted bland.  We ordered margarita's, one regular lime on the rocks, and the other a spicy mango one.  Both of those were really good.  We both ordered a chimichanga, one chicken the other green chili beef, also very bland tasting.   I wouldn't go back, just cause the food is bland, and the ambiance was kind of stale and weird.

This place is just magical.  The garden has thousands of desert plants and Cati that you've never seen before or could imagine exists. It really takes you into a different world.  The landscape goes on for miles, with all sorts of winding trails that makes you feel like your on an adventure hunt. The staff are super friendly and helpful.  I've gone during the day and for the flashlight tour... Flashlight tours are really different and put a little adventure into finding animals in the dark, but defiantly go during the day time to be able to enjoy all the pretty blooming flowers.  If you are a photographer you will never want to leave.  If you live or are visiting the valley do yourself a favor and visit..

I give this place two stars just because you have a great view of the entertainer your going to see here.  This Venue is nice because it's small and they do get some really good acts that pass through town here.  Other then that, I find the seating is way to small and uncomfortable, and location to be in a shady area of town.  Drink prices are way to high and the sound at a couple of the shows I've been to hasn't been great.  If someone I really want to see comes into town here, I'll force myself to be super uncomfortable, and deal with it.  But they've got to be someone I've been really, really wanting to see.

Cool Brewery!  Cruising down the street a little brewery popped out of nowhere.  It was a hot afternoon and a nice cold local brewed beer sounded like it would hit the spot.  Stopped in and right away I felt at home.  The waitress had a huge smile and greeted us and let us know we could sit anywhere we wanted, she also came back to us numerous times checking that we had everything we needed.  Seemed like the main room next to the bar was the happen spot. Husband ordered the vanilla seasonal stout, and I got the Hefeweizen. Both beers were good but we liked the vanilla seasonal so much we bought a to go 64oz Growler.  We ordered the honey hot wings and they were amazing.  Not so much hot but the sweetness and crust of the wings hit the spot, so good, would totally order that again.  All and all the vibe is really nice, super friendly service, great food, and beer is awesome.  Will be back!

Stopped in for lunch last Friday to meet with a friend. Went at 12noon and was surprised to get a seat right away.  Although it was outdoor seating only available.  I ordered a sausage sandwich with the basket weave fries.. Delish.. love it.. although it takes a little while for food to come out, it's well worth it.  They also give you a huge plastic cup of soda.  Our service was ok, it seemed like our waiter was covering a lot of different tables, but then again I'm a pretty mellow person and didn't mind waiting.  But again the food was mackin, and my friend and I ordered the ice cream pizza cookie.. omgoodness, so good.  soft chewy under baked cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.. Enjoy but it's pretty big so I would suggest sharing.

Good Meat and selection of sausages.  Nice prices for being hand stuffed right in the building next door!  Good stuff!

All make this short and sweet, eatable but nothing great.  Prices too much for this over-hyped place.  Had the Giuseppe sub for lunch, alright but was wanting more stuff on the inside. Sandwich was overpowered by the bread.

Maybe it was an off day or something for this place..  Stopped in for lunch today, it's a Saturday.  Place is in a strip mall.  Decorations are something you would see in party city around Mardi Gras time, (pretty cheesy).  Service was nice and friendly.  Now lets get down to the food part of this.   I'm very hesitate to say but I must, it wasn't good.. Yes I've read the other reviews but I've been and lived in New Orleans and I have to say I don't think this should be called Cajun.  The flavors are so bland I couldn't taste any spice at all on anything.  Food seemed really dry like it might have been sitting awhile. My husband and I ordered the Boudin Balls for an app.  Now those were decent.  I ordered a Shrimp Po'boy, and my husband ordered the Jambalaya.  My shrimp Po'boy had old bread and was cut in half with 4 medium size shrimps on each half., sorry not enough shrimp for a sandwich that cost nearly 11 bucks at lunch.  The Remoulade sauce only had one flavor... Horseraddish, it was super strong and was awful.  So eh on the Po'boy, it came with a side of burnt homemade potato chips, ate like one and decided to pass on the plate of them. I felt really bad though looking at my husbands plate.  It was a stacked high rice dish with these shriveled up sausages thrown on the side of the dish.  I had a taste of his, first the rice... really dry.. Then I took a little bit of this beef jerky sausage, it was so dry and had no taste at all.  I told him he must dump hot sauce all over that dish because there is nothing going on there.   So yeah.. not sure if it's what we ordered or what, but Flavors of Louisiana is way better if your craving Cajun food in the valley. P.S.  My husband ordered Tea, it's wasn't Louisiana Tea, nor sweet as they make it in the south... would have been nice to have been given the option for sweet tea!

Must say this is the best pizza I've tasted in the valley!  Went here Friday night with my husband and we were in the mood for something naughty... we found it..     We ordered "The Super Six Pizza", which is sorta the combo they have....    As soon as I saw it I thought, Come here you little slice of heaven..spank, spank....     I think it was a little of everything that made this pizza for me...   The sauce was sweet and had a lot of tasty flavor.  The toppings were the perfect amount and you could actually taste all the different flavors of the meats while eating them.  The cheese was plentiful and the medium pizza for the two of us was more then enough.  You can really taste the love that was put into this pie.  I think it was the owner or chef, or both that came out and greeted everyone on the porch chit chatting with everyone to make it feel more homely.   **** Yes I think my search for a fabulous pizza is over with, I woke up the next morning craving it...  ****  Must return, and must return soon.

Drove in Sunday on my way with my husband for a scenic tour of the Apache Trail and all the wildflowers that are in bloom now...   Driving up to this place I kinda got excited seeing a massive old west looking town right off the road.  After driving on a freeway forever and seeing noting but dirt, rocks and catus this town was like eye candy.  It brought me back to childhood with my imagination of what would have gone on here over a century ago.  Parking was ok, had to wait a couple of minutes for a space but that was ok.   Walked up and found this town to be a little bit of a let down, right away got the whole Disneyland feel of fakeness.   Guess if I were a kid I wouldn't mind it, but being an adult it was a let down.  Instead of finding museums with history facts of the town it was just cheesy gift shops one after the other.  The stuff they sold was solid junk and made me want to vomit.... We did walk around the grounds and saw antiques baking in the sun laying all around.  They have horseback ridding, but seemed really expensive as far as prices...  Also noticed there was a Mine Tour, a little reptile exhibit and a bordello tour, all of course cost money.   My husband and I took the bordello tour which was $3 each... we thought that wasn't a lot of money till we got in.  The tour lady told us a quick 5 minute spill of what life was like for these women and then let us roam around the whole three rooms of the tour, which weren't big rooms..  I felt like I was walking through a antique store, because there were price tags to sell all the items on display... It really was tacky... We left thinking Really???   Then came in the middle of town for a short gun show.  That was a little cute, but a really short act.  We didn't want to eat here so we took off...  We won't be stopping here again...

Went here for dinner over the weekend with husband.  I kinda know what to expect from this place but felt like a sit down Mexican restaurant and was in the neighborhood.  Vibe is kinda like on the boarder, minus the tex mex part....Right away we were seated to our booth, booth for two people was a little awkward.  It's a half moon shape but our view was looking out onto a huge party of over 20 people, not very chill feeling.  I ordered a large house margarita on the rocks and a Mexican pizza.  Food took awhile to get to the table, we were already on our second basket of chips before our food arrived.  Pizza was ok, seemed like they skimped out on a lot of the toppings.  Margarita was weak also.  I usually get a little buzz going on when I order a large one, but I didn't get anything from that one.  As always the food at Macayo's seems to all drop to the bottom of your stomach like a rock....I think it's time to try something else even if I'm in the neighborhood.

Comic Bowling... DJ's...Lasers... sounds like fun don't it??? Well I thought it was going to be fun, according to their website I was picturing a dark, glow in the dark bowling alley with lasers and loud blaring music and drinking.  Hmm Hmm.. Went to cosmic bowling with a group of friends. Well we get there right when comic bowling starts... They had shut down all the lanes and started a line of people to start getting everyone ready.  Right away I noticed the crowd of people..  not what I was expecting...There were a lot of kids out late at night and still jumping and running around, and when I say kids I mean 3,4 and 5 year old's.  Finally got our lane and I was expecting it to get really dark so we could enjoy the black lights..  Nope didn't really happen, it still stayed pretty light in the bowling alley, and the lasers sucked.. Then I started waiting for the DJ and loud music.. ummm no.. that didn't happen either... they had put on some really bad music video's that we couldn't even hear over the bowling balls rolling down, which was probably a blessing.  Then we go to the bar to pick up some pitchers of beers, not any good beers on tap and the ones they had were super expensive for this dive place.. We stayed cause we paid money to play.. We left around 1:30am, and the kids were still running around like crazy, I kept thinking to myself, what the F**k are all these kids doing up at this time... I won't be going back..

I can't tell you how wonderful this store treats it's customers. I went in the store last night around 5:30ish, pretty close to closing time, due to a tire that was looking really low. I thought I had run over a nail or something and was worried I'd have to shell out some money for a new tire. I popped in and the place was packed, I mean a line of about 5 or 6 people and the store only being open another half hour. So I was worried I wouldn't be able to be serviced by the time my turn was up.   I was thinking of leaving, but thought I'd at least try. Well the line went by super fast and as soon as I got up to the counter to explain my problem the guy at the counter ran out to look at my tire right then, so no wait at all. Turns out the tire pressure was all whacked and I pulled up near a stall, and another guy in the service doors pulls up and checks all my tires for free! I felt very safe driving home and was happy to get the special attention even when they were slammed with work orders. In the past I've gone to discount tire to fill holes in my tires when I've ran over nails, and they are always very kind and helpful getting me on my way. Special thanks to Kyle (he's the guy who checked my tire pressure), great job! There might be cheaper tire stores out there, but the service at this store is worth paying a little more.

Yes, Yes, and Yes!!   Stopped in here last Friday night to get some grub on with my husband. We've been meaning on coming in here for a long time since we saw the Triple D show on the food network. Everything on the show looked awesome. We pulled up to this shinny silver building with a huge pig on it, and walked through the huge silver doors into the restaurant. Right away we were greated and sat into our booth.   The server came right over and asked us if we wanted water, and took our drink order. As we were browsing the menu we stopped to look at the decor in the inside. Wow, It was a little crazy with all the pigs in there. All sorts of souvenir pigs in all shapes and sizes. If you are a collector of pigs you'll fit right in at this location. Also you could see around the room all the ribbons and trophy's that have been won at numerous BBQ cook offs. (There was a lot of them)   They also had TVs placed around the restaurant with one channel on sports. And the other with a channel dedicated to the food this restaurant cooks. I watched that channel to help me decide on what I should try. They showed recorded footage of how they prepare the food for different BBQ contest, and had the copy of the Triple D show that was aired.   Our waiter came around and took our order for an App. We decided to try the deep fried pickles. We also ordered our main course at the same time. My husband got the rack of ribs with mash potato's and salad, and I got the half order of shredded pork on the lighter menu with a side of BBQ beans.   Our pickles came, and yummy!! They were both sweet and savory at the same time. My husbands side salad came, and that looked big! He only was able to eat 1/4 of it because he wanted to save room for the big daddy meal.   Our plates came, and we dug in.. OMG.. wow, I can only say this, I can see why they have won all those trophies and ribbons. Just wonderful, mmmmm, good. The sauce was nice and sweet, and there was plenty to put on it. The meat was moist and cooked to perfection. My beans were wonderful, so tasty... I was glad I decided to get those. Both meals came with a side of corn bread, which I thought was a little dry to my liking, but the meat made me forget that was even an option of eating that. My plate even being a half portion was huge. I could only eat less then a half of it before being stuffed beyond belief. I tried my husbands ribs, and ohhhh they melted off the bones. So good it should be a sin. I did try his mash potatoes and wasn't all that into them, they kinda reminded me of KFC's with the sort of gravy that was on them.   While I was eating there, I smiled and thought to myself, I've always seen those BBQ cook off shows and always wanted to taste what the winners food taste like. I can happily say yes, I know what it's all about now... I will not hesitate to stop in here again for some perfectly cooked meat.   We rolled outside! The night was cloudy, windy and looked as if it were going to let loose on pouring down rain, when I looked back at this big shinny building, and could imagine a streaming beam of light coming right down on this little pleasure palace. When we passed by the outback across the street I looked at all the cars, and said to myself with a grin-----Fools, you really don't know what your missing..

Restaurant looked very clean, and had a nice artsy decor. I also liked the restaurant didn't have blaring music playing so you can actually talk without screaming with the people you're dinning with,unlike other Mexican sit down places. I went for lunch and ordered off the lunch menu which had a good selection at a good price.  Service was fast and the food was good.  It was nice not to have to wait on the weekend to get seated around lunchtime.

Stopped in for an early dinner, after driving past here two times and the parking lot was packed.  This place fills like a little blast from the past without all the cheesy 50's dinners everyone is familiar with.  Atmosphere is super comfortable from the minute you walk into the place.  The staff was outgoing and very nice.  I ordered a screamer cheeseburger, my husband ordered a BBQ burger and we split an order of seasoned fries.  The place has all the great classic burgers and shakes on the menu, even tater tots.  Burger and fries were excellent!  I totally know where to stop to eat next time in Wickenburg, Az.

Stay Away from here!!  Don't eat Here!!  I wish they had a Zero Star rating!!!   Horrible, Horrible!!   Our party of four ordered pizza and an order of fries to be delivered to our hotel off the downtown strip on Friday night, on recommendation from the bell desk. First when we called to order they said it would take anywhere from 45min-1 hour to get to us, and we would have to wait in the lobby for the driver.   OK, so it's our weekend in Vegas, and we had to wait in the lobby for an hour, I thought OK.. I can see that, it's a busy night with traffic and all. So we ordered our pizza, and waited, waited and waited.. Did I say we waited??? OK, it took over two hours for the driver to deliver our food. We all rushed up stairs to eat, cause we were starving. The pizza was $20 bucks, and the fries $3.   We got up to the room and the freaking pizza was stone cold. We opened the french fries, and OMG, so nasty.. The fries were drenched in grease from sitting, stone cold, and rubbery, not eatable. No one dared to touch those.. We did eat the pizza, but because we where hungry.. It wasn't good either.., tasted like it sat around for a few hours.. you know those party days where you wake up the next morning and eat a piece of pizza, a little stale, and hard.. yeah.. that's what I'm talking about.   That night, I didn't want it to ruin my night, so we partied.. Anyways the next morning I got to thinking that was just wrong.. Why did we pay $30 for crap food like that, and how can they have given us cold food??   I was very calm, and wanted to give the resturant some feedback to how I was feeling.  I called the restaurant, and before I could even tell the lady my complaint or what order I was calling about, she cuts me off and pretty much tells me I'm lying.. I've worked in customer service for over 15 years now and know the standard of how to treat a customer, blah blah blah, Oh I'm so sorry about that...smile.(wink).. but no,  I was really Mad by how rude she was treating me over the phone, and told her it's nice that her customer service skills don't included listening to the customer. I would not recommend this pizza place to anyone!!   Stay Away! Unless you like cold food, rude employees, and enjoy waiting for hours... Seriously Zero Stars!!!

My husband and I decided to go to lunch on Monday labor day, and wanted a nice big juicy burger. We've never had nasty food at Fuddruckers so we decided to stop in here and split a big burger. We ordered the number 2. It's a huge burger 2/3 pounder, with fries and an endless refill of drinks. We also ordered a side of onion rings. I didn't see the dirtiness others have suggested in previous reviews listed.   The restaurant is covered with memorabilia from old rock artist, we decided to sit near the Elvis corner of the building. They do have 3 or four booths in the corners but all were filled so we parked at a table and got our first of a few sodas. Right in front of us was a flat screen TV with football on.. Oh yeah, this was a nice casual atmosphere, burger, fries, football what else can you ask for. The place was pretty slow for a holiday around lunchtime, but I was OK with that. I mean I don't mind getting my food faster.   We waited about 15 minutes and split our food up and put all the toppings we prefer on our huge burger. Yumms, it was good. Nice and juicy perfect size to split into two. I was happy by coming here, you always know what to expect. The buns are nice and fresh and the selection of toppings is wonderful.   The only thing that bugged me was the onion rings were really greasy, so I put mine to the side. Also they must have had a district manager and manager present that afternoon, cause we kept getting starred at by people dressed in suits walking around. As soon as we were done with eating we had our plates picked up, and we hung out watching the end of the game for another 15 min or so. Thumbs up for me, I left happy and stuffed.

I went here with my husband last Sunday afternoon.  We had a 2 for 1 coupon out of the Entertainment guide.  We are from San Diego and have been trying to find Mexican food places similar to the food out in San Diego.  We pulled up to the location and were debating if we should go in or not.  The area wasn't the best, and it was in a tiny strip mall.  Kind of looked like a taco shop.  We decide to go in, because we were starving.  Inside it looked completely different.  It was a little dark and dated.  But the atmosphere was very causal and the hosts were super nice.  We sat down and right away got some nice warm chips, salsa and beans served to us.  I was feeling like a margarita and was going to get the house one, when the waitress said they had 99 cent margaritas available.  We ordered our food and didn't have to wait very long to get it.  Super good food and really cheap 99 cent margaritas. The margaritas were served in pretty nice size glasses but a bit strong.  FYI, I think you're getting really cheap alcohol in there, seemed pretty stiff. I started buzzing after my second glass.   My husband even loved the Chile reino that he tried from my plate.  He usually doesn't like it at all.  The carne asada was seasoned very well, it was a great change from some of the bland Mexican food I've had out here in phoenix. My husband had the beef chimichanga and it was seasoned really well also.  For the price you can't beat it.  From the outside the restaurant seems a little ghetto looking, but once you get inside it's pretty nice in there.  I would defiantly try it again.

This store has some excellent customer service.  I've been going here for years and always get asked several times if I need help.  I'm a needy kind of person, lol. So I know  I  will get  some great advise when I go here.  In this day in age with service it's nice to know where I can find some awesome assistance.   Don't forget to ring the bell when going out the door, they have that up there to tell the employee's they were helpful and you were happy with your service. :)

Stopped in last Friday for dinner.  My husband and I always drove by this place and had seen cars packed in the parking lot near this restaurant and thought it might be a good stop to eat at.  We walked in and noticed a nice decor.  We weren't expecting to much walking in but the atmosphere was pretty nice.  They had a huge wait staff waiting for diners to come in.  The place for being prime time dinner time on a Friday night was pretty empty.  I liked it cause we got sat right away.  The booths are really comfortable, very soft and relaxing.  Our waiter came right over to take our order.  We felt like a margarita or two, or three so we ordered a pitcher to start.  Looking over the menu it looked as if they would have some pretty good food so I thought we stumbled on to a nice place.  We ordered the fish taquitto for an app.  The margarita came out and it was perfect, exactly how I make mine at home so I was happy.  The app was served and I was like, What????  It was one taquitto sliced in three pieces, not even enough for one person to enjoy, way to small for a $9 app.  I was very disappointed.  We tried it and it wasn't good either.  The fish I swore said salmon on the menu, and we got some sort of white fish I can't even figure out with no flavor.  bummer....   We both ordered some sort of combo they had.  I got the beef taco's, and enchilada.  My taco's really reminded me of the authentic Mexican taco's I've gotten down in Mexico, you know the smaller ones.  It came with a side of pinto beans, and rice.  My enchilada wasn't anything special, the taco's were a little bland.  My opion would be you can go through any drive through Mexican taco shop and get the same quality food for 1/2 the price of this place.  If it weren't for the margarita lifting my spirits I would have been very bummed about the price we paid for our dinner.

Stopped into Lenny's on Monday night for a burger dinner around 6:30pm. I have never tried Lenny's before and have driven by this joint almost daily. I was craving a nice juicy burger and wanted to try something off the beaten path of all the fast food restaurants. The shop from the outside gives you the vibe of how the inside is. Straight up burger and fries joint. They don't mess around with some fancy menu. You've got maybe 5 or 6 burgers to choose from, so it's not to hard to decide which one you want to try first. I got the burger on sour dough combo, and my husband got the double burger combo. We decided to eat there on the stools and bar they have set up. It's a tiny little shop with about 10 stools to eat at, all facing the windows outside. You can expect to pay anywhere from 5-8 a combo, which is about what any fast food joint charges. We got our food and were hungry. I grabbed my burger and bit in. It was nice and juicy. The patty wasn't overwhelmingly big, but had a lot of grilled flavor to it. Along with my burger I got a nice huge helping of thick fries, and a large soda. The fries were perfectly hard on the outside and soft on the inside, just like I enjoy them. My husbands burger looked good too, he said it tasted yummy too. While we were in there we noticed a young crowd come in and out, for a Monday I saw they did pretty good business. Which surprised me because I noticed a note on the door saying they were no longer going to be open on Sundays.. Awhh, I thought. I hope they survive this tough economy, it's got to be hard being a burger shop right across the street from jack in the box, and burger king. For being local to my casa, I will diffiently be supporting there good burgers.. If you live in the area, check'em out.

Went back last night for some dinner, had the Mexican burger... not as good as I remember it.   Burger was super greasy, they were stingy on toppings and the prices seemed they went up a couple of dollars for a combo..  yes I'll be heading somewhere else from now on.

Mmmmmm, Mmmmm so good. Went here for dinner and was very impressed by this Restaurant. We walked in and the inside is pretty dated. What you'll see here is a throwback to an old Vegas buffet looking Restaurant. I mean they have high back booths covered with turquoise vinyl. Mirrored walls, look around and see plastic plants and flowers, but wonderful art framed on the walls. On this night there wasn't too many people dinning there, which I was surprised from how good the food was. Our waiter was super friendly and very outgoing.   We decided to get the egg drop soup for an app. Oh wow, was that some good stuff. We got a nice size bowl of this thick and well seasoned bowl of yumminess. Inside the bowl they had other veggies in there, with some chicken chunks also. I had never had egg drop soup with such flavor. We went on to order our meal. I ordered the dish called something like wonderful chicken, lol"just cause of the name", I thought you really can't go wrong with a name like that, it has to live up to it's reputation. My husband stuck with the orange chicken plate. Our wait staff came by numerous times checking on us and making sure our drinks were full, and took away the already eaten plates promptly.   We received our meals, and Wow!! The size was wonderful for the price they charge. I believe both our dishes were under $9 each. I looked at my wonderful chicken and took a bite. It was wonderful, the chicken was of the good white meat really tender, and it had a nice helping of veggies all around. And I'm not talking the huge chucks of broccoli other Chinese restaurants try to fill the plate with, these were all bite size veggies, the good ones I like to eat. The sauce was plentiful and made everything melt in my mouth. Since we were having Chinese both my husband and I shared our dishes. His orange chicken was really good also. The chicken had a lighter crust layering the chicken that made the chicken stand out more then some other orange chicken dishes we've had. The sauce again was super, you could really taste the orange flavor, in the orange chicken.   After our meal was over our waiter came over to check on us with the check. I congratulated them on the food and service. Our waiter was very nice and asked us if it was our first time eating there, we said yes. I told him we would differently eat here again. He said they also do take out, and said they have been in business for 25 years. I was amazed and told him they should be here another 25 more years. He also said there busy day is for lunch on Sundays. My overall experience was very nice, I will go back here!

Ordered takeout Thursday night, yummy..   I noticed the portion size from eat-in/take out was different. When you eat in, it seems like you get twice as much food, so note taken.. Food was awesome.. oh, and the chicken I ordered last time wasn't called Wonderful chicken, but " Amazing Chicken", hehe.. either way said, it was good...

Stopped in early Friday evening. The place as soon as I walked in seemed really clean and inviting. I got a little confused because they had a menu over the registers, so I thought it was like baja fresh where you order your food at the registers. My husband and I were drawn to walking right up to the counter when a waitress quickly walked up to us carrying menus and led us to a table to sit down, so I felt a little awkward.   The atmosphere was open and bright with all sorts of different clientele. We sat down and right away ordered two margarita's on the rocks. Shortly after a basket of chips and sides of salsa and warm beans were delivered to our table. Our margaritas were pretty good. I ordered the house Margarita instead of the top shelf brand. But the tequila was pretty good tasting. It wasn't a hit you in the face type of drink, but had very good flavor.   Menu's were given to us and we started looking at all the selection. Pretty nice mixture of fajitas, fish, meat, and poultry. I finally decided on ordering the carne asada cheese enchilada plate. We didn't have to wait very long before our meal was delivered. The portion size was pretty big for the prices, seems like the prices were around $8-$16 a plate. I looked around the restaurant and noticed a salsa bar, so I got up to get some and boo, all the salsa was gone. It was a empty bar. So I was kinda getting the picture of how maybe lunch is done??.. Walk up menu and salsa bar for lunch only. So I was a little disappointed at this point. I walked up to our waitress and asked for additional salsa, and she brought over the mild chunky salsa that was served with the chips earlier.   Our food was served, and I started carving into my meat and noticed it was very tough. I popped it into my mouth and it was as I thought very chewy. I did eat about half of it before I was done with it. The meat wasn't as favored as I like mine. I took a bite of my cheese enchilada and it was OK, I mean it really didn't have any flavor to it, and I couldn't taste any sauce at all on it. The plate had a huge helping of rice which I didn't get into, not all that impressed with fillers like that overwhelming my plate. I can say this I did feel stuffed by half the meal.   We had a 1/2 off coupon, buy one meal get one free, but honestly even with getting those coupons in the mail every week, I probably won't be back. It wasn't horrible tasting food, just bland for what I prefer.

$3 Movies in a Theater!! Yes you heard it right.   In this day and age, $3 a person to go watch a fairly recent movie is a steal. I went here with my husband and niece and nephew on a Friday night. I wasn't worried if the movie sucked or not cause hey the price is right! For all 4 of us $12, Sweet! Before the movies I took the kids to the dollar store to stock up on candy, but they do have all the candy, popcorn and drinks avail there at the theater also. I'm just cheap, lol.... We walked in late to our movie, so we had to just walk in the building, the ticket stand was closed, but a girl at the candy counter sold us tickets to get in.  Theaters were pretty clean, not the most comfortable, but I'm not expecting anything fancy for the low price offered. Movie was some kid alien movie which I thought sucked, but the kids had a ball of a time. I've also noticed a few movies are already on video and still playing at this theater.. I'll probably be back again, and again...

Oh My, Went to this place Christmas eve for a sandwich.  The parking lot was crazy full of people coming in and out, so I decided this was a great place to check out.  When I walked in, it was crazy busy.  Lots of people piled by the deli counter picking up their holiday meats and cheeses.  I just came for lunch, so I sorta cut the line and went strait to the sandwich ordering station.  It was confusing though to figure out where to go with so many people in line.    I ordered a sandwich with 3 meats on it to split with my husband. We got a monster drink and a regular soda, and some chips.  Total was pretty cheap like $12-$13 bucks.  We walked over to where the tables were to wait for our meal.  Watching all the shoppers was differently a spectacle.  Also we had time to check the place out.  It's really casual and has racks of Italian items for sale, such as hard to find wines, pasta's and freshly baked breads.    Our meal came out hand delivered in a basket, and the guy delivering was kind enough to ask me if I wanted another basket for my portion to be put in.  I thought it was really sweet of him to ask, because the place was a zoo, and just having to go past all the shoppers must have been a hassle.  But he came back with a huge smile but a minute later.  I took a huge bite of the sandwich, and wow, it was really good.  You could actually tell the quality of meats and cheeses in the sandwich along with some good dressing that came dripping out of my sub sandwich.  It was a huge sandwich and I was glad I only got half, but only wished we had ordered another one for dinner.  Yes it was that good.  But I didn't want to wait in line again.  Good Stuff....Wish this place was closer to my house.

Stopped in for lunch on Sunday.  I had never been to Four Peaks before but have driven by it and seen how busy and opted to go somewhere else due to lack of parking.  We were lucky to have found a spot about a block away so we decided to check out the place.  It was a hot muggy day and we thought some nice cold beers would hit the spot.  We arrived at the front of the place to see about five people standing around at the hostess spot, not one of them said Hi.  I had to say two please and interrupt their conversation.  We got seated in the back and right away the heat just hit me when I sat down.  I started sweating.  No ac, really?  We are in phoenix and people still use swamp coolers?  Anyways I was uncomfortable and noticed everyone was sweating, like beast. I looked around and saw a lot of college students sitting about and thought to myself... geez this isn't where I would go to pick up on someone, everyone is sweating and looks gross.   I know this place has some good reviews but nothing stuck out to me.  I love four peaks beers normally, but when my server came with my beer it was warm, not refreshing when sitting and sweating.  Food was average, typical bar food. Our server was ok for it being so busy, but I didn't get the warm and fuzzies with her attitude. Wonder if this review will be axed by yelp?? hmm..

Had an excellent time Saturday night here to see Jim Breuer.  Ticket prices were nice to see a popular headliner, even with a 2 drink minimum. Place was easy to find. Seats for us was fabulous.. (center stage).  It was a great night out, only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because even with prepaid tickets we had to wait in line just to be seated.  When it's over 105 out and a scare of rain I didn't like being stuck outside in a hot and sweaty line for 30 minutes.  Service came around only once to take our drink orders and suggested to buy both drinks at once, which was a good suggestion, cause I never saw him again. Drink prices not on menu, and a little overpriced, but I weighed that out to the cheap ticket prices and felt it was a fair price to pay.  Show was fun, place was clean and it was awesome that Jim stuck around afterwords for a meet and greet with fans.  I will differently be coming back.

Had a Wonderful time this weekend staying here Friday and Saturday night! Man.. all I can say is we partied!! Stayed here with a couple of friends in a room with double beds. We've stayed here before since the rooms have been renovated, very nice and classy. Look on there website to get a 360 view, pretty nice for such a cheap place in downtown. The bathroom is small, but seriously who stays in the hotel that long to bitch about the bathroom size.   If you don't have roaming internet, you won't find it free here, my friend checked into it, it's like $50 a day.. C-R-A-Z-Y, but I did notice a starbucks down the main freemont street not to far away if you must stay plugged in..  I would recommend to get there B-connect card and hand it to them when you gamble. I really didn't gamble too much last February when I stayed there maybe a total of 2 hours or something, and only lost like $30 dollars, but did get two nights free.. pretty sweet deal! I like that this casino has free valet for guest, and you don't have to do any driving down to the main strip. You can just party right down in the old Vegas, everything is in walking distance.. The table's are cheap to gamble and the staff are super friendly. I'd stay here again!!

Went to the Nugget over the passed weekend for a friends wedding and stayed to party...    I never stayed here before, but was really surprised on how clean my room was for $39 a night.  When I was helping my friend check in they were cleaning her carpets, when I went to check in they just finished changing my filter on my a/c...  Not to shabby of a room... I mean I had a huge flat screen TV, granite and tile bathroom..  I felt I should be paying more...   Plus all guest get access to an awesome pool area.  They have a live shark/fish aquarium that has a water slide that goes right through it..  They offer lounge chairs, a hot tub, pool side bar, seriously what else can you ask for.  Yes the casino part is all old and ranky, but that's ol' Vegas baby.   I did get to see the wedding chapel and for what my friend paid for her services it was a steal.  Very elegant and formal feel.  Also an after party was in a suite and can I tell you, I felt like I was walking in the Tony Montana's house in Scarface, really HOT!  The suite had a jacuzzi tube, double story loft vibe, dramatic curvy staircase,a steam shower, baday(I totally know I spelled that wrong, but whatever) , full party bar stocked with glasses, nice loud stereo totally staying there next time I go..  For reals though... don't pay the high prices on the strip, get a bargin and stay here.. I was really impressed.

Ghetto Fab...   It's a tiny casino, no card tables, crammed full of people, waitresses are outgoing, drinks are filled super fast. I don't play slots, so I wonder why I always end up here??? hummmm, I think the free beads draw me in, and I always end up talking with the craziest people.. I've always had a good time coming here, this is my third time this year! Yes, it's pretty old, but hey it is in the old Vegas, if your expecting glitz and glam go to the strip and pay a lot more to be stuck in boring-ville.

Went to Vegas to meet some friends last weekend.  I've stayed in downtown Vegas numerous times and knew to expect an older casino.  Booked our hotel room at Fitzgerald's on Expedia.com and got the room for super cheap.  $55 bucks a night w/free breakfast for a Friday and Saturday night stay.  I was happy with the price of the room.  We arrived late Friday night.  Got the room key to be disappointed as soon as we arrived in the room.  We had booked  a king size bed online.  We called the front desk right away to request a room transfer and the front desk said they are sold out of king size rooms.  My husband is 6'8" and can't fit on a queen size bed so we were pretty upset.  My husband asked for a refund or credit and right away the front desk said they weren't able to do that.  We were bummed.  Room was super old and dingy, dark and uninviting.  Internet service was an extra $11 a day for WiFi.  And I didn't have very good cell service inside the hotel.  TV looked about 20 years old and had limited channels to watch.  Made sure I checked for bed bugs because the place looked sketchy (none found).   Location of this casino is excellent right in the middle of old downtown Vegas Fremont Street.  So close you could hear the party from inside your room as if you were outside parting all night with everyone else.  So if you like sleep don't stay here.  Also walls in the hotel are super thin, we heard conversations all around us from other rooms and hallways.   Prices at the tables were cheap, but I did notice the display board on the roulette table was broken not letting you see previous ball landings.  Waitresses all night never asked if anyone in our group wanted a drink, after 3 hours we left the tables because we needed something to drink.  Our group headed upstairs to the bar and we were ignored by the bartender.  We sat playing the bar slots for a  few minutes noticed the bartender look at us and started a nagging session with another server instead of greeting anyone in our party.  Got the feeling both were unhappy with there jobs.   Bar was super empty with only two other people at it and wasn't sure if they had been served or not either.   Annoyed by the lack of customer service I went to the pit boss downstairs to complain about the service we received.  Pit boss had me fill out a written one page form explaining what happened.  Pit boss said sorry but that was it.  For the remainder of the weekend I refused to spend another dollar in the casino, I took my money elsewhere and will never stay or play their again.  By the end of the weekend my lungs really hurt from the lack of filtration from the smoking in the casino.  Pay a little extra and go to the golden nugget or Fremont casino to stay.  Way better service and cleaner accommodations.

Top of the Mornin'  Popped in over the weekend while looking for a place to eat, our group wanted to eat at Capo's but we didn't know you have to make reservations in advanced, cause it sells out. Our group sneaked in this quite retreat and enjoyed our time away from the hustle and buss ell of Vegas.   The atmosphere is very chill, and relaxing. We talked with some other tourist and had a friendly conversation.  We ordered a fish and chip happy hour snack for $2.99 and was happy with the food quality. Our bartender lady was nice and recommended a great place for Italian food.

Pretty dang good food here!   Called a little a head of time to make reservations that night. We pulled up to a strip mall, next to a bowling store.. OK so the outside wasn't fancy, but as soon as you get in the doors you understand why people aren't scared to return. The interior is decorated very upscale, except for the white paper table cloths. Our party walked in around 6pm and the place was packed, already people waiting for tables to be seated.. As soon as you enter the restaurant a wall of deli shes garlic smells make your mouth water. As we waited the few minutes, we got to enjoy watching the cooks, cook in the kitchen, which is placed right in the middle of the restaurant. We got seated near the bar and got to watch all the locals sit down and wind down. It looked like they had some fancy martini's if your into that kind of stuff..   As soon as we sat down we were served a huge bowl of garlic bread, no extra cost. And they didn't skimp at all, I mean this was a huge basket of really yummy garlic bread. Our wait staff was on their game this evening, filling glasses of water, and refilling the garlic bread basket a few times. We also ordered a small salad for an app. The salad was no where near small, it feed the four of us.   We all ordered our food, someone got chicken Marsala's, another got the lasagna, and I got the Alfredo Carbon. The portion sizes where huge, and the food was great! We all had enough leftovers for a second meal, which we nicely boxed up. Nicely done Nora's! Still feeling stuffed! :)

No, not a fan at all. I gave this place two stars just because it kinda reminded me of going to chuck e cheeses with some of my wonderful childhood memories.. A lot of furry creatures moving around making noises and horrible food. My husband ordered a burger meal, and I ordered some beef wrap. Like someone said below, Apple bee's is a better bet for this type of bar food. This place would be rad if you were a little kid, but I will never eat here again..   Oh and the food is way overpriced. The two of us ate with tip for like $40, they charge you extra for their dry french fries 99cents, and a side salad $3.99.

Went to Fez's last night as a work get together.  Company paid for the goods, so you know I'm taking advantage of that.   It was a Tuesday night and when I walked in the place had a very stylish and hip vibe.  I felt very comfortable in my cocktail dress attire from our Christmas party at work.  My work reserved a whole table and it was decked out with all sorts of apps, including the hummus/pita selections, different flat bread style pizza's and of course an open bar for our table...me likey...  Our waiter was very friendly and came over quickly to greet everyone and take our drink orders as we started dragging in.  As I opened the bar menu I started giggling at some of the drink names, pretty cute...  To some it up I ordered the bitch Merlot.  It was good.  Now the ambiance was very mellow and relax, which I liked.  The food was so so, I tried the margarita looking flat bread  pizza, blah boring.  I did try a Mediterranean style flat bread which was really good.  The hummus was bland, I kinda like mine with some spice so I didn't double dip that.  Overall the place was a nice little surprise for being so busy on a Tuesday night.

This is "OLD SCHOOL VEGAS"   Stayed here last Friday and Saturday night. We had a huge party of people and someone had reserved a whole floor for everyone to reserve their rooms and we would all be by each other, so we would be able to all meet and party from room to room. We all had our reservations in from about a month ago.   When we went to check in the hotel, the party was all split up all over the north and south towers, all on different floors. I know of one reservation that was canceled all together from the hotel, and they had a hard time getting a room. Also my husband and I reserved a room with a King size bed, and we ended up with a room with two double beds in it, oh well.   This hotel is very old, and very cheap to stay at. My room was very run down, the bedding was from the 80's, and the airconditoner sounded as if it were a loud generator. I was happy it worked, because one of my friends said she stayed in the same hotel a couple of weeks prior and she had got a room where it didn't work at all. So my husband and I were not going to complain.   The floors were a different matter all together. Our carpet was full of stains and super gross to look at, we didn't even dare taking our shoes off walking around in there. The hotel elevators were a fear factor challenge. A couple of times we felt the cables slipping and the elevators to the parking garage smelt like vomit. All and all be prepared this is no 5 star hotel. I will not be staying in this hotel again... I gave this hotel two stars, just because I didn't see any bugs, or murders. Motel 6 is a one star I'd rate against this hotel. A nice thing about the hotel is the location. It's right at the end of Fremont street walking distance from everything downtown.--- that was cool, we didn't have to drive anywhere.. oh and the hotel management didn't say anything to our party about being two loud..which was cool.... and it was loud!

My review is similar to Andy G.'s...  My husband and I wanted to try this place for ever.  We always noticed from the outside it looks super busy so thought it might be a really cool place to hang and get some good drinks and food...   We decided to go on a Friday evening around 7pm.  We were super hungry and thought we need to finally go here.   We after fighting with traffic and trying to find a parking spot for a good half hour finally stepped foot into the place.  Right away the place was packed as soon as we walked in.  No wait service noticed we looked lost and attempted to help us find a spot to sit.  We roamed around for another good 15 minutes and decided to skip this place.   Finally when we were walking out the door someone noticed us and said they have room upstairs to sit.  By this time we were hungry and said that sounds good.  She escorts us up stairs and it's a tiny little empty space with two people up there.   All the action was downstairs and I felt really cut off from the whole vibe of the place being upstairs, the waitress took our drink orders then we waited, and waited.  It had to have been over 20 minutes before we got our beer.  During that time we looked over the menu and noticed it didn't have many choices. Not feeling impressed by this place, I didn't want to order a meal and have to wait another half hour or longer for food.   We took off.   I won't return, not worth the time it takes to #1 deal with the traffic, #2 find parking, #3 find a spot to sit and order, #4 get placed in the kiddy room on the second floor, oh and I didn't mention #5 horrible early 80's rock----(I like some 80"s rock, but this was the bad stuff)

Went here Saturday night with my hubby, nothing special about this place.  We were looking for a casual sit down place to have a late lunch/dinner.  We remember seeing this places BBQ sauce in stores, so thought they might have some tasty food.  We got there and we had to wait ten minutes to be seated in the bar.  They had some flat screen TVs to watch but the place was super noisy... we could hardly talk to each other even sitting in the same booth.  We both ordered different dishes... I ordered the catfish with some fries and a side of beans.  My husband got the two meat combo, which he got the brisket and something else, they kinda tasted the same though.   We got our food and it was pretty bland, I guess that's why they have like 5 or 6 different BBQ sauces located on the table for you.  We tasted all of them and wasn't impressed.  The Devil's spit that was supposed to be the hottest one was mild, weird...   My fried catfish had a soggy crust on the outside, but the side of beans were pretty good.    We probally won't come back, due to no flavor... it didn't work for me...

First thing, Beer, mmm it's good to have so many choices in one place.  I love the atmosphere when you walk into the place they have a clear glass viewing room to see all the Kegs.  You literally see hundreds of these babies locked down and ready to share in pure awesomeness.  I've been here at least three times in the past six months and my all time favorite is the ECLIPSE, black and tan with  * Blue Moon & Guinness Stout. Yeah it's kinda the bomb.  Anyways whatever kind of beer you like, except malt liquor is avail here.  I've tried the pizza, it was alright but nothing I'd order again, but the truffle fries are so good.  I did order those for dinner once by themselves, and will do it again thinking about it now.  Just a warning though, check your bill, sometimes they include gratuity already.

Nope, this club has gone way Downhill within that last couple of years.  Due to the location of the club is really the only reason I came here.  Friends feel like dancing and want to go to this club.  This will be the last time going for sure though.  This club is super ghetto.  Tons of security they have is needed. I'm not stuck up at all but it's a freaking dirty meat fest up in there.  I can't believe they even charge a cover, which they do.  DJ/Music is horrible.  I like to dance and will dance to almost anything when drunk, but I even had to sit out.  The one time my friends forced me onto the dance floor made me feel super uncomfortable because I felt like I was going to get raped. I'm so not kidding, guys stared you down like it was feeding time in the tiger cage at the zoo.  All the touching and rubbing on me made me leave right away.  I'm not down for getting impregnated while trying to dance here. Guys that went with us felt just as uncomfortable as the ladies did.  If I had to sum this up in one word I would have to say, Terrifying!

Restaurant has a hip and clean atmosphere. I was seated right away with a very friendly waitress, that was very patient and came around a couple of times while I read the menu.  It was hard to decide what to order because their was so much selection, which is awesome! In the middle of your table they have an inset grill. I looked over to the table on my left to notice a party of four having fun grilling up their meat on it, it did smell great.  I also noticed a tv by the bar that had cute pictures displaying photos of their signature sushi dishes. I wanted to try everything after seeing some of the art of these dishes, everything looked so good. I was in the mood for some sushi.  Well finally I ordered the spicy tuna roll off of the signature menu, and my husband ordered 3 different rolls off of the traditional. We also ordered an appetizer of an egg roll.   The egg rolls were so yummy, we scarfed them down.  Then the sushi started rolling out.  Wow we ordered a ton of food. I really liked everything.  My two favorites were the signature spicy tuna roll, and the tradition Salomon roll.  All was excellent though. We will be making this our new favorite sushi stop.  Next time I want to try a hot dish, just because everyone else's food smelled so great.

I love burgers, I mean who doesn't, maybe except vegetarians?  My husband and I decided to go out and get a burger, we were up in the happy valley area on our way to dick's sporting goods, so we droped in here to fulfill our burger urges. They have so many to choose from it takes a few minutes to get through the menu. They also offer and endless amount of french fries and refills.   I can't remember what the name of the burger was I ordered, but I can tell you it had guac, and Bacon on it. The burgers can be ordered two different ways, pink or not pink. It seems like this place is really flexible on how the meals can be ordered. They do have on the menu I think one burger without bun, but you can order any burger they have "protein style". I ordered mine "protein style" which just means instead of a bun you have your's wrapped in lettuce. Also I substituted the endless fries with a side order of a salad. We didn't wait very long before being served our meals.  Once I got my burger and salad I macked it down.. It was pretty good. I gave this place 4 stars instead of 3 because of the flexibility in their menu.

OK, went here last Friday on 7.24.09 for lunch. Got there around 11:50, thought I'd beat the lunch crowd to sit and eat. I had never tried this place but have driven past it a few times. Well we pulled up to this detached building, from outside it had a bit of charm to it, all brick with a huge outdoor patio/bar area. We walked in and again the building had a nice charm to it. But at this point I started noticing all the details that started looking more of a taco shop instead of a restaurant. I waited near the door for a couple of minutes before a waitress noticed I was waiting to be seated. She said go ahead and find a spot, so we did. We sat inside cause it was insanely hot outside.  We sat down and waited for someone to come by to order drinks or get a menu, and we waited and waited. About 5 minutes later our waitress comes by. She said she'll be right back. Still without menus and waiting we looked around at everyone else waiting as well. I'll give them this, there was a huge grove of office people all sitting at one table but there where two or three waitress for a tiny little restaurant. So finally our waitress fly's by us and throws us one menu, I guess to share? After the menu, a bowl of chips and salsa come our way. Well let me tell you this, the chips were the bottom of the bag, cause the chips were broken up so much we couldn't even us them to dip into the salsa. We were starting to get hungry so we started eating the crumbs.   OK so by this time we take a look at the fast lunch menu, so we could get back to work on time. We picked out our selection really quick, but again had to wait until our waitress wanted to stop by. Finally she came by, after I think the manager saw we were getting irritated. She took our food and drink orders finally. Well I ordered the Traditional Burrito w/carne asada, and my husband ordered the carne asasa chimmy combo. Well we got our food after 20 minutes. We noticed people that came in after us were getting served even before us.  We asked for some hot sauce and they brought back the same salsa as with the chips, which wasn't hot at all, just mild. We started eating the burritos and they were "OK". The sign outside said traditional Mexican food. Well it tasted like TeX Mex to me.   After lunch was done we waited for our check, and waited. The waitress had come around once to say she will be right back with the check, but after 10 minutes or so of waiting we got up and went to the front of the restaurant were she was putting in a new order on the computer. I gave a nasty look to her, and wala, a check was handed to us. We paid and left upset with this experience. The only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star is because my food was eatable.

Went to Vegas last weekend and stayed at this Hotel.  I was a little worried after reading a few reviews on here but thought I'd give it a try.  All the rooms at the major casino's were going for $199 and up, and they had a room for 79 bucks a night, price was right!  I'll start with the cons just cause there was only a couple...  Cons-  Tub didn't want to drain Had to run across the street to get a taxi. (we were meeting friends at a different hotel not Harrah's where the free shuttle goes.) Parking a little tight  Pro's-  up to two dogs free (didn't bring my dogs to this hotel, but nice to know) free breakfast 24/7 free shuttle to/from Harrah's Casino on the strip 24/7 free shuttle to/from airport Free Wifi clean cheap comfortable bed fast check-in friendly staff surrounding area not as bad as I was expecting  rooms quiet throughout the night

Pretty Cool Pub!   Right at the end of the Fremont experience you'll find this Irish Pub at the corner. Our group stumbled into this place and kicked backed while watching an Irish live band. People were dancing to Irish folk music, the beer was flowing. I think my favorite is when they did covers of the devil went down to Georgia, and they covered pink Floyd, we don't need no education. It was awesome, they put their Irish Roots into the covers with fiddles and tambourines, very cool. Everyone in the pub was in good spirits. Only downfall was the drinks were a little pricey for shots and beers, compared to the specials down the strip. And a few of our souvenir cups where quickly picked up by wait staff and thrown away when we weren't looking. But all and all we had a nice time hanging out here..

Perfect venue for touring punk bands. This place is a little small, but it makes the atmosphere more cosy. Don't get me wrong, this is a dingy bar, but the people working there are super friendly. I was lucky enough to see Jello perform with his new band. I mean I was so excited to be able to be front of the stage inches from an icon. At other venues you wouldn't be so fortunate. Yes people still stage dive and they're slam pits so if your not into that kind of stuff stay towards the bar area to watch your band. Place is dark, nowhere except the bar to sit, unless you don't mind the ground.  I gave this place a 4 star instead of a 5 star, just because they charge you a convince fee for tickets, like $3, really.. it's a freakin bar. Also because I couldn't find this place for the life of me. I map quested it and everything. It's in a strip mall hidden location for anyone who's never been there before.   No one was outside so I kept driving passed it.. Map quest was way wrong... Had to stop into a few stores to ask for directions.. Anyway, show was awesome, venue perfect for this type of show.

Father-in law was in town and felt like some seafood. I thought nowhere better to take this out of town-er than Pappadeaux's.. My husband and I have eaten a few times here for lunch and everytime it's been out of control good. We arrived friday night, no waiting needed.   We sat in the back and ordered drinks, and a medium size gator app, yes as in alligator. My margarita was very sweet, felt like they added a cup of sugar in it, and it came in a fu/fu glass. The gator was good, but too small for three people.  Wait staff was very nice and explained that the fish flys in fresh daily, and went into detail of the dishes we were going to order. I ordered the Marti Gra.. My husband and his dad got some seafood array?? not sure of the name.. but it looked good. My main dish came and woohoo... it was slammin good. It had crawfish, sausage, shrimp over a bed of creamy pasta.. it was so good, I could only eat 1/4 of the bowl. The portion sizes are pretty big. By the way there bread is baked daily and is so good, they serve a loaf of it for an app, if you eat the whole thing you can ask for another. (Very Good stuff)   Anyways.. always fantastic food, if you have visitors from out of town that like seafood I would recommend this place... Lunch is cheaper, around $12-16 a plate.. Dinner from $15-35.

Stopped in for some lunch last Saturday.  Place was pretty packed because of the BBQ Fest that was going on the same day.  That being said we did get seated right away.  This place had such an inviting atmosphere.  Super laid back and a great selection of beer.  They had an open patio bar which was nice to take advantage of the great weather and people watching.   I ordered the Club, and my husband ordered a pork dish.  I must say portions were huge and super tasty!  My club had thick chunks of turkey breast that tasted so juicy and right.  I would order that ten times over, yummy.  I also tried my husbands pork, and let me tell you, it was lip smacking good.  It came with a side of this pineapple habanero sauce that was kick-in! Beer was super good, and prices spot on for quality and service received.  Whenever in the area, I'll be back!

My husbands truck needed a cleaning after some really messy Off Roading.  We decided to go on a Sunday and get the VIP package.. it's a $20 dollar wash supposedly with all the upgrades like interior cleaning and bottom of car wash.  Wait was horrible.. Truck was so dirty on the outside they actually put it through the wash a second time which was nice.  After waiting 40 minutes for our car and seeing hardly any staff touch the inside we were sick of waiting in 110+ weather and were called up by staff alerting us the car was ready.  We got in and drove off without inspection.  Big mistake! We got home and the carpets were not cleaned and still dust all over the inside, you could tell no one cleaned it.  I felt ripped off and ended up going to a cheapo car wash down the street for 3 bucks for a wash and free vacuuming the next week.  Car looked better by me putting in the work.. Don't waste your money on the VIP, totally not worth the wait or price.

Stopped in after buying a groupon.  Food is way overpriced.  I had a $20 groupon and only got two sandwiches (no sides), and two drinks.  I also splurged and got a piece of pecan pie.  Total rang up with me still owing $15 bucks. $35 bucks for two sandwiches and a piece of pie is a little ridiculous.   Food was ok.  It was hot and the restaurant area didn't have any air conditioning.  We sat out in the grassy picnic area which was nice but it was still hot.  Food was ok, but a little dry.

Visited this restaurant on Sunday 7.12.09 around 2pm for lunch. I walked into the place and saw a little bit of a difference in lighting from other PF Chang's I've been to. They actually had their curtains open to let in some natural light, which was really nice. You could see the place was clean and it gave the atmosphere a more of a casual vibe. I enjoy eating at places where it's a little more personable with the wait staff, which wasn't the case this afternoon. The wait staff on this afternoon wasn't focused on the customer, which was me. It seemed like a young crowd of wait staff that didn't want to work a Sunday afternoon. I didn't see any genuine smiles from them. They had the attitude of blah, blah blah, here's your food, bye. I ordered the peppercorn beef dish, and my husband ordered the kung pow dish extra spicy. For an app we had 4 spring rolls. The app didn't taste fresh, and the sweet and sour sauce served with it was bland. Our meals were a decent size but low on sauce for some reason. The rice was a little dry. And my husband's extra spicy kung pow didn't have any pow at all. So at this point I was asking myself, why eat here? I could have gone to any neighborhood Chinese place and have gotten the same quality of food with paying 1/2 the price.. I'm really considering being a little stuck up saying that these chain restaurants are expected to have a certain standard, and why can't they go above it to empress me to come back? I think in this type of economy I'm really going to start to eat at the more mom and pop places where you can feel the heart and soul that is put in the dinning experience. I probably am not going to go back to this chain because of this experience.

Stereo typical verson of an Irish pub.  Lots of Guinness signs and friendly staff.  Went here last Friday night to meet up with some friends.  Nice thing about this place is they have a lot of room, both inside and out. Pretty much across from the spring training facility it was pretty packed with baseball fans when we went here.  We decided to park it outside because the weather was perfect and we noticed a rock band setting up gear for some live music.  We sat at the bar and placed our Guinness orders.  Looking around everyone seemed really chilled out which was nice and relaxing.  We ordered some apps, some Guinness wings and a chicken quesadilla.  The band started and was a bit out of tune, but did play some classic songs that where good.  Later that evening a member of the band came and told me they were just getting started and this was there 5th practice, so I totally understood the out of sync part of it.   But even that they weren't too bad.  Our food came and let me tell you, for apps, they were huge, and soo yummy!  The wings were top notch, big juicy and had an awesome sauce.  The chicken quesadilla was really fresh tasting and had huge chucks of jalapeno in, mmmm, mmm good.. I enjoyed our food a lot.  Would differently come back and try other things on the menu as well.  Our Guinness drafts were $5.50 a piece pretty reasonable price and the apps for the size and quality were a steal at between, $8-$12 each.  We had a lot of food, buy the end of the night we were trying to give it away.  We left a little faded, but our belly's were full...  :)

Sorry, don't agree with most of ya yelpers on this place.   I wanted to stop by this place for awhile, so Sunday I took the trip down here to see what some of the fuss was all about. Cheap good food drew me in, and I'm a sucker for fish tacos. I drove up to this place thinking yes, this does look like a hippies house, with all the misc. crap placed all over the walls, ceilings and windows. I wouldn't say it had much of the beach vibe I think they were going for, or maybe it's just me, I have lived most of my life in San Diego and near the Beach, and most little beach shacks I've been to have a different vibe to them.   On the board it said something like famous fish taco's or something like that. I thought oh yes then, got to try those.. I really don't know why I insist to challenge my gut feeling of "don't order the fish taco's, your in the middle of the freakin desert, there is no ocean for hundreds of miles", but no.. I had to order them. Taco's were cheap, like $2 a piece.   The guy working at the counter that took our order was super friendly, he took the time to ask us how are day was going and what have we been up to and stuff. We waited about five minutes and our order was up. While waiting I was looking around at all the mess that was placed everywhere, and was wondering how this tied into there "theme".   And I wonder how long it's been since this place has gotten a good scrub, or at least a dusting???  OK, our order was up, and we sat in the back on some picnic benches. It was hot, but they did have a huge fan that made it bearable to sit back there. We opened up our fish taco's and noticed, wow these are huge! They piled all sorts of stuff in there.. cabbage, rice, ton's of cheese, fish, some sort of secret sauce, all on a flour, kinda thick shell (taste like the mission brand).   Grabbed the taco with both hands and bit into the taco. Blahhhh, it was the fish.. Oh man, the fish killed it.. taste so fishy and soggy it was gross. Next, don't ask me why I did it, but I thought I'd try it again. So I poured the red hot sauce they had given on it and tried it again.. Blahhhh, gross, gross, gross. The sauce didn't help at all. There sauce had no heat to it, and the fish was just as bad as the first bite. I had bought two taco's, and looked in back of me, and there were two guys in there 20's macking down on taco's, and I offered them our taco's we didn't eat. They said, no man.. where good. So I couldn't even give these away for free..   We drove off grossed out, and I had this fishy taste in my mouth for about 20 minutes before I had to stop and get something else to eat to get the taste out. Soda wasn't doing the trick. I remember saying to my husband in the car driving off, I don't feel good, I think I'm going to puke.. really my stomach hurt, and in no way do I have a sensitive stomach. Like others had said, I really did want to like this place, but no way I'll ever ever return. Sorry..

Yes I did vote this with a five star! It is the best fast food Mexican joint on the West side of Phoenix. When I want fast food Mexican carne asada burritos I come here! It's not the closest Mexican shop to my house, but dang it, when I moved out to phoenix, you know I tried to hit every Mexican shop I could to try and find the best flavored carne asada meat. And this was the best I could find.   I come here at least once or twice a month. I always get one of two people that are working the same drive through window. The price's are down right awesome for the quality of food you get. The red hot sauce reminds me of home, it's not firey hot but gives the food a wonderful taste. If your a So-Cal native and miss your Mexican food try here, it's not exactly the same but it will fill that void we all have. "Cheers Polibertos!!"

This place is way tasty!!!  I ordered the shrimp Po Boy and some Jambalaya.  I wasn't aware the sandwich came with a side order of your choice.....I got the red beans and rice...   The bread the sandwich comes on is so fluffy and fresh, the shrimp are crusted with panko I believe.  The shrimp and fixings are super fresh tasting too.  I will definitely be coming back.  I gave a 4 stars out of 5 just because I was craving a Muffaletta and it wasn't even on the menu, and also for them being closed on a Sunday.  I drove a distance and didn't know that they would be closed on a Sunday, so I was a little upset about that.  But set that aside and the staff was friendly and the food top notch.  Try it out it's good stuff.

Went here Saturday Morning around 9:30ish... Trust me a good time to eat here.. I've been to this place at earlier times and it gets really busy. This place isn't that big, but wow is the plate sizes. Crazy amount of food for a fair price.   Picture the show: Man vs. Food, this is otto's with every dish they put out..  I ordered the Chirzo Burrito, and my husband ordered the Machaca Plate. We both ordered coffee. The coffee was nice and strong, really woke us up that morning. The service was right on que, filling our cups numerous times, so we got pretty wired before our food came out.   When our food came out we dug in.. oh yeah, that's what I'm talkin about.   My Chirzo burrito was freakin huge, and the meat, potato's, and sauce was really good. There's just something about Otto's Potato's that are my favorite.. They taste so fresh so perfect. Ok, this may sound weird but I've eaten here before and just ordered a side of potato's, I know.. that's really bad, lol.. but they are deli sh..   I only got about half of my burrito eaten before I thought I was going to burst. My husband meal was huge also.. I took a few bites of his, and it was good to. I think next time I come back though I'm going to stick with a morning classic dish, with some eggs, potato's (of course) and an English Muffin's are so good too, lots o' butter).   All I can say is:  "Get in my Belly"

Love Camp Bow Wow Las Vegas!  I have dropped off my dogs a few times here and have nothing but positive experiences with Camp Bow Wow. I hate to leave my dogs so far away from me when I travel so I was happy that I could drop them off and not have to worry about them the entire weekend.  I knew they were having a fun time as well.  Staff is super friendly and my dogs run into the back room without even looking back to say goodbye when I drop them off.  They also have webcams so you can check on your dogs if your having withdraws from seeing them.  When I come back they look so happy and are worn out from playing with all their friends all day.  It's a vacation for them too!

This place has it all. I mean everything I was looking for. I own a kayak, and play disc golf, so they have a nice selection of accessories for both sports. I even got some really cool add on's to my kayak I haven't seen at any other stores in town. If you like camping you'll find a good selection here also. The prices are fair but they are retail prices. Dick's does have a buyers club you can join to earn points for gift cards, it's worth filling out, sporting goods add up fast and I know I've gotten a few gift certificates in the mail from it already. They also have a nice selection of camping stuff. All the little Nick nacs. Just try and stay focused while shopping here, I know I went in here for one thing, and ended up with a cart full of stuff.

Had an excellent brunch Sunday.  Just a warning the wait is a long and I was one of the lucky ones that found a seat inside to wait. I did notice a lot of people waiting outside in the heat for well over a half an hour.   Service staff was super friendly and our server Michael had stopped in several times checking if I needed anything which was nice cause the place was packed.  Got the number 3 lo lo's combo with chicken and waffles, opted for all white meat which was a couple of dollars extra.  Chicken and waffles were perfect! Portion sizes are huge, I only got about 1/3rd down, and took the rest home for dinner.  Very good food here, I probably will only come back once or twice a year though cause it's such naughty food.  I will take visitors here for a splurge though!

Had lunch today here.. oh yeah, big ol' ham and cheese sandwich... It was way better then subways, and Quinoz.. at least the ones near my house anyways.  The shop was nice and clean, a little busy because it was lunchtime, but the workers were on their game and made those sandwiches pretty fast to get me back to work on time.  They had a special that is crazy.. 2 feet of sandwich, any cold ones for $9.99. So I split the cost and got a whole foot long for like $5. It's not the wimpy ones at other $5 foot long deals.. It was huge, had all the fixings, and I could only eat half of it.. So oh yeah, you know what I'm having for supper... MMMM... Can't Wait! good food, meat and cheese were nice and fresh, they didn't skimp on the toppings... good deal, I'll be back..

Went to this place over the weekend and was amazed by how packed it has become.  I've eaten here previously when I think it was owned by different people.  The food back then doesn't compared with what the foods like now.    Wow, for a buffet there is a lot of selection.  They have a raw sushi bar with someone preparing it right in front of you.  They have a good selection of Chinese food with the classic dishes that's everyone's favorite.   Along with that they have different seafood selections with Crab Legs, all you can eat..  I'm not a big crab leg eater, but people around me were bringing back piles and piles back with numerous servings of plates.  My dishes were a mix of different items, and all were good.  For desert they have ice cream and some other sweets to choose from.  I picked the ice cream and it was yummy.  Tasted like Thrifty's Ice Cream to me..     Price is cheap, and I have gone back a few times.  Every time I go back it seems more crowded, even a short wait if you have a large party.  But worth it if you have to wait.

Best Museum in Phoenix hands down!   I didn't know what to expect when walking in this huge museum but was super excited once I started exploring around.  Downstairs starts off with some vintage guitars from around the world.  Once upstairs your self guided with the help of headphones that changes from section to section when you walk up to each exhibit. They also have videos in the exhibits showing how the people use each instrument being heard, and some showed how the instruments were made. Over 10,000 instruments from around the world spanning from Air Guitar (yes I said it) to everything you can't imagine that makes noise. They have the museum so organized it was fun to go from country to country getting samples of the different types of music to actually hear the instruments being shown.  I went and spent a couple of hours before closing time, and still didn't get to see everything.  I would suggest to wear comfortable shoes and allow at least three hours to experience everything.  I'll be back to explore the areas I didn't get to visit in the future.  A must see museum.

Good Burger, taste like a homemade burger off the grill.  Fries are good, just make sure if there is two of you to order one small fry and share, it's quite large.  Burger comes with whatever you tell them from a list of items.. Good selection and good food.

Love this place, food is very well portioned, and yummy.  I really love the endless selection of bottled drinks offered.  Must try if your craving a soda different from the normal selections offered.  But, they do have the standby soda selections available as well.  Stop in, burgers have some crazy combinations to try.

Yum-E, Great BBQ Joint.. Went today to the restaurant for lunch. I had purchased a Groupon for a discount and thought it sounded to good to pass up.  The restaurant is kinda hidden in a business building area, but just look for the signs near the road it's not terribly hard to find.  Hours are limited Mon-Fri closing at 3pm so unfortunately you can't stop by for dinner.      I walked into the place and it was filled with the sweet smells of smoking meat.  With my mouth watering  I ordered the smokin' deal.  It had a smoked sausage, a pulled pork sandwich, and a brisket cut on a bun, which came with two sides.  For $10 bucks for lunch not a bad deal for all that.  The food came out pretty fast and while I was waiting bumped into a fellow yelper who was proud of this restaurant find.  Myself I couldn't wait to dig in.  It was very tender and fresh tasting.  I'm very glad this place isn't very far from my home, but I must find out where these farmer markets they go to on the weekend are. A+ place

Stopped in to taste some local beer and take a tour last Saturday.  Beer was super good, was bummed the porter was out.  It was really hot outside and this place hit the spot.  Had a sampler of beers on tap and decided with the hot weather the Honey Wheat took my favorite of the current selection, so of course had to have a couple more fills.  Staff is so friendly here and are willing to go out of the way to help and entertain you as you get your drink on.  Our bartender made us fill laid back and at ease... Nice way to spend an afternoon.  Place is a little bare but the ease and friendliness of the staff pushed it above other places in town.  I was bummed they were out of growlers when we went but it just gave me another excuse to go back and get one another weekend. Also liked the fact this place is on the West side of town, now I don't need to drive all the way to Tempe for some local crafted beer..  Yay for that!

Warning, Do Not go here!! Went here with a group of friends Halloween weekend.  Our group paid the cover charge to get in, they had advertised on facebook that women are free to get in which was not true.  As soon as we paid to get in my husband was turned around two steps in the door by the bouncers to the parking lot and informed him he can't go in.  My husband went peacefully outside and asked for his money back that they took from him for a cover charge.  He was then tackled to the ground by the thug bouncers busting open his lip and giving him a sprang ankle.  He was out in the parking lot!  My husband was not hostile, and just wanted to have a good time with our friends not to be attacked by the staff for no reason!  This place doesn't care about it's customers and feels it's in their right to assault anyone they choose to pick on.  Do not support this club/restaurant... I will be telling everyone to stay far away.. My husband is a gentle man and would not cause any trouble. Also the club is loud, overpriced, crowded, dirty, and has really shitty music..

Stopped in for lunch on Saturday.  Restaurant inside was nice and clean, outside you need to overlook altogether.  Inside this place was a ghostown.  Being over 105 degrees out I was wearing shorts and flip flops.  As soon as I walked in I noticed they were going for a more upscale look to the place and my attire was looked up and down by our waitress before being seated.  Sorry, by the looks of the outside had no clue on a Saturday afternoon in a strip mall with no one else in the place I would have an issue with shorts.  Anyways pass that awkward moment, we were seated.  I had chosen the sausage hot sandwich on the lunch menu, and my husband the blanco pizza.  Nothing was suggested by our waitress, so I was hoping that was a good choice.  Food came out pretty fast because there was no one else in the place.  Food was bland, bread was to chewy like it needed to be baked more. I won't be going back.

Stopped in Sunday for lunch after a high recommendation from a friend of mine in San Diego.   She claimed it was the best sub she's ever had so I had to try it.  Unfortunately my sub came up short with lack of taste and toppings.  When we pulled up I noticed it was super busy and was thinking man they must have great subs for it to be so packed.  Was lucky to get a booth inside but it wasn't as clean as others have stated in other reviews.  I had to take one of their comment cards and wipe the table of all crumbs on the ground as others had obviously done from the looks of the floor.  I had the Chipotle Cheese Steak sub that I split with my husband.  The bread tasted ok, but it wasn't fresh out of the oven. They skimpt on the steak and hardly saw any onions at all on it.  For the price of the sandwich I really was expecting to get more.  The sauce was the best thing about it but I was wanting more of it as well.  I won't be going back.  Sad that it wasn't a better first impression.

It's delicious! But shhhhh, don't tell anyone else, lol.  Place gets packed real quick but totally worth the wait.  I tried three different things, the fish taco, carne taco, and the hotdog.  Fish was really good, tasted fresh.  Carne had great flavor and the hotdog was yummy with the avocado and bacon toppings.. mmmm..   What really stood out to me was the different sauces they included, everyone had a different flavor that really set off the food.  I don't live right by the place but would differently drive a few more miles  to eat here.

Had a great treasure hunt at this event.  Book prices and quantities are amazing.  This event is well organized with a lot of helpful staff standing by.  I pulled a few event volunteers for help and all went well out of there way to help me find what I was looking for. Came out with two giant bags of hard to find books for $80 bucks.. I bet I would have paid excess of $800 bucks for the ones I picked out.  People from all over the country come to this so watch out, you will find a line of people.  I was told people lined up as early as a day before the event to get their place in line. Also bring a box, rolling cart or your own huge bag to stuff your books in, shopping carts inside the event went fast. Wonderful charity and I look forward to attending next years event.

I planned on seeing a movie the first time I went so I had a super good first experience at Filmbar.  We arrived about 30 min early to sit and have a cocktail or two before the movie started.  Place was pretty empty until around 10 minutes before the show started.  I like the local selection of drafts beers available at a reasonable price.  I also noticed a selection of different wines from behind the bar.  Place felt very artsy and chic perfect  for a date night.   We moved from the bar area to the theater and right away felt so comfortable.. Had my beer in one hand and sat down in some very comfortable leather seats.  Which makes me wonder why these fancy dancy big theaters don't have more comfortable seating as well? I see they do show Rocky Horror Picture Show once a month, they have live music and Dj's, and even comedy.  Seems like a hip place to check out a variety of entertainment.  Happy I found out about this place and will be going back.

Went to this Venue for the first time to see Dave Attell.  Ticket prices were awesome, but it's because the drinks are super expensive.  Lets start off with the Venue, it was way to packed and I'm a little thing.. 4' 11" and was sat in the very last seat at the end of the table and couldn't see a thing on stage. The layout was just so awkward.  Everyone is sat so close together in rows were you can't move an inch without bumping into the person you don't know right next to you. Everyone kept moving their heads and each time the person in front of me moved I had to move, it was exhausting fidgeting around all night on rock hard chairs.  Also you might think sitting on the end had an advantage of a little more room, but think again.  All night I was being bumped and pushed into from servers and people trying to get by a narrow hallway like little ants.   Our server was really nice the few minutes we had with him the whole night. Drink prices are way crazy.. It was suggested I order the doubles, they ended up tasting like singles.  I think for like 5 drinks (including ordering the special bogo shot special they had)  our drink total was like $74 bucks for two people.  They do charge an automatic tipping of 15% on your bill.  So with those prices and ticket prices to see the act we ended up paying a pretty little price.  I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible, I was so uncomfortable all night sitting there.  I'll probably skip this venue in the future, because I couldn't enjoy myself being so uncomfortable.

Not sure if I should even write a review, but I did try to attend and was so annoyed even trying to park I left.  Thought I should at least let others know of my experience.  I purchased 2 for 1 tickets online from Voice Daily Deals (New Times) online.  I wasn't thinking it was going to be crowded so we ended up going around lunchtime to drop in and be able to sample different trucks food.  Lines started a couple of blocks in our car away from the event just to get into the parking lot.   After making it near the fields where the event was after 20 minutes still in line.  I saw the huge amounts of lines of hundreds of people waiting in the lines through the chain link fence.  After sitting still in the parking lot line waiting to park for another 10 minutes got to thinking that we probably wouldn't be able to eat for another hour or so if we are lucky at that.  My husband and I voted against waiting in line that long to eat so we made a u turn from the line and ended up handing our printed ticket to a couple that was walking towards the event.  Ended up eating elsewhere and was served right away.  I won't be going back for this event after reading the reviews posted here, glad I made the executive decision of taking off before getting in the door.

I've been to a lot of Museums. For the price of admission, $18 bucks a ticket (I'm not a local) I was disappointed. Staff was super nice with directing everyone where to explore next.  I like the location, it's off the strip and in a the historic courthouse, but that's where it stops for me.  They charged for parking, which didn't seem right to me, the Museum should have had parking for the guests.  Most of the displays are pictures mounted on walls.  They had a little "show" in one of the courtrooms with lights going off but it didn't hold my attention and was waiting for it to be over with. They did have some mob evidence of different items, but I was expecting a lot more.   I felt underwhelmed going through the exhibit because I knew I could find most of these pictures online.  Gave it two stars because I didn't learn anything new.

I had a wonderful time last Saturday here at The Great American BBQ & Beer Festival.  Arrived around 2pm and didn't have any problems finding a parking space.  The city really had it planned out as far as traffic and parking.  Major plus is that they didn't charge to park in the parking structures that were right next to the event.  Walking in was a breeze and the staff were super friendly.  Right away I could tell I wasn't the only fan of BBQ.  Tons of people lined up for all the awesomeness.  Lots of BBQ venders lined throughout the event, so no matter where you were you could smell or stop in for some good eats.  Beer was flowing and I liked that the the selection was a local Chandler brewery of SanTan Brewing Co.   Along with endless selection of venders selling food, they gave a bonus of some awesome punk bands that I remember seeing in the 90's.  Loved the nostalgia of seeing all these great performers on stage.  My only complaint was the level of sound for the music.  It needed to be a lot louder then it was.  I was near the stage and still needed it louder for an outdoor event.  I also enjoyed that they let in's and out's of the festival, it made it easy to slip on by local businesses to stop in and sit down to get out of the sun for awhile.  All and all I had a super great time, and would definitely come back next year!

Location I loved, not to far away from where I live.  It's located right in the Holiday Inn parking lot and is pretty big inside.  As soon as I walked inside for this Friday night dinner I noticed the place was pretty empty.  I like the vibe of the place. It feels really clean and modern with more of an upscale feel from other restaurants in the neighborhood.  The waitress was super nice and really gave top notch service throughout the night.  They have a full bar with some really good deals during happy hour so I took advantage by trying one of the mixed drinks they had listed.  Forgot which one sorry, but it was yummy, no skimping on the alcohol either.  I had the Lamb special for the evening and my husband ordered the Chicken Marsala. We shared plates and the food was just ok to me.  I like things spicy and felt it didn't meet what I liked.  As we were leaving we got a huge surprise, a Belly Dancer came out to entertain everyone.  Loved the show, location, and service.

Stopped in last Saturday for lunch. I had seen the signs up for weeks about the place opening and was happy to see it finally was open.  The restaurant was nice and clean, and had plenty of staff checking in on us. We ordered the BBQ spring rolls for an appetizer, those were really good.  They come with a side of this yummy peanut sauce that was pretty darn good.  With our appetizer we got 4 full size rolls that were plenty for the two of us to start.  I must say  that the happy hour was already started around 3pm, forgot what hours they were good from but I believe you get a discount on the apps, and beers were cheap, like $2.50 for even the premium ones.  I ordered the second pho dish on the list, they have two sizes, medium and large.  I ordered the medium and it was really good.  The bowl was huge, I had so much for leftovers I had it for dinner later that night.  My husband ordered a stir fry dish and he said that was good too.   What really stood out was the great service we got.  All the employees were really nice and answered all our questions.  I believe either the owner or manager came out and welcomed us and thanked us for coming in to try the food.  I felt very welcomed and it was nice to get the extra attention.  On cold days like today pho is perfect, so go try it.
