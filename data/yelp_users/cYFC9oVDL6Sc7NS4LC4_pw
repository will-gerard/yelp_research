I went to this location for the first time and needless to say I will never be back! The food was disgusting and cold, and the service was unbelievably horrific! I waited 10 minutes for a refill and when the waitress came to our table, she took off my straw and lid herself, touching MY straw, put the dirty plates down on our table, and put my cup in her apron pouch where food was all crusted on. I couldn't believe what I saw. I was completely disgusted. That is no where near sanitary! I know it's just "golden corral" but please get your service staff in check!

First I'm going to complain. When I moved in, the office ladies were very helpful! The manager Dina was great until she got replaced with the new manager that is here now. She doesn't even come out of her office! Youlanda S. is the only representative in the front office that actually cares about her employees. The others are rude and apparently do not care for the people living here. I try calling the office whenever I need maintence and NO ONE answers the phone. I've tried calling at least 15 different times, and no one picks up. I've put in work orders that were supposed to be submitted. I was even told a time frame that they would have someone come to my apt and no one showed up. The stuff in the apartment is cheap! I've had the laundry door and pantry door fall on me over 3 times now. I've also has stuff stolen from my patio...I even caught a male (stranger) standing on my patio looking around when I was home by myself. I called Gilbert PD and when I spoke with the new manager she advised me to "take a picture" of the thief...are you joking? The good things about this place is the rent is cheap for the area that it's in. I've been here 3 years now and my rent has never been raised. Also, the maintence staff are great! They leave this complex looking spectacular and are always willing to help when needed!

Hands down one of the best italian food places I've ever been to! They need to open more locations in the Easy Valley! I drive 45 minutes to eat there and come home. It's SO worth it!

I went in this afternoon around 5:30 to get an oil change and car wash. I was inside waiting for my car to finish and I witnessed the most shockingly horrible customer service in my entire life. This lady (who was pregnant might I add) took her car in to get a detail to clean the inside and wax her Yukon. The service guys said her car would be done at 2 pm today and by 5:30 it still wasn't finished. She asked the receptionist who was on her phone the whole time complaining how she can't wait to be off work, she asked her to see when her car will be finished because it doesn't take 9 hours to vaccum and wax a car. The service tech stormed inside and said "If you want me to finish your car by 6, STOP CALLING ME" and slammed the door. I couldn't believe someone would talk to a customer like that. Then, when the lady asked to speak to a manager, the manager came in without allowing the customer to speak and was bashing her on how her car was dirty and it's taking a long time to finish. He didn't even let her speak and wouldn't even give her his name. She proceeded to ask for the manager above him and he said he was the only manager. So she asked for the corporate information and he just turned around and walking back outside and shut the door. Luckily the lady at the front desk had the corporate information to give her but jesus christ! I've been in customer service for over 10 years and have NEVER experience such horrible customer service before in my entire life. You would think that after their ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT "trouble" that the car was franchise just experienced recently, that they'd step up their customer service skills! I will NEVER come back to this car was again!

I went in for my boyfriends bday dinner last night and had the worst experience! We were quoted 30 minutes for a table which turned into an hour of waiting. When we were seated, our waitress didn't even say hello, or asked if we wanted any drinks/appetizers. She just dropped off water and left to go make coffee for 15 minutes. We got our drinks 20 minutes after sitting down. When we ordered appetizers, which included a $35 cheese board that wasn't very good, it took another half hour for that. We ordered our food which we didn't get for almost 2 hours after sitting down. Since we waited an hour to be seated in the first place, we were already starving. Since we waited so long the waitress brought out flatbread to tide us over until we received our dinner entrees. Then, come to find out the flat bread wasn't complimentary like she said it was. We asked to speak to the manager which at this point, my boyfriend walked out because he was so outraged by their customer service. The manager (short blond hair) came over to our table and immediately got defensive and told us (the customers) that we were wrong. She also told us "we don't do bread service here, so I paid for your flat bread out of my own pocket". The manager then proceeded to call a member of my group, conniving which instantly pissed us off even more than we already were. I explained that customers are always right no matter what and that once we leave she can talk as much crap as they want. I couldn't believe how rude and hostile the manager was towards us. I have never experienced such horrible customer service in my entire life! Also, the food was only mediocre....I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if my life depended on it.

A friend and I went there for the first time two days ago! We looked at the reviews on yelp and decided we wanted to try it out. We've been getting manicures and pedicures for years now (too many to count!) so we know what a good pedicure consists of. The shop overall was very clean and we were greeted when we walked into the door. This salon is extremely busy! There was always someone waiting to be helped the whole hour we were in there. I purchased the "Signature" pedicure which is a step up from their basic one. Now I do have a few complains that will prevent me from going into that salon ever again! My heels of my feet on both my friend and I were still rough with dead skin hanging off...this is not okay with me! I've never had that happen before! Also, I picked out a design and when she started doing it, it didnt look like the pictures at all, the nail lady didnt even get nail polish across my whole nail! So, I had her switch colors to just a plain purple. I wasn't going to have her keep trying to create something that obviously she didn't know how to do. When my friend was finished with her toes, the lady didn't even put a top coat on!! I was appauled. I will never be going back there EVER again. It's definitely not worth the money, it's so busy that they try and rush you out of there. I wouldn't even pay $15 for what it was.

Their selection of ejuice is amazing! I'm addicted to Halley's Comet...it's a menthol wintergreen flavor! The employees are so nice as well! I'll definitely be going back.
