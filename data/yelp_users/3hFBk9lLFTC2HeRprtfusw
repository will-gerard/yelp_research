The service was slow and the food was mediocre....I won't go back. For what you pay for a dinner out these days it should be worth it!

This place is awesome. It's old school diner breakfast with great food and great service. The best cup of coffee in town coupled with delicious food. The chicken fried steak is a must as well as everything else!
