I have been going to Desert Jade since I was 7 years old. There is no other Chinese place in the Metro Area that can compare to Desert Jade!! All their food is made fresh to order, and though the decor is a little dated, the service is impeccable!  My absolute favorite dish is the Kung Pao Chicken! I also love the sizzling rice soup, outstanding!! You cant beat the prices on their lunch specials.  Try Desert Jade, you will become a regular too!

Nothing beats Desert Jade.  They've updated their dining room and accommodate my now vegan diet.

Its been over 3 years since my hubby and I visited a BK.  (New commercial - veggie burgers, etc) We went to the drive thru and ordered burgers, which literally took 5 minutes.  After taking payment, we were advise to drive up to the front door and park.  We waited another 10 minutes for our "fast food" dinner.  Then, part of our order was missing, another few minutes.  We get home, the burgers are BURNT - NOT EDIBLE.  Any trained cook would know to START THE F*CK OVER on those burgers. They were not fit for our dogs to consume.  DISGUSTING!  I called the manager, who spoke very little English and was completely unhelpful.  I am SUPER PISSED we wasted our money and time on crap food.  I went to myBKexperience.com, but apparently they only want to hear some feedback, because they "had received the required amount of feedback for the time period." WHAT? *ALSO, I should add the "manager" said she would provide us with a refund, but we had to drive the 20 minutes back to her store - RIGHT NOW with the credit card.  Yeah, Easter weekend, Ill just drop everything.  UGGG!.

If you want your order to be correct, call another franchise. They do not listen, forget to include the additional items in the delivery, but NEVER forget to charge you for them! We ordered 2 Pizzones, only one came, then the "manager" (I'll use the term loosely) gave us attitude when we called back to complain. She had the Pizzone redelivered, AN HOUR LATER, without so much as an apology!! I hate hate hate this Pizza Hut!

I used to love this place, and have been dining there since the location at the Biltmore Fashion Park was opened. I took my Granny here the other day, although I hadn't been there in over a year. It was just after 12:30pm, and we were one of 3 tables. The music was horrid, loud techno, and our waiter Tomas had no knowledge of the menu. I asked for the spicy tofu, even though he couldn't tell me what made it spicy or if there were animal products in it. It came without any sauce at all! Very bland, although everything was cooked well. My Granny wanted orange shrimp from the lunch menu. When we received the bill, we were shocked to see that they had charged us $17 for 7 pieces of shrimp!! Apparently the shrimp wasn't on the lunch menu, so he charged double, without telling us first. I understand why they are going under, a $40 charge for two lunch entrees is ridiculous. We wont be back.

Renewed our vows with Elvis! Great experience, pretty professional. Got us a space quickly, as this was decided on a whim. They seem to have a lot of options to choose from, and the venue is actually pretty nice. (Great for pics FO SHO!)  Loved it.  The only con is that the photographer made us feel very uncomfortable afterwards telling us about all her medical issues, basically trying to get more cash out of us. We really just wanted to enjoy the moment together, and she took that from us.  Otherwise, we'd give it 5 stars.

Ive been here a few times in the past for some family events, but would have never chosen it for my own outing.  I went tonight with a couple girl friends and really enjoyed the new menu.  I had the corn pasta dish which was AMAZING! The portion was just right, not too much, not too little.  The other girls had the flat bread and a chicken salad, and said both dishes were really yummy.  The decor is nice and the service was good. I will definitely be returning.

So, although I live in Scottsdale, just Harley's yummy cheesy garlic bread is totally worth the drive, not to mention all the other authentic, freshly made Italian dishes!! I am ADDICTED, I admit it. Their bread is so fresh and delicious, I've never had another Italian bread like it. Its especially enjoyable with the house Chardonnay, which is very reasonably priced. Then, when I feel like completely forgetting the concept of calorie control, I order the Fettuccini Alfredo. This dish is made the way it was supposed to be, heavy cream and butter; CAN YOU SAY YUM? AND I can add whatever I feel like to it. For example, chicken and garlic.  Harley's has an intimate ambiance and is a perfect place for a romantic dinner for two, or even a  large family gathering. I highly recommend Harley's Bistro.

Alex, the manager, was SO rude to us last night. His attitude was so hateful, our whole group of 15 got up and walked out, before evening being seated. Not quite how we imagined our friends 21st birthday. What's really awful is that our group of 15 to 20 people gather there three times a month for dinner, which was mentioned. Obviously this guy doesn't care for our business. We won't be back, as this guy seems to enjoy picking fights and arguing with customers. WORST MANAGEMENT EVER!

Its seems like a decent place, and certainly has potential, but we wont be back until its more sanitary.  My problem being VEGAN is that the meat station is at the beginning of the line.  This wouldn't be a problem if PEOPLE DIDN'T USE THE VEGETABLE TONGS TO SQUISH DOWN THEIR RAW MEAT into the tiny bowls provided.  I asked the line staff how they prevent cross contamination to which she replied "I dont understand what that means."  Ok, fair enough, she isnt educated.  So I asked for a separate clean tong to use, even though I know that "meat juices" are already mixed in with the veggies.  She said they only have one for each container, and no extra clean ones.  At this point I was just too grossed out to eat.  My husband, being a carnivore didnt mind, but has been in the bathroom "declaring war on Mongolia" all evening, so I guess my theory could have been correct.   We brought all this up to our waitress, as I would have like to have had dinner there, and she says its the corporate office's decision to have it that way, and had been asked this same question several times before. She mentioned that Muslims should absolutely NOT eat there, as there was NO way of knowing for sure if the food was cross contaminated with pork, and that the sign asking about "allergies, and special dietary requests" was a joke.  Until they switch up the order of the stations, Veggies Beware!

We were really excited to order from the new pizza place in our neighborhood, however, when we called tonight, the girl who answered the phone acted downright irritated that we called.  I mean, really really irritated.  Not even halfway through the call I was already tired of the attitude, so I decided to hang up.  This household doesnt support business that act like they dont want our business. MANAGER  That girl needs a serious talking to in regards to customer service.

My friend from work and I ate here on our lunch hour and I was impressed not only with the delicious food, but the impeccable service. One of the managers actually remembered my friend -by name- although she hadn't eaten there in several months! When my fiancee and I decided to throw a Luau style engagement party, I decided to call them about catering. I went in and spoke with Eric, who was super helpful and even let me try a couple of the sides. He really took the extra time to listen to our needs and understand our budget. Eric was sooo accommodating!! He delivered our dinner for 45 people personally and even offered to grab any last minute (non Rumbi) items that we may have needed on the way! Our party was a huge hit!! Everyone complimented the food. ERIC-THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH, YOU MADE OUR PARTY A HUGE SUCCESS!

Our car club usually dines here at least one Thursday every month.  We love it! There is cooked food options for the younger kids, great sushi options for us older kids, and a pretty good happy hour menu.   (I also love that they have vegan options for the two veggies in the group.)  The service is kinda crappy, but we are a pretty laid back crowd.

This was my first time visiting Tandoori Times.  After seeing it advertised on Groupon, I thought I'd give it a try.  My friend and I decided to go for lunch to celebrate her birthday.  It was very busy, which was promising.  The waitress was on her second day working there and was unfamiliar with the menu, but she was friendly.    The house salad was mediocre, the entree (Algoo Gobi) was delicious, but the desserts were AWFUL.  The "mango" ice cream was a neon orange and tasted nothing like mango, or any flavor of ice cream Id ever tasted actually (kinda vanilla, kinda puke).  YUCK.  The rice pudding was not worth eating either.    The worst part of the experience was being followed out into the parking lot, after leaving the Groupon and cash tip, to be told that we needed to come speak with management about not ordering at least $40 worth of food!  Really?  I told the waiter that we had spent just over $30, and we obviously didn't expect any cash back from the $40 Groupon.  He said his manager was "fussy" and wouldn't like it.  I basically told him that was too damn bad, and that I wasn't ordering $10 more in food; I was actually kinda saving them $10!   He finally figured out what I was saying and left us alone.  I did end up calling the manager though, who was not pleased to hear about our experience with the dumb waiter.   I don't foresee returning there.

The pedicure price changed several times by the time I ended up getting to the register. First 20, then 25, then 28.  I ended up paying the $25.  ALL I had done was the basic #1, basically a polish change and a "massage". No flowers, french paint, just basic.  I HATED the massage, which was an ARM massage for some reason. Some random dude ( who did not paint my nails) came over and started rubbing my arms with a tiny bit of lotion, HARD.  So hard in fact, I ended up with some lovely finger shaped bruises.  I kept telling him "ow, ouch, that hurts, gently, lighter, PLEASE! No more."   The nail polish job was so poor, that I had sticky polish stuck to my sheets the next morning.  You can imagine how my toes looked.   Not going back, not impressed.

This place is just NOT what it used to be.  Ive tried it twice more, on the hope the bad food and service was a fluke.  Im sad to say they have not redeemed themselves and I wont be back for the ice cold chili (which is dangerous to serve btw), the overpriced little salads, and the rancid nut burgers.  Something happened to this place, it was so good when they opened. I met one of the owners; talented and friendly.  Now even the menu looks like it came from a bad Chinese food restaurant.  :o(

I HATE dealing with kids in movie theaters.  I never go to see a Disney or pixar flick, so I obviously don't want to be annoyed by the non stop chatting and BS that goes along with having kids. (Let me just add that parenting isn't what it used to be.  My mother would have smacked the crap outta me for acting a tenth of the why children today act. Its disgusting.) With Ultrastar I don't have to worry about it.  Just pick movie showing in a Star Class theater and we are assured a nice evening.  I can order a glass of wine or a veggie sandwich and just relax in their comfy chairs.  Love it!!

Love it! Best veggie sub EVAR! The staff is super friendly, always singing along to the music playing, and enjoying themselves.  They always make my sandwich the way I ask. Everything tastes fresh and delish! My one complaint - delivery.  We live LITERALLY 1 1/2 miles south, basically in a straight line, from the store.  They will not delivery to Scottsdale. Totally lame.

This is the place to go before seeing a show at Stand Up Live. It was Thursday night and this place was PACKED. We had to sit at the kitchen bar, which were probably the best seats in the house.  The salad chef was social, explaining the difference in meats and cheeses on the menu, while still running his station effortlessly. We even got a little taste taste of one of the items. We ended up ordering all sorts of things we probably would have never tried if not for him (salad chef).  Our actual waiter was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu.  So much in fact, I let him surprise me with my entree.  He chose a lovely sea bass, cooked perfectly. Absolute heaven. We we on a flavor high, so naturally we had to try dessert.  Salted caramel pudding with sliced apples, OMG. Somebody roll me out the door.... Just go there...with people who like to share.....

Went for happy hour with a friend tonight.  Food was good, risotto she had was amazing.  Good service, but soggy buschetta.  Pretty good wine for a decent price.  Customer service was a priority to all who were working.  I like it.  Cool atmosphere. Bed time.

SUPER LONG DELIVERY TIME BUT everything was really yummy.  The salads were small, but fresh.  The pizza was the huge, floppy slice kind, but super delicious.  We recommend picking up the pizza instead of delivery, cause an hour and a half is a LONG time to wait for this deliciousness. The guy on the phone, taking our order, was super nice and helpful too.  We look forward to dining in next time.  LOOK OUT STREETS OF NY- maybe time to relocate to a different neighborhood!

I really like this place! Its small, but stylish.  Service has been very good so far, and  myself and my guests have enjoyed the food very much.  I ADORE the tuna steak sandwich, which is cooked to perfection (along with the fresh asparagus.) both times I have ordered it.  I HOPE THAT QUALITY CONTROL IN THE KITCHEN CONTINUES.  OH, and the key lime pie - AMAZING! Seriously, worth having for lunch, by itself.   My only small suggestion is dropping the prices of the normal beverages.  Paying $4 for an ice tea is a bit ridiculous.

Surprisingly good.    My hubby and another couple went here for dinner and drinks the other night.  I wasnt sure about this place because the name isnt very descriptive; but its really close to our home.   The decor is a bit sterile, but has potential.  The food and drinks were pretty good.  I was most surprised to see all the healthy food options on the menu. The happy hour was decent as well as the food prices.  Everyone enjoyed their meal. Hubby had the bison burger & sweet potato fries, friends had shrimp and flat-bread, and I had the portobello burger with quinoa kale salad.  All were tasty with the exception of the un-marinated raw kale.  Most chefs know raw kale isnt palatable until its softened, but the quinoa salad portion was yummy.   There are also TV's all over for the sports fans too.   We will be back.  :o)

I really like this place.  They have new, interesting concept dishes and everything Ive tried has been really, really good.  The bartenders (who I think may be owners too) were super personable, and when they asked my friend and I to come back for dessert after the event we were going to, we did.   I hope this place does insanely well and stays open a long time.

AMAZING!! Start to finish, the BEST lunch we've had in awhile.  We shared the Chicken and Waffles and the Buffalo Shrimp, and finished with the Oh Canada.  Chicken was breaded and fried to perfection. And although a bit tough, the red velvet waffle complemented the rest of the dish well.   The shrimp were incredible; the perfect heat and light, crisp breading. The pickled carrots were the best Ive ever had.  The dessert was the perfect ending to a truly amazing meal.   Service was average; the two waitresses seemed upset with someone and were overly chatty with each other, which left our glasses empty and cleaned plates sitting longer than acceptable.  Even with this, I cannot give our experience less than 5 stars.  The restaurant space and location was nice and clean.  The big open windows gave us a lovely view of Old Town.
