We went for happy hour yesterday after reading some reviews.  With only 15 seats for happy hour, we thought we'd have to get there early, but NO ONE WAS THERE.  The bar tender said it RARELY fills up!  Shocker!  With good drink deals ($5 martinis, $6 wines, and good beer deals) as well as $4 fondue for cheese or chocolate, this really is a great first date place.  yes, the date would have to be early, but you could easily catch a movie afterward

Decent coffee, GREAT location.  Large patio on the lake, lots of wandering ducks, grassy areas to sit on.  DOWNSIDE: SMOKERS!  EVERYWHERE!  This seems to be a place for the hipster crowd to hang and smoke.  So unless you like cancer fumes, you have to sit inside in the evenings.  Friendly staff.

Fun atmosphere, great beer (woo woo Kiltlifter!) and killer pub food.  Best in AZ hands down.  The fish and chips are to die for.  And where else can you get a beer milkshake?

Tasty dinner!  Best bet is to go with the crispy tofu, even if you are normally a meat-eater, and fake "chicken" will distract from how great the rest of the food is!  Loses a star for service.  We'll be back.

Was recommended this salon through a friend.  Tawni, the owner, is a creative genius!  All I had to do was describe my vision to her, she made some creative adjustments and recommendations, and and BAM!  I looked amazing!  She is definitly not afraid of color, and will make you look great, no matter what!

By the time I got seated (not at a table, but at the bar, in a group of 4, so we couldn't even talk to each other) after 5 hours, we were so WASTED from drinking in the "pen" next door that any pizza would have been good.  I think they mask the average-ness of their pizza by making sure you are drunk by the time you get to eat it.  OVERRATED.

Try to get a seat outside so you can watch the fountains!  THis is my favorite place to eat at the Bellagio, because the price is right, the view is right, and the food is good.  Really big servings too!

HUGE.  CROWDED.  drunk girls peeing behind clear glass doors (they forget to flip the privacy switch).  This place is impressive, but try tryst, or guess XS, for something better.  I will say we got in for free by claiming to know somebody, didn't have to wait in line.  Bouncers here like to yell at people though.

I'm not a clubber.  I got dragged by my friend and her husband.  After navigating the confusing line, we were ushered right in because we were on the list (2 girls, 2 guys) and then I saw the waterfall!  outdoor element made up for being in a club.  You could BREATHE! (unlike Tao).  Nicest bouncers in town.  even though it was busy, they have us a table to sit at until the purchasing party arrived (which wasn't until 1:30am!) and we got waitress service!  Outside the music was at a level where you could still talk.  Inside it looked like typical clubbing revelry, so if thats your scene, have fun!  Great place to go with non-clubbing friends so you can all have a good time.

Ate here two mornings in a row.  The waitresses were really nice, the food was served quick, was hot and tasty.  Value was great.  Not a long wait to be seated either, unlike many buffets that cost twice as much.  Definitly recommend

Great location!  Been here for dinner twice, brunch once.  Dinner is very good.  The espresso poured over ice cream dessert is very unique, and a must try.  For brunch, the vanilla yogurt is AMAZING!  And I hate yogurt.  It is the only yogurt I will eat.  The potato flat bread is only meh.  Long wait times.  Crazy Scottsdale clubbers fill the bar area on weekend nights too; its distracting when trying to have a nice dinner.

The white pizza with breaded eggplant added is amazing.  Lunch deals are wonderful too.  Always a fun place to go.

Great training!  Mark and Lynn really push you to be your best.  The personalized fitness programs are way better than any chain gym.  And they offer kettlebell training, which is hard to find in the valley!

Happened to stumble upon this place because we wanted to eat and not be rushed before seeing Peepshow.  The decor was really cute (old photos of 30's-40's pinup girls) and the waiter offered to let us taste most of the wines offered by the bottle, just so we could choose easier.  For dinner we ordered filets and potatoes romanoff, the mushrooms, and a daily special of baked bacon creamed spinach.  Now, we had pretty high standards, as we have eaten at steakhouses in the wynn, endore, casars, etc.  and let me tell you this place blew them all away!  Every bite was heaven!  we were way too full for dessert, but it was worth it!  We now have a new favorite steak house in town!

Trivia on wednesdays is fun.  Ever changing menu gets old, because they never have your favorites.  Service is hit or miss.  They always place good music, and pour a good pint.

Fun place!  I just wish the wait on the weekends was shorter.  Yummy roasted veggie salad with pistachios and golden beets, yummy ahi sliders, chicken dishes and vegetarian options.  The wine list rocks too!  Great organic wines for CHEAP.  And the elixers they make in house are pretty tasty too!

Stayed here sun/mon nights.  Was surprised at how busy it was!  Our luggage was on a later flight than we were, and Aria made sure it was properly delivered from the airport for us, and then brought up to our room.  The concierge set us up with GREAT seats at 2 different shows, dinner reservations, etc.  The spa services we got were relaxing, and we really enjoyed the whole spa atmosphere.  the decor and zero-scaping of the hotel feels like you are actually in the desert, like, real las vegas, not egypt or italy or somewhere.  The hotel bars made great drinks and all servers were friendly  The room.  Floor to ceiling windows and large overall size were great.  The bed was AMAZING!  the bathroom was nice too.  The remote.  oh man.  Not inuitive or user friendly.  (no off button for the tv?  we had to reset the ENTIRE ROOM to turn off the tv).  No express check out, as there was a glitch.  Curtains started having a mind of their own.  And we are pretty tech savy people!  oh well.  We really felt relaxed here, and despite the crazy remote, we will definitly be back!

Very nice location!  A little higher class than the one on Ray, as this place used to be a steakhouse.  Great indoor/outdoor bar.  And the new Strippers chicken baskets are amazing!  Friendly staff, yummy beers on tap.

I've been a few times.  The table top grilling is fun, but things are kind of expensive for what you get.  I still miss 56 East.

Love this place!  Friendly staff, great coffee, and the best pancakes in town!  The Hit-the-Spot pancakes are a must try!  Fun place for evening coffee and dessert too.  Try later in the evening, and you might get free dessert as they clean out the case for the next day!

I really wanted to like this place.  Read great reviews, and headed down for breakfast.  Nice location next to Trader Joes.  Noticed the menu only had 4 options for breakfast, and as I am a picky eater, only 1 appealed to me.  Guess the menu changes every week depending on what is fresh.  I ordered pankcakes, my fiance ordered breakfast tacos, we both got cappuccinos.  Sat at a rickety table next to dirty veggies in a loud deli case, and drank our espresso drinks, noticing they were HORRIBLE.  Tasted burnt.  Then the food was ready.  OOPS.  Only the tacos were ready, and I had to wait ofr pankcakes.  after a few minutes, I got my pancakes.  My fiance said his tacos were only ok, nothing special.  The pancakes were served with thawed frozen blueberries, odd for such a "fresh" oriented place, as well as COLD syrup.  No butter or even the OPTION of asking for butter.  They tasted like cardboard, no flavor at all.  Terrible.  After choking down 1 pancake, finishing my burnt cappuccino, we bussed our own table, not a problem, except the garbage was overflowing, and no one helped us.  We balanced our trash on the pile, and left.  We will not go back.
