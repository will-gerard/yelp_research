Here are the Highlights: Long Wait Times...... Rude Staff....... Non-Existent customer service........ Cancel orders placed on the web portal....... No Smiles. Ever  The staff at this Pharmacy are extremely curt, arrogant and extremely condescending. After waiting in line for 25 minutes to drop off a prescription I was told they could not fill it at this location, because I have a different location selected as my "Home Pharmacy" in the system. As I explained that my family and I had just moved to this new part of town, the employee told me that "We can't fill this here, you need to go to the other location". When I asked to see a manager he rudely told me he was the manager and I should know that because his vest is special color. Avoid this location at all costs.

Unassuming business park location knocks it out of the park with competition style BBQ.    You may ask yourself "What does competition style BBQ really mean?", you won't find ribs that fall off the bone, dainty plating or complex flavor profiles BUT what you will find is high grade meat, cooked to perfection with a down home side dishes and menu options using fresh alternatives.  This BBQ Joint brings a wicked burrito stuffed with beans, cheese and whatever kind of meat you want (Pork, Beer or Chicken) or go with the Midwest Monster, a BBQ sandwich piled high.  For those looking for more traditional BBQ fare, order the Pulled Pork or Brisket Sandwiches or just go with a half-rack of the killer pork ribs.  Ambiance in straight forward as the space is a converted business park location, but that doesn't mean it doesn't feel good.  Lots of BBQ posters, farm pictures and contest memorabilia let you know these guys take their food seriously.  Ample seating in the back room and the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and very approachable. Great value for the amount of food you get per order, but the best is buying bulk pounds either take-out or eat picnic style at your table.  Good mixture of POAF branded sauces which add another layer to the wonderful taste of fresh BBQ and quality meats..  Keep up the great work guys and gals!

Stopped by for lunch over the weekend with some friends visiting from out of town. Pitchers of craft beer for $7 and tasty fried pickles as appetizers. My friends ordered the "Porkwich" and they could not stop raving on the quality of sandwich. I ordered the Pastrami Reuben and was impressed by the quality of the meat, the fresh ingredients and delicious roll. I would definitely go back and try more of the menu.

The location is great, clean, friendly and seating for 25 or more. I ordered Honey Habanero and Hot chicken wings, with a side of Fried Mac & Cheese bites. The staff was very friendly answered a few questions and delivered my food with a smile.   The wings smelled delicious. The aroma of the traditional Hot is one of my favorite food associated smells. The HH wings had a complex mixture that begged investigation.  The flavor mixture of Honey and Habanero was a real treat. Not too spicy but smooth to boot.  For people on the East Side of the Valley this is worth a stop. No hesitation making the recommendation here!

Working with Andrew, Lisa, Nichole and the whole "Your Phoenix Home Source" team was a great experience. My wife and I met with Andrew and Lisa in advance to go over the services they offered, what set them apart from other listing agents and what our expectations were from a sales price.  Andrew was very conscious to make sure reality and our expectations were aligned before we signed the paperwork.  Your Phoenix Home Source worked around our schedule to set-up the Photos, Inspections, Broker Tours and of course showings for potential clients. They were very considerate of the fact we have a large friendly dog and made sure to always call us prior to scheduling appointments. The entire staff was friendly, knowledgeable and very easy to work with. When we received multiple offers from potentials buyers they walked us through the details of each particular deal highlighting the Pros/Cons on a collective level. They provided access to licensed professional repair technicians and advised us on the recommended providers they had success with previously.  Our family would not hesitate to recommend this team to any of our friends, families or co-workers, they were a pleasure to work with and always felt like they were working towards our best interest, not their own or just for a commission check.
