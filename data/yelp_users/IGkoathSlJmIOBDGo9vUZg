This is the superior of the two OSFs in the Valley.  On my most recent visit, I had a Meat Lover's plate--2 Sicilian meatballs, an Italian sausage, and penne pasta, all in a fantastic meat sauce.  Probably the best plate of pasta I've had in a LONG time.  Fill that out with minestrone soup, hot sourdough with butter, and attentive service, and you have a great meal.  My wife and daughter like the mizithra cheese pastas--not my taste, but they enjoy it, and that's all that matters.    Plus, an Italian dinner for 4 for about fifty-something dollars is pretty kickass.  I'm absolutely a fan of the OSF.  After trying Italian food all over the Phoenix area for months, this location is still, as of now, my pick for the best pasta in the Valley.  The penne REALLY IS amazing here.  If you haven't been to this OSF yet, you're really missing something special.

Love the food, but I'm docking one star because they REDUCED THEIR PORTIONS.  I used to leave this place full.  Now, I'm not 100% satisfied upon exiting unless I fill up on bread.  :/

I like big bunz.  I like big bunz and I cannot lie. . .  Welcome to Schlotzsky's, the home of sandwich harassment.  The cups here say, "You can bite my sandwich, but don't pinch my bunz".  The men's room has the sign "MANLY BUNZ" while the women's says in script, "shapely bunz".  This is a very hostile environment for sandwiches overall, with a large quantity being harassed if not eaten.  Okay, jokes over, but Schlotzkly's started it.  If you're in the mood for a tasty sammich, Schlotzsky's will give one to you in spades.  They are nice and thick--more expensive than Subway, but they taste better.  Two filling sandwiches and drinks cost about $17.  My wife told me that the owner can sometimes be a bit moody here, and this has been seen and reported on by other Yelp reviewers (hence the poor review rating overall).  I didn't have this experience, but it's something to keep in mind.  I'll keep coming back for sandwiches until this guy burns my bunz.

Looks like I went to the wrong place. . .  I was hoping to go to the same Tee Pee Tap Room where the American Progressive band Cartoon first planned their compositions.  Apparently that was the OTHER Tee Pee Tap Room.  How was the food here?  Well, lets just say that we all know what The Great Cornholio does with "tee pee".  I ordered a two enchilada plate.  The refried beans tasted really fresh. . .from the can.  That was pretty much how the whole of the meal was.  It was edible, but not enjoyable.  I was hoping to have a decent meal in a place with some history, and instead I have a meal in the wrong restaurant that was on the bad side of mediocre.  There are many good Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.  The Tee Pee Tap Room (at least this place) is not one of them.

Surprisingly large selection of books here.  My wife knew about this metaphysical book store for years, but when we went to visit it, its original location had been all boarded up for some time.  We were later tipped off as to where it had relocated.  The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but you go in and you are greeted by a wall of books going down a long wall.  I was impressed.  While I don't buy these kinds of books like I used to, some of the old used Manly P. Hall books (some of them signed) on the back wall were very tempting.  This just might be the best, most varied used book store I've found in the Valley so far.  If you're looking in the Valley for spiritual/metaphysical/religious sorts of books in the Phoenix area (and there's a few of them there), don't skip this place.  Lots of books, lots of space, and friendly service.  It's cooler in there than outside, and I'm not just talking about the temperature.

Alwun House is not for the timid.  They are a community service organization pushing forward to help those in need, and their Green Art Park is a bold plan to transform their neighborhood with something beautiful.  They're also an art gallery, and the art is avant garde and sex positive.  I went here last night with my wife for their Halloween Monster Ball and was struck by their relaxed sense of inclusivity.  All are welcomed here, and nobody cares what color your skin, hair, or fingernails are.  We enjoyed a little food, a little drink, a little music, a little dance, some cool paintings and sculptures, and a little burlesque show.  There's a lot of places to have fun in the Valley on Halloween, and we decided to do it the Alwun House way, and we liked it.  We like people who make things happen, and aren't shy about it.  We'll be back.

I don't normally go to restaurants looking for an "authentic Mexican" or an "authentic Italian" flavor, although I'll note it if I find it.  What I'm looking for is good taste, and on my 2 visits to Macayo's  when I was in Phoenix, I found it.  On my first visit, I had a very tasty two tacos, beans, and rice.  On my second, I had the enchilada sampler.  This latter was not entirely my taste, although I still thought it was good quality.  I have been to quite a number of Mexican places around the San Francisco area, and this was my first experience at Mexican food in Arizona.  I was quite pleased with the food here--and I got a LOT of it.  For what it lacked in "traditional" or "authentic", it made up for in flavor and meal size.  The decor at Macayo's was a bit loud, but not unlike some of the other Mexican places I've been to.  This is a great place for good single, couple, or family dining.  Give it a try and taste for yourself.

I never expected to come here, but sometimes your kids will lead to you to all new places to write your Yelp reviews. . .  My stepdaughter was looking for a blank skateboard deck to decorate and paint, and she knew about this place because her father went to school with the owner years ago.  We looked around, got the deck, and received friendly service.  Cool shop.  Not really my thing, but if we want to get more skateboard stuff for my kid, I'll head here again.

Meh.  That really sucked comparatively.  What happened to this place?  When I came here a few years ago before my wife and I were married, I thought this place tasted great--similar to Fresh Choice in California.  When my wife and I landed in the Phoenix area last July, we came here for dinner and I was struck by more of a sense of mediocrity than before.    After coming here a week ago, we found that it has gotten worse.  We all really had a hard time finding something here we liked.  The salad was mediocre, the panini was a doughball, and the mac and cheese might as well have been syrup of ipecac as far I'm concerned.  Only the senate bean soup was good out of all of the things I tried.  The woman clearing the tables was nice, and we at least left her a tip.  This used to be my daughter's favorite restaurant.  Now, she doesn't even want to come here again.  That says a lot to me.

There's no end of fancy schmancy pasta places out there, with the accompanying fancy schmancy price.  Even when they're not so fancy, you still are left wondering why you're paying so much money for a bowl of something that's essentially noodles with a spiced tomato and onion sauce poured on top of it.  Look, I LOVE my Italian food, and I certainly like visiting the Old Spaghetti Factory as well as Babbo's on occasion, but even these places leave me thinking that their price is a bit inflated.  It left me wondering whether or not there was a "cheap pasta place" out there--a joint that would serve up a decent noodles and sauce for a price that I would expect for noodles and sauce.  Oregano's--this is IT!  If all you're looking for a simple bowl of pasta like Nonna used to make, you need to order the "Bollo Pasta" from this place.  It's bottomless, and the dinner version is $6.99.  The marinara is a little spicy (Southern Italian style), but really great.  If you're hungry, your $6.99 will get you as much as you want until you're ready to unbuckle your belt and go to sleep.  This is the best bang for your buck Italian that you will find in the Valley, hands down.  Is it the absolute best pasta taste?  No, but for a few bucks, you can get satisfying pasta 'till you want to basta.  Oh, and their pizza is pretty good too.

Since the recession hit, you don't find too many pagan-type shops any more.  When you do, they tend to be a lot like this.  This is a one-stop shop for all of your New Age, Pagan, Wiccan, and Asatru needs.  I mention the Asatru because there is a large Norse section to this store (including about 5287 different sets of runes--I'm exaggerating).  If you need books, incense, oils, candles, non gem-quality sapphires, small Egyptian statues, etc. etc. etc., this place will likely have it for sale, and they'll throw a smile in for free.

My wife (who is from Phoenix and spent countless meals at this restaurant) characterized this place to me as the "Gay Denny's"--a label I was apprehensive about mentioning in my review until I read the the reviews of other Yelpers.  After seeing about a dozen or more references to "Jenny's", I realized that my wife's characterization is not only accurate, but quite routine and popular.  Please note that even Yelp categorizes this place under "Diners, Gay Bars".  That speaks volumes of coolness.  There is little to distinguish this from any other Denny's, and during the day it is the mild-mannered place we are all familiar with.  But at night, and particularly in the wee hours of the morning, the alt crowd arrives.  Many people from Goth and LGBTQ clubs pile in here for food at that time after dancing and socializing.  My wife and I went here after our visit to Sanctum--she walked in with her Gothy attire and no-one batted an eye.  The place had quite a crowd at 2am and they were mostly a fairly young, hip group.  Food was. . .Denny's.  Service was fine.  If you go here at 2am, you know you're not going for the food in particular but for the crowd and maybe some people watching if you're into that sort of thing.  If you're looking for a great place to get some post clubbing eats, Jenny's definitely hits a Grand Slam.  Recommended.

I have a stomachache, for GOOD reasons, not bad.  I was enjoying myself so much here that I overate.  Did I catch Pancho's at a good time, or are my standards just different that those of the other people who have been to this place?  Check my review of Valle Luna for my list of the five types of Mexican Restaurant.  This one classifies as a Type D: Chain-type sit-down restaurant.  Poncho's is more unusual because it's a buffet.  They were almost empty when we visited on Sunday night.  Service was very friendly, and the food tasted great.  No, it wasn't gourmet by any standard, but I went there expecting a Mexican buffet and was quite pleased.  I never saw a cheese enchilada with cheese both outside and inside before--it was almost a mac 'n' cheese-style enchilada.  Rice and beans were actually better than a lot of places I've visited.  Pretty authentic style.  Chips and salsa were so good I ate WAY to many of them, and the sopapillas were primo.  The price was rock-bottom, and just incredible for all you can eat food.  Great for kids (and the price is lower for them too).  Sorry, but I can't connect with the plethora of one and two-star reviews that dominate Pancho's board here on Yelp.  Yes, I think that if this place were crowded and packed to the gills with kids, it would have been a less pleasurable experience, but as it was, I enjoyed every bite.  Thanks Pancho's--I raise my cup and the flag to you.  Some appear to despise you, but I do not count in that number.  We'll be back.

I haven't reviewed this place yet?  My mistake.  Looks like I wrote a tip back around September of 2011, only to ignore this place until now.  This ain't gourmet dining, but everything from the hot dogs to the french toast is comfort food, 24/7.  Every time I go here, it's just plain fun.  After a night of dancing at one of the clubs downtown, there's usually two choices for wee morning hour eats--Jenny's and here.  This place is more original and cool, and there are more food choices available.  You know, you've been boppin' your body to beats for hours, you're like a zombie, but you're still hungry.  This is the perfect place.  They'll have a seat for you ready.

A nice, clean bowling alley.  Most alleys have pretty much the same features as all the rest--lighted lanes at night, birthday parties, pizza and burgers, etc.  At Squaw Peak though, you get it all without the dinge and wear that I usually see at a lot of other bowling alleys.  The bathroom ain't scuzzy, and you don't smell residual 30 year-old cigarette smoke.  I went here with my family last night and had a great time.  After a warm-up, I bowled a 161--the best game I ever played.  I think you'll have fun too.

If you're looking for vegan food, this is probably the best in town.  They used to be called the Vegetarian House, but they recently changed the name.  For those of you who really enjoyed the Vegetarian House of old, don't worry.  This is still the same place run by Supreme Master Ching Hai--it's just that the chain has changed names.  The food has changed very little.  The dishes here still have the same high quality and wonderful taste that they always had.  Their lemongrass vegan "chicken" and fried rice are just incredible.  And yes, expect to be bombarded as usual by the normal Ching Hai tracts on her publications and on video.  For more about Ching Hai and her "Quan Yin" method, see here:  http://www.godsdirectcontact.org/ .  For other viewpoints on Supreme Master Ching Hai, see here:  http://www.rickross.com/groups/suma_ching.html .  Regardless of your viewpoints on the Supreme Master, the food here can't be beaten for freshness or for taste.  Highly recommended.

Pleasant.  We didn't plan on coming here--we just saw it from the road and decided to visit.  I have been seeing their ads in my mailbox for some time and wanted to see what it was all about.  Huge place.  Service was attentive.  Lots and lots of plants (flowers, veggies, cacti, palms, decorative, etc,) soil, chemicals, and accessories for your garden.  We didn't buy anything, but it was nice to look around.  If my wife were wearing better shoes, we would have stayed longer.  Problems?  Well, the prices seemed a bit high in comparison to the big box hardware stores, but if the quality is better, who cares?  I didn't like the fact that many of the plants were unmarked except for a price, so you didn't even know what you were looking at for quite a number of the items.  That bugged me a bit.  Maybe they don't have the time to label everything and the merchandise goes out quickly, especially during the Spring.  However, it would be nice to know what such and such plant is without asking for assistance.  Four stars for now.  I'll tell you more when I know more.

The Italian restaurant that we have been looking for.  My 600th Yelp review, at long last, goes to Roma Garden, and this place is worthy of such a lofty number.  A good Italian restaurant is surprisingly hard to find in the Valley.  I have visited many here only to be moderately satisfied, disappointed, or even angered.  At the first bite of pasta here, I knew that I had a winner--by far this is the finest Italian joint that I know of right now in the Phoenix area.    What makes it the best?  Authenticity.  I grew up with Italian food, ate it all my life, and have cooked it for friends and family.  Does this taste like mine?  No, but it has that quality, that body, that. . .taste that only real Italian has.  Their sauce is thick, slow-cooked, and with a perfect balance of spices and tomato.  Yes.  There is no better comfort food than a bowl of rigatoni generously ladled with meat sauce.  This place can serve you up a BIG serving of just that.  Add to it a bowl of tortellini soup, and NOW you've got a meal that's worth driving some miles for.    See all those other four and five star reviews?  Here's one more.  Woohoo indeed.

I really like the Macaroni Grill in San Mateo, CA.  Thinking that a Macaroni Grill is a Macaroni Grill, I went to this location with my wife soon after we moved out to the Phoenix area.  Uh, ok.  Looks like a Macaroni Grill is NOT a Macaroni Grill.  This one didn't impress me.  I liked the bread, but the pasta was pretty well the pits.  It wasn't inedible, but it really wasn't very enjoyable either.  I grew up on pasta and have had pastas from the finest homemade style, to jarred store-bought sauces and cheap noodles.  This was getting towards the bottom.  It's hard to ruin pasta.  This MG comes pretty close.  With so many other pasta places to visit around the Valley, it's unlikely we'll be back.

Rubio's is the king of fast food.  No matter what Rubio's I go to, I always get Mexifood so good that I can hardly believe that it's fast food at all.  This location is no different. . .no scratch that, it IS different--the customer service is the absolute bomb.  With our vegetarian habits, sometimes it is difficult for us to find food that we can eat in certain places.  Kimmie, who was the employee who waited on us, really helped us construct our meal, and even brought us salsa samples to try.  The food at this Rubio's location was as good at always, and the service made it that much better.  Count on more service from us at this place--thank you very much!  You made a very long and tiring day end on a good note.

This place seems to be in malls all over the place--little wonder, the food is great!  I got the teriyaki chicken with rice and extra meat.  Cooked right in front of me and piled onto a styrofoam clamshell, it was just the right thing--filling me up nice for the evening.  Sarku is one of the better mall chains.  Get a burger next time--go here now.

It's Sunday, right?  Do I have your attention?  It's Sunday, and Barry's Capezio is closed, right?  You need dance supplies for yours or your daughter's dancing class tomorrow and the dance store that you always go to is closed.   You're looking for an alternative and you found this place.  Please don't be tempted.  When we went, service seemed friendly, but the consequences for our choice came later.  Our daughter was about ready to begin classes for pointe, and we described to them our situation.  We, on their advice, walked out with demi-pointe shoes--this was the WRONG ADVICE!  No fitting (other than to try them on), no advice as to care, just hand us the shoes and ring us up.  Nothing else.  To see the pain on my daughter's face after that first class was agonizing, as were the huge blisters all over her feet.  Wait.  Please wait until Monday.

We used to have a place like this in Daly City, CA called Pizza and Pipes, but it's no longer around.  I went there when I was a kid, and it was nice to find a place like this while I was visiting my fiancee in Arizona.  Places like this are well-known for having great organ and not-so-good pizza.  However, I found the pizza here absolutely delicious, with just the right balance of sauce, cheese, and topping.  The BIG draw here is the organ, and I was really blown away by how entertaining it was.  The organist was a great performer, and it seems as if the entire room of the restaurant was part of the instrument he conducted from the rotating keyboard on the floor.  There were flags, dancing birds, purcussion, bells, and lots to look at in the two-level restaurant.  On the night we went, it was absolutely packed and everybody was having a great time (including me).  People were clapping and singing along.  This place is definitely worth repeat visits.

I'm back. . .  and this place is as good as it was when I first came here in '08.  Apart from the organ, which is the main attraction that everybody is drawn to, I like the pizza here.  For me, the sauce on a pizza is everything, and this place has great sauce.  The pizza overall is a bit pricey, drinks are not bottomless, and this is absolutely no place to go if you are in a hurry to get somewhere after you eat.  But, if you want to spend an evening with your family enjoying pizza and listening to a pipe organ with all the bells and whistles (literally), this is a good destination.

There's different kinds of Mexican places around.    Type A:  Pseudo-Mexican fast food (Taco Bell, El Pollo Loco, Del Taco, etc.)  Type B: REAL Mexican fast food (whateveri-berto's, Baja Fresh, Rubio's etc.)  Type C: Various traditional taquerias (Los Favoritos, Rivas' Mexican Food, etc.)  Type D: "Mexican Denny's" or chain-type sit down Mexican Restaurants--traditional-style or not (Chevy's, El Torito, Macayo's, etc.)   Type E: REAL formal or semi-formal Mexican restaurants (I don't know any in the Valley yet, but in the Bay Area there is the now closed La Michoacana in San Mateo, CA, etc.)  Valle Luna is a Type D, and a pretty good one as well.  Delicious traditional-style Mexican food.  The interior looks like what you usually see in a Chevy's or Macayo's.  It's visually pleasing, and service is friendly and helpful.  They have all the beers, margaritas, and tequila that you usually find at places like this (you know what I mean).  It's the kind of Mexican place you take someone for their birthday--exactly.  Do you check in to places on Yelp using your iPhone?   Come to Valle Luna!  Show them the check-in on your phone and you get $5 off of a meal costing $20 or more.  Perfect for lunch with your co-worker.  Valle Luna means good Mexifood.  If you're in the mood for a Type D, bypass the "Fresh Mex" and come here.

Ew.  Wendy's used to be my favorite fast food restaurant.  WTF happened to their hamburgers?  They taste like beef-flavored mud with condiments now.  Their fries are terrible too as of late.  What's not terrible is their service.  This is the fastest service and delivery of food that I have ever seen from a fast food joint.  Five stars for service.  Unfortunately, I cannot rate by service alone.  Yuk.

Um. . .No.    Honestly, I'm in a major snit about this place.  I expected something a LOT better than what we found here.  Things seemed pretty good to start--food looked tasty.  Didn't take long for problems to begin showing up:    First off, my wife's lo-mein was pretty darned lo.  The first time she went here several days ago, they used the normal wide noodle that you would usually find in lo-mein.  This time, they used round noodles.  Were they Chinese chow mein noodles?  No, they were vermicelli.  Yes, I'm being a bit picky there, but I'm just getting started.  My wife ordered the lo-mein with no garlic, onions, or shallots.  The problem was, they left out most of the other vegetables as well when the bowl came to the table.  There was the occasional carrot or broccoli sliver, but very few veggies at all.  I called the waiter over to the table and informed him of the situation.  My wife told him that she just wanted to get a bowl of extra veggies to add to the lo-mein.  He took away the lo-mein that she had and said that he would be back shortly.  When he returned, he came back with two bowls--one had the vegetables she asked for, and the other was a brand new bowl of lo-mein with tofu and noodles ONLY.  Uh, what the f*ck?  Why replace the noodles she had with this and then send in a separate bowl of veggies?  Why not either give my wife back her old bowl along with the veggies or just mix up a whole new batch with the veggies?    Major issues here--even what she got after all that wasn't very good tasting.  My wife had to add soy sauce for extra flavor, and the vegetables weren't fresh--they obviously tasted like they were frozen before they were put into the wok.  My food wasn't much better in terms of quality.  I had the vegetable and tofu fried rice.  There was no issue with the quantity of veggies, but they too were of the "from your grocer's freezer" variety.  The rice was chalky and undercooked, and I also had to add soy sauce--it didn't do much to improve the flavor.  Our spring rolls were also inferior, and even the fortunes in the fortune cookies were as superficial and vapid as the food we ate.  I liked the friendly table service, and the soda machine that allowed you to flavor the soft drinks any way you like was cool.  This is what made this review two stars instead of one.  But, would I recommend Pei Wei to anyone?  No wei.  If you want a REAL Asian diner, go to Tott's Asian Diner at Ray and McClintock.  Now THAT'S fresh food, and a world of difference over Pei Wei.  Even Panda Express is better than this place.

A hay oasis?  Yes, and more.  If you have guinea pigs, you know that buying Kaytee timothy hay in that little bag gets mighty expensive after a while.  You don't always know what kind of quality it is or how old it is.  Waiting at Petco for a sale so you can save a buck off the hay just doesn't do it for me any more. . .  Okay, I've got news for you--no more Petco for the damned hay.  Come to Aden's Hay Oasis.  Hay by the BALE.  Stop wasting your money.  When I was here, they were out of timothy hay bales, but bales of alfalfa and bermuda grass were like $15 or $16 per bale.  They did have large, gallon-sized ziplock bags filled with timothy hay for $2.  Two dollars!  I got three, and they're fresh and no doubt tasty to my cavies.  Guinea pig owners in the middle of the Valley may think that it's too far of a drive out to Higley just for hay, but consider what you pay every time you go to the pet store--you get a tiny bag of hay that's priced like it's gold.  Believe me, when you think about it, you realize that driving that distance to get a BALE for $15 ain't bad at all.  Plus, they're really friendly folks here.  To all my fellow cavy enthusiasts--make the drive and get your hay here.  It's full guinea pig bellies on the cheap.

Whew, garlic.  Been to a CF only twice before--once in Palo Alto, CA, and once in Hollywood.  I thought that the food was okay then, but not so much now.  I'm usually a fan of pasta at most restaurants--even at Denny's it's halfway decent.  The spaghetti sauce here had so much garlic in it that it was literally the only thing that I could taste on the pasta.  If I wanted aioli and noodles, I would have asked for it.  The meatballs were pretty good, but were PACKED with onions.  I now reek of garlic and onions and my wife won't get near me.  Thanks guys.  Her salad was fairly good, but nothing to write home about.  Nice bread.  Service was friendly.  It was entertaining sitting outside and watching the birds fly in after patrons would leave their tables--they would take bread and raid the sugar packets.  Meh.  Not really impressed.

Meh is right.  The food is good--you can get a lot of eats on your plate at the buffet, but in the smoky gambling area, I have definitely seen better.  Lots of machines, but kind of false advertising.  When they talk about a penny machine, they need to mean it.  When I looked at the penny machine, it said that the minimum bet was 80 credits.  That means that it's not a penny machine, it's an eighty cent machine.  The minimum for the two cent machine is twenty credits.  Okay, so that's a forty cent machine.  Sucks.  Last time I was in Vegas, a penny machine was a penny machine, and you had the option for 1 credit if that's what you wanted.  You could put $40 in the machine and sit there for a while--maybe you'd lose all of it, but you had fun for 45 minutes to an hour.  Or, maybe you'd walk away with $42 or $45 dollars.  Either way, you had fun for a long time.  At the machines here, your fun doesn't last, and the machines are pretty tight.  Nah.  I'll pass next time.  If you're just looking to gamble for fun, don't come here.  There are better options available.

Only three stars?  That's odd--their VIB (Very Important Breakfast) boasts a four item meal for $6.99 that's really hard to beat in my mind considering how good the french toast is here.  All of our meals here were fantastic today, with really friendly service.  This place blows Denny's out of the water in terms of overall quality.  The only drawback is that you can't repeat any breakfast items on the VIB--they all gotta be different.  Small price to pay--literally.

My 300th review on Yelp was a Taco Bell on Ocean Ave. in San Francisco.  For my 400th, I'm moving a few notches up:  Garcia's Mexican Restaurant in Tempe, AZ.  My wife and I were exhausted and hungry after an evening meeting with our realtor.  After some deliberation, my wife suggested Garcia's  This is not the Garcia's with which she was familiar, but we know the area (near a Denny's that we frequent), and I have seen the place before, so it was easy to find.  According to my guide to Mexican restaurants (see my review of Valle Luna), Garcia's classifies as a type D, or chain-type sit-down restaurant.  I had a cheese enchilada plate and she had her usual chile relleno combo.  My meal was quite tasty.  The chips were thin--not as thin as those at Chevy's--but easily crunchable and dippable, with a good salsa and bean dip.  The enchiladas were delicious, and the rice was unusually spiced with something resembling a curry/cumin mix--very good though.  The black beans were fair.  My wife liked her relleno combo, but was surprised by the amount of breading.  She enjoyed her meal on the whole as well.  Service was friendly and we both left satisfied.  We also got a meal to go for our daughter at home, and were happy to see the large amount of chips and salsa that they packed into our to go bag.  Thank you Garcia's for a good type D Mexican meal.  Here's another place my wife and I need to frequent here in Tempe.  Next time we're tempted to go to the Denny's nearby, I'll suggest going here instead.

I'm really pleased with the services that we got at this place.  My wife and I are on a specialized meal plan that requires that we weigh and measure all of the food we eat.  This kind of planning and prep makes it very difficult to eat out.  However, the folks in the deli here were very helpful and accommodating to our requests in this regard.  Then, when we were in the checkout line, our clerk offers us bags of ice to keep our food cold on the way home.  This is far and away better service than the Whole Foods in San Mateo back in the Bay Area.  I even remarked to my wife that I wish they could just pick the whole building up and relocate this Whole Foods to the San Francisco area.  We'd come often for the great service.  Prices are higher here than at Safeway, etc., but you are definitely getting what you pay for.

I found my favorite fast-food taqueria since arriving in the Valley.  It's Rivas Mexican Food.  Talk about an AWESOME-tasting enchilada plate.  They've got a menu similar to whateveri-berto's, but with a fresher, more kickin' flavor.  Kind of like if your Nana ran a drive-thru.  If you eat in, sometimes the TV is a little loud, but once you start eating, you won't care.  Go.  You will like it.  Nuff said.

Ugh.    This isn't Rivas Mexican Food--it's Torres Mexican Food now, and we seriously wish we never went.  My burro was mediocre at best--absolutely no depth of flavor.  It was like one a large version of one of those frozen, microwaveable burritos from 7-11.  My wife's and daughter's chile relleno plates were actually awful--they left the seeds inside the chiles, making them much too hot.  My daughter is Mexican in heritage and grew up on good homemade Mexican food from her Nana.  For her to complain that the food made her mouth feel like it was on fire really says something.  Even the jamaica was no good--really too sweet.  The final straw came with my bathroom visit.  It smelled like there was a natural gas leak in the men's room.  There was no soap, no paper towels, and the toilet paper roll had bloody fingerprints on it.  Yup, you read that right.  Grossed my ass out.  We are all seriously hoping we don't get sick now.  Never again.

The return of Sweet Tomatoes!  There isn't much more I can say than what has already been said in other reviews.  Yes, the Field Kitchen experiment has failed and Sweet Tomatoes has gone back to its old format.  Even better, with the renovation and cool new soda machine and utensils, it's better than ever.  Before the Field Kitchen phase, I was just ho-hum about this place.  Now, it's a place with such good-tasting food that I want to return on a frequent basis.  The only bad thing is that the soda machine has one spigot for over 100 flavors.  If you want a drink, you are going to need to get in line.  Apart from that, this place is primo now.  My family and I aren't the only ones happy to see this place back and better-- when we visited recently, it was PACKED.  Lots of veggie options only sweeten the deal here.  Pile on your plates and chow down!

Interesting.  I guess different strokes for different folks.  I brought my daughter here a few days ago for bloodwork and everything seemed fine.  Since it was summertime and I'm a teacher, getting in here in the middle of the day was a piece of cake.  We sat and waited for about ten minutes and we were called in--no problems.  The attitude here is VERY casual, but friendly.  The phlebotomist (her name was Bev) did a really good job.  I had no issues here, but I am mindful of the other reviews here.  I'll try this place again another time and see how I fare. . .

Okay, let's get it straight here:  This is:                       Denny's They serve:                Denny's food They're open:            24 hours Your expectations:   moderately low, but you still expect some quality                                      to the food and service  . . .and you'll get it here.  Yes, it's Denny's, but $6 plus drink, tax, and tip will get you a decent and filling breakfast plate at 9 in the morning, 3 in the afternoon, or 12 midnight., and that ain't bad.  Our server was friendly and helpful.  If all you're looking for is Denny's, this Denny's will do just fine, especially if you're on the road in town at 10:00 at night and all the other restaurants around have already closed.

Finally, a Mexican joint in Tempe I can rank with some of the best places in Phoenix.  We've been looking around for a while now to find a spot that is on the same level as Mi Patio or La Santisima.  This is it.  There have been a lot of disappointments and "pretty good" places, but the prize for best Mexifood in Tempe goes to Manuel's.  For between $10 and $15, you get a big, hot plate of food with a smile from your server.  Every bite of my enchilada was loaded with cheese and meat, with a taste far more complex than that of most of the Mexican places in town.  Manuel's has been around for a while, so they know how to serve you right.  Apart from the good taste of the food, our server and even the manager came around frequently to check in on taste, drink refills, or just to see if we wanted something.  Because of this, Manuel's is now our go-to place for a sit down Mexican meal in town.

Made me very sad.  For a while, I was really liking this place and looking forward to some excellent Mexican chow.  Last time I went there, I got good service, but not so good food.  The salsa tasted like tomato and onion. . .missing. . .something. . .a lot. . .  I literally could not eat the rice or the beans--they tasted awful.  The beef enchiladas were so one-dimensional in flavor that I couldn't even finish them.  My wife was similarly unimpressed.  I usually clean out a plate of Mexican food when I eat it--that's how it has been here in the past.  I just left food on the table this time.  Some time back, I got a punch card from here where you can get $5 off a meal after you order 9 entrees.  It's got three punches on it.  I didn't get a punch on my last visit because I don't foresee myself coming here again.  It's really too bad--I used to like this place.  What happened?

Freakin' yum.  Let  me give you the "skinny" on this place.  My wife and I were looking for a place to eat on St. Patrick's Day that didn't have a huge drunken crowd.  Then she suggests this place, saying that she ate there before with a co-worker.  Hoping that it wasn't "Smello's", I took her up on the suggestion.  OMG--we got the "Skinny", an ironically named pizza with about 6 different kinds of meat.  We also got it deep dish.  IT WAS SAUCY--just the way I like it.  The bacon (not the Canadian variety) was the taste that made the pie.  The three slices left over made the perfect lunch the next day.  Just the kind of pizza I've been looking for.  Knife and fork or by hand, this is my favorite pizza in the Valley so far.  Go here.

Didn't ever expect to see a store like this in a mall.  Lots of new age shops have some crystals, but this place is like none I've ever seen.  This is probably the largest store dedicated to rocks, minerals, and crystals that you will ever find.  It's not just the junk that you find in the toy stores and gift shops--they have large amethyst geodes, some still in the boxes that they came in when they were shipped from Brazil.  If any of the following apply to you, then you will find something you like here:  Fossil collector Rock collector Rock tumbler Cabochon maker Jewelry maker Unusual gift buyer Jewelry buyer Mystical practitioner  I'm not kidding.  In some places, you'll see a couple of tektites available for sale, or a few pieces of optical calcite.  Here, you can look through a BOX of tektites to find the one you want.  Calcite?  Over a dozen samples.  They've got everything except the kitchen sink. . .uh. . .no, scratch that--they DO have kitchen sinks, in PETRIFIED WOOD (about 5 of them actually).  If you want it, you'll pay the price they're asking.  It's the only place I've ever seen where you will find petrified wood sinks and chairs.  Want an African mask?  Huge copal chunks?  Tumbled stones by the bag?  A heart carved out of iron pyrite?  How about wind chimes?  Fossil sea urchins?  Peacock copper ore?  Maybe just a lingam stone?  Yes, all here and more.  And it's in a MALL.  Who knew?  If you didn't, you do now.

Pretty good.  Another gentleman (Bowie P) reported in his quite negative review of this place that he was led to a booth with a seat cushion that had a rather large (8-inch) gash in it.  My guess is that I was sitting in that very same booth, although they taped up the hole at some point since June.  It was still not the most comfortable place to sit, mind you. . .  The food was good tasting, with a distinctive flavor.  Some of the better rice and beans I've had too.  Service did not always strike me as the most sincere, and my drink refill was just banged on the table on one occasion.  Still not bad.  Kind of a '70s or '80s look to the place--some of the decor though, as attractive as it was, seemed caked in dust.  Not perfect, but a sizable and tasty meal.  Price average.

Ah yes, The Game Depot.  Whenever I walk into a gaming store it brings be back to the good old days when I was a kid playing Dungeons and Dragons.  No, not d20 or version 3.5 or all that newfangled stuff.  I mean the OLD Advanced Dungeons & Dragons with those hard cover books written by Gygax.  Yeah, Greyhawk!  White Plume Mountain!  The Vault of the Drow!  You just killed the gelatinous cube and found 5 platinum pieces!  If I continue like this, you are going to have to make a saving throw vs. nostalgia at -2 on the die. . .The days of first edition D&D are long gone, but you can find a lot of the modern D&D here in all its glory, along with many other games using boards, tiles, cards, etc.  There's also dice, metal miniatures, and a HUGE gaming area where up to a few dozen people can sit and play any kind of game they desire.  Plus, they've got enough plastic building and ground models to accommodate ANY kind of history, fantasy, or strategy play.  AWESOME gaming store.  While they don't carry the books and modules to make this aging fuddy duddy happy, at least they've got the space to sit down and get rollin'

Uh, yeah, this place. . .  While my wife was on the search for a good nail place in the Valley to replace the one she used to go to in San Francisco, I took her here a few times.  The first visit seemed okay--nothing bad, and they did a pretty good job.  On the second visit, the attitude seemed to change.  My wife picked a blue color for her toes and some of the techs seemed to be laughing at her.  Maybe we were mistaken, but their attitude seemed really strange.  The job that they did on her seemed okay, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt and just assumed that maybe that maybe they were laughing at something else.  It was the third visit that really surprised us.  We walked in early one weekend afternoon and my wife asked for a manicure and pedicure.  The owner told us that he was full up and could not take her at that time.  When we tried to schedule an appointment for later in the day, he simply told us no, and would not schedule one, not even for a future date.  No explanation, no courtesy, just no.  We got the hint.  Now, my wife goes to Colorful Nails in Tempe when she wants to get her nails done.  Always a smile, always great quality, and always happy to get our business.  I'm not sure what the deal is with this nail shop, but we will not "come for nails" there again.

The outside isn't much to look at, but there's a LOT to look at on the inside.  This is the ultimate in upholstery supply.  You could go many places to buy a chair, but here you can get the pieces and make a custom one yourself.  Want to redo your car seats?  If you have the know how, they got all the tools and materials you need to DIY.  They even have seatbelt substrate.  Did a strap on your kid's backpack rip?  Think it's time to buy a new backpack?  No.  If you have a surger, they have replacement straps.  Aisles and aisles of vinyl and cloth of different thicknesses, designs, and colors can be found here--often for prices that put Joann's to shame.  Worth a visit to come and browse.  Service is friendly, and you never know what you are going to find.

I actually didn't store anything here, but I still got probably the best service that I've gotten from a storage facility anywhere.  When I left the San Francisco Bay Area, I closed by account with the PS there, but I still had $3 left on my account outstanding.  Knowing that I could take care of it at any PS around the country, I went here to get everything finalized and finished.  The proprietor, unfortunately, struggled with the computer system, calling my old PS facility, calling the very unhelpful PS national phone service--he just couldn't get my name to come up in the records.  Nobody seemed able to help him either.  He was remarkably patient and methodical, and really worked persistently to help me finally close my account.    After about 20 minutes, he was able to get the information he needed to get my name to come up on the computer screen.  My account was closed at last, I paid my couple of bucks, and I left knowing that they man I just worked with was a hell of a hard and dedicated worker.  In the future, if I ever need the help of a storage facility in the Valley, I hope this guy is still working at this location then.  I would definitely trust him to take care of my property.

I think my wife summed it up when she remarked something to the effect of, "Why would anyone want to go in that dive and buy overpriced, mediocre pasta?"  Yeah, it was pretty mediocre.  Little more than edible, The pasta really didn't make the prospect of returning very attractive.  The marinara had so much oregano in it that it probably doubled as the pizza sauce.  The minestrone was okay, but the bread roll was a tasteless ball masquerading as sourdough.  Service was friendly enough, but that's not going to save this place.    I love me some pasta, but I don't love me Red Devil.  Pass.

Delish.  In the midst of my break (okay, lapse) from vegetarianism, I sought out this place for meaty delights.  When I want meat, I don't look for a steak--I want burgers and dogs, and Ted's did not disappoint.  With many dogs, the primary taste is from whatever condiments you put on the wiener.  With Ted's dogs, you get a smoky, slightly burnt taste of a REAL charcoal grilled frank that is enhanced by your custom toppings.  My tastes are simple and easy to please.  I like a foot long with just extra deli mustard--don't need more than that.  My wife likes more--mustard, ketchup, a little relish, and pickles.  Doesn't matter how you want it--Ted's will serve it up awesome.  Add fries and you've got a full meal for cheap.  Forget Circle K, and Wienerschnitzel can bite me.  Ted's has the dogz you're looking for.

No.  Just about the most "blah" food I have ever eaten.  The "beef teriyaki" I had was cooked cold cut beef (like the kind you get in a philly cheese steak sandwich), mixed with sauce and thawed frozen broccoli, spread on top of Uncle Ben's rice and microwaved.  Beef egg rolls?  Little taste at all.  My wife's "chicken teriyaki" was of similar quality to my entree, but to her credit, she couldn't eat it.  The price was right, the taste was wrong, and I got quite sick about an hour later.  No.  Not again.

Considering fast food?  If you have the time, and you're in the area, don't do fast food--come here.  You will have about ten times the selection of better quality food, and all you can eat, for about the same price or just a hair more that you would pay at a fast food joint.  You know that BK portions are getting smaller and you are still hungry after eating $7 worth of food.  Here, you can go back and eat until you are stuffed, whatever they got.  A stomach full of good food at a low price is always nice.  You'll get it here.

Here's a challenge for you: try being a vegetarian and go to eat at Cracker Barrel.  Vegetable plate my buttinsky--there's pork in that there dish.  Yep, my wife ordered their plate with four vegetables and two of them were loaded with pork.  Look, I'm not dogmatic about vegetarianism--if you want meat, go for it (it's tasty), but if you are offering a veggie plate at your restaurant, at least mention somewhere in the menu that it's mixed with pig meat. . .  About the best you can do at a place like Cracker Barrel (if you want to do more than graze on salad) is to resort to Starchitarianism.  In that case, either order sides or get something like their French Toast plate with the meat on the side to take home to the dog.  It's really good tasting and will fill you up for a nice price.  Otherwise, this Cracker Barrel is a great place to eat--just not really for us.  If you're not veggie, there's gonna be tons of great food here for you.

Didn't expect to come here, but we're glad that we did.  This is good, down-home cookin'.  It's similar in some ways to Denny's and similar restaurants, but more inviting and significantly less "corporate" in feel.  You won't find "The Bite" on a monitor here.  I had a simple burger and fries.  It was $5.99 and yummy.  I was tempted to get a dessert, but I was completely stuffed.  Service was friendly and attentive, and the place was spotless.  Taking a look on the internet, I found this place to be operating in Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming.  There's nothing like it out here in the Bay.  That's too bad, but the next time I'm in Arizona, I'll be sure to pay this place another visit.

Well, I can't say that I have experienced everything that this institution has to offer, but from my experience today, I certainly have a high opinion of this place.  I'm a teacher, who has just recently moved from California to Arizona.  I had been dealing with this institution remotely (by phone and mail) up to today, when I actually went into the building to get some credentialing paperwork processed.  From the moment I entered, I received nothing but friendly service.  The woman who processed my paperwork was fast, thorough and answered all of my questions.  I left with a provisional credential good until 2014 and a smile on my face.    In my time in Arizona, I have run into educators who are less than efficient in what they do.  I can't say that about the people that I dealt with at the Dept. of Ed.  Great folks--thank you very much for your willingness to be so helpful.

¡Sí!  My old stand-by phrase is, "A lot of places serve good Mexican food."  It's true--there are tons of places that will serve up a burrito or rellenos nice and neat, no problem.  And then, there's Mi Patio.  Do you ever get that feeling at the end of a meal where you are completely full but the food tasted so good that you want to continue eating?  That's how I felt here.  These were some of the best enchiladas I have ever tasted.  The rice was authentic, and I ate every speck of the beans.  I often don't finish the beans when I eat at a Mexican joint because they usually taste. . .blah.  No blah here--just REALLY good.  Distinct salsa flavor--more chips please!  My new favorite for Mexifood in the Valley.  There's good places closer to me, but for great, I'll travel a few extra miles to come here.

We were just introduced to the Jewish tradition of going to an Asian restaurant on Christmas by some friends of ours.  I understand that Chinese is apparently more "traditional" in this sense than Vietnamese, but I can think places far inferior than Da Vang to go to for this purpose.  Da Vang has a LOT more than just Pho (although they have just about every type and permutation of Pho possible), and the menu is chock full of all different kinds of Vietnamese cuisine.  I opted for a Vietnamese fried rice with pork sausage and chicken (which was quite good), and a type of Pho with beef brisket.  I really should have chosen the sliced beef over the brisket as I found the brisket pieces too tough to eat, although the Pho itself had a wonderful taste.  Service was good, prices are super low for the quantity of food, and my wife and I enjoyed our meals.  We'll be back, and we won't wait for Christmas 2012 next time. . .

I have to thank the "nearly famous" Barry Young Show on KFYI for telling me about this place.  On every one of their "wine and cheeseburger" Fridays they mention Steakenburger.  When my family and I were in the neighborhood recently, I was checking out to see what businesses were nearby on Yelp and I saw Steakenburger pop up at the top of the list.  We had just eaten a few hours before, but I immediately asked my wife, "Oooh, can we go to Steakenburger?"  My confused spouse wondered why I wanted to eat again, but was willing to drive us over so I could give this place a shot.  Didn't expect it to be like a fast food joint with a drive-thru and everything.  The biggest complaint that I have about this place is that the drive-thru must have taken in excess of 20 minutes from order to getting your bag of food.  This wasn't good, but the food was. I only got a single patty burger as I wasn't especially hungry.  The patty had a great grilled taste, but was overwhelmed by the really bready "artisan" bun.  Still enjoyable.  The fries were real potato, which is always a plus--nice and tasty too.  My daughter liked the fried pickles.  To be honest, I really didn't give Steakenburger as much of a chance that I could have.  A single burger just can't do it justice.  I'm going to give four stars for now.  I will be back when I'm extra hungry and ready to eat something big and juicy.  Details at 11. . .

This is my 500th review on Yelp, and I can't think of a better place to commemorate this occasion than for Hospice of the Valley.  We visited this facility to pay our respects to an in-law and family patriarch whose long life of 98 years was coming to an end.  He was receiving the best of care in a comforting, peaceful suite surrounded by his large extended family.  There are nurses and other staff always ready at a second's notice and they visit your loved ones frequently.  Health care equipment is present but not intrusive.  There is no cold "hospital" feeling and the suites have an additional bed present in case you need to stay for the night for any reason.   What makes Hospice of the Valley unique is that this place cares as much for the families of its patients as it does for its patients.  There are full facilities outside and inside for whole families to meet, eat and say goodbye to loved ones ready to move on.  Inside is a kitchen area, computer, television, couches, and dinner table.  Outside is a barbecue, gazebo with misters, small swimming pool, a swing set, fountain, and many tables and chairs.  Check out the pictures that I took.  My wife and I were very impressed by this facility and we wanted to let you all know that we would recommend this place whole-heartedly.  As Julia T. said below, this is a tough subject to discuss, and any family that has reached this stage with a loved one has a lot of painful and difficult decisions to make.  Hospice of the Valley, with this location, at least makes the period of waiting--the most painful time of all--much easier to deal with.

Just didn't work out for us. . .  We stopped by the drive thru Sunday morning to pick up two breakfast burritos.  My wife's had enough liquid in it to fill a small coffee cup.  It was about as hot as coffee as well and spilled down the front of her.  As she was driving at the time, it was a bit alarming to hear her yell in pain--frankly, I thought she was going to lose control of the car for a minute.  She ended up with a mild first degree burn on her stomach.  The burrito was BIG but only fair tasting.  After this experience, we're not sure if we want to return.  YMMV.

Yup, Fallas Paredes.  This place is to Ross what Ross is to a department store clothing shop.  Clothes here are CHEEP--we went there to buy clothes for my daughter so she could start her new school year off right.  We walked out with about 20 pieces of clothing plus a big plastic clock and and a broom for about $200.  Yup, it's a little dirty, and the non-clothing stuff can be absolute bottom of the heap Chinese-made garbage--check box contents thoroughly before purchase--but when you do find something pretty nice here, you get it for a great price.  No, there are no dressing rooms, but when you consider price and that you can at least take stuff back for up to a month after buying it for store credit, this place ain't bad at all.    Clothes don't really come cheaper than this unless you go to a garage sale or thrift store.  Haven't been here yet?  At least give them a try. . .

Rosa's--Just okay.  The opening chips and salsa was tasty and bottomless, but the salsa was definitely on the sweet side.  The food overall wasn't that bad, but nothing distinctive.  You get a fairly large plate of Mexifood in a pleasant atmosphere and pretty good service, but the taste is only average.  Frankly, there are a LOT of Taquerias, even Filiberto's at times, that have had better tasting grub than this, especially at the prices that they charge.  They don't charge an excessive amount, but dinner for three here cost over $60 with tip.  The taste of the food wasn't commensurate with the price--just to compare, another meal at the Filiberto's drive-thru in Tempe provided a similar amount of food with a better taste for $25.  Worth the 35 extra dollars to eat in?  No. Recommended?  No. Crappy?  No, but why not get food you really enjoy for less money elsewhere?

My wife has this tendency to suggest that I give Mexican restaurants a second chance if I give them a bad review on Yelp.  So, I gave Rosa's another try after panning them in 2013.   Holy crap, Is this the same place?  Maybe the chef was having a bad day when I was here a few years ago, but now, I would have to say that I'm a big fan of the food here.  The red sauce on that wet burrito was amazing, with a distinct, unique smoky flavor.  Okay, make that jump now from 2 stars to 4.  Definitely a place I'll be returning to when I'm in the neighborhood--maybe the next time my wife and I go to Fallas we'll go here for lunch or dinner afterwards.

Sometimes, the "big box" stores just don't cut it.  That's why you go to a place like this.  The Wallpaper Market is a small place connected to a fabric store (Creative Home Fabrics), but they have an incredibly diverse selection of colors, textures, and qualities available.  If you've got a few samples and/or some ideas, this place can turn your thoughts into the ideal look for your walls.  They have so many books to look through, plan to spend hours here--you'll need that time looking for just the right color or pattern.  Want fancy?  Really fancy? They got it, maybe for a very reasonable price.  They have lots plain stuff too, and everything in between.  Service was friendly, patient, and informative, with a lot of attention paid to the details about buying wallpaper that we DIDN'T know before.  This really saved us from making costly mistakes later on.    We like this place.  Never mind about "big box" hardware.  Here, it's 100% wallpaper and wallpaper expertise.  Go here instead.

Everyone reviewed on Yelp gets their first review.  It's time for Beadle Bug Patrol.  Allen Beadle came to the house that I was in the process of purchasing and gave everything a thorough, friendly once-over.  Turns out there's no visible trace of any damaging insects at my hopefully future property, but I appreciated his style and attention to detail.  If I do have any subsequent problems with insects, I'll be giving Beadle a try first.

They burned my eggs.  I never had a place burn my eggs before.  The Original Pancake House is a VERY retro-looking restaurant attached to a Motel 6 in the middle of Scottsdale.  The place reminds me of the joints that my parents would take me to for breakfast when we were on vacation somewhere.  I'd order breakfast, it wouldn't be all that good, and I'd have a slightly upset stomach for the next hour while we were driving to our next destination.  The food here is mediocre at best.  I always order my eggs over hard when I'm eating out.  The ones here came with a brown crust and were obviously overcooked.  I tried my wife's and they were soaked in butter--not good--I could feel the old upset stomach coming on again. . .  The potatoes here are a horror that need  to be experienced in order to believe them.  One bite yields up a mouth bitter with onion, garlic, and grease--no potato to discern.  Pancakes, being that they are part of the name of this place, are the specialty of the House.  My wife ordered the Dutch Baby.  She thought it was decent.  It wasn't my taste--reminded me of solidified custard.  The regular pancakes overall were good, but I could have made something like them myself with a pan and a box of Bisquick.  There just wasn't anything here that I could say was distinctive about this place at all--no real reason to put it on my breakfast rotation.  It's got blah food and nice service.  No, I'll pass on this one.

Really nice place.  My sister-in-law comes here for her timeshare and she let us use it for our trip to Phoenix this last Summer.  Our suite was quite big--essentially a one bedroom apartment.  There was a big bathroom there, sauna, swimming pool and hot tub outside, barbecues, wireless internet and a comfy bed.  It's a little far away from Phoenix proper, but being close to the freeway is a plus.  If you got the bucks to pay for this, then by all means splurge.  I thought it was a great spot to stay at.

Only went here once.  Really liked it.  Now, it's closed up tighter than a drum.  Yet another cool store that has now disappeared from the face of the planet. . .

How about a second five star review for Barry's Capezio?  My wife went here recently to get dance supplies for our daughter.  We are familiar with the Capezio name as we went frequently to their store in San Mateo, CA when we lived in the SF Bay Area.  Service here was as good as back home--very friendly and helpful.  Plus, they weren't pushy to try to get us to buy a bunch of stuff that we don't really need.  If you're looking for dance clothing/supplies in this part of the Valley, this is the spot.  Highly recommended.

When I lived in the Bay Area, there used to be more of this kind of antique shop--the kind where cases and alcoves are rented out by individual dealers.  This way, they can sell their wares in a "brick and mortar" building without having to plunk down the $$$ for their own shop.  I really like shops like this due to the huge amount and variety of antiques that you find in them.  Unfortunately, rents in the Bay Area have gone so sky high that places like this have begun to close--dealers can't even afford to pay the rent on a case anymore.  I am very glad to find one of these here in the Valley alive and well.  Lots of sports memorabilia, Beatles memorabilia, and old stamps and postcards.  I also saw several selections of old signage, jewelry, militaria, and coins.  I really need to visit this place regularly to see what comes in.  I could honestly wander through these aisles for hours.  You never know what could be behind the next corner. . .

What's the point, really?  In the San Francisco area, there used to be a metaphysical shop called "The Psychic Eye".  There are still Psychic Eyes in the Las Vegas area.  When they still had stores in the Bay Area, I used to go there, referring to it as "the Costco of Occultism" because they carried so much incredible stuff.  When I first stopped by the Vision Quest building, my first impression from seeing the outside was, "It looks like Psychic Eye!"  With that, I went inside, and my attitude changed from hopeful and curious, to confused, disappointed, and actually rather miffed.  Psychic Eye had EVERYTHING from bulk incenses and oils to books (the Crowley was in a locked cabinet) to magical blades to wall sconces(!) to jewelry and any kind of occulty paraphernalia you could or couldn't think of.  When I walked into Vision Quest, I was greeted by. . .bookshelves.  Lots and lots of bookshelves.  On these shelves, there were lots of copies of the same book laid face out for one or more rows so as to give them the illusion of looking full.  Had they been placed spine out, most of the bookshelves would have been substantially less than half filled, and the books that they did carry were largely crap.  I literally wandered from bookshelf to bookshelf looking for something interesting at each one, and was amazed at how few books of real quality I could find.  There was a small area in the center of the store with some crystals, and there was a case near the register with a little jewelry and some other non-descript stuff.  A few shelves and displays were also dedicated to 8 1/2 by 11 colored sheets of paper describing the specialties of the psychics and mediums who work at the site.  They aren't really selling crap here in the store, so this must be their main source of income.  This store is BIG, and really well-maintained.  They obviously put a LOT of money into the large Tarot card paintings that decorate the walls.  This place could be an occult powerhouse to rival Psychic Eye if they had the inventory to make it happen.  Instead, they have this huge, beautiful facility understocked with lousy books and a few crystals.  It was like using an ornate, sterling silver serving platter to serve a cold Quarter Pounder missing a bun.  On top of that, the sales lady just stayed by the register the whole time counting money.  We must have been in that store for 40 minutes, and all the while she didn't make eye contact, didn't even look up at us, didn't greet us, ask us if we needed help, or talk to us at all.   In addition, she had one music track playing on repeat over the speakers the whole time we were in there.  Vision Quest looks like it was really great at some time in the past.  Unfortunately, that time has come and gone.  From the terrible inventory to the non-existent customer service, few businesses say "get out" to their customers more than this.  What is the point, really?

A little better overall.    I went here again at the request of my wife today, and I was curious if there was going to be any improvement in this place since my last, horrible visit.  I can definitely say that the customer service was FAR FAR better--someone actually asked me if I needed help!  That was good.  The place felt quite a bit more alive than the last time I was here.  A recent review of this place by another Yelper described it as "a tomb."  Last time I was here, yes.  This time, at least at the time I visited, no.  But let's cut to the chase--the reason why you visit a bookstore is, well, BOOKS!  Customer service only goes so far if what you carry is no good (and this is true for many kinds of businesses.)  I have been to a number of metaphysical stores in my day both in California and Arizona, and this one still stinks in their book selection.  Sure, the fluff sells in bulk and you need to carry it.  But, you need MORE than that.  Either the owner or the book buyer or both need to visit Alpha Book Center, Fantasia, and Northern Winds in Phoenix to find out what kind of inventory a REAL METAPHYSICAL BOOKSTORE really has in stock.  This place has enough space to carry the full book inventory of all three of these stores combined--if it did, they'd get a LOT more business from Wiccans, New Agers, and Occultists of all different stripes who would go there to get the stuff they need.  Bulk herbs would be another nice addition--all they have are the same-old same-old incense sticks and oils.    Instead of aiming to be a provider to the metaphysical community in the Valley (and this is an ample community), they seem to be relying on their tarot card readers, psychics, authors, presenters, and aura photographers to bring in the bucks.  Good, but not good enough.  A little better overall.  Come on Vision Quest!  You guys have the space and the potential--now DO SOMETHING with it!

We went here last night at 9:00pm to get invitation cards for my daughter's birthday party printed up.  Service was courteous, fast, and we got exactly what we asked for.  This is one of those cases where I really can't write an elaborate review.  What I can say is that we needed a facility that could print a professional quality job for us off of a flash drive late at night.  They came through and neither my wife nor I have any complaints.  They did us right, and pretty much guaranteed that we will return for a similar job in the future.

I was really happy to find another vegetarian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  My wife and I enjoy Loving Hut, but it's always nice to find more variety.  We entered Green with high expectations considering the good reviews we saw here on Yelp.  I ordered a veggie burger (of course), my wife got a meatball po' boy, and my daughter got a rice bowl of some type.  There were also some appetizers such as egg(less) rolls, and their chili fries.  Chili fries--I looked forward with great anticipation to these, and it looks like I expected too much.  What passes for "chili fries" here are shoestring potatoes lightly sprinkled with thyme (not bad in themselves) which are then covered with a concoction of what appears to be Morningstar Farms veggie crumbles mixed with tomato sauce and one or two spices which I couldn't identify.  It was really not all that good.  It tasted like someone was trying to doctor up veggie crumbles and really didn't know how.  I'll say this much--it wasn't "chili" in any capacity that I would recognize.  In terms of the burger, I think that, at least at first, they did a good job of masking the blandness of the the red bean patty at the center.  The presentation and appearance was pretty nice.  However, by the time I took my last few bites, I was needing to wash it down with my Diet Coke.  Again, it was a not very successful attempt to make a meatless food attractive, hip, and tasty.  You can do it if you know how.  I'm not sure if the folks in the kitchen at Green really have a handle on it.  My wife's po'boy was a similar story.  Again, looked like Morningstar Farms meatless meatballs.  They put them in a bun with "mum's sauce" and soy cheese.  I tried a bite.  Tasted like a meatless meatball coated in ketchup on a bun.  The egg(less) rolls were. . .okay.  Again, there was something missing in the flavor.  The atmosphere was "hip" and cool.  The bathrooms were actually really neat looking.  Service was friendly and helpful.  The food was eh.  Don't be fooled into thinking that because they put up this big presentation and say with fanfare "WE'RE VEGAN!" means that the food here is good.  It's really mediocre and the only thing preventing it from being one star in my opinion is the work that they put into decor, atmosphere, and service.  If you want to come here with a friend, share a basket of thyme fries or a dessert, you probably won't be disappointed.  If you want a great meatless meal in the Phoenix area, however, the Supreme Master Ching-Hai has the lock on it.

A Tale of Two Pizzas in Scottsdale, Part II. . . . . .well, this is in north Tempe, but close enough.  Grrr.  I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area, where you can find good Italian restaurants all over the place.  I'm also Italian in heritage.  I have been eating and cooking Italian food for much of my life, and I know what it's like to mix ingredients in the right proportions to make a pasta sauce that needs at least five hours simmering time to taste just right.  I had passed Lo Cascio's many times on my way out of Scottsdale back to Tempe, and looked at the building with some anticipation--it looked a lot like some of the old Italian places that I grew up near.  Recently, I finally took my family out to eat at this place.  Upon walking in, I noted the distinctive decor on the walls that told me that this place specialized in Sicilian cuisine, and I was looking forward to that characteristic taste.  I ordered a pizza, remembering the taste of the very thin and incredible pie served to my father and I in Naples a decade ago.  I'm aware that Naples isn't in Sicily, but I was looking forward to real Southern Italian character to my dinner that night.  My wife ordered an eggplant parmesan, and my daughter opted for a simple cheese ravioli.  I was aware that my pizza was likely not going to have the same depth of flavor as the astounding one that I ate in Italy, but I was expecting something authentic and delicious.  What I got served to me was a f*cking frozen pizza--not even a name brand like DiGiorno's or Tombstone, but something on the level of the cheap, bargain frozen pizza that you find on the bottom shelf of the supermarket freezer.  You know, the one that's 2 for $7?  It was putrid.  Now, I have to admit that I have no proof that the pizza I got served was frozen, but I've had enough cheap pizza to know that bland, cardboardy taste.  Totino's tasted better for over $12 less.  I ordered a salad too--$5 for a handful of iceberg lettuce with two hunks of tomato and two god-damned olives.  My wife's eggplant parmesan was nothing special,  She ordered mixed vegetables with it.  Fresh?  Nope--Bird's Eye.  My daughter got served what I refer to as the "Italian Scam"--seven cheese ravioli in low-quality tomato sauce for $15.  Many Italian restaurants pull the Scam on you, because most of us are gullible enough to buy the bullsh*t that a plate full of noodles and sauce should be expensive because it's "I-TALYAN."  This just topped off a bad experience for us.  Good parts?  The bread wasn't "authentic", but was yummy and loaded with sesame seeds.  Service was fantastic, but that wasn't enough to save this place.  This place was an insult to Italian cooking in general, let alone Sicilian.  I don't care how many maps of Sicily they have around or how many triskelion heads they put on the walls and the menu, this joint ain't "Sicilian" in any meaningful sense of the word.  Lo Cascio's made this second-generation Italian-American very angry.  There are good pasta places around the Valley, but I would avoid this spot at all cost.

I just received a "compliment" tonight under the "You're Funny" heading from an individual named Leonardo M. concerning my review for this restaurant.  The "compliment" stated in whole:  "I guess your review was meant to be funny. Frozen pizza and Birdseye frozen vegetables? Iceberg lettuce?Italian from San Francisco? You may have been in Olive Garden or better yet Buca di Beppo. My mother is from Naples and my father from Sicily. We've spent time in both places. Maybe Italian food in SF has been too Americanized over the years. Sorry you had a bad experience?"  This Leonardo character has no reviews, no Yelp friends, and just started on Yelp this last September (2013).  A person with such stats wouldn't have any business or interest making a comment like that to me unless he was the owner, so I'm going to address this "compliment" to me as if I came from the owner.  So, no Leonardo, I wasn't trying to be funny.  Yes, I got a warmed-up frozen pizza for my entree and a tiny salad composed of iceberg lettuce for an additional $5.  My wife's mediocre meal had tasteless frozen vegetables on the side.  That's not funny.  You know what the sad thing is?  You didn't even try to make it better.  My family and I get one of the worst Italian meals of our lives, and all you felt motivated to do was insult me and my taste in food.  I grew up on restaurants like Westlake Joe's in Daly City, Bertolucci's in South San Francisco, Banchero's in Hayward, and a host of incredible Italian cooking from the North Beach area of San Francisco itself.  If you went to the owners of these restaurants and told them that their food was "too Americanized compared to yours", you would either end up with a spiffy pair of cement shoes, or at least with a horse's head on your pillow next to you the morning.  Okay, NOW I'm trying to be funny.  If this was just an off night, and you wanted to show me how good your food really was, you could have seriously apologized to me.  You could have invited my family back, served us up a wonderful meal, and I would have been back here on Yelp telling everyone to never mind about the previous bad review.  I would have been HAPPY to do that.  But no, you decided to insult me instead.  That's a shame--far more of a shame than just serving me a bad dinner.  All I can say now is that it appears that bad taste goes far deeper in this restaurant than just the food.  UPDATE 1/30/14:  The morning after I put up this review update, I received two more "compliments".  The first was by a man named "Robert K." from Chandler, someone who has no Yelp friends and about 40 reviews, who thought enough about what I wrote above to call me a "butt-hurt little child" at 6:27 am.  A response from Leonardo came about an hour later (and his name mysteriously changed to "Leonard").  He claimed that he wasn't the owner--just a "patron for several years" who never had that kind of experience at Lo Cascio's.  I won't buy that story any more than I'll buy food at this restaurant again.  UPDATE 12/6/14:  By this point, I have received a total of  five messages, "compliments", and even a counter-review, all negatively responding to this review and its previous incarnation.  Apparently back in September of 2013, another reviewer named "Denton S." from Tempe wrote a review for this restaurant where he called me a "condescending jerk", reacting with outrage because I had the temerity to call the bread "not authentic."  Again, another sock puppet Yelp account--one review and no other Yelp activity.  Thankfully, the review went straight into the "not recommended" section.  Another communication I got even seemed to imply that I had some kind of deep-seated anger issue, and with a "namaste", tried to tell me that my bad review was somehow harmful to my emotional and spiritual well-being.  Phew!  Look guy, I don't give bad reviews because I'm mean at heart--I give them because a business gives me bad service or a bad deal for my money.  You gave me and my family a sucky meal for $60+ bill, and for the past couple of years, you and/or some friends of yours have been finding ways on Yelp of insulting or belittling me because I gave your business a one-star review in return.  If my negative review were the only one, it wouldn't mean much.  However, my bad review Is one of a number of them from some quite upset people who disliked your food, your service, or both.  That's not my fault--it's yours.  Bad reviews are feedback telling you what you are doing WRONG.  It's supposed to tell you where  and how you can IMPROVE what you are doing.  Instead of doing that, you send me multiple messages calling me a jerk and a tool.  You sent it to me, and now I'm posting about it here for all to see.  Hope it's been worth it to you.

I must say that I really liked the Macayo's in Phoenix--I gave that place a good review.  This place though?  The food was good and filling.  I had shredded beef tacos with beans and rice.  The tacos were really dense and good-tasting.  I finished off the meal with sopapillas that were really tasty.  The problem came later.  Both my wife and I began to get gas and emit foul-smelling belches for hours after.  Neither one of us felt very good for the rest of the night.  It wasn't food poisoning, but there was lasting indigestion.  That was not good.    I would say the food is good, but the malaise that I experienced on my flight back to San Francisco would persuade me to steer clear of this place again.

Remember APS film?  I do--especially since I still have two undeveloped rolls of it from an old Europe trip a number of years ago.  The Walgreens near my house apparently has APS equipment, but they haven't used it in years and the guy there doesn't even know how to turn it on (or if it even works.)  What to do in a situation like this?  Call Tempe Camera.  While they'll charge you a fairly hefty price (over $30) for a service like this, they'll get the job done well.  Friendly, straight-forward service.  For the box full of disposable cameras that my wife has, I'll still head to Walgreens.  But to get those remaining APS rolls finally developed after 12 years, Tempe Camera will give me what I'm looking for.  Highly recommended.

Tasty.  Nice, sit down Mexican food place with very friendly service.  Lots of options available including veggie.  Somewhat outdated interior, but still pleasant.  Kudos to the server that got us a fresh chips and salsa refill BEFORE we asked for it.  Significantly better than your average Mexican joint.  Closed on Sundays.

Domino's?  Yeah, Domino's!  Gone are the past days of Domino's sh*tty pizza.  This stuff is pretty dang good now, and their online ordering system (even found on an iPhone app) makes it really easy to customize.  Taste?  Um, really good.  Their pizza with extra sauce and thin crust competes with some of the best tasting pizza I've had in recent memory.    You can also find a great deal online (via coupon) where you can buy two or more medium pizzas for $5.99 each.  Buy several of these and you can end up saving 50% on your family's dinner.  Plus, everybody gets the kind of pizza (toppings, etc.) that they want.  Yes, five stars, and I'm not the only one.  You've tried the others, now go back to Domino's and try them again.

Lots of BBQ places offer sides with their meals.  At Tom's, you get great ones, with an extra one thrown in for free--a side of service.  I've had Texas BBQ and New Orleans BBQ before--some places are good and others are eh.  This is the first time I have ever had Chicago BBQ, and this is definitely one of those rare spots to compare all others to.  Every bite was tender and tasty, and their sauce had the perfect balance of flavors.  Billie, the lady behind the counter, was really friendly.  When there were no orders to be taken, she was out on the floor shootin' the bull with us and it made for a really pleasant evening of food and conversation for both my wife and I.  Recommended?  Oh hell yeah.  Eventually, my wife and I are going to have to get back to vegetarianism after our long absence, but  places like this make what we have to do a bit harder.  When we finally do decide get back to the realm of bunny food, I have a good mind to come back here one more time and go out with a bang.

For the price, how can you top this place?  Me:  buzzcut. The wife:  hair color The price: about $75  Now, you'd think that a chain would be mediocre.  However, this place offers great quality hair services.  My wife was left with a little bit of a dark line at the top of her forehead, but her hair otherwise looks good.  We've been here several times and have always been pleased with the results.  We think you will be too.  Skip the fancy salon for once and give them a try.

This is the closest Burger King to where I live and we go here because BK is the only fast food place around that has a veggie burger for my daughter.  The problem with this place is their drive-thru.  You gotta check carefully every time you get your food to make sure you get everything you ordered.  More than once, I've brought bags full of food home to find that one or more things either didn't get entered in right or weren't given to me right.  Some places are right on and always give me what I order first time, no repeats.  This is not one of those places.  Grumble.

Yes, Church's.  There is no KFC in my neck of the woods and that's fine so long as this place is here.  Whenever I'm jonesin' for chicken, I come here for the strip meal and sides (the best deal really--all white meat, no bones, no mess).  They also have fried okra, which is a real plus.  The only real problem that I have with this place is how long it takes to get your food.  I've had it take up to 15 minutes.  Once you get home and taste that chicken however, you forget about all that.  Great comfort food.  If you're a little depressed, there's nothing that Church's chicken, potatoes, and a little mac 'n' cheese can't fix.  Enjoy!

Tired of the same old thing, my wife approached me one weekend morning and told me that she wanted croissants for breakfast.  Out comes the iPhone where I'm going to the Yelp app.  Yup, here we go, P. Croissants.  Nice, tidy place, with treats sweet and savory.  Why go to Burger King for their greasy croissants when you can get an egg, bacon and cheese croissant freshly made and tasty here?  Comparable price too.  If sugary stuff is what you're looking for, they've got it down.  You can get sweet crescents here made up like fancy donuts--many different kinds.  There's also salads and fruit pastries.  Fast, friendly service, surrounded by French ambiance..  The place is popular, so if you go at certain times, there might be a wait in line.  There's plenty of seating in and outside, though.  Next time you're in the mood for breakfast out, skip the pancakes and come to Pleaissant Croissant Patisserie, The Perfect Pastry.

I'm starting to get kind of burnt out on the Asian buffets around town, but if I'm going to go to one, this is my pick.  The facility is a bit worn down, but the selection is incredible and it's a great bang for your buck if you're hungry or watching your budget.  You know that restaurant that serves ONE plate of fried shrimp and french fries for $11.99?  Pay less than that here for lunch and get bottomless shrimp and fries plus anything else you want, as much as you want.  From Pizza slices to sushi, it's all here.   Yes, it's greasy, but you'll leave full.  Do it.  You know you want to. . .

Yeah!  Kickass Asian fast food!  No "bobo plates", no little sterno grill to burn your own food, no 70s "Oriental" restaurant ambiance.  This is the REAL THING.  Just knock your socks off, FRESH Asian cuisine to please many palates.  Want veggie?  There's LOTS of vegetarian options for you made to order and brought to your table fast.  Chinese?  Sure.  Japanese?  That too.  They even have pho and curry plates.  You'll get a satisfying mound of food for $10 including bottomless drink.  My only caveat: don't bother having a big conversation with the person you may be eating with--this place is LOUD.  That's okay--you'll have too much fun eating to want to talk that much.  Look, I'm from the SF Bay Area, where Asian joints abound.  This place would totally outdo a lot of the spots back home if it were in the Bay.  Best Asian spot so far that I've been to in the Valley.  If there's a better one, I have yet to find it.  Go.  Eat.  Stuff thyself.

This was a welcomed stop in the Valley.  Out here on the Peninsula, you've got about 70 7-11s, 25 am pms, and about 5 Circle Ks.  In the Valley, the 7-11 to Circle K ratio is reversed, and the 7-11s have gas stations too.  However, the Valley also has QuikTrip, which is a jumbo-size convenience store/truck stop with about 12 kinds of soda and a choice of cube or crushed ice.  They also have about 8 slush drinks.  Tons of junk food rounds out this place.  Awesome for road trips, to wet your whistle, or to gain a few pounds.  Recommended.

Not bad at all!  We all know that there are a ton of hotel/casinos to choose from in Vegas, on and off the Strip.  In general, the more you pay, the better the quality.  If you're looking for a comparatively inexpensive but decent hotel and casino in Vegas, look no further than the Golden Nugget.  The rooms are certainly a little worn, but quite well maintained.  The floor has quite a lot of space, and a good number of slots, tables, and places to sink your $$$ in style.  I had pretty good luck with the 25 cent machines this time. The buffets here aren't cheap, but the food selection, especially for the Sunday Brunch, was impressive.  They also have a pool with a multi-story water slide, a vending machine that dispenses gold, and no matter where you are in the hotel, you're never far from a drink.  Minuses?  It's smoky, although that's de rigueur in all the casinos around.  Now really though guys, THREE DOLLARS for a bottle of Dasani water out of the vending machine?  Stupid!  You can get a deck of used playing cards for a dollar, but a 20 oz bottle for water for three?  Sheesh.  I could go around quibbling about a dozen things, but what I really need to be focusing on in this review is how GOOD the Golden Nugget really is--and there's a lot if awesome here.  Looking for a spot in Vegas that won't break the bank (unless you let it)?  Want to bring the kids too?  Try the Golden Nugget.

My wife and I first discovered Metro Pizza when we met in Las Vegas in December of '06.  The pizza there was so fantastic (we had the "Gotham") that when we were married here in March of '08 we needed to find the place again.  Are we glad we did!  This time we had the "Stockyard", a stuffed pizza with pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, and dipping sauce on the side.  It was so big that we could only eat one piece each.  What was left over made up about three meals over the next couple of days.    My wife and I have decided to make a pilgrimage to Metro Pizza annually as a great way to celebrate our anniversary.  These guys have a lot more than just pizza and I am looking forward to trying the other stuff on their menu.    You gotta go here on your next trip to Vegas!

It's a tradition!  I first met my wife in Vegas just about exactly seven years ago and this one of the places where we went to eat.  We were engaged about a year later.  Whenever we come to Vegas, we always come here to eat.  We either have the Gotham (see my recent picture series), or the Stockyard.  If you are on vacation in Vegas, please be sure that your hotel room has a refrigerator. because you are going to need it unless you have a monster appetite.  Rockin' pizza!  Fabulous service makes it even better.  If this joint is good enough to be a landmark in our marriage, I think you'll love it on your next trip to Sin City.  Make eating here one of the sins you're allowing yourself while visiting.  If you can, bring home leftovers--this is something that doesn't have to stay in Vegas.

This is where my wife and I got married on 3/21/08.  Let me give you guys the rundown.  First, the price was pretty darn good--about half of what you would pay at one of the hotel/casinos on the Strip.  They don't have a casino, and that's fine for us.  The room was a two story unit with a jacuzzi tub halfway up the stairs.  It was like a little apartment and we really loved it.  Room service was fine, but one of the cleaning people took the top off of the complementary bottle of champagne that we were given for our wedding--this was disconcerting.  The hotel replaced it for no charge.  The one thing that I would not recommend is the restaurant in the lobby.  The menu was pretty monotonous and lacking in variety.  The steak I had was good but fairly fatty.  The vegetables were dry and flavorless, and the "jasmine rice" had no jasmine, only butter.  There was only one server, and service was pretty sparse despite the fact that there were few people in the restaurant at the time.  Overall, we had a wonderful experience at the Alexis Park and will go back.  I just recommend to all people going there:  1.  Watch your stuff  and  2.  Eat somewhere else.

After our wonderful experience here in March '08, we decided to give the Alexis Park another go.  We almost wish we didn't.  We weren't here 30 minutes when our car was broken into in the parking lot.  This REALLY sucked big time.  This place is not in a very good neighborhood and if you park near the front, your car is vulnerable.  The security service is sparse (only a couple of guys) and watches two hotels at the same time.  To make matters worse, my wife went into the hot tub to calm her nerves, and a broken spigot on the jets started spraying water down to the lower level, almost ruining my laptop and getting all over the room television.  In addition, we were paying for a room that had a fireplace, only to find that this building and five others in the complex didn't have gas.  To top it off, the toilet downstairs just kept running and running and you had to fiddle with it inside the tank in order to get it to stop.  Chipped paint on the banisters and intermittent internet only served to make a shabby room seem even shabbier despite the ornate initial impression.    The hotel credited us one night and found us another room that had fewer features, the same chipped paint, another broken hot tub spigot, but, lo and behold, a working fireplace--what a gas.  We decided not to make the change.  All together, we lost a night's sleep, my GPS unit, my wife's dress coat, and my stepdaughter's Christmas presents--about $600 worth of stuff, plus another $280 getting my window replaced, and the hotel manager just smiled and said that he wasn't responsible--whatever.  I WON'T be coming back to this place.  It is absolutely sucktastic.  Whatever you get in low rates just isn't worth this garbage.

Okay.  So my wife and I pull into the auto glass repair shop to get my driver's side window replaced (some &*^%&# broke it and stole about $600 of stuff from my car).  While waiting, we started looking for a place to eat and found this place.  Crown and Anchor is an AUTHENTIC English pub, right down to the kidney pie and the smoky atmosphere.  It was great comfort food--at that time we needed some comfort and this place served up some great food and drink.  We could have done without the smokiness, but that was a small price to pay for a good meal.  Highly recommended.

Nice place for coffee.  Apart from their quality (which would be enough to draw people anyway), they are also next to Butters.  This enables them to sell coffee to folks waiting on Saturday and Sunday morning for a seat at one of the best breakfast joints in the Valley.  Although the Roastery would no doubt prefer that people eat their food (and they do appear to have a substantial menu of items beyond the requisite pastries), I'm sure they in no way resent the spillover.    If you do decide to eat here on Sunday morning, at least you won't get the 30 minute wait for a seat.  Meal or coffee, either way, you're probably going to be pleased with your choice.  The live music is another plus.

Fancy food.  I don't generally eat food like this, but when you visit Vegas, places like this abound.  Every hotel/casino has at least one of these places with the "executive chef" and composed plates with an entree and sides.  Spots like this run on the border between restaurant and modern art gallery in terms of how your meal is prepared.  The "art", in this case, is the chef's food--there's no quibbling about the high price because you're not there to fill your stomach like you would at Denny's. You're there to experience the chef's taste creations.  It's going to be expensive and you know that going in--this really isn't an issue unless the food is awful.  *Hold that thought*  We started with clam chowder.  Actually, it was more like a lukewarm bisque, and had a bitter cast to it.  Not really my style.  The skirt steak entree I ordered consisted of about seven smallish pieces of meat laid on a bed of creamy mashed potato with mushrooms and "yumyum" sauce.  The sauce had the heat of a hot salsa and made the potato "yuckyuck"--it was inedible.  The steak was tasty-- I just cut each slice in half as I ate it so I could have the illusion that I was eating more food.  I also got a ten dollar serving of french fries--these were just about as spicy hot as the mashed potatoes, but if I didn't eat them, I would have had a near empty stomach.  My wife got a seafood plate--the Surf and Surf.  She said that it was "good"--nothing special.  My daughter filled up on Caesar salad.  In total, $200 for "okay" food or food so heavily spiced that I couldn't enjoy it.  Yeah, it was pretty awful, and what's the point of fancy if you don't enjoy it?  Speaking very frankly, I seriously wish that I skipped the art gallery and gone to Denny's.

T. C. Eggington's.  We found this place with my iPhone one morning while looking for brunch.  The ratings were good, so we decided to give them a try.  We walked in and had kind of a U. S. Egg experience: no sooner did we enter than FIVE consistently dressed and made-up women (some in shorts, some with blond hair, and ALL in pink-dominated pastels) turned their heads to greet us in a Stepford fashion.  One led us to a table in the back of the restaurant.  The surreal combination of this, menus with chicken wire inset into them, a long table next to us filled with 60-plus diners, and "Like a Fool Believes" playing over the restaurant speakers had me in a fit of uncontrollable laughter.  The menu was so full of puns like "hens forth", and "egg cetera" that I was almost too distracted to order my food.  However, I did settle on a stack of pancakes and sharing an order of french toast with my wife.  Frankly, I thought they only served pancakes THIS BIG at truck stops out around Kingman.  These things are gigantic.  Taste?  Best I've had in a restaurant--and I've had lots of pancakes in restaurants.  Order a stack here, and you'll have enough breakfast for two to three days afterwards--getting your money's worth is always a good thing.  Same for the French Toast--big portions, WOW taste.  This is the place you bring visitors from out of town when you want  to take them to have breakfast or brunch out.  The next morning, you can have breakfast or brunch IN, with the same food.  T. C. Eggington's is the ultimate breakfast joint in the Valley.  Go.  Just. . .go.

That was. . .amazing.  Great reviews of Eden's Grill Inn are nothing new, and if you've been there, you probably aren't surprised to see this.  If you haven't been there, then I have a few things to tell you about this place:  1. The high reviews aren't hype--this really is one of the best places to eat in the Valley.  2. You haven't had kabobs until you have had them here.  No, that's not trite--it's quite true.  Get your steak kabobs medium rare.  Do it. They are an experience to behold.  Even the basmati rice is remarkable.  3.  Imagine the most delicious, warm, rich apple pie you could ever have.  Now, project that richness of taste to a baklava.  You can have it here.  4.  No matter what you order here, you will love it.  Yes, you will.  Worth driving across the Valley to eat here.  Nuff said.

Like Indian food? Like veggie? I've got a place for you!  If you're one of the V people, you know that finding a good place for your eating preferences is not always easy.  Sometimes you'll look through a menu dominated by meat dishes for one or two items that are all starch and grease.  At Udupi, you have an all-vegetarian menu with a TON of vegan options.  Delicious.  If you order something with batura, you're going to get a MASSIVE poof of bread brought to your table with your entree that will definitely leave you with leftovers.  Want another kind of bread?  That's a naan issue--they have MANY different flavors and varieties of naan to choose from.  Take your pick.  At some point in the past, a number of Yelp reviewers made complaints about the cleanliness of this place.  Those days are apparently quite long gone.  Everything was clean as a whistle and service with fast and smiling.  You even get a special copy of the Coffee News with your meal.  This is another spot to put on your list of "must go" vegetarian joints in the Valley.  I'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy it.

It's called "chaat".  Apparently, this means "street food".  Sounds good to me.  The first time I ever heard this term was when I started to look into this restaurant.  I found out about this place from looking here at Yelp and seeing the high ratings.  When we walked in, I was asking myself where the restaurant was.  To find it, you go into the back of this little market and there are a few tables and chairs.  You order by grabbing a card, ticking off the food you want and giving it to the server.  By looking at the pictures on the wall, the meals don't seem that big.  Seeing them in person after they are served doesn't help either.  But, eating is believing--you get a LOT of delicious food for your money here.  May I recommend the Chole Bhature?  It's spiced chick peas in sauce with two BIG pieces of flat bread to eat it with.  This will fill you up fast for $5.25.  No meat here in the dishes.  There's cheese, but all the food here is otherwise veggie.  No matter--you'll enjoy it anyway.  This is another five star review for Little India.  Don't pass this place up.

I never reviewed this place?  Sheesh, what kind of Yelper am I?  When I heard Ween being played over the speaker, I knew that this place was something special--someone's got some character here.  The metal menus also caught my attention.  The Cornish Pasty Company specializes in Britain's answer to the calzone, and they do it in a delicious way.  You can get your dough stuffed a large variety of ways--from traditional shepherd's or cottage pie, to Italian and even Indian. Friendly service.   They have something for every taste, so stop by, order a tall one, and dig into one of their flaky creations.  No need for formality--just come as you are, relax, and get into the vibe of this unique spot.

Kind of a cross between a thrift shop, an antique furniture shop, a furniture consignment shop, and a regular furniture dealer.  Their showroom is a huge selection of used furniture ranging from used particle board crap to serious antiques 100+ years old.  You never know what you are going to find.  For that alone, it's worth going here.  But wait, there's more!  You can order new furniture too--right up to the finest commercially available--at the lowest prices anywhere.  The quotes we were given had deep price cuts.  They are now holding our order until we can get our home remodel finished.  We liked the service, as well as the sense of adventure every time we visit.  It's HUGE.  Don't come in here looking for things to be nice and neat and orderly--stuff comes in and stuff goes out--they don't have time for that crap.  Never mind about pretty, but if you're looking for a deal or for maybe something unusual, GO HERE.  Want to order new furniture?  Don't go to prim and proper Ethan Allen with a carpet and air conditioning and an employee who will take your credit card with a manicured hand as she charges you full retail price.  At J&K, floors are concrete.  Maybe someone kicked in a cigarette butt from outside.  It's ungodly hot during the summer in there.  Sit down, sweat, look in the catalog, and get some of the lowest prices in the Valley.  It's worth it--it's worth it to drive halfway across the Valley to get here.  Down and dirty and cheap, with no pretense--that's J&K.

Oh yeah.  So, my wife suggests that we go to this "Oriental Buffet" place that's next door to India Oven in Mesa.  Now, all she has to do is mention "India Oven" and I'm about ready to go.  However, she wants to introduce me to this place and I grudgingly consent.  I've been to Asian buffets before--I'm from the Bay Area and we gots Asian buffets all over the place.  They range from pretty good to disgusting, and I was just hoping that this one was decent.  I walk in, and I'm amazed at how BIG this place is.  And then I see the food--this is the largest Asian buffet that I have ever seen.  They have fried rices to Mongolian beef to sushi to dim sum to salad.  Plus lots of dessert.  The food just keeps going and going. . .  Looked real good--I packed up two plates.  Just about everything tasted terrific.  They only thing I didn't like all that much was the BBQ beef.  That's okay.  Potstickers?  OMG.  The dim sum was fantastic, and the Mongolian beef is something I would go out of my way to recommend.  This place beats any Asian buffet I went to in the Bay.  Usually, the Bay sets the standard for me, but this place in Mesa comparatively puts them all to shame.  Fill up your stomach here for $9 and have fun eating!  They even have Diet Mountain Dew in their beverage selection.  Next time we're in the area, will it be India Oven or Oriental Buffet?  Now THAT'S gonna be a tough decision. . .

Only three stars?  Wow--maybe it was the ambiance that sucks overall here--I don't know.  I actually didn't go here myself.  It was my wife.  She brought me home a cheese enchilada plate and it hit the spot--even lukewarm.  All I know is that meal was better as a leftover than a lot of the fresh ones I've had at taquerias around the tri city area.  Makes me wonder how it would taste if it were nice and hot. . .  Okay--challenge accepted.  I'll let you know.

Another tradition that my wife and I have when we visit Vegas is for us to get a full mani-pedi while we are there.  I was thinking about one of the 24/7 spots at night, but the reviews on those are so spotty that I started looking elsewhere.  After doing a Yelp search, I found this place.  Service was very friendly.  So far, my wife's toes still look great (nice artwork) and her fingers are still pretty good after a couple of days--that's better than average.  They're going to have to do a lot to measure up to Colorful Nails in Tempe, AZ (our regular place now), but it was still a pretty good place to relax for a few hours in a massage chair.  Thanks folks.  The next time we visit Sin City, we may just return.

For what it is, this place can't be beat.  No, not every item at this buffet represents top-quality grub, but the steaks are real nice and you can eat as many as you can get and not pay a penny over the entry price.  Beats Sizzler like crazy.  Even beats Black Angus for overall steak taste.  I'm not too big on the homemade potato chips or the breaded bacon, but that's the good thing about Golden Corral--if you don't like something, don't eat it!  There's a ton of other things that you WILL like.  Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you will always leave stuffed and happy.  Vegetarian?  They can do that.  Want food to go?  They can do that too.  It's loud, always crowded, the servers always have a smile, and it has acres of  food from opening salads and soups down to cakes, pies and a chocolate fountain.  Great place to take your family for a full belly, lots of fun, and not a lot of $$$.  With the closing of places like Bishop's and Luby's, this place represents one of the last places of its kind--but I don't think it will be closing down anytime soon.  it's too popular, and too good!

Sheesh.  My wife thought this place had some cute things and would have liked to have stayed longer, but the smell of scented oils and candles in here was so intense that it started to give us both headaches.  We looked around for about three minutes, and then my wife said, "okay we have to go."  Out we went.  She could still smell and taste all of the perfumes in her system for several minutes after leaving.  Why do people think that scents and smells that intense are a good thing?  YMMV, but my wife and I can't take strong perfumes and odors, especially chemical-laden artificial ones.  If you're sensitive to this stuff too, please steer clear of this place.

Pretty good pizza actually--I'm shocked.  I used to take my daughter over to Chuck E. Cheese when we lived in the Bay Area and the pizza there was a friggin' joke.  This place has all the games and stuff that you would find at Chuck E. Cheese, but the pizza here is like ambrosia in comparison.  Tasty sauce, substantial and good-tasting crust, fresh toppings--yes, here the pizza isn't an afterthought to the games, the tokens, and the ticket redemption area.  If it wasn't for all the kids running around and the noise, I'd probably come here more often and just order pizza.  My daughter informed me after taking her to a classmate's birthday party here that she still prefers the pizza over at CEC's  Well, at least my wife and I can tuck into a nice pie while she plays games.  That and bottomless drinks--works for me.

Holy crap!  Um, wow.  Never saw a store like this before.  Kind of part hardware store, part survivalist store, part specialty item store, and part toy store for adults.  There's stuff here I've only seen in print and online catalogs before--never in person.  From air compressors to auto supplies to home security equipment to workshop supplies to powerful magnets to solar power arrays to etc. to etc. to etc., this place has everything you can't find at the other stores.  My wife and I were looking around at several stores for a can crusher.  No dice, until I took the advice of someone at Fry's who suggested Harbor Freight.  They actually had two to choose from, and the clerk I asked told me which of the two was of better quality.  I also found one of those electric bug zappers that looks like a tennis racket.  From there, I just wandered through aisle after aisle saying to myself, "OMG, they have THIS here?"  I was practically salivating at some of the stuff, and if I had the money I would have walked out with a cart full and more.    When Walmart and Home Depot leave you disappointed in your quest to find object X, you will likely find it here, and at rock bottom price.  Before you go online and pay the shipping cost for that specialty item, give this place a gander first-- they may just have it.  If you like gadgets and thingamajigs, and you haven't experienced this place yet, it's high time.

Old spot, I mean REALLY old, still having that look like time stood still here since the '70s.  The decor (including the lifesized cardboard John Wayne) is super rustic.  The food is truly home-cookin'.  There's nothing fancy about it really at all but it will fill you up nice.  You kind of get the feeling like someone's mom cooked it up just for you right there.  It's decent--with a surprisingly large selection of food from burgers to Mexican to fish to breakfast available anytime.  Nice service.  If you're driving down the road, and you're looking this spot up to see if it's any good, you can rest assured from me that it's fine for you or your family.    Nothing's wrong with a good, cheap bite--if you are of the same mind, you'd like this place too.

The previous review from 2/19/11 admittedly makes this place look absolutely ghastly.  If we had an experience like that, my rating would have been the same.  Of course, considering that the reviewer has no friends and only this solitary review, I wonder why it was allowed to stay up and hundreds of others that I've seen like it have been filtered. . .    Our experience of Good Night Pediatrics was quite good.  We went there because we suspected that our daughter was coming down with the chicken pox.  The place was empty when we arrived, and we got to see a doctor in only about 10 minutes or so.  No problems, no worries, and thankfully, no chicken pox.  The service was fine all around and the facility was clean and well-maintained.  Considering that our daughter is about to turn 12, it is unlikely that we are going to be coming here much in the future.  This one experience, however, left us with a good impression.  Recommended.

The difference between this place and Joann's is about the same as the difference between a gourmet steak restaurant and McDonald's.  Yes, Joann's has lots and lots of accessories and hobby stuff just like McDonald's will sell you chicken or fish or fake "McRib" or a hamburger.  Creative Home Fabrics is almost exclusively fabrics for upholstery, bedspreads, drapes, etc.  Heavier stuff--not cheap knits with cheesy patterns.  It is absolutely high quality, in just about any pattern you could want, or close to it.  The rolls go up the walls, and up the racks, and you wind around corner after corner and nook after room with rolls and rolls of fabric.  Want something bright and sunny for your outdoor umbrella?  They've got choices!  Remember that weird fabric that Aunt Josephine had for her drapes when you used to visit her house in 1975?  If they don't have the pattern, you'll find something really close!  You may just get flashbacks. . .  Service is friendly and knowledgeable.  Go and look around!  If you don't see what you're looking for, just ask.  The Wallpaper Market is in this store as well--don't forget to look there too.

Very friendly service here--I started this review about a year ago and never finished it.  However, I now have another chance.  This morning, my wife awoke with pink eye and a frown on her face.  A call to The Eye Center and Dr. Stacy and they were able to squeeze my wife in on short notice.  The infection wasn't too bad, and won't get any worse because he was able to get her a prescription for antibiotic eye drops.  Dr. Stacy has always given us great service and is my choice for eye care in the Valley.  I am eventually going to need new glasses one of these days and when the time comes, I'll be stopping by his office again.  Five stars--enthusiastically recommended.

Okay, is there something going on with fast food places in the Valley?  Or is it all over?  Places seem to be doing something with their meat that I am not liking.  Some kind of greasyspicymuddy taste has invaded burgers from Wendy's and Jack in the Box and I'd like to know WTF is going on here.  I used to really like Jack's Ultimate Cheeseburger, and the Jumbo Jack has been a favorite of mine since the '70s.  Now yuk.  Something has changed.  It's almost like they are trying to duplicate some greasy freshly barbecued taste and failing BADLY.  I hope you guys don't change your tacos or egg rolls or I won't have much of a reason to go anymore.  If I need a fast burger, I'll go to McD and get a burger there.  They'd never change.  Of course, they changed Coke, so I guess I shouldn't say never. . .

A few weeks ago, I saw a kid at lunch at my school with a "seriously" big slice of pizza.  I asked him where he got it and he showed me the soda cup that came with it.  Jimmy & Joe's eh?  Gotta try that place. . .  Okay.  Today I did.  I got their Special #1, which is a "serious slice" of pizza and a bottomless drink.  The pizza wasn't the best I've had, but it was a pretty damn big slice.  For $5, this was a good deal.  They apparently also offer a 25 inch pizza here for about a $1 per inch, and they also deliver, which is a plus.  Great, I found a place near my work where I can fill myself up for $5 and refill my drink one last time to go. . .sounds like lunch to me.

Great selection!  Didn't expect to come in here at all.  We were visiting another store looking for furniture when we saw this shop nearby.  Our expectations were low, but this place turned out to be a home decor gem.  It's packed to the brim with accessories and furniture of many types--some quite unexpected.  There's something here for all tastes, from cheesy to sophisticated, from conventional to eclectic.  Check it out.

Thought this place would be great considering the other reviews.  I give them a C on my wife's pedicure, a C on her acrylic fills, and an F on my pedicure.  Her toes looked fine for about a week or so, but are already starting to chip--not so good.  My wife is also very particular about the way she likes her acrylics--rounded square, lightly tapered.  They really didn't listen to her, plus, they left some rough edges at the corners.  What really irked her was the repeated attempts to upsell her on getting gel polish on top of the acrylic for an additional $15.  My wife used to be a nail tech years ago, and she knows that this is just a waste of money.  My pedicure left me in a considerable amount of pain.  After putting my feet in COLD water, my tech, who couldn't really understand me very well, noted my healing ingrown toenail and seemed to be concerned about hurting me, but then proceeded a minute later to jam the toenail cutter so deep under my left big toe that she drew blood.  Ow.  Over a week later and there is still a scab there.  No, we won't be returning.  This place seems to have a lot a satisfied customers, but we are not in that number.

As opposed to the previous review of this company, I had nothing but a positive experience of this business.  My inspector's name was Steve Bartolomei, and he put a considerable amount of time inspecting my hopefully future home.  After compiling his information and taking his photos, he condensed everything into an easily readable report that my wife and I could read at our leisure.  He even took the time to go over with me all of the areas in his report where he thought there was an area of concern.  His fee was quite reasonable, and he answered my many and varied questions about the property thoroughly.  Very professional and friendly service.  Many thanks to Steve and J. Dewey Property Inspection.  You guys are all right by my book.

Interesting. . .  This is one strange freakin' place.  There's all kinds of Anime-type robot art here as well as other accessories/vinyl-type toys.  Not my taste in artwork, but definitely a place to visit and look around.  If you're looking for smorkin' labbits, you'll find them here.  If you come to Red Hot Robot and haven't been to Smeeks yet, it's just next door and you'll find all the candy you'll ever want.  Entrance in back.

Four things to know about California Pizza Kitchen:  1.  The food is delicious.  I used to call this place "California Pizza Sh*ttin" around the year 1999 when I tried the food back then.  I didn't like the taste 14 years ago, but I think their grub is pretty awesome now.  Tasty margherita pizza.  My wife, who had never been to a CPK before, was also very impressed not only with her pizza but also her salad.  My daughter really enjoyed her pasta.  2.  The service is fantastic.  Our waitress was very friendly, helpful, and present--and that's exactly what we needed along with great food at the end of a stressful day.  3.  It ain't cheap.  You don't go here for a bargain.  It won't break your bank, but this is upscale pizza, and a deluxe meal for your family of three could approach $70.  4.  It's LOUD.  Between the music, and people shouting to be heard over the music, this place is updecible and well as upscale.  It's like a warzone soundwise.  Be warned.  Great dinner.  The coupon and gift card we had helped a lot with the bill.  Yes, definitely recommended.

Absolutely, positively, the GO TO place for Mediterranean Food in this part of the Valley.  I just had a falafel pita there for lunch today that was incredible and filling--just the right amount of tahini to give it zing.  From their sunbuseks to their red lentil soup, nothing there is to be missed.  The baklava is about as good here as I've ever tasted it anywhere.  Service is always friendly.  It's not a long review because there isn't much more to say.   My whole family enjoys eating here.  This place rocks, and most of the other reviewers you'll read for this place agree with me.  Try it for yourself.

What a concept--a movie theatre that doesn't charge you $70 for a movie, food, and drinks for a family of 3.  Okay, you're not going to be seeing the newest releases, but for the price, this place is unbelievable.  The movies are generally $3, and the food is cheaper than Harkins.  You can also get refills on drinks and popcorn, unless you go to the late-night screening and the concession stand is closed when you get out.  Really cool ambiance at this place (look at the pictures).  For budget-conscious families wanting to go to the movies, forget about going to Tempe Marketplace and forgoing all food and drinks.  Go here, see a flick, get your junk food, and relax.

Cool, a step up from Subway.  With Entertainment Book coupons in hand, we walked in not knowing what to expect.  I'm really glad we did--these guys make a hell of a tasty sammich.  The banana peppers (which I really love) are a little hotter here than the ones they use as Subway, and the sammiches overall tasted fresher and better.  Two more pluses--they deliver (for a charge), and they're open until 3am.  Nice.  I have found my new sandwich shop.

Pissed me and my wife off.  I understand that the delivery person has a tight schedule, but this is BAD.  Every once in a while, we order a sandwich from here.  Most recently, we ordered one for our daughter to get delivered to our house.  Apparently, our daughter didn't hear the doorbell ring when the guy arrived at the house (she is hearing impaired).  When my wife didn't immediately pick up the delivery guy's phone call, he moved on to his next delivery--I get this.  However, when my wife called him back a minute later, the guy refused to redeliver the sandwich, saying that he didn't want to waste his time.  Interesting.  Our doorbell is loud and plays for an extended amount of time--I'm surprised that she didn't hear it (she hears it every other time there's a delivery-why not from Silver Mine?)  We were also very surprised at the reaction from the delivery guy.  Again, I completely understand that he's got a lot of deliveries to take all over town, but his attitude really sucked eggs.  You don't refuse service from a paying customer, period.  The guy at the store tried to make excuses for him, but we weren't really having it.  The sandwich did eventually get redelivered, but it took a phone call to the shop to do it.  Not acceptable.  It's not the cheapest place to order a sandwich from--we like it because the sandwiches are high quality.  It's not worth it we get treated like this, though.    We want food, not 'tude.  Got it?

I was really happy to find a 24-hour Mexican joint nearby.  The service was friendly, the ladies there really nice, the food tasted like just about all the other Mexican places nearby (Whateveriberto's, El Favorito, Rivas'), but was really good and filling.  Why two stars?  Well, it started with my  wife getting up in the wee hours afterwards having to spend a considerable about of time on the loo--it was the food she ate at Amado's--right through her, and quite painfully.  I wasn't happy about this, and was even more upset when I began to purge myself--from the other end. . .  I know this is TMI, but I can't sufficiently express the agony involved in vomiting up ANYTHING containing chili powder.  Oh my God. . .  It really is too bad.  I would have really liked to come here again.  The food was delicious. . .the first time around only.  Unfortunately, we are going to avoid Amado's in the future.

I need to revise my review of this place.  The food has actually improved greatly in the past months and I need to let everyone know that am recommending this place again.  I keep coming back because this is one of the few 24-hour spots around and pretty much the only place aside Denny's and IHOP in the immediate vicinity to get late night grub.  They now have a drive-thru and are being renovated so things are looking much better here as well as tasting better..  When they finally finish working on that scary-looking men's bathroom, I'll be even happier. . .

Nice little place. I'm not a big gyro fan but my wife likes them and thought that this place made really good ones.  I had the fried chicken strips and I thought that they were overdone, but they still had a good flavor.  Their fries were incredible.    What I really liked about this place was how friendly and efficient the service was here.  We got good recommendations on the dishes that they serve and we were even thanked when we were ready to leave.  The facility is clean and attractive--overall a really great place to eat.  I will be coming back on my next visit to the Valley.

Good--nice solid service.  These guys knocked themselves out cleaning my cars.  There is not a crumb to be seen, and the food stains on the seats are almost gone.  Really nice work.  It wasn't cheap, but if you want a good job, you need to pay for it.    These guys made it worth the money and we will certainly use them again if the need arises.  Three criticisms (hence the missing star):  1. There was still some smudge on the windows.  I don't expect perfection in anything, but there was a LOT of smudge and smear over the inside of the windshield that was not visible until you actually got behind the wheel and drove.  Some remnants of cleaner were also visible--maybe they rushed?  2.  They killed by battery.  No big deal--they jumped it and everything is okay, but this did take extra time.  3.  Guys, if you want to take a smoke break, be my guest.  Just don't drop your butts on my driveway.  Without these, five stars.

Hippy hippy joy joy!  The two hippies made me happy. How?  In the midst of moving my wife from Phoenix to San Francisco and packing up boxes and boxes of stuff, she took me here for lunch.  I had a chili dog that was hot, messy, and awesomely tasty.  The toasted bun was an added plus.  Along with that was a bag of the greasiest, yummiest fries in the world.  Were they soggy?  Well, yeah, but that's one of the things that made them so good.  This is one of those rare places where you wish your stomach was twice as big so you could just keep eating.  There was no soda machine or fountain, but these guys had the class to offer RC and Shasta sodas from their refrigerator, and that taste just topped off an already fantastic meal with something more.  Oh, and by the way, the whole shebang was $5!  There ain't much to this place, there are padded stools, a bar to eat on, lots and lots of hippy decor, and a kitchen that's always sending out smoke and delicious smells.  This place is ultra yum.  Forget about the fast food places--Two Hippies pwns them all.  Better food, more of it, and cheaper too.  Stop thinking about it--turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream.  It is believing.

As far as gas stations go, this one is turning into one of my favorites.  I haven't tried the car wash, but the service here is really friendly and the gas prices are lower than other places around (especially if you pay cash).  It's also near the 101 at Baseline, so it's convenient on top of everything else if you need to gas up and go.

Nice.  We hadn't done a sushi place in a while, so when my wife and I were out, and the question came up as to where we were going to eat that night, the fact that there was a sushi place right where we were at the time essentially answered the question for us.  But how was the food?  Quite good!  I'm not much of a sushi kind of guy, but I'm all for a good beef teriyaki on a bed of rice--thankfully, that's what they have here.  As for my wife, she's a lot more into raw fish, and Hon Machi did a tasty job there too.  Not too expensive, not too fancy, just good Japanese cuisine in a friendly atmosphere.  I can't let that much time go by between eating Japanese food again.  Now, I know a good spot to go to. . .

Want coffee, an energy drink, or even an Italian soda?  You can get the best here.  A lot of people know this, which is why the lines are so long.  It's more worth spending 10-15 minutes in line here than it is spending 5 minutes in line at any other coffee place.  And this location is open 24 hours--even more worth it.

Yelp just reminded me about this place saying, "You have a draft."  Well, it's a draft no longer.  One reason that many pet stores suck in the small animal department is that they don't always sex their little guys properly.  We learned this first hand when we discovered that the second guinea pig sow we bought was actually a boar, and our sow was pregnant.  Due to a lack of hormone production, our little girl had neither milk nor maternal instinct, and we lost all four pups.  Knowing that birth was very risky for guinea pigs, we found the Arizona Exotic Animal Hospital that very day (Saturday), and rushed her over as well as her lost litter.  This is not a vet for dogs and cats.  These folks handle exclusively exotics like rodents, lizards, birds, fish, and I was told that they even had coral as a patient once.  We knew right away that our little Cocoa was in good hands with Dr. Johnson.  She was still bleeding and was listless and underweight.  He prescribed an antibiotic as a guard against infection as well as a good aftercare regimen.  As for the lost pups, they know someone who will, free of charge, cremate all animal remains in a dignified manner.  I think this is wonderful--at least you know that your beloved lost pet won't end up in a scrap bucket or used for dissections somewhere.  These folks really do care.  They even called us back after a couple of days to make sure that Cocoa was doing all right.  About a week and a half later, we found that our girl was not eating at all anymore and was starting to lose a dangerous amount of weight.  Back to Dr. Johnson.  Judging from what he saw, he then prescribed a probiotic to help her gut get going again.  Now, less than a week later, her appetite is improving, and she is eating her veggies once more.  Two great experiences with the Arizona Exotic Animal Hospital earns five great stars from us.  Our girl is on the mend and we are very happy.  There are a lot of great vets in the Valley, but for small animal care, accept no substitutes.  If you need care for your exotic, you need professionals that have the experience and specialization that they do.  Look no further.

I have loved Waffle House since my college days in New Mexico.  Back then, a road trip to Albuquerque always included a  journey there for an all you can eat special for $3.99.  Prices have gone up just a bit since 1990, but Waffle House is still awesome.  It's still the quintessential American diner.  The varied menu covers all times of day, and the food is delicious all around.  You can get a nice, BIG breakfast here for $7.60 and a ribeye steak meal for $11.55.  How can you beat that for the price?  The tag line here is "Good food fast and friendly", and that's exactly what you get.  I'm often in the mood for something simple, quick, and cheap and Waffle House delivers every time.  Why don't I come here more often?

I only reviewed this place on June 3rd--why do such a negative update?  In a word, service--or lack thereof.  Our bad experience started with a waitress named "Dulce" or "Dulcie" or something like that.  She and another male employee were all that were running the place that night.  We sat down, and she, without any kind of "pardon" or "excuse me", starts pushing my cell phone and our hands and menus out of her way on the table so she can put down the utensils.  Quite rude, and not the end of it.  The male employee was somewhat nicer, but he and her began to engage in a kind of fake belligerence in front of customers--yelling at each other from across the restaurant and using profanity.  Not pleasant at all.  Our food was okay, but showed some degree of not caring--my daughter's chocolate chip waffle didn't have the chips mixed in.  They were thrown on and then burnt on the griddle.  I have been to this location a number of times and this is my first bad experience--unfortunately, it was a lulu.  Hopefully it won't be repeated or I will be going elsewhere for my waffles from here on.

Why haven't more people reviewed this place?  My wife and I were in Vegas this weekend and found that we could book mani-pedis for the two of us here at 10:15 pm.  The techs were friendly and professional.  I had a mani-pedi combo and my wife had a pedi with a color change on her acrylics.  Her nails were just a little rough on the edges, but overall both of us walked out with a nice job on our tips and toes.  Go here if you are looking for great nail service while on your trip to Vegas.  You can literally get your nails done (from a simple manicure to acrylics and gel) 24 hours a day.  Search on Google for their myspace page if you want to learn more and see pics.  Highly recommended.

On our trip to Phoenix, my daughter wanted to go rock climbing.  After researching, we headed over to Peoria and went Ape.  Apart from the facilities, which were great, I really noted how helpful the staff was here.  With their help and advice (and not to mention great instruction on how to belay) my wife and I were able to encourage our daughter to make it all the way to the top of the climbing face.  It was a great, fun experience for all of us.  Yes, we will be returning here on our next trip to Phoenix.  It's a great place for beginners to learn how to climb.

Katy Perry ought to do the commercial for this place:  U. S. Egg girls, they're just unstoppable, Daisy dukes and pancakes on top. . .  More about that in a minute.  First, I'll talk about the food.  This is the first restaurant we went to when my family first rolled into Phoenix.  While their famous "protein pancakes" weren't my taste, I'm a big fan of their regular pancakes and think that theirs are about some of the best I've had.  Fluffy and tasty, they really hit the spot.  And of course, the eggs.  At many places like IHOP or Denny's, you often get scrambled eggs cooked in this weird-tasting grease that leaves you with a burning sensation on your tongue.  At U.S. Egg, they're just tasty, and cooked in butter--delicious.  If you're looking for an opinion of their protein pancakes, just ask my wife.  She's really impressed by them and has ordered them on both occasions that we have visited.  Okay, on to the customer service.  Another reviewer said below that "legs sell eggs", and he's right.  This is where my "daisy dukes" comment comes in--the servers are all women, and many wear shorts and brightly colored cosmetics.  Beyond their appearance, they tend to be nothing special, and sometimes aren't even particularly nice.  Getting their attention can be challenging.  Nothing horrendous here, but significant enough to dock a star.  Too bad--this would easily be a five star place if they really focused less on legs and more on helpfulness.  If you are looking for a kick-ass breakfast, and don't mind some chilliness and a little bare skin from your server, U.S. Egg will do you right.  Sometimes there's a bit of a wait to get in--not surprising, and totally worth it!

As many of you know, when it comes to finding a chiropractor, you need to find the one whose approach fits what you are looking for in a treatment style.  When I left the Bay Area, I also left behind Dr. Colgin, who did a fantastic job treating me and my family.  Here in Tempe, I needed to find someone who could help us in the way that was right for us.  Thankfully, it actually didn't take me long to find Dr. Bennett.  Both me and my wife have visited Bobbie Bennett so far and are very pleased not only with her overall effectiveness in terms of pain relief, but also her personal, friendly approach.  When my wife's arm locked up, Dr. Bennett was able to bring back a good portion of her range of motion back in just a few visits.  For us, she's a keeper.  We're not the only ones who think this way--just look at the other reviews she has.  Both my wife and I enthusiastically recommend BodyWise Chiropractic to you for all of your back care needs.

Okay, Vine.   This is place is a pub and serves pub food--there's a problem here:  As I am a vegetarian and I ordered the Gardenburger, it's not really all that fair of me to review a place like this based on what I ate.  If the Gardenburger sucked, it really wouldn't be the fault of the restaurant.  To review a joint like this, you really have to try their meat dishes (most of the menu) and/or their beer.  Since I neither eat meat nor drink alcohol, I can't do that.  The Gardenburger turned out to be better than the one I've had at a lot of places, so at least there's that for what it's worth.  So what's left?  Well, the fried zucchini was quite good.  Service was excellent and friendly.  This has apparently been a favorite family restaurant for many years and still holds this distinction.  Minuses?  Well, it's noisy, but with all the kids and ASU students present on a Saturday night, that's no surprise.  The plates they give you to hold the food are surprisingly small, but that's about the worst thing I can say about this place.  Overall, I had a very enjoyable time here.  Next time, I'll have another veggie Jo burger with fries, a Diet Coke, maybe an appetizer, and just chill.  Fair review or not, I recommend Vine Tavern & Eatery.  I think you would too.

Superior taste.  This was one of those occasions when we didn't plan to eat Thai--it just kind of happened.  My wife had to go to the Fedex nearby to get in a copy job for work.  It was in the evening, we were all hungry, and food was on the agenda after Fedex.  I spot Thai Rama on the other side of the parking lot, and the question on what we were going to have for dinner was answered.  Often, Thai fried rices contain very dry meats.  I have always found it sad that you have all these tasty rices and veggies and then the meat sucks the saliva out of your mouth while you are trying to enjoy your meal.  At Thai Rama, the pork in my fried rice was substantially moister. more flavorful, and quite enjoyable.  It was a nice change.  My wife also experienced the better meat quality in her dinner.  The massaman beef she ate had large chunks of meat instead of the usual strips.  She said that they tasted like roast, and were so tender, you could cut the pieces with a fork..  We all left the restaurant with smiles on our faces.  Michelle L. said in a previous review this year that this spot is her "go-to Thai".  That's our label now for Thai Rama.  There's LOTS of good Thai out there, but why have good when you can have great?

I have not been on Yelp in forever due to the purchase and renovation of my new house.  In the transition time between my old apartment and there, this Lowe's has almost been a third home for me.  It only makes sense that I make my first comeback review for here.  This Lowe's location is where we made the majority of purchases for our home improvements.  From muriatic acid to a dishwasher to cabinet handles, we got the bulk of it here.  Both my wife and I want to give a BIG shout out to Rick who gave us all kinds of support and advice before and during our renovation.  The manager was also very supportive in helping us move money in and out of our credit account so that we could get the 5% off on all of our purchases.  One of our purchases was so big that we essentially got a microwave oven for FREE with the 5% off credit deal.  Just great.  Why only four stars?  In a word, Kevin.  We made an appointment with Lowe's some weeks ago to have a sliding door installed into the house.  We were under the impression that a man named Jesus was coming by to have a look at everything and give us an estimate.  Instead, this guy Kevin comes by.  When I mentioned to him that I was letting my wife decide on the style of the door, he commented to me that he learned three things to say in his long term of marriage: "Yes dear", "That looks nice dear", and "You're right dear."  Uh, OK.  Later, when I mentioned to him that she was in charge of the house decor (because she cares about it far more than I do), Kevin responded, "Yeah, I got the outs on how long you are going to be married."  WTF?  And now for the double WTF:  After his big sales song and dance, Kevin sets up the order, or so we think, and here it is a month later and still no door--apparently never put into the system.  He insults me, my wife and our marriage, and then charges us over a grand for no service.  We are going to get this straightened out with Lowe's ASAP.  We love this Lowe's location overall and we think that you will like it too, but STAY AWAY FROM KEVIN!

Now THIS is what I call a hotel.  Keep in mind, this is a hotel ONLY, with no casino, but there are plenty of casinos nearby if that's what you want.  We paid a little extra here, but we were going for comfort.  No, not beds or chairs, but allergen and irritant comfort--the Vdara is a non-smoking hotel.  Both my wife and I are so sensitive to smells and odors in hotel rooms that we have had to leave them in the middle of the night in the past and go elsewhere.  For our money, the Vdara delivered in spades.  Not only was there absolutely no smoke smell in the least, we could not detect any cleaning chemicals or disinfectants at all.  The only scents in the room were slight, clean, and non-irritating.  This was a relief.  A number of times before, at places like Motel 6 or Embassy Suites, we have had to deal with allergic reactions, swollen eyes, sore nasal passages, and sleepless nights from cheap hotel room odors.  Others may be able to take that stuff.  We can't.  We are always willing to pay a little more to ensure that we can get a peaceful and restful night's sleep, and we know now that the Vdara can give it to us.  Again: No smoke smell, No disinfectant smell, No chemical odors, --just a fresh, clean room.  That should help people doing a Yelp search to definitely find this place.  Even if every casino you visit in Las Vegas smells like smoke, you can come here and know that your hotel room never will!

I don't often review McD, but after my experience with their drive-thru, I needed to say something.  I went here during afternoon rush hour on the way home from work.  Not only did I get a regular Dr. Pepper instead of the Diet Coke I ordered, but I realized why the drive thru was going so slow:  The exit line spills out onto southbound 7th Street as it crosses Van Buren.  During rush hour, this is a disaster.  So much traffic comes down 7th Street that you could find yourself waiting to exit the lot for five minutes or more--per car.  It might not take that much time for you, but it's the luck of the draw.  This is a more or less typical McD, situated in a lousy spot traffic-wise.  I'm not lovin' it.  Even if you get what you order, you'll have to wait forever to get it.  Nothing's fast about the food around 4:30 or 5:00pm if you're hoping to eat on the road.  Better to park, eat inside, and wait for the torrent of cars to die down a bit before heading home.

They deliver, so we got delivery.  We found this joint via the Eat24 website.  It wasn't a cheap meal, but it was pretty good.  Due to allergies, we specified in the order "no onions" for many of the dishes, and this condition was granted with no issue.  Good curries and fried rices to be found here.  Both my wife and daughter liked the chicken satay and the Thai iced tea.  The order came to our door in about an hour, nice and hot.  The best Thai we've had?  No, but this place is one that we'll keep in mind for delivery in the future if we are exhausted and neither want to cook nor go out.

Nice.  Smeeks is one of those places where kids go to because they like the candy, and it's a place that adult go to so they can see candy they've haven't seen in a store in 30 years.  There's lots of old-fashioned and new-fangled sweets in here, along with a few toys tossed in.  The colors in here are bright and attractive, and there's so much to look through that it will be difficult to leave here without dropping $20+.  The only weird thing here is parking.  You need to maneuver around the back parking lot where the entrance is in order to get into the place--not very intuitive, but once you get there, the extra effort is worth it.  Smeeks rocks--if you're visiting Phoenix from out of town, don't pass up an opportunity to visit this place.  While you're here, check out Red Hot Robot next door too.    If you actually live in the Valley and haven't gone to Smeeks yet, I highly recommend that you at least try this place once--just don't tell your kids about it or they'll be trying to drag you over there every week.

Yeah.  I'm actually not a coffee drinker, but my wife and daughter are, so I started making trips here for them.  It's because of those visits that I found out about their "Rebel" or custom energy drink.  Now when people ask me, "What's your poison?", I say "Sugar-free strawberry Rebel."  If you're a Dutch Bros fan, you will understand.  The lines can sometimes be really long, but everything is usually so efficient that they move fast.  The workers are friendly and are so peppy and happy that I swear they take coffee in an IV drip.  One taste and you'll know why no other coffee place can compare to Dutch.    After ten stamps on your stamp card, you get one free--can't beat that.  If you love Dutch Bros as much as my family does, you know that it doesn't take long for that card to fill up!  Yes, drink one for Dane. . .maybe two.

What do you do when your wife takes your car key chain to work with her?  1. Get mad 2. Worry 3. Call Clean Air Cab  The answer is 3.  This is a real story by the way. . .  My cab was at my house about 20 minutes after I called.  Friendly, fast service--got my daughter to school and me to work with a few minutes to spare.  Price very good, and you get to ride in a hybrid vehicle to boot.  The inside of the cab smelled like a cheap hotel, but that was really the only negative I experienced.  Really friendly service from start to finish, and the price was right.  Need to call a taxi?  Call these guys--they did me right.

My wife and I just arrived here in the Valley about a month ago and she wanted to go dancing at place that plays New Wave, 80s, indie, etc.--it's her preferred music to dance to.  Off to the Internet to hunt for a spot that features this on a Saturday night.  Okay, here's a place called Sanctum.  We were amused by the reviews, and we had to see this one for ourselves.  The moment I walked in, I was impressed by the work that went into the decor of the place.  Thousands of dollars went into the "Gothic cathedral" look that seems to cover every inch of the place.  Some have characterized the artwork for this club as being "satanic".  Maybe it would appear to be so to the uninitiated (and I use that term deliberately).  However, the symbolism and iconography of some of the club's decor is immediately recognizable to those who have an awareness of a certain body of mystical knowledge.  It's obvious that the person who designed this place didn't just pick a lot of random stuff--he knew what he was doing.  Cover charge was $5.  As someone from the San Francisco area where $10 (and up) covers are common at clubs, I found this to be pretty darn cheap.  Saturday nights feature "Retro and Beyond".  The music had a really good spread, and I heard my wife repeatedly remark about she hadn't heard some of the songs they were playing in a very long time.  Sound system kicked ass, and the DJ didn't allow a second of dead air.  The floor area was drenched in lasers, lights, and fog.  The club as a whole was well-maintained and clean as a whistle.  I've been to a number of scuzzy-looking clubs and this one stands apart from the rest in cleanliness--despite the eeeeeeevil look of the place, the maintenance and quality you get give Sanctum a touch of class.  We didn't drink any alcohol, but my wife's water was $3.  Pretty standard--all clubs have pricey drinks.  Sanctum is probably the coolest club I've ever been to and we will be coming back regularly in the future.  In the mood for something "alternative"?  You'll find it here.  Now, get your butt over to this place and shake it on the dance floor.

I was lookin' for a bottle of Rosa Regale tonight to ring in the new year.  This rose-infused banfi isn't the most common sparkling wine, and Trader Joe's only has it sometimes, so I wanted to make sure that I went to a place that certainly had it in stock.  Did I find it?  Yup, I got the last one actually.  The selection is enormous, and if I had an extra hour or two, I would have gone through the store with a fine-toothed comb to familiarize myself with what they have.  DEFINITELY bigger than BevMo, and lots of help on the floor when (not if) you need help finding that Merlot or Lager amidst hundreds of others.  I'm not a big drinker, but if I need something containing ethanol, I know that it's likely I'll find it here or they'll try to find it for me.

This review is for the pharmacy in the store.  I had a tooth extracted recently and along with my antibiotics was a prescription for Vicodin.  I was not aware that you can now get a DUI for driving under the influence of Vicodin, but the head pharmacist let me know about this.  I probably would not have driven, but this was good to know just in case.  I could only imagine the hell that I would have gone through if I were stopped and cited.  Thank you so much.   This is your everyday WalMart, but the pharmacist in charge was top class.  Along with great prices, you also get great advice.  Recommended.

Tasty Italian.  Yes, there's definitely the feel of the chain Italian place that it is, but if you're in the neighborhood and you're in the mood for pasta, this place will satisfy your craving for noodles and sauce.  I had the Pasta Bolognese, and my wife had the Chicken Lemone.  Delicious all around.  Top that off with bread (perfect for dipping in balsamic vinegar or leftover sauce), and you have a satisfying meal.  Service was friendly too and the ambiance was pleasant.  I'm always in the mood for good priced pasta, and Babbo gave me what I was looking for.  If you've seen their billboards and was wondering what they were like, I can vouch for their good taste on multiple levels.

Many thanks to Bradley at Ron's Service and Tire Center.  We were driving down the road and heard an odd sound that seemed to be coming from the right front tire.  Upon inspection, we found a 3/8 inch bolt imbedded in the tread.  Shit.  Time to pull up Yelp on the iPhone--Ron's tire place came up.  One call, one visit, one FREE tire repair, and we are on our way.  Ron's SERVICE is top quality.  Highly recommended.

Haven't written a review in a while.  Now's the time.  I saw Lobby's from the road for a while as we were going from here to there.  I saw the sign and thought, "Hmmm, burgers,"  The GeoQpons coupon from my iPhone was my incentive to take my family over for lunch.  Cool ambiance here.    The first thing that I caught my eye about Lobby's is the service.  Everybody was friendly and attentive, and we even got a big mound of extra crinkle fries with our burgers--I'm not kidding, the guy just scooped a whole bunch of extra fries on our tray.  There ain't nuthin' fancy about these burgers, and that's what makes 'em special.  Simple, fresh, grilled meat, topped any way you like (and believe me, these things can get topped REALLY high).  Fries were simple and tasty.  We left full and happy.  Next time, I might try me a dog or an Italian sandwich--we'll see.  This place rocks.

Sometimes, Yelp is right on.  I was looking for a great Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood to take my wife to (it was date night).  This place had far more stars than most, so we gave it a go.  Upon entering (we visited on First Friday last month) it was so loud that it was like bombs going off.  The decor was unusual and had an interesting botanica vibe going on.  Service was a bit slow but they were so packed that I wasn't surprised.  Their salsa bar had more flavors than I've ever seen at a restaurant anywhere--and I've been to a lot of Mexican Restaurants.  As for the food itself, there was nothing "traditional" about it, but everything was so bursting with incredible flavor that I was savoring every bite.  Holy sh*t, that was good.  My burrito was loaded with CHUNKS of marinated steak--not ground, not shredded, but chunks.  I was blown away.  Next time, there's a SHARK burrito on the menu that I can't wait to taste.  If you're in the mood for something "traditional", I still point people to Mi Patio in Phoenix.  However, if you're looking for something other than the same old Mexican taste, may I recommend this landmark.  It's just a few blocks north of McDowell on your right hand side.  You won't regret it.  The place is small and can sometimes be packed with noisy gringos, but the taste is unforgettable.

Maybe 3 1/2 stars is more accurate, but I DID enjoy the food here.  It's a diner, with an extensive Coca-Cola theme throughout the whole place.  Good diner food--the breakfast I had here was tasty and filling.  I'm looking forward to trying one of their hotdogs here sometime.  A few criticisms:  One, PLEASE clean your grill.  My wife was trying to enjoy her breakfast of corned beef hash and eggs, and she kept tasting what seemed to her to be liver and onions.  I could also taste something residual on the food myself, although it wasn't as bothersome to me.  It was noticeable though.  Two, more important, what is up with your bathroom situation?  I understand that your bathrooms are "outside, to the left", but your description of "clean" isn't super accurate.  First, you have to walk around jumbled boxes and trash outside to even get to the doors.  Then, the interior is a bit. . .dingy.  It wasn't the worst bathroom I've seen by a long shot, but little black bits of ??? on the floor and a strong urine smell did not give me a lot of confidence about the cleanliness of the place.  I really don't want to be too harsh here--service was great, food was great, ambiance was entertaining, but that bathroom. . .  I think I'm still getting flashbacks to that pizza place in California where people were using the soap dispenser as an ashtray.  This place wasn't as bad, but there's room for improvement.  Overall, I'm a fan. . .of the FRONT of the restaurant, not the back.

You know about all those billboards that say, "Mattress Stores are Greedy"?  Well, they didn't come from this place, and there's even one at the time of this writing across the street from the showroom.    Is Sleep EZ greedy?  No, don't think so, but they will sell you a great mattress at a decent price.  My wife and I did a lot of studying and shopping around before coming here, and we found that the type of mattress that most suited us is the latex type--all organic.  Since my wife has a severe allergen problem (and I get it from time to time as well), we needed an all natural mattress like this that wouldn't break the bank.  Sleep EZ has it.  Go there, lay down, try it out, maybe get a fancy motorized platform with massage. . .  I'm not waking up sore anymore, and I have Sleep EZ to thank for it.  I also noted in my research that latex mattresses like the ones they sell here are the best ones for sex, and that only makes things better.  So, whether you want to hit the hay or take a romp in it, this place will have what you're looking for.  Maybe some mattress stores ARE greedy, but not this one.  Give it a shot.

Went here for 5W50 motor oil as a friend suggested that this would be a good choice for my vehicle.  We looked at every specialty oil shop we could find in the Valley, and no 5W50 anywhere.  Who had it?  Autozone, and the one in Buckeye to boot (near where we were staying at the time).  Then, I just took the van over to WalMart practically down the street and had the oil changed.  Thanks guys for having what I wanted, when I wanted, when everybody else didn't.

Heard of Whataburger?  Welcome to Whataripoff.  I guess I was clueless--my wife knew that their prices were inflated but I didn't.    Granted, they have a hell of a selection of stuff, but when I saw that their prices for electric razors was about $20 more for the exact same one you can find on the shelf at Target, it turned me off.  Target may not be as fancy, and you may not get the selection, but if you want a toaster, an iPod speaker, or whatever, you will get it for significantly less elsewhere.  Even the "clearance" items were more expensive or as expensive as shelf prices at Target or WalMart.    An example?  A clock consisting of a thin wood frame, a fake plastic picture canvas, and a $7 AA-battery quartz movement goes for $70 here, and $30 on clearance.  Are you kidding me?  No.  Come here if you get a gift card--but I assure you it won't go far. . .

Your standard gas and mart.  Very clean!  As some of you may know, the road from Phoenix to Las Vegas is fairly devoid of services for much of its length.  So, while driving in the dead of night, spots like these are oases.  Drinks, chips, gas, and bathroom, all with friendly service.  Thanks!

When you're sick and need help NOW, and the general practitioners that you call can't see you for TWO WEEKS, where do you go?  To the urgent care clinic.  East Valley Urgent Care is the closest one to me.  Now, when you go to a facility that offers walk-in service, you may find a waiting room that's nearly empty, or an absolute full house.  I've seen both.  Frankly, I didn't care--I'd rather be able to wait a few hours to get care today than at an appointment in two weeks.  The kids crying can get a little irritating, but the facility is neat and clean.  Service is good once you get a room.  They accept insurance and at all of the times that I have been there, members of my family have received excellent care.  I almost wonder if I really need a general practitioner at all at this point.  If this is the one place that can guarantee me care when I need it without having to go to the ER, maybe I'll just stick with these guys.

What assholes.  We considered these folks for a vacation back in 2013, but decided against it because we just didn't have the cash at the time to pay for it.  Fast forward to today.  I get a call from them out of the blue.  First a woman reading off of a script tries to fast talk me into getting a vacation from them, and then a guy gets on the line and tries to get one of my email addresses and lock me in on paying for a vacation in advance.  When I told him that I needed to arrange any vacations with my wife first, he pointed out their "money-back guarantee".  He wouldn't shut up, and I couldn't get a word in edgewise.  Furthermore, he was in a room filled with other telemarketers, so I could not even hear him very well.  Finally, I told him that no money was going to go out today, but I would call them if I wanted a vacation.  I then heard, "Then you're going to pay full price." ***click***  He hangs up.  Great way to get business.  No, if I was considering it before, I now will NEVER go to Diamond Resorts for a vacation.  I then blocked their number and decided to fry their ass here on Yelp.  Mission accomplished.  UPDATE: 7/20/16:  Ever since this initial call, I have been besieged by phone calls from this company, at least one per day.  The phone calls have originated from Toms River, NJ, Vienna, VA, St. Petersburg, FL, Baltimore, MD, Lewisburg, PA, and New Castle, DE.  Every time it's a new place, and every time I block the number.  I wonder how many they have. . .

We only know this place by ordering from them at Grubhub.  We've been to a lot of Thai spots out here and I have consistently been disappointed by the fried rices.  Dry meat!  I'm so tired of dry chicken and dry pork whenever I order Thai fried rice at Thai joints. I expected the same here when I ordered and got a big cup of soda ready to chase it. . .  But no-- I was surprised by the juicy meat here.  Yummy, tasty fried rice, and an enjoyable experience with curries for the rest of my family too.  Intriguing.  I hope we can repeat this experience in the near future.

First review of 2014.  Real Southern Italian cuisine is to be found here in spades.  While it seems to have something of the retro vibe that Oregano's has, this place is not a chain, and the ambiance here is more of an Italian home during the 40s and 50s instead of a restaurant with random antiques hung on the walls, ceiling, etc.  Not only does it look like an Italian-American home during that time, it tastes and smells like it too.  The recipe for the sauce no doubt has roots in the old country, and I'm certain someone's Nonna came over from Palermo a century ago with that recipe in her head.  The meat sauce has a sweet, spicy taste.  Fantastic, but as my family is Zeneize and Toscano, it's a distinctly different flavor from what I am used to.  My wife and I were very happy with our meal, but I have to be in the mood for food from the lower half of the Boot to want to come here again.  When that moment strikes, I'll be ready to return for some lasagne or a pizza.  Thanks RigaTony's for a delicious lunch!

Wandering Horse isn't the cheapest buffet around, but OMG what a buffet it is.  I can sum it up in all up in five words:  All you can eat steak.  And not crappy shoe leather steak--delicious mini kobe or other steaks, as much as you want, pile it high.  And you can do the same with the chicken, the fish and shrimp, the pork and crab legs, the Mexican food, the Asian food, salad, veggies, and tons of different kinds of desserts but. . .  The steak--endless steak, tasty, tender steak, eat until you pop steak.  Just go back and get more  Walk into the casino, head in, pay once. and let the beef commence.

Ross?  No, not for the clothes--the kitchen supplies!  That stuff that didn't sell at other places sells here for cheaper.  You never know what you are going to find, but I espied a set of Cuisenart kitchen knives (over a dozen pieces including steak knives) here for $40.  Torani syrups (various flavors) for $7 each retail!  You can always find an endless array of pans, pots, choppers, cookers and holders for substantially less than what you would find them at other stores.  Sometimes you really hit the jackpot here, and sometimes you don't, but you can outfit your entire kitchen here for cheap if you don't mind mixing and matching.

Wow, nice buffet!  Where can you get tender, properly seasoned, all you can eat steak for $21 per person?  Talking Stick.  Yes, it's a casino and all, but if you go to the buffet, you're not taking chances--you're guaranteed a good meal.  I got a mound of perfect little steaks, fried calamari, pork rolls, chicken chow mein, steak fries, and 4 chocolate chip cookies.  I was stuffed.  My wife was equally pleased.  If you want to gamble out on the smoky floors, go ahead.  I put $70 into the machines and walked away with about half that.  From this point, I'm coming here mainly for the food.  Many restaurants will charge you this much for food inferior to this.  At Talking Stick, you get great quality, great tasting grub that seems to have been made with care.  Absolutely recommended dining.  Great place for a dinner date with the spouse.  Next time, we're bringing our daughter. . .

$9, all you can eat.  No, that's not just the lunch special, that's the buffet price all day long.  We're talking fantastic, authentic Indian food here.  Great variety of taste, lots of vegetarian options, tasty naan, and friendly service top off the experience at India Oven.  Nothing more to say--a long, detailed review isn't necessary here. Just try it for yourself and enjoy!

Unsatisfied.  First off, I'm really sick and tired of going to this place and them not having half the stuff we want.  Cinnamon donuts?  No, we don't have any.  We have cinnamon crumb.  Ham croissant?  Sorry, we're out.  Small boba drink?  NO!  We only have medium.  Uh. . .  A stinky 'tude from someone behind the counter can really ruin a place for me.  Last night, the lady at Bosa gave us a perfect example of "a stinky 'tude."  Did my Diet Coke really take five minutes to pour?  Did you really need two reminders to give it to me?  WTF was your problem lady?  The donuts here are good, but I'm now trying to decide if it is all worth the frustration. . .stay tuned.

This is a pretty sucky McDonald's.  It was nice to have a McDonald's so close to where I live, but in the time I have been living here, I have experienced at this place:  --LOOOOONG drive-thru lines that can take 20 minutes or more.  --egg shell pieces in the McMuffins  --double charges on my debit card  The food actually tastes just a bit better than other McDs I've been to, but the issues listed often make it not really worth it.  If it takes you 20 freaking minutes to get your food, it ain't fast--kind of defeats the purpose.  This place is just a facepalm overall and I really can't recommend it.  Maybe you'll be lucky--we haven't been.

I guess we don't f***ing learn.  My wife went here this morning to take advantage of their 2 sausage biscuit with egg McMuffin deal for $3.33.  She ordered 2 of them for $6.66 and it turned out to be a devil's deal.  They charged her for 4 McMuffins and gave her only TWO.  This isn't the first time I've been shorted a McMuffin here, but it is the first time I came TWO SHORT and I'm getting pretty cheesed off.  They always give replacements when you go back and speak to the manager, but how about not having this garbage happen in the first place?  Down to one star.

Nice service!  Ryan Linder is the RN who runs this spot.  I went for a vaccination here and I was very pleased with the speed and friendliness of the service.  Somewhere between the local urgent care clinic and getting a flu shot at Walgreens, you'll find this place.  If all you need is some minor medical service, try them first.  They're right inside of the Fry's.  Do some shopping and stop by.

When my wife's back started to really hurt at three o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, I despaired.  This wasn't a good time for one's back to go out because, as I learned in the past, no chiropractors are open!  . . .at least that's what I thought. . .  A few places make a pretense of being open "by request" but when I emailed one, I didn't get a call back.  A look on Yelp did reveal The Joint as being open on a Sunday--since we were at a loss to try anything else that day, we decided to give it a try.  Turns out that The Joint is owned by the same people that own Massage Envy, and they have a similar concept--if you're a member, you can go to any Joint at any time for service as per the rules of your plan.  Nice!  My wife joined, and she got the relief that she was looking for.  A few follow-up appointments later, and the pain was gone.  Keep in mind--this is stripped-down chiro service.  There's no x-rays or initial consultations, no water jet beds or IR lasers.  If you're looking for just straight up chiropractic with no commitments, this may be the Joint you're looking for.  Have a look at the reviews.  They speak for themselves.  N.B. Not all Joints are open on Sundays, but this one is.  :)

It's all about the falafel.  Try the special--falafel in a pita with veggies and fries.  Fast food fries with a tasty falafel pita is the vegetarian alternative to a McDonalds combo menu--much better for you and more delicious.  Like meat?  The falafel here offers a great-tasting substitute and you won't feel like you're eating rabbit food.  Don't like meat? The falafel is great, and so are the salads, soups, and everything else.   A place that has veggie food as good as this is hard to find.  Skip spots like "Green" and all their doctored up Morning Star Farms fake meat and come have a taste of something delicious and unique here at Tsom.

I usually prefer more "plain" kinds of restaurants and don't visit places like this too often.  This is a bar and grill of the fancier sort, with more specialized kinds of foods.  Usually, when I see "pastas" on a menu, I tend to think that they'll serve a few different kinds of noodles/gnocchi/stuffed pastas with a selection of sauces.  Here, you only get a few selections like three cheese mac and cheese, basil and chicken linguine, or shrimp scampi.  The menu's range is not broad, but they still offer an interesting selection.  For those a bit more cost-conscious, there is a "happy hour" menu where you can select things like wings, fish tacos, or chips with dip for only $5 at a certain time during the early evening.  There are also deals to be found elsewhere, and one special being offered the night we were there was an 8 oz. steak with fries and veggies for only $9.  My wife and I both opted for this with a soda, and we ended up with a total bill under $25 with drinks and tax.  Nice, and the steak had a good flavor.  We left full and satisfied for fewer $$$ than most places would have asked for.  My wife and I liked Thirteen North, and will return again.  I've got my eyes on the fish and chips for the next time. . .

Wow.  After our aborted trip to Two Hippies one Sunday (it was closed), we looked around on Yelp for another spot for lunch.  Cambodian food caught my wife's curiosity, so we dodged the roadwork in the quest to make it here.  Decorated with antiques (some look like they were from 1950s Cambodia) this place was very pleasant inside.  Service was friendly and smiling.  The food was--quite unlike anything else I've ever had.  The fried rice had chunks of perfectly seasoned, tender beef that gave it. . .dimension (for the lack of a better word) that I never realized that a fried rice could have.  I know that this sounds kind of strange, or even goofy, but the taste was simply phenomenal.  When I spoke to my wife about her lemongrass soup, I realized that I she was having a similar experience with her food.  A previous reviewer referred to this restaurant as "one of the true ethnic gems of central Phoenix", and I can't put it any better.  If you're in the area and are thinking about Thai curry or a bowl of pho, may I suggest this alternative.  It's not the particular ethnicity that makes this place unique as much as its sheer outstanding quality.  It's something different, done deliciously.

A great new breakfast joint to add to our rotation!  Because of our daughter's classes in Scottsdale, we started to look for breakfast places in the area to check out.  Of all of the breakfast spots that we have been to, I will have to say that Butters is probably the best of them all.  We've tried U.S. and Good Egg, Eggington's and others, and a lot of them are really good, but for simple melt in your mouth breakfast without any pretense, Butters takes the prize.  You get a huge amount of food for your money, and everything tastes great!  From the first bite of the hash browns, I could tell that this place was different.  They were substantially less greasy than the other places we have visited.  When the potatoes taste good enough plain that you _don't_need_ to add any salt, that's saying a lot!  From the potatoes to the pancakes and the french toast to the sausage, Butters is just. . .better.  Service is friendly.  The only challenge is getting a seat because this place is so popular, so be prepared to wait on Sunday mornings.  It's worth waiting for.

Breakfast!  At many different places, you can find delicious french toast, huge, thick pancakes, and the requisite bacon, ham or eggs.  Every place worth their salt has something unique that you won't find anywhere else in the same way--it's the thing that puts them on the map foodwise.  Here, it's the different kinds of Eggs Benedict.  This place has two things going for it that makes it different from the other spots around:  1. It's not a chain--it's a family business.  The term "Mark's Cafe" means just that--he's an executive chef with well over 20 years in the biz.  He not only supports his family with this restaurant, but his daughter is also the waitress.  2. The staff is extremely friendly, and there isn't the distance that you often feel at other restaurants.  Plus, the food has a personal touch that you can taste in every bite.  So sure, if I am in the mood for T.C. Eggington's pancakes or French Toast, I'll go there--knowing that I'm also going to get a big, packed, noisy restaurant with Stepford waitresses.  If I want some of U.S. Egg's food, I'll go there and deal with the vibe that comes with them.  However, if I just want to relax, and have a quiet, tasty breakfast with my wife, then I'll come to Mark's.  It's a really tranquil place to go and and have a carefree bite to eat.  Mark is undoubtedly an Elton John fan--one of the t-shirts you can buy here has the writing, "B - B - B - Bene and the Chef!"  It's a reference to the Eggs Benedict dishes--usually has that song going through my head for hours after leaving.  If you don't get the joke, you're probably a bit younger than I am.  I recommend the biscuits and gravy--a bit spicier than some I've had--quite nice.  Marks' Cafe is just a nice place to experience.  If you haven't eaten there yet, they should go on your short list.  Looking to have brunch with the wife/hubby?  I got a great spot for ya here.

This place just impresses me more and more.  Remember that Roy Orbison song:  Anything you want, you got it. Anything you need, you got it. Anything at all, you got it.  Mark Vojtek is an executive chef who opened up a little breakfast place in Tempe.  His dishes are creative and delicious.  The main waitress (who is also Mark's daughter) says that she specialized in "making dreams come true"--that means that you can get your breakfast or lunch made to order, with any reasonable variation possible.  So, if you want to get a plate of veggies topped with sausage gravy, they'll be happy to cook it up and bring it to your table.  Really, it's no problem.  Service is friendly and generous.  The place is small, so be sure to get a seat early--it can fill up here fast!  The french toast is fantastic, the pancakes are trucker-style (gigantic), and their chocolate muffins are something that words are insufficient to describe.  Butter, just lots of butter and everything will be alright with the world--they're that good.  We love a lot of the breakfast spots around here, and Mark's was certainly on our rotation.  It's just that we have been rotating to Mark's more often as of late.  The taste and service won us over.  We think you'll agree.  The place is tucked into a corner of the strip mall where it is located, but you shouldn't have any trouble finding it with all of the cars crowded into that area of the parking lot.  It's a local, family-owned business that just happens to make some of the best food around.  If you haven't visited Mark's yet, I hope that I have now provided you with an excuse to check them out.

Okay, now we're talking.  I thought I had the pizza deal of the Valley when I discovered Jimmy & Joes, but then I found this place.  I don't know how to react other than to say _wow_.  Here's how it goes:  --A slice of cheese pizza is 99 cents (additional toppings are $0.25 each, custom made). --Two slices of cheese pizza and a can of soda is $2.75. --A WHOLE 18-inch pie is EIGHT DOLLARS PLUS TAX, with additional toppings for $1.25 each. --Calzones, $5 each. --A dozen garlic bread "knots" with marinara for $5.  And they deliver too.  Cash only.  No cards--this keeps prices down.  And just in case you're thinking, "Oh, for that price it must be shit pizza, right?"  No.  This is actually REALLY GOOD pizza with fresh ingredients and a delicious crust.  Forget the chains with their high overhead and corporate profit margins.  Here's your chance to support an independent local business that provides the community with a great product.  The owner is a really friendly, approachable guy that honestly wants to give people a good pizza at a good price--and he succeeds (thanks Jimmy!).  The next time you're tempted to go to a festering conglomerate to satisfy your pizza fix, remember that right here in your neighborhood is a cheaper, less glitzy alternative.  There's no beer, no salad bar, and no gluten-free option--just the stripped-down basics, and it rocks.  Go here.  Spread the word.  Even my daughter likes this place and she doesn't even like pizza!  99 Cent Pizza Place--give this man your business!

Yup!  Squarz.  Can't really believe that I never saw this place before tonight, but after ordering food there, I just needed to get on Yelp and rave about it.  The food really is mostly little "squarz" of flaky dough with filling.  The shepherd's pie was absolutely delicious.  The mac and cheese (in a cup) was a little more fancy than some I've had, with tiny onion bits and smoky flavor.  I finished off the meal with a tiny apple pie squar.  It was just enough and made a great meal even better.  We all loved our squarz and will definitely be ordering again or visiting in person soon.  Perfect for lunch and easy to eat!  Totally recommended--give it a try!

Joanna 23 specializes in facepainting, henna work and mehndi designs.  You will readily see her at the Firehouse gallery in Phoenix on First Fridays making intricate designs on ladies' hands.  I met her several years ago when she performed my wife's bridal mehndi for our wedding.  She did an absolutely kick-ass job with her artwork running all the way up my wife's arms.  More recently, she put a fancy henna peacock on my daughter's hand.  As you can see from the pictures, she is very talented and knows her stuff.  If you're looking for mehndi work anywhere in the Phoenix metro area, by all means, call her for an appointment.

Wanna swirl it?  This place has delicious frozen yogurt.  My daughter told us about it and we went over here one weekend for an after-lunch sweet.  Get your yogurt cup, go to the dispensers, and serve yourself.  You can get a single flavor, or swirl two together.  Then, you can top it off with candies, nuts, or even fruit before checkout.  My one caveat--they charge by weight, so fill your cups with caution.  Get it to go, sit on one of their chairs and eat in, or pull up to one of their iPad stations and have fun with your froyo.  Any way you do it, Swirl It is a winner.

First review of 2013.  Before going out to dinner one night, my wife was browsing in this store and I met her there.  Pretty amazing place.  Beyond me, there was not a trace of Y chromosome in the entire shop.  Amidst a few small rooms, you will find clothing, accessories, handmade knick-knacks, accessories, shoes, accessories, make-up, accessories, accessories, and accessories.  And did I mention accessories?  Lots of unique, fashion stuff here and a lot of stuff you never expected--even stuff you didn't know existed.  You might be tempted to bring your tween or teenage daughter here, but there is a distinctly ADULT room here too, so parental guidance is suggested.  One more plus is that the owner sells things on consignment, so if you make unique bling or interesting, wearable, girly. . .stuff. . . that nobody else makes, take it to her instead of selling it on Etsy.  If she likes it, you may have just found a place to sell it.  You've been to the corporate mall stores--now try Trampalina.  If you're looking for that one thing that will complete your look and you haven't found it yet, you may just find it here.

I really wanted to like Pizza 'N Greens.  I was just about ready to give them four stars but then. . .okay, let me tell you the whole story.  My wife and I walk in to this empty pizza place hoping for lunch before a movie.  We are greeted by a friendly gentleman ready to heap service upon us like nobody's business.  We ordered our food and drinks, everything seemed fine.  The pizza was very saucy, and actually pretty good.  As this restaurant appears to be halal, none of the meats have pork in them.  Thus, you get turkey sausage.  That was fine with me.  Halfway through our meal, some folks came in--not to eat, but to chat with the owner.  He then went into chat mode, at one point sitting down with his back to us, to chew the fat for an extended period.  Goodbye service.  He just stopped paying attention to us completely.  My message to the owner of Pizza 'N Greens:  When you own a business, and in particular, a restaurant business, the customer comes first.  Sitting down and chatting with your friends while you have customers in the store is not a good idea.  Even if you are going to do that, at least give your patrons the highest priority.  If I did what you did as a waiter for most restaurants, I would probably get fired.  Oh, yeah--also, when a customer flags you down and finally gets your attention, be sure that when you refill a customer's drink, you FILL IT ALL THE WAY.  A refill does not mean that you give back the cup two-thirds full.  How much money in soda syrup are you really saving?  As I said before, I really wanted to give these folks more stars, but the service turned me off.  I liked the pizza, and the price wasn't bad at all, but when the owner gives chit chat  with his buds a higher priority than a paying customer, it makes me think that I should be going elsewhere the next time I want a pie.

So far, I've just been here with the family for pool and soft drinks.  This isn't a seedy pool hall--this is a sports bar and grill with pool tables, a dart machine, and more.  While most of their income, no doubt, is from cocktails and beer at the bar, you also see people here having lunch and dinner, sometimes looking up at the tv to see the Cardinals or the Diamondbacks play.  I haven't had the food yet, but the place is friendly and with a good atmosphere, so I see a point sometime soon where I'll take the family there for a meal and another game of pool.  I'll be sure to scratch on the break like I often do, but at least we'll all be having fun.

We heard about Jason through a mutual friend.  Not only did we have leaking pipes out in front of our house, but one of the valves there was just about shut and sealed off water from an entire wing of our house.  Jason got right on it and repaired the broken valves we had quick.  He was great to work with and his prices were very fair.  He even gave us a one year warranty on parts and labor.  Before meeting Jason, I called another (apparently highly Yelp rated) plumber about the problem of the water not working in part of the house, and I kept getting advice from them about checking the screens on the faucets or whatever.  Jason didn't give me this BS--he just solved our problem.  Here's another small, local business that I can recommend to you, and I couldn't recommend it more highly.  Got a plumbing problem?  Call Jason.

Nice!  Cheap, fast, great pizza.  $5 will get you a one topping large, and $9 will snag an extra large.  For the price, you can't beat it.  They'll do pizza right, and deliver it to your door in less than an hour.  I would call this more of a delivery or pick-up place than anything else.  They have only a few tables, so I wouldn't recommend this as a sit down pizza joint unless things are slow--they fill up very quickly.  The floors and walls are concrete or brick, the table and chairs are spartan.  Never mind the furnishings or the decor.  It's all about the pizza here.  Service is great.

Okay, let's try this place out.  This is the live blow by blow--writing this review in the restaurant.  I have been waiting for months, driving past this place almost daily waiting for it to open.  It's finally open, so let's wait an hour in queue and get some Mexifood at the newest place in town.  Nice chips with pico--so far so good.  Chips a bit greasy, but tasty.  Ambiance here cool.  They put some money into this place.  Salt and pepper shakers are Coronita bottles--yup seen this before.  When I go to Mexican restaurants, I rarely drink beer, but this time, yes, I had a Dos Equis.  This, with the chips, was a nice start.  And now, the moment of truth.  I got three enchiladas with rice and beans.  My wife got the beef burro with fundido.  My daughter got a chile relleno plate.  Scratch the beans--they ran out.  LOL!  That's ok.  From the first bite--incredible.  You get a LOT of food here for your money and a high amount of quality goes with that quantity.  There used to be a place in the SF Bay Area called La Michoacana.  They had the best Mexican food ever--I'm not kidding.  When they closed, I was very sad to realize that I may never have Mexican Food of that kind of complexity again.  Well, I'm happy to say that La Fonda has it!  Many Mexican restaurants have good food, but overdo the cilantro or have some flavor out of balance.  Here, ALL tastes are in balance--it tastes as if it was made in Nana's kitchen.  Even my daughter said that it tastes like her Grandmother's cooking, except with more cheese.  That's high praise.  As it turns out, the recipes used at this place are actually from the owner's grandmother--that's why it's all so good.  We finished off the meal with flan and sopapillas--a perfect ending to a great meal.  I haven't been to every Mexican restaurant in the Valley (there are hundreds, maybe thousands), so I can't say that this is the best Mexican restaurant in the area.  However, I have been to quite a number of them, and this really is the best one I have been to so far. Service was absolutely stellar.  I said it before to the owner, and I will say it again here--DON'T CHANGE!  I want to come back again sometime soon, and sometime later, and I want this same kind of taste time after time.  I'm glad to have the first review up here so I can give you all a great first impression of this place on Yelp.  If you are looking for superb Mexican Food in the Tempe area, this is the spot to visit.  Say thirsty (and hungry) my friends.

It's a 24-hour diner.  Nothing super special, but if you're hungry, you'll get decent food and nice service.  I'll give it four stars because it is quite successful at what it is.  We will be back.

Finally, friendly folks who do the job right.  My wife decided after several years to have acrylic nails put back on.  Previous visits to other salons for manicures and pedicures found weird attitudes from techs, infections, and manicures that peel off in two days.  We wanted a place that would welcome us, provide good service, and have good prices.  It is amazingly hard to find all three of these qualities in a nail salon.  My wife used to do nails when she was younger, so she knows what she is looking for.  One thing that she noticed about this place was that when Tia was doing her nails, she planned carefully and put on just enough acrylic to finish the job with a minimal amount of grinding.  This way, she saved time, product, and money.  When the nails were complete, they were done so well that before the color went on they looked like her own natural nails at first glance.  This shows good skill on the tech's part.  The end result?  Just look at the photos that I posted here.  Nice shape, nice job overall.  If my wife is happy, then I'm happy.    You can currently find good coupons for Colorful Nails through Valpak.  If you have the GeoQPons app on your iPhone, you can also find printout coupons there.  Just one IMPORTANT thing.  This salon does NOT have a storefront on McClintock.  The salon on the street is called Leo Orchid and has terrible Yelp reviews overall (see for yourself).  Since they have the same address (being in the same complex), people tend to confuse the two (Leo Orchid apparently also honors Colorful Nails coupons, adding to the confusion).  The salon is near Xtreme Bean and used to be called ABC Nails.  From McClintock, turn on to Southern past the Walgreens and then make a left on Butte to turn into the back side of the parking lot.  Colorful Nails is in the long building there.  If you are looking for a nice set of nails, complete with freehand nail art, these folks will make you happy.  Tips by credit card OK.

A Tale of Two Pizzas in Scottsdale, Part I  After a night of clubbing in Scottsdale, my wife and I began searching for a place open late that serves pizza.  We really didn't want to eat in club central where the only way to park is by valet.  Out came the iPhone with the Yelp app, and out pops KISS.  It was open late and we could park in the parking lot.  I was a bit apprehensive at first, but we had friendly, accommodating service as soon as we walked in.  There was a cheese pizza all ready for us to eat upon entering--all we had to do was pay and have it served.  This was a fantastic pie with a slightly chunky sauce.  The cook puts a lot of love into the preparation of his food--and it shows.  This place is apparently ONLY open on Friday and Saturday, but I see how they stay in business.  Their food is so damned good, they obviously sell a LOT of it.  Both my wife and I really enjoyed our late-night dinner here and hope to return again some time soon.  We both heartily recommend KISS Back East Pizza and Beef Joint.

It's more than a bar.  This place boasts a hell of a sound system and a small but very nice dancing area.  My wife and I came here to attend the Pax Romana event by City of Madness (goth, industrial, etc.)  City of Madness used to hold events over at Sanctum, but after Sanctum's closing, they set up shop here and run a great show.  It ain't the largest place to dance in, but you'll have enough room to really shake it and get some great and friendly service while you're there.  Goth dance spots are a pretty limited field in the Valley, but if you're looking for one, be sure to check Club 24's calendar.  $5 to get in.

This is the only Sizz in the immediate vicinity.  I was telling my wife a few days ago that I hadn't been to a Sizzler in a few years and it was high time that we went to one in the Valley.  Today, we did.  Good steak, nice shrimp, not so good salad.  In a lot of ways, this Sizzler is kind of like getting Black Angus and Sweet Tomatoes rolled into one, only that it's a step down from Black Angus and two steps down from Sweet Tomatoes.  Overall though, we had a really nice meal.  The holiday sale of steak and lobster was really nice for my wife, and the "endless shrimp" with a steak filled me up nicely.  The salad just didn't do it for me--something about the taste was bland, but I don't go to the Sizz to graze on salad.  For me, it's all about the meat, the seafood, and the. . .  Cheese toast!  Yes, this old favorite of mine going back to the 1970s is still here, and still as good as ever.  You don't get the old fashioned plates with the wood underplate and the metal main plate any more, but you still get the same reliable Sizzler steak taste at a reasonable price.  Yes, there are better places to get a slab of meat, but Sizzler will always hold a special place in my heart for a decent steak and fixins with the family.  We'll be back.

When you are dealing with the complicated task of appraising jewelry from your parents' house for purposes of settling an estate, two things are essential:  1.  Get multiple opinions--sometimes one source knows more than another on certain types of items,  and  2.  Find jewelry places that are trustworthy, with experts who know their stuff and will happily give you the very best and friendliest service.  If you live in the East Valley, PV Coin and Jewelry is an excellent choice for one of those places.  We brought the jewelry in and we got a figure for each and every piece of value, listed one by one.  They even cleaned my mother's wedding ring and rated the center stone.  I and my family were made to feel like welcomed guests by Jonah and Mariah and we very much appreciated the care that they put into the appraisals.  Special thanks also goes to Jaime for his help in researching some of our older watches.  I've said it before--service is 24k--pure gold.  That's what we got here.    We will certainly be returning.  I even noted that they make and cast custom jewelry here--something for us to consider for the future.  In the meantime, please head over here if you are looking for appraisals, want to shop for coins or jewelry, or need a few $$$ for scrap jewelry around your house.  Five very enthusiastic stars.

Perfect match!  Our daughter has been taking ballet lessons for years, so when we had to stop sending her to classes over a year ago for financial reasons, it was a source of regret for all of us.  She really enjoys ballet and dance in general and we wanted to get her back into classes as soon as we could.  Several months ago, we were driving by and our sharp-eyed Miss spots Dance 101 through the car window.  When the time came that we felt comfortable sending her to ballet again, this was the first place my wife wanted to check out.  She liked what she saw from the very start.  It was a very new place, but they seemed to have the professionalism and approach that we thought would be right for our daughter.  We started her up and she clicked with her teacher right away.  The folks here are rigorous and thorough with lessons, but fun and with a laid-back attitude.  The clincher came when we went to Barry's Dance Theatre Shop in Scottsdale to get our daughter fitted for new pointe shoes.  We told him that we started her up at Dance 101 and his eyes lit up, "Oh you're seeing Emily!"  That was all I needed to hear.  If Dance 101 has the Barry seal of approval, it's good enough for me.  He's been in the biz for years and knows his stuff.  If you are thinking about starting your child off in dance, this is the perfect spot.  If your child is no newbie but still needs to continue her or his education, they have a place ready for her or him here.  Bringing business to great businesses is what I'm all about.  Letting all of you know about Dance 101 and places like it is the main reason why I'm on Yelp.

LabCorp, you know, the place where you get blood drawn.  This is the Tempe location, notable because it is open on Saturdays.  On Saturdays, they open at 9am and EVERYONE wants to be first.  Get there at 9:05 and the place will be packed.  The guy who took my blood was relaxed, friendly, and very good at what he was doing.  If you don't mind a wait sometimes, this is a good place to go if you need labwork done.

I need to Xpress my appreciation for this place.  Hummus Xpress is all about cafeteria-style, mix and match Mediterranean food.  You start with a plate, a bowl, or a pita, then pick a meat (or an non-meat, or no meat), some veggies (lots of choices), some hummus (or not) and then a salad and rice (or not), and then maybe a sauce (or not).  Do it yourself--get a lot of a little or a little of a lot--however you want it.  There's always many choices.  Their hummus is shot through with kale and cilantro--enough to add greens and a little spice, but not too much.  Falafel?  Fala-full of flavor.  Nothing is pre-made, EVERYTHING is fresh.  Great taste, great price, nice and fast, extreme service.  Good for lunch or dinner or a snack.  Veggie friendly.  Work nearby? Lunch.  Live nearby?  They deliver.  Do it.

First!  Pretty new spot, so I wanted to say something about it.  This is probably the largest QT I have been to yet.  Not only do they have a big selection of drinks, but they also have the widest selection of slushie drinks that I have ever seen at QT.  Tons of chips, hot dogs, and other foods are to be found here.  A HUGE plus is the pretzel bar--use a computer touch screen to order your own custom-made pretzel.  You'll get it quick and with a smile.  They have gas too.  This QT's location makes it easy to get to from the freeway or from the local neighborhood.  The 7-Elevens and Circle Ks don't have the deluxe selection that this place brings--and even most QTs won't offer this much.  This is my most recommended convenience store in the Valley--big, clean, and full of good snacks and drinks.  If you're in the area and you need refreshment, bypass the spots on Baseline and come here.

"It's not a party until the perogies come out."  I agree, and on Thursday nights, it's all you can eat perogies here at Beaver Choice.  For one small price, you can scoop up as many pan fried and steamed perogies as you can eat.  Of course, you're not limited to the perogi feast.  They also have their regular menu--a selection of Scandanavian, Polish, and Canadian dishes, with a sprinkling of other tastes as well.  Everything is very fresh!  I recommend the schnitzel.  You don't see food like this very often.  Rest assured, when you have it here, it will be of the highest quality and served up by an ultra-friendly staff.  The owner loves what she does, and it really shows.  My wife and I are glad that we decided to start coming here.  Beaver Choice is the right choice when we are looking for a taste that's just a little different, and yet very delicious.  I think you'll agree.

Sunday night.  Work night.  We made it Chinese food night.  China Jade was good enough to leave a flyer on our doorknob, so we decided to take them up on the opportunity.  Small, not a lot of seating here.  However, there aren't a lot of folks here either and I'm ready for a veggie chow fun plate.  Took a little longer than we expected to get our food, but maybe they had a lot of deliveries that night.  I had a very delicious, BIG plate of chow fun for $8.  My wife ordered the egg foo young dinner special and she enjoyed it too.  Apart from the food and the friendly service, we noticed what a happening place this is.  Not many people were eating at the restaurant itself, but there was a steady stream of folks coming in ordering food to go.  This place is popular and busy-- I'm not surprised.  With tasty food at a nice price, people seem to stop by here often for a meal.  After our experience here, we will too.  Haven't been here yet?  Give them a try.

My wife and I are hailing to the Kings.  This place specializes in Mexico City cooking, and in particular, the torta sandwich.  LOTS of different kinds of tortas  My wife and I are vegetarians, and generally do not eat tortas.  However, there are a variety of other dishes here that will keep us coming back.  BIG portions!  CHEAP!  They don't serve enchiladas or chile rellenos, but they do have great burritos with a distinct flavor.  Their chocoflan also makes a fantastic sweet end to a meal.  If you're looking for authentic Mexico City flavor, this is the place and the locals know it.  Service is generally friendly, the place is clean, and there is always futbol on the television when you sit down.  Highly recommended.  Los Reyes de la Torta:  GOOOOOOOOOOOAL!

With all of the hamburger and hot dog places clustered in Tempe, it takes a lot to stand out.  Detroit Coney Grill has that special something.  The patties in their burgers are thin, but they offer a "quint" or five patty burger that is like a double burger elsewhere.  Absolutely fresh, delicious, and juicy.  Order it any way you like and you'll get it to your table quick and with a smile.  Want more food?  You can get more patties--order 18 if you like and eat 'em if you can.  ASU students please take note--wanna do your own "Man vs. Food?"  Here's a delicious spot to do it!  Fries are fresh cut and tasty, and drinks are bottomless.    One of the top burgers in Tempe--TRY IT.

No lunks!  How about another five star review for this place?  A "lunk" is PF's caricature for the gruff sort of guy who hangs out at gyms, slams his weights, grunts, drinks out of a gallon water container, and laughs at your small muscles (it's called "gymtimidation").  Show any of these traits at this PF, and they will literally set off an alarm bell with a blue siren (the "lunk alarm").  I saw it go off once on a guy who grunted in the weights area.  The whole shtick is that this isn't a gym, it is Planet Fitness.  You know, I like that.  The folks here are really friendly, the prices are right, and they have pretty much any piece of equipment you would need to get in shape.  Busy?  Try their 30 minute workout--perfectly paced to shape you up in your limited schedule.  You can also try their infrared and UV booths, as well as water jet massage tables and massage chairs.  It's open 24 hours a day, every day except principal holidays.  If you need to get in shape, strengthen those biceps, or lose a few pounds (or 10, or 20, or 50), you can get what you want here, no pressure.

A new pizza concept.  You can now get a pizza made at Fired Pie just like they make burritos at Chipotle.  You get your pick of crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings (or pick one of their set recipes).  Once your order is in, you sit down and get your pie in a matter of minutes (even when the place is crowded).  Taste?  Easily better than a lot of pizza joints out there.  Pies are only individual size-- 11 inches, but that will fill you up nice.  I even tried a piece of their gluten-free crust at one point and found it of surprisingly good taste and body.  The decor is hip, quite unlike the funky industrial shop vibe at Chipotle.  Yes, it's loud, but you'll have too much fun eating your delicious pizza to care.  It's a great, fast, lunch, dinner, or substantial snack.  Next time you're hungry, head out to Fired Pie and experience the flavor of this great new spot.

We didn't expect to come here to eat tonight, but our planned outing to RigaTony's went bust due to a 30+ minute wait for a table.  Still in the Italian mood, we were headed for VinciTorio's when we saw Fusion.  Mediterranean food?  Sure!  The meal opened with excellent service and about the freshest falafel I've ever had.  There's a comforting feeling about the place--it's family-run.  The owner's young daughter walks around the floor of the restaurant (no bother at all) and came up to our table and smiled at us while the waiter took our order.  The beef kabobs were. . .sublime.  Tasty cubes of meat on ghee-coated basmati rice.  In some places beef juices soaked a bit into the rice making it even more incredible. Even better, the salad was ROMAINE lettuce, not iceberg.  Quality.   My wife had the beef gyro with a rice noodle and lentil dish that was the Mediterranean version of mac & cheese.  My daughter had a falafel gyro.  Dessert?  Yes.  I have never had a baklava with a taste this complex before.  Huge pieces of pistachio nuts blended their flavor with dough, honey, and spices to make a pastry that was not too sweet, but just perfect in taste and texture.  My wife and I agree that this is the best Mediterranean food place we have been to in the Valley--by far.  The owner also tells us that he is going to be introducing more seafood and Caribbean cuisine to his menu soon.  Talk about fusion.   I'm game.  We are going to be visiting this place again in the near future!

I have been waiting for months for this place to open.  It just opened tonight--12/13/13.  Wow--now that was a unique treat.  I got the Italian Ice in Bada Bing Cherry.  This ain't no slushie or Slurpee.  When you get something like what they serve you in a 7-Eleven, you usually end up with an overly sweet half-frozen mess that already has an inch of melted candy water at the bottom by the time you leave the store.  This thing I had was COMPLETELY different here at Joe's.  This dessert had just about the consistency of fine wet sand--the kind you make sand castles with.  It was shot through with little chunks of fresh cherries.  The taste was intense, but just sweet enough.  The most amazing thing about this Ice was that it didn't melt in the container AT ALL.  From the time I first started eating it until the moment I scooped out the last morsel at the bottom of the cup, it was frozen.  It didn't melt until it was in my mouth.  This stuff just held together.  The taste never waned either--it didn't get flat or watery tasting towards the end.  Just a great sweet treat from start to finish.  As for the place itself, it's got a hodge podge of antiques scattered about--some fairly nice ones as well.  They're all laid out in themes--there's a row of old fans, a wall of old license plates, an old phone booth, stuff from ships, etc.  Cool retro ambiance.  Service was very friendly, and overall this was just a fun place to boost your mood and liven up your taste buds.  Everyone around, come on up and visit this hip new Italian Ice and ice cream joint that just opened up in Tempe.  My whole family loved it.  Now that you know about it, you just gotta try it out.

We came here only because my wife was in the mood for sushi and Hon Machi was closed.  Thank you, Hon Machi, for being closed, because this gave us the opportunity to try this phenomenal new restaurant now on our rotation.    Are you looking for sushi?  Gogi's got it fresh and tasty, and they'll serve you a lot! (See picture)  Teryaki?  YES, with BIG hunks of meat.  I have had Chicken Teriyaki in a lot of places, and this place seriously surprised me with how much juicy, fresh chicken they put on my plate.  Like fried calamari?  This isn't the Italian type!  No rings or small tentacle bunches--you get strips and large, whole crispy tentacles.  Not as tender as the ones I'm used to, but very delicious!  While the place is primarily Korean, there's a good deal of Japanese and even Chinese dishes here as well.  There's enough choices to make anybody happy, so go here and bring your friends or family--or both.  When a lot of the other sushi houses are closed in the afternoon until 5pm, they are open.  Don't wait or hesitate--GO to GOGI.

Apparently, you either really like the Texas Roadhouse, or you really hate it.    We liked it--a lot.  We didn't expect this place to set the bar so high for a slab of beef, but this place KILLS Sizzler on both quality and price.  We thought that it even edged out other prominent steak places like Outback, Longhorn, and Black Angus for quality, while totally beating them in price.  Maybe we'll go there sometime and they'll suck, but they didn't this time.  Good service, great steak and great price--we will be back to Texas Roadhouse.  Just one warning--allergic to nuts?  Don't get within 10 feet of the door.  There's peanut shells everywhere.

Hot dog paradise.  Seriously--what could be better than a delicious chili dog on a fluffy poppy seed bun?  When you're at Portillo's, there's nothing else that compares.  At this point, I think that this is my favorite hot dog joint in town.  This is also my wife's favorite spot for her Chicago dogs.  Lots of seating here--great service in early '60s diner surroundings.  You have to come here and have a bite.  Inside and outside seating available.

In the mood for hand-crafted, home-brewed zines?  You can peruse the tables at First Fridays, or you can come here to the Wasted Ink Zine Distro, a zine distribution and retail shop in Tempe, minutes from ASU.  Proprietors Charissa and Marna threw a grand opening event on Sunday, 6 December that was attended by makers and fans of home-print media.  We were there--lots of vendors and great conversation.  If you missed it, you can still come by their shop and browse through the zine library or sample the ever-changing variety of micro-brew publications.  Come support this woman-owned, local business.  Definitely worth a visit.

Yeah.  A change of pace from your more standard "Mediterranean" or "Middle Eastern" joint, Moroccan Paradise offered up a delicious meal tonight for my family.  One of the specialties here is the tajine, or meat dish in sauce with vegetables and prunes with rice.  My wife really enjoyed hers, and my daughter equally liked the vegetable version with falafel.  As for me, I got the mixed grill--a fabulous combo of beef kabob, kefta kabob, chicken kabob, and chicken leg, served over rice and accompanied by salad, pita slices, and fried potatoes.  I'm full.  No baklava here, but they make up for it with huge array of mixed juices, milkshakes, and crepes.  The desserts take up multiple pages on the menu!  This is easily one of our favorite restaurants of its kind now.  We will be coming back--even if just for dessert. :)  Not just "Middle Eastern" or "Mediterranean"-- it's More Rockin'.  Give it a try.

Okay Senor, you have my attention.  We've been to this location as a Jack in the Box countless times, so we were waiting to see what place was set up to replace it.  Turns out that it's pretty darned good!  Love their beef enchiladas!  The service here is a little longer than many drive-thrus, but the taste is worth it.  If you want a sit down, more formal Mexican meal, by all means go to La Fonda a short walk away. . .but. . .pssst. . .Senor Taco tastes better.  Not to be mean, it's just. . .fact.  We love this place, and prefer it over a lot of other Mexifood joints that are much more expensive.  This is one of those places where you really can get GREAT taste and a full stomach for a low price.  Give it a try.
