I have been going to "TLC" for a couple years now.  This is a great spot located near the movies at the Scottsdale 101 shopping center.  The number one thing, in my opinion, about restaraunts is consistency.  I have never been let down here.  I usually get the same thing everytime i go so I cant really comment on the depth of the menu.  But if you like Summer spring rolls which are packed with noodles, shrimp, pork, chicken wrapped in rice paper you will love the ones at Tea Light.  I follow the summer rolls with a huge bowl of chicken soup.  This soup has a phenominal flavor with asian noodles and a genorous amount of tasty chicken.  There are sauces left out on the tables so you can make your soup as spicy hot as you want.  The very casual order counter and friendly service allows for an evironment that makes you feel like you are at the neighhborhood Cafe.  You will see the same people there everytime and they are as nice and appreciative of your business as they can be.   If you are looking for a good lunch or a healthy dinner...TLC is your spot!

Houstons is probably my favorite restaurant.  I have been going there since I was a little kid in Maryland and havent stopped.  I have seen the menu change (no more cheese bread...unless you ask), I have seen the prices go up, and now I have seen the addition of sushi.  Who would have thought...Houston's and sushi.  Kind of a weird combo.  But I will tell you it works.  I have tried two of the rolls and both were fantastic.  Mango Tuna and Spicy Tuna.  Definitly give it a shot as an appetizer or for your next meal.  Very filling as the rolls are fairly large.    Service is always great (Rainy is my favorite bartender in town).  Atmosphere is very nice, people very friendly as I usually sit at the bar.  Houston's is a no brainer when you cant decide where to eat.  Never a bad meal.

Wow...where to begin with this place?  I call up the night of going there to see if a reservation was needed.  They tell me they always suggest a reservation....so i proceed to see if they have anytime available for 8 o clock that evening.  They do...Great!!  I head over to Sutra which is the "new" sushi place to go to in scottsdale.  Excited to try some new sushi in town we walk in to an 80% empty restaurant wondering why they suggested we make a reservation??  The restaurant looked identical to the previous lounge that occupied this space, La Rouge.  There were minimal changes and the same furniture remained which i thought was disappointing.  I thought they would have given Sutra its own identity.  They might as well had called it La Rouge and told people they now serve sushi.  The next disappointing thing about Sutra was the service....BRU-TAL!!  Im talking painful to sit through.  The waitress came over and introduced herself and asked if we wanted drinks.  We wanted to see their wine list along with the martini list.  She had to make two seperate trips to find both of these menus.  Finally she delivered the menus to us as if they were the only menus in the restaurant and we were lucky to have received them.  Then, after looking over the sushi menu for 20 minutes and finally deciding on what we wanted, the waitress came over to look over our order and make sure she was aware of everything we wanted.  After she looked it over she asks, ":Oh, did they tell you what the deal was tonight??"  We all looked at each other and said, "No, whats the deal here tonight?'  She says, "We are not serving any hot food tonight and any of the sushi that contains tempura (a fried breading) is not available, however, edamame and miso soup are still available.  Hmmm...."Why didnt they mention that when i made a reservation" I pondered.  And why didnt the server mention this the first three times she visited our table for that matter.  Half the items that we ordered were immediatly eliminated and we had to go back to the drawing board and figure out what we wanted.  Finally, we decide and the waitress takes our order.  As the night progressed the service and experience just got more interesting.  The food was brought out by runners and the waitress had no clue what had been brought out and what hadnt.  She was asking US what still needed to come out.  Kinda weird...thought that was her responsibility to know what still needed to come out??  So after eating a few mediocre rolls of sushi we all decided that we were full and couldnt eat anymore.  We asked the server to cancel the last two dishes that hadnt arrived yet.  She looked at us like we were from Mars and said, "Oh, you guys didnt get everything?"  She canceled the remaining dishes and proceeded to talk to us for literally a half hour.  "About what" you are wondering.  I have no clue...all i know is that i felt 1000 times dumber after she was done.  So, I think you get the idea.  This place should live about as long as La Rouge did...and hopefully not that long.  This was a painful dining experience.  Very disappointing coming from the people that own Barcelona and Danny's car washes.  This dinner was more annoying than the guys at the car washes that ask you if you want your windshield repaired everytime you go to fill up!  SUCKED...Dont go!

True Food was the most recent of my new lunch spots to try.  Very cool environment inside with kind of the "green" concept.  Everything, or atleast I think everything, is locally grown, organic type food.  You kinda have a healthy feeling in there.  I ordered the Sashimi Tuna salad which was fantastic.  They are very generous on the tuna as you get some with every bite until the end.  It is also filled with cucumbers, edamames, tomato, avacado, and ginger dressing.  I'm not sure if it was healthy but it felt healthy for some reason.     The staff was very friendly and the decor is pretty neat.  Its a very open space and I think they even have some community seating in the front.  I happen to sit at the bar where you could watch them make fresh "Natural Refreshments" as they call them.  As nice as everyone was they do have some kinks to work out as all new establishments do.  I ordered a hot green tea and the server was very excited to take my order.  About 3 minutes later she came back and said she didnt forget about the tea she was just waiting on a tea pot?  I was a lil confused?  Did they not order enough tea pots when they opened?  Couldnt she just make it and put it in some other glass?  I mean tea is just a tea bag and some hot water right?  I didnt suggest these ideas to her so i just patiently waited.  About 20 minutes later after i had finished my salad I said "Do you have the tea?" She was still waiting for a tea pot and replied with a smile, "I didn't forget about you Im still waiting for the tea pots.  They are going through storage in the back and getting some cleaned up for you."  I thought to myself, "okkkk".  In the end, I did get my green tea.  However, I never got it in the pot.  She put it in a to go cup for me in which the lid didnt really fit.  Why she didnt do that to begin with so i could enjoy the tea with my meal was beyond me.  HAAA!!  Bottom line- Good food!  Everything i saw go by smelled and looked very good.  Just ask if they have tea pots BEFORE you order your hot tea.  Cool decor!  Oh! and definitly go to the bathroom.  Cool waterless urinals which they tell you saves 40,000 gallons of water a year and cool powerful eco-friendly hand dryers!

My friend Carrie and I decided to stop at Blanco on the way back from the Scottsdale Culinary Festival.  Yep, kinda ironic, we needed more food and drinks after a culinary festival.  I have been wanting to try the latest addition to the Borgata.  If you like good margaritas and good food than this place is perfect.  If you dont....you need help!  A great relaxing atmosphere on the patio with margaritas that go down....oh so smooth!! We tried one of their flat bread cheese crisp type appetizers which was a perfect compliment to my drink.  Is the drink supposed to compliment the food?? oops!  The chips and salsa were also good and add the guacamole for some extra flare!  Cool place, nice atmosphere, and good food to top it off!  Ill be back!

Today was the second visit for me to Press Coffee in the new City North Shopping center. By far best coffee I have had in town. I must admit I'm a frequent visitor to Starbucks because there are about 3 within 2 miles of my house, however if you are looking for a quality cup of coffee....Press is your place.   I'm a big fan of supporting the local coffee shop and hope you will too. Even if it is a little out of the way for you it will be worth it for your morning or even afternoon coffee fix. I haven't tried the food yet but from what I saw they have some mighty fine looking homemade sandwiches and pastries. They also sell wine by the bottle if your day is calling for that kinda fix.   So support the local mom and pop shops and give Press Coffee a shot. Oh, and by the way, my soy cappuccino was $.10 cheaper than Starbucks. Start saving today!

I will be back to this place.  Its simple, clean, good atmosphere, good concept.  Grab a cup, grab some yogurt, grab some toppings, weigh the cup, pay for the cup.  Its that simple, its that good!

Its not offen im in the mood for pizza but this is a great option.  They deliver, it seems healthier than normal pizza (eventhough its prob not), and they have great unique pizza toppings.  Give it a shot...if you like the "california" style pizza you will like "Z"
