Easy to order and the flowers looked amazing! The place I sent the flowers to was in a corporate building with a suite number and they had no issue finding it and delivered right on time. Definitely recommend.

Came for the fish tacos, did not get to eat fish tacos. Apparently they can only be ordered at the bar during happy hour and "since they aren't on the normal menu, we can't make them". What?! You have them on your happy hour bar menu and are fully capable of making them throughout the day if you already have everything you need to make a fish taco ready to go in the kitchen. I ended up getting the chicken apple walnut salad which wasn't bad but the apples were mushy and had no taste.

If you go here, I recommend just getting one of everything. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is well matched. SO GOOD!!
