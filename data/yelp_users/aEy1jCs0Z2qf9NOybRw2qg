I have to preface by saying I'm a Penn and Teller fan from the start.  So the hubby and I were excited to go see their Vegas show.  We watch "Bullshit" and all their specials.  That being said, don't go to this show if you want a big, spectacular, exciting magic show.  They are more down to earth, they banter to the crowd, call people up, get a little preachy (Penn), swallow fire, juggle, show you how tricks are done....but it's still a damn good time.  WE had a BLAST.    My suggestion is sit as close to the stage as possible.  We were in the 3rd row and even though we could see everything up close, we were still amazed.  My fave:  Goldfish trick

We had an amazing meal here.  Starting with the lovely bread basket, especially the blue corn muffins, everything was really just solid.  We shared the prawn tamale as a starter and it was perfect.  Very tasty for something so incredibly simple.  Moving on to mains, two of us had the filet mignon which I have to say was amazing.  I dont' often find filet to be so flavorful but this had a perfectly spicy crust and a mushroom sauce that complimented but didn't overpower.    My firends had the scallops and both were pleased with their meal.  For sides we had the pesto mashed potatoes which were creamy and tasted great and the spinach which, unfortunately, was nothing special.  The wine list was nothing special...too bad, because I would have like a better selection.  The service was absolutely excellent.  I would recommend.  A lot of times the Vegas outlets of good restaurants don't live up to the original but this one most definitely does.

I stayed in the spa tower.  Had a lovely room-spacious and a great big bathroom which really, is the best part.  Because I can sleep in a small space but I need a big bathroom.  Nice big shower, separate tub, double sink.  WAY bigger than the Mirage bathrooms (where I stayed in May).  I had stayed at the Bellagio a few years ago and we had terrible service.  I'm happy to say that this time the service was amazing.  Very helpful staff and friendly front desk and operators.  They have a great pool with several different little side pools and a nice pool side cafe.    Also, check out the beautiful botanical gardens and the worlds largest chocolate fountain while you are there!

Rooms are comfortable and spacious here but the bathrooms are atrociously small.  The pool is quite nice but again, smaller than it looks in the website.  The casino is BORING.  The buffet is decent.  There is a Starbucks and a McDonalds on premises.  Small but decent sports book.  Why so lowly rated?  WELL.........the service here SUCKS. If the Monte Carlo manager reads Yelp, then take heed...your front desk staff is misinformed on MC policies, can be quite rude, and are most definitely NOT customer serviced focused.

I am not a "buffet person."  I don't like to eat that much at one sitting.  And in Vegas, I'd rather wasted the calories on alcohol quite frankly.  But after a night of drinking and gambling and making an ass of myself, the waffles, made to order omelets, bountiful coffee, and bacon-bacon-bacon really hit the spot. The servers are sweet here, the line moves fast and it won't break the bank.  And for what it's worth, the breakfast is REALLY good.

Hubby and I wanted one really GOOD meal in Vegas when we were there.  We also wanted a place we could walk to and since we stayed at the Signature, we first looked at all the MGM restaurants.  I suggested CraftSteak.  Even though I have a crush on Tom Collechio, I don't think that justifies $120 per person for dinner.  We liked the varied menu at Seablue more so we made a reservation.  I have to say, from the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable.  I don't know if that's a Michael Mina thing or an MGM thing but it is duly noted.  The decor and ambiance of Seablue really impressed us as well.  We sat against a beautiful aqua wall that was a fountain and it was quite serene and relaxing.  The dining room also wasn't too loud, which was impressive.  So they start you off with "bread."  As noted in several reviews, this is delicious flatbread with three types of dips (hummus, egg plant, and feta spread).  Delicious...I didn't need an appetizer.  Also, they have a build your  own salad option, which I exercised (baby lettuce, beets, fresh bufala mozz, cherry tomatoes.  YUM!  Neither hubby or I are big fans of oysters so I can't tell you if they were good but they had many types to choose from.  We moved on to our own version of surf and turf.  I got the filet and hubby got the two pounds of king crab legs and we split them between the two of us...see?  We made our own surf and turf, isn't that great?  We're so smart.    We both had two glass of wine as well and the bill was $170 so not too terrible but definitely a splurge.  I recommend Seablue for a lovely dining experience.  The food is very good, the service is amazing and it's away from the ding ding ding of the slot machines.

This was another "on the company" dinner.  That being said, I have to say that it was excellent sushi.  I had the albacore and the yellowtail and both were melt in my mouth perfect.  Seriously.  I also had the popcorn shrimp with chili oil that was done very well.  My friend had the udon and she is a PICKY Asian food eater...she raved.  Said she'd go back in a heartbeat--which is quite a compliment.  Service was good.    Now all that being said, it was expensive for what you get.  Of course, it IS Vegas so what do you expect?

Fun fun fun!!!!!!!  Ok, I admit...I'm a sucker for a hot dude with a ripping body dancing really badly to cheesy music.  And if you are too (and I know that you are) you will find this show quite entertaining.

Oh Vegas.  How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.  Gambling, drinking at all hours, hot dudes and chicks, gambling, magic shows, Prince impersonators, gambling, drinking.  Hey did I say gambling and drinking?  If you loathe the smell of cigs in your beautiful, naturally curly hair like I do...stay at the Signature.  It's smoke free.  It's also casino free...but that's ok with me because a 5 minute walk drops you right into the MGM casino.  No biggee.  I absolutely LOVED the rooms here.  They were quite spacious with a huge bathroom, complete with jacuzzi tub that you know the hubster and I christened.  Room 21-819 if you were wondering.  Each room has a kitchenette with all the amenities, big flat screen TV with actual channels to watch, a desk, a couch, a plush and comfy bed.  Good toiletries too if you go for that sort of stuff.  I was sad to be away from my munchkin for 2 days...but the drinking and gambling made up for it.

I don't know about you, but I'm all into cheaper gambling tables.  If I'm going to lose all my money, I'd like to do it as slowly as possible.  The tables here have lower limits and the dealer are all super nice and funny.  I had not been here since Bill's bought it but it's really no different from the old Barbary Coast. At least as far as casinos go.  Take a break from the Vegas glitz and glamour and have some fun at Bills.

They need to work out the kinks, that's for sure.  Diablo's?  Pray to the devil that you get your food warm and you can see it.  1.  The lighting was SO low up top that they had to turn on the disco lights which were then blaring in our eyes. 2.  Food came out COLD.  No joke.  We had four plates of tacos and all were cold.  The fajitas were sizzling though. 3.  Salsa is excellent.  So good, I asked for a refill.  Um, ok, they charged me $6 for salsa refill.  EXCUSE ME?   4. Drinks were extra strong, but they should be for $10.  And they didn't have Ketel One.  That was a $10 Stoli. 5. Waitress was very sweet and trying really really hard. 6.  Bartenders downstairs (the girls) were absolutely clueless and it took two of them to figure out how to run a credit card--while 5 of us were still waiting to get served.  Thankfully the guy bartender was on the ball and stepped up to the plate.  He also flashed "Blue Steel."  That bartender deserves 5 stars. 7.  I finally complained at the end about the cold food and why were they charging me $6 for salsa when the food they brought out was sub par?  So the manager took off the salsa charge and the $8 chip charge as well.  Besides all that, the atmosphere is pretty cool.  I think the downstairs was better.  The hostesses that I encountered were very nice and inquired about our party, what was it for, making small talk.  Overall though, like I said, they need to iron out the kinks.

I had nothing short of an orgasmic experience here.  I have heard good things about Koi in LA but haven't tried it yet.  The Las Vegas outpost is excellent.  We had good drinks, good service, good music, good food, good view of the strip.  The best part?  The SVP with my group of work colleagues picked up the $900 tab.  Can I get a woot!  We started with tons of sushi, roll, and tuna appetizers.  The tuna with crispy onions and the tuna tartare were my favorite.  I ordered the black cod which was absolutely perfect.  A delicate and delicious cut of fish, cooked perfectly.  Washed it all down with three cosmos.  The drinks weren't too sweet either so kudos there.  Don't go expecting to not drop coin, it's pricey.  But what isn't in Vegas.  Also, keep the alchy flowing downstairs and go bet on black.

All I can say is, oh.my.god.  Purple Reign is amazing.  He looks like Prince, acts like Prince, sounds like Prince.  This show was fun, fun, fun.  IF  you like Prince.    We saw Purple Reign at the Monte Carlo Brew Pup.  The Monte Carlo is dead but PR draws them in.  they also play at the HOB Mandalay Bay and at Santa Fe Station.  People were dancing and having a GREAT time.  It's a very fun show and it's FREE!  If you do like Prince and dream of the days when you were young and Prince still had amazing music, go see this show.

This is a truly amazing oasis in a sea of cheese and debauchery.  Since we were sans little wee one on our naughty adult vacation to Sin City, we decided to pop over to the Springs Preserve and check it out.  It's a relatively new desert botanical garden and learning center.  Hubby is a science teacher so he was WAY excited to get his science groove on.  We went a little later than expected and only had a couple hours to spend but we easily could have spent at least 4 hours wandering the hiking trails and checking out the cool exhibits.  Basically this attraction has three parts...origin experience which has tons of cool interactive activities, films, and a little zoo of desert life, Desert Lving Center which is all about conservation, and Gardens/Trails which is a bunch of interconnected trails.  It was really cold when we were there so we didn't spend as much time as we like on the trails.  If you have some time and want to get away for a bit from the smoke and vice of the Strip, check out the Springs Preserve. It's really lovely.

I have eaten at all of the Sushi Sambas now.  Vegas is not the best one, unfortunately.    It's a cool space.  Very modern and cool looking.  Loved the open kitchen and the robata menu items which weren't available at other locations.  However.  The service sucked big old donkey balls.  Our waitress was SO rude, short and annoying.  She was mad because we wanted to order off the menu instead of having *her* pick our food and bring it out family style.  Why would we want her to pick our food?  I get the whole family style and how it makes it easier with larger parties, but at least tell a sister that when she makes a reservation instead of springing it on her when she sits down.   Then don't refuse to bring menus, get pissed when we ask for them, or be brusque and rude when taking orders or bringing food.  You better believe I talked to the management and gave them a (nice) earful.    But the food was good...as it is at all Sushi Sambas.  Especially the sea bass, the sushi, and the chicken robata.

We were staying with friends in Phoenix. She lives in Queen Creek.  She asked me to make the side dish one night and I suggested cous cous with raisins and walnuts.  Great, she replied.  I opened the cubbard to find some olive oil and spied the lemon olive oil made by QCOM.  Oh.my.god.  It added the best flavor to the cous cous.  I insisted that she take me there before I left.    Two days later we stopped over the Mill for lunch and a shopping spree of olive oil and "cremas."  The cremas are these deliciously flavored dipping/dressing/marinade sauces made with olive oil.  I got the sun dried tomato and the herb one and both were hits as appetizers with a cubed bagette.  Yuuuuuuu-um.  We also had a delightful lunch at their cafe.  Really lovely, fresh, unpretentious food.  I had the caprese sandwich which was amazing.  Hubby liked his rueben too.  If you are out east past Phoenix, do drop in to the mill.

My raves are not for the sweet potato fries, but rather the salmon burger.  Ok, I admit I was a little buzzed but that was the best damn salmon burger I ever had.  It had the perfect seasoning and I'm not sure what it was but it was like crack to this ho.    Kudos for perfect onion rings too.  And washed it all down with a glass of vino.  Not too shabby for what looks like a diner.  Good service too.

Great sandwiches!  Subway ain't got nothing on Potbelly!  Kids had skinny turkey sandwiches and I hubs and I had roast beef, me skinny and he not.  I love that whole concept of "skinny" where you are getting less bread and less meat but it's still super flavorful and just a little better for you.  Great tasting bread here too.  Overall, I would recommend it. Hard to mess up a sandwich, but I've seen it done.  They also have live music sometimes which is cool!
