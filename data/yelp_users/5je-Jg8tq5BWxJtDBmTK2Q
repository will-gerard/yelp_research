I took my boyfriend out to a rare date-night dinner at Richardson's because it is right down the street from our apt. It was very dark, hard to read the menus, but was perfect for our semi-romantic dinner. He was wary at first, because of the construction (especially the wobbly wooden plank leading the front door), but it was definitely love at first bite for us! YUM!  We were sat at the bar immediately, and got to skip the 45 minute wait for a table. The place cleared out all at once at 8:30, good for next time so we can have the restaurant to ourselves. I had the red chile alfredo pasta, which I ordered just for the bacon-wrapped shrimp and was very happy (though full after 5 bites - super rich!) Mr. BF had a severe case of food-envy going on. Sooo good.   My only wish was that there was a place to hang my coat, which was bulky enough on my lap to make eating neatly tricky, but other than that we will be returning without question. Oh and by the way...the male bartender is equally as quirky cute as the other!

The canal is my go-to for everday running. While I have a tough time repeating the same route over and over (my fitness STOPS in the summer because I refuse to use a treadmill), I do loops using the surface streets to create a new 3-6 miler every day!

Mojito Mondays! Cheapest and most incredible mojitos around! They have a million flavors to choose from....my fave is mango, but I'll try anything once.   I meet my stressed-out current and ex-coworkers here to unwind over drinks every couple of weeks. Get there early to find parking because the place fills up quickly for Monday happy hour! Epic.

Yikes, reading other reviews I realize my bad experience wasn't unique. As a server I make a very laid back customer. I like pretty much everything I eat and don't require a lot of attention from the waiter.   La Piccola Cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the house. Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken. Like other reviewers mentioned, he was frantic and made that clear to every customer. At one point I even saw him in the kitchen cooking - they need another person!   I left super stressed out from the experience, which is very, very unusual for me. You can either have bad service or bad food, but not both.

I love this place, especially because it's on my way home from the train. Good quality food (that I couldn't easily make myself) for perfectly reasonable prices. I don't buy meat at the grocery store so if I need an entree I can stop off and easily supplement my veggie/pasta basics with something unique and tasty.   When I went in the staff was super friendly, even when I got a little indulgent and over-sampled. Yum yum!

Two words: Fresh jalepenos. Spicy, non-pickled, delish!   We had a great experience when we were there in late afternoon on Sunday - good service, no waits, killer wine list.   Massive burgers - I'm taking the boyfriend back there for date night sometime very soon.

Hopefully my review will balance out those early bad ones because Burger Studio deserves a higher rating than two stars.   The food was very tasty - the bun was my favorite part - big, light, and fresh. I had a caprese burger with a turkey patty and a side of pesto-mayo. I ate every bite - it was extremely flavorful and delish.  The staff were friendly, both the cook and the cashier checked on us during our meal and left us alone after that.   The decor was cute - it's always entertaining to eat somewhere that feels "trendy". The funniest part of the meal was when I turned around in my chair and saw the stainless steel "wet....exciting" sign describing the burgers behind me. I almost choked on a tator tot - ha!  One complaint: THEY USE STYROFOAM CUPS. How unnecessary and wasteful. I was horrified and gave the cashier some crap about that. I would have given five stars to drive up the average on this place...but those cups make my heart hurt and I just can't bring myself to do it.   We'll be back.

After a good morning workout I like to reward myself with a nonfat latte instead of my regular home brew, so I stopped by Luci's on my way back from Dreamy Draw. I have to echo Laura E. - I'm in love! The big garage door was wide open and I ordered my coffee in the gorgeous morning sunshine (which probably doesn't help my already bad case of spring fever) while the adorable barista boys chatted with me about my St. Patty's Day.   The best part was looking across the street at the Starbucks crammed with 30 cars in the drive-thru and knowing that my morning was likely to be more lovely and peaceful at Luci's.   I love Luci's for their nice ambiance, unique products, warm and welcoming service and because it's a perfect location for where I live and work.   One final note - they sell Full Sail Session Lager from my home state of Oregon that I absolutely love. I'll be back soon for lunch, and hopefully my four stars will become five!

I'm so glad I have a nice coffee shop within walking distance of my office! Though the location is a plus, the real reason I have become a regular is that they open earlier than Lux - 6 am - and have free WiFi. During a two month string of early morning test prep, the openers remembered me and asked about my progress on a daily basis.  My favorite part about Urban Bean is that ALL of their products are compostable and they run a compost in the back.   The only reason I didn't give five stars is because they have yet to add large tables (for two or three people to spread out books to study). Other than that - it's my fave!

Booo I had a terrible experience here. I went to get my car cleaned on a Saturday at 3 pm. They charged $25 for a basic inside/outside wash ($15 at Danny's). Then I fought off the $200 detail upgrade and chip replacement people for five minutes.   I got in my car when they were through and looked directly into my cupholder which still had coffee drips and crumbs - great! They missed several other spots in addition to that and left trash on the front seat. My final gripe was that a homeless guy was bothering me the whole time while I waited. Not their fault, but it made the whole experience a little worse.   I hate to complain publicly like this...but it was awful and I wouldn't wish that kind of rip-off on anyone.

I just had Eco Maids do my whole apartment - it's sparkling! A few things were left undone, but I'd heard the gals talking about how they ran over time. They stayed an extra 15 mins to finish up. They were very nice and if I could afford consistent cleaning, I would go for it. Maybe I'll be able to justify a quarterly deep clean? Hooray for Eco friendly products - I wouldn't consider using any other service.

I had a great time getting takeout from this place. The owner was there with his little girls and one other employee and was a blast to chit chat with all of them. Great service.   The food was delicious. My boyfriend and I split three: the Chicago dog, the Cheesesteak dog, and a Reuben dog. The Reuben was topped with an onion ring and was to die for! Going back I'll hold the cheese sauce on the Cheesesteak and probably order a fourth dog. Two each would have left us stuffed, but one each just wasn't enough.   I hope they come up with some good vegetarian options so I can justify going there more often. Also, they should add a spicy challenge to their food challenge!   For those that say the location is unfortunate I disagree. It's right across from the Central and Camelback park and ride which makes it extremely convenient for all of us light rail commuters. Many dinners in my future will be takeout from the Dawg Father on my way home. What a great find!

Yummy! Though there are quite a few ice cream/yogurt places on Mill Ave this one is my favorite. Very friendly service and a great deal. I'd give 5 stars but it's a personal rule of mine to never give 5 stars to a place that still gives styrofoam. I suggest having some lunch at La Bocca then popping next door for dessert. Salted Caramel Cookies with Dulce de Leche ice cream!
