Pizza is inconsistent. Sometimes under cooked, other times cut disturbingly wrong ( sad when half of it is for a vegetarian ). Forget ordering chicken wings! It's like pulling teeth!!!! How hard is it to get " medium bone out "? 4 out of 5 times it's anything but! Last night was the straw that broke camels back when we found out that this time they gave us honey BBQ. After calling the manager to let her know of the mistake, she replies "I guess some one else got your wings". Really!? An apology would have been more appreciated then a sarcastic comment! I don't recommend going to this Pizza Hut. The service is worse then the neighborhood it sits in. I wish there was a negative star I could rate this place.

Great customer service, food is made to your liking. The only negative is, I wish they could do something about the bums infesting the area. It can be a little bit of a deterrent when females go in alone.

Service is fairly decent. Don't expect to hear "can I help you here" but a "what do you need" look. The food is a little above average. Serving size is large, guacamole is fresh, tortilla's are warm & flan is delicious. I recommend the fish taco's, the chile relleno burro and calling in your orders.

This place charges a cover charge?! We should be paid to come in there! It's in a horrible place in town, drinks or retardedly over priced & the parking is ridiculous. The inside of the club only smells more worse then the urinal because the little tiny room they call a bathroom is 2x2! You can't pay me to come back there. I wish I had known how horrible this place was before I got suckered into going & basically throwing away my money.

The helpful female behind the counter casually taking my double whopper meal order just a few mins before closing with a  friendly smile on her face was enough to forget your in a sketchy area late at night. I very much enjoy my endless options at the soda machine and the clean tables in the dining area.

Service was great. It seems like everything was marinated in oil then deep fried. Kinda turned my stomach. Then topping it all off with a chocolate and strawberry shake wasn't the smartest idea. I like how the waitresses dress in their cute 60's dresses and that the diner is in one big RV. I guess that made up for the mediocre food.

Deep fried chile relleno is so yummy. It's been a weekly habit of mines for months now. How could you pass up a $4 burrito stuffed with 2 chile rellenos, pico de gallo, guacamole & sour cream? The hardest part is stopping at one. God bless the Mexicans and their delicious food!

As long as you go in not expecting authentic Hawaiian food, you shouldn't be too disappointed. The menu has changed a couple times in recent years (no garlic shrimp just fried shrimp, no French fries, optional Asian salad) but the mac salad has remained the same. There isn't much to choose from for the non-meat eater. The fried shrimp is too oily for my taste.

I love that every time I walk in to a Chipotle, no matter how many people are in line I still walk out within 5 mins. Their veggie bowl with brown rice, fajita style onions with bell peppers, black beans (the refried beans have bacon), corn, salsa, hot sauce, sour cream, guacamole, all topped with lettuce is ALWAYS on point. The staff is friendly and attentive. I love coming here.

With all the negative reviews on Yelp about this location, I have to admit I went in expecting to not even be acknowledged even though the on line check in stated no waiting time @ 2P on a Wednesday. But to my surprise, a friendly face did greet me as soon as I walked in. She chopped my hair exactly how I wanted it. My chunky over grown home slashed bangs were no longer a mess and soon my one length hair was styled beautifully with layers. I am 6" lighter and loving it. I would definitely come back without hesitation.

Service was friendly and fast, especially for being fairly busy and only having one person start the cooking and take the orders. I guess the other person was on break? Fat Burger is just as good in AZ and Cali as it is in Nevada. I order the veggie burger meal, my daughter a medium burger meal and my boyfriend the large burger meal. It came out to $31, and it was worth every bite. To save money next time we'll share soda's and save about $2 per drink since it's bottomless. :). Also if you wanted to save on time, call in the order. Remember Hidden Valley Ranch packet isn't free BUT sometime if you wait till the end and smile while asking nicely, you just might get it for free. :)

Friendly attentive service. $2 for a small wash load that take about 23 mins. Small load dries in about 30 mins for $4. Why have I never thought about taking my comforters to a laundromat instead of dry cleaning or sticking in my machine at home with tennis balls bouncing in the dryer? I can't believe I was in and out in less then 45 mins after washing and drying a small load.

I'm thankful this place was up for grabs on Groupon! Had it not been, I would have never ever even thought of walking in to this upscale looking bar craving a mouth watering $10.50 veggie burger! The service was friendly and professional. Burgers came in huge portions so I recommend skipping an appetizer. I was sad that i couldn't finish my fries. And I'm a total sucker for fries. I'll waste just about anything but not my fries. I can't wait to go back.

I lived in unit #1078 (which is in the north east corner of 13th Ave/ Van Buren) from April '11- May '13. Had it not been for my job being just 1 mile away, I would have chosen to stay else where. Paying $775 for a spacious 2x2 in down town is almost too good to be true. If your ok with the extreme noise pollution by walkers (the occassional drug user who likes to scream "F U N*ggers", the run aways, the homeless & the poor) or the heavy rail train just 6 streets west that blows its horn at exactly 11:31 every night (& doesn't ever miss a beat), the ambulances, fire truck & PD blaring their horns and of course the screeching of tires as they take turns too quickly, then this place is for you. Of course after a month or two, you just learn to block out the auto noise. Compared to it's surrounding areas, Legacy Bungalows is a beautiful place to live. The state park is next door and if you catch it just right during the day, there isn't too many homeless people camping out. In all fareness, PD does stay posted (most nights) @ the front of the office and he occasionally comes around checking door knobs and wonders thru the halls which gave me a false sense of security. I awoke to gun shots back in May of '12. Two gunmen were opening fire to someone on the north end of 13th Ave & were using my bedroom walls and balcony post as a shield. We picked up the bullets the next day and turned them in to the office to hopefully hand them over as evidence to PD even though we never did hear a cop car come by after we called 911 the night before. Things got progressively worse since. In October of '12 our unit was robbed between the hours of 8P-11P by a neighbor that lived in the back of the complex. We were 1 of 3 units that got hit that night. The front office was nice enough to offer another unit, but in a not so well lit area. And unfortunately we had just signed on to another 6 month lease so leaving all together wasn't an option. We learned to sleep w/ 1 eye open. Having people knock on our window in the early evenings only made us more observant. I have nothing but nice things to say of the professional staff @ the front office. My issues were always immediately taken care of & it was nothing ever really major. The grounds were always well manicured & parking was never a headache even though stalls weren't assigned. The pool area & gym was of a decent size & well kept. The business center and laundry room (even though all units came with full size washers and dryers) were a nice convenience. I don't recommend this place if you have another option. If safety is @ the utmost importance to you, then look else where.

I give this one star ONLY because the owner of the restaurant was considerate enough to hear my rant about his incompetent workers who could not for the life of me, take down a simple one hamburger plus fries phone order. An apology for my order would have apparently been too much, instead I got a "are you sure you called this location"? Ummm... You have another location?? I've had better service at McDonalds.

Best shrimp burro's. If it wasn't in the hood & make me cringe @ the thought of going in at night alone, I maybe would have given it 5 stars.  The staff is as friendly as any other Mexican spot. The place is kept decently clean. Don't let the outside totally deter you from at least stepping foot in the place. There's a couple TV's playing Mexican music video's to get your mind off of waiting for your order, which is surprisingly fast. Call in orders are necessary when your trying to beat the lunch rush. But any other time, you could be out the door in 10 minutes.  This place has been here for a while now. There is other La Salsita spots to go to in the valley. Some tweaked their spelling but all in all, best shrimp burro on this side of Van Buren!

I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about coming to a dive bar (with a 49 max occupancy sign) & having to pay a $5 cover charge on a Saturday night. But a few delicious (and wallet friendly) Long Island ice tea's later, I was really enjoying myself. To my surprise there was a female DJ who was spinning with her husband & I think she too loosened up after a drink. :D. What was really amazing was the cold AC kicking out of the vents. After all those drinks and 2 stepping with a room full of people, the cold air felt so good on your skin. I'll definitely return here soon.

Absolutely loved this restaurant. Your immediately greeted when you walk in, the service is friendly, the food is delicious and the price is just right.  I ordered the pizza rustica, their version of the vegetarian. It tasted as good as it looked. The caramelized onions along with the mushrooms , goat cheese and mushrooms all on a thin crust, just melt in your mouth. My love order the calzone. A little odd since it literally was just pizza folded over with sauce on the side and not what you would think a calzone would be. But nonetheless, he finished his entire meal, as did I. I highly recommend this place. I am a pizza lover who has tried a lot of pizza spots in Arizona and trust me when I tell you, you will not be disappointed. We are definitely coming back to this one.

This place smelled like a urinal! The service was unwelcoming and unfriendly. There are no longer $5 martini's or $5 manicures on Monday. If it wasn't  the horrible over priced pineapple wine, or the unprofessional staff that pushed me out the door before getting a 3rd sip in, it was definitely the horrible stench! The outside of the bathroom smelt worse then the inside of the bathroom. WTF? They should allow smokers to puff inside to kill that smell! Don't waste your time here. It's over priced cocktails with sad service.  I wish some one would have warned me.

Nothing but the best (unless its affordable and wallet friendly) gas for my Berry (VW). The locations are never really in the best of neighborhoods & the odds are pretty good someone will ask if your interested or know someone who is interested in buying a washer but if you can get away with acting as if your a foreigner who speaks anything but English, no one will really bother you.

Food was authentic and the atmosphere is inviting. Tess is the greatest Filipino pastry chef (even though she didn't have any Pandesol) ! Live music with singing and dancing ensures you'll definitely come back.

The ONLY reason I give this place a star is because they had fried tilapia. This has to be the worst Chinese buffet ever. Not only was the food bland and not at correct temperatures (cold fries, really?!), there weren't any labels to let you know what you were looking at. MY GUESS IS AS GOOD AS YOURS game got real old, real quick. The presentation (i.e. personal rice cooker) gave me the impression they didn't even try. And the over all cleanliness was just plain pathetic. Their bathrooms are disgusting. How much rust are you really going to allow to sit there till it's taken care of? The trash in the woman's bathroom was well over filled and the stench was beginning to take on a life of it's own. The staff was.... present. I highly recommend this place to people who have never eaten at a good Chinese restaurant so that way they have no expectations and won't be disappointed. Everyone else, take my advise and look the other way.

I wish they offered something for the pescetarians (why do they no longer offer milk fish?) but my little meat eating family loves this place. My love can't stop eating the bugers and my teenager loves the chicken strips with mashed potatoes and gravy. I do love their french fries. I can't get enough of them. Only when their freshly made though. After sitting out for 20 mins, I'd much rather starve.

The staff was helpful giving me details of their seafood on how its prepared and made from scratch all while sampling about 6 different varieties of ahi. I left with 1/2 lb of shrimp poke kim chee style, shoyu poke and spicy ahi poke for less then $15. I couldn't of been happier! Don't forget to check out their poke bowls.

I been wanting to check out a foot massage place for a while now. After feeling a knot in my right foot I ventured on Yelp and came across this fabulous place. For $50 I got a 75 minute foot massage. And it was HEAVENLY. Those little 4'9, 90 lb adorable Asian woman are incredibly strong.  Your seated in a separate area from the front door after whispering your order to the man who quickly greets you. These over sized recliners are very comfortable. The masseuse gets a bucket of hot water that you soak your feet in while she starts at the top of your head. She then moves on to your neck, ears, face, shoulders, hands and ends @ your finger tips. It is completely divine. You literally have to fight yourself from falling asleep, and that's before she even starts on your feet.  I have no other place to compare this to since it was my first time having a professional foot massage. But I think I'm afraid to go else where for fear of disappointment. My masseuse literally spent an hour straight on massaging my feet. Unfortunately my aching arch never really went away and now I'm forced to seek a foot doctor. I highly recommend this place & look so forward to coming back.

Service here isn't spectacular but the coffee is nothing short of amazing. It is delicious and mouthwatering. 99 cents for a medium iced coffee only makes my addiction stronger. Plus you fill out a online survey and you score a donut on your next visit. Which usually puts a smile on the faces of the less fortunate when I hand them one.

The 2 times I went here were both late around 10P on a Saturday. I've had their tasty and delightful margarita pizza with a sweet white wine. Maybe because I was tipsy off the wine and that's why I felt the pizza and service was excellent? I may never really know.

I like this Starbucks since parking (which rarely ever full) is located just 20 feet from the front door. I've been lucky enough to experience their server fail a couple times and walked out with free drinks. If it's not for the large framed, frumpy, unfriendliest dark male Barista who works afternoons, I might give this spot 5 stars. He makes going there unwelcoming.

The food wasn't nearly as impressive as the decor, glad the service made up for it. The pineapple wine was delicious.

Location was easy to find, just off the freeway. The hotel is surrounded by a large indoor mall along with a few outdoor mini malls all within walking distance. You could find all different type of food choices available in just a small area. The beds were comfy and the rooms were large enough to not feel so squished with 3 teens. Breakfast consisted of a waffle station, many cereal and fruit selections, a step up from your normal continental breakfast. I definitely would stay here again.

Service was surprisingly faster then the last couple reviews. Maybe because there was only one other party dining in also? Service wasn't as friendly, why act like smiling hurts? I ordered the eggs benedict served with hash browns. Nothing to brag about. Don't think it was worth the $8.99 price. The hash browns were good, especially served with onions. The hollandaise sauce isnt as "rich" as they advertised. My daughter had the classic French toast. That wasn't worth  $8 either. The scrambled eggs and bacon that came with it was good and tasty but the french toast was so bland and tasteless, my daughter wouldn't touch it. All in all, the $18.90 bill wasn't worth the $5 tasting food..... I give 2 stars for fast service.

Great, friendly and fast service. It could just be we lucked out and only had one other party there dining in but nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this place. There is an all you can eat for $25 with a 2 dish max per order. After being satisfied off 2 rolls (1 shrimp tempura roll and 1 Tiger roll) I was glad I didn't get the all you can eat :). My daughter had 2 miso soups and a Cali roll. Total was only $27.51, not too bad. I definitely recommend this place.

This has been our favorite kick back, late night dining spot on a Saturday night for the last month and half. Although we have yet to have the same waiter twice, the food and service have been 100% consistent. We love the old school hip-hop songs that play as we catch the latest sports news on the flat screen. My veggie sandwich has tasty roasted seasonal veggies, a bunch of onions & roasted garlic goat cheese on focaccia bread. And it has yet to disappoint. It also pairs nicely with their sweet reisling.

Damn you perfectly delicious, mouthwatering wallet friendly chile relleno burro. I can never have enough of you!! Service is definitely friendlier & quicker at this location then the one off of 16th St/ McDowell.

Tia was sweet enough to accept my expired Groupon. She & her sister own a little studio up (?) town that may be a little confusing to get to even if your using Google maps. I arrived promptly on time for my mani and pedi. I enjoyed every minute of those 2 hours. Tia is warm, attentive and professional. Very easy to talk to. She gives excellent massages as well during your session. Tia has been in the nail business for over 20 years and it really does show in her work. If this studio was closer to home, I would definitely make this my regular spot. I highly recommend going just for the more personal one on one experience. Very few salons such as this exist in the valley.

The waitress was so sweet, super friendly and as accurate as she could get. I ordered the veggie burger and my daughter the bacon cheese burger. Both were cooked to perfection. The fries are bottomless, can't beat that! The onion rings were delicious, especially when smothered in their ranch dressing. The vegetables were crisp and ripe and the buns were perfectly soft. Our drinks were always filled and service was fast.   Our waitress was a total sweetheart. She noticed my daughters Keropi watch from McDonalds and told us of how many her daughter had collected. We told her we had just visited 3 different McDonald's locations  in search of that Hello Kitty watch and we had no luck. She immediately went to the back room and came back with an unopened Hello Kitty watch and offered it to us!!! I was amazed. I hugged and thanked her. She reminded me that there still are giving people in the world!!!

Wish there was a negative star I could rate this pathetic sorry excuse of a burger joint who i still 6 months later, should have given me my money back. I wish I could at least say the service was good, even fair. But sadly no. First they mess up my order by forgetting some toppings I paid extra for. Then I had to ask them for my fries. And that's after a 15 minute wait. And all without so much as an apology. I beg you to not WASTE your money or time in this highly disappointing burger spot

I love getting their $5 off $20 coupon in the mail. Everytime I come here I spend at least that much on their specials, fresh fruit or premade meals. And if you forget your $5 off coupon, a friendly face worker will gladly give you one.

Service was as excellent as it could get. Ahi Katsu special was as good as it sounds. My daughter had the kalbi ribs that they cooked to her preference and even cut into little pieces which saved me about 20 mins. The  Mac salad has potatoes in it, nice touch. The fries were salty but delicious. Definitely headed back to try the garlic shrimp.

My Living Social voucher ( 2 hours free for up to 5 people including shoes, plus 2 orders of nachos and 1 pitcher of soda) led me to this great bowling alley with reasonable prices and unbeatable bowling alley food (MEXICAN).

Tricia got me in with a 2 day expired Living Social voucher & honored it. How can I not love this place?! The decor was chic, the staff was friendly, experienced & welcoming. I can't imagine enjoying another pedi without my cocktail and Violet Femmes rockin' in the back ground. This place is a gem!

Ambeiance is appealing, service is friendly & attentive. Hawaiian punch is to die for! I highly recommend the fish taco's, very filling. The ONLY negative is the hours, only open till 9 week days and 10 fri & sat.

I LOVE spicy ahi poke bowls. And this place came "fairly" close to the ono bowls from Poke Express. For around the same price, about $10. The bland presentation was made up for with taste. I liked how they added a couple of taro chips to the meal, very cute/ different.  I ordered 2 custard malasadas, 2 chocolate malasadas & 2 haupia malasadas all for $7. The custard & chocolate were ono. It wasn't too sweet & the filling was just perfect to where it doesn't squirt out the sides of your mouth when taking your first initial bite. The haupia on the other hand was not what I expected. It was OVERLY sweet & did not go well with the breading. I unfortunately threw both away after the first taste. At least I know now what they all taste like and I will definitely be back for more. The reviews were right, it's as close as you'll get to Leonard's in Vegas. I highly recommend it.

If this had been my first Brazilian experience instead of my 2nd, I wouldn't have been so scared. I was definitely more comfortable this time around, especially after knowing the type of wax that's used. It's warm wax that molds it's self to all the little nooks and crannies and can be taken off with ease without the use of strips. It is a HUGE plus! With in 20 mins my pitts and bikini area was hair free. There's a great deal going on that can't be passed up, buy 3 waxes & get 1 free for $120. You pay the first time you use this deal and she will keep tally of your visits. I highly recommend this place.

The decor was very modern, clean & simple. The bathroom is located behind a sliding door in the side dining area, very sleek. I assumed because I walked in just 90 seconds after opening on a Saturday morning that that's why the staff didn't seem as friendly. The awkward stare between the cashier and waitress as I walk in and make eye contact with both of them while they wait for the other to acknowledge my presence is always bad business. I don't feel I should have been the one to choose between the 2 & ask them how they're doing. But I went ahead & ordered half a dozen of their Portuguese donuts as a makeshift birthday cake for my better half's birthday. Judging by the pictures on Yelp, I knew they were far from authentic, which I was totally ok with. What I didn't know was that it would be anything but tasty. Completely disappointing and flavorless to be exact. I feel like this place has more to offer so I think I would make it back, eventually. For now, The Main Ingredient has my heart. :)

The guys here are professional friendly & attentive. Been coming here for a couple of years and the service has always been steady. Wifi is a plus and so is the clean bathrooms.  I definitely recommend this place. 09/06 Jason was such a sweetheart! I went in for my usual LOF and tire rotation but also wanted him to look in to my AC that was intermittently blowing warm at operating temp. He immediately asked me if I had any coupons and even said he would accept it on my mobile. Unfortunately I couldn't find any. He automatically waved my $30 AC inspection fee and I walked out only paying $46 for my full synthetic oil change and tire rotation. Yay me!

No breakfast comes close to filling up my boyfriend then Vovomeena's BMOC. At around $10, how can one go wrong? A waffle, pork chop, 2 eggs, little cinnamon with apples and a Portuguese donut to top it all off. He can't wait to go back for seconds on Sunday. Order was called in and ready within mins. Workers were friendly and courteous, definitely a plus especially for such a busy place.

In love with the veggie sandwich on 9 grain wheat. The layer of provolone, lettuce tomatoes, (extra onions), cucumbers and avocado spread deliciously hits the spot time and time again. If there's less then 3 people ahead of me, I'm usually in and out within 5 mins max.

My thoughtful other half ordered me a guava cake that was shaped in to little sushi's on a round, pink 6' cake sitting on a sushi roller matt. It came complete with a happy birthday note written on chopsticks.  It was the MOST ADORABLE & ONO cake I have ever tasted in the mainland, hands down. The guava was light and fresh. I'm amazed at the details and all the love that was put in to making this cake so special. I would not hesitate to order from this place myself especially knowing she delivers to down town Phoenix.

Buddah bless the Chinese and their incredibly strong hands.  I was greeted immediately upon opening the door and seated within a minute. I've been to 3 different foot reflexology places and this is by far the best one. The pressure was consistent thru my entire 30 minute massage. What I appreciated the most was they went straight from soaking my feet for a few mins to massaging them, huge plus for me.  Other places I've visited will massage your head, neck, arms and even your back before getting to your feet. Thankfully not this place. Before I knew it, my 30 mins went by way too quick. For $20 though, how can I not come back? I just wish it was closer to home so this could be my weekly fix.

I fell in love with the place when it was 2 Hippies Breakfast Joint and still love it here since the food or great service hasn't changed. Six dollar breakfast burrito will always hit the spot. The décor is different though, no more hippie memorabilia but that's ok, still plenty to look at.

Being greeted immediately after stepping foot in to the store by smiling and welcoming faces is always a plus. I used a Groupon that I could not pass up on this 4 week old establishment. $98 value that features 2 spa pedi's & 2 eye brow waxes for $40 was nearly impossible to pass up. I highly recommend this new spot! They're clean, affordable, friendly & attentive, how could you say no?

I was so excited to try this place out after the Dbacks game on Tuesday after reading all the positive reviews. We walked in around 9P and a friendly face greeted us before even stepping foot in the outdoor dining area. I tasted the carrot cake, cookies & cream & they were soo delicious! The flavors were just bursting in your mouth! I ordered a scoop of each and could not wait to go outside and enjoy it on the picnic tables. I was raving about this place as soon as I sat down. From the adorable décor to the friendly service, the mouthwatering ice cream and the adorable little Chinese take out box it comes in topped with a fortune cookie. And then BAM(!!!!) half way thru my cookies and cream scoop..... a piece of hair. I was literally off that chair & in my car in 5 seconds. I was DISGUSTED. I have to admit, I'm definitely more sad and disappointed knowing I'll never come back here.

Mahalo Daren C. For the awesome recommendation! Without you I would have never found this killer spot. And yes, I was sure to mention your name to the lovely owners. ;)  The food was fresh & ONO. The service was personable, interior was clean and the prices were decent. Every single bite of my garlic shrimp, egg rolls, shrimp katsu & chocolate mousse pie was worth the 24 mile drive over (in traffic too). I can not wait to go back.

Walked out w/ a $14 bottle of balsamic vinegar & could not be happier. Should have brought in my own pretty bottle so I could avoid paying $2 for their cheapest bottle but that's ok. I enjoyed tasting a lot of different flavors I probably wouldn't have else where. Also learned a lot about vinegar. I'll definitely come back with my empty bottle.

I give them two stars because 1, the hostess was nice & 2, the decor was refreshing...  Our waiter could have been friendly enough to deserve a bigger tip but at least he was attentive enough to refill our drinks a few times.   For starters we ordered the $7 calamari fries. It was DELICIOUS. The pieces were thick and the batter was light enough. It came with a side of yummy aioli sauce & marinara, which I thought was a little odd.  I ordered the shrimp Po boy. It was disappointing. Three medium deep-fried shrimp with the tail still on, in between large pieces of white bread. Lettuce, onion & tomatoes came on the side. The tartar sauce was bland. The seasonless fries was the only good part of the dish.   My other half ordered the fish and chips. It came with two medium size pieces of deep-fried cod and french fries. All you taste is the oil. That too was very disappointing.  If my commute wasn't  30 minutes away from Phoenix I would check out the happy hour since they do offer one dollar cod and tilapia tacos.
