An awesome little Italina deli, I would recommend the Il Purista sandwhich. . the prosciuto is so good! This is not a fast place so don't expect your order to come flying out at you but its worth the wait in my opinion.   Also has a good little selection of olive oils, olives, breads, and other goods available

I've gone here twice now and I can say this place is pretty awesome for a quick sandwich, especially compared to those chains like Subway that can get extremely old after awhile. Dilly's is reasonably priced and has fresh bread as well as Boar's Head brand meats which are always bomb!

I love this place! I found it on Yelp when I was looking for a cheap sushi place in Scottsdale and was very pleasantly surprised. I've been a few times now and I have always gotten a ton of food and came out with money still in my pocket. A great alternative to the other places in Scottsdale that try to be chic and hip so they can justify charging you an arm and a leg for two rolls.   Only one complaint: Last time I went to Dozo they were really crowded and it seemed like they only had one server trying to work the entire restaraunt. My girlfriend and I had horrible service and a simple meal (about 4-5 dishes) turned into an hour+ ordeal where we constantly had to ask for things by flagging down staff members. I will be returning, but I hope to get better service next time!

Typically I would have written a great review for this place. On Saturday night however I was extremely disappointed. I've been to Mabel's almost every weekend for the past few months and it was not until this weekend that I was let down.  A group of friends and I were excited to enter as we love the ambiance, decor, drinks, and general crowd at Mabel's. It all went bad when we came up to the doorman and all proceeded to take out our ID's. He completely ignored us and I watched as a crowd of about 20 Affliction-wearing 50 year old's walked out and left with what looked like hookers. I had to tap on the doorman's back to get his attention and he turned to me and said "Can I help you with something?" We were all taken aback by his brashness but said that we were just interested in coming in. He then told us that Mabel's just started a policy on Fri and Sat nights of members and VIP's only. We were turned away and all left with a very bad taste in our mouths.  With so many different bars, clubs and lounges in the area you would think that this establishment would be smarter than that. We would have spent a good amount of $ there but instead were told we couldn't even get in because we were not 'members.' Total bull. I loved the place up until this encounter and won't be going back any time soon.
