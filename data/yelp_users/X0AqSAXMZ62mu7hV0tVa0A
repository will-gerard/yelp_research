Reviews of my adventure in Texas were queuing up for a spare moment.  And before a moment can be spared, I am now hanging in Scottsdale, AZ.  Sadly, I didn't not have a chance to say farewell to such friendly Texan yelpers... with one awesome Elite in mind: Melody L! Thanks for everything Mel!!  And now for the review.  This market is fantastic!  The smell?  It wouldn't be an Asian market without it.  It's a relatively clean market and so well organized -- in sections of nationalities for the most part.  You can almost find everything ethnic here and then some.  My first, and only visit thus far, took me about 2+hrs.  I browsed, studied, absorbed and of course, PURCHASED.  I got my Asian necessities, plus packets of goodies to make hush pups, fried catfish, collard greens and the such -- to show you their range of merchandise. (and yes, I miss Big D!)  I haven't discovered an "Asian community" and there might not be an accommodating one here.  I asked a Vietnamese cashier for recommendations, but I got the feeling she was trying to tell me not to bother.  With this market, I might have to commune in the comfort of my own home.  Asian cooking anyone?

It's definitely my hood's "sports cafe" (family members of all ages are welcome).  I come here on a weekly basis -- mostly to sit at the bar and mainly to satisfy my cravings for their wings. Yep - I ain't afraid of no fried chickin'. As a matter of fact, I'm no stranger to all things fried. "Eat'em up YUM!"  Their bleu cheese chips, buffalo chicken foccacia and tenderloin sandwich are also good. I don't venture too far from my main staples. I did try their ribs and chicken combo once and it was pretty good but I'm not fond of their pizzas. Stick to the bar food and you'll be just dandy. If you're a smoker, there's the back patio area with picnic tables and a TV screen or step out doors if you're upstairs. You'll find families with kids and grandparents hanging out around meal time, which is comforting, but also of which is why I mainly sit at the bar (hehehe - no offense please). My all time reason for coming here for the weekly wings? It's like taking my lil scooter around the block and tahdah, I'm there!

I'm torn! I should give this place 1* but gonna give it 2 instead. The first time I ate here was for lunch. I had one of their lunch specials - shrimp in lobster sauce or something like that and the BF ordered crispy chicken without whatever sauce they slather over it. All was mediocre. The servers were nice & friendly and the space was clean. I really wanted to like this place. It was close to home and finding a conveniently good chinese place is a heaven sent. Not too long ago I got sick. I was craving for a nice bowl of Wor WonTon soup. I called in the order for two people (not for the BF but thinking of the next day -- so selfish!). The BF picked it up on his way back from the gym. I was extremely excited to dive in this "broth of life".  It was far from bringing me back to life. The broth was flavorless! I could do hellah better with packaged ramen!! There were... hmmm... let's see... all of two wontons in the whole soup. Glad the order was for two: 1 wonton for today, 1 for tomorrow! Also, I swirled my spoon 'round'n'round and  around again looking for some crustaceous morsels. I thought out loud to the BF that shrimp should come in the soup. For 9 buckaroos, he said it better comes in a school of 'em. (does "school" applies only to fish?) Anyhow, they did their math correctly though - there's 1 shrimp to go with the 1 wonton for today and the other shrimp to go with the wonton tomorrow. BTW, I'm a queen of doctorin'up flavorless dishes, but this bowl of soup was a loss cause. I'm still trying to recover from my flu. Go figure!
