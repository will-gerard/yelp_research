Came for the Phoenix comicon. The line was ridiculous. It wrapped around the entire building, but at least it did go pretty fast. The place was crowded and very hectic. The kids had a ball, except for the waiting in line part. Other than the long line in the hot Arizona sun, this was a good family outing, we are split on whether we will do this again next year, but I am sure when the time comes, we will all do it again.

We came here for my wife's birthday and we had a BALL. For a measly $10 you can have over two hours of Midnight Bingo fun. That is literally all you need to spend for hours of fun. Granted the marker is another dollar but if you save it and bring it back the next week that's one dollar less you have to spend. The big bonus is that all the snacks are dirt cheap, the soft drinks are free, and you can smoke INDOORS! Even if you are just a social smoker or don't smoke at all, just the fact that you can if you want to is amazing to me. The last time I was able to smoke indoors was in the Frankfurt airport in Germany 4 years ago. Oh yeah if it's your birthday they call you up and give you a chance to win money and prizes, so don't be shy about it. It was really the cheapest and most fun I've had in a long time (insert Atlantic City prostitute joke here). Go go go you won't regret it, and if you do let me know I'll come with you!

I have been coming here for ages. And I really like their bagels and their California chicken sandwich. But one thing I cannot forgive is inconsistency. Sometimes the chicken will be over cooked or under cooked, or the avocado will be black or they won't have the right bread... If I could depend on them to give me the same sandwich every time I came in, I would be there every week. You can't win em all.

I was mortified when I saw the person who's running the front counter smoking right in front of the entrance and surrounded by three little kids ranging from 2 years old to 5 years old. I was disgusted by the fact that she would subject her children to that poison, but was more upset by the fact that I had to walk past her with my own children to get inside. If not for necessity and lack of laundry facilities I would have gone elsewhere. I will never come back to this place again. I hope the laundry owner reads this and retrains their employer. And I hope she reads this and had second thoughts about the choices she is making and the danger she is subjecting her kids to and her customers kids to.

Very good food and awesome friendly service. The place is on the pricey side but you are paying for the quality and for the ambiance, this is a very decedent place full of beautiful people. I will definitely be back as soon as I can find another family member to pay for my meal lol.

Great pizza, great wings, great fries, great lunch specials, but best of all are their Chicago dogs. They are the next best thing to the kind you get in Chicago. I've been through the Chicago airport I've had good Chicago dogs, these aren't them but pretty darn close. Can't really find anything to complain about other than the fact that they do not have orange soda and no military discount. In this day and age and with so many young soldiers running around West Arizona, and with Luke AFB just down the road you'd think the military discount would be a given. But I can't hate, not every business can spare the expense, but when you do come across it, it is a nice little thank you to those who deserve it most. Otherwise, good job Fuzzy's, keep up the good work.   And if it does ever become financially feasible you might want to consider a 10% break for the troops, I'm just sayin'.

Not what it used to be I am sad to say. It seems that all good things do come to an end. The $2 charge for any card transactions do not help. The bad over priced tacos, the horrible seafood place across the street and the fact that's it on "Van Burden" is enough to keep me away for a long time to come.

This place was so crowded and so loud I don't see how anybody could have a relaxing night out. Maybe I'm getting too old for this but I'd rather spend a nice night out with friends in a place where I can actually hear what they are saying. I got the suicide wings and fried mushrooms. The ranch was amazing as usual, the mushrooms were good but a very small portion for the price. The suicide wings were good but true to their name, I was only able to eat three. I think I'll get the hot next time so I can actually eat the wings without feeling miserable. Good food, kinda pricey, great ranch, a little too dark and loud for my taste. Oh yeah and I've never been to a wing place with a Chinese name blasting mexican Cumbia music before, again not for me but but with as many people as they had there it is obviously for someone.

Worst service EVER! I let them know that they had overcharged me on one of my pizzas, instead of acknowledging the mistake and refunding me back the money they overcharged, the manager "Victor" proceeded to argue with me, he finally said "I'll just give you a dollar back to get you out of here" to get me out of here? I am a professional adult who pays taxes and votes, I'm not a homeless person who is trying to scam A business out of something, to get me out of here? I have never been treated this awfully. I was almost embarrassed for the manager, at how foolish he was acting. I felt bad for the owners of this Arizona staple. The "World Famous" Long Wong's pizza and wings should know what a terrible manager they have working for them. If I were you "victor" I might stop wearing polos with my name on them, or at least be embarrassed at the way you treated a long time patron today.

Good drive through with fast service. They haven't gotten my order wrong yet so far so good. They're corn dogs are good. Beware if you order the Chicago dog, they sometimes forget an ingredient and that jus ruins the hot dog.

On this particular night we were jonesing for some "good" Chinese dinner. This was the closest Chinese restaurant to our particular location, I should have kept looking. Take out dinner for four cost $60... $60! We got a subpar cashew chicken, two soggy orange chickens and overcooked shrimp in lobster sauce. Not only was the food not good and overpriced but they also forgot our rice. I have had very good Chinese food for a lot less money, I guess I'll just have too keep searching. I know some have had a good experience at this Chinese food restaurant and I am happy for them, I can only speak for my own personal experience. I don't know if I'll completely write this place off just yet since I haven't tried my old fall back, Kung pow shrimp. But I'll tell you this, give me a bad Kung pow shrimp and you are dead to me!

This place is not bad, at least it is way better than Federico's and to a certain extent filibertos. The chorizo burrito is great just has a little too much tortilla for the amount of filling you get. The chile relleno plate was also pretty good, you get one more chile relleno than I am used to getting in texas. The only problem was that the plate was covered in lettus, so much lettus I had a hard time finding the chiles. I was also not happy with the prices, a little high for a fast food mexican place, it might just be the Arizona economy changed since the 5 years I've been gone. Other than that, it's a pretty good little mexican place plus it's only half a mile from my home so I got that going for me.

Great breads and very friendly service. The only negatives is their parking lot is too small, they don't take credit cards and there are always homeless people begging for money by the door. I am hip to the homeless problem in Phoenix and I give every chance I get but it really upsets me when I see someone just standing by the door waiting for a handout. There is an old man in that very parking lot that goes around cleaning cars windshields and never asks for a dime, everyone tips him even though he leaves the windshields dirtier than when they got there, and they do it because he is trying to work for the money he is given, he is not just standing there waiting for a handout. Kudos to him and I am keeping a $5 bill in my wallet for the next time I see him.

La fama is the epitome of a hole in the wall eatery. It is small and tucked away. With no true parking area in front of the store it is very easy to drive by and never give them a second look. When I moved to Kansas for 5 years I did not expect for this place to still be around when I got back. To my pleasant surprise they are still alive and kicking and still churning out their green chili burritos that have made them famous, well not really famous but somewhat known for. Since I've been back to AZ it's been exactly three days and I've already had two of their burritos. I can't speak much about anything else they sell since I've only really tried the one thing. They do have a small scattered selection of pan Dulce's but nothing like the real mexican bakery a few blocks up the street. But honestly I don't fault them for their lack of selection because I go there for one thing and one thing only. And maybe for one of their Spanish novellas they sell at the counter. They have a great green chili recipe that hasn't seemed to change in the last 5 years since I've been gone. It feels good to be home and it feels good that the tastes I remember haven't changed either. I will be stopping by a lot more often now that I am home to stay.

Very cool place so much to see. I was definitely overwhelmed walking through the isles of this antique shop. After about 45 min i was tired of walking only to find that there's a whole other floor to explore. You can't see it all in one trip so I'll be sure to be back. Got me a Elton John vinyl for $5, good find.

Great fast food place. In all honesty the only thing I like from here are the caramel cheesecake bites, I get my Americanized mexican food from Taco Bell but can only find these delicious snacks here. When I was in Iraq I ate cheesecake bites once every other week and I would count down the days to the next time they'd be available. I am so happy that I am back in the states and I can eat cheesecake bites until I'm sick of them. Friendly workers, fast service and reasonable prices.

Average mcdonalds never done me wrong aside from the occasional mishap or wrong order. I will be honest the review about someone at the drive thru with a gun freaked me out a bit, but so far I haven't been shot so we are good to go.

Overall good experience just wish the vendors weren't so damn pushy. If I wanted to be accosted by random vendors pushing crap I don't need id go to the mall. I was disappointed that they don't renew your membership for free here if you are military like they do in texas, but you do get a $15 gift certificate. Btw when did the membership jump up to almost $50?! I remember when it was a little less than $40, everything is getting so dang expensive now days.

Great shrimp and octopus cocktail, probably one of the best I've ever had. It's a little pricier than most other places for the location, but the food, or at least the cocktails, is worth it. Can't wait to try other dishes on their menu.

Delicious food friendly staff and they have orange Fanta! Love this place, it's a little pricey but it's worth it. I remember back when they used to have a rat and roach problem but it looks like that has been taken care of. I will be coming back here again and again, great place.

The food here is always good and the service is great. It has certainly grown since the last time we were here some six years back. I only wish they had a larger hot sauce selection, all they had was some red sauce in a oil dispenser. The pancakes were big and tasted good, the turkey club was tasty. I didn't like the French fries so I'll make sure to ask for onion rings next time. And the sausage patties were kinda salty. Ultimately, this is a really nice place to come with friends or family.

Fun park with lots of swings and slides. The water play area is fun and a refreshing break from the sun. Unfortunately, depending on the day, it can tend to get very crowded, and this close to an urban city you tend to get people from all walks of life converging in one place, I'm talking about the bad elements. There are nice courteous hard working people that come to the park to have a nice peaceful and respectful time, and then there are the rest, those are the ones you have to worry about.

I used to come here a lot for lunch some 6 years ago, I made my first visit since I've been back in AZ tonight. I gotta say it has really changed, the food is different and not necessarily in a good way, the portions are smaller and the prices are higher. I guess it the unavoidable evolution of things. The meal we had tonight was decent, my shrimp in lobster sauce was more slimy than goopy, and the rice was bland. I must say tho that the waiter was friendly and helpful and the potstickers were delicious. I'd come again, but would order something different next time.

Horrible horrible service. I don't know if it's because it's phoenix or because the crew and management just suck but I had a horrible experience at this chipotles. They tried to load my burrito up with rice and didn't drain the beans making my burrito a soggy mess. But the worst part is that they gave me less meat than the previous two customers so when I pointed it out they guy just said he'd have to charge me for double meat. I said no, I just want the same meat everyone before me got. They either didn't get it or didn't care, either way it's a bad way to do business. I will NEVER go to this chipotles again.

Wow what a decadent place. If you want to go to where all of Arizona's biggest and brightest converge, then this is where you want to be. I felt very underdressed even for a simple brunch out. The food wasn't exorbitantly expensive and was extremely good. The wait was ridiculous but I guess it's to be expected with this places popularity. Oh yeah and free valet! Can't beat that with a stick! I do believe I'll be back soon.

I must say I was not impressed. One surly afternoon I found myself in a rut, nothing seemed to be going right. I decided that I needed some New York Deli (I know, random right?) I pulled out my trusty iPhone and proceeded to search for a Jason's or McCallister's, but to no avail. It just so happened that I was also in need of the services of my local post master, so as I drove to the post office I came across Heidi's New York Style Deli, coincidence? Fate? Happenstance? I proceeded inside. I ordered the hot pastrami on marbled rye and a chefs salad for the Dutches of Surprise (my wife) this is when everything began to unravel. My first clue that I was headed on a path of disappointment was when the pleasant young lady proceeded to place my sandwich in the microwave, pause for dramatic effect... I guess it was my fault for asking for a "hot" pastrami. The next disappointment came when the lady handed me my salad dressing in a pouch, a pouch! Deli? No, New York style? No, Authentic? No, Heidi's? I don't even know anymore :(

The rancho market is such a colorful and friendly place. As soon as you walk past the big security guy at the entrance you are rewarded with wonderful smells, sights and sounds. You need a authentic sombrero with the tassels on it, well that's in isle 6, alligator shoes isle 10, and a Dora piñata fighting a Scooby Doo piñata are All conveniently hung over head. Any food you have ever heard of and more that you can't even spell are all represented in this one stop shop for the mexican house mom. Go on a weekend and take advantage of all the free sample stands that sprinkle the store isles. You might no have to worry about paying for lunch if you make the run a couple times and try and hit each of the offerings. For those less adventurous, you can sit down at the communal tables situated in front of a functioning restaurant. The food smells like heaven, looks extremely appetizing and taste even better than all that. On my last visit I had the tripa (pig intestines) tacos and carne asada tacos, they were small but soft warm and packed with tender goodness. They're like street tacos from a Tijuana taco truck except a little cleaner and a touch pricier. I am always looking for a good deal but a good tasting taco at $1.75 isn't gonna break my bank. My wife had the carnitas plate with rice and beans, he meal was a bit dry but in their defense it is hard to keep carnitas from drying out. Besides that, the carnitas were tasty, the corn tortillas were fresh and soft, the rice was good and the beans came with a crumbly white cheese that added to its authenticity. I also got an order of shrimp ceviche, they give you three tostadas to eat with your ceviche but no plate or fork, so that was a challenge. I really like ceviche, I'm like a raw fish connoisseur if you will. I've had ceviche and sushi all over the states and beyond, so I can safely say that I know the difference between a good raw fish and a bad one, and as much good raw fish as I have had, I have probably had an equal amount of bad. The Rancho Market's shrimp ceviche had good flavor but was dangerously close to being bland. The shrimp had been sitting in the marinade a little too long and came out a bit tough. Getting the right consistency with marinating raw shrimp is a science and one that is hard to perfect. I'll give them an E for effort but unfortunately did not meet my expectations. I can however speak volumes about they Horchata, it was very tasty, not too sweet and not too bland, and thank gob it didn't have that nasty coconut aftertaste most of these mexican restaurants try and force on us. Anyways, great food for the value, large mexican grocery offerings and an overall eclectic colorful place for an enjoyable shopping trip. If you're in the market for a big pancho or mariachi sombrero this is the place you want to be.

Absolutely Terrible bland food. I had the shrimp in lobster sauce and the sauce was brown instead of white like it should be. I will never order from this place again. Really bad food, such a disappointment.

This review is in regard to my experience with the Penske truck rental department at Home Depot. I returned my truck 12 hours late on the due date and the friendly person at the counter did not charge me the $100 late fee I was warned I would have to pay. I tried to clean the cab and box as well as I could but did not have time to clean off all the bugs from the grill and windshield, again, he said not to worry about it. My trip took a full day longer than I had planned and I had to rush everything just to get the truck back 12 hours late. If you have ever done a military move you know what a hassle getting weight tickets can be. With all the other headaches I had with this move, the fact that this counter person treated me with respect and helped me out was a welcome change of pace for me. My experience with Home Depot made all the madness from the previous few days almost disappear. I am truest thankful when I run into someone who still believes in good customer service and I will sung heir praises and send my friends their way. Treat your customers right and your customers will be plentiful. I only wish my experience was this good back in texas where I originally rented the moving truck. It was a mom and pop (and son) shop and they weren't the friendliest or most helpful people in the world. (I have their review on here somewhere). Thanks HD, Penske and that counter person who was awesome (might have been Mike).

The owners are so cool. They always have good recommendations and are very knowledgable when it comes to the more obscure independent graphic novels. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good reads, old and new. Very kid friendly as well.

Great service and great food. We came for breakfast today but had to leave due to an emergency before our food came out, they were more than happy to bag our stuff quickly so we could be in our way. I really love their lemonade, it is hard to find good lemonade sometimes. My wife loves their pecan pancakes. Only downfall, no military discount, and there tends to be more rude and closeted racist at this restaurant than most, I guess it has a lot to do with the name. Maybe I'll have better luck for lunch, I'm going to Mein Kampf Eatery, should work out great!

I came to the movie theatre to watch 22 Jump Street, the movie was funny and didn't disappoint but the movie theatre was nothing special. The floors were sticky, the nachos were stale and the drink machine was broken. So it was not very different from any other movie house. The movie was funny but I am sure the Dutches of Surprise and I could have found a better way to spend $45 on a weeknight out. The one thing that really did disappoint me was the fact that they did not do a military discount on the tickets. I am not one to ask for a military discount and I hardly ever do, I actually get annoyed when army wives get all uppety when they don't get their military discount (you aren't in the military so shut up) but I am used to getting my military discount at the movies, I guess I am spoiled that way. Anyways, you charge exorbitant prices, you don't clean your theatre, your soda machine is broken and you make billions of dollars but you can't give a hard working army guy 10% off his ticket? It's whatever, but I'm still a little jaded. Say something nice, the soda jerk was nice and pleasant but the guy who sells the tickets was kinda douchey. Oh yeah, go watch 22 Jump Street, it's as funny as the first one.

Really good food, nice little restaurant with a comfortable atmosphere and extremely friendly workers. I must admit I was a little disappointed with the shrimp in lobster sauce I had. I had to ask if it was white sauce as it should be or a weird brown sauce like some regions of China use. Unfortunately it WAS the brown sauce. I was told they could do the white sauce so I was happy about that, that is until I dug in and found a watery bland "juice" where my thick viscous lobster sauce should have been. Everything about my dish was delicious except the sauce, I was torn, the sauce is the key to the entire dish. Unfortunately I will not be able to order that dish again, my FAVORITE dish, sigh. Today I try the Kung pow shrimp, hope I am not disappointed again...

What an absolutely awesome place. The food here is delicious, and I simply cannot get enough of their cheese calzone. I will be back again and again and again.  The restaurant is kind of small and can get really crowded, but the food is absolutely worth it. Great for families, dates, kids. We really love it.

Good cents is good so I'm usually happy with my order, however I have had a few instances where they either forgot the mayo, or they used spicy ranch instead of spicy mustard, I am sure I do not have to tell you how this can change the entire flavor of your sandwich. I still like the place, I've just learned to not order ahead, and definitely never order delivery, I'd rather have eyes on my sandwich throughout the entire process.

After my big move from Texas to Arizona my first order of business was looking for a good mexican place. Although this place looks like a mexican restaurant gone corporate, I gave it a try and I was not disappointed. So far I have tried the rolled tacos with shredded beef and I've tried the mexican torta. The rolled tacos came with fresh avocados, something you don't readily see at a fast food mexican joint. The green sauce and side of red sauce were the perfect companion. They also coat the tacos in sour cream and crumbly white cheese which made them all that much better. The torta was equally good but a little too nice and neat for me, I am used to a well designed mess in a bun. The Horchata was also good, not too sweet and not too watered down. The only complaint I have is that it's a little pricier than most fast food mexican joints like filibertos and the like, but I can't complain too much because the food was well made and well worth the price. I venture to say that this might just well become my regular mexican place, sorry Humbertos.

We had so much fun here this Spring Training season. I have been here every year since I moved back to Arizona, and plan on making it a father son tradition for years to come. It was pretty neat walking around the ball park and seeing all the clothing and faces and hairstyles I remember growing up in Highland Park. It was like being back in Southern California for a couple hours. I visited almost every spring training field in Arizona and this is one of my top favorites. It's not the newest or fanciest, but you cannot get that SoCal flavor or a dodger dog anywhere else in AZ. Go Dodgers!

I have been here three times. We had a regular breakfast place back in tx and thought this might become our regular breakfast place here in AZ. Everything went fine the first couple times we ate here, good food, good specials, clean restaurant, and friendly staff. But on our last visit, after the meal I asked my waitress why my $5.59 breakfast special came out to over $8. The waitress bluntly told me it's because you had onions on your potatoes, I asked if they normally charge $2.50 for onions? And she told me yes in a very offended tone. After that short exchange her whole demeanor changed, she ignored us the rest of the time we were there and took over 30 minutes after we finished our meal to take my card to pay the bill, finally I had to just take the bill up to the counter myself and pay. I am the last person to give a business a less than favorable review because of one bitter employee, but I kid you not, when we went up to the counter every employee we saw and passed looked at us like we just shot the president. The lady at the counter never looked at me and when she finally did take my card she snatched it out of my hand and threw it back on the counter at me after she charged it, she threw the card back... My mouth dropped, I have never experienced that before, and over something as petty as me asking about the price of onions? I know you probably think I'm the douche who nit picks everything and makes every waitresses life a living hell, but I am the complete opposite. I tip very well and am nothing but friendly and courteous, but I am also going to be the first to call you out if you provide shitty service. I still left her a 20% tip.

This is a really nice installation. I have been to several Army Post, and although Luke does not compare to many of those, it is quaint, relatively clean and the airman are nice. One big thing I've noticed that carries from every military installation is how rude the AAFES employees are. I believe I have complained about them before. I will say that the workers here are the nicest of the lot, although that is not saying much, it does matter and does make a difference in your overall experience. I came today for a medical appointment and the medical staff are always friendly and caring. I think they see an old Army soldier and know they can be a little less soft since they know we can take more. That came out wrong. Army guys are salty, mean and rough, and communicate in grunts and HOOAH's, where airman are more PC I guess, feel free to let me know if I'm completely off base on this one. Anyway, I like Luke AFB I would not have minded living here when I was in.

This is a very nice Kohls. It is clean and has lots of selection. It's nice that it is right behind my house and the fact that it is a stand alone store in a random neighborhood, keeps the bad elements out. I know this store chain isn't really known for its ghetto people such as a Walmart might, but even the Kohls in bell road just a few minutes away is a bit more ghetto than this one is. Plus the parking lot is a great place for driving practice for new drivers.

Very upset with this place. I called the phone number and went to their website before I made the drive and in both places they say they open at 8 am, show up and find out they don't open til 9. I really don't appreciate having to wait an hour after having done my due diligence.

Six years ago Filibertos were springing up everywhere. They were monopolizing the fast food mexican trade and putting all the polibertos, rolibertos, and Humberto's out of business, or at least that was the game plan. Today I am back in AZ and am saddened to see how much of a big player filibertos has become. With their streamlined business model, professionally designed identity and logo, and their official website, they have turned a personal relationship between taqueria and taco eaters into a perverted faceless business venture. Give me back my taco truck on the side of the road, not this futuristic look into the big taco machine. All conspiracy aside, the experience true taco lovers were accustomed to is all but dead, the flavors have become bland and the exchange is no different than driving Through a jack in the box or del taco. Socorro and Conchita are no longer hanging out the drive through window yelling at you in Spanish, the cook isn't also the owners cousin and landscaper on the weekends. But worst of all the Horchata is watered down. There are a few things I can look the other way for, but watered down Horchata is just not one of them. People, just because a restaurant looks new and clean and their drive through speakers work doesn't mean they are up to par. What are you willing to sacrifice for a uniform big box feel and convenience? You aren't getting lower prices, you are only getting lowered standards when it comes to taste. I don't need my drive through lady to speak perfect English and I don't need for the cook to wear a shirt when he's frying the meat, what I do need is true authentic flavor, nothing can ever come before that.

Cool staff, very clean and well run. I've had a good experience anytime I've been here so no complaints from me. Just wish they carried liquor. On the other hand, no worried cuz I can just go to Luke AFB and get all the liquor I want, tax free and 24 hours a day!

Ok this is a tough one. I want to be so mad at Caminero for not having the green avocado salsa I love, but their burritos are so good, I am torn. I was pretty upset, I mean the burritos are the only reason I come here, the decor is gaudy and the tables are small, and from where I live, this is quite a track for me. But I continue to come, because of the green avocado salsa. And when they don't have it HULK GETS MAAAAAD! Ok so back to the burrito, the meat is sooo good, it is grilled and has a bit of a char that makes it oh so good. Compared to a filibertos where the meat is a bit soggier and bland. I really like this place, and when I moved back to Arizona, it was one of the first places I visited. I think from now on I'll call ahead and ask if they have the green avocado salsa before I make the hike over.

Very friendly drive through worker and counter person, they got my order eighth the first time. It is very clean and bright. Always a good cup of coffee even though it's a little more expensive than I would like, but what are you gonna do.

This place was pretty nice, it was clean, well that is before a kid threw up on the floor. I think I would have liked a separate room for the contagious kids, but I digress. The staff was nice, our visit was short, but I'm not sure if we actually got our money's worth or not. The dr came in, looked at our sons bug bite and sent us away with a recommendation of anti itch cream. I guess I should be happy it was not more serious, at least I hope it isn't. I don't like that he just looked at it and automatically had a diagnosis, but at the same time, I'm sure he sees this every day, and he knows what he is talking about. He is the professional and I am not (although he wasn't dressed very professionally) I guess I expect someone that makes $100k plus a year to dress better than I do, but again I digress. I would like to give them 5 stars, the only thing keeping me from that was the shabby dress and hurried nature of our Doctor, other than that, pretty nice place.

Very clean and friendly staff. Try the animal style burger, it had pickles, sauté onions and extra spread. But stay away from the animal fries, for some reason all those toppings work in the burger but not so much on the fried, they were pretty gross.

Went in for my interview today and was just amazed at how huge this campus is. They have security posted at the entrance to the compound and security inside the building, it's almost like a military post. You have to swipe a card to get through the door. They have a Starbucks and a sandwich shop, a cafeteria and a little shop with clothing and other things. The manager told me you can swipe your card at the register at any of the shops and it will directly take it out of your check. They also have a gym, a quiet room, a game room, physical therapist, nurse... It was amazing, really hope I get this job (fingers crossed).

Good service great food. The salsa is a little in the white side (made for white folk). But it's spicy and the chips are good. They have orange Fanta so that's a major plus. I always order the "Machaca" and it is perfect, I only wish they have me more than 2 tortillas. This is a perfect place for lunch or dinner, although I do prefer the original restaurant that's 10 miles south of this one.

Went here with my wife hoping for a nice cool treat, I got the Diablito wich has chamoy, chili, tamarind and lime, my wife got the strawberry and cream. These were absolutely the worst tasting things we have ever tried. Mine was bitter and sour and not at all appetizing. My wife's strawberry and cream tasted rancid like either the cream went bad or the strawberry a did. We had to throw then away after just a few bites, an unfortunate waste of money.

Great tasting burgers. It's really a toss up between this place and Culiver's for a freshly made great tasting burger. I only wish the pastrami was a true pastrami sandwich. I'd take it on rye or sourdough or an onion roll, but not too fond of it on the French roll. Plus it's not as juicy as I'm accustomed to getting from a true deli. Overall a good burger joint.

The shrimp in lobster sauce I had last nights was actually pretty good. The woman who was nearly impossible to understand on the phone called it "shrimp with vegetables IN lobster sauce" it was close enough. It did however have a bit too much broccoli for my taste and the sauce was a bit watery, I'm used to a more viscose lobster sauce. The egg drop soup was also good, but the fact that it had corn in it threw me off a bit. Overall a good experience and I will definitely be back, a little further away that other Chinese places closer to my home, but well worth the drive. My only complaint is that the bottled sodas were $2 and you have to pay .25¢ for chili oil.

Great tasting yogurt and fun toppings. The staff is kind if young and I am sure they'd rather be somewhere else on a Friday night, so I don't blame them for not being the most enthusiastic crew. The prices are somewhat reasonable, and even though it can get pretty busy on the weekends, there is hardly ever a long line, doesn't really take that long to get some yogurt. Also they have a 20% military discount, one of the highest I've seen, so kudos for that!

This place is a cross between a swap meet and a... Well I guess it's just like a mexican swap meet but indoors. They have good food, fruits, drinks, and countless snacks, oh yeah and the seafood is fresh and tasty. The crap the vendors sell is pretty much that, crap, but you wouldn't really expect less from a indoor swap meet, that is literally attached to the most ghetto mall in all of the valley.

Let's start off with the food, it was actually good, like REALLY good. But no matter how good the food is, if the service is garbage, it completely sours the experience. I would have been more than happy to give this place 4 maybe even 5 stars but our experience there completely ruined my lunch, and that is just something I cannot forgive. So what happened exactly, that left me so dissatisfied you ask? I had ordered chicken pad Thai and my wife ordered the yellow curry chicken, this is the same meal we order at every Thai restaurant we've ever been too. After what seemed like a lifetime (30 min) a man brings out our food, my meal was correct but my wife's yellow curry had turned into a red curry. What you have to understand is that even though I love spicy food, my wife cannot stand it. She politely lets the man know that she had ordered yellow curry, honest mistake and one that is easily corrected. This is obviously not what my complaint is, that would make me a jackass. What really caught me by surprise and really upset me was how the man reacted to my wife's polite correction. As soon as she said it, he gave her the ugliest look you will ever see, she was surprised and said, "I did order the yellow curry" he scoffed at her and looked at her like she had just lied to his sainted mother. I was beside myself. Now all this is bad enough, but what added the icing to the cake was when we found out the man was actually the owner of the restaurant. I will never step foot inside this place. No meal is worth being treated like crap. I wish people would understand that you are in the business of customer experiences, no one forced you to get into the business, you did it by choice. And being in the business of customer experiences it is your job, nay, your duty to make your customers feel good when they leave your establishment, not like they were trespassing somewhere where they were not welcomed. I am truly disgusted and saddened by this owners actions towards two nice friendly and loyal patrons. Needless to say, we will never return to this restaurant.

I really enjoy the ceviche from this place they have two laxatives in Phx that I know of, I have been to both and have never been disappointed. I will say this though, the seafood is rather pricy compared to other Mariscos restaurants and the juice in the shrimp cocktail hurts my nasal passages. It might be that I am allergic to something they put in they elixir or I don't really know what it is. Anyways the point is that it is not the traditional shrimp broth most other places use, and it keeps me from buying their shrimp cocktails, and that is a sad because I LOVE shrimp cocktails. Great Mariscos spot, I highly recommend it!

Wow, what a waste of my time and money. First of all the woman who cut my hair had no idea what she was doing, second she did not speak a word of English. She jacked up a simple fade haircut and she spent most of her time talking to her little girl who was running around the shop and talking on her cell phone. After she was done messing up my hair and leaving my beard all crooked and lopsided she took 10 minutes trying to add $25.50 and the .75¢ charge for credit card use, and after all that she still overcharged me by a dollar. If I was a lesser man I wouldn't have tipped her at all, but my nice guy demeaned got the better of me. I will never go to this place again, I could have gotten the same haircut, actually a better hair cut from the Koreans down the road for less than half the price. My hair will grow back but I'll never get my $29.60 back :(

Very fresh and tasty seafood and other mexican plates. On Thursday if you buy a dozen oysters you get another dozen for free! And the oysters are a dozen for $11.50 that is the cheapest price I have found in Arizona so far. It's a little ways away but well worth the drive. Ask about their daily specials.

Came to visit my brother and come to find there are no visits on Saturday, only Sundah and Monday, seems kind of ass backwards to me. The desk person seemed removed and cold, not very knowledgable or professional. The machine where you put money into your inmates account was slow and did not give us any confirmation or receipt to let us know the money even went through, also, there was an almost $8 fee to process the deposit SMH. Fortunately we were able to meet a nice older couple who were having a hard time getting information about their son, I know, it's hard to believe that the desk person could be so useless. We were able to help them get the info they needed by speaking for them and calling the DOC on their behalf to inquire about their son. Not much was accomplished today as far as being able to visit with my brother and I am not too confident that the money will get to him, but at least we were able to help a nice couple find their son in this screwed up system. You'd think with all the funding Arpaio gets, he'd be able to do a better job of treating Arizona residents who find themselves in an unfortunate situation, and their loved ones, better.

What a disappointment this place was. I didn't even finish my bland thrown together burrito. I have some pretty high standards when I comes to burritos and mexican food in general. If you are going to peddle burritos in my neighborhood you better BRING IT!

These tripa tacos are the absolute best tripa tacos I have ever had. I had gotten used to the nasty tripa tacos I used to get in Texas. They were so bad, fried within an inch of their lives and hard as shoe leather. Taco mich has some amazing tripa tacos, and their carne asada tacos are pretty darn good too. Be careful with the red salsa, it is easy too put too much on your tacos and ruin them by making them inedible. The horchata is very tasty as well, none of that overwhelming coconut flavor like at some places.

This restaurant s just so very good. It's kind of pricy, but in my opinion it is well worth it. As I have complained in the past, Arizona has very little to offer in the way of Chinese food. I have traveled far and wide and have had very good Chinese food. I became spoiled, after experiencing what other states have to offer. I used to really like certain places here in the valley, but after leaving the state, I found out what I was missing out on. This place is the closest I've come to decent Chinese food. The staff is really friendly and boy do hey work fast. Now only if their prices were a little lower and they delivered to Surprise, we'd be in business. Keep up the good work Wok Wei (translation: Walk Way) lol

So delicious, so many cool and tasty treats. The prices are cheap and the workers are extremely nice. They are smack dab in the middle of the ghetto so I hope they can avoid becoming ghetto like their surroundings, I've seen too many good businesses go bad fast. Great place I plan on visiting more often.

This was a very fun place. The shrimp in trifecta sauce was very tasty. I must admit I do not getting messy, and this was about the messiest I've been, while eating dinner that I have been in a very long time. So so messy. The shrimp were huge, juicy, sweet, spicy, flavorful. I tried to find something wrong with this place that would prevent me from awarding 5 stars, but honestly I could not. There were a few things that I would have liked to see that would have made this a 6 star experience, I asked them to play the cops America Argentina match on the tv, they said they would, but I guess they got too busy or forgot. They did not know what a Remoulade was, and the hush puppy's were slightly undercooked. Other than that, what a great place! Will most definitely be back.

Ok so found out about this place on Facebook, came and ordered two tacos. Came back the very next day and ordered four tacos. The meat is juicy and flavorful, the toppings are fresh and the salsa is spicy and nice. I had a couple of gristley bits, but I didn't even mind it. The tortillas are freshly made. We tried both the carne Asada and al pastor tacos, and also the cheese quesadilla. Everything is a winner. I feel bad, but I might have to jump ship from Waldo's taco truck... Nah, I'll still eat both. BTW don't make the same mistake I did and try to make a lunch out of this, they do not open until 5:30pm.
