Best Chinese (American style) food that I have had in Phoenix. I live in Tempe, but I find myself driving out here to have some spare ribs, sweet and sour pork, chow mein, and hunan chicken. Such a delight in this desert where Chinese food is... not great. It's a bit of a wait sometimes once you order, but definitely worth the wait.

Dr. Mansfield is amazing. She listens and provides valuable feedback and resources. I just moved t the area, and I was worried about finding a new physician. I'm not worried anymore; in fact, I'm going to stick around even though I've moved to Tempe. Fabulous care.

I went here with my girlfriends on a weekday at lunch time, and we were seated right away. The wine recommendations were excellent, and the food was great. I ordered the tomato and mozzarella as an entree, and it was delicious. My friends ordered a variety of food from salads to sandwiches, and we were all impressed. Great experience!

I ordered an iced pumpkin chai with light ice (I have crazy sensitive teeth, but it's too 100 something degrees out to order hot beverages). My drink was literal perfection. 5 stars, hands down. I declared my new allegiance immediately and made my three compatriots try it on the spot. We were sold; that's is, until the rest of them got their drinks. Yikes. The breve was basically all half and half, the vanilla carmel latte with almind milk was so burnt that it tasted peppery, and the drip coffee was over roasted and was likened to Starbucks. While I tried to convince my sister to return her coffee, she was very adamant about not causing a fuss. (Obviously not the barista's fault. They were so kind, and I'm sure they would have swapped it out.) My sister proceeded to buy an iced pumpkin chai with almond milk to go, given the dream that was my drink. Her drink was so thick. It tasted like straight syrup. I want to love this place. I've been hearing about it for a while, it's close to my house, and it's not a chain. Unfortunately, only one out of five drinks being really good, and only two out of five being drinkable, and the inability to replicate a good drink mere minutes after being served the first by the same barista? I will not be in a hurry to try Goldbar again. I'm really hoping it was just an off day, but it was a big waste of money. Two stars, one for my perfect drink, one for the kind baristas, and negative one star for each drink that ended up in the trash.

If you love hipsters and great coffee, you'll adore Lux.  Bring your latest novel, poetry, or your laptop, throw on your big-rimmed glasses, and order a delicious vegan pastry and a feelin'-fancy coffee, and be one of the cool kids in downtown Phoenix. You'll love the people watching and the food/drinks are great. This is a wonderful date location on a Friday night or a fabulous Saturday afternoon escape with your pals.  Seating can be hard to come by, especially if you're in a group of three or more, but it's worth being a seating shark. Love the pink couches.  The friendly service is great, and surprisingly, the crowd was baby-friendly! We brought my niece in (dressed in her hippest leggings and onesie, naturally), and people stopped to coo at her and tell her what a good baby she was--i.e. smiling and laughing the whole two hours we were there. Hipsters have hearts, too. Who knew?

The food here is disappointing. The lo mein was too salty and the honey walnut shrimp sauce was lacking in both quality and quantity. I give them 2 stars though, because they deliver... it takes an hour though. Not great.

I really enjoyed the patio setting at the Vig. I went for an early dinner, and there weren't too many people there. It's a walk in and seat yourself deal, so there was no wait. I ordered the Mac n Cheese with bacon, and I give it a solid four stars. The portion was huge, the taste was solid, the price was decent, and the ambiance was nice--as expected. I recommend checking this place out. (Not with a baby--you'll get disgusted looks from hipsters and wait staff alike.)

Cartel is a fun little place to go when you have one of the following:  crazy caffeine craving writing on your to do list (you must own headphones) hipster withdrawals a need for a place that serves coffee and beer you want a snarky letter for abusing the one hour parking (Sorry, Cartel)  All told, I really enjoy this spot. I will definitely be back--but I will park down the street...

Great donuts. The best donuts I've found in Arizona so far. Moist, light, fluffy--all at once. Get ready to smell this place from across the street. So yummy!

Salon Renew is an incredible gem in the heart of scottsdale. A two woman operation with phenomenal stylists who can cut and color like no others. I'm new to the area and worried about finding a replacement for my beloved hairdressers there. I'm never looking back! So in love with this place! Do yourself a favor and make an appointment. Happy hairdressing!

My sisters and I went to the intro class this morning, and it was so fun and empowering. The hammocks really helped me to do poses that I haven't been able to do before. The group was super friendly--lots of laughing and shared tentative looks about our first inversions. Okay, inversions? So fun. We can't wait until our next class! Thanks for being awesomely helpful and cool, Elise!

So, The Stand has ruined me -- or at least my reputation at work! I discovered this place a few weeks ago, and the short rib tacos with their sweet pickled cabbage has had me coming back multiple times... per week. Every time I leave my office at lunch, someone says, tacos? Yes, I admit it. I cannot stay away. The sweet and savory combo is deadly (to your diet). The burgers are good, too, and the shakes are just as thick and amazing as the Yelpers say. Definitely five stars.

The grilled Italian cannot be beat. Like seriously. Take a group of people who don't want sandwiches and open one of these bad boys up in front of em.... boom! Suddenly everyone is ordering sandwiches. Like magic.
