They need to change the oil, fries both regular and greek came out brown and well done. Everything was bland. Greek salad tasted like nothing.  Calamari fried in old oil as well. Gyro sandwich was bland too. Beer selection limited. I'm not sure how this place is still running? Service was outstanding but we will never go back.

Seriously the best place I've ever eaten in Phoenix!!! Authentic Jamaican food. Vita Malt, Ting, plantains, reggae music and ridiculous food!!! Amazing service and selection. So so so so so good!
