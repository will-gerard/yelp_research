I had hip replacement surgery on August 25, 2014 and within 2 weeks was walking with a cane and after week 3 was walking fine by myself and actively working.  His office staff is friendly and communicates well.  He is a great surgeon that is proud of his work and is concerned with your health..  I highly recommend this Doctor!

After a visit to this store one Sunday for their "One Day Sunday Specials" I drove a 50 mile round trip for a desktop computer that was a fantastic price.  Not only did they not have it but they NEVER had it.  I asked them to call the store in Tempe...the sales guy I talked to said "if they have it they won't hold it for you"...I said call anyway.  He called and they had ONE and it was the floor model.  I see that I am not the only one on here that has had this experience.  'Scuse me but isn't this FALSE ADVERTISING?"....I know I'm not allowed to pull this stunt in my business so why are they?  ARGH.    I told the sales guy that I was aware of this type of advertising and not only would I never shop there again but I would not even buy a PENCIL on the way out....so buyer beware...call ahead to see if they have it before you go but even if they say they have it don't expect it to be there when you get there!

I have had it with this gym.  I should have known better but I was pressured into buying a training membership at a ridiculous monthly charge which of course they hit your credit card.  In September of this year I attempted to get them to cancel this training membership because of financial difficulties.  I was told they would take care of it and I would be put on hold with my training charges and they would only charge me $15 a month until I could resume.  So of course the next month they hit my card again and I complained.  It took them 2 weeks to credit me back and then within 4 days they charged my card again.  I complained on 11/12/12 and am still waiting for the refund.  On 11/27/12 I called AGAIN and was told he would "call me back" in an hour...of course no call.  Today I called and asked for the gym manager.  We will see what happens but I WILL NEVER AGAIN USE THIS GYM.  This has been a source of frustration and stress for me for 2 months now.  Don't have anything great to say about the training when I was receiving it either...nothing bad just nothing great either.

Ick and double quadruple ick.  Poor customer service, super smoky, poorly laid out, just bad.  Morning we go down to get breakfast there is only one teeny tiny cafe open and their machines were down so we had to pay cash and there was a waiting line no other place is open for breakfast in the whole casino really?  Confused staff like they were just hired confused...wish we had read the other horrid Yelp reviews before we booked.

This place rocks!  When they opened I was skeptical because years ago there was another yogurt place there that failed...They have done a great job of advertising there with specials in the local West Valley View and in the mailer you get with the local stores.  The store is always clean, the personnel is helpful and friendly and yogurt is yum!  I love to see a business do it the right way and applaud their success.  The store is always busy after the dinner hour with people out on the patio and inside and there is a nice vibe there!    Way to go Yogurtini!

I highly recommend this company.  Cristy came out and gave me recommendations on what would work best for my room and I ended up spending less than I thought I would need to.  Was very happy with them!

Really great.  No fancy surroundings, just nice quiet, dark, relaxing music, full body massage.  I was in a knot and could not get into my regular masseuse.  This place is close to my house and really inexpensive.  I lucked out and got "Andy" who really worked me over!  I will go back and recommend them to anyone.  Not rude like other reviewer says. Culture is just different from ours and if you understand that all is good!
