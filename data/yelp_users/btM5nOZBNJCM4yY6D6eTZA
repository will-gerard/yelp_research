While leaving Scottsdale to drive home, the hubby and I found this place randomly without me Yelping. (Which I never do now that Yelp and I have such a deep and intimate relationship.) But lo and behold, it wasn't so bad! It wasn't the best or varied Indian lunch buffet ever, but the food was right on, the veggies were good, the mango lassi was yummy, and the naan was spot on. My only  complaint was that I was cold the whole time. But that was probably just me. Good place for a lunch buffet here in Phoenix.

Does the job, not great, not amazing, not anything really except a room with a bed. You're better off at Stratosphere for the same price.

Ladies free before 1:00AM to get in, and cheap drinks. I didn't really like it because the music that's playing is from the jukebox and not everyone has great taste. I'm not really a slow RnB person when it comes to shaking it and that's what we got. The country wasn't too bad (not a country person) but at least it was danceable. This is just not really my scene. Maybe someone elses....

Very very pricey for what you get. But it's all about sitting outside and watching the Bellagio water works and the filet mignon merlot butter dish! Excellent service too.

I see why people stay here. But it just doesn't belong anymore...it's too old. I mean it, SUPER old. It's got cigarette stains everywhere. It either needs to be remodeled or torn down. Not worth your money, go to Excalibur if you're that desperate.

I was really impressed by the Mediterranean flare they had for the lunch buffet. And it was only $9.99. Service was great, they had an espresso machine that was really nice. So sorry about the bad reviews. I mean it's just your average buffet but I loved the food!

This is the de-stress of Vegas, I think. Just stare up at the ceiling, enjoy the show! Or listen to the street music. Or watch performances. Or eat some fried candy. Or just walk around. It's fun and nice and you can relax. No need to stress.

I don't care about eating on the Strip when I can find a great authentic hole-in-the-wall like this place and eat to my hearts content. Some of the best Thai I've had is here and the service is great. Don't expect anything fancy or nice here. This is just about the food and food only. I bet only locals come here, and it's a pity cuz tourists just don't know what they're missing.

Hubby booked a suite here for our first anniversary. Beautiful studio suite with kitchen and appliances and king size bed, jetted spa tub, rain head shower, two flat screen tvs and the view of the strip! It was great because I HATE paying $6 for a cup of tea, so I was able to go to Trader Joes, buy breakfast stuff, tea, wine and other things and enjoy in the room. The pool was super nice because half of it was shaded by the building, so even though it was 109 degrees outside, it was super nice in the pool. Plus free admission into their club Rain on Fri/Sat and free admission to Ghostbar and Moon on the other nights. Very very nice! Not bad for off the strip.

The music was great but the crowd was way too young. And I felt like I was about to fall down the stairs climbing that horrible climb. No. Not again.

Yes this place is really nice. Has a great atmosphere, good drinks, and the music was good. I'd come here again if I come back to Montreal.

NO!!!!! I went here with my cuz and her aunts thinking I was going to get a great Montreal club experience that I've been hearing about for ever. NO NO NO!!! I DO NOT LIKE TOURIST SPOTS!!! It's the local spots that are better. It had a turning dancefloor, it was so crowded AND the boys just grabbed me to dance. That's wrong. You ask. NO never ever again.

It's burgers made sub style. Just like at Quizno's you pick what you want on your sub, you get to pick out what you want on your burger! What a concept! They just make the burger fresher!!! This was really good and a Montreal must try! (I'm not sure if they are in the states, but if there are, they should be some near me!)

I liked it. The food was good. They had really nice samosas. I would have to eat again to confirm 5 stars but the prices seemed right to me. Very nice.

Came here because of all the reviews and didn't know where else to turn to for a birthday cake. I asked them for a Black Forest cake the day before the 60th birthday party I was about to throw. Mind you I was only here for a week, so everything for this party was really last minute. The people here are super friendly. Even though it was last minute, they were able to decorate the cake really beautifully and included glitter too as an extra touch. Not to mention how delicious the cake was! We bought some extra cakes just to try and everything was delicious. Real cream too! Will come back here if I'm ever in the area.

Came to see Le Magie des Lanterns....let me tell you it was spectacular! Came on the last day, Halloween, at night. All the lanterns were beautifully lit and it just made the Chinese gardens even more splendid. The bonsai plants were truly amazing. Also the Insectarium was really cool! A lot of live bugs and it was truly creepy and definitely Halloween. Walking through the greenhouses made the chilly night warm and see the Citrouille decorated (that's pumpkins!) just made it feel perfect. All in all, Montreal you are blessed with this place!

Hubby picked this place for dinner, and I'm so glad he did. This was the best dinner here. Yeah it's just Italian food, but the service was so great, I could write forever about it! I won't though, because I'll bore most of you. But our server knew what we wanted and finished our sentences. He was attentive and just very experienced and perfect. Our meal was great and the bread that comes with was excellent. The wine made us giddy for the next two hours. I would come back here again and again!

We wanted to go to the 777 buffet at the Plaza. But of course as luck would have it (like my joke?), it's no longer there and the buffet is more expensive and it was closed. We walked up and down Fremont Street, every buffet was either $30 or closed. Finally, I was about to faint, we walked in the Four Queens and I saw prime rib! I said hell ya! We're eating here! The prime rib was wonderful. It was tender and juicy. Yummy mashed potatoes. A nice little salad, great bread! Oh it was sooo good. My fellow peeps had teryaki chicken (also good) and country fried steak....ooohhh boy. Everything was amazing. And such a surprise because it was totally unexpected because this place is such a I-play-slots-all-night-long-that-I-blow-my-paycheck-and-need-food-at-one am-and-i-am-going-to-play-again-after cafe. Open 24 hours.

Two Words: Bath Bombs.   Take them to your jetted spa tub, drop it in, grab some wine, and chillax. Your skin will feel lovely and moisturized and divine. And the prices are a titch better than Lush. Their body butter is nice too, without parabens or other crap.

When you don't want to pay $19.99 for the breakfast buffet, this is the place to go for $5 breakfast specials. In fact, I would only come here for breakfast. Why waste money anywhere else when you can get yummy food for cheap.

First time I had poutine. Came on a super busy day. Everyone orders poutine here. The gravy was nice as well as the cheese curds. The fries were the best. I can see why it's so popular. However, CASH ONLY!!!!

I don't understand the mixed review but my experience was hands down the BEST cupcakes EVER! I had the Merry Margarita and Peanut Butter Chocolate. Frosting was light and not too sweet, just right. And cake was super moist and flavorful. Plus since it was after 7:00PM, you buy one get one free! So $3.50 for two!! Plus I've noticed that they sell Gigi's cupcakes EVERYWHERE in the hotels too. Maybe it's like Sprinkles, people might not like the hype, or it's not consistent.

Alcoholic ice cream.....need I say more??   Well I should. Since I'm preggers, I was worried about the alcoholic content, but since they don't card you and it's more flavor than alcohol, I indulged in Jack Daniels and Champagne. Wish they had this in SD.

On the third floor next to the elevator, there is a hallway that leads to this place. There are no signs nothing to indicate this is a pizza place. But once you find it, order any pizza and you'll be glad you did. It's super good for the price and it's kinda comparable to NY pizza but not quite.
