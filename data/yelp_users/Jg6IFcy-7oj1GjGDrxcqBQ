One of the best Thai places in Chandler. Heat is on the mild side so don't be afraid to order a little higher than you might normally at somewhere like Thai Rama.

Great food. Great beer (if you are into hoppy beers anyway). Fun place to hang out on the weekends and also a wonderful place for work happy hours. Try the nachos and wings!

Love this place! They have an amazing selection of organic foods as well as a great section of traditional and grass fed meats.  The prices are great too, especially on seasonal fruit and vegatables. If you like coconut milk make sure you try the Sprouts brand.

Bliss has hands down the best frozen yogurt I have ever had. Their unique blend of imported Italian yogurt with various flavors is truly wonderful. The numerous fresh fruit toppings provide nearly endless combinations which accent the yogurt wonderfully. Fair pricing and a great environment makes this place one of the best dessert places around. Definitely try it out if you are in the area and in my opinion it is even worth driving for. Do not be turned off by the small menu consisting of only a few flavors, once you try it you will be hooked. My favorite is the original. It is NOT a vanilla flavor but is something very unique and is not easily described. Top it with fresh strawberries and bananas for a fantastic treat.

This little gem, buried in a big strip mall is one of the best kept secrets i've found in Chandler. The place itself is easy to miss, located next to a massive furniture outlet but don't be fooled, it is actually much larger than it looks. Inside you'll find a wide open venue complete with a stage for nightly music. I haven't been in the evenings but I imagine it would be a cool place to hang out. The couches are comfortable and provide a nice laid back atmosphere for enjoying your coffee, surfing the web or chatting with friends.   Speaking of the coffee, prepare to be amazed. I am a coffee lover and SoZo has the best coffee I have had anywhere in Arizona. The selection of drinks and flavors is enormous and included unconventional choices such as sugar free macadamia nut. Lately I have been sticking with Americanos because I am trying to avoid really sugary drinks. The espresso here is the best I have had. It has a rich, deep, slightly sweet flavor that is perfect with just a touch of creamer. I've heard rave reviews about the cubano and other drinks as well.   Anyways if you are in the area and love coffee definitely gives this place a shot. You won't be disappointed.

BEWARE!! This business is extraordinarily shady. I used their biweekly lawn service for the majority of this summer (2013). I was extremely unsatisfied because they allowed my lawn to get totally overgrown with weeds and lawn disease that left it looking absolutely horrible.   Before it was time to put in my winter lawn I decided to cancel my service with them which is where things got really bad. I called several times and and left multiple voicemails informing them of my cancellation. I never received any form of return call or confirmation however they stopped charging my credit card and I stopped receiving mail from them and they stopped servicing my property so I thought things were done. This was at the end of October.   Today (December 13th) I received a call, voicemail and text message from them asking me to contact them. When I did I was told that I was past due on my bill and had not made a payment since October. When I told them that was because I cancelled my service they denied ever receiving any calls or voicemails. Most importantly they claimed to have serviced my property 3 times in the month of November. This was an absolute a blatant lie. I had hired another lawn company whom had done all work on my property. Nieto Landscaping had NOT been on my property whatsoever in the month of November. They also claimed to have mailed me numerous letters about being past due. This was also a lie. When I asked them to provide proof they were unable to do so.   I am sure I am not done with this fight yet but word to the wise. Stay away from these people.

Finally a legit auto repair shop run by upstanding guys who won't lie or try to rip you off. I took my 2010 Camaro here because the dealer told me I had a coolant leak and I also wanted to check out a rattle in my exhaust. After having the car for about 3 hours and pressurizing the system several times they determined there was no coolant leak and identified the rattle as coming from my resonated X pipe. The best part...they didn't charge me a dime because they didn't do any repair work. They could have easily charged me for the time my car was at the shop but they didn't and as a result I will be taking my car back to replace the resonated X when my new one comes in and for all future work I need done.
