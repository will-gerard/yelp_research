Simply put, no better place to get a cut and shave. I walked in with 6 customers in either in the chair or waiting to be. I was in a chair in 4 minutes. It took me 30 seconds for Ed to understand exactly what I was going for and off he went. With out me even having to tell him where I needed the most attention he navigated through the entire cut flawlessly. Such a beautiful cut I won't even have to style it for a week. Perfect experience and you will never find me in another chair.

It is lunchtime. I want it to taste good, be served quick, and priced so I can come here everyday. Look no further than City Market Deli. Randy Kasab is the man and the selection is so large you'll never have the same thing twice. No other place to lunch like this in Biltmore.

Considering the gentlemen, if you can call him that, on the phone called me a stupid mother f**cker and hung up on me telling me not to call back I'd have to say the service was not so great. This was in response to am over 2 hour wait time with not call from the restaurant. I called in and I have to assume they just forgot my pizza, it was a pepperoni pizza. Not the hardest pie in the world and I live maybe 2 miles away. He claimed it was New Years and that is why. Well then don't offer delivery. I'm sorry but when I see an ad up for pizza delivery, I would believe you would have taken the necessary steps to sufficiently staff your business. I mean, were you surprised it was busy? All in all, the pizza is normally okay minus the uncooked flour on the crusted and the consistently charred bottom. It's good for when you're drunk and have no choice or can simply just forget you ordered so their terrible service time goes unnoticed. Also, a couple off this ago a guy in a taxi can delivered my pizza. I'm not even sure he has his food handlers permit. I'd be surprised if this business meets standard requirements when it comes to proper food handling. Well I'll sit here and wait for a BS email from their manager talking about how that's not how we do business etc. hahaha

First and foremost, the only reason I gave this place a one star rating was because the decor was pleasant to the eye and the owner and or manager came by to refill our drinks. The meal was pedestrian, the wait staff was curt and only polite because it was their job. Finally the hostess hated her life and had an attitude problem because of it. Will not be returning, worst experience I've had. Don't come here,  go to chipotle instead.

As they promised it was less than 8 minutes through the line and believe me I was timing it from the start. I mean it is the first thing you see as you walk in to the store. Great location and they do deliver from 11am to 2pm which will now be well utilized going forward. The store however is very clean and warmly decorated, and it pulls me to come back again. I had the Italian which is one of their signatures and for good reason. I am a man of simple taste but a strict eye for detail. The sandwich was amazing to say the least. The help was knowledgable and very friendly. I could keep writing everything I enjoyed but I think I have given you enough to try for yourself! Who knows you might even run into me if you do!

Clearly they have done it again. I am an avid fan of the Citizen Public House and The Gladly is a beautiful addition to the Biltmore Corridor. I could go on and on about the food and the service, but you will experience this for yourself when you get there. Tim and Aaron truly made this experience an unforgettable first visit. The food was nothing short of spectacular and the drinks were top notch. Simply put, this dinner made me want to loose my manners.
