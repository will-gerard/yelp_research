Best car repair spot in town.  Tim is honest, hard-working, and knows his sh*t.  I've been in burgh for 3 years now.  I was driving a 2000 Nissan Maxima and it had 170K miles on it.  Now, I loved that car and whenever something went wrong I brought it in to Walter's.  Last time I brought it in I asked him if I should put more money into the car- the alternator was out and a new battery was needed.  The car would not start.  He told me it is a good time to get a new car because he wan't sure how much more this car could take.  He even gave me a couple of numbers of guys who buy cars "as is."  I called these guys and sold this beater maxima for $1000 as is!    Now, I drive a 2011 Malibu and I'm a happy girl.  Thank you Tim- I appreciate you looking out!  Other car repair shops would have fixed my car charged me out the azz only for my car to break down again.  Tim really does have your best interest.

So let me start off and say this is the best deli I've ever been to.  There is a cheese counter and a meat counter.  They have great prices, freshest products, biggest variety.  You name the cold cut and they have it here.    Name your cheese, they have it here.  They also have an olive bar, a huge pasta selection including freshly made pasta up by the registers.  They have fresh pizza doe, homemade pasta sauce, oil oils, balsamic vinegars, variety of nuts, crackers, cookies, veggies, fruits, breads.  Oh those pepperoni rolls are better than Mancini's pizza rolls.  Get them early in the am though or poof - gone!    Rivals any NYC deli and possibly beats due to better pricing.....  It's 5 star worthy!!!!

Groupon alert!  $70 for 2 includes the following:  1.  Bottle of vino 2.  Delicious bread basket- especially those thin slightly crisp bread sticks 3.  Caesar salad 4.  Pasta trio- oh those mushroom ravioli 5.  Tiramisu- my favorite part of the meal...just incredible  Double date night...friend encouraged me...thank you so much.  Pleasure!    Oh and friends husband switched the Caesar for the seasonal beet ensalade...looked beautiful.  I dislike being one of those peeps that just ain't in to beets.  Colorful beets too...yellows, reds, simply gorg.  Great Groupon because this meal would have been $130 or more....

I've been here twice and ordered to-go once.  The food is bad!  Last night our table ordered French fries, stuffed portabella mushrooms, and calamari.  The best of the dishes were the mushrooms stuffed w crab meat and topped w red peppers...the fries and calamari were terrible!  I don't want to come back here...it's over priced and the food is below ave

i highly recommend this pizza.  i'm a fan of several different pizza styles and this is a good old medium crust style.  it's more on the side of ny style pizza with that medium sized crust.  i tried a large mushroom with half pepperoni.  they bury the pepperoni under the cheese (minus one star).  i prefer seeing the pepperoni because of the fact we only wanted half the pizza with pepp and couldn't tell which side was which.  we had leftovers and i wasn't as big of a fan of the cold pizza from here.  i will say though, this pizza fresh from the oven- the best i've had yet here in pittsburgh.

i must be missing something because this place seemed expensive for dry cleaning.  they outsource the dry cleaning and didn't really make recommendations on any of my garmets.  i've gone to cleaners before that will tell me to wash over dry clean or startch, ect.  to top it all off the place didn't have my garmets back the day they said they would.  so, i had to make another trip across town to pick them up.  where are the $1.95 per garmet dry cleaning shops in pittsburgh?  this place is out of my dry cleaning budget!

This review is based on the spin class I just tried over here.  First time ever at spin and the trainer, Courtney helped me set up properly on the spin bike, made sure I was comfortable and made me feel like I could do it even though I thought I would pass out at certain points during the class.  All I know is Courtney teaches the class 7:30p on Thursday.  The class in an hour long which I don't like because that just seems so long.  The thing is it goes by so quick and it may have to do with the music sets.   I will be back for sure.    The rumor is that Katie Holmes tried this class out too!  The girl has got some good taste.  Still love TOM!

Pastries, brownies, doughnuts, breads, cakes, cupcakes, cookies, danishes, muffins, and more.  Reasonable prices and fresh goodies!    Today was my first experience at Pranti's.  BF and I walked in and it was packed but the wait was not long before someone asked what we wanted.    My eyes darted back and forth trying to pick something.  That was a challenge.., Finally after talking to the counter girl, my BF, and myself I decided to go with a brownie and a cookie.  BF picked a doughnut.  The bill came to under $4 bucks.    The chocolate chip cookie was as thick as a blondie bar but bigger in circumference.    The brownie was enormous and has walnuts in it.    The doughnut was chocolate and vanilla frosted and my man ate it up within 2 seconds flat.    Addicting!  Delicious baked treats.  The coffee cakes here with the white powdery stuff on top looked so good.  Maybe next time....

i like keegan's.  it's a small chain in phoenix.  they also have one on camelback and another in queen creek.  the food is quality for the most part.  it's american style with some original twists.  the grilled chicken sandwich has a marinated cucumber on it and it's such a nice touch and really makes the sandwich.  also if you order a salad make sure you order the lime ginger vinaigrette dressing.  it's homemade delciousness.    the peach cobbler is to die for and so is the mudpie.    i used to work here years ago and the place is clean and the chefs know what they're doing.  so, i may be biased to keegan's.

it's a winner.  make sure you sit outside on the lake and order the mini taco basket split between 2 people.  free chips, salsa and bean dip are plenty especially along with the ritas on the rocks.  it's also a kick azz happy hour because the apps are half-off.  the food is cheap and super good.  don't try and walk around the lake though.  it doesn't connect up in a full circle.  and don't swim in that sh*t either.  just eat the good food at valle luna:-)

Found a deal on hotels.com for just over $300 for 2 nights...grabbed it and feel very happy with the hotel at this price.  The poolside waitstaff was on it, the views from top of the rock were gorgeous, the location was perfect, the comfort of Marriott, the overall accommodation was relaxing...this is a family friendly spot. parking is $10 a night...I would go back!

parking in the southside isn't as difficult as i thought it was going to be.  check down the side streets and you're sure to find a spot within 10 minutes TOPS.  mario's is a great spot for some appetizers and drinks.  the happy hour on friday was a little loud and the bar music was competing with some dude singing and playing guitar in the other room.  here's the thing, the chicken nachos were $4 or $5 during happy hour and my cocktails were $2 a piece.  this is a steal!  you can't make chicken nachos at home for $5.  the nachos are served with sour cream and salsa and i was pleased that the waitress brought a little cup of each for both me and my man.  we love mario's especially at the happy hour price.  yummy nachos, strong drinks, chill atmosphere, cheap prices is our equivalent to a great night out.  i recommend eating in the bar area.  the tables in the other area (where the dude was singing) seem claustraphobic.

Solid pizza and great prices.  The pizza has just the right amount of dough, cheese, sauce, and preferred toppings.  This is what I consider pan style pizza non- thick variety...good stuff!  The atmosphere here is more dive bar but cozy at the same time.  Service is good...jukebox in the corner.  I like this spot.

it's a cute thai spot with some good food.  the best seat in the house is by the back window so you can gaze at the street below and have a full view of the restaurant.  the food is generous helpings of yummy thai food.  i had the red curry chicken dish level 7 spice.  it was perfect.  will be going back.

placed a to go order here last night and our order was ready when i arrived.  mind you i drove all the way from the other side of town just to eat thai food that i knew wouldn't dissappoint.  i had the pineapple chicken thai curry dish.  generally speaking, i dislike peas but they are a nice add to this dish.  spice level was a 7.  absolutely delicious!  my boyfriend opted for the chicken cashew dish which included broccoli.  we both ate every last bite.  we're both fans of the place.  it was good getting it to go too.  it did seem a little pricey being just short of $30 total for both dishes.  it's worth it though- get that thai food fix!  oh and they do deliver now- they had a sign in the window......

wow.  it's by far the greatest seafood place i've been in for quite sometime.  today was all about the seafood salad for me.  excellent.  i'll be back to try much more.  there was a good sized lunch crowd in here eating sandwiches.  those lobsters looked incredible and the enormous scallops caught my eye.  stay tuned on an update.

station square isn't my favorite place to be.  the reasons go something like this:  1. entering the square is a headache, never really know where to park 2. parking costs $ and remembering to validate is an annoyance 3. even after validating you may have to pay a few bucks for parking 4. exiting the square and taking a left isn't always easy- make sure to exit at a light 5. the mall at station square is a joke but it does have a lottery ticket machine!  The 2 best locations in station square are:  1.  Sesame Inn 2.  the lottery machine  Sesame Inn is good stuff.  The egg rolls are bomb.  Get a dish with shrimp in it.  The shrimp is gigantic.  The spice could use some help though.  Between Sesame Inn and PF Changs, I'd choose Sesame Inn everytime.  It's a hit in a very obscure place in station square.  It's my spot!

Terrible!  I came here based off the previous reviews.  I was going to hit up KFC... kicking myself for not...this place is off the 51 in burgh which is by far one of the worst roads and must have a high suicide rate.  Every time I'm on the 51 I want to run myself off the road out of irritation by the constant stop and go and the grind of that road seriously it's awful.  My thoughts initially though was that Frisch's is worth it because it gets 5 stars and the chicken looked great in a previous yelpers photo.  I stopped in around 7:30pm last night and being that it was a Saturday night it was open until 10p.  Anyway, I arrive at Frisch's and notice immediately that the place is not well kept.  I even watched someone cleaning a counter with a dirty rag that was probably used for weeks.  Dirty rags don't clean they need to be washed...seriously, the place is gross.  It just had a feeling of people cutting corners and not giving a F@*k.  I should have left...instead I figured I'd just take the chicken to go.  I noticed some very old chicken and pizza together in a heat box that you typically see in gas stations.  You know, food that's been sitting around forever.  I ordered a chicken dinner, nope, they didn't have any chicken (or so I was told).  They said it would be at least a half hour wait.  Say what!?  I knew this was my chance to escape this hell hole.  I cancelled my order and darted.  Never to return...dirty, carelessness, no chicken at a chicken spot on a Saturday evening, located near one of the worst roads I've ever encountered...good-bye Frisch's.  I made my decision to cut you out and after I type this sentence I won't look back again.  Peace!

nice speak-easy lounge in the scottsdale block of bars.  i always enjoy the atmosphere here and one time even saw amber tamblyn sitting up at the bar.  it's a good stop during a night out in scottsdale.  i suggest making this one of your first stops of the night.  it's not too wild and has a good people watching vibe.

solid 4 star place.  don't hesitate to hit up the happy hour with some friends and take advantage of the $11 pitchers and a pile of excellent nachos.  the nachos are the type with melted cheese and not ballpark cheese sauce which i hate on nachos!  the crowd here is very relaxed and non-pretentiious.  it's a great spot for outdoor seating.  this was my first stop last night.  next stop was.....american junkie

the place is huge and has a great outdoor seating area.  macayo's always has some sort of drink special going on- just ask!  i've never ate too much at macayo's but when i do it always hits the spot.  this place was my first stop on a lightrail adventure in day drinking!  come here with a group or for happy hour or for day drinking or for outdoor seating.  lots of reasons to come here, see!?

Today was my second time in the joint.  There was no line in here because it's a Tuesday.  The weekends are ridic so I recommend checking it out mid-week.  I don't even care for biscotti's because they are typically a challenge to eat and there are biscotti's galore in here...  The reason I came in here was because I wanted a sweet treat..,something other than chocolate.  I ordered the raspberry turnover which was pressed flat and not exactly crescent shaped as they typically tend to be.  This thing was delicious!  Dusted crystal sugar on top and flaky the way turnovers tend to be when they are so fresh.  The store is small and has variety of breads, dessert case with scones, brownies, cookies, turnovers, and much more.  The price here is slightly high but still within reason.  My treat was $2.50 and worth every cent!

this is NOT the best pizza in phoenix and NOT the best pizza in the USA.  come on now i saw this place on oprah because gail king was combing the country to get the best pizza and names this place.  i prefer oregano's or nypd to this.  maybe this is appetizer style pizza?  oh and the wait?  are you serious?  we had the margherita pizza and the sausage and mushroom pizza- both which have some fru-fru names.  something about this place doesn't jive.  it's fake pizza!

someone once told me hiking isn't a big deal, "it's just walking on a path"  this is no ordinary walk.  it's a thrilling hike with challenges and gorgeous views.  it's quite the workout.  there are certain points on this hike where i feel like i'm actually rock climbing.  parking can be insane on weekends but it's worth waiting 15 minutes for a spot to open.

it's the best mexican i've had in the area.  mad mex can't touch this place when it comes to the food...unfortunately, there is no liquor served here.  even beer would be nice.....thing is....the place has the best tacos around.  the rice has the spice it should at a mexican joint.  they do serve a complimentary chips and salsa basket.  they will not refill FOC on those chips though...  bottom line- if you want the real deal cooked fresh to order, come here.  please note- the decor is nothing to write home about....

My hubs and I joined another couple for NYE dinner.  They had a special NYE menu which we looked up online ahead of time and the options looked terrific (filet and lobster tail, blackened catfish, seared tuna, and crab cakes).  The regular menu was also an option.  I ordered a small house salad which was ok, not much to it just lettuce and dressing blah...for dinner I opted for the seared tuna- terrible!!  I asked the waitress which item was the best on the special NYE menu and she recommended stk and lobster so I thought maybe I ordered wrong?  NOPE!  My friend ordered it and it was pure salt.  Rather gross and not edible and I like salt but this was insane...expensive, waitress who cared less, bad food...it leaves me upset that we came here.  My dish was stringy- the seared tuna...it came w sushi rice that was crunchy.  Just not good!    The bill between 4 of us was $220.  I'm still pissed!

not sure why they changed the name from squaw peak.  sup witdhat?  now, back to happy thoughts.  it's my 2nd favorite hike in phx.  i've seen someone seriously injured on this mountain in the past (not happy times).  the very last climb right before you reach the top scares me the most.   it feels like you can/will fall right over the side of this monster.  you have to be in some type of shape to get up this mountain but i still think it easier than camelback.    i have no idea how people run up and down this peak but everytime i go, sure enough somebody runs right past me.  oh and camelback is my #1

One of my favorite places to get a great steak, cocktail, and lobster Mac and cheese.  I came here after a brutal Buccos defeat and the place was packed...walked in and headed for the bar.  I did notice everyone at the bar had calamari which looked really good and was only $6 bucks...that's a steal a Hyde Park.  However tempting that calamari looked I passed and went for the petit filet, side of lobsta Mac, and spinach/mush side dish.  All delicious!  They do it right here serving the filet with crispy onions.  They don't have happy hour on Saturday but it looked like they have a bar menu with special pricing anyways.  Garrett Jones was up in here mellowed out but one obnoxious drunkard kept bugging him.  Ridic!

really nice stadium.  it's relatively new being built back in 2001.  they even have a primanti bros up in here.  parking is fairly easy and i do recommend taking the 7th street bridge because 6th is closed for game time.  it's a good togetherness feeling in the stadium and fireworks go off when the pirates hit a homer.  i really enjoy this ballpark.

came here last night and service was so slow but the place was empty.  the nachos are the ballpark cheesy kind.  i prefer the shredded cheese type on my nachos.  the wings- good. again, just come here for wings and you may have to wait for the waitress to come over for a long long time.

Excellent BYOB spot in south side.  There were some older guys kicking it here godfather style with vino flowing...table pounding, jokes and lots of laughter.  I'm not sure if that's the normal here but it created a fun enviroment.  Sad to say that I didn't know it was BYOB or we would have brought vino or beer beverages in.....tonight it was water for my SO and I...(SO meaning significant other).  We ordered the hummus and pita bread which was excellent.  I ordered the chicken house salad which comes with iceburg lettuce, toms, olives, cheese, cucumber, chicken.  HUGE!  The dressing is good stuff...Kevan (SO) ordered the spicy chicken sandwich which looked like a gyro.  I had a bite and could not even identify the spice but wow that kick was good!  The total cost $24 without tip.  I did notice there are some more expensive dinner style options here which i will go back and try no doubt (like the filet skewers).  This is a great place for some Lebanese style grub.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND and BYOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!

my chica's and i stayed here over a girls weekend get-away.  we may have paid full price because spring training and 'tis the time to be in phoenix.  that being said, we paid too much but i recommend this resort.  it's cute, it's in a great location, it's got a great pool, bar service at the pool, a nice restaurant, great rooms, and just an overall good feeling here.    we had a couple of frozen drinks out by the pool and i loved the it!  try and ask for free drink coupons at the front desk because those babies are $10 bucks a pop!  recommended

BYOB with a $5 corkage fee.  this is a hole in the wall italian joint with food to die for.  the warm bread served with olive oil was delicious.  the greens and bean appetizer comes with spinach, garlic, onions, banana peppers, hot sausage and is simply amazing.  i ordered the mushroom ravioli special and was very pleased.  the price is reasonable and the BYOB is a win.  i will come back and i don't mind driving out of downtown pittsburgh to get here because the quality, the taste, the price, the BYOB, the atmosphere it's all worth it!

Wonderful Peruvian style chicken!  This was one of H Ward's spots when he lived at the cork factory...legit chicken and get it w rice and blk beans.  Ask for a side of their "special green sauce" it kicks your butt!  Totally delicious and under $10.  It's also Byob btw.

BYOB!!!  The will charge $1 per glass and considering there is no corkage fee, it's quite the bargain.    The outdoor side patio here is overflowing with plant and flowers and super green and peaceful.  The food is amazing.  I love the curry dishes.  Last night I tried the shrimp pineapple fried rice and it was heavenly.  Started our dinner with the pork dumplings and they are amazing served with a nice dipping sauce.  The dumplings come 4 to an order which I thought was a good amount but my bf was hungry for 1 more dumpling.    It's just a great place.  It's also a pretty place with some amazing food.

I am SO sold on Judit.  My sister and I called to get in for pedicures on a Saturday.  Needless to say, they were completely booked.  We shopped around online for another option.  Within a half an hour Judit called back and said we could come in @ 4PM.  They took us together and it was the most relaxing, thorough pedicure I've ever had!  The salon is not beautiful or modern but it is very quaint and welcoming.  The pedicure was $45 each.  Very reasonable for this amazing service here.  I will go back.

went back for another pedicure.  again, no one does it better.  if you want the job done well for any spa type services this is the place in the burgh to go.  pedicure, manicure, facial, waxing, massage.  this is the spot.  again, it's not cheap but it is well worth the price.   p.s.- make sure you bring a cash tip

best kept secret for breakfast in old town.  i ordered the open faced breakfast sandwich and was so happy!  it comes on a creamy texas toast base with your choice of prepared egg, bacon and a side of hash browns.  I went over-easy on the egg and my mouth is watering just thinking about this breakfast.  it was so good!  the plus here is adding a bloody mary was only $1.99 with breakfast.  me and my girls got a round!  why not?

There are some mixed reviews on here so I was pleasantly surprised with this place because it was very good.  Started the night with a dirty martini which was made very well.  It was not too olive juicy...the house bread was an assortment and yummy!  next up the house salad with white balsamic vinigrette dressing which was excellent.  The dressing always makes the salad and this dressing was very good.  Next course was the lobster Mac and cheese which was so rich and really to die for...loved the lobster flavoring and how the macaroni were shells...oh so delicious.  For the main course I ordered the Bronzino...oh that white flakey fish was perfection....it came with cauliflower which I didn't even know I liked!  It goes to show veggies are delicious when properly prepared.  My hubs ordered the scallops and loved them.  We finished with the choc cake and it was average...that was the only part of the meal I wasn't that in to....and I'm I big dessert fan.  Very good experience and good food!

the fry's on baseline near south mountain is kind of beat.  i prefer this new walmart.  it's much less crowded, cleaner, and green!  as you walk through the freezer aisles the lights are censured.  i love it!  it's also cheaper groceries.  i've only been twice so i need to do some further research on products so standbye.

Interesting spot in he strip.  Something is slightly DL about this place because you enter through a side door.  Cost of a draft is $2.75.  LIT (long island iced teas) on Sunday nights for HH.  No one in here cares who you are or why you are here.  My husband and I came in here for a beer and to play photo hunt.  No one bugged us...there is an upstairs but we never went up.  Recommended dive gay bar.  I may have been the only girl up in this piece tonight...

went for a glass of wine and ended up having 3 along with some calamari.  now, i've had a decent share of calamari.  this was in my top 2.  it's tender and just delicious.  they serve it with lemon zest.  the dipping sauce was just different with a lemon garlic flavor.  my other top calamari pick is actually at a chain in manchester, ct- john harvards.  it's little rings and spicey.  so, 2 very differently prepared types of calamari both good.  cioppino is also in a great location -the strip.  it's a beautiful restaurant.  bartender was nice too.

This is what I've been missing?!  No one told me how great Toast is WTF?  Ha.  Saturday night with a couple yelpies we stopped in here around 10:30ish for a small bite and some wine.  Small bite turned into a cheese plate and the shrimp and grits.  I keep thinking about that shrimp and grits dish- fantastic!  I always picture sloppy breakfast looking grits.  Is this picture off base?  YES!  I also enjoyed how the wine is served with choice of the pour...gives room to sample.  I tried the chianti and it made me warm right up on a chilly night.   Last but not least the chocolate dessert!  Just magnificent!  The waiter told our table that peeps come in just for that choc dessert.  It's that good!  I'll be back.

come to the strip for Cafe Raymond..the secret is still safe. Meaning...the lines and wait aren't ridic like penn ave fish can be... My fave is still the Tom/mozz/pesto sandwich.  Get it to go and it comes w a pickle but no chips.  Eat on site, chips are also served...  Recently I tried the salad that starts w an n...I forget the name but it comes w tuna on it.  It's wonderful too.

for the moment, this grocery store is much less pricey compared to whole foods.  they have a good looking salad bar, a half-way decent looking hot dinner bar, and plenty of seats for eating.  the fruit and veggies are very reasonably priced and look terrific.  the cheese selection is outstanding.  today, they provided samples of a bandage chedder which had a great sharp taste to it.  i went back for seconds.  subtracted a star because i've noticed they don't always ring the prices up as posted in the store.  watch this upon check out.

lately when i get berries from here, they go bad a day later.  not happy with this!  i still love the store though just may not get organic strawberries, blackberries, or razzies anymore because i end up having to throw them away when the mold appears 1 day later.

just got a new olive bar back by the meat counter!  i just love this store.  the other day i went in and got some turkey meat at the deli, i asked to try some and of course they gave me a sample.  smoked turkey was so good.  i also noticed that when i buy the spinach that comes in the bins over pre-bagged spinach it is much less of a hit on my purse.  just a little tip....

get that bruschetta, this is why i come here.  bruschetta and wine.  albeit this time i had beer because the $7.50 beer pitcher special was way too good to pass up on and i was day drinking and beer gives me a fighting chance to stay in the fun and games of day drinking.    lightrail stop #4.

I wish it would stay open later on the weekdays.  It's a great pizza spot.  The single slices are gi-normous.  The bar area is fun for a beer and watching a game.  Tonight, i ordered a medium pepperoni and mushroom to go and like usual it was a great pizza.  Fresh mushrooms and full pieces of crispy pepperoni along with little bits of pepperoni tasted great!  The sauce here is on the sweet side, crust is good.  Better than average pizza in burgh and it's home style restaurant are a win in my book.  oh and tonight I noticed the hot oven grinders looked really good!  Will try soon....

Great location within walking distance to the mall and several great restaurants in the south park neighborhood in Charlotte.  The hotel is nice and has above average service and amenities.  There was complimentary champagne, sweets, and breakfast every day of our stay.  We were out and about in Char and didnt utilize everything the hotel has to offer but the bedding was very comfortable and the bathroom was large and included all basic needs (shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, etc).  I even wheeled a big old chair into the bathroom to help my sister get ready for a night out (hair and makeup).  We set up in impromptu vanity....pumped up some music and had some vino.  Good times!  This beats the downtown Marriott in my book (no additional cost for parking).  Yep!  Oh, and there is a restaurant you must hit up for breakfast or lunch right near here (Terrace cafe).  Oh so good!

Excellent guacamole and chips.  Thin sliced jalapeanos top the guacamole off and give the dip a nice zing.  This is such a great spot inside or out...come here for a good Mexican snack, a Mexican beer or margharita and a kicked back atmosphere.  This spot reinforces how Lawrenceville has some of the greatest spots in the city.

Let me start off by saying the decor in here is nothing special.  The table clothes could use a good cleaning.  It's hard to find the front door to even enter the restaurant.  The atmosphere is part odd/part hole in the wall.    Our waiter was the only other person we ever saw.  There was no one else the restaurant the entire time we dined.  I'm not sure why because this is another great BYOB place that has the food to back it up.  We brought champagne!  I ordered the grilled jalapeno chicken which comes with plantains, rice, and a salad.  The jalapeno chicken was amazing.  The salad was nothing special the plantains were wonderful.    I will be going back and I recommend checking this spot out and trying something new.  Good stuff!

I miss donuts so much and must say this place was so disappointing.  I don't want to have political chat when trying to get my donut grub on and don't want to hear crap about how corporate america is taking over and the new giant eagle in robinson has copied....blah blah bla blah bl blah!  Shut up man!  Oh and they are overpriced.  The thing is they are good but can we get a nice donut shop in the strip where we don't have to hear about this stuff on a nice sunny morning.  Come on now.....WTF!?  Please lower the cost and shut the hell up!

great spot in downtown phoenix.  our day drinking party got loud by this stop (#5) on the lightrail adventure.  our party didn't try any food but we did find a great mix of people in here and some nice stiff drinks.  did we need those at this point, probably not!

i don't have much to compare this with in pittsburgh because this is the only place i've lived in pittsburgh......i did however check out the heinz loft when i first moved here and i thought the cork factory had a better deal (price was right) it also had a better atmosphere and better apartments.  anyways this is how i feel about the cork factory:  this is a gorgeous, unique, clean apartment complex.  they have a free happy hour for residents every thurs night!  wine and pizza are served.  FOR FREE!  they have some killer grills out back in between the river walk and the pool.  i loved going out last summer, throwing some dinner on the grill and having a cocktail while waiting and people watching.    there is also a gym with 2 flat screens, 4 treadmills, 2 ellipticals, free weights, and some basic weight lifting machines.  it gets the job done!    the apartments are all different in size and shape and have a great lofty feeling to them.  the apartments are open- meaning they don't have bedroom doors and the bedroom walls do not go all the way up to the ceiling.  those ceilings are mighty high.....  it's also a plus if you work downtown.  no car necessary.

Delicious!  I was here with a group of 7 or 8 girls and we really enjoyed our dinner here.  I ordered the 8 oz filet which was priced around $35 dollars and worth every penny.  It came with onions and it was just fabulous!  The atmosphere is flirty and fun and our waiter was happy and nice to us.  We also ordered a couple of appetizers including the artichoke which i enjoyed.  it came with 2 dipping sauces.  i'd rate the appetizers at 3 stars and give my filet 5 stars.  go with the steak here!  scottsdale mall is a great mall!  this steak house is in the mall.

I loved the food here!  I swear Mt Leb has some of the greatest restaurants and every time I'm in the area it grows on me more and more.  Kous Kous is a small Byob Mongolian spot.  My buddies and I made reservations ahead of time and judging by the small size and people getting turned away at the door reservations are a must.  I went with the chicken and shrimp dish and I almost licked the plate clean...super delicious!  We also had the red pepper hummus served w peppers and eggplant also excellent.  Chef is a tall slender guy who takes careful time and prep w every dish.  Skip the desserts here...we tried the choc almond torte and it was nothing special (not made in-house).  The price ranges from $15-$22 per dish but the Byob keeps cost down.  Between 3 people our bill ran $90...not bad for superb food.

My love for Aspinwall....best residential neighborhood in burgh.  This coffee shop makes me so freakin happy.  I go here very often, on the reg.  The chai tea latte tastes like the best oatmeal cookie...although..., typically, I go for the iced coffee...so strong!  So good!  Under $2.  Bagel, egg, and cheese sandwich is spot on and that blueberry crumb cake is my ultimate go to here...cool vibe, my favorite spot to just sit outside and people watch.

Greatest dive bar in the strip.  Come here for strong cheap drinks and to play video photo hunt or darts.  They also always have paper-view fights playing and never charge a cover.  Seriously, Lefty's is clutch...I love Lefty's!

I come here about 1-2 times a month for a generous portion of chicken and rice.  There are typically 3-4 different chicken dishes here.  That's usually what I stick with...,the chicken options.  They also have a beef or lamb option.  The order goes like this:  -go up to the counter and point at what you want -that's it!  The guys serving you at the counter will throw in whatever you want and mix and match to your liking.  The basic order is a main meat option, rice, and your choice of salad or vegetable.  The mixed veggie option is good!    I am not a fan of the desserts here.  They aren't sweet enough for me...  Friendly service, reasonable prices, get it to go.., otherwise you can sit and eat in the cafeteria style dining they have here.  Personally, I prefer eating at home in front of the TV.    Oh and the building was painted up last summer and it looks cool.  One more thing- they have a market here now too.  Haven't checked it out but will soon...

Lived up to the hype.  I stopped in tonight when my Greek/pita/hunger craving set in earlier.  I yelped the word "Greek" and this spot came up as número uno.  I noted yelp gave it darn close to 5 stars with plenty of reviews.  ordered the grilled chicken gyro nice clean eats with bites of cucumber, grilled chick, toms, tzatziki sauce, pita bread no mess.  Under $8.  Be back soon to try hummus to go...

Loved the bread basket here and frequently think about it days after my dinner here!  Butter served soft, corn muffins perfectly sweet, onion bread was out of this world, and the white bread was delicious!  The service here was wonderful with recommendations made and catered to our needs (refill on the bread basket). I came in on a Friday and was really happy with the service, the menu options, and the food.  The menu changes often from what our servers said...my veal meatball dish was flavorful and filling.  It was served with mushrooms, greens, toast, and 3 meatballs.  This was my first time here and I will be back.  It's not one of the over rated spots in town.  It's dead on 4 stars.  Seriously I'd go for some great wine and that bread basket alone.

Stopped in here for a late breakfast.  Really great prices and fast service.  I ordered the French toast -generous portion and is served w powdered sugar.  Yummy!  Reminds me of a northeast diner.  The cakes here looked enticing but I already had my sweet spot fulfilled RE: French toast.

big open spaces are always a plus and that's urban active.  it does get crowded here though.  the classes are why i like this gym so much.  love the saturday morning class and recently got into the monday night step class.  they move so quick in there!  dripping sweat...,that's when i know it was a great workout!  the drawback is that parking garage thing.  why do we have to go up to 4th floor to park?  not sure still....

Tops my cool crowd/good drinks/good location/fun atmosphere list.  It's somewhat of a lounge atmosphere.  If you are looking for a diverse crowd, a good vibe, and a decent cocktail come here.    **on a side note when I went to use the restroom I forgot to lock the door.  I noticed someone gently shutting the door (the person must've opened it while duty was callling me).  No loud entrance- I didn't even know someone tried coming in just the door quietly closing.  Whoever that was is on a good karma list.  :-)

Ordered a grilled chicken Greek salad to go.  The salad had a sh$t ton of melted cheese and fries on top.  So gross!  This is not a Greek salad.  I also asked for a side of Greek dressing or vinaigrette.  Got home to find out ranch was on the side.  I also ordered an order of hummus and pita bread the hummus looked hard and gritty.  I won't be back.  Not good!  Didn't even try the hummus it looked that unappetizing.  Straight to the trash w that hummus.

The belly was so happy after this grub! I love the Carolina style BBQ with the vinegar flavors.  I tried the sampler and split it with my husband.  We tried the beef brisket, the sausage, the pulled pork, and the chicken.  My favorite was the pulled pork.  The chicken had a mayo looking dressing which I was not feeling so I recommend doubling on the pulled pork because you get 4 meat options on the sampler.  the sampler also includes 2 side orders.  We selected the collard greens and the BBQ beans both excellent!  Seriously love me some Carolina BBQ!!!  Be prepared to wait in line here...it's worth it.

Very enjoyable time for all at the arts fest!  Unique pictures, paintings, crafts, pottery, and people!  Last night I joined some other yelpsters to see Edward Sharp perform at the festival FOC!  The crowd was fun lots of happy people dancing and although I was far off from the stage I could hear the blue grassy style music loud and clear.  I was also enjoying watching the crowd.  I made my way down to the point and the water fountain is on!!!  Pretty!  Finally!  The yelpsters and I stopped in at the Dozens food truck and I went for a blondie which was good!  Slightly oily but still tasted good.  Huge in portion!  We also stopped by for a $6 beer from Penn Ave (stand set up near food trucks).  Good times.

Naaaaaaa  Doesn't quite do it.  Sorry!  My first issue is the guacamole.  It has some sort of white cream added in it that dulls the taste.  Why do this to guac?  I ordered the taco platter.  It is served with 2 tacos, rice and beans.  I did like the rice and beans.  The tacos were good but nothing special.   I choose the shredded chicken and the grilled chicken.  Enjoyed the shredded over the grilled.....I will give a shout out for the chips and salsa- they were good!  Needs a little more spice for my taste though (salsa).  Other issues I have with this spot include the following:  1.  it's a pain to get out here on a pain of a road where turning left or right to get to and from could create major anxiety and concern of getting blasted by another car. 2.  no alcohol (the guy at the counter did say they are considering BYOB) 3.  no character to the atmosphere- very BLAH (throw on some music or put some work into a decor of some sort doesn't have to be anything fancy)  The dude behind the counter told me Reyna foods is going to put a shop in here downstairs.  That may help this place out?    Honestly, I prefer going to the stand in front of Reyna and getting street tacos any day of the week!

No!  Second time here and the service stinks!  I need to find a spot near Pitt with a good bar, good food, tv, and good service.  This place has a tv and that's about it on my checklist.  I had the margarita pizza, it was 3 stars.  Nothing to crave or think about again...nice size portion served with hot pepper flakes and some shaved cheese on the side of the pizza.  Kinda weird...and wasteful because I didn't touch the extra cheese.  Already forgot about the pizza itself.  The service sucked though.  No greeting from the bartender.  Had to repeatedly ask for a menu.  Skimped on the Malbec glass of wine and after I finished had to ask for the check.  I was the only person sitting at the bar though!  I guess he was busy filling the waitstaff drink orders...I just don't want to come back here.

Yeah, this DD is solid.  Fast service, plenty of fresh doughnut and munchkin options, perfect location on Forbes to walk to from PITT.  I'm sure i'll his this up on the reg.  Skip Starbucks across the street and get a chocolate frosted and a coffee here for the same calories, right?  haha

Great location for a wine/spirit store in the heart of Lawrenceville.  Small but packs a punch w lots of options on the wine, champagne, and alcohol fronts.  The price is in line and the service is friendly.  Oh and there is a great Byob spot down the street (Piccolo Forno).    In fact hubs and I came here last night and picked up 2 bottles of red, bottle of champs, and some vodka.  Total bill was $50.  I like you you cute little store!

The food is the best BBQ I've had in Pittsburgh.  The meats fall right off the bone and are just so juicy and seasoned well.  They have 5 or 6 diff types of BBQ sauce all with a little kick.  The best side are the black eyed pees - amazing!!!  Don't eat inside- take it to go...

Nice set up in here with the bar in a horseshoe type shape in the center and tables surrounding both sides of the bar.  Great place to watch a game- plenty of flat screens...  I ordered the turkey club which had a weird name that I can't recall.  It was excellent- really good quality turkey and avocado on sourdough served w fries.    The drinks are STIFF!  Get a stiffy!  Haha

Opted for fro-yo over ice cream on national ice cream day.  I didn't even know such a holiday existed!  No complaints here.  Oh Yogurt is a self-service yogurt bar.  They have several different flavors and options including no sugar added options, low fat fro-yo, sorbet, basic choc, basic vanilla, peanut butter flavor, and my personal fave cake batter.  All told they have somewhere around 15-20 diff options.  The toppings bar is also "do it yourself.". I added the mini m&m's.  You pay based on the weight.  Mine came to $4.50 and it was a generous portion.  I'm loving me some of this!

This place has won me over.  At first I didn't really get it and was confused here.  Do I shop for groceries?  Do I order prepared food?  Where do I order?  Do I get waited on?  Is there alcohol served?  whats up with the island in the middle?  Do i order coffee separate at the coffee bar?  The set up was not typical and I shied away.  Now it's become one of my spots on the reg.  I love the coffee window and the HOOoooo jolt from the cold brew coffee or espresso.  The sandwiches are delicious and to order just go up to the island and they give you a number.  Sit wherever u want inside or out...the salads are also really good.  This is quality and you get what ya pay for.  Can't speak for the groceries...oh and it's Byob.  Do it!  bring it!  Especially for brunch mimosas.

One of my favorite spots.  Quality!  Cookies that rival Nancy B's...expensive but worth every penny.  Try the chicken/bacon/avocado sandwich.  It's 5 star worthy...comes with beet chips.  Love love the coffee bar here too.

For the last couple of years my work crew has had our Christmas party at Oliver Twist.  This year I called Oliver's & Luke's and there was no comparison- Luke was much more flexible and had better offerings for food so I scheduled our party at his restaurant.  I'm so happy I did!  It was outstanding and I received so many compliments from my work crew!  We had just under 30 people total at the party.  We had the party upstairs in the restaurant in the bear lounge and the bar upstairs.    There was quite the spread of appetizers across the upstairs bar including salad station, catfish bites, crab dip with flat bread, veggies, oysters (we didn't even discuss oysters-Luke just gave them to us), chicken skewers, and any drinks we wanted...those catfish bites and that crab dip were so good!!!  Dinner was shrimp scampi, salmon, cod, mashed pots, and we even received 3 cheesecakes!!!  The food, the service, the atmosphere, the flexibility and friendly service of Luke & Jason (the manager) all receive A plus grades and this is easily one of a few top restaurants in town.  I love this place!!!  Highly recommended for parties upstairs.

Terrible!  This location used to be an Urban Active and the group fitness classes were incredible @ Urban!  Especially the Saturday morning Bootcamp.  This is now run by LA Fitness and it's the worst fitness center I've ever belonged to...maybe it's just this spot that is particularly awful.  After classes being cancelled without notice, sales reps trying to increase my monthly payments, the smoothie bar getting axed, and the pool stinking...I canceled my membership today.  Good-bye LA Fitness in Bakery Square.  You never cared for me!  I'll give you one star only because Larry's Monday night step class kept me in this relationship longer...if it wasn't for Larry I would have dumped you months ago.

Driving down 5th windows down music bumpin on my way to class stopped at a red I pulled up yelp to see where I could pop in and get some grilled chicken quickly. This place catches my yelp eye so I turn on Oakland and spot it.  I noticed its tucked in next to a Chinese spot oh decisions!  Skipped the Chinese and went w my initial plan. I'm unsure if I've ever tried Turkish food but boy oh boy this is delicious!  The spices, the seasoning, the size of the helping, the service, the price, the taste, the "healthier" option all made me extremely happy.  I went for the chicken shish kebabs which came with tomato, pepper, onion, lettuce, cabbage, , bread, and tahikihi sauce.  Simple prep and absolutely flavorful.  I'm lovin this place.

Top place to get salad to go.  Create your own because its the best way to get the toppings you want...lots of choices prepared for you just point as you go...I love it.   My favorite is how they chop the salad to your request personally I like small bites. The citrus vinigrette (may have been lime) is really good and the "salad maker" asks you how much dressing you want...it comes out perfect every time!  I'm such a salad lover!  Wish it was all healthy but I love my cheese.  Not sure who is ordering burgers here I mean really you burger ordering loonies its all about salad here.

Hells yah!  First ever!  Hubs brought these home and we tore them up.  Tried the boneless buffalo red alert and the honey BBQ.  Pure excellence and not weak on the meat at all.  The red alert were stage 3 hot-ness.  They have 2 levels that come hotter.  Plenty spicy on the red alert and let me tell you I can handle the hot stuff.  Not sure on the set up or ambiance but if you are looking for the best boneless in town you just found it here.  Okay?!

really friendly people working here (especially the girl).  her boss, maurice is nice too but she's great!  they treat you right here.  i forgot my credit card today and only brought a debit card.  the girl working here drove me all the way back to my place (I'd walked to pick up the car) to get my credit card and the place was busy.  it's service like this that keeps me coming back to this enterprise location.  the price was a little high today ($52 for one day) but they have some weekend rates that seem reasonable.

Friend introduced me to pita bistro.  Really good!  Yelp, I love the deal you have for free chips and hummus with purchase of a wrap.  I had the chicken shawarma with pickles, toms, lentils, and lettuce.  I loved it!  This would be a regular spot for me if I still lived in Phx.  It's bomb!  Liked the TVs too- oh and there is even a small bar here....price is really great too.  Fresh brewed tea, pita wrap, chips and hummus for 9 bucks.  Beat dhat.
