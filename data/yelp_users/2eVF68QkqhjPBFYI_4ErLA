I just moved back to Arizona from Yokohama, Japan.  While I was there, my wife and I enjoyed Tonkotsu Ramen at a place called Ippudo.  Upon returning to the States, i thought I would never find Tonkotsu Ramen here.  Luckily, we found Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe.  My wife and I could order in Japanse (her native tounge) again and the menu offered something other than sushi!  We had Takoyaki (which was expensive, but good) and Tonkotsu Ramen.  The ramen wasn't perfect, but hey....it's Phoenix!  We will certainly be back.

My wife and I usually go to LGO at about 4:00PM on weekdays, when most of the ridiculous "see and be seen" crowd is gone.  The Commuter Sandwich is good, as is the Cubano.  Luckily, we live close enough to walk...Parking here is tough, I would imagine.  Although it is called a "Grocery", I think "gift shop" would be more appropriate.  They do have a decent cheese display, although overpriced.  Just don't arrive here thinking that you'll be able to buy actual ingredients for everyday cooking.  If you can walk here, it's pretty good.

I'm a fan of J.T.'s.  Reasonable drinks and REALLY good wings.  It's small, so it can get pretty crowded, but the people are friendly, service is good, too.  J.T. 's is a great neighborhood bar, nearly free of any douchebaggery.

Want 2 slices of great pizza and a drink for $5.00?  mama mia is the spot.  That's all there is to it.  Great crispy thin crust 'zah at a great price.  Staff is always friendly and they often remember your name.  Delivery is also fast and friendly.  Pizza is always delivered hot and awesome.  Check it out, if you haven't yet.

It's really easy to write reviews about places like D'licious Dishes.  This was my second visit since Petite Fromage sadly closed.  This time, I was with my mother and wife.  We each ordered a sandwich and a side salad for about $7.00 per person.  Everything was really very good.  I honestly think I would have been satisfied with only half of the cuban sandwich that I ordered, but it was so good, I had to finish it right then and there.  My wife and I are moving into a house in the Medlock Historic District, directly behind D'licious Dishes, and we have decided to make this our standing Saturday lunch spot.  I was too full to indulge in their beautiful selection of sweets, but I will be sure to dive into that area on my next visit.

After doing some shopping nearby, I was lured into ATS by their slogan: "Best Carne Asada in Phoenix".  When ordering at the counter, the staff seemed very disinterested in helping customers.  When I finally did order my carne asada burrito, I was given a number and asked to take a seat.  While I waited, I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter.  When my carne asada arrived at the table, I was starving.  However, the burrito that sat in front of me was tiny.  I'm not really one to complain about small portion sizes, as I feel that most portions are too big, but this portion was just comical.  The burrito was served with a lime wedge that was dry and looked like it had been sliced the day before.  The flavor of the carne asada was bland, as was the texture.  Overall, this was a pretty disappointing meal.   "Best Carne Asada in Phoenix" is a really misleading phrase to have on their sign.  This place is not even close.

I have enjoyed the Parlor for quite some time now, and I can't believe that i have not written a review yet.  We have always received great service and food here.  My two favorite pizzas are the Salsiccia sausage, featuring Schreiner's local sausage,  and the bbq chicken pizza.  They've also always got a seasonal risotto on menu, which is always cooked PERFECTLY, which is a good sign that someone in the kitchen is on the ball.  Go to the Parlor.  Enjoy.

Although i live less than a 5 minute walk from this 7th ave. location, I had shied away from this restaurant due to the so-so reviews here on yelp.  It was difficult to pass up the always awesome D'liscious Dishes, which is next door, but I decided to try it anyway.  I had the Jalapeno Burger, and i was very pleasantly surprised... it was fantastic!   It also came with fries, which were hot and fresh... also very good.    My wife and I shared a dozen hot wings, which were a bit too saucy for me.  The flavor was above average, i thought, but I won't be ordering them again due to the over-saucing. Seating is limited here, so i would avoid this place during busy hours, or plan on taking your order to go.    They don't have fountain drinks; only cans and 2-liter bottles.  Otherwise, the service was quite good and food came out promptly and hot.  i will return, but I'm still weary of the pizza.  Maybe I'll give that a shot sometime and report back with another review.  So far, four solid stars.

Well, I tried the pizza.  I'm sorry to report that it was not good.  a friend described it as "cafeteria pizza" which summed it up pretty well.  I will not take away any stars from my review at this point because the service and other things I have tried here are very good.

Simple, inexpensive, delicious.  Not only are the ingredients fresh, the restaurant clean, and staff friendly, the food speaks for itself.  I was so impressed with the authenticity of the Oxacan food here, that I have been back for more many, many more tacos.  It's rare that this place is slow but when it is, I've had the opportunity to talk a bit with the owner.  He is so enthusiastic about his food, and it shows.  My usual routine is to order my food (I've tried it all, and it's all fantastic) then walk around the corner to the liquor store and get a beer.  By the time I get back to the restaurant, my food is ready and I eat.  Beer + tacos... It's perfect.  The menu is simple and the prices are great.
