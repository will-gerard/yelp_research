Great food!  My BFF and I have decided that we want to eat our way through the menu!  The Caramelized Onion and Blue Cheese Omelet was wonderful  The Pesto Chicken Salad caused my friend to still be rhapsodizing about it two days later...JC, our server, was funny and quick.  Oh, yeah!  I'll be back!

Took a group of 9 business associates to dinner at Ruffino, everyone but me from out of town.  A couple of my guests had been to Ruffino before and were chomping at the bit to go back, because our experiences had been so good.  We were greeted at the door and assured that we would have 2 waitstaff to serve us.  The food was generally pretty good,  but could have been warmer.  The service was another story. Initial drink service was slow. Food service for the appetizers was agonizingly slower.  At one point, because the salad had been sitting on a tray near our table waiting to be served for 6-8 minutes, one of my guests got up and started to serve the salad herself.  The manager came over and started to help her, then the waiter came over to serve the last salad.  My salad had lettuce with lots of brown spots.  We had to ask for drink refills and for bread.  The food was warm, but not hot. We saw one waitress early on, and then the rest of the evening was taken care of by an easily distracted waiter.    This was beginning to be my "go to" place for taking business guests.  Guess I'll be going back to Va Bene.

Great food, especially the Fruit and Nut Waffle, and the Eggs Benedict on Sundays.  Great prices, too!  This is my go-to place for breakfast and lunch since it never disappoints!

Our office just moved to downtown Chandler so we were scoping out the new places for lunch.  This place will on the regular rotation for sure - as in at least once a week I will be there. The Cubano sandwich was probably the best I've had in the valley, But it is the dense, crispy plantain chips called "mariquitas."  The yucca fries were awesome, too.  Our waitress was so friendly and accommodating.  Yep,  I will definitely be back to work my way through the menu.  Lunch for two people with one cola was a VERY reasonable $18.

Native Chicagoan friend and I went there today for lunch.  The fries were hot and crispy and the chili cheese dog was exactly what I have been jonesing for.  Friend has the Italian Beef, wet, with hot peppers.  She was rapturous over the taste!  The Chicago memorabilia was great, too.  Made her homesick.  We are definitely adding this to the list of favorites.
