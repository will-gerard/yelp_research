This place is highly overpriced and over the top. The food was decent, yet indecently priced. If you are going to charge me $15+ for an entree, then don't seat me in a plastic chair that was procured no less than twenty years ago. Maybe it's part of the "charm," but I wasn't impressed, and I will not return unless the prices on the menu fall to fares that fit the flare.   For the appetizer, I ordered the beef empanadas. Having traveled to Argentina, I know a good empanada. Havana's meat filled pasty left something to be desired - not enough spice and too greasy.   For the entrees, I ordered the fried chicken and the paradise pulled pork. Both came with black beans and rice. The beans were good - blended with onions and cilantro. The rice was as plain as Jane. I found the chicken to be quite good. I liked the corn starch dusted coating and the overall flavor and moistness of the chicken. The paradise pulled pork was mediocre, at best. While the price was jacked to the max, the portion sure was not. I've had better tasting carnitas for half as much.   I love when a restaurant leaves me excited to come back and try some more, and sadly Havana Cafe has not done that for me.

This place is extremely sub par for a place that specializes in tacos. I'm pretty sure that they use canned chicken for their tacos & burritos and London broiled low-grade beef (which they try to pass of as carne asada). All in all, I could make their menu at home and have it taste better. The prices are cheap so I guess that you get what you pay for; however, I could get a much better tasting burrito at Chipotle or a local Filiberto's type of restaurant for the same price. I've given this place two chances to change my mind and my feelings have only solidified.

Thai E-San serves the best Thai food I've eaten anywhere. I've never been to Thailand, but it's clear that the owners care very much about bringing the authentic flavor of Thailand to its guests. The food is always fresh and consistent. I became addicted to many things on the menu and went twice per week for quite some time. I've since moved away and miss Thai e-San every day. The owners and the servers are such wonderful people, and they take the time to get to know you and remember all of the details. I never had to ask for special things I like, they just always knew. The ingredients are perfect and they handle each superbly. The spices they use to heat the dish are unlike any other place and they know the perfect balance of chili oil, paste, and powder/seeds and how to match it to the dish. The meats always taste fresh and take on the flavor of the dish whereas many other places cook the meat separately or overcook it. If you're looking for authentic, fresh, and friendly then this is your place!
