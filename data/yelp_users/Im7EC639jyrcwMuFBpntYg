I have eaten there about 5 times in the past two years. I have always gone for lunch and have always had the same thing - pulled pork and Cole slaw sandwich - so maybe my review won't be helpful for people wanting feedback on other dishes. But the service was fast and friendly the the food outstanding.

I love the Tuscan tomato and the meatball pannini

I am not getting the negative reviews, especially the one who claimed it wasn't "authentic (think Panda Express)."  The food is always fresh, the people are always friendly, and I always leave satisfied.

I was so excited when they opened up a mile from my house but the service at this location is terrible. Twice in the past three weeks we placed a takeout order. They said it would be ready in an hour. When we showed up - both times!! - we were told that they were out of one of the dishes we ordered. They didn't bother to call us (even though they took our number when we placed the order) and just said "Sorry. We're out of that. Do you want something else?" Yeah. I would like a phone call, like an hour ago telling me what was up. Can I have that? Love the food but it's not worth the crappy service and bad "oh well"!attitude.

It's a small, family run restaurant that offers good food at reasonable prices. The service is fast and friendly. The location they are in has had a number of tenants come and go over the years so I really hope this place stays in business for a long time.

I like the atmosphere and the super hero theme. The bar is nice and there's always sports on.
