Umpteen times checked in here, that means its good :) It's a very good value for the money (about $30 for 2 people). You get fresh baked bread, salad or soup, entree, drink and spumoni. For me, i get salad with gf dressing, gf pasta, i have to skip all the other stuff but its fine by me, that is alot of food.  I set up to get text messages for deal, they normally run one on Wednesday and Sundays. Buy one get one free. You really can't beat that.  We recommend Old Spaghetti Factory.

This is another place we order food from and have it delivered to work. I am hooked on the Chef's Julienne Salad. Sliced ham, turkey, american & swiss cheese, boiled egg, peppers, onion, tomato & cucumbers on lettuce..........................................................................................................$7.35 How i order mine...No Peppers, Add Bacon and a Pickle spear. Comes with pita bread and a cookie, both i cannot eat because of my Gluten Intolerance issue.  We order from Athenians Express a few times a month and generally speaking, i think that everyone is pretty happy with their orders. Salads are huge, but i manage to eat it all!  I suggest getting some gluten free cookies :)  I recommend Athenians Express! :)

I really like the Celebrity Theatre, Its a quaint, intimate place to see a show. Love the rotating stage, everybody gets a good seat that way. Parking has gotten alot better, its all paved in the back, but could use more lighting , i know i would feel better about that for theft and safety reasons, Parking $5. Every concert i have seen here has been packed. I generally will make sure i don't need to use the potty, go before i leave the house, bathroom line is long and i really really long and smelly (girls are gross).  Want to mention seating is a bit tight, knees right up against the seat in front of you. I could see the seats being renovated.  People keep saying "This place is a dump", its not a dump, its Vintage, a Classic, Historical its 50 Years Old!  All the greats have played there, look at the history on the walls. Just relax and enjoy the show. I recommend seeing a show here. Will i be back? You bet i will!

This review is for Zoo Lights! This year is way better than last year. They have added so much. I love that things have been changed up. Keeps it new and exciting. I do however want to mention that i wish that some work would be done on the light show they do on the water, i think it could use something a bit boring. When we go, we normally hit it on the very last day, its a way to end the holiday's. We like to make two laps around the park.  Park is nice and clean and plenty of trash cans around to help keep it that way. Great place to see some pretty Christmas lights. We go every year and will be back this year too!

This is the 2nd year we have come to the Pointe In Tyme for Christmas Buffet. Let me mention how beautiful the decorations and displays are and the lit fireplace really sets the mood for our holiday dinner. The Buffet was almost identical to previous year in nearly all ways including price at just under 50 a person.  Just like the previous year, excellent service, great overall display, the cheese tray, main meal choices like the lamb were excellent, and nice grilled asparagus and broccolini, very good brussell sprouts , and port loin. Deserts could probably be improved in quality as what was on display was a bit dry and unoriginal looking. Also, just like last year they offered Creme brulee on the advertising but unless you knew that and asked for it no one was going to tell you about it. I am a huge fan of creme brule, that is the whole reason we really choose to come here for our Christmas dinner.

I don't eat here, normally, but i was in the mood for so buffalo wings. I stopped to get two different kinds of wings. I wanted honey bbq and mild wings. This was  Disappointing. I realize they offer a gluten free pizza, but from what i understand its from Gluten Creations and i really don't like that crust, so that is out.  The two stars was for the customer service. They gave me a drink and offered free bread sticks while i waited. Thought that was nice.  Although they were really friendly here, i can't see why we needed to make a second attempt.   Dear Rick P.  I didn't eat the breadsticks because of my allergies, did have some water while I waited.  I wasn't planning on getting a pizza that night, just the wings, but I was told previously that your crust was gluten creations, my mistake.  The 2 stars are for the disappointing wings.  They were really bad.  And your third comment, "we, as in me and my family" don't feel we need to try Streets of New York

Every single time we have been to Eribertos, its been delicious, in fact, as i sit here writing you, i am craving it! We have been to many "bertos" but this is the best!.  I like the #2, two shredded beef tacos with rice and beans, love it. My Alex likes the Chorizo, Egg, Potato and Cheese Breakfast Burrito.  Not sure what is up with some of the other reviews, but we really love their food here at this location. With the other 4/5 star reviews, you have great taste. You get it.  They have made many changes by adding a nice outdoors patio to eat at and two drive-thru windows. That's how busy they are. We will be back and i strongly suggest you try it, i think you will like it.

---------Located in the Sprouts shopping center------- We normally rent from this location. They are quick and efficient.  Employees are relatively the same, not a huge turnover, that is nice because as often as we rent cars it nice to deal with the same people. We recommend renting from Avis

Outstanding experience, Jennifer did a great job. I had 3 inches taken off, it needed a refresher that's for sure.  I got in 30 min early and she went ahead and took me when i walked in. Salon is really nice, clean and the atmosphere was inviting.  Back to Jennifer, she was polite, pleasant and helpful with suggestions.  I loved how excited she got when she said She wanted to color my hair, although she raved about my "virgin" hair. I'm actually pretty proud of that. I see they do waxing and Mani/Pedi's, something to keep in mind.  I rely on Yelp! A lot.  Thank you Yelp for your guidance, once again.

Very nice girls, clean salon and quick service.  If you pay with cash, you get a 5% discount. If you pay with debit, you can't add a tip to the charge, so be sure to bring cash.   I counted 17 people working today, very busy on the weekend, I dropped in with no appointment and got right in, 1 hour later, fresh mani/pedi in Lincoln Park After Dark (my favorite color).  Go here!

This is our 3rd year coming to Gallagher's for Super Bowl game. On occasions we will stop in for lunch. Generally speaking, they have pretty good food. The service is really good. The owner, i think he's the owner, we see him every time we come in and he is always checking on us even after our server has been by. I really like the hands interaction he has with Gallagher's, to me that says alot. Last night i ordered my Kobe burger med-well, it was more like rare, there was no way i was eating that. The owner came by and asked how we were doing and i asked if they could cook it more, i wanted med-well. No problem, he said. Everything else was really good. I had a bloody mary that was really good. Friendly, happy employees. Good place to go if you like off track betting and lots of tv's, drinking and entertaining groups of people.

Five Stars! They always know Kenny and they are so great with him.  They understand our sporadic phone calls to check on him when he is there for a visit. We have been coming here for years, with my Alex's prior doggies and he just loved it so now that we have our Kenny, now for just over a year, he has been doing just great here. Our Kenny is a Chow mix and doesn't play well with others, so he gets his very own outside time. We love the special attention he gets and he just loves people.  When we bring Kenny in we bring his wet food in portion size baggies for his AM/PM feeding mixed with their 1/2 cup of dry. They are fabulous at follow our strict instructions regarding his diet. Kenny also gets groomed here. As i mentioned before, he is a Chow and he has lots of fur and needs extra special time to make him look pretty.  They are so good with him and taking their time with him.  Kenny always looks so cute and smells good. Thank you for always putting our mind at ease and taking such good care of our Kenny. Kenny says thank you too! We recommend bringing your pet to Boulder Falls!

Hi Readers,  On a Saturday we took one of our cars into AAA to have an issue fixed, We wanted the car there to be looked at first thing Monday morning. It took some time to figure out what the problem really resided, but that was fine with us, we were in no hurry. We picked us the car on Wednesday. Service was great. very polite and professional. We have an unusual car and not alot of mechanics know how to work on it.  There is a discount for being a AAA member and have been for many years. They have a shuttle to take you home or pick you up.  A lot of people don't know they actually have a few locations that provide Auto Repair.  Not just for your travels and tow trucks.  We don't look forward to car problems again, but if we do, we will bring it back to AAA Arizona.

I had a fantastic experience at the Paradise Eye inside of the Lenscrafters with Bessie Quack, OD.  They were able to get me in the same day for an eye exam.  Very quick and thorough with the exam, She was super sweet and knowledgeable, i didn't feel rushed what so ever.  The store carries designer frames which I like that I can get Ray Bans,Gucci, Prada, Fendi, or any other designer there.   Nick helped me choose glasses, this time i went with a pair of regular glasses with no tin and a second pair of sunglasses. I am super excited to get them.  I am writing this review before actually receiving my glasses because of the great experience i had.  Nick was knowledgeable and really cute and really young, lol  His help with choosing my glasses was fun.   They have this really precise way of measuring your prescription on your glasses by contraption attached to the glasses that has pinpoints on it and they take a picture of you wearing them, this technique made me feel at ease with them getting things just right.  I recommend this loctation.

Stella the Sales Manager was fabulous, professional and caring to my needs. I came back to switch out my sunglasses, i was unhappy with the fit and didn't think that they could be adjusted any further, because that was what i was told, it would change my prescription.  Stella fixed me all up and made me feel more at ease that i still need to take the 30 days to get use to using progressive lenses. She also said that if you don't have them fit right your perception will not be right,   Stop wearing your old glasses, no switching back and forth, a big no no.  Wear your glasses high and close, the position will maximize the range of visibility. Move your head, Not your eyes. Point your nose directly at what you want to see, bring it into focus by moving your chin up and down.  Be Patient. Your brain needs  time to acclimate.   Its now been a few weeks and she was right, it's all better, everything fell into place and both pairs of my glasses fit perfectly, very comfortable. I do recommend this location of Lens Crafters. Thank you, Stella for helping me cope with Progressive Lenses!

We really like to spend a few hours at Turf Paradise, do a little gambling, eat some lunch and look at all the beautiful horses.  We like to buy Great Deal on a Turf Club & Clubhouse Racing Package for Two on Living Social.   Go to www.livingsocial.com and search for Turf Paradise  Or www.Groupon.com will also have specials.  The Club House has really good food and its casual dining. Menu items range from $6.50 to $13.00. reservations are recommended by calling 602-375-6470.  We always have a good time when we go. We recommend trying something new, go bet a few dollars on horse, you might win!

This location is pretty close to home, we see alot of movies and this venue is one we go to often. Every year we start the year off with a brand new Loyalty cup $5.25, refills are a $1.50.  We don't generally get this special, but probably should...2015 Loyalty T-shirt  Receive a FREE medium popcorn every time you wear your Loyalty T-shirt to the movies through the end of 2015. *Harkins Theatres donates $1.00 to Phoenix Children's Hospital for each Loyalty T-shirt sold. I love this!  I recommend Harkins because they offer several screens, comfortable seats and friendly employees, and plenty of fresh hot popcorn.

We stayed here roughly, 5 months ago... This review was a combination from both my Alex and I. There were pros and cons to this experience. Certainly the pale is kind of a historic remnant and very quaint. It's about 8 miles south of Florence, out in the well... desert. There isn't anything else of note immediately around the place. The small group of individual rooms around a courtyard or the more pricey Casitas are your choices. We were in the Alamo room of the courtyard, which featured a painting of the Alamo in Texas under siege and a few Alamo related books on the shelves. The room and grounds are very attractively kept up and nice to wander a bit. The room was very nicely decorated, though i found all the chairs uncomfortable to sit in even though they looked nice. The bed was the same.. very stiff and uncomfortable to sleep on.. but it looked nice. The biggest problem for us was the hot room. The ac was on low when entering but still even at full force only late at night did it get a bit more comfortable and that was only under the AC blower directly.   The bathroom was hot and humid as the AC air never made the corner back around the the bath area. Really probably needed a wind AC unit in the bathroom or a re think of the general AC unit. No granted this was Arizona summer and even the hostess was not interested in talking about the weather, and most of these reviews and probably most of their business is in winter.  That being said most people won't care in the winter months about the poor AC which made sleeping difficult with the uncomfortable bed. Add in that the refrigerator did not work and the ice machine was broken as well as a non working soda machine and well.... you get the picture wasn't much of a way left to cool off. I'm sure the basic continental breakfast was fine for most people as well.. i must say the breakfast area was very nicely decorated... oh and cool compared to the room. No didn't complain of this but felt very much so that the owners preferred not to be disturbed after six pm. so... we have in summer a very nicely appointed in general room and grounds.. but very hot and stuffy room with a hard mattress, hot bathroom, no working fridge nor ice machine nor soda machine that worked.  We commend staying in this  place in the winter months because it is much cooler.

Big Fan! Its been years since we have been to McCormick.  We went to ride the train and see the Christmas lights. Line was really really long but let me tell you, the line moves really fast, and only $3 to ride, fun for all ages! The Christmas decorations were so cute.  There is a Model Train Exhibit, what a great display of trains. How fun it would be to have these trains and run them all day long, showing them off. These guys really out done themselves.  Going to make this part of our yearly tradition around the holiday's

Fountain Hills has the world's fourth tallest fountain. I have been coming to see this fountain since i moved to Arizona in 1974, great memories for me. Many reasons to come to see the fountain and the area, there are annual fairs,  Those are always fun, love the art shows.  I suggest bringing anyone that visits Arizona see the the fountain, day or night is just beautiful!

We have been here several times over the past couple of years. We really like it here. we have seen "A Christmas Carol, the musical", twice now, You're a Good Man Charlie Brown.  Seating is really comfortable. Everyone that works there is super nice.  Its a drive for us to get out to the theatre but its worth it to come out and see some really great people entertain us.  Great place around to eat as well, dinner and a show then go see the one of the tallest fountains in the world. We recommend catching a show here.

We have been here several times, this last time to see Bill Maher. I liked this theater because it is not too huge or too small, it's intimate. I don't think there is a bad seat in the house. We recommend this theater to anyone looking for a good show!

I haven't eaten at the actual deli, because we normally order out and have it delivered at work. They do a fabulous job getting it right every time. I am hooked on "The Jazz" i get it with gluten free bagel or whatever kind of bread they have that is gf and they toast is so its really good with the cream cheese on it. Every sandwich comes with a cookie that is not gluten free so i just give it way, but if they want bonus points from me, they could figure out how to get me a gf cookie, i sure would appreciate it, lol  We want to thank you for feeding us, we have happy tummies and can continue working the rest of our day.   I recommend Sacks!

I brought my son here for some glasses, our first time here. Looking for some where to go to get the best deal for him. 2 Pairs of Glasses $78 or BOGO on Designer Glasses My son, we will call him Corey, is pretty happy far as i know with his glasses. The exam was pretty fast and thorough. Corey was able to make his appointment and get in the same day. He chose his glasses and got them within a few days. No appointment need to the glasses pick up and adjustment. We picked up the additional insurance on them just in case. Hopefully we won't need to use it but if we do, i will update my review with how that went.  Overall, we are pretty happy and we will be back, if that is the route that Corey wants to go.

Love love love this place! We usually spend a couple of hours here when we come and im always the lager behind, i have to see everything and still not see it all. My ultimate favorite thing to do is look at the teapots, i love to see if i can guess the maker. Always in search of a James Sadler Teapot, can you guess why? The only thing i don't really like is the glass cases, you can't touch the items and when you ring the bell for service, they never come. I generally give up after 5 minutes of waiting then move on, for that, i bring it the stars down to 4. Fun way to spend an afternoon, we will be back!

We have been to Mesa Arts Center several times, we have see Chrissie Hynde (amazing!) and Todd Rundgren (unbelievable!) , to name a few shows we have seen here.  Really nice theater.  Parking cost like $5, but we normally park on the street for free, short walk.  We really enjoy coming to this venue for some shows, we travel from North Phoenix. We will be back!

Cute community theater. We have been here twice. Once to see Footloose, and this last time to see Splitting Gears, both were fabulous shows. Friendly staff and volunteers. The seating is comfortable. Intermission, snacks and drinks available.  We look forward to seeing another show here in the future.

We have been to this venue, just a few times.  Not exactly close, we live in north phoenix.  The Security was insane and the strictness for the cameras caused some problems with our camera.  Outdoors amphitheater style seating. makes for great sound and the lush grassy area looks nice. I would not go to a show here in the summer. Minus a star for cost, water alone is almost $4. Minus a star for the insane security.  This venue is not on the top of my list.

We go to Blue Agave ALL the time. Food is great. Let me tell you, if you check in with Yelp! there is always a coupon available or you can go to Living Social or Double Take and buy a offer from them. We never not have some kind of deal when we go.  Chips are thin, i love thin chips and the salsa is like a chipotle salsa, love that too. They offer a great gluten free menu. I am hooked on their Carne Asada Rice Bowl. I also love their spicy boneless pork ribs, there is so much meat and the flavor is out of this world, comes with rice and your choice of black beans, pinto beans or refried beans, flour or corn tortillas, i choose corn because of the gf thing. I'm told by my Alex that Ultimate chimichanga are delicious.  There is a full service bar and a huge list of tequilas to choose from. Get on their email list and they will send you offers there too and updates on up coming events, like Blood Mary specials, yum, they have good ones :) We recommend giving Blue Agave a shot.

Love love love Good China! We use to live here in Peoria, just down the street from Good China. We started coming years ago. They understand and accommodate me for my special gluten allergy.  I really love the Singapore rice noodle, you can order is mild or hot. Free hot tea, although, they charge for iced tea, tea is tea hot or cold, just sayin. Probably the best egg drop soup i have ever had. We don't live in Peoria anymore, but we don't mind driving over because its our favorite! I have my family hooked too.  Very clean and nice atmosphere.  I really don't get some of these negative reviews, as many times as we have been here, i have zero complaints.  They are good with Groups too! Full service bar and they are always really busy with take out orders. I especially like that they remember us when we come in.  Making me hungry right now!

Super close to the house, I go here for my shipping. This location must have a high turnover, i don't think i have seen the same person twice. Thinking this must be a boring job, employees seem to be non energetic and just blah about things. When at all possible, i try not to go to this location or hit the Post Office that is also close to my house. Be happy, you have a job!

I always go to Discount Tire. This is my first time at this location. Very busy and came in without an appointment, due to a flat tire. I wanted to replace my tire with the exact same brand tire i have on my car, must be the same, lol They didn't have my tire in stock but was able to have it shipped for the following day. They gave me a loaner until then. That worked out just fine.  To bad the waiting room smells like brand new tires, but they offer free bottles of water while you wait.  They are pretty fast, move them in and move them out! Will always be back to Discount Tire.

Yelp reviews did it again! The ratings were tops, we just had to try it. Because of my Gluten allergies i noticed they didn't really have anything i could eat that was Greek on their menu, so i went with what i knew i could eat. I had a hamburger with fried egg on top, minus bun. My burger was savory and my Fries were cooked perfectly. My Alex had the gyro, said it was probably one of the best he has ever had. The next time we are passing threw Superior, we will stop here for lunch

Oh how do i do rate and review Bright Now Dental???   I have had 26 check-ins with Bright Now Dental, thats not really all of them, orthodontics takes alot of appointments, lol Really nice staff,and they are always trying to do the right thing. 5 stars for that!  Their over booking appointments and time delay brings the stars down. The mass confusion my account also brings the stars down. The confusion with my dental plan also brought it down. How do i go into detail about this without telling a really long story, i'm not. Its actually my business and not yours, this happen to me and i hope it won't happen to you. I think that i slipped through the loop holes and hit every branch on the way down.  I believe that everyone deserves a second chance and i really believe that they are really trying at this location.  Jennifer the office manger has really gone out of her way to make everything right with my case. I really appreciate that. This being said, She brings the stars up!  Only time will tell and maybe bring the stars up even more.i would like to do another review or add to this one when its all said and done. I hope its a good ending.

This Costco location is the Best, totally better then the one at Arrowhead mall, and you know why. The location is right off the 101, easy access.   This Costco had a tire store, i personally get my tires at Discount tire, so i don't know how they are with that... and gas station, great prices , the lines move really fast. I would however like to see them have paper towels handy for spillage. I would like to give them props for getting more and more gluten free items. Would love it even more if they had Gluten Free Pizza at their deli, I would buy that for sure! Really friendly employees. Very clean store and always have samples available. I can always get in and out pretty fast.

This last time we were here, was 3 months ago for my nieces birthday party with all her girlfriends. Started off in the bowling alley area, which is located on the lower level. My sister got bowling for the girls (12), endless amounts of pitchers of soda, hamburgers, chicken bites and french fries. I don't know if that is a package or not but i know they have other packages, see attached pdf i found. The was plenty of attention from the servers and very helpful with getting the bowling started. The girls had a really good time, i know my sister is really glad that she chose Dave & Busters. After the bowling the girls ran upstairs to use the coins we gave them. They had a blast and even more fun trying to decide what to get with all of their tickets they got.  4 stars because the cost of this place was nuts. They have a pretty good racket going on here, the kids love it! This place is great for groups of people, and lots of kids.

Normally shop Safeway stores, specifically this location and usually have great service. This particular  time was not so good. Im at the register and the clerk checking me out was fighting with the lady that had the clipboard, i guess she was running the front end of the store, some kind of manage. The lady with the clipboard moved down to an empty checkout stand and was writing things down and kept looking over and the clerk ringing me up, started complaining  about the manager saying she is mean, i said you shouldn't be telling me all this. She said why? I said, its wrong to be doing this in front of customers. I left, walked by the lady with the clip board and said, that whole thing just made me feel really uncomfortable, she was like, what, we were just kidding, I said, oh really, didn't see like it to me. You should have heard the things she was telling me about you. She really didn't care. I just had to leave.  I probably shouldn't have said anything anyway, but i just couldn't help myself. I have worked with the public, you can't be have like that.  I'll be back, because i like Safeway and this could have been just a one time thing, generally, the staff is very friendly and helpful and clean.

We really like Black Bear Diner, Im with another guy's review i read..."You won't regret it, unless you over indulge with their HUGE portions". This is so true.   I love that they have flavored non-dairy creamer for my coffee. I generally get breakfast or lunch, yet to try dinner, only because there is less for me to choose from dinner part of the menu. I have to chose wisely since i am Gluten Intolerant.  The 4 stars is for not having gluten free bread.  There is always a huge line of people coming and going in the waiting area. If you are lucky, you can sit next to the big stuffed bear while waiting for your table, Ha! Our servers are always great and we have no complaints. We will come back and you should give this a try, many locations, even out of state and we have tried those too.

I moved to Arizona in 1974, long time ago!  I saw my first concert here, Kiss at the Coliseum. We don't come to the fair anymore to ride the rides but to see some concerts during Fair time. We like to walk around when the shows are over and ride the only ride i will get on, the Midway ride. Nice view from up there, you can see the whole city!   There is so much to do; concerts, rodeo, rides, exhibits, farm animals, something with cars and mud. Lots of shopping and food. Not alot of gluten free options, that  i've seen anyway.  This place is a historic landmark. As long as their line up of concerts are something that we are interested in, we will be back this October.

This Farmers Market is really close to home, love getting up early to get a head start on my day.   Organic, fresh eggs, vegetables, flowers, Queen Creek Olive Oil, fruit and lets not forget the Hatch Green Chilies from Taste of Taos, he roasts them right there, man this last bunch was HOT!  We support Buy Local!  Parking can be a bear but if you pull in right next to the tennis courts your chances to finding a good spot to park is better.

It was my first time here. We decided to take a more scenic route to Tucson. I have never been to Casa Grand, Coolidge nor Superior.  Very nice piece of history...I'm glad we stopped.  Make sure you go early enough in the day, it gets hot! $5 per person to get in.

The prices were reasonable. The seats are comfortable and the movie quality was great. I suggest buying the Loyalty Cup, refills are only $1.00. Popcorn is always fresh.They have a large variety of food.  Bathrooms are kept very clean.  We really enjoy this theater. We recommend this theater.

Hair cut by Rafael. He is such a nice guy, im over the having bangs and growing them out. Its a very awkward process, Rafael listens to my needs and helpful with suggestions, he does such a great job and is very particular.  They are not pushers of products here, but do explain everything they use in there your hair and why, so you can buy anything you want without feeling pressured.   I'll Be Back (in my Arnold Schwarzenegger voice)

This place was amazing! The staff was wonderful, our desserts were heavenly! We came just for dessert because they have my very favorite dessert in the whole wide world, Creme Brulee! The food being served around us tells me, we will be back for dinner and dessert in the near future.  Loved the owners and all the staff, i enjoyed watching them work. I don't understand the comments on the Rudeness? I didn't get that from them.  Like to mention that when i Yelp! Cafepino and read reviews, this made me understand how important it is to include pictures. I am making more of an effort to submit pictures in all my reviews.

This is the second time here, loved it! Specifically, my food was outstanding. They had the ability to make homemade gluten free pasta, just for me. The texture of the pasta was dead on to regular pasta.  Speaking for everyone else dining with my, they really enjoyed the food and service. Creme  brûlée completed my perfect meal.  We will be back!

This is a shame to find out that the Coffee Bean uses powders in their espressos. These powders contain "wheat" which means it is not gluten free.. They  told me they had nothing there that was gluten free. That's not good. Im done with The Coffee Bean. That's too bad, they need to get in the NOW, like many others that accommodate people that have health restrictions. I do however like to mention that they do offer a non-dairy creamer, yay, its a start for my other issue. Its not just me...Plenty of people out there have all kinds of allergies and are developing health issues, alot of which is cause by the way food is processed these days, i am convinced of this, i was not always gluten intolerant nor dairy intolerant.  I digress. They do offer water and some soda's in a can and regular coffee with non dairy creamer. But i still won't support a company that puts all that other jazz into espressos, lattes or frappuchino, so i won't be back.

Great place to do it yourself or pay them to do it for you.   I paid $22 to wash my pup pup. Place has it all, and is super clean.   They give you the rundown on how it  works and walks you back to your station. You get a ramp for your doggie to walk up to get into the tub, they will help with that if you need.   Here's what you get: a basket of brushes, combs and a special rubber brush to use when you are washing you doggie. You get nail clippers, hand towels, regular  size towels, a sham (use first to get all the water off, then use towels and then blow dryer). Hypoallergenic shampoo and conditioner. Ear and eye cleaner and cologne spritz.  They supply the long apron you need to wear, cuz you do get wet, lol  This was my fist time in, I will be back and highly recommend. After all, I couldn't do what I did at home with the time involved to set it up and do the task, and clean up and I think I was there like 1.5 hours and I'm done and my pup pup looks great, smells great and it was painless considering it was a first for the both of us.  They have rewards also, buy I think 4 washes, get the 5th free, something like that, what a deal.

First time here.  I had the "The John Wayne Omelet". Ham, sausage, bacon, and Cheese. served with potatoes and toast. I also had coffee with non dairy flavored creamer. My Alex had the "Cheese" Omelet. Cheese blend, provolone, Havarti, feta, Swiss or mozzarella. Served with potatoes and toast. He had Ice Tea. Really good food here, service as great and the restaurant was immaculate. We were here on a Sunday, only open till 3:00 pm.  We'd like to come back and try lunch some time :)

When we are in the area of Fountain Hills, we Always eat here. They have gluten free red sauce enchiladas, I love them.  We have been to the other location as well in Cave Creek. The food here is so good and many things to choose from that is gluten free.  We have never had bad service here. Chips are nice and thin and three different sauces are really tasty.  They have outside seating and when its in the cooler days, they have space heaters all over. I especially liked it outside because there is a chef out there preparing all kinds of things on the grill. You know that smell, it just pulls you in. That's pretty smart selling point, lol I recommend trying one of El Encanto locations, the food is Delicioso!

I went to the doctor on a Wednesday, they gave a prescription for a compound. With my prescription came with a referral to get it filled at Potter's House that is right next door to them. I would say that was convenient for me.  I also thought, they probably recommend them with all their patients and get a kickback for doing so. Getting back on track, i gave the girl at the front desk my prescription to be filled, she took all my information and asked if i would like to get a text when my prescription is filled, i thought, okay, but i'm just going to be here anyways waiting for it . She said that it will be 24-48 hours to fill it. I'm shocked, i asked why and  she said they have to make it. okay, they "specialize" in compounding, right? The building is huge. I still can't get beyond the fact it's going to take that long. I need my relief today please.  Here is their hours Monday - Friday 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., Closed weekends, I got my text that my prescription was ready at 2:30 pm Monday.  Let's talk about the front counter, they have two registers, which i thought was to close together. This lady next to me, i felt like i was invading her and vice verse, no privacy.   Apparently, i don't know how this works.     Maybe someone should explain how this place works from the very beginning.    With my insurance, i paid $60  I suggest, if you can find somewhere else to go with better hours and can get your prescription faster, do it!  Proceed with caution if you don't know how these compounding pharmacy's work.

I am a fan of this location of Albertsons   Albertsons seems to be the only place i can find Arm & Hammer woman's deodorant.  I like the unscented kind, but  they didn't have that one this time, as you can see in the pic i took. Super nice, friendly, helpful employees, always happy to help.

No waiting... It was pedi day with sister, have been here a few times, the girls here do a good job.  I chose the #2 which was a regular pedi with a 15 min cucumber lotion leg message, Hannah was attentive to my needs, she did fabulous job! The salon was really clean and looked sterile, that's a good thing, i like to know that the utensils and foot-bath they use on me are clean. I like that they use a punch card here, i don't make it over on this side of town very often, so my sis gets my punches. Next time Sister wants to go get nails done, im game!

Up to date 3D mammography.   Everyone is very nice and helpful to help your all the way. I loved the beautiful mirrors and rooms and colors make it a warm calming process.  Today i had my a 6 month follow-up. Because I needed additional images and an ultra sound done, everything was explained as we went along.   it was determined that i needed a stereotactic core biopsy .   That was scheduled right away and the process was pretty fast.  Everything turned out very well for me.  Just so you know, when you have a biopsy done, they will tag you with a titanium clip. radiologist explained they were putting a clip in to "mark" it. They ended up doing a brief mammo after to make sure they could see it and it was in the right place. He told me its purpose was for future mammograms, so they would know this mass had been biopsied. Also, on the very slim chance it turned out they needed to do anything further on it they know how to find it. Its like the size of an eyelash.   Breast exams saves lives I feel that it is fair to give all 5 stars for my expeince.

Always friendly, always quick, always helpful. Today i had my cute little VW Beetle serviced. He said the wait time was about 2 hours, it was more like 45 min. When i handed over my keys, he said, "we will also check the recall"  He hit the recall before i had a chance to mention it. That was impressive,  Waiting area is clean and provides free popcorn, coffee with flavored non-dairy creamer,  donuts, apples and snack bars also free water bottles. Lets not forget, large screen tv and free wi-fi.  I am very pleased with choosing Lunde's Volkswagen, my lease is up in 1 more year and i WILL lease from here again

We generally come here for the shows. We aren't gamblers. We have however eaten at a few of the restaurants.  Here a few shows we have seen; Jerry Riopelle, Todd Rundgren, Deep Purple, The Tubes and more... Seating is not the best, there is no incline to see, its all flat and if your short like me, its difficult. I'm typically not the one that chooses what shows we see here, that would be my expert Alex, his love of music won't stop him seeing some shows.  We will be back, they seem to have a lot of shows we are interested in.

Waitress needs the info about gf. I asked if they offer anything gf, she said 'anything with a gf next to it, I don't even know what gf means, lol". I told her she should learn what is, its on your menu.i know, that sounded bitchy, I just thought she should better informed. I think that was embarrassing for her to admit that to a customer.  Iced tea was extremely weak.  The chips come in a huge bucket, that was something i have never seen before, was cool.We did not like either of the salsa's, bland.  The sweet potato fries were soggy and limp. I had a burger with no bun, the burger had great flavor. I also had a bloody Mary, that was super hot and i like hot but this was really hot.

Who doesn't love Chipotle?!  I am a creature of habit, i like the same thing when i come here, rice, beans and steak. We both can eat for under $20, that's with us sharing a large drink and chips & salsa.  I would love it if they had a drive-thru for the times one of us is pickin up.  There is generally a long line, but it moves pretty fast.  We go to this location fairly often and I notice that the staff seems to turn over a lot, just mentioning that. I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing. Food is consistently good.  I have read some reviews where they say their burrito was made wrong, how is that possible when you are standing right there watching them make it right in front of you. They would have fixed it for you. They are always generous with their portions too.   We will be back :)

Order To Go...12 mild wings, 12 bbq wings, great tasting. However, i will go with medium, needs more fire.  The only thing i want to mention is, their are the drumettes and wing parts, right?  out of the 24 wings, there was 5 drummettes and the rest was wings. I eat the wing parts and my Alex like the dummettes. We perfer it to be more equal since we are sharing.  We have never eating here but the ambience on the patio looks very comfortable. Maybe next time we will have to try that before it gets to warm out.

I have been wanting to go to this place for a year now. The ladies all rave about it at work. Hidden Gem, they say, hidden, yes, i have driven by this place several times and if you didn't have it on google map, forget it, lol It was cute with lots to look at, trinkets, jewelry, decor with a broad range of eclectic store.  stole this from a review i had read, it was well put... I was instantly put off by all of the religious items and crucifix displays - as if we are all chri$tian. This Gay/Atheist walked out after the third shop. Thank you Mike. M

We have been coming here on and off for a few years now and this location is the one we generally go to .  I really like the fact that i can control what i put in my bowl.  The only gripe i have is the way the line up is with all the items to create your own bowl, its always hard to reach and always a mess.  They offer white rice, brown rice, fried rice, plus rice noodles, wheat noodles, i like sticking with the brown rice. If you have never been here before, they will walk you threw it, but basically you choose your bowl size and everything you want in it. They cook it up and the server brings it to you. Sign up for the Genghis Grill card and give them your email, you will always get specials sent to you.

The reviews that are on here are for the frisbee golf course. I don't play, but i do enjoy watching them.  I like the park because its so close to home. Our pup pup really likes to walk out there. Many bushes for him to potty on and believe me, he tries to hit them all. He has an amazing bladder, lol Many people also run and the ride their bikes on paths. This is a well respected park, meaning its pretty clean for a desert park, I don't know the golf part etiquette, but you can just tell, that it is taken care of with rock formations and whatnot.  Please check out my pictures i posted.

Amazing atmosphere, energetic employees that were super and fun to watch their interaction with each other, seem to have their own little world.   Service was fast and really on top of keeping my Alex's iced tea filled, that's hard to do with Alex, he drinks alot of tea. They get points for that. I checked into the gluten free options and they didn't have a menu but he did say that their red sauce was made with corn starch, somehow i wasn't completely  convinced so i went safe and went with a taco salad minus the flour tortilla shell, i really enjoyed that, next time i will add green onions, the only thing missing.  I can't remember what my Alex had but here's a picture, it looks really good, huh? I miss eating things like that. Salsa was really hot and i thought the red sauce had tons of flavor, i sided with the red over the green.  We will eat here again, food was delicious!

We are big fans of Sprouts and specifically this location. Use to be Sunflower Market, miss that too. Love the gluten free options here, i can always find the hard to find items here. Their products are high quality. Great selection of vegetables and fruit from local growers. Bulk bins are filled with everything you might want and the quantity you want. Vitamins, Supplements, hair products to soaps and makeup. Freshly ground  coffee beans to homemade peanut butter.  You can order sandwiches from the deli and they make them anyway you want, they can even accommodate a gluten free request if you like, which impressed me, since i am gluten free.

We have been here a few time, really hard getting in, expect a line because its that good.  I have had their  Chop-N-Chick; eggs and pesto pork chop, let me tell you, that is one dish you need to try. I tried it because it was on Triple D, Guy would never send us down the wrong path. It is a bit pricey, but the food is worth it.   Homemade jam. I understand that everything is all fresh, they don't even have a freezer, shipped fresh and organic every morning. 4 stars instead of 5 is for the gluten free options. When we are in the area in the morning, we will be back for our breakfast fix.

This was a Yelp! find, searching for breakfast after going to farmers market, Decided to come here when i read the reviews that they had such high marks and that they have many gluten free options. Were sitting here not knowing anything about Alice Cooper owning the plaza, i said to our server...Who's the Alice Cooper fan? That's when i found out about him owning the whole plaza and thrift store (i'm a freak about thrift stores). I was interested in the gf banana pancakes and that is what i had, it was  delicious, all the flavor was there but they were more like a crepe because how thin they were, no complaint regarding that, just mentioning it. Great service, really good coffee with non-dairy flavored creamer (a bonus). Freshly squeezed orange juice.  Definitely will be back!

I met soon to be daughter-in-law here :)  We had 3 tacos lettuce cups MOLIDA LAMB  Creole aïoli, Bleu cheese, sweet potato hay PORK ADOVADA mango jicama relish, avocado, cilantro. PEKING DUCK plum sauce, fire roasted poblano apricot compote, Brie cheese i think my favorite was the pork adovada, but all of them had so much flavor it was like taking a trip to favah town! Chloe also had the Street Corn, she said she thought that was the best! Great service, beautiful atmosphere, most interesting taco combinations, thank you for opening my taste-buds to new and exciting  flavors  Will defiantly be back.

This is the second time here. First time i was here, i tried the grilled cheese sandwich. I thought it greasy but tasty. This last time i tried a grilled turkey club sandwich with gf flax seed bread, that too was greasy but good. I had a red velvet cupcake, that was delish. They make their own bread here, $8 a loaf, a bit steep, but you pay for freshness and quality. I think a good time to buy goodies is probably in the afternoon, you can buy them at a discounted price. I'd like to try their pretzels, they look so good, but you have to pre-order them. Will i go back? Im sure i will, i want to like it. It's Gluten Free and i want to support that.

Complete stumble upon, we were in the plaza  having breakfast a few months back and low and behold Alice Cooper owns the whole plaza, including the Original Breakfast House (that review will be separate from this). Small thrift store that has a really nice stage area set up just for Alice Cooper, surrounded by Alice and wife Sheryl, have a lot of items for sale. All money is donated to the Alice Coopers  The Rock teen rock music ministry, located next door to thrift store.  We recommend checking Alice Cooper's Attic and Thrift Store, we'll be back!

Not really sure if this address is the right location. They just built a bigger QT that is closer to the 101, right across the street from Shell and Culvers. Anyway, Nice and clean and they really look like they have a great system down. An employee greats you when you walk in, you are noticed, they are never to busy to help you.  Mov'em In And Mov'em Out, im sure that is their Moto! Bathrooms---I hate public bathrooms and normally refuse to use them, not at QT, They are always clean  Here is something i would like to mention if QT reads the reviews, offer more non dairy items and Gluten Free as well. This is an on going issue with alot of people these days, you could earn yourself that extra star, lol :) seriously.

Quite pleased with the renovation. Self served soda and icee machine. I wasn't aware of the new "assigned seating", we actually got the very last seats available for our movie, I didn't think that seating at the very front would work, but it did because of the New Recliner Chairs! Had a good time, I recommend checking it out.
