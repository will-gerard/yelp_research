I have been hearing rave reviews about this place from all my co-workers, so I decided to give it a go.  I called to place an order and the girl accidentally hung up on me. I don't know why that bothers me so much, maybe it's just because you should know how to operate your phone?  When I went to pick up my order the place is busy, as always which is a great thing. It's like going to a Mexican restaurant and seeing Mexicans, it just means the food is good.   I got the omelet with onions and ham, with hash browns and wheat toast. The top half of the hash browns were on point, crisp and tasty. The bottom half . . . soggy and soaked in grease. GROSS.   The omelet was huge! If you are looking for a lot of food this is the place to go, though if you are looking for taste I would skip the omelet. The only thing that didn't taste like cardboard was the ham. Thank God for the ham.   The wheat toast was ok, though the spread they include has chunks of fruit in it and is amazing.  Don't order the OJ to go. You get about 3oz. of it in a plastic sippy cup. I don't know if they thought I was heading to the airport?   Anyway, if you want a huge obese enticing portion go here you will get it. If you are looking for a non soggy breakfast I would keep looking.

Dear Owner that assisted us this morning,  There is a calculator next to your register, I suggest you use it.   You snapped at me because I said you charging me full price for the sandwich was dumb and we tried to tell you it would be cheaper to get the deal and the OJ.   Well sir, let's do the math.   $3.75 (full price) for the sandwich $1.80 for the OJ $0.51 tax ------------ $6.06 TOTAL  Now let's try it with the meal deal that would have gotten me a small pop with my sandwich and OJ.   $3.00 Meal Deal $1.80 OJ $0.44 tax ------------ $5.24 TOTAL  So tell me how that isn't cheaper? If you are doing it to me you are doing it to everyone who comes in your store. Knock the SHIT OFF and learn some simple math.

Local Breeze is one of our favorite spots here in downtown. The place is seriously low key and reminds me of grad school in Austin.   The food is great. But I would stick to something on some type of bread. The salads aren't bad . . . but I am definitely not a fan of the combinations of food in the salads.   I love that they open the door for your when you are coming and going, it just says Hi welcome to our place and thank you for coming. That makes me want to go back.   Really looking forward to Fall/Winter so we can go back to sitting on the patio.   Good job guys keep it up . . . and come out with some better salads.   Oh and the portions are HUGE. I usually have to take half home. . . and I'm not a small girl.

I started at this Gold's when it opened. It was shinny and new. Everything was in it's place. Though, others are right when they say the place fell by the way side quickly.   The amenities in the locker rooms were never stocked and when they were, they didn't work. Towels were always in the washer and weren't ready for you. They switched soaps to a cheap industrial smelling soap that made not want to take showers (they eventually switched it back, so you can only ding them for trying to be cheap). Also, all the people that signed up when the gym started pay a lot of money, though now there is a sign out front that says $19.95 No contracts. No gimmicks. Does that mean you had gimmicks before? and when do those gimmicks start again?   I had a lot of problems with the personal trainers, too much drama, the turn over is ridiculous.  There are pros to this club though, staff that have nothing to do with sales are really nice and tend to make things happen for you when your sales contact has moved onto another sale (which you can't blame them for, that's how they make a living). You get two hours of free parking underground, which is nice since there is no other free place to park DT.   If you are looking for a place to go workout for an hour and go home, this would be a great gym for you. If you are looking to workout before work or on your lunch breaks, then need to shower and freshen up, I would go somewhere else.

I am so disappointed.   We went to Rice Paper for lunch today and we waited for a table, then one of the waiters told us there was something open on the patio.   It's 90 degrees outside in Arizona right now. Wait there's shade. Ok, we'll eat on the patio. Oh what? All the tables are on the patio and you have 3 people. . . ok wait for us to move something together.   Are you all seated? Oh wait I forgot to tell you that our computers are down and we can't put in any food orders. No we can't write them on paper. Why? My manager said no. No. I don't know how long they will be down for. You can wait as long as you would like.   WHAT THE F*CK?! You could have told us this before we wasted 25 minutes of our lunch break in your stupid renovated not very good food house diner.   Rice Paper is officially off the menu.

Steve and Tom are fantastic. I love that they remember who you are and what you talked about the previous visit.   Tom is the one who does my adjustments and is amazing. In five minutes my body is put back into place and I'm ready to go again.   The place is clean, friendly and quick. If you're looking for a place to be adjusted, I'm pretty sure you'd be happy here.

First off this location is too busy, the line moves okay, but be ready to stand in it for 20 min or more.   Think ordering online will save you time? WRONG. It takes just as long to get your food there. Why you may ask? They only have one poor girl back there with no help filling orders by phone and in person.   What happens when this place doesn't staff their locations appropriately? They give you the wrong order, no joke missing items, wrong type of tortillas and cold, soggy food.   I love Chipotle, but you would be better off going to a different location.
