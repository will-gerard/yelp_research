The pizza, to die for! The sauce is perfectly spiced, the crust, especially when they throw a slice in the oven for you to re heat quickly, crisp and yummy.. This is my idea of pizza heaven. They place is a little shabby, and the people running the joint a little aloof and kinda like they are from another planet, but the pizza is really good. If you are ordering for carry out, call a bit more ahead than you want, I have never not had to wait while picking up the pizza..I am not a fan of the steak sandwich, skip that one. Go for the pizza!

Crap instruments, will not take back. We had our violin a week bought brand new and it does not hold tune, horrible sound. These people are not helpful, nor do they care. Very cheap products. Look elsewhere.

I could have massaged myself better with one hand. The decor is not inviting, really plain and clinical feeling, I prefer a plushy and comfy warm feeling atmosphere. The therapist did not use any pressure and did the same stroke up and down my entire body even though I requested Deep Tissue. Then they try and sell you a package which is bullshit. I would not waste my time at this place.

Cox added showtime to my bill last year, without my permission or request. I don't even have a receiver for it in my home. I just called yesterday to order hbo and showtime and this is when i was informed i'd been paying for showtime at $15 per month for 18 months! No apology no nothing, just a refund of $31! They said by me paying the bill, i am agreeing to the terms. I told them I didn't expect them to rip me off. Watch your bill closely people, you'll get burned.

This place is fraudulent and extremely rude and unprofessional. I was cursed as was my fiance by Travis, whom we went back to because they supposedly replaced our power steering pump for $350. Two weeks later it was whining again and we went back and they said it was the line to the pump and it needed replaced for another $200. When I went back for it, the noise was still there and travis said it was because there was a low amount of power steering fluid in there. Well, they just worked on it twice in the last 2 weeks, so how can that be? We had everything checked and it was not low. Travis told me this was not goodwill and they charge for services and he drove the car very fast and angrily with my fiance in the car telling him that if we came back again he was going to tell us to fuck off. My fiance had to ask him not to talk to him like that and to slow down. He said he needed to close shop, it was late and he was in a hurry.  Well, i am out over $500 and my car isn't fixed and I cannot go back because of their rude and intimidation tactics. They are thieves and liars and I wouldn't put it past them to look up my address and track me down and try and hurt me. I am not joking, do not go here. Unless you are someone who knows about cars and are a big guy that they won't mess with. I am contacting the BBB and 3 on your side and anyone else I can find to help me. A truly devastating experience.

I took the car back again and they said that they would change the pump out. They didn't change the pump out. Actually it is louder than ever and making a metal hitting metal sound now. I was basically told not to come back there would be no honoring of the warranty.

This place is wonderful. Went in with $500 and came out with 2 12 inch subs, an amp, a deck and speakers that they upgraded for free. They even gave me a free auxiliary cord. The service was great. Not like a big chain store to screw you. They worked with me and went down on prices to fit my budget. Definitely will return here. Came with a 1 year warranty and a one week tune up.

The food is awesome! Try the Philly Pita and Fries or the chicken and rice meal with salad and pita. It is really good. The place is clean and the people super friendly.  You can't go wrong here.

Does not accept credit or debit. Food is old and very chewy. Buffett sits in dark corner of room. Dont waste your money trust me. Very disappointing. The owner shoed us in and said help yourselves and walked back into the scary looking kitchen. The thai tea with cream was good though. The place looks like it has potential, but they definitely gave up!

I started seeing Katrina for Massage because i had alot of lower back pain as I am a Massage Therapist as well. Not only does she help relieve all of the pent up pain and stress from my job, she teaches me about my body/mind and spirit as well.  In her Massage though, she does a very unique Massage that is all her own combining many modalities that feel simply wonderful. She adds stretching and long flowing strokes and when she adds the hot stones, my muscles completely melt. Everything she does really takes you to a different place of being. She definitely adds many spiritual elements to the Massage that nurture on an energetic level releasing emotional blocks and holding patterns in the body. She teaches you how to let go. I recommend her highly and once you've tried her, you won't want another therapist.
