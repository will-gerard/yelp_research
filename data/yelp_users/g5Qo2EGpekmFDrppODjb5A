This location is NOT closed. I was there earlier today. Clean, friendly, and almost completely empty - I saw only two other patients, and its right in the middle of flu season. Call ahead to make an appointment - I did and I think that's why I got in so quickly.

Appears to be closed as of Saturday 2/21. Tried to make reservations though their website but got no reply. Tried to call but was unable to reach them because of "phone company" problems. Doors were locked, no tables visible inside.

Update: in response to my review, I received a message saying the restaurant has closed.
