Now I've lived in Arizona my whole life and I've been going to this "festival" for quite some time and it seems to me that every year it gets a little more expensive,the food is nothing special, the vendors get more sparse and more and more people feel the need to bring their kids and strollers to this "drinking festival."   How can you call it a Culinary Festival when you have pizza you can get anywhere, mexican food I can get down the street and drinks I can make at home?   And for all you people out there who decide that you need to sit on someone's beer and spill it all over their phone and I don't care how wasted you are, don't offer them the butt end of your damn drink. I mean seriously is this really what the world is coming to? Not only did that biotch spill my entire drink but she fucked up my phone and I would have gone on my merry little way not giving two thoughts to what just happened but she had to offer me backwash.   I would like to send thanks out to the man that decided to give me and my two girls I was with $65 in free tickets. He was fed up and had to bail and was kind enough to share some love. So thank you free ticket man, you made the end of the "festival" a lot more fun!

Well... even after not visiting the Vig for almost a year everytime I go there it is a great crowd... I don't think I have ever had a bad time or met anyone completely rude. Sunday is the best day to go.. Sunday Funday! 1/2 price wine + good company + live music - who could ask for more?   I'm normally a mixed drink drinker... but whenever I go to the Vig I always go back to wine, so I can't comment on the mixed drinks, food is decent but what doesn't taste good when your starving and drinking?   Also heard they are opening another one on 16th street... double the fun!

Simply amazing! Menu is small but sooo good! I find myself going there on a more regular basis just to keep trying different things on the menu.

I've been going toSuper Paulene's for over a year now and honestly it is one of the best places in the valley to get a mani/pedi. It is so relaxing and Shaun is always super nice. All the ladies are very good.  Minus one star for the sometimes wait I have even though I have made an appointment.  Also, bring cash or tips.

I know it's been almost two weeks since Nascar was at PIR but I needed some time to let this experience marinade with me. My friend had called and asked if I wanted to go to this"joyus" event and I thought about it for a minute and asked myself how bad could it really be?   Well besides the bomb ass tickets we got from my friends boss I was completely taken back by the whole freakin' secret society that attend this event... It was insane to say the least. I would have to recommend buying the headphones with the little tv ($30) so you can tune into any driver and hear what is really going on in the race because you can't hear crap coming out of the speakers.   Now, I would have to compare Nascar to hockey, the only good thing about a hockey game is a good fight. Same with Nascar, race is pretty boring without the crashes. Now I'm not going out to this event in the hopes that someone is going to get seriously injured so it was nice to see some cars get smashed up without injury.   Now my biggest complaint, if you plan on going to an event with AT LEAST 100,000 people, please don't get bent out of shape if someone's jacket rubs your arm. So to the lady that lost it at the hot dog stand because my jacket touch your arm, you should have accepted the water I was offering you and NOT CONTINUED DRINKING. Also, if you plan on rolling your eyes at someone and talking shit don't start crying when they confront you and run to your husband like he is going to help you out of the situation your drunk ass got yourself in.   All in all it was a good experience but probably not something I would ever go to again.

First off I would like to thank Donald S. for creating such a great alliteration for OTS (Old Town Scottsdale).   Now onto American Junkie, first I would have to say that the name does represent some of the people that go in here. I was there last Sunday, for some reason I decided to go out and have a few drinks which landed me here and all I could think is how in the hell is this place so busy for a Sunday night? And then I came to my senses and realized that I was in Scottsdale, I forgot 85% of the people there live off of mommy and daddy.   I arrived there with two of my friends and it only took us a measly 15 minutes to get drinks. The bartenders manage to serve drinks and never look up at the bar, pretty amazing talent if I say so! Secondly all the drunk ass chicks dancing on the bar was definitely a no-go. I mean come on if you truly are going to have a dance off on the bar why don't you try pick out some girls that can actually stand, it might work a little better as well as help you avoid a lawsuit.   The only thing I could appreciate was they had a table setup outside on the patio for people to play beer-pong. Now let me clarify, I appreciated that they took time to think that people would like to play, did not appreciate the drunk assholes playing beer pong and throwing beer all over the patio.   I might give this place another chance but then again why should I? There are so many other places in OTS that are a lot funner!

Bottom Line: Everyone I've taken here keeps coming back for more.  This place hands down is better than Five Guys and In & Out combined.   I stumbled upon Smashburger after coming out of the movies and I've been there almost every weekend for a meal since. They have an amazing menu from their signature burgers to building your own, salads, hot dogs, sides (amazing sweet potatoe fries) and shakes, even BEER!   I promise no one will b disappointed.

I definitely had a great time here. Originally were going to head to get sushi at Tempte Marketplace and was happy to find that they finally put another fun bar in Tempe Marketplace because Cadillac Ranch and San Felipes gets a little old.   I went with one of my friends and we shared the soft prezetel for an appetizer and shared the Margherita pizza and Chipotle Mac & Cheese and had a few beers. I will definitely be back to try some more things on their menu.   You can definitely tell that some of the servers were new and weren't that expirenced but hopefully time will help that. Mike the restuarant Manager stopped by our table to see how our food was and how our expirence was which is always a nice thing for managers to do to get some feedback.

We had  party of 6 people Friday July 4th and it wasn't crowded by any means. We got sat and our drinks cam out reasonably fast. We had 3 Salmon plates that were ordered, 1 salad, 1 pulled pork and I had 2 appetizers. All the salmons came under cooked and one FROZEN!! They took those back and said they'd re-do them. Then the pulled pork sanwhich came out with no bun and no side (never ended up getting the side for the rest of the meal, the bun came out about 20 mins later). The salad was okay and so were my apps but what a cluster F of a meal. For a pretty high pice $24 for a salmon dish I expect it to come out with perfection, to have ALL 3 messed up you definitely wonder who is running the back of house. I'd never go bck. 2nd visit there for another person in our party and the same things happened to them on their first visit. Definitely would not recommend to  waste your money  or your time.
