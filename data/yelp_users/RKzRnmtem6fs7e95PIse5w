Disappointment, regret, irritation.  After spending thousands of dollars removing a tumor from beloved feline, where I received mediocre service at best, I now will be asking for my cat's records and find a new veterinarian.  I call Arrow Animal Hospital at 8 a.m. to inform them my cat's tumor was bleeding all over my house.  I called them back at 11 a.m. and was put on hold.  I finally received a call at 2:30 p.m., more than five hours later. I intend to go somewhere that cares as much about my pet as I do.
