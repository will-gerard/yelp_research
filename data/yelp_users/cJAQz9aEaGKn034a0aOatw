Rooms are old and aged. I had to stay here for a business event. I will never come back on my own. They tried to remodel this old hotel, but they only updated a few things, like the sinks and furniture - the rest is still OLD.  It's like the owner is too cheap to upgrade the hotel the right way, so he just replaced a few things.  If you come to Phoenix, I recommend staying elsewhere - until this place goes through a remodel.    Aside from that, the walls are very thin. I could hear people talking in other rooms, and at 5:00am, someone slammed their door and it probably woke up all guests on the ENTIRE floor! (9th floor) - two hours before my alarm clock!  I will NOT be staying here again.  In the conference rooms (Ellis rooms), the tables were very thin and lightweight, and one person lightly bumped the table as he scooted his chair and everyone's drink splashed over - down the whole row. Very cheap tables.

Excellent and prompt service.  Cool place.  It's a bar, glow in the dark bowling, and the waitresses are cool too.
