I came here for a much needed staycation I bought on groupon. Only to find out when I checked in I bought it for the wrong dates and I was almost in tears since I was looking forward to this night. the hotel staff was quick very helpful and able to get us a room last minute close to the adult pool :):) the service was really good at the adult pool and later we wandered to the wine bar where the service was just as fabulous. Don't forget to ask for a az resident discount when you check in. Thank you for making our staycation great!

Was I'n there a few weeks ago bought a groupon.. We ment a couple of friends there for happy hour.. The bartender ignored us, we had to ask for a menu.. And the bartender had six people and sat behind the bar doing paperwork . We had to ask for another round of drinks and the bartender seemed annoyed with Us. So we asked for our check and never got to use our groupon this place will be lucky to stay I'n business for 6 months!!

Went here for a friend's birthday last night. The patio and the view are really pretty . Food was just ok,  service was really good. It turned into singles night around 8 and thought it was kinda weird we weren't allowed to go inside on the dance floor since we weren't part of the singles group. Other then that check this place out around sunset so you can enjoy the view!

The floors filthy.. and the nail techs mostly men. And there was a dog non-stip barking in the room while I was getting a pedicure..not relaxing at all. I won't be back !!
