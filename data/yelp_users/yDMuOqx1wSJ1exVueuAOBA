This a great restaurant in the Gilbert area.  Blue 32 has excellent food, great service and a awesome menu.  The layout is open and friendly with great views of any sporting event on the numerous televisions throughout.  - Bradley Potter www.Yoursevillehome.com

This location for wings and other food has gone down.  It seems like they have gone to lower quality food.  Last time I was there the boneless wings tasted like dirty dish water, I had to send them back.  I completely lost my appetite after that. www.Myphoenixareahomes.com
