Giligans is a bar that my friend's and I LOVE to go to when out in old town. The prices are a little steep for a "dive" bar, however the atmosphere is always fun. My friends and I love to play the over-sized JENGA and Connect four.   This past Saturday, however, was horrible. We arrived and ordered drinks as usual. We started to play the connect four, and my friend cut his hand very badly on the connect 4 board. I asked a woman who was walking by for a band-aid, she appeared to be a manager. She said yes and kept walking. About ten minutes later his hand was still bleeding and she still had not brought it over. We walked to the bar and I asked a security guard if he could get us one. When he came out the woman followed and completely ignored us. I tapped her shoulder and asked if she had forgot about us. She immediately turned around and said   "I am too busy to be bothered with your little problems. Put your hands on me again and see what happens to you."  I immediately reported this to the owner who was standing nearby and she apologized for what happened, but did not seem to really be shocked at all.  This is unacceptable behavior from anyone in any business. It was completely brushed under the rug by everyone who we spoke with and went unrecognized.

Can you give less than one star? I called on a friday night for delivery and the guy told me right away they were done delivering even though the website said they still had an hour left. He asked me to hold, but i could hear everything he was saying in the background. He was joking with his friends. Very unprofessional. When i went to pick up my food, the bar was covered in trash and dirty plates. The bar tender was taking shots and swearing up and down about how much he hated his job. I just about walked out when he started to ask me why i wasnt smiling over and over. His friends were hitting on me while i waited for my food. This place was disgusting and should be shut down for so many reasons. I will never return to this p

I have been going here for 8 years now! I have never witnessed such friendly and caring staff. Your comfort is of utmost importance to their staff. Because of them i am no longer afraid to go to the dentist!
