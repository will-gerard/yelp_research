This is one of the true Arizona restaurants, and I recommend this place to anyone from out of town. Well, anyone in town too. The staff is extremely fun and nice, which is hard to come by these days.  The food is awesome. gigantic portions, but all the better to take home and enjoy the next day (or two...). The pizza and salads are my favorite, and of course one cannot forget the glutenous wonder of the pizza cookie (formerly the pzookie). This brings ooey gooey goodness to a whole new level.   The only downside... Its size, but that is part of their schtick. Get there early, whether it is lunch or dinner or expect to wait a long time. Trust me though, it is well worth it. Oh and parking sucks too. Again the food and service are worth it the inconvenience.  **All the locations are great, the mesa one (one of the newest locations) is probably the worst, but I say that with a grain of salt. It is still better than most of the restaurants out there.

Not good for vegetarians. They put meat in EVERYTHING. There is nothing like getting a "vegetarian" meal to find meat chucks floating in the sauce. In addition, every time I eat there I get sick. Seriously, the chain Mexican food restaurants need to be banned from Arizona. There are so many great authentic Sonoran Mexican food places around town, the chains just ruin it. Unfortunately none of them are by my house, so I am forced to try these crappy chains... When will I ever learn?

Nasty. Terrible service, hotel food. Save your money or go to via de los Santos up the road!

Best sushi in town. Huge rolls, and unique ones too. Try the escolar sashimi. It is usually a special on the board behind the sushi bar. It is lighly seared (for those of you who can't handle the slab of raw fish style of sashmi). The squid salad is really good too, when they have it :(

Hair in the salsa. What felt like a piece of sand in the deep fried cheese crisp. Refusal to let me order off the kids menu despite my recent surgery and documentation to support it -- you know because if an adult orders a kids sized portion (ie a normal portion) it will magically cost the restaurant more money. What the...?  Seriously not worth it and I won't go back.

Best mushroom enchilada's in town! I am always so baffled by the crappy chain restaurants getting good reviews, and the small local restaurants getting bad reviews.  This is one of those places the service kinda sucks, emphasize kinda, but the food it so good it doesn't matter. The salsa is yummy, and they have great chips.  Stop your chain addiction  and try out one of these great local favorites!  Oh for those of you who are looking for a healthy Mexican option, stick with Rubio's. This is good ol' authentic, greasy yummy Mexican food.

Trendy, over priced, typical snotty scottsdale attitudes. The only thing they have that I adore is their iced green tea. It is super yummy, but not worth enduring the price and attitude for.

It seems like a cool idea, and as you park and see this unassuming building and begin the trek down the stairs it seems like it might be a cool night after all. Unfortunately, after that it is just ok. The service was ok, the food, some good, some not so great. I guess it is hard to expect great seafood this far from the ocean, but I have had better here in the valley.  On top of that it is underground, so if you are unfortunate enough to go on a day Sally and Bob decide to bring their rug rats, (think acoustics and screaming children) the whole thing just sucks. It is also quite expensive for my taste. $100 for 2 people and no cocktails.

Great place for the vegetarians and meat lovers alike. Mind you, I am not a connoisseur of  authentic Mediterranean food, but I really do enjoy this place. They honestly have the best Hummus I have ever tasted. My favorite main dish is the lentil fetoush salad. It is enough for 2-3 meals.

Nasty, tasteless nuggets of over-fried batter. Even Long John Silvers is better than this dump. Of course if you're a drunk college student you may enjoy this after a night at the bar.

I'm sorry, but those of you who have given Serrano's  a good review never had really great authentic Mexican food. I've tried this place a couple times, only because it is close to my house. Each time I am hopeful it will get better. Each time it disappoints more than the previous.  Save your money.

This is a nice asian take-out style restaurant (you can order and sit down too). The portions are pretty big, and they have a good selection. WAAAAAAY better than Pei Wei which is in the same shopping center.   The only downside is their breading is a little heavy, but other than that I have enjoyed everything I have tried there.

Quite possibly the best authentic Sonoran Mexican food in Arizona, no wait anywhere!!  This place seems like a total dump, but trust me the food is awesome!   Try their cheese crisps, chili relleno (anyone who likes this dish knows it pretty much sucks most places), Shrimp fajita burrito pollo fundito style... Some of their chicken dishes are not great, as I am not a huge fan of shredded chicken. Opt for the fajita meat instead.  Try hitting this place during dinner time on the weekend, and you will understand why all the locals to sunny slope don't tell anyone about this place. Unfortunately the wait during peak hours sucks, but worth the wait! Parking can suck so just park in the neighborhood behind the restaurant. Also, *some* of the servers are not great, but again, the food is worth it.

This is more of an Asian fusion restaurant, and very good. The food is a little greasy, and a little bit pricey but worth an occasional visit. Some of my favorites are the lemon grass chicken, spicy crackling calamari salad, and the sizzling spicy  tofu. I personally think this place is better that PF Changs.  Mind you, it is still a chain, just a much smaller one. Try it out, I don't think you will be disappointed.

This is such a cool little place, just about hidden in a little building in a crappy part of downtown Phoenix. It is one of those tiny little diners, with GREAT food. I am so happy one of my co-workers convinced me to try it out. Expect a wait if you go during peak hours. The simplicity of the menu, and the great food it worth the wait though.  Not sure why some of you had such a bad experience... Maybe it's because you went in the summer, I would venture to say that any place that small and that busy would suck in the heat.

I have been going to Dr. Parva & Dr. Ford (the owners) for years, following them around town. When I heard they were opening their own place I was like "YAY" when they said it was at Higley and Pecos I was like "BOOOOO". However, I still make the 30 minute drive from Tempe to get the best veterinary care I have found in my 30 + years on this planet (and in AZ).  To give you an example, when I had to put my dog down a couple of months ago, the whole place was crying. THE WHOLE PLACE. They always take their time with you and your pet, explaining everything thoroughly so you understand whats going on and what you may be up against. Another example is a looong time ago my cat was sick with kidney disease, it was a Sunday and he was hurting. I got a hold of Dr. Parva and she met me up at the Vet on her way back from Tucson to put him down. She knew how upset I was and didn't make me pay or make decisions at that time (they did bill me so don't expect a freebie), but it was comforting to know she was there when I needed her and she cared and trusted me enough to know I just needed to grieve.  I can't say enough about this place, the tech and front desk are loving and amazing, the doctors are FABULOUS and I just love them all so much.

Of course, like everyone else our a/c decides to die on one of the 1st hot HOT days of the year! So I called a bunch of places, and American Dream was the only one who answered and actually made an appointment with me for first thing the next morning (I called on Saturday evening). Terry was my technician, he was very thorough and he found the problem right away. He didn't do anything until he quoted us the price, and we felt it was very reasonable. We highly recommend this company, especially if you are in an emergency situation.

Yum! Options for everyone, including soy and sorbet. Awesome local ice cream/gelato shop. Don't miss out on this gem.  So glad it moved south to Southern and McClintock!

If you are into that see and be seen, well scene then this is a place you might like. The food was over priced, and ok... I guess. The service was horrible. Snotty, I'm too hot to be a waiter , what the hll do you want, attitudes totally ruined the experience for me.   For better, cheaper Italian food drive a couple miles south to Sauce. Same company, waaaaaaay better business model well, for us simple folk anyway.

I had not used my sprinklers in the backyard in a few weeks because I was letting the summer grass die off before the winter over seeding.  I went to turn on the sprinklers to water the freshly seeded lawn when the sprinklers began to slowly drip.  I called Jim's Irrigation the following morning and Jim, the owner, answered the phone.  Jim was able to get out to my house the same day and was ON TIME!  He advised me that it was a worn out valve and advised that since he was out that I should go ahead and replace all of the valves to save any future expenses on a service call for the other valves that appeared to all be the same age and they very likely could have malfunctioned in the very near future.  Jim provided recommendations on when these parts should be serviced and even answered my questions on the frequency of watering my yard.  I would call Jim in the future for any needed repair or installation and would refer his company to friends and family.

This place is BEAUTIFUL. It just exudes femininity. The classes are really cool and sexy (well some of them are sexy :). I've taken the burlesque, hula hoop, stretch, salsa pump, Zumba and GI Jane classes. They were all really fun and all women which is so awesome.   Christie has created a really wonderful place for women to exercise, make friends and feel good about themselves. Do yourself a favor and try out a couple of their classes!

Amazing hairstylists, beautiful salon.   I have been coming here for 17+ years. I go to the owner for color, and Isabella for my cut. LOVE them. Not sure what the heck P.A. is talking about, I think he/she just had a bad experience, but rest assured you won't be disappointed if you go to the above 2 people. Not to mention they are reasonably priced. Want overpriced bad service go to Dolce or one of the mall salons.

We will NEVER move ourselves again. Everyone has heard horror stories about crappy movers, things getting stolen or jacked up. Not with these guys.  PROS:  On-time Super fast Efficient Professional Helpful Cost effective  CONS:  Only that I didn't hire them in the past.  We couldn't believe how cheap it ended up being. We had a 2300 SQ FT home and we were quoted by other companies about 4 times what it ended up costing.  They gave us tips on how to make it more cost effective, we were seriously blown away. Oh and they charge in 15 minute increments and disclosed all costs (nothing hidden) upfront. They make me want to move again (well not really that part sucked, but they truly made the actual move part cake) !

Groupon was misleading and a bad deal, always try to upsell and "repair" the windshield. Attitude upon arriving and avoided my questions about the scam. Disappointed. Going to cobblestone from now on, they have it figured out.

I just heard about this place from my hairdresser today, and made a beeline for it. Let me just say it was wonderful. The people were extremely friendly and helpful, the food was OUTSTANDING, the ambiance was warm and inviting. They also had a huge selection of teas and coffee's. Their signature pomegranate tea is homemade by the owner with agave. Super yummy! I HIGHLY recommend this little gem to the veggie and non-veggies out there! Yum, Yum!

Let me start by saying that I am somewhat of a fake tan-aholic. Although, since gaining some "emotional" weight, I have been in hibernation over the last year. I have tried Jergens to fancy smancy french self tanner and of course orange-tastic Mystic. All with varying mediocre results (and lovely patchy fading). So when gearing up for our San Diego trip I decided to try something new. I googled spray tan and Platinum Spray Tan came up. What amazed me the most is the great pricing and the fact that it is not a booth style tan, but an airbrush tan. The owner, MJ, is great, and I was able to get in quickly. The tan looks amazing and she was so thorough with her pre & post care (to make the tan last longer). She had her own products to sell, but she started off telling me what I could use (with the same results) from the drug store. I highly recommend trying her out, I think you will be hooked like I am.

What a beautiful place, that I had no idea existed. Thanks to restaurant week and Quiessence being booked we decided on this lovely place for our 4th anniversary.   The atmosphere is quite wonderful. I couldn't believe the old rustic barn (that they hold events in) was so charming. They have little white lights everywhere outside, making it quite enchanting. They have indoor and outdoor seating (no misters for the hot months).  The service was very good. Not too "in your face" and there was no searching for our waitress for drink refills, etc. A+  The food was really good. We are not usually big on the fancy-smancy food of more upscale restaurants, but we were both pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor of the food. I had the Serrano tortilla soup - VERY good, but a bit spicy so beware. I loved it. My husband ate the trout and beet salad and he thought it was good - but a little out of his normal comfort zone for flavors. We both enjoyed the Brazino (Sea Bass) in saffron broth. That was good - not outstanding but still quite tasty. It was followed up with some sort of corn cakes, goat milk ice cream and chili infused whip cream. That was probably the best part of the meal. I was weary of the goat milk ice cream, but it was DELICIOUS and from a local farm in Glendale.  Definitely try this place out for a special evening, when you can comfortably sit outside and enjoy the superb ambiance. No kiddos please (I say this as a parent, as I think it will be way more fun for them to explore the grounds than sit quietly and eat not so kid friendly food)

Carrie is awesome. I mean look at my lips, I am fabulous!   I started coming to her in 2007 and do not trust anyone else but her. She is very sweet, knowledgable and helpful. I never thought I would let anyone touch my face, but with Carrie I feel safe in knowing she truly is an expert. She always tries to find you the best deal via rebates and coupons too. I highly recommend her to anyone considering botox or fillers.
