After calling them 4 times and getting hung up on, I finally got to order a cab...an hour passed, they said another half hour, then another hour passed...i cancel the cab which never showed up.  When I finally found another solution and we were on the road, one of their cabbies cut us off and slammed the breaks.  We luckily avoided an accident, but the same cab (#488) took off and must have been doing 60 on a 35.  Garbage service from a company that hires unsafe drivers.  Never again.

I had my food delivered, so I can't speak to the physical restaurant myself, but some of the reviews on here don't do the food justice.    I started with the Caprese Salad ($7.00).  Everything was beautiful.  The tomatoes were fresh, the mozzarella was freshly made and the basil was still bright green.  In the Spaghetti and meatballs ($13.00), the pasta was al dente (even though it was delivered), the sauce was flavorful and the meatballs were cooked properly.  Lastly, the Italian Bread Pudding with Vanilla Bean Gelato was amazing.  GrubHub says it's one of the restaurant's most popular dishes, and it is well deserved.  Long story short, let the Olive Garden crowd enjoy their frozen food cooked in microwaves.

I never take anything back.  My drink tasted like sanitizer...to be fair, I got two drinks for $18 which isn't bad in Scottsdale, and only 2 tasted like chemicals but still.  The owner is awesome, but his bar staff rolled his eyes at me and skipped me twice in the rotation when I told him he was serving us chemical solution.  EFF that guy.

This was so much fun.  The owner showed me how to strap in the canoe to my SUV (I'm a nerd, so I would have just paid for the lesson), and we were on the river at no time.  So affordable, we could do it every weekend.  We've been back twice now, and look forward to doing it every time we're introducing someone new to the river.

The food is delicious, the kitchen runs like a top, timing was perfect and the ambiance was wonderful.  Only thing that keeps this being 5 stars is that the damned waiter kept winking and flirting with my date.  I may go back, but only with my guy friends from here on out, lol.

I love Cartel.  I really do think they're amongst the best roasters in the country.  While living in Tucson, I went there 4-5 times a week, and if you have a Cartel by you, you should give them a shot.    Yes, they serve food and tea.  Drink the coffee.  They're expert coffee roasters, baristas (& dare I say...coffee snobs) and it shows in the end product.

I'm sitting here drinking a Vernor's in a glass bottle while eating a Hani at a Coney Island  ...and I ask you: is that last sentence the most Detroit thing you've ever heard, or what?  The food is delicious, the Hani was at my table faster than it ever was in Michigan.  I can't say how nice it is to have this place in town.  The only downfall I see to it are the hours.  Like a lot of places in this part of downtown Phoenix, it closes once the employees at the local office buildings are done with lunch.  It's such a shame, because I think that it could do so well at night if there were a bar it could partner up with in the area.
