So where does one go to buy food items Christmas night?  Ranch Market... which was open until 8:00PM!  The only place we found open after an hour of telephone calls and internet searchs.. This place has a huge selection!  And it was crazy  busy!  This place is awesome.. although it caters to the Latin comunnity, I was able to find the everyday items to prepare a "white boy" meal!    Language may be a problem for some, but I found the staff to be very friendly and helpfull!

MEATLOAF!!!!   OK.. so my mom's meatloaf growing up was NOT the best...(sorry mom, it just wasn't your thing) in fact, I had no desire for meatloaf again until I tried the meatloaf at AJ's. I'm not even sure why I tried it... I mean, to me meatloaf and stomach pumping were always used in the same sentence, so I should have ran when I saw the meatloaf in the AJ's display case.   Perhaps it was the hunger pangs (pains), perhaps it was the artistic way the bright red glaze embraced the loaf... It really makes no difference, I was hypnotized and had to have it!  This is the best that I ever had..  Their meatloaf is always juicy, beefy and perfectly spiced (for me) add the savory, somewhat spicy chile sauce based glaze....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... For me a yummy meal for about $5.00.   Based on the above mentioned childhood trauma, I may lack the knowledge of of really really great meatloaf... and AJ's is just "OK"... so if you have a favorite meatloaf place, PLEASE email it over... now that the meatloaf scars are starting to heal.. it may be time to experiment and try more!

I'm thinking that the normal staff was off yesterday.   I went to Cherry Blossom with very high hopes thanks all the positive yelp reports and was very disappointed. This onetime experience won't stop me from coming back to give the Cafe another chance...as I think I might have been transported to a parallel universe for this meal.   First off... cute little place, there is no doubt that this is not a chain. The interior of the restaurant is simple and looks more like your dining at an authentic Asian bistro in Vancouver rather then in a central Phoenix strip mall. Our server was a little slow getting to us, again, this is not a chain, so that was overlooked.   I ordered a Summer Roll (per menu - Shrimp, lettuce, avocado, cucumber and rice noodles) and a Shrimp tempera roll. When the orders arrived the summer roll looked great, but was stuffed with a "bonus" of that weird crab lookalike stuff made from fish heads and fins.. YUK! Not a problem, I'll just scoop it out onto the appetizer plate...   so when I counted, the Summer roll with shrimp, did have shrimp.. 2 of them, and I kid you not, 1/2 cup of that crab stuff.   When my "shrimp" tempura roll arrived, guess what?? its a fake crab tempura roll with one shrimp... lol... The rice...VERY sticky... By the time the meal was over, my app plate was mounded with about a cup of this crab scented stuff... such a waste...   My friend's pasta ( Marsala Chicken) was great... the chicken was all breast meat, with a really good Marsala sauce...it was impressive! ... So overall... weird experience... will it keep me away??... no, well not unless it happens again...  The strangest thing about this whole ordeal is the fact  the main ingredient of my appetizer and sushi roll was not even on the menu.

Ahhh... Apollos....   The little gay bay down the street... Apollos has evolved over the years... I've had some good times here... and now that their makeover is almost complete ( bathrooms to be renovated soon I understand...SOON I hope! ).. I might be going back more often.   The surly bartenders have long been replaced and a huge patio constructed... although I no longer smoke, its an enjoyable area.   Although its not my first choice of bars, I stop by from time to time to enjoy a "well made" (read: strong) cocktail, and catch up with buds. The best nights (my opinion) are Karaoke nites, when the place normally packs with a very diverse crowd.   Aside from my issues with the men's bathroom... (only the padlocks were worse) and the overly bright lighting, this bar is getting better! After chatting with the owner ...Its great to know that they are "in touch" with their patrons and will quickly address any issues!   I'm really looking forward to the completion of the renovations!

Fantastic Eastern European Bakery and Products!  Came shopping here for pastries and discovered they have a whole lot more.  Not only do they have freshly baked cookies, cakes and pastries, they also had hand made Pierogis, sausages and kielbasa!  Hard to find Cech candies and products were everywhere, for a moment, it felt like shopping in Brno or Lodz.  The women  who work there are very kind and helpful.  Enjoy!

Lets see....... they stock La Valle San Marzano Tomatoes and Tomatoe paste ( The only products I use for sauce) , Il Primo Hot giardiniera ( makes any sandwich yummy) and Panettone at Christmas. Fresh rolls and pastries!!!   Their pizzas are great and if you want a GREAT sandwich, try Niccoli's homemade Italian sub...mmm mmm... best sub in the city...no question its homemade!  Niccoli's is like a little Italy right on 16th street! Check 'em out!

Here is my question.... Why are the Arichokes so hard to come by at Houstons?  Its a game now... I called today... ( Both PHX and SD ) to see if either location had my favorite app in this entire world... NOTHING... at either... in fact I have attempted to enjoy these in the last month... always either "sold out" or did not get them in.  WHY I ASK? WHYYYYYYYYY?   They are so yummy... I will continure my hunt and continue to call and call and call...I will have my Chokes!

I've been a patient of Dr. Purtell since I moved to Phoenix back in 1993... growing up with 2 uncles that are dentists, I was schooled early on how to "pick out" a great dentist.. and Dr. Purtell has been my one and only choice in the valley!    His demeanor is relaxed and calming, yet he is extremely professional and precise.  I dread the day he ever retires = (.   His staff is always upbeat and attentive, and my cleanings are so good..people always comment how great my teeth look!!     I have to give this office EXTREME HIGH marks for accommodating my anxiety for the few times I needed a cavity filled... they are a very caring group who are work together like a family... I would recommend Dr. Purtell and his staff in a heartbeat and without reservations.

FLO... Please open a central Phoenix location!   I have to agree with Gabi.. I love this location.. the service is always good, the food always yummy.. This location is focused on Thai flavors more so then Chinese.   Today I came in for their lunch special.. not bad for $13.00 !   Started with the Pot Stickers... 6 little pan fried dumplings, savory and piping hot! These are one of the best in the valley I think! ($5.00)   For the main entree, I ordered the Lemon Grass chicken ($7.50) which is a smaller portion then dinner, served with rice and a fresh mixed green salad, peanut dressing. This dish is my favorite here... tender chicken slices, teamed with lots of mixed veggies, all kissed with lemon grass infused light brown sauce..YUM! You really can't go wrong here..   From what I understand from the attentive bartender is that Flos offers a happy hour Mon-Friday with half priced drinks and appetizers... and on Saturdays, they offer a $5.00 lunch special! Awesome! Check it out... if you like Thai... you'll love this Flos Location!

Happy Hour Review   Although this is not my favorite restaurant, its convenient location and attractive happy hour prices brought me and my YAP  in. Until 7:00pm half off selected apps including selected rolls...3 crab-stix and 1 spicy tuna. Average (rail / draft ) price $3.00. You have to sit in the upstairs bar area for the discount, which automatically puts you behind the 8-ball for good service.   The food was 'OK', I was unable to determine if the crab filling in the rolls was "true crab" , the pot sticker filling was much like flavored sawdust, however...the sweet and spicy shrimp were pretty good... so 2 out of 3 apps were decent.   See posted picture of suspect pot-stickers... proceed with caution!   if we make it back again, will opt for the pizza apps... they can't screw that up... right??   The Good: Location, views, prices  The Bad: Food..not the best  Just Plain Ugly: Pot sticker filling

With all the deeply discounted clothing sales going on... I over purchased some Guess jeans and since some of them needed hemmed... I solicited a recommendation from Gabi.   Gabi suggested "Fifth Avenue"   Much like a fine masterpiece, their prices are not cheap, nor were the jeans ready in a hurry.   As a man who prefers quality over quantity, this did not scare me.   The owners were very precise, and ensured that requests and expectations were communicated. I was assured that quality was top priority, which put my mind at ease.   My Jeans were done in about 2 weeks,  which for some people, would be unacceptable, for me however, my motto is ... "Please...take whatever time you need to do the job correctly"   When I picked up my Jeans, I was REALLY impressed, not only were they finished PERFECTLY, but the attention to the detail was outstanding. Example: one pair of jeans has a unique thread color combination on the pockets and seams... This guy matched the color so well it was amazing to me.. I'm sure any other place would have overlooked the subtle color variance and just used a standard color.   NOTE: I was warned in advance by both Gabi and the establishment .. that debit cards nor credit cards were NOT accepted for payment...so CASH IN HAND is the only option.... This was the only draw back to the establishment.  FYI... The final cost was about $20.00 a pair.    Thanks again Gabi!!!

Unsurpassed !!!!    Our Dinner in the new "Praying Monk" dining area of Elements was fantastic... the view... spectacular!!   The new dining area is awesome... more intimate and less "active" then then the main dining room, with warm wood tones and floor to ceiling sliding glass doors that permit uninterrupted views of Paradise Valley!  We noticed 2 outdoor seating areas, which, in cooler weather...would be PRIME SEATING!!!  We started  with *ahi tuna tartar and the elemental soup ... both were amazing...  the Tuna, perfectly balanced on a bed of seasoned cucumber "pasta" coupled with 3 sesame pancakes... the squash soup was velvety with a "tempura"  squash blossom floating as a center piece... a perfect beginning...  Our salads were perfect; the Caesar was lightly dressed and far from the gloppy mess that many establishments offer... the  tomato & watermelon mosaic salad was AMAZING... perfectly ripened heirloom tomatoes, fresh "shaved" watermelon and a flavorful  charred pepper sorbet .. the light herbed dressing that was "whispered" on the plate enhanced the entire dish ...   My guest enjoyed the nights special,  grilled Lamb... which, I didn't get a chance to review.  It apparently was so good... he didn't want to share.  I enjoyed a perfectly cooked pan roasted free range chicken "kung pao" style.  I was pleased that  the Kung Pao seasoning was engaged with the pearl pasta so I was able enjoy the chick two ways... natural & succulent...however I could also enlist the pasta to add the Kung Pao flavor.  The additional sides ordered were the  truffled mac n' cheese.. much lighter then expected, and the tender, tender, tender  grilled asparagus... YUM!!!  Deserts enjoyed were the german chocolate cake & coconut gelato along with the strawberry rhubarb funnel cake & buttermilk ice cream.  Both were decedent... but the coconut gelato was soooooooo good, we had to order another scoop.  I used to enjoy eating at the tables "nudged" up against the large windows facing the pool in the main dining room... but now that I've experienced the Praying Monk room... there will be no going back... the new dining area really is special!!!

I'm not sure why I never reviewed Well & Being at Willow Stream ... Oh .. right... I want to keep it a secret.    Ok... so .. Spas are great... and most are focused on relaxation...regrettably, it appears that spas have now become the "springboard" pre-marriage or pre-baby "fun spot"... BLEK!!!!!    Thank god this place is upscale, extremely professional and does not seem to encourage a "party" environment.    Although I loved Joya back when... however, it soon became abused by the "1st time spa" groups.. This type of behavior is not conducive to a relaxing experience.   None-the-less I try and avoid weekends at any spa primarily for that reason.  Well & Being has the best layout in the valley..  Tranquil, multi level, professional ... and great hiding places if you want to avoid over-hearing true life comparisons to the "fifty shades of grey" book.  (Side note: .. after overhearing so many of these stories... it's clear people are sheltered and not well traveled).  The Men's facilities are modern, masculine & very clean.  Grooming amenities are not highly scented or offensive.  Full services include swiss shower, steam, jacuzzi, cold plunge, sauna and eucalyptus inhalation room.  The "shaving bar" turns a chore into a pleasure!    They have an awesome custom designed co-ed hydrotherapy / waterfall area, which has about 5 different waterfalls.  Each one is specifically engineered to provide focused / defined pressure and therapies to the guest... unfortunately some people don't realize the engineering marvel and tend to "linger & chat" thus delaying others from using the therapy for its intended purpose.   The entire staff is always professional and inherently willing to go above and beyond. I have never encountered a rude or condescending staff member, which is so common in that industry.  I've only booked the same massage therapist and that's Dan... I have no reason to see anyone else; he is a true professional, with the skill and background to ensure a truly effective session!    The lunches are always good...but I have to thank god that the cob salad is on the menu, That's my choice to ensure I get a good sized meal, that is not completely "spa stripped" of the typical manly enjoyments of fat and flavor.     I hope that this review has both interested the serious and frightened off the groups of loud, obnoxious people that want an inexpensive avenue to recognize a special someone.

GRANDMA !!!!!! ARE YOU BACK IN THAT KITCHEN?? GET OUT OF THERE!!!   That's basically how I always describe this place.. "Its grandma breakfast"... you know fresh, cooked to order, and way too much!   I have always loved Matts and have been coming for many years...the only thing I hate.. the wait.. (well, that and the unfinished, sloppy paint job in the dining room)   The food is ALWAYS great here... their pork products are amazing! Super fresh cage-fee chicken eggs, local produce and hearty THICKLY sliced breads served with a side of strawberry lavender preserves... yummy. If you're not in a hurry and have the time to endure the wait... this place is HIGHLY recommended!   Although my grandma left me many years ago... her breakfast spirit lives here!

Although I've been coming to LGO forever, I never really talked about it... It was there... everyone knew about it... but now... it seems like LGO is going global...   I'm thinking its going to be the next Starbucks... I'm sure plans are already in the works for LGO Bangalore!   They're opening a Postino down the street from me in Central Phoenix !! YEAH... I'm really tired of FEZ.. I can only hope that they change the C-Back/Central corner much they way they changed Arcadia!!   Well, went there last night with my buds and thought we have some of their FANTASTIC white sangria and their wings.. In my opinion... The food of the Gods! OK, yeah... I could have gone to wing-street... or KFC... But as god as my witness... the combo of Sangria and Wings ...mmmmmmmm...   First of all the wings are plump, juicy, large wings... grilled with a savory sauce unlike any I've ever had. Served with a home-made cheesy ranch dip... YUM.. coupled with a house salad.. Wooooo!   The Sangria is AWESOME! Fresh fruit, smooooooth finish.... I can never have just 4... yum...Watch out for Thursday night Cougar nite... they seem to be everywhere! If you dig that stuff... you will be in total heaven!

Pei ... have you lost your Wei?   Not sure what was going on last night... working late, so called over to "my" Pei Wei to grab a Pei Wei spicy Chicken with Brown Rice and Salad Rolls... Well, they have the Chicken, NO Salad Rolls... funny....now I don't even see them on the menu... So, with great disappoint I ordered pot-stickers... guess what... out of them also... weird... how do they run out of these items at 7 PM?   So I just go with the Spicy Chicken ... fine, but noticed a lot less chicken and MUCH smaller sized chicken chunks then normal... The host assured me that this was an isolated instance... but I wonder... things seem to changing everywhere. The favor was the norm... sweet yet spicy glaze with breaded chicken... my favorite... not bad all in all... I'm sure my doctor would say otherwise!... ENJOY!

THIS IS A MAGIC POST-OFFICE...   First... let me say:   Their FULL SERVICE Hours are...  Mon-Fri 8:00-9:30pm Sat 9:00-5:00pm  -- NOTE -- Double Check the Full Service Hours before running out there... rumor has it the hours may be changing!  Second... I drop a Netflix in the drive through box by 6:00 PM weekdays, Netflix sends out my new DVD the very next day! THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!

This Quick Trip, by FAR is my favorite QT..  Right on the Corner of Highland and 16th Street!   The inside of this store is always bright and clean, the help here is SUPER FAST!! The pumps always work and the window wash stuff is always full of liquid and paper towels.   I think there is a sense of pride at this QT that sets it apart from the pack!   The only thing about the place that I'm not a fan of... is the fact the Phoenix Police set up their DUI van and satellite arrest area in the far end of their parking lot on Thursday through Saturday  nights...

Just say NO to Tammy Coe...   Ok.. I thought that Tammy Coe had good cupcakes... That has all changed now....Today I'm driving along Scottsdale Road and out the corner of my eye... I see the word... "CUPCAKE"... a U turn later I've got a red velvet cupcake in my mouth.. Sorry Tammy... Sprinkles cupcakes blow yours away... These are unlike any cupcake I ever had... as if the cake was baked by the Hindu Goddess Annapurna and the icing was made from unicorn tears.   As one would imagine, its pricey to have a goddess create food that could inspire a symphony... (4 for 14.00)... but in the grand scheme of things... its a small price to pay to eat food baked with the spirit of holiness!   Kids... start saving your pennies... they are worth every cent!

Mediocre... that's the best I can give this place. Maybe I'm jaded, maybe my expectation levels are too high, maybe I give accurate reviews that are not influenced... who knows.   I have been coming to Switch since the day they opened the new dining room and were serving 1/2 priced entrees (due no liquor licence). In my opinion, they never progressed or evolved. I never suggest this place when going out, but for some reason, my friends who live in the 'hood like the food here. What disappoints me is the fact that we walk right past Durant's to get here... my heart drops every time, knowing that I could be in Durant's enjoying a really great meal.   Here at Switch...I personally... love..love...LOVE  the Italian Sodas (Drunken sodas) .. tall, frosty fruit flavored vodka drinks, that are made like and taste like an Italian soda.. AWESOME! ( Even better during happy hour for half the price). Aside from the sodas... I can honestly say that I've only had one excellent meal here... and that was many years ago and they have since taken the item off the menu. (Sliced grilled fillet in a yummy cream based sauce).. everything else on the menu is pretty ordinary and not worth ordering again.   I've eaten most everything on the menu in search of SOMETHING that I would really enjoy and would order more that once... I have yet to find it.. the only items that I will order is the bruschetta Duet, Hummus and the cheese and fruit plate. All of them are fresh, tasty and of generous size.   Someday..... soon I hope..... I want to find something soooo yummy on the menu, that  it will be me that suggests Switch as my choice for dinner... until then, I will continue to search...

This bar reminded us of the " Mos Eisley Cantina " .. you know... the bar featured in the Star Wars movie... where Han Solo is found.   Strange place... large, very much a renovation in progress.. and has been for quite sometime. I think they are attempting to duplicate the interior of "1313 Mockingbird Lane"... I've been told that this bar was owned by the same people who own Amsterdam.. which I find hard to believe since its SUCH a departure from Amsterdam.   I was told by a friend to check this place out ( again ) ... that it got allot better... hmmm not sure what he meant by that. I was hoping that Stacy would be working, since I heard he was working there... but much to our dismay he was not. The drinks were decent, although unsure why they have 2 or 3 different styles of "rocks" glasses, we kept getting our drinks mixed up.   I'm gonna try this bar again.. maybe during the week for happy hour.. Maybe I just went on an off night and update the review...

Bliss, Delight, Contentment... words to describe our evening Monday night at Sens. I could go into a very fluffy review, but, with a nod to the simple zen-like restaurant, I will only address and highlight.   ~Spa Like atmosphere - welcomed and enjoyed. ~Attentive, but not aggressive server...great attitude!  ~The Bar Menu I expect to see if I go to heaven.  ~Homemade infused alcohol.. finally in Phoenix!  ~Open kitchen, I was able to watch the chef CRAFT my meal.   All items served "tapas" style... great opportunity to try many items!   Food is prepared and served to allow the diner to choose the experience... either enjoy the food natural, or enhance with dipping sauces. These are not the heavy, sticky sauces of Pei Wei fame.   ~Mango Spring roll.. light, fresh items in rice paper 2 rolls sliced   ~Soup Gyoza, 4 little light dumplings filled with pork and a delicate broth..divine!   ~Volcano Beef sear your own tender beef strips (5) on the hot stone, then wrap it up in a lettuce leaf with herbs and peanuts,... try a dip of the accompanying sauce...ecstasy, prepare to order 2 they're so good!   ~Panko Shrimp - liken to little shrimp "hushpuppys".. very good, but not the highlight of the evening.. Mr Chu could improve upon these in my opinion.   ~ Red Thai Curry - 4 unique, yummy curry / coconut milk dipped wings perched on a Asian "slaw"   ~Spicy Wontons - Americans will love these.. familiar flavors, with wonderful dipping sauces.   No-one in our party was disappointed... everyone was very pleased and anxious to return.    ** Personal Suggestion ***  Have a food allergy ?? .. Use common sense when dining. Take personal responsibility and ask questions of your server BEFORE ordering.

"No, they're not fried... they're Wok'd"   (picture it.....the original Hairspray movie....this was said to me with the same inflection and tone of  Tracy Turblad when speaking to her Geometry Teacher about her hair.. "Its feathered....not ratted")     True Food is a better choice for other people.   I finally was able to eat here... as most everyone I know has already been here and raved.  Why?  That.. I'm not sure about.   The place has warm inviting "butter" tones with wood accents that all come together to create this bright and spacious restaurant.  It features an "exposition" style kitchen with basic comfortable seating.    The first thing I noticed was the STAFF! ... so many..... so available... so...so... Visible.  There was no place for the staff to hide and compare notes on bad tippers or to avoid refilling your water.  Quickly looking around the place, I counted 14 servers, a few bartenders and a few bus/host persons... all to serve about 60 of us that were in for an early dinner (6:30).  The restaurant, when full, seats 120. The staff moved about the place like a dance troupe (yes.. in all sense of the word) , all young , fresh , energy infused servers..Smiling, helping each other out.. it was kinda sickening to see such a large group get along so well... I'm thinking that antidepressants are served with the employee meals.    I noticed a great perk in the refreshments menu, you can add a shot of organic vodka to any of the natural drinks for a $3.00 up charge!  See mom... you were totally wrong.. Drinking CAN be healthy!!  We started our meals with the Shrimp Dumplings and the herb hummus.  When I asked if the dumplings were steamed or pan fried our waiter replied "No, they're not fried... they're Wok'd"... silly me and all this time I thought a wok was a pan.    The plump wok'd dumplings were very good, served in a mild mushroom broth with cilantro and scallions  ($10) the creamy hummus was delicious with fresh pita ($8).  The "salad" in the menu's description was basically just a small bit of salad place on top of the 2/3c portion of hummus.  Impressed by the apps were really looking forward to the entrees.  Being pressured to choose an entree, I opted for the steak tacos ($14) (What the hell was I thinking? ), my friends ordered the butternut squash ravioli with mushrooms ($13)  and also the natural pan roasted chicken ($18).  2 losers 1 winner arrived...I shouldn't say losers... because, they were ok... just not equal.     The steak tacos were just that... YAWN... I blame myself for not taking the time to review the menu.  2 large steak tacos with a large side of yummy, spicy Anasazi beans.. if I closed my eyes and tasted the tacos, I don't think I could tell if I were at Baja Fresh or True Food... Honestly.. Order the chicken.  The Squash Ravioli were very good, but it was agreed by all that the sweetness of the filling did not pair very well with the scrumptious (yes... scrumptious)  mushroom sauce.  What a shame, the sauce over simple pasta would have fared better in our eyes.  The star of the night, or shall I said DIVA... was the chicken... OH MY GOD.. who would have guessed a boneless, free range chicken would be soooooooooo delicious.  The chicken was pan fried to perfection (skin on to retain moisture) with a light savory seasoning, served over farro (a new whole grain for me).    THIS WAS THE MOST DELIOUS CHICKEN I HAVE EVER EATEN..so very juicy, the flavors so subtle ,  I was pissed the server did not steer me in that direction.   We all ended up eating the chicken since we were all impressed by it.  I hear that the Kale salad paired with the pan roasted chicken is the meal of the gods.    All in all we enjoyed our time there.. but not over the top impressed... I can tell you we will never order the ravioli or tacos again.. but the kale salad and the chicken...that's a different story.  I hear from the manager that the restaurant will be getting tons of attention from both local and nationwide media, so this concept might become the next healthy Chili's.  When leaving the restaurant we noticed a "protected" private dining area in the back of the place... may want to inquire if you're with a larger group.

This space has GREAT potential... The question is...will it ever achieve it ??    I applaud the "vision" of Karl Kopp, I feel he preserved the original architectural elements of the building, while finally catapulting the central Phoenix's bar /restaurant scene into 2008.  Finally an upscale restaurant and bar that actually looks like money went into the renovation... Ikea purchased items were not identified here.     The main "lobby" bar/restaurant on the first floor is huge... anchored by a large square bar in the center of the room... the ceiling soars above... a perfect space for an art installation.  The room is basically divided into a 60/40 bar/dining area with the main focus on the bar area.    Speaking of the bar area... strange place... although the seating at the bar is exceptional, several standard bar features are missing... The standard visual liquor selection is nowhere to be found, and the bartender was at a loss for the choices of vodka.  I'm not sure where they bought their martini glasses... they are NOTHING close to the "birdbath" martini  size of AZ88...perhaps someone confused the martini glass order and shipped out eye wash cups... I'm thinking that these are not the standard size  and it was all just a very evil joke! (Hint... if you enjoy olives in your martini... order them on the side.  Once  the spear of olives is removed from the drink,  the drink then becomes half empty... exzageration?  fabrication? Order one and decide for yourself)  Speaking of size..check out the enormous medieval torture device in the center of the bar... oh wait... I'm sorry... it's an industrial size prosciutto slicer.. Silly me.  Bevnaps where never used, perhaps they have not been stocked yet??   The restaurant table service was spotty, if not aloof.  This type of attitude works great after the restaurant opens and introduces the red rope / bouncer.. my opinion... first learn how to wait on tables, then concentrate on affecting (or should I say...perfecting) the attitude.    The "deconstructed" prosciutto and melon plate we ordered was nothing special, the crisp bread pizza type app was ok.. again, nothing exciting here.  Well, that's not true.. as there IS something exciting in this bar... The bathroom area on the mezzanine level!!.. mirrors and white hot lighting ensures that if you look "good" in that lighting... you'll look "GREAT" in the soft lighting of the bar area.    The balcony seating area in my opinion would be better used as a low seating area rather than a dining area. One can only hope that the upper floors will be used for live music and outdoor seating.  The basement should be opening soon, potentially a moshpit dance area? Who knows..  If you've been to Swigg in Santa Fe, you'll feel right at home here... Check it out, give it a try... or wait until they "weed out" the bad help and get the place up to speed.

**** OUTSTANDING ****   Whenever I need to "get a away" but don't have the time to actually pack up and travel, I book a massage and spend the afternoon at Joya.   The Joya spa is immense, but not intimidating... the decor is Moorish luxury at its finest,. Although many spas have attempted a "theme" none have applied it as well as Joya. The environment is soothing and authentic without being overbearing or tacky.   I suggest to arrive an hour and a half early, to relax, swim, enjoy some beverages at the private spa pool on the 2nd floor ( breath taking views of Camelback mountain ) and enjoy the facilities. Relax in the spacious facilities... including steam room and hot tub then follow with a cold "deluge" shower. Imagine 5 gallons of chilling water released all at once... amazing!!.....it "shocks" your body back into reality. Then hang out in the lounge area, watch some TV, enjoy some fruits, tea or water and wait for your treatment.   Although the entire staff at the spa is fantastic, for me, the shining star of the massage staff is Jean Baptiste. His technique is brilliant! I always feel GREAT after his massages, which I cannot say about past massages at other spas here in the valley. I find his massages to be intense, yet relaxing, he pinpoints and addresses stress areas in seconds... its like having a Physical Therapist, Sports Medicine and Masseur all at once. OUTSTANDING!   Inquire about their current Spa Happy Hour, a massage for about $115.00 including tip...and if you plan it right, you can be rested and out the door by 5:30P to walk over to the MBAR for their happy hour!   Imagine...two Happy Hours in one day.. a quarter of the way to having a Lindsy Lohan lifestyle!

Cherry Bar...   Don't be swayed by the name... Its a man's bar....  no, no stripper pole!  I wasn't sure what to expect, when I walked in, but when I was greeted by the familiar face of Tom, the bartender ( His abilities are legendary from Padlock and Friends) I knew I was gonna be quite happy!   Prior to being baptized "Cherry Bar" ... the place was most recently named "Friends"... it had a great staff and location, but lacked an identity. I understand that changes are underway, and a lot can be expected in the future from the new owners, including a completed outdoor patio area and interior remodel. Personally, I'm happy to see their Men's bathroom is modern, clean and well lit. ( unlike another nameless bar on 7th Street just North of Missouri ..YUK !!!)   They also have some awesome drink specials going on.. I was there on a Thursday night... and it was 2-4-1... other specials are Mojito Mondays $4.00 until 11...with karaoke starting at 9! and $5.00 well Martinis on Wednesday! And Every night is 2-4-1 from 11PM until close!   So... I'll be here often...... it has a lot of potential... and besides... If you ask... Tom will shake the hell out of your martini the way it should be... frosty cold!

WOW... What is going on here... This place has only been open a month, and the crowds are packin in!  When the bar was named "Friends"... the patrons were pretty much in the "over 40" age group... ( keep the yaps SHUT ).. and the place was empty after 9 PM.    That was then......  Now this place is a TRUE mix of ages and backgrounds, and has been packed every night I've been there ( even midweek ).    I have to admit... I like the bar and NEW friendly bar staff ...better and better each time I go (is it me or are some of the bartenders SUPER cute? ) ... the only thing though... its hard to find a chair now.

Chestnut Lane Fine Foods & Provisions ( Next to Havana Cafe )   What a great little space, and what a great concept. I stopped in today since I drive by this tiny little "house" almost every day and was a bit curious. Much to my dismay, the place was just closing up.   I did not get to enjoy anything.. yet, but I was able to speak with the owner for a few minutes. First of all... there was NOTHING left to eat... most everything was sold out... that says it all. I was told that the focus here is fresh, premium ingredients using organic and local businesses whenever possible. The menu includes Sandwiches, Salads, Home Made Soups and yummy looking sweets!    -- update--   I tried the Corn Chowder soup today, SUPER fresh, creamy, delicious... served with fresh grated white cheddar and a nice sourdough roll ... yummy!...

Great place to escape the norm!   We knew this placed opened last month, and have not had a chance to enjoy it. So last night we made our way over to Doc's to check it out..   we got there early... 7:30, so it was that weird "in-between" time ..so the place was not packed yet. Doc's has a bar/DJ room.. and then they also have the Dinner/Show room. We had a few drinks in the Bar/DJ area, it was great to have a DJ in an upscale bar. Our bartender was awesome, attentive and sociable.   When the band started playing in the Dinner/Show room, we went over there to check it out... just outside the two rooms is a large patio with a nice fire pit, lit and warm! This is one of the nicest smoking area's I've ever seen in Arizona and with the windows to the show bar open, you can enjoy the music outside!   The band was great, and the staff warm and friendly. We shared a HUGE plate of the Grilled Chicken bow tie pasta... Grilled chicken atop bow tie pasta, with tons of veggies all stirred up in a creamy garlic sauce...YUMMY!!!!!! The pate was more then enuf for two. It was great to relax, enjoy a nice meal and watch a great jazz band. We understand from other patrons, that they often come to hear Nayo Jones sing, they say she is awesome. We can wait to come back and see her.   The location cannot be beat... just a short walk from the Light Rail stop.   Happy hour is Tues-Sat 5:00PM to 7:00PM and we hear their "Salsa Thursdays" 8:00pm-? (5.00 cover) are great!   Even if you have dinner somewhere else, this is a great place to come and relax and listen to some really good music afterwords.. no cover Fridays and Saturdays!!!

High on Attitude...Low on Service..  By this point, I would have imagined Postino would running better then a Patek Philippe watch....That was not the case last night.    My suggestion... Give Postino Central time to hire a service focused staff with a sense of urgency before you come here.   The arrival of Postino in my 'hood was highly anticipated.  I was hoping the new "central" location would be "inspired" by Postino... not an Exact replica.. Which was a little boring!  We arrived at 7:30 to a full bar.. Which, a full bar is nothing new for this restaurant group, so why did it seem so chaotic?   We found some seats at the bar and waited to be served... and waited... and waited... we counted 3-4 on bar staff... yet the "main'" bartender seemed pre-occupied, and easily distracted.. AHAD?  We were finally acknowledged after 10 mins and placed our orders.    As we looked around, we noticed others at the bar with either an empty drink or no drink at all. (Amazing that the owner was monitoring the restaurant, however did not pick up on the fact so many at the bar had to wait so long for service)   There was one lucky group at the bar, ( We think they were the original cast from  the movie Sixteen Candles  ) that enjoyed exceptional service and attention.. Full drinks at all times, maintaining the bartender's attention as the rest of the patrons suffered.  Perhaps they hypnotized or used voodoo on the staff... Hey ...whatever it takes... I guess I'll go to a graveyard and kill a chicken at midnight before my next visit!   The bruschetta we ordered was great, the same quality as the Campbell location.  Warm, thickly sliced artisan bread, covered with generous amounts of toppings.  Our favorites were the prosciutto, Fig and mascarpone cheese and the Apple & Brie.. yummy!!!  The food was the only reason I gave this night a 2 star.    Although we fought our better judgment to leave after we enjoyed  our food... we stayed.  Big mistake!  We foolishly thought  once Jake Ryan and Caroline Mulford left the bar , the voodoo spell would be broken, that was not the case...the wait for the following drinks were just as lengthy as the first!  If I were the owner, .. I'd replace the Bar Staff with the Valet Staff.. The Valet Staff was quicker, service focused  and had more personality then anyone at the bar..  I look forward to returning back to Postino Central when they have "ironed out" the "kinks"..

A missed opportunity ....   I was excited that the LGO heritage was going to invade my 'hood (again)... BIG MISTAKE... tonight was a disappointment .... I encouraged my friends to join me at Gallo to see what new and exciting things are  being offered by Doug  Robson (of LGO fame) here are Gallo .... YAWN!  First ...lemme say... I felt the staff was great... granted.. there were only 20 people in the entire restaurant;...our server was attentive and visible.     I reviewed the menu prior to arrival, so I gently advised my buds that it's not a full service restaurant,  per sea , but more of a "snack stop".   We arrived and were quickly seated; we ordered the guacamole as an appetizer, which we all enjoyed.  The  guac  arrived with a pairing of enhancement sauces which appealed to all.  The chips for dipping were extremely light and flavorful, the highlight of the meal in my opinion.  Using caution and sticking to just tacos, the three of us ordered a mix of all of the Tacos and one ordered the Cheeseburger.    The tacos arrived promptly after the appetizer, the tacos neatly presented in an accordion type metal rack. Although aesthetically pleasing, the rack was not warmed, so it basically "stole" the heat from the tacos.  Thank god it did not steal the flavor, which,...I have to say... was very nice... not FANTASTIC.. but very good.  The pork was great, nice and juicy with a somewhat sweet tang, the Carne Asada, were perfect in my opinion.. the Vegetable tacos.. very flavorful... considering it was just veggies.    My bud who ordered the hamburger was REALLY disappointed... he claimed it not cooked according to his request (medium) but very rare.  He did give kudos for presentation, but that was about it.    Would I come here again???.. perhaps.. but not to bring a first date or impress my boss... I might however, come here after a heavy night of drinking when the tummy is grumbling.  I'm hoping that Doug will "shine" in a few months and present a new menu with integrity and virtue.   I am kinda perplexed  by all the GREAT reviews of Gallo,... Many of the Yelpers have given this restaurant overwhelming great reviews... my question...is WHY???

I'm not sure where some of these reviewers normally take their cars for routine maintenance and repairs.. but it must not be a quality place... if you think that the prices here are high or out of line, then you have been living in Hooterville too long.    I thought the prices were great... AAA even had coupons on their site..  The staff were all very attentive and took the time to understand my problem and listen to my feedback on what needs to be done.. I found the price I paid today was very reasonable.. Hell... they even shuttled me home and picked me back up again!

We came in Friday night to relax a bit and catch up.. we thought the place was great!  ( My friends did mention the bar was cleaner then most in the city )  We enjoyed great drinks and flattering lighting.   Although Stacy was not behind the bar that night, the staff did a good job with the service.   The crowd was pretty damm attractive, which is always a good thing.... We'll be back..that's for sure!!!
