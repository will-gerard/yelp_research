Out of the few airports I've been to around the country, mostly major hubs (NYC, Atlanta, Milwaukee, Chicago, Denver, LA, Houston, Phoenix, etc), Phoenix is good enough for me.  Take the TSA out of any airport and I'd be happy to rate all of them at least one star higher, but regardless, Phoenix is a fairly easy airport to navigate and I don't dread my time spent there.  I'm one of those paranoid travelers that absolutely must be at the airport 2 hours before my flight "just in case," so I always have time to kill when I'm leaving town.  That's where the FREE WIFI comes in, am I right?  The shops are boring and overpriced, but for tourists who need last minute souvenirs, they're safe and definitely give off a southwestern vibe.  I appreciate the North/South sides of the terminals, as it seems to help with congestion, and when parking in the exterior lots, the free shuttle buses are consistently regular.  It's also easy to drop off/pick up people with a convenient road that loops around if you missed your passenger.  The cell phone lot is a place to get familiar with, as it's super conveniently located right at the entrance and there's a nice big lit sign that shows all of the planes and their ETAs within a few hours time frame.  Also, the proprietors of this airport are currently in the process of adding more local flair to the different terminals (namely the US Airways terminal) and have partnered with a few favorite local restaurants to create a more..."on the go" feel for them without sacrificing quality.  I personally haven't been to any of them yet, but I like the concept of keeping AZ a destination for local love.

As much as I dislike shopping at the big chain stores, in a pinch, this place has what I'm looking for at any given time.  I do appreciate that they host adoption events, and they hold cats from local rescues in the store everyday, so other than my wishing the cats had more room to roam (yes, I know, unfortunately it's not really practical in a retail space) - this store gets my approval.  Everything is clean, the dog training classes are well-managed, most of the popular items are well-stocked, and most of the employees can actually help when asked for assistance.  I also like that you can donate money to shelters right at the register when you're paying, so there aren't any extra transactions.    I've only had one or two experiences with the vets in the Banfield Veterinary side, but the staff was nice, helpful, and accommodating - despite wanting to upsell some of the procedures and pushing to schedule future visits.    This store also has a grooming room, which seems to always be busy, so I can only assume they are thorough and attentive to the dogs brought in - however I have no personal experience with it.    Overall, while I'd rather shop at the local pet stores, if I can't find what I want there, I'll come here, and I have yet to have an unpleasant experience!

Having never delved into the fabulous world of pho before, and finding myself a bit under the weather, I was instructed by a friend (who I now consider very wise) to head over to Saigon Pho and grab some pho.  Since my initial visit, Saigon Pho has introduced me to the brothy wonders of Vietnamese soup.  I regularly call in to order for pick up, and it's always ready within 15-20 minutes.  The broth and meat of choice (to go) comes in a huge styrofoam (Argh!  But what can you do?) cup and all of the fixins - basil, sprouts, rice noodles, lime, sauces, jalepeños - come in a separate box so you can mix to your liking.    Basically, if you're having a low-key movie night at home and don't want to cook, but don't want to stuff your face with fatty foods, you'll want to order something from here (I recommend the chicken or beef pho) on your way home.  And don't forget the spring rolls...they are unique in flavor and texture despite being made with the standard ingredients.  I'm not sure what it is, but it almost tastes like they brush the wrapper with almond extract, really delicious!    While I'm still exploring my pho options, this place is so conveniently close to my house, I won't feel bad using it as a fall back if I ever find somewhere better.

It's...a Target.  It's right across the street (Frye) from the Chandler Fashion Center and will most likely have what you're looking for just in case you don't want to clod through herds of scantily clad tweens and moody teenagers or your run of the mill mall sheep.    Other than that, and on a more serious note, they have pretty much everything you'd expect from a big Target: pharmacy, photo, grocery, everything else, and alcohol (including some local craft beers!).    What else do you need, right?

After wandering into Liberty Market on a Saturday while looking for a place to have brunch, I decided I may never leave.  Then I came back for lunch a week later, and decided to never leave again.  Having frequented Liberty Market now probably, ohhh...10+ times - always on weekends and always for breakfast/lunch, I'm dubbing it my go-to weekend meal.  I'm not normally a breakfast person, but this place has changed my mind many times over, especially when it comes to flavor, plus they've got something for everyone.    There is almost always a constant line that can easily be 15-30 people deep at any given time, but it moves steadily and you never really feel like you're waiting and there's always a seat ready for you by the time you order.  Depending on when you walk in, menus are available for breakfast, lunch or dinner (or both breakfast and lunch if you come in on the weekend between 10am and 1pm) and you can peruse the menu at your leisure while you wait to shuffle up to the register to order.  As you amble through the line, you snake along a tall cooler full of beverages from cans of limonata and bottles of exotic juices and sodas to cans and bottles of craft beer (including some local).  Further along the line you'll pass the pizza making station, where you can watch the cooks toss dough and unique toppings around before gently thrusting a fresh-made pizza into the brick oven (you could even watch it bake if you aren't in a rush...or hungry).  Right after the pizzas, the sides/appetizers and desserts taunt you from a cooler covered with glass that seems to sparkle thanks to all the delicious treats inside.  Just before you can take a look, someone will come up to you and give you a number while pointing out your table for you.  Then you can admire the caprese pasta salad, roasted sweet potato salad, corn-tomato-and-bean salad, hummus, fresh fruit and vegetables of the day, zebra brownies, carrot cake, bread pudding, red velvet cake, ice cream cookie sandwiches, and a cupcake of the day.  When you finally get to the register to order, food is the first thing on your mind and you can't wait to try everything.  Also, if you're looking for some caffeine...order the cortadito.  Just do it.  I could go on and on, but basically, the food is delicious and the wait times are manageable (the food arrives within 10-15 minutes after you sit down, if that).  It's not too fancy and it's definitely not plain, and yet it still avoids being pretentious while staying in the "just right" zone.  I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's accurate.    Quick tip: they do not have a mist system outside, so they don't normally sit people on the patio in the summer, but it's well-shaded, so if you have a dog with you or just want to be away from everyone inside, they will sit you out there, you just have to ask.

Slightly touristy in that there's a lot of memorabilia scattered around the place, not to mention a tank with rattlesnakes right when you enter and an old west town made up of prop store fronts and a stage for live music out back, but other than that, it's all history.  The restaurant has been around since 1957 according to the website, and the history is pretty evident upon first glance.  The cieling is covered in snipped neckties and business cards dating back decades - just look for the dustiest ties and the yellowest cards, you'll see what I mean.  Along many of the interior walls there are hundreds of beer related trinkets, tap handles, old label artwork, bottle caps, old photos of the first breweries, and unique bottle openers.  It's a pretty interesting place to just walk around (and, of course, there's a gift shop for all your last minute christmas gifts).    There's also a local brewery attached to it, Sonoran Brewing Company, and all of their beers are served at the restaurant.  I recommend trying their Inebriator Stout and the Victorian IPA if you like craft beer or your tastebuds could use a wake-up call.    The food isn't oh-my-gawd amazing, but it's good.  The steaks are consistent with just the right amount of fat and good flavors if you order them medium, the ribs fall off the bone and melt in your mouth just like they should, and the chicken tastes like chicken if you didn't come to a steakhouse for steak.

Despite the fact that this IMAX screen is in the hottest mess of a mall (seriously.  hot.  mess.), it's really not a bad place to catch a flick.  I agree with some of the other reviewers here, paying $30+ bucks just for tickets can be a bit daunting and definitely helps keep those with subpar public decency skills out.  I have a love/hate relationship with all the movies coming out and made specifically for 3D, but I can't deny that it is an awesome experience when you're facing a gigantic screen and you feel like you're a part of the movie.  The concession stand is slightly dismal and the fluorescent lights aren't helping that situation, but they offer some hot foods (pretzels, hot dogs) alongside the popcorn and candy (if that's your thing).  It is kept clean and they make an announcement before every showing to remind you to shut off your phone and respect the other patrons, which is nice.  I do wish there was another IMAX in the valley, Phoenix is a big enough city for multiple venues, but this place fits the bill.

While I have not had the pleasure of dining nor playing golf here, I have been at a few events on the golf course.  Everything is top of the line and very expensive while remaining exclusive to the members (and people with lots of money).  Pools, tennis courts, multiple dining areas and private clubs/bars throughout the property, as well as the expansive golf course - there is always a caddie or cart driver to cater to your every need (again, as a member).  The grounds are very well kept, and the rules are followed to a T.  All of the staff are very polite and helpful, and most of the members are rather indifferent, but there is a particular air of pretentiousness in all of that.  Either way, I don't normally live among the wealthy or "upper class," so it fits the cliches.

Definitely a great idea if you have family or friends visiting and want to show them some of the more beautiful aspects of this state!  My dad was visiting for his birthday, and being from Wisconsin, we both love the water, so without easy access to another lake (read: no boat), I decided to take him on a relaxing desert cruise.  The captain was very informative and answered everyone's questions, including what kinds of fish were in the lake.  The views were gorgeous, especially at the end when you can see the Four Peaks shimmering in the distance.  We saw a few hawks and eagles, learned about the local vegetation (including a really cool clubbed saguaro), found out when the fishing season was and enjoyed some great local beers (Four Peaks) on the boat.  The inside of the boat is climate controlled, the front gets filled up very quickly, and while the top deck is well-shaded, the end seats can get pretty hot in the warmer months.  The breeze was lovely and all of the staff were attentive and friendly.    Granted, it's not the most scenic or exciting thing in the world, but if you appreciate local tidbits, a calm atmosphere, and spending time on the water, you might want to check it out.  (Sidenote:  They do have handicap accommodations, including a ramp to the boat deck, for what it's worth)

After purchasing a voucher for 3 oil changes off of LiveSocial, I am happy to say this was a very pleasant experience.  I called on Friday to make an appointment for Saturday morning, and they scheduled me without any issues.  I showed up a little early for my appointment and was quickly greeted while my information was taken down.  After about 40 minutes or so, I was on my way with a well-lubed car and no issues whatsoever.  All of the guys were really friendly and knowledgeable and ready to answer any questions.  I'm glad I found this place, as it's super close to me and I have been searching for a go-to place for oil changes and general car maintenance.  I'll definitely be returning in the future!

Orange Table is a regular brunch spot for my husband and I.  We love dining al fresco, so any place that has outdoor seating (regardless of the time of year) is considered just right in our book.  We'd much rather enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather than cram ourselves indoors.  Orange Table is no exception, considering that it can get pretty noisy in the small indoor space, especially when you include families with small children or groups of college kids.   We've never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a table, inside or out, and the staff have never been anything but cordial to us.  The wait for food has always been minimal, and I haven't had to flag down a server for anything, as they're pretty attentive without being annoying.    I'm in love with their white flannel and eggs benedict, and if I'm looking for motivation for a nap later, you can bet I'll be ordering one of these two delicious items!  I do wish they made more flavorful bloody marys and included more (or any) fixings for them, but I can have brunch without alcohol and still survive, so hot chocolate and arnold palmers work just as well.    All said, it is a great spot to bring family when they visit, and can be very low key if you stop by late on Saturday mornings, or if you make it in before 10 on Sundays.  Brunch isn't meant to be rushed, so take your time and enjoy the morning!

Ugh.  Even if I was required to be at this event, I would probably try to skip out.  As others have mentioned, lots of costs for everything, and many they don't tell you up front.  First there's the entrance fee, then there's another fee to get into the alcohol areas, then they make you put money on an event debit card that you have to use throughout the event for tastings/samples.  So not only are you paying to get into the overall event, you are paying anywhere from $2-$6 for every one of your food samples (which are bite-sized, at best), and $1-$4 for a 4-oz beer or taste of hard alcohol, on top of whatever they charged you to enter the alcohol area.  Before you even get to try anything you've easily spent $40 per person.  All the while, it's sweltering hot because 3/4 of the event is on pavement/blacktop, and don't even bother trying to find water.  The lines are so long and water stations so few, I'd suggest smuggling your own in if you really must go to this event.  To add insult to injury, most of the food is from your run of the mill downtown Scottsdale bars.  Salty Señorita?  Grimaldi's?  Pita Jungle?  C'mon, those aren't culinary fest-worthy restaurants.  Not to rip on them or anything, but there are far fewer foodie delights than deserve to be at an event that touts itself as a culinary festival.    The one star goes to the people-watching, as everyone else has mentioned.  Plastic, decorated women teetering around in 6-inch heels and the miniest of miniskirts/dresses with cleavage popping in every direction while men in expensive golfing outfits and italian leather shoes act like they're on a casual outing...definitely a sight to behold.    If you must go, trick someone else into paying, or volunteer so you can at least get in for free.

I had no idea what a "pasty" was before coming here, and I was actually a little wary of trying something that sounded like nipple coverings.  Thankfully, Cornish Pasty is lacking tassels and the like, simply serving up deliciously magical pockets filled with wonderful themed concoctions.    My personal favorite is the reuben, where the pastrami and corned beef is tender, juicy and chewy at the same time, the buttery crust is perfectly flaky, and the 1000 Island dressing is something I enjoy smothering everything in.  I don't know that I've had a reuben in the valley that's comparable to how amazing this pasty is.  And the oven chips?  Forget about it!  Not that you need a side with the size of the pasties...Oh, the Apple Caramel Pasty is also pretty top notch for dessert - warm and gooey.  Their craft beer selection is also admirable, with a few local drafts (including Four Peaks and Oak Creek) and plenty of English-themed brews and English IPAs.  Full disclosure: as a beer geek, I only wish they didn't serve the beer in a frosted glass...it kinda affects the flavor.  Besides that, there is nothing I can complain about, especially since they recently expanded into the building next door, thus gaining about 5X the seating and space.  Much more comfortable, less claustrophobic, and easier to get around.

My boyfriend and I have been here twice now, and both times we weren't disappointed.  From the steak and burgers to the salmon and fries, everything tasted just as it should.  That might be a problem for some people who are looking for above average tasting food, but for someone who's just looking for a nice sit-down meal in a calm atmosphere after a long day, it's perfect.  Both times my steak was cooked just right, the fries were just crispy enough, the drinks (arnold palmer) were made with just the right amount of tea and lemonade.  J's salmon was flaky and his meatloaf was actually quite moist and delicious with the gravy.    Again, it is quite average, there are no over-the top flavours here, but it is safe and comfortable and the staff is more than accomodating (sometimes to the point where you will have 3 people helping each other with their tables) in every aspect.

I don't really know of any other game stores that can compare with GameStop...they have pretty much everything I could ever want.  Even when I don't know that I want it.   This particular location has really friendly, really helpful team members who are always eager and wiling to talk about any game in the store.  Many of them have personal experience with most of the games, systems, and extra products, so while they provide their opinion, they are also pretty good at remaining objective when giving an overview.    Being a ProMember saves me sooo much money (I'm almost embarrassed at how often I frequent this place. Almost), and allows me to trade in games for quite a bit more than if I weren't a member, while also allowing me to collect points I can use in their online store to purchase special items not in-store.  I love that they have such a huge selection of used games as well as all of the newest releases.  They are very up-front about what new titles are being released when, and take a simple $5 pre-order to hold onto a copy of anything that might be coming out (which then gets put towards the purchase of that game, so you're not losing money holding it).    Overall, this is a store I don't ever feel bad about spending too much time in when I'm looking for something to spend more time on.

Looking for a last minute Christmas gift that is both handmade AND local?  This is your one-stop shopping experience if quality and diversity matter to you.  The winter version of this festival is huge and hosts hundreds of vendors with plenty of beautifully creative pieces of art, clothing and jewelry, accessories, music, and lots of yummy food.  They also have wine and beer gardens with live music in between them, where you can sample local beers and wines from around Arizona.  Be prepared to walk a lot, but also take your time and stop into the local shops along the route, grab some lunch, and just peruse at your leisure.  This fest doesn't disappoint, but it is difficult to fit the whole thing into just one day, so if you don't find everything you hoped to see the first day, come back for a second round!

I have been a frequent shopper at Chandler WF for the past 2 years, and I have never had a bad experience.  Everything from the seasonal and LOCAL fruits and veggies to the frozen organic meals to the fresh sliced deli meats to the local baked goods and brick-oven pizza made just the way you want it (even with goat cheese) to the Watering Hole where you can try 30 delicious local and craft beers to the in-store restaurant (and grill) to the...well, you get the picture.    When I'm feeling lazy, I like to stop in and grab a fresh-made sub from the little sandwich making station between the Watering Hole and the Tapas bar before heading over to the Watering Hole to enjoy a fantastic beer.  I have expanded my taste buds so much since my first visit to this place that every time I go in I attempt to try something new.  I also really like that they've implemented the natural/healthy meter with their seafood, poultry, and meats (from green to red rating the meat between free-range, grass-fed and organic to caged, corn-fed, and antibiotic raised in the beef, lamb, pork, turkey and poultry - though you won't find any of the red there - and sustainability levels and farmed or wild in seafood).  It's all very informative.    This is my go-to grocery store, regardless of the prices.  I don't mind paying more for healthier, organic food that isn't mass produced, crammed with chemicals, or sent from overseas.  I love supporting local and I love finding out more about my community; Whole Foods Chandler is the place to do all of that and more.  (Not to mention, all of the employees are super friendly and many know us by name and never fail to greet us with a smile and a hug.  Awesome customer service!)

The staff is always so nice and accommodating with or without an appointment, the prices are excellent for the attentive service, the polish styles (gel, acrylic, shellac...) and colors are up to date and plentiful, the chairs are comfortable (even the bar stools at the nail bar, which earns extra points for creativity!), and everything is very clean.  The techs are very knowledgeable and eager to share information or give advice without upselling or being pushy, and not once have I been nicked or bled after a thorough mani/pedi.  Needless to say, this will be my go-to place as long as I'm in/near the Phoenix valley.

I can't make any claims of wealth, but when it comes to grocery shopping, I like to support local as much and as often as I can.  So when I'm not at the farmer's markets trying to put what money I do have back into the local economy, I'm at Whole Foods buying the products grown and made locally.  I'm also a huge supporter of organic, so short of being a rebellious hippie living off my parent's trust fund money or a trophy wife with nothing better to do (that's the Whole Foods stereotype, isn't it?), I will admit that I love trips to Whole Foods in most capacities.  This isn't my go-to Whole Foods - as I live in Chandler (lucky for me, the Chandler Whole Foods is just as awesome), however much I wish it was, but I can feel safe knowing that when I find myself in N Scottsdale/Phoenix/Glendale, I have this big hulking beauty of a grocer to visit for anything I may need.

Is it normal to want to bring your massage therapist home with you?  On the rare occasion I can fit a well-deserved massage into my schedule, I'd like all of them to be just as worthy as the time and money I spent at this place.  Husband and I decided we were in dire need of a relaxing pamper day, so I booked us a 90-min couple's therapeutic massage (~$170) at Touch of Tranquility.   The small entrance - I guess I would refer to it as a receiving room rather than a waiting room - was warm, cozy, and serene with an oversized leather couch, a small coffee table with magazines, lots of plants, and some shelves with products on them.  It didn't feel clinical in any way, and it reminded me more of someone's home office/living room.  We were offered water to sip on before our massages, and we barely waited 5 minutes after filling out our new patient information before our massage therapists introduced themselves and asked where we'd like them to focus.  Both of our therapists were wonderful, doing exactly what we asked and being extremely aware of our hints if something hurt or if they weren't putting enough pressure somewhere.  I generally enjoy my massages to be deep tissue quality, and I can safely say that while I was a little sore afterwards, the release of tension in my muscles allowed me to happily sigh my way through the end of the day.  My husband was just as impressed and even nearly fell asleep near the end!  I especially enjoyed that the head rests had a little sleeve of fabric under the hole so we didn't have to see the floor/their feet while they were doing our backs, and it smelled like eucalyptus.    Overall, very tranquil, attentive experience, we will be repeat customers for sure!

I'm not a big beauty product person, but I do like to pamper myself once in a while with a mani/pedi.  Decided to give this place a try since they offered gel polish and had certified technicians on staff, so I made a reservation.  Walking in wasn't too bad, but when they didn't have my reservation on file, when two different staff members tried to check me in, and when the "technician" didn't realize I had asked for two manis (my husband was with me and wanted a clean up), I tried not to worry.  As we sat down, our assigned manicurist, Lori, was extremely chipper and talkative and offered to do both of us at the same time.  After asking for my color in gel, she very casually questioned whether or not that was what I really wanted, said that it might be pretty, but that they had a whole other shelf of polish in the pedicure room.  I wasn't sure what to say, since I've never been questioned on my choice of nail color...so I went to check out the other colors.  While they have a ton of OPI and China Glaze polishes in lots of colors, I was there for gel, and when they didn't have the color I was hoping for in in gel, I had to go with regular polish.    I have nothing against regular polish, but my job is very hands on, and I don't enjoy paying $25+ to get my fingernails painted just to have them chipping in two days.  I ended up having to choose regular polish anyway, and by this time she was almost done with my husband's hands.  Long, painful story short...I found Lori really enjoys talking, cooking, spending time in the kitchen, talking, her children, her grandchildren, making her own food, her freedom in not needing a job - but wanting one, talking, her dutch heritage, and talking.  There was very little focus on the actual manicure, the massage was lackluster with no pressure and a lot of lotion, she never touched our cuticles, didn't clip our nails, gave my husband a file and buffing block to touch up what he wanted, and when she finally painted my fingers, it looked like a three-year old trying desperately to color inside the lines.  She never even acknowledged the paint all over my skin.    Regardless, we paid our $40 and left having learned a lesson that we will not be returning to Beauty Brands for personal care.  I didn't bother to look at any of the products in the store (though it seemed well-stocked and organized), but the sketchy service from what their website touts as professional certified technicians isn't something I'd like to deal with again.  There are plenty of smaller, local options that are much more attentive and do a better job for the same price.

Small, out of the way, but still really convenient when you need a pick-me-up.  I usually stop here on my way home after grocery shopping at Whole Foods, get a shaken iced black tea lemonade - no sweetener, and the rest of my evening is calm and relaxing.  The staff are always really pleasant to talk to and offer cheerful greetings whether it's through the drive-through or in the store.

I would gladly pay $5 for a popsicle from Paletas Betty!  Tried the amanecer (ripe pineapple with fresh raspberries) and the chocolate (Mexican hot chocolate with spices), both were absolutely fantastic (though it was extremely difficult to pick just one flavor - they all looked delicious!) My fiance and I couldn't stop looking at each other in awe after every bite.  The amanecer had the juiciest chunks of raspberry, despite being frozen, packed into what tasted like a fresh slice of pineapple.  The chocolate tasted exactly like Mexican hot chocolate with just a slight kick of chili powder and a little bit of something else, maybe coriander or nutmeg.  Either way, both were convincing enough that we will definitely be back.  Perfectly refreshing and the best way to end an evening in downtown Chandler.  They do now accept credit/debit cards, but it is expensive for the business, so if you don't usually carry cash, know that you can charge it.  I will most likely focus on paying cash to help out a small local business, plus - if I can get four amazing (seriously, I am out of adjectives to describe them) popsicles for under $10, I know I can carry at least that much in my pocket.

One of the best local businesses to grab a craft beer at! Not only do they have a wide variety of options that is constantly rotating, but they host monthly tap takeovers with different breweries from around the country, as well as local ones like Four Peaks and SanTan. The food is pretty good, too, and is much better than your average bar fare (my favorite: chipotle mac and cheese with grilled chicken). Plenty of TVs to catch the game and just enough seating where it doesn't feel crowded even when it's full (unless you're there on a tap takeover night, then you want to get there early!). The Flanigans are wonderful people who support their local community, so make sure you stop in and say hi.

Stopped here for the first time last weekend after following GFM on Facebook/Twitter for a while, and am now adding it to my dedicated calendar of things to do on the weekend.  I'll definitely have to practice getting up earlier, but this farmer's market is worth it.  I was really pleasantly surprised that there were so many different vendors - enough that I could plan my whole week out without getting bored of the selection!  Fruits and vegetables, beef and chicken, pasta and sauces, salsas, bread and cheese, soaps, jewelry and kid stuff.  And all of it grown, produced, and sold locally!  My only problem was that while 9 out of 10 vendors take cards, I never carry cash on me and I couldn't find an ATM anywhere nearby, and thus I had to woefully miss out on a few of the great items offered.  I'll make it a point to bring cash next time, but I honestly didn't expect to be going home with items from almost every vendor!  I think my favorite thing about visiting this market is that I now am aware of even more local businesses and families that I can support with my purchasing needs - even outside of the market!  Yay local!

What to say, what to say...I don't have many words that can describe my love for this place.  Hundreds of amazing alcohol choices - whiskey, bourbon, port, beer...you name it, they probably have it (or will be open to finding it).  As far as beer goes (since that's my specialty), they have lots of local options and are constantly doing promos and events with breweries and cigar companies.    Yes, it is usually a "sausage-fest" on any given night, but since I've been frequenting this place the past few months, I've noticed more and more women visiting; if not for the alcohol and cigars, then at least to accompany their husbands/boyfriends.  It's a really friendly place, so women - please don't be deterred just because there are a lot of men there.  The staff is knowledgeable about everything they sell, and there is always someone to keep the humidor running smoothly, so that even on event nights, there is never a long wait.    I love that I can go in there with what limited smoke knowledge I have, ask whatever questions I need to, and always get an answer without any judgements or attitude.  There is nothing snobby or pretentious about Fox Cigar Bar.  They will even give you advice in regard to which drinks pair with which cigars (while still allowing you the freedom to make your own tasty decisions).  While they don't serve food, many of the events they host include catered food, and there are some good restaurants around the area, so eat up before you go in.

I normally try to avoid dairy, but after eating across the street at Federal Pizza (and having tried Churn at Devoured a few weeks ago), I dragged my husband into this quaint little ice cream parlor.  By quaint, I mean small, but it is also full to the brim with every sweet piece of candy my childhood nostalgia could remember.  While I managed to restrain myself from emptying my bank account on Necco wafers, plastic army men, caramels, rice krispie treats, and local art, I was there for ice cream, and that's exactly what I got.    It was a tough choice between a strawberry shortcake sundae and a salted caramel freezie, but in the end I was directed towards the strawberry sundae.  It was super creamy, the strawberries were fresh, the whole thing was really flavorful, and there was enough to share (but who does that?  Get your own ice cream!), however - and this is my ONLY complaint - I was a little disappointed that the shortcake part of the strawberry shortcake sundae was actually shortbread cookies...not a soft fluffy piece of cake.  Alas, my pain didn't last for long thanks to the wonderful ambiance and delicious noms, and I will definitely return when I find myself up in this area again!

I was recently a part of a special tasting event and pounced on the opportunity to try 8 of their burgers paired with Four Peaks beers!  While I heartily enjoyed all 8 of the burgers (and their beery companions), I was especially surprised at how tasty the black bean burgers were.  My four favorite pairings were: mushroom and swiss burger with 8th Street, BBQ Bacon & Cheddar burger with Kilt Lifter, cucumber & goat cheese Chicken sandwich with Sunbru, and the Arizona Burger with Hop Knot.  Upon further exploration of multiple area Smashburgers, I can safely say that my happiness of being able to go to a fast food joint and get quality burgers with quality drinks is finally founded.  All of the staff I've encountered have been friendly and knowledgeable, and eager to serve, the restaurants have been clean and inviting, and the food has consistently been satisfying and delicious.  I really love that they provide so many options for burgers (beef, chicken, black bean), buns (egg, spicy chipotle, multigrain, lettuce), and plenty of sauces and toppings so you can truly enjoy your own creation.  What Smashburger is doing all across the country - partnering with local breweries/businesses to create an interesting and exciting local experience while retaining their national appeal - is what I have been hoping that Jimmy John's or Chipotle would do.  I guess this just proves that beer goes better with burgers!

I have to agree with Richard's review.  Also, Junk should try visiting New York instead of just stereotyping based on a select few.  My boyfriend and I walked into this place thinking it might help us transition a little easier to living in the southwest, as we've just moved here from New York City.  I'm originally from the Midwest, so I have no qualms about New York attitudes and food and J is very open to trying everything.  At first glance, it seems like it might be a nice place, though it is very dark, almost like a dive bar with no windows.  The hostess didn't immediately recognize us as customers as she was playing with her cell phone, so J tried to get her attention with a joke about native New Yorkers (the people, not the restaurant).  Her response was a hazy glance and a slow "what?" as she attempted to half-smile her way out of the situation.    Eventually we were seated in a room that looked like it was still waiting for decoration, lights, and maybe some barriers.  It was literally one big square room with about 20-30 tables strewn about and tiny uncomfortable booths lining the mostly windowless walls.  The kitchen opened into this one room via one of the corners, luckily we were seated across the room from it, though there didn't appear to be much going on.  We were there for lunch, though only about 3 other couples and a family with a horde of obnoxious screaming children were present for the meal, or lack thereof.  I immediately took note of the small portion sizes and the greasy sheen over everything, including the tables and seats.    By the time we got our menus, which were also dripping wet from just having been wiped down with a greasy rag, we weren't hungry.  The food on the menu is bland, boring all-American bar food:  plain old burgers, french fries, and finger food.  This isn't to say they didn't have spaghetti, BLTs and flash-fried fish, but I barely got past the first half of the menu before it slid out of my hand.  We didn't stay for food once our drinks (water, as we were never asked what we wanted to drink) arrived.  It was probably a one-time thing, but my water had bits of something floating in it, and it wasn't lemon.    Needless to say, I can't say anything about the food, but the service was completely lacking.  Also, I'm not a huge fan of dining in a greasy basement.

Really interesting place! Professional, but very relaxed environment. Has a good vibe with lots of fun, unique people. Also, men who do nails...and do them well? Yes please!

I hate to be the first to review this with such a negative rating, unfortunately opening day did not do the place justice.  I understand that opening on a Friday night has its perks - lots of business, great way to show your nightlife capabilities - and show off in general, fresh crowds and new people to bring in and form into regulars, etc, etc, however if you're going to open on a Friday and be understaffed, it's not going to go very smooth.    My fiance and I showed up around 7pm and were sat promptly outside with no wait, which was nice considering all of the people that were in the bar area.  We didn't notice anything suspicious, everything seemed to be in good order and the place was spotless as far as cleanliness goes.  Then we sat down with the menus and were left alone without a drink order.  10 minutes later, our waitress showed up and took our orders - Arnold Palmer and a Port Brewing Wipeout IPA.  Another 10 minutes passes and the Arnold Palmer and two waters show up, but no beer.  Apparently they're out of most of their craft draft and bottled beer due to their soft opening the night before.  Okay, I guess I'll order something else.  The waitress excuses herself before I can order a different beer and I watch as she takes orders from 5 other tables around us, runs to the bar and kitchen twice before returning with another Arnold Palmer.  I order a Ska beer. "Which one? We have two."  I know, bring me whichever one you have available right now.  She smiles and trots away before we can order food.  We sat for another 15 minutes before my fiance went up to the bar to order me a beer.  The waitress passed us three more times before she brought out a beer for me, Ska Pinstripe red ale in a bottle.  With no glass.  But at least she stuck around long enough for us to order some food.  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against sucking down a beer straight from the bottle, but I wasn't exactly drinking a Corona or a Bud Lite.  Even then, don't most sports bars - and bars/restaurants in general - provide a glass with a canned or bottled beer?  I can even look past if the glass is frosted (yes, I am a beer snob, it happens to be my line of work), but to have no option of drinking out of a glass seems a little...odd to me.  I chalked it up to it being opening night, again, but I was finally beginning to run out of patience when our food still hadn't arrived another 30 minutes later.  I think the kicker for me was that the waitress kept zooming past us and offering up "Just another 2 minutes!" "It'll be out soon!" "I think it's because you ordered the fillet that it's taking so long..." "Thanks for hanging in there!" "2 more minutes!" without stopping to refill drinks or ask if we needed anything else.  I actually regretted not ordering appetizers, though we might have been there another half hour.  10 minutes (seemed to be the trend of the night - I know, I know, opening night) later, I get the other beer my fiance ordered at the bar (Ska Modus Hoperandi), though the bartender was nice enough to give it to me on the house for waiting so long.  I could go on and on about how it took us close to an hour and a half to get our food, but in the end, we did get what we ordered (even after our waitress showed up with the next table's food convinced it was ours) and it wasn't half bad.  It is not food I would graciously wait an hour and a half for, but it was satisfying.  I ordered the fillet (I believe it's called Dennis' Fillet) cooked medium with prosciutto wrapped asparagus (which seemed pretty ritzy for a sports bar menu - but then it came with ranch and all was right with the world), and I received a slightly dry medium-well steak with blanched asparagus rested on some thick slices of...ham.  Don't get me wrong, the food had flavor, just not an hour and a half's worth.  Fiance got the blackened Cajun chicken sandwich with a side of pasta salad - the chicken had a nice kick, probably could've been seared a little more so the spices were more ingrained, but you won't hear any complaints about the pasta salad.  It had more flavor than most of my meal combined.    All in all, the place has some fantastic potential, the location is spot on for being in downtown Chandler, and by the time we left, there was a little bit of a wait for people to get in to eat while the bar area was jam packed.  I plan on revisiting in a month or so to see if they can get their act together and find their groove.  All of the people who served us, save for our waitress, were very courteous and helpful - even if at a snail's pace, though they didn't like hearing that we weren't 100% satisfied with our table service (hey, they asked!).  I'm sure this place will pick up some supportive regulars and turn out to be an awesome joint, just give it a little bit of time before you head in there, or at least be prepared to spend 2+ hours of your patience on the staff.

Add me to the list of satisfied - nay, delighted - customers!  I've been here twice (soon to be many, many more) with my husband and we both agree that this is the friendliest salon we've ever been to!  The staff treated us like family, we were introduced to everyone and were included in friendly banter, they offered us water, and we've never had to complain about a mani/pedi.  The massages are always spot on and they will adjust to whatever speed or pressure you want.  They have a huge selection of regular polish, but they also offer plenty of gel polishes, including customizable glitter.  They buff the nail, then do a layer of clear gel, then sprinkle whatever color glitter you want over the wet gel (then dry), finally they brush off and sand down any pieces of glitter that are sticking up and cover with two layers of clear gel.  I've never been to a place that does something like this, and it sure beats using regular sparkly polish.  Anyway, if you couldn't tell what I get done here, I really enjoy the whole place.  We've found our new place for nail maintenance!

So...on those rare occasions I don't feel like Jimmy John's, this is my first choice.  I absolutely love that they only use hormone-free local meats - it is such a fantastic step in the right direction that every other restaurant (fast food or not) should follow.  It may raise the prices slightly, but damn, food everywhere would be so tasty while the environment would get a little break.  Win-win, thus 5 stars.  Barbacoa is my favorite, and I really like that I can choose between black or pinto beans, white or brown rice, corn or flour tortilla, three different salsas, etc.  Great options that don't make me feel guilty afterwards.    I do wish they had more than just watered down macro-Mexican beers, but I understand that it fits with the whole theme.  Any local beers would be wonderful, especially if they're looking to reduce their footprint even more and continue supporting the local economies.  Plus, it would help each regions' restaurants have a little bit of their own local flair.

Yeah, I'm going to give it 5 stars, because why not?  When I don't feel like cooking or waiting in line at another "fast food" restaurant or sitting down to order an expensive meal, Jimmy John's is my go-to meal.  I'm not even going to call it a guilty pleasure, because I don't feel even a little bit guilty about this pleasure.  Seriously.    I don't think I've had to stand in this restaurant for more than 5 minutes, including ordering.  #5 with salt & vinegar chips.  Maybe 2 bags of chips.  If they sold party or family sized bags of those deliciously sour and salty chips, I would buy them in bulk - damn my figure.  Oh, and the employees are always smiling and cheerful, regardless of the day.    I do wish they were open later (they're only open til 9pm...so at least til 10pm, or 2am would make this Jimmy's my second home) and I REALLY wish that they delivered farther than the small area they deliver to.  I only live about 4 miles away, and I'm outside of their delivery zone.  I guess this is what's keeping me from being the ultimate lazy-ass though...having to physically drive to pick up my sub.  It will always be worth it.

I'm really glad I didn't attend last year (2012), but I'm also really glad I decided to go this year (2013) despite the chance that it might have totally sucked, because that was the last way I would use to describe it.  I snagged one of the Yelp discounts, so I purchased two tickets at half price, thus spending only $10 on entry.  I saw a bunch of people complaining about having to pay for parking, and a few more people saying that parking fees were included in the ticket price, so I didn't really know what to expect when I drove up to the lot.  What ended up happening was...nobody asked me for any money.  There weren't any parking fees, end of story.  As Jonathan A. said, if you paid for parking, someone ripped you off.  So my husband and I showed up around 10:45 on Sunday, and there was already a small line about 40-50 people deep, but once the gates opened, it moved extremely rapidly (I believe there were about 6 people checking everyone in).  We purchased about $30 worth of tickets at the entrance (15 tickets, $2 each), and started making our rounds.  With over 50 different trucks - some from out of state, though we stuck with all local - there was something there for everyone.    In the span of an hour and a half, we managed to visit about 10 trucks with no long waits (longest was probably 5-10 minutes, tops) or worrying about them being out of food.  All of the truck owners were fabulous and very kind and excited to talk about their offerings and overall story.  The only truck we didn't get to, but will be looking for in the future was the grilled cheese truck everyone was talking about.  By 11:30, the line was already super long, and the wait was between 30 min to an hour, so in the interest of staying local, we opted out of that one.  Trucks we tried: Spice it up!, Taste Rite, Mac Attack, Old Dixie's, Emerson Frybread, Udder Delights, Sandra Dee's Catering, Island Loco, Satay Hut, and Mustang Corral.  We enjoyed everything that we put in our mouth, though by the end of our nosh marathon - our noshathon - we were so full, we couldn't even think about putting another morsel of tasty food near our lips.  Most of the portions were perfectly bite-sized, some offered up full servings, and though my husband and I split everything between the both of us, it was still difficult to continue past the 8th truck.  What I can say for sure is this:  We will be looking out for these trucks in the valley, and will make it a point to try their regular menus from now on.  At the end of the day, it was a fantastic event, and even my husband agreed that he'd return (he's a tough customer at outdoor festivals).  So will we be back?  As long as the organizers stay on track with this year's event, count me in.

Stumbled across this place while I was waiting for a dinner reservation down the street, and it was just what the doctor ordered!  It is a cute little shop with a small freezer with a good array of gelatos and sorbets in multiple delicious flavors.  I tried the cherry and salted nut, both of which were perfectly smooth, not overly sweet (or salty, in the nut case), and refreshing - especially now that the heat has been turned back on.

I had no idea this place even existed (I promise I don't live under a rock), probably because I never shop in Scottsdale, but now that I know it's here, I will be back.  I'm an avid Pinterest user, and I recently came across one of their dresses.  Not really being a fashion participant, I usually don't get my hopes up when I like something I see online, because I'm consistently one or two seasons late.  I looked at their site and saw that the dress (and lots of other adorable things) was still listed and that there was a branch in the Scottsdale mall, so - being in desperate need of a holiday dress - I decided to check it out.    The clothes are a cross between Gap and Anthropologie, with the quality of Gap and the sticker shock of Anthropologie.  They were having a 30% off everything in the store sale, though, so no complaints.  I wasn't in there for 2 minutes before I spotted the dress, found my size (last one!) and tried it on.  To my delight, because this honestly only happens once a year for me, the dress fit like a glove, didn't feel like it would bust at the seams if I tried to bend over or sit down, and despite being covered in sequins, was very well-sewn.    Other than that, I would go back for their other clothes, but I might wait for a sale.  The sales associates were very pleasant and helpful without being annoying.  No upsells or store credit cards forced on me, either, so I'll keep an eye out for this company in the future.

Thank goodness I found this place.  I was worried I was going to have to suffer out the rest of my existence in Phoenix without decent fried chicken.  Family owned, friendly, accommodating, and fantastic food are all things I love about many different restaurants, but when they come together in one place, you can bet I'll be a regular.  I happened to be in the Ahwatukee/S Phoenix area for work at the end of the day and found myself checking Yelp for places nearby to pick up dinner.  Ezekiel's popped up, the few reviews were extremely positive, and who am I to turn down chicken if everyone likes it?    I've been here about 3 times now (with many more visits in the near future), and the food has been consistent, flavorful, hearty, and filling.  The chicken is juicy on the inside with a wonderful lightly crispy skin; I found myself licking the bones for more flavor when I finished off the meat.  The cornbread was the best side, with just the right amount of crumbly graininess, and I would highly recommend ordering extra.  I wasn't too impressed with the green beans (slightly soggy and overcooked), but I refuse to let that detract from the main dish: chicken.  You go to a fried chicken place for the fried chicken, not for vegetables.   I didn't find the wait too long, though I usually order ahead of time and go pick it up.  I appreciate food cooked to order, rather than food precooked and sitting under a heat lamp.  Yes, more, please!

So much better than the corporate Verizon stores. The reps actually want to help you and seem genuinely interested in getting you what you need.  They also offer better insurance plans and deals and are quick to respond if you need a replacement phone or accessories.  They will even mediate between you and corporate Verizon if necessary.  Haven't had a bad experience here, and for as long as I live nearby, I will continue to frequent this store for my mobile phone needs.

I love everything that ChopShop is, and when they built their 3rd location within walking distance from my house, well, it was all over for me. From the lovely outdoor seating areas in front and along the side in the breezeway, to the small bar with craft beer and wine, to the mini market that's filled with healthy snacks and drinks as you walk in, to the fresh food and juices you can order to eat in or pick up to go. The number of menu options is already fantastic, but that you can customize each of them to fit your dietary and personal needs without any hassle is even better. They may not be the quickest meal option, but ordering ahead for pick up fixes that, and just knowing that the food is freshly prepared as it's ordered is a nice comfort. I absolutely love the pressed juices, as well - especially the liver cleanse with the aloe and the power green...I instantly feel refreshed with the first few sips!  All of the salads are delicious, and getting them as a wrap is even better (and less messy if you're on the go). Breakfast is unique and flavorful, I only wish they would do over-easy/over-medium eggs (though I haven't asked for this). And the protein plates are super filling - I've been able to make them last through at least 2 meals, sometimes 3 with some snacking in between. Definitely a repeat customer!
