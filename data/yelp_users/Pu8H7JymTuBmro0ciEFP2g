Was there a week ago and was treated so poorly by the big bouncer/bartender that coming back is a stretch.  If you are not a regular, friend of the staff, or die hard Nebraska fan, he made it known that you are not welcome with his service and attitude.  Good luck to the owners future success while employing such rude service in a service industry.

Just spent over 15 minutes at a table waiting.  No waitress or waiter.  However, I was able to see up to 4 waitresses and a manager a table over eayupting and chatting while me and my friends waited.  AS We left we told the hostess why we were leaving in front of the manager and he said absolutely nothing.  Food....don't know s......drinks, don't know.......never got either.   Service..........AWFUL!!!!!!!  I will spread the word for you manager since you cannot talk!!!!!

I'm from Michigan and they definitely nailed it for me. The loose was not up to my standard, but overall was happy and excited. Can't wait to visit again to try out the other items on the menu.
