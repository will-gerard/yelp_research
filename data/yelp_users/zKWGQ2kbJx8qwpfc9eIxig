I think Luke's is great.  Best Italian beef I've had in the valley.    I moved here from Chicago about 4 years ago and although I haven't been on a mad hunt the whole time, I have had some disappointing beefs.  Luke's is by far the best I've had.    I think the best value is to buy a pound of beef and peppers from Luke's and cook it at home.  You have to buy your own bread, I like sub rolls.  The preparation is easy; just simmer in a pot on real low heat.  Then you can make em as juicy and messy, or dry as you like.  I find buying a pound will feed 3-4 and it's cheaper.  I haven't had anything else there.

Can't beat it.  Best gyro and chicken shawarma in town!  The staff is nice and the prices are great.

The Fat Burrito is great.   I went there for lunch and had a carne asada burrito.  They have two sizes; 'Beto Burrito' and the 'Fat Burrito'.  I had the smaller Beto, but thing was no wimpy burrito.  Besides being bigger than expected, it tasted great!    The service was quick and friendly.  They have a full menu and I will be back to try others.

This place is weird. They are an "Italian/Mexican" restaurant. Maybe its me, but I don't need my tacos from the same guy that makes my spaghetti.  I had the gyro sandwich. The gyro meat was average and the tzatziki sauce was bland. I also thought $7 for the sandwich was too much too. Haji baba's in Tempe is still the best gyro around.
