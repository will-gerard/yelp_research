After reading the reviews here, I drove across town to get my car washed and I have to say, I was impressed.  $17.99 for "the works" and they did an excellent job.  The cashier told me it would take half an hour and it ended up taking only 20 minutes.  My car was perfect.

Disappointing.  We decided to drive across town and try it based on the Yelp reviews and it was definitely a letdown.  Not horrible but not particularly good either.  On a Friday night at 7:30, it was less than half full. The people at the door were not particularly friendly but little did we know that it would go downhill from there.  Our waitress was one of the most surly servers I've ever had anywhere.  No greeting, no smile, no eye contact.  Just a look of pained exasperation.  We asked her a few questions and she simply ignored them.  It was not busy.  Seriously, the unfriendliness of the staff here is hard to overstate.  They just don't give a damn.  The food was all over the place.  Salsas - excellent, both red and green. Nice and spicy just like we like it.  Chips - fresh, but greasy.  Chicken enchiladas in mole sauce - quite good. Humongous portion.  Steak Tampiquena  - just ok.  Not really a traditional Tampiquena.   About four ounces (or less) of pounded round steak with no topping of any kind.  Not bad but a bit pricey for the eleven bucks or so they are asking and not up to the standard that you get at most Mexican joints around town.  Beans - Awesome, as many reviewers point out.  Some of the best refried beans I've ever had. By far the highlight of the meal.  Guacamole -  Overwhelmed by the flavor of what I can only guess to be powdered citric acid instead of fresh lime juice.  Very odd and not really nice at all.  What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't use fresh limes?    Mariachis - insistent and annoying.  And a bit much for a place like this really.  $35 with two cheap drinks and a totally unwarranted tip.

My wife and I stumbled into this place one afternoon looking for a quick bite.  We were just driving by and it was the first place we saw.  We were delighted with our experience there.  First of all, what a terrific atmosphere!  Big copper bar, candlelit, very dark and romantic.  Just lovely.  The hostess informed us they had a small plate happy hour special and that suited us just fine.  All appetizers were $5.  We ordered 4 items.     The plates themselves were huge and we could barely finish what we ordered.  They were also each very delicious and the presentation was outstanding.    Our tab for drinks, more food than we could handle and a big tip for our very nice server was $38.  Happy hour indeed!  We will definitely be going back for dinner.  It seems like the ideal location for a romantic evening.  The servers were attentive and friendly.

After really enjoying a happy hour visit a few months ago, we finally went by for dinner.  It was terrific, with a few minor hiccups.  We arrived at 7 and were shocked to find a full parking lot and a line to get in.  Nonetheless, we were seated within 15 minutes.  We really love the atmosphere here.  Dark, urban and romantic with a kind of northeastern feel.  Drinks first.  We ordered a glass of red wine, a whiskey sour and an old fashioned.  The red wine came right away.  About 5 minutes later the waitress stopped by and said "he's looking for the ingredients for the other drinks."  Hmmm.  We amused ourselves for the next 10 minutes wondering how a bar could not have the ingredients for a whiskey sour or an old fashioned.  She returned with the whiskey sour and said "He just doesn't have the ingredients for an old fashioned."  FYI, here are the ingredients for an Old Fashioned: Bourbon Soda Water Sugar Bitters A cherry and an orange peel  We found this hilarious.  I changed my order to a Manhattan and that took about a minute to arrive.  Drinks here are large and strong.  Three of shared a steak tartare and ahi tuna app.  Both were excellent and the steak tartare was perfectly executed and presented.  The appetizers here really rock.  We ordered the three dishes that the waitress recommended, a chile rellenos (from the old Robertson's menu, which is also available), a chicken schnitzel and the beef tenderloin salad.    Dinner arrived and I took a bite of my "chicken schnitzel."  Wow, that's some soft chicken I thought.  Wait a second  - that's not chicken!  The cook had apparently unilaterally upgraded me to the sea bass.  Well, no matter, it was delicious.  All in all a terrific dinner.  Service is charming and very friendly and the drinks and food are very satisfing, despite the occasional Fawlty Towers moments.

I was driving by looking for a place for lunch and I stopped in, hoping for some deli food.   I was quite surprised to see that it's actually an old-school cafeteria. I didn't know that these places existed anymore and I was ready to be charmed.  Alas, that was not to be.  Although I came inside in the mood for pastrami, watching the staff throw together - and I mean that quite literally, I've never seen anybody, anywhere make a sandwich as quickly or carelessly - I lost my nerve and ordered the meat loaf special, thinking that was probably a better way to go in a place like this.  Unfortunately the meat loaf was dreadful as were the mashed potatoes.  Absolutely devoid of any flavor and covered in a gloppy gravy.  Seriously awful.  I see that one reviewer described it as hospital food.  That's being charitable because some hospitals actually have edible food.  It's more like what I imagine prison food to be like.   It's also not particularly cheap.  My prison plate was $9.73 with the tax.  Not recommended.

It's OK.    I hate to always be bitching about Mexican food in the Valley, but what can you do?  It's a disgrace.  The fact that this place appears to be some kind of Holy Grail of Mexican food here in Phoenix just seems to emphasize that point.  Let's deal with the food first.  This isn't really Mexican food. It's Tex-Mex food.  That means you've got your choice of tacos, burritos, tostadas, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc.    We tried the "Oaxaca" burro (massive air quotes around the "Oaxaca" part of the name), which was just fine, but very, very small.  I mean seriously, i'ts beans, cheese, potatoes and a bit of chorizo - we're not talking ahi tuna here.  Why not give a normal sized portion?  We tried the menudo which was delicious but again, a miniscule portion. And they can't even be bothered to give you a plastic bowl, so you have to eat it out of the styrofoam to go container.  I mean, for F's sake, they give me a plastic bowl at my favorite taco truck.    Still hungry, we ordered a combination plate, which was the same sort of tex-mex crap that you can get pretty much anywhere in town.  Not so great.  It was all fine for what it is (I guess) but nothing that I would particularly go out of my way for, with the exception of the homemade flour tortillas, which were awesome.  I even bought some to go.  And that's about it for the food.  Now as to the restaurant itself, it's actually pretty disgusting, to the point where one has to conclude that they are just showing contempt for the customers.  The place is filthy.  The bathrooms, in particular, are vile. As Tony Bourdain says, "I may not be able to look in the kitchen but I can check out the bathroom and that let's me know how much they care about the restaurant." Uh, exactly!   And the answer in Carolina's would seem to be, "not very much."  The surly and uninterested staff add to that special ambiance.   We eat in lots of small ethnic restaurants and just because a place is "in the hood" doesn't mean it has to be gross.  Our favorite Salvadorean restaurant is in the hood but it's also hospital clean, which makes me pretty confident that the kitchen is also clean.   Finally, the neighborhood.  LOL.  To describe this street as "in the hood" is an insult to "hoods" everywhere.  This street is one of the most blighted streets I've ever been on, anywhere.  I'm actually thinking of going back there today to do some documentary photos to send to my friends in Cambodia whose visions of America are mostly derived from CSI Miami.  Seriously, it's appalling.  The main thing I was thinking about driving away from there is that the Phoenix city government needs some kind of federal intervention.  So would I eat there again?  Yeah, probably, if I was in the neighborhood.  Would I go out of my way to drive there?  No way.

I'm afraid this is one of those "I wanted to love it, but..." reviews.   We had an assortment of tacos and burritos.  They were fine but absolutely nothing special whatsoever.  Yes, they were authentic Mexican tacos (i.e., not Taco Bell) but is that really supposed to be something special in Arizona for cryin' out loud?   It's not like we're in Canada here, people.  I saw the piece on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives where they made a big deal about their variety of salsas and how people came from miles around to buy them.  Seriously?  They had exactly two salsas.  Again, they were fine, but nothing special and nothing at all like what we saw on TV.  We ordered chips and salsa and got a small little french fry tray of chips with no salsa.  I asked the girl at the counter for salsa and she pointed to the same two bottles. Ah, ok.  Woo hoo.  I would happily stop there if I was in the neighborhood but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.

A very, very nice Pakistani buffet.  Every single thing we had was delicious and seemed very fresh.  The service was perfunctory (it's a buffet) but friendly.  And quite a bargain at $11.50 per person.  Highly recommended.

We were on our way to China Magic Noodle and drove by this place so we decided to check it out.  Big mistake.  Not sure what restaurant the other Yelpers ate in but it sounds like a different place.  Our experience: bad neighborhood, creepy clientele, unfriendly owner, AC that was either malfunctioning or turned off, absolutely no atmosphere of any kind and really, really sub-par food.  We had a bowl of curry ramen that the owner couldn't even bother to mix the curry into.  No meat or vegetables at all.  Just ramen and a lump of curry paste.  And then a curry katsu don that was quite possibly the worst I've ever had  There was no greeting, no smile and no attempt to communicate. My wife's awful ramen came out a good 5 minutes before my katsu.  When my food finally did come out, the owner simply dumped the tray on the table (they don't bother taking it off the cafeteria tray), spilling miso soup all over my napkin.  No "Sorry" or offer to replace the napkin (no napkins on the table despite the fast food type setting).  Just really surly, unfriendly service. (Perhaps he'd have a better attitude if he turned the air on - it was 108 when we were there.) One of the other customers asked for wasabi and the owner said - I'm not kidding - "It's not free you know!"   Really just a very sad attempt at food that isn't really that complicated in the first place and the owner's extremely bad attitude made the whole experience kind of insulting.  The owner appears openly contemptuous of both the food and the customers and who needs that?  Even it if were good, which it emphatically was not.  I'd rather eat anything than this crap.  There are a half-dozen other restaurants within a mile of here that are terrific.  Avoid this place.

Like the other poster, we found this place via a Yelp "Nearby" search and were very pleasantly surprised.    This particular branch of this restaurant is tucked into the corner of a mostly deserted shopping center in a rundown part of Mesa and doesn't look like much from outside.    Inside is a different story.  The restaurant is fairly humble but immaculately clean and bright with a pleasant enough ambiance and the service was friendly and quick.    We had  a ceviche salad ($12.95) and a pupusa combination plate ($7.95).  Both were quite delicious and portions were huge.  If you aren't familiar with Salvadorean food, I'd recommend you start with the pupusa with loroco (an edible flower), which is the classic pupusa and extremely delicious.

No-nonsense cheap Mexican (Tex-Mex) food.  It's a tiny neighborhood joint but the food is pretty reliable for what it is.  The tacos and burritos are better than the tortas, which are undistinguished.    Definitely the best $5 Mexican food in this part of town, which is probably why it's almost always busy.

Very nice little Japanese restaurant.  We've been once for lunch and once for dinner.  I love the fact that they cut a thick slab of fish for the sushi and sashimi here, much more so than other Japanese places I've been in Arizona.  This is true Japanese style and how sushi is supposed to be served.    We recently visited another "high-end" Japanese restaurant in Scottsdale which served the smallest pieces of fish I've ever seen in a restaurant at exorbitant prices. Ridiculous.  Well, that's not what is going on here.   I don't know how or why Japanese restaurants have evolved in the USA into serving super-expensive micro-portions but that ain't how it is in Japan.  Sushi is supposed to be quick and easy comfort food.  A sushi joint in Japan is filled with normal working people chowing down on massive portions of fish, served quickly and without ostentation, not boob-jobbed bulemics eating over-priced, razor thin slices of fish.  Even today, in Tokyo you can get 10 orders of nigiri for less than $20.  Sakana fits nicely into that unpretentious tradition.  At Sakana, the quality of the fish is high.  The menu is not very broad and they don't have a huge selection but what they do have is fresh and excellent.  It is also an excellent value, particularly at lunch where $9.95 buys you a very ample sushi combination.  Service is quick and friendly.  Recommended.

Traditional 70's style Italian-American food in a strip mall mainly notable because you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee.  Don't believe the hype - this place is nothing special.  Contrary to the many reviews here that comment on how cheap it is, I found it a bit expensive for what you're getting, which is not exactly nuova cucina.  $15.95 for two small (non-homemade) cannelloni a la carte is not a bargain in my book.  Their linguine with white clam sauce is some canned clams tossed with a copious amount of oil (1/2 a cup perhaps) and some boxed pasta for $12.95.  The $9.95 "insalata Romana" is a plate of tired iceberg lettuce, a tomato wedge or two, and a few shreds of bland cheese swimming in a very tart vinaigrette.     This is the kind of food that used to represent Italian food in America before the food revolution of the 80's.  The kind of place you'd find, not in New York or Chicago, but in Terre Haute or Tampa at a time when "eye-talian" food was still considered a bit exotic.  The many reviews stating that this is "real homemade Italian food" are a bit puzzling since it's neither homemade nor Italian.  This is very old-fashioned pre-foodie Italian-American food and while it's OK for what it is, it certainly isn't "real Italian" food by any stretch of the imagination nor is it, for the most part, homemade.    N.B. No, a visit to this restaurant is not "just like going to Italy."  For that matter, it's not just like going to Little Italy.  I realize Phoenix is not exactly a mecca for italian food, but WTF people!      The mostly 60+ crowd seems to love it.  I can only guess that they are overwhelmed by nostalgia for a simpler time, because while it may not be Kierland pretentious nor a crappy chain restaurant, the food just isn't very good.  Seriously.   The servers have a strange attitude that I guess is supposed to be "east-coast" or something (rushed, cocky, borderline rude) but seems a bit out of place in what is basically a mom and pop strip mall joint serving canned food with plastic red checked tablecloths and thin paper napkins.  In any case, they are very selective with their attention and you can wait quite a while to get something.  Also, as several other reviewers have pointed out, they give you a non-itemized bill with just the total due written on it which seems to include an extra 10% or so with no explanation offered.   This seems quite bizarre to me but apparently no one objects.  At this restaurant, $15.95 + $12.95 + $9.95 somehow add up to $45.65.  The non-itemized bill is a weird affectation at best - why would you do that, especially in a cheap joint like this?  But to do that and then mis-calculate?  There's a word for that in Italian - it's imbrogliare.   $54 for two with tip for a simple shared salad and two pasta dishes with no meat and no drinks.

A nice neighborhood place but kind of over-promises and under-delivers in my opinion.  We had breakfast.  It was pretty good but the portions are a bit small for the relatively high tariff.  Our breakfasts were ten dollars each.  You get one piece of toast.  I find this a bit curious.  I mean the standard order of toast anywhere else in America is two pieces.  Here you get one piece.  Why would you do that?  Bread is cheap.  Breakfast for two with coffee was nearly $30 with tip.  Even though we were sitting literally next to the kitchen window our food arrived cold.  Coffee was good and strong.  Very friendly staff.  Worth stopping by if you're in the neighborhood but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way.

Very cute place. The predominantly female clientele seemed quite happy.  I was not terribly impressed.    I had the $10 chicken club which was a small sandwich on an enormous plate with a teensy weensy fruit cup.  The sandwich was good enough although a bit heavy on the fat but it really wasn't enough food and it looked very forlorn sitting there on the plate with the tiny plastic ramekin with a few grapes and slices of cantaloupe.  My friend had an enormous salad.  My sandwich was gone in about 3 minutes and the server promptly took my plate away leaving me to watch my friend eat for the next 15 minutes and wishing I'd ordered something else.  The ambiance was quite pleasant and the service was okay, but I was underwhelmed by the food.  Perhaps a nice place to have a drink or cup of coffee though.

I am not impressed.  It's positively scandalous that in a city that is 41% Latino, most of whom are Mexican-American, that there is so much crappy Mexican food. I really don't get it.   Anyway, there really isn't much to say about this place.  It's a shithole, which I wouldn't mind if the food is great, but that is not the case here.  They are serving up extremely mediocre Mexican food.    I had the three taco plate with tacos de cabeza.  The tacos were okay.  The rest of the stuff on the plate was crap.  A tiny portion - maybe an eighth of a cup each of rice and beans, accompanied by a really odd and nasty avocado sauce and a very sad little salad with roughly three tablespoons of mayo.  The price for the taco plate and a large horchata was $9.76.  While not expensive, that's really not that cheap for a place like this, if you know what I mean.  This is by no means the worst Mexican food I've ever had but reading these reviews you would get the impression that it's something special.  It's not.  You'd do better at any taco truck in Tucson or Southern California.

We finally stopped in for Happy Hour and were impressed.    We ordered the Big Ass Burger and the Green Chile Pork stew based on recommendations here and both were excellent.  Portions are huge - we ended up taking half of it home.  Excellent drinks and very friendly professional service.  We also liked the warm and inviting atmosphere in the bar.  Great value too - we were out the door for thirty bucks.

After trying many other local dry cleaners, I found this place on Yelp and love it.  First of all, they do a good job; secondly, the prices are great and thirdly, they're really nice here.     I am extremely picky about my clothes and I can't see any difference between Seville and places charging 7 times as much.

Was in the neighborhood and Yelp'd "Nearby" on my phone, so we ended up here.  Like several other reviewers, we are baffled by the many five star reviews of this place.  When we walked in, the first thing that struck us was the extremely unfriendly greeting.  The restaurant was nearly deserted at 8:30 and we didn't feel very welcome.  The second thing that struck us was, despite its claims to be a "New Mexican" restaurant, it's really more of a generic type menu.  Speaking of the menus, they are printed on newsprint and were filthy.  The restaurant in general was not very clean.  All in all, mediocre and over-priced.   We tried the Habenero burger and the machaca chimichanga.  Both just average and comparable to your typical chain restaurant.  The black beans were inedible and the rice was microwaved and obviously quite old.    We asked for some chips while we were waiting and we were told that they were $3.00.  Uhm, ok.  Surprisingly, they turned out to be the best part of the meal.  Our server was pleasant enough but the overall vibe was unfriendly despite the fact that there were only 3 or 4 tables in the immense dark cavern that is this restaurant.  I guess the next time we're in the mood for actual New Mexican food, we'll have to drive over to Rokerij and hit up the Robertson's menu there.  Vastly superior to this joint in every way.  $40 with tip and one beer. I can't imagine ever returning here.

I have to say I love this place.  The fact that it's around the corner from my house doesn't hurt but I'm a bit baffled by the haters here.  Expensive?  Are you kidding?  It's unpretentious, friendly and they have a great selection of wines by the glass - and a 10 ounce pour to boot.  The servers are super friendly and there's never any pressure to order anything.  More of a casual European feel.  I can't comment on the food - we have never eaten anything here.  But if you're looking for a nice friendly little bar where you can have a giant glass of excellent wine for ten bucks, you will be very happy here.

We've been meaning to go here for a while and finally stopped in for dinner.  We had a very nice experience: great food, very good service and quite reasonable prices.    For some reason, I had been under the impression that this was an expensive restaurant and it's not at all.  Portions are ginormous.  We shared a Tahdig and a single entree of lamb shank (which included 2 enormous lamb shanks for $20) and we took half of our food home, all for less than 50 bucks with a tip.  Highly recommended.

These guys are great.  I took my car to another MB shop which was professional enough but which was going to charge me more than the dealer and it was going to take two days.  I talked to Mike and they fixed me up in half a day at a significant savings. Very nice people and a pleasure to deal with also.  Highly recommended.

Odd Happy Hour. Terrible food.  The only time in my life I've ever seen a group order chicken wings and not finish them.  I mean, that's saying something isn't it?    Two stars because they have Guinness on tap and it's a convenient location so I always seem to end up there when I am in Tempe, even though it's not very good.  Note to self: beer only next time.

Awesome!  Our new "go" to place for middle eastern food.  Much, much better than Baiz Market.  Also, extremely cheap.  We had the koubeh and kibbedeh plates, along with sides of foul, falafel, a yogurt soda and two orders of baklava to go for the amazingly small sum of $27.  How are you going to beat that ?   Due to the unexpectedly huge portion sizes, we ended up taking most of it home.  Everything was delicious and the service was very fast even though it was packed.    Head and shoulders above every other middle eastern place I've eaten at in town.  Highly recommended.

Happy Hour Review  Terrific happy hour with a nice selection of half-price wines by the glass and half-price appetizers.  Cafe Boa is a quiet oasis on Mill Ave.  We really liked the ambiance.  The restaurant has high ceilings and a kind of European/Viennese atmosphere that is charming and comfortable.   We had the mussels and a pasta dish, both of which were excellent and quite a bargain at about 7 bucks each.  Some interesting eastern European wines and a super-friendly staff.    We'll be back!

Happy Hour Review.  We stopped by to try the much ballyhooed Happy Hour and were were pretty damn underwhelmed.    First of all, I guess I'm failing to see what's so happy about a $6.00 spicy tuna roll and $8.00 drink.  Secondly, like other non-japanese sushi joints in this town (cough, cough Ra Sushi), this is sushi for people who don't really like sushi.  Thirdly, seriously attitudinous staff, but one look at the uber-douchy clientele explains that.  Pass.

Lee's is a terrific and authentic Vietnamese Banh Mi (sandwich) shop located across the street from Lee Lee Market at the corner of Warner and Dobson.  They've got a bunch of stuff on the menu but I always order the same thing, the #11 Special which runs a whopping $3.15.  You get a very fresh foot long baguette with a few slices of processed pork and lots of fresh vegies and cilantro.  It's quick, delicious and refreshing.  It's a cleaned up version of pretty much any Hanoi Banh Mi joint, which is to say, it's just fine.

We'd noticed all the slams on this place and had crossed it off our list, but some friends called us at 11:30 the other night and asked us to meet them there, so we did.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Even though we got there at 11:50, they still served us and the service was - contrary to many of the reviews here - extremely friendly and gracious.  Our food arrived rapidly and the waiter came back one more time after midnight to see if we wanted anything else before they shut down the kitchen.  We didn't eat much because of the hour but what we had was just fine.  We'll try it again some time when we're in the mood for a full meal.

The single best place to have lunch if you're in the Paradise Valley Mall area.    This family-run eatery serves up traditional Mediterranean classics  but they make each one their own.  The ground beef kabob is nothing short of spectacular.  In many places, that dish is an afterthought but not here.  Their house rice is an aromatic yellow rice with almonds and raisins and absolutely delicious.  It's also a proper restaurant - not your typical gyro lunch counter vibe.  Lunch for two runs $17.00 and we usually take food home.  Everyone I've brought here loves it.  Highly recommended!

What a great Happy Hour!  We stopped in at 5 on a Friday and it was jammed.  The hostesses were very gracious and gave us a nice table since the bar was jammed. The crowd was loud, stylish and very friendly.  We ordered four appetizers, all of which were excellent.  The two most noteworthy were the crab cake which was both huge and just incredibly delicious and an unbelievable steal at $6.00 and the chopped salad that was so big the waiter had to split it onto two plates.  Again, about $6.00. We had some ahi sashimi thing that was very nice and a shrimp cocktail that was the least impressive of the lot.    The drinks were excellent and the service was outstanding : professional, quick and very friendly.  Very nice selection of wines by the glass too.  We rolled out of there stuffed and very satisfied with the entire experience.  Can't wait to go back for dinner.  Highly recommended!

Reheated, insipid food and perfunctory service in a kitschy atmosphere.  We drove 32 miles from our house to Haus Murphy's because we were in the mood for German.  It was the middle of a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't very busy.  We ordered a couple of beers and the Bauernplatte combination for 2.  This includes several kinds of sausage, a pork cutlet, a schnitzel, a kind of hamburger in gravy, red cabbage, sauerkraut, spatzle and fried potatoes.    It look great! Sadly, it all appeared to have been pre-cooked and then microwaved.    Let me repeat that -  a precooked and microwave schnitzel!  The spaetzle in particular was a soggy, water-logged travesty.  $35 for this by the way.  So with two beers and tip, that was $60.00 for lunch. For microwaved food.  It's quite sad that they don't really care about the quality of food here.  This type of Bavarian food is fairly easy to prepare so it's hard to understand why they would have so much contempt for the customers or the lovely cuisine of Germany.  Any restaurant that would serve you reheated food like this really doesn't care about you or about the food they are serving.  I wish I had noticed the 50 filtered reviews before eating here.

We really like this place.  Great food, great drinks, friendly staff and a very friendly crowd.  Just sleazy enough to be fun.  The food is much better than it ought to be for what is basically a really popular bar.  Tandoori chicken pizza, great salads, etc.  Oh yeah and Hoegaarden on tap!  And a very nice smoking patio if you're so inclined.

The good news is that they have Negra Modelo at 2 for $2.50 at Happy Hour, which has to be some kind of Scottsdale record.  The bad news is that it's a Mexican restaurant that seems to want to be a titty bar when it grows up.   The other reviewers aren't kidding when they say that every girl working here has implants.  Big humongous ones.  Not that there's anything wrong with that but it did confuse me on the concept somewhat. Friendly servers though.  The food - at least what I had - was barely edible.  Stick to the $1.25 beers.

This is a review of the bar only.  We stopped by for a cocktail on a Saturday night.  Drinks are outrageously expensive - $15 for a mojito? Give me a freakin' break!    However, the high tariff is somewhat mitigated by the fact that a) they know how to make a drink here; b)  it's a truly beautiful bar; and c) it's like a glass-bottom boat tour of the mating rituals of North Scottsdale.   I mean, really.  You kind of have to see it to believe it.  Mrs. Wanderer and I sat in awe observing the scene unfolding in front of us.  I would try to describe it in more detail but if I started, I'd hit the Yelp character limit before I could do it justice.  Suffice it to say, it's a nonpareil anthropological experience.

Over-priced corporate chain "high end" restaurant.  No reason to eat here unless you happen to work in the building next door.  The steaks are about the same price as Mastros/Ruth's Chris/Morton's but not remotely in the same league. Not prime, not aged, absolutely mediocre.  Appetizers and sides were all of the same middling quality.  Lots of better places to eat downtown and for a lot less money.

I'll keep this short and sweet.  Eight bucks for a chicken pita with lots of chicken and absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  I mean, no flavor at all.  The place is mysteriously crowded.  I honestly can't imagine why.  This is McDonalds for people who don't want to feel like they are walking into a McDonalds. Like McDonalds, it's also a national chain, so I'm not sure why people are saying it's "locally owned," or at least any more locally owned than your local McDonalds.  http://www.zoeskitchen.com/menu.asp

Terrific dim sum!    It's your standard Monterey Park style Cantonese seafood joint and I mean that as the highest compliment. It's also very busy and thus, very fresh.  At peak dim sum times, it's usually full and the crowd is 95% Chinese.  Everything is fresh and authentic and also extremely cheap.  Not much more to say about - it's like any dim sum place in Southern California or Hong Kong.  The last time we were there, one of the chefs (who was Chinese and could only speak Cantonese, despite what the other reviewer seems to be implying) came by our table with a hot hotel tray full of sweet pastries just out of the oven.  They were superb.    Highly recommended if you're in the area (next to the Chandler Lee Lee market).  If you're looking for Kung Pao chicken, this is not the place for you.  Hard for a couple to spend more than $25 here.

We eat here at least twice a month.  There are two things that set this place apart from most other dim sum restaurants in America, never mind just in Phoenix.  1. A chef who loves to bake.  The head chef, Sam, is constantly baking up really delicious specials.  These are typically sweets/desserts and they are awesome.  He will come out to the tables on a busy weekend with a hot baking sheet full of pastries.  If he offers, by all means, take some!  2. Extremely accommodating service.  We take all of of friends there and that includes some very picky eaters, as well as kids.  I've never seen any restaurant go to such lengths to make sure everybody is happy, including making all kinds of off-menu items to satisfy the pickiest eaters.  Bottom line, it rocks!

Awesome!  Excellent authentic Chinese food, quick and friendly service and just about as cheap as it is possible for a restaurant to be.  We ate there on a Friday night.  It was busy but we got menus within 30 seconds and our food arrived less than 5 minutes after we ordered it.  We had the spicy chicken wings (really salt and pepper chicken wings) which were fantastic and the the spicy dumplings to start.  Excellent.  For mains, we had a spicy shrimp dish and the eggplant spareribs, both delicious.  Our waiter checked back in with us four or five times to  refill our water, ask us if we wanted anything else, etc.  The staff is very friendly here.  As others have pointed out here, it's a Hong Kong style diner, meaning a kind of cheap, no-frills, "let's grab some food on the way home" kind of place with Cantonese comfort food (joke, chow fun, rice bowls) and Chinese interpretations of western dishes.  If this place were near my office, I'd have lunch here everyday.  Alas, it is not.    It's also just crazy cheap.  Appetizers run $2.21 and the entrees all top out at $7.72 with a generous selection of one-dish meals at a flat five bucks.  Hard to beat that.

Perfectly acceptable Korean food.    We've been pretty disappointed with most of the Korean food around town, which has ranged from mediocre and expensive (Hodori) to awful and expensive (Red Kimchi/Korean Restaurant) to just generally mediocre (Takematsu).  Chodang was reasonably priced and not bad at all.  Make no mistake - this ain't LA's Koreatown - but it's the only place we've found that's at all acceptable.  We had six panchan to start which were decent if not inspired then a pretty big portion of galbi, a nice seafood soon dobu and a seafood pajeon.  The galbi was quite nice, the soon dobu was perfect and the pajeon was good, but a bit odd, more like a 2 inch thick frittata than a traditional pajeon.  About $50 for a big meal for three people. Service was friendly and quick.

Not bad but not particularly great either.  I continue to be disappointed by the middle eastern food in this town.  I stopped in at lunch on a weekday and waited in a very long line.  The place was hopping.  I ordered a $7.99 combination plate which featured hummus, baba ganoush, shawarma, falafal and tabouli.    Alas, it was merely adequate.  First of all, the portions were miniscule, even for lunch.  The hummus and baba were served in little plastic ramekins (i.e., ketchup cups).  This is a bit ridiculous in and of itself - I mean hummus is not exactly a high food cost item but more to the point, neither was particularly tasty.  The baba ganoush was watery and lacking in flavor and the hummus was nothing special with no detectable garlic.  The shawarma was exactly two thin strips of meat.  Four small falafel balls. And of course one small piece of pita bread.    I asked for more bread and they brought another piece, but I'm always baffled by American middle eastern restaurants that serve you one piece of pita bread.  This cuisine traditionally calls for copious amounts of bread and one piece of bread just doesn't cut it.  So summing up, bland food and small portions do not a memorable lunch make.

These guys are great!  This is the go to place if you have knives that need sharpening or reconditioning and they do it at a ridiculously low price.  And they can usually do it on the spot while you wait too.  Recommended.

Awesome!  The best $20 you can spend in Vegas (for dinner for 2).  We found this place on Yelp and dropped by around 7 o'clock on a Thursday.  It was packed and we grabbed the last available table.  We surveyed the offerings on the cold buffet (3 for $4.50) and chose the pig ears, the beef tongue and chicken feet.  A very generous portion and all were delicious.   For our mains, we had the "Boiled Beef and Fish in Szechuan Sauce," which is actually the classic Szechuan hot pot and an order of Dan Dan Mien (spicy noodles with ground meat).  We ordered both with maximum heat and they were both pretty spicy and absolutely delicious.   Everyone in the restaurant was speaking Mandarin and all of the staff and 99% of the customers were obviously Chinese from the PRC.  This is no Taiwanese or Hong Kongese upscale dining experience.  It's an authentic PRC chow hall.  It was extremely loud and lively and pretty much exactly like being in this class of restaurant in China.  Szechuan is my favorite province in China and although the food wasn't  quite up to what you'd get in Szechuan it was a pretty damn good facsimile.  We didn't bring our own beer but half the other tables did and I'd advise you to do the same.

Had lunch there today and was pretty danged impressed with my torta.  I had the Norteno, which was steak, cheese, tomato, avocado and a fried egg.  It was really tasty.   And quite a bargain at $6.99 since I could barely finish it.  Service was quick, friendly and excellent, even though it was the lunch rush and they were at capacity.  Pleasant atmosphere also.

Stopped in for Happy Hour after reading some positive reviews.  We were really not impressed with the food.   We ordered what the server recommended and it tasted like microwaved frozen food, reminding me of the sort of thing you might get  at a low-budget corporate event.  Excellent service and very pretty space but frankly, the worst food I've eaten at Fashion Square.  I've eaten at their other locations in Vegas and Beverly Hills and I don't remember them being this mediocre, so I'm not sure what the problem is.  It just doesn't make sense to eat here when you've got a half dozen much better options within walking distance.

Really wanted to love it.  And really didn't!  I was excited to see what was described as an "izakaya" style lounge - perhaps my favorite way to enjoy Japanese food -  but let me tell you, this ain't no izakaya.  An izakaya, by definition, has a certain rustic and friendly feel, catering to drinkers with simple and earthy dishes.  This place is the absolute antithesis of that aesthetic.  We dropped by for Happy Hour, hoping for an izakaya type experience.  We had four items from the food menu.  They were OK.  The "izakaya butterfish"  was three tiny, razor-thin slices of fish - literally smaller and thinner than a slice of gari - for five bucks.  Even at five bucks, it was a rip-off.  Silly, actually.  Perhaps half an ounce of fish if not less.  And this is the "happy hour" menu?  The little cheeseburgers were, well, little cheeseburgers.  Modern Steak does a much nicer version with less pretension. The skewered vegies were ok  Basically, their "izakaya" menu had a complete absence of actual izakaya dishes.  Sigh.  Just a more pretentious (and much more expensive) version of RA Sushi for people who don't really want to try anything different.  Hence, cheeseburgers.  Does everything in America always have to come down to cheeseburgers? It's sad.  The design is attractive and very modern but again, not by any stretch of the imagination what most people would identify as an "izakaya."  The concept is not supposed to be to serve little tiny over-priced dishes in an antiseptic atmosphere.  (This is so NOT how Japanese food is supposed to be!)  Neither the staff nor the customers were particularly friendly.  My wife was the only Asian person visible in the restaurant. I think most Japanese people would be simply bewildered by this restaurant's food, style and atmosphere.  It also had that kind of creepy vibe unique to Scottsdale that I can only describe as "hostile pick up bar," a kind of weird combination of sexual energy and animosity.  Ick. (And what's up with that by the way?)  Based on our experience at the bar, I can't really imagine a circumstance where we'd go back.  Nothing that we ate - or saw - was particularly interesting and the attitudinous staff and creepy customers put us off.

Had dinner there last week with my an old friend I hadn't seen in years and we had a great evening on the patio, hanging out for hours and drinking wine.  The food menu is extremely limited, featuring mostly salads and sandwiches with very little meat or fish on offer.  Kind of a veggie grazing thing.  The wine list is pretty good and fairly priced, mostly in the $30-40 range as I recall.  No music when we were there and the service was fine.  We lingered for almost four hours with our single bottle of wine and we never felt rushed or uncomfortable.  The food was fine, if not particularly memorable but the ambiance was perfect.  A great place to go and hang with some friends and drink wine, assuming you're not up for a big meal.    We had to wait for a few minutes inside until there was room on the patio and I think I would have been much less happy had we had to stay inside.  Outside is definitely the way to go.  Two salads and a bottle of wine were about $45.

Outstanding.  City Hall is discreetly tucked away in a non-descript office building but once you walk in, you are in a classic and very attractive East Coast style steakhouse.  You can choose to sit in the very lively bar area or in the more formal dining room.  We opted for the bar.  Service is fast and attentive by white-jacketed waiters.  An excellent pricey wine list, as you would expect.  We ordered the ahi tuna tartare as a starter.  It came in a three layer tower: puffed rice, avocado and the tuna on top.  Delicious.  My wife had the pepper steak and I ordered the bone-in ribeye, rare.  The food came out very quickly and the steaks were exactly how we wanted them.  The meat was superb.  When you put aside the booming Sinatra, the New York affectations, the white-jacketed waiters and the over-sized portions, what you're left with is the meat, which is the reason you came here in the first place.  This was perfectly aged and cooked meat.   We ordered a potatoes au gratin on the side and I have to agree with the other reviewer here - there was really a bit too much cheese.  I mean, I'm all for excess - especially in a steakhouse - but enough with the cheese already guys.  A very minor quibble, however.  We were unable to eat more than half the meal and the leftovers were professionally packaged up to take home in a giant over-sized Maestro's bag.  Pretty much everyone leaves here with one of these.  All in all, a perfect dinner on every score.  Get your paper out though because all this bombast and cholesterol doesn't come cheap.    Recommended when you're in the mood for this sort of thing.

I stopped in the other day and was really impressed.  Terrific gyro and Greek salad for $7.95 for lunch.  Huge portions, great taste.  These places are on every corner in Chicago or New York but not so common here.  It's a sort of fast food ambiance but the food is right on.   Highly recommended.

Yeah, it's a chain and while not haute cuisine, we had a very good meal there.  We were there on a busy Saturday night and we had great, friendly and quick service and our food was quite good.    Not only is it a good value for the neighborhood, I thought it was downright cheap for what you get.  (It's probably roughly comparable to The Hillstone Group's Houston's or Bandera in terms of quality and service at about half the price.)    Great salads too.  I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for it, but it's a very reasonable choice if you happen to be at Fashion Square.  Dinner for 2 with drinks, about fifty bucks.

Excellent.    I love having breakfast out and this place is exactly what a breakfast place should be as far as I'm concerned.  Quick, friendly and no-nonsense service.  We both had omelets and they were big, hot and delicious.  Toast was perfect, as were the hash browns.  Coffee was hot and frequently refilled.  Breakfast for 2 is about 20 bucks.  We'll be back.

Honestly, the best experience I've ever had in a computer store.  My Toshiba laptop screen had stopped working and I wasn't sure if it was an inverter or the screen itself.  They ended up replacing the screen for a very reasonable price after explaining in very specific detail just what my options were and what the costs would be.  As other reviewers have pointed out, there was no diagnostic charge and no minimum.   The store itself is beautifully designed.  Nelson, the person who helped me was extremely courteous and thorough and they kept in constant communication with me through each step of the process.  I was very pleased with every aspect of this experience.  Highly recommended.

The Lee Lee Market shopping center in Chandler is really one stop shopping for great food.  We were already big fans of Phoenix Palace for dim sum and China Magic Noodle for noodles, so we thought we'd try Pho Van.  We both ordered the special Pho and it was quite good. Nice rich broth with all the requisite ingredients.  Lots of fresh herbs and vegies served alongside.  We got a pork spring roll and that was nice as well.  Basically, exactly what it should be and about $25 for three dishes with tip.  Service was fine.

Underwhelming and over-priced.    Mrs. Wanderer became a fan of churrasco, Brazilian barbecue after eating at the outstanding Via Brasil in Vegas last year so we popped in Fogo de Chao to see how they compared.  Answer: not favorably.  The best thing about this place is the physical appearance of the restaurant but it's all downhill from there. Two star food, one star service and a four star price.    The salad bar was just okay but really nothing to get excited about. We were much more interested in the meat courses than messing around so after a perfunctory pass at the antipasti we had the waiter clear our plates and waited for the meat to begin.  And waited. And waited some more.  Waiter after waiter walked by us, huge spear of meat in hand, head down, studiously ignoring us.  We finally managed to flag one down by literally, yelling.  We didn't know what else to do since we'd been waiting at least ten minutes for somebody to serve us and we were hungry.  We finally got some meat and it was fine but then the same thing happened on the next course.  For the next hour we played this game where the waiters would walk by us doing their best to avoid eye contact and we'd try to intercept them.  It's very hard to avoid concluding that they are really not that keen on giving you meat here which kind of negates the point of being a churrascaria.   The three sides were all mediocre and unmemorable: soggy microwaved bananas, mashed potatos and fried polenta wedges.    For this kind of money, I'd much rather eat at Ruth's Chris or Morton's.

I'm not quite as enamored of this joint as everybody else here seems to be but it's fine for what it is, which is a normal friendly bar.  I'd go ahead and give it five stars if they had a waitress or draft beer, but they don't have either which means I have to drink canned Guinness and get it myself.  It's cheap - at least compared to the $14 martinis at AZ88 - but not Coach House cheap, if you know what I mean.  Still, a pretty obvious choice if you're in the neighborhood.

My Pakistani colleague took me here for lunch and it was just terrific.  They have both an a la carte menu and a lunchtime buffet.    The buffet has basmati rice, a kind of chicken korma kind of thing, chana dal, fried potatoes and it came with a hubcap-sized piece of fresh naan, hand delivered to the table.  All you can eat for $5.99.    The atmosphere is basic - much like Baiz Market, it's a market that happens to have a small food area, not a proper restaurant per se.  I love these kind of places but it's not exactly a date restaurant in case that's what you're looking for.   What's not to like?  Cheap, delicious, quick and friendly.  Update: Went back for a casual dinner and ordered from the a la carte menu.  It took about 25 minutes which had us wondering but when the food was served we realized why - every single thing had been made to order, down to the rice.  It's like going to your Pakistani grandma's house for dinner.  Super-fresh, delicious and very friendly service.  Highly recommended for foodies who want authentic Indian/Pakistani food.

The only place to go for soul food in Scottsdale.  Chicken and waffles of course, but lots of other stuff too.  I like the "Backwoods," livers and gizzards in a pan gravy over rice.  When you're in the mood for this sort of thing, this is the only place to go.

Wretched.  We were excited to find a Korean restaurant relatively close to our house but this was literally the worst Korean food I've ever had.  We ordered Galbi and Samgyeopsal.  The galbi was in a lousy marinade with no flavor.  The pork dish was served as a single solid frozen block of pork loin.  Mmmm.  The meat was mediocre at best but the whole point of Korean BBQ are the "banchan" - the side dishes.  The BBQ was served with some lettuce and nothing else.  I asked for pajori and he said he didn't know what I was talking about.     The banchan were pathetic, literally.  Five small dishes of extremely mediocre  crap.  Even the rice was bad, obviously old and reheated.  We ordered buricha to drink.  Even the buricha was lousy!   Basically a tall glass of water with a barely detectable barley flavor.  The real fun came when the bill came.  We were charged $1.95 each for the "buricha" and then $2.50 for the lettuce for the BBQ.  I complained to the owner who told me "we have to make the buricha - we don't keep it!"  Uhmm... okie dokie.  And charging for lettuce to go with our $35 of BBQ?  Puleez!    If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  Just awful.

We heard they were having a special on "boat noodles" for five dollars a bowl so we stopped in to try them.  They were absolutely perfect.  We had the beef noodles, with generous chunks of beef and beef meatballs in a dark rich broth.  They are called boat noodles because, traditionally, this type of noodle was served on the river from a seller in a boat.  In Bangkok, these are usually very small bowls.  Here, they are American sized and a bowl is a good lunch or a light meal.  A simple thing, done perfectly.  And at five bucks, quite the bargain.  We'll go back for dinner some other time.  This restaurant is a bit nicer than the average Thai restaurant in terms of ambiance and the service was rapid, quick and bilingual.

Stopped by for a Happy Hour drink the other night.  When we walked in at 5:15, we were the only ones there.  Within half an hour it had filled up substantially.    First of all, it's a very nice-looking space, all dark wood and banquettes, like an old-time East Coast place.  The bartenders were super-friendly.  I ordered a Pimms Cup and it came in an actual proper Pimms cup much to my shock.    We ordered a few appetizers.  They were small but excellent.  I would go back just for the friendly staff and crowd with the good food and solid drinks as a bonus.

Not bad.    We moved to AZ from Bangkok and my wife is Thai and a superb cook to boot, so we're kind of a tough crowd as far as Thai food goes.  Most of the Thai food we've had in Arizona has been absolutely dreadful.  This wasn't that bad, but it's not all that special either.    When we saw the Yelp! reviews of this new restaurant we were anxious to check it out.  Lao food is also the food of Issan, as northeastern Thailand is called (where the people are mostly ethnically Lao or Khmer).   Anyway, Lao/Issan food is kind of like the soul food of Thailand - down home, earthy, super spicy and very delicious.  Also very hard to find anywhere in the States outside of L.A. or Vegas.    We scanned the menu for a long time searching for the Lao/Issan component but that did not appear to exist.  We asked the waitress - who couldn't speak Thai by the way - where the Lao food was and she said it was "all mixed in."  Uhmmm... okie dokie.  Basically, it's all 100% Thai food.  (As was every single other thing in the restaurant). Not that there's anything wrong with that, but we were kind of geared up for some nice spicy Lao food.  That wasn't going to happen.  The menu is a pretty standard Thai-American menu. Sadly, there wasn't even one of the classic Lao/Issan dishes.  Just the usual stuff.  We opted for the Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) and Yam Woon Sen, both traditional Thai dishes.   Both were okay, by American standards, not particularly spicy, even though we had ordered them that way.  Neither dish had fresh chilis.  The Yam Woon Sen was more of a laab with woon sen noodles but it was alright.  The Drunken noodles were okay.  Again, not nearly as spicy as they should be.    That little four-jar condiment tray isn't some Lao-Thai innovation, that's a "kreung prung," a standard Thai noodle shop item that's found on every table in Thailand.  It's supposed to supplement the fresh chilis in a dish, not supplant them.  The dishes need to have fresh chilis cooked in them as well, not just crushed dried chilis added on top.  The real problem is that honest-to-goodness Thai food just isn't acceptable to Americans - too salty, too sour, too fishy, too spicy - so it can only survive in communities like LA or Vegas where there is enough of a Thai population to support it with exclusively Thai patrons.  Anyway, big portions, although a tad expensive with virtually everything on the menu over $10.  If you're hungry and in the neighborhood it's okay, but I wouldn't make a special trip.  If you really want to have traditional Thai food, your best bet is to get invited to one of the Thai temples on a festival day, when all the older Thai women bring home-cooked food.

Outstanding!    Places like this are a dime a dozen in Beijing or Monterey Park, but not so common here.    Big, hearty portions of hand-made noodles.  Dumplings the size of a fat plum, full of meat.  Grandpa making noodles by hand and dozing in a chair in between courses.  What's not to like?  This is northern Chinese "stick to your ribs" style.  Nothing fancy but perfectly executed.  I love it, personally but some people here are apparently a bit less enthusiastic.    Just thinking about it makes me hungry.  The display kitchen is a nice touch.  Great value too.  A huge lunch for two and an extra order to go for later ran us about $24.

Just not our scene.  Nice - I guess.  I don't know. It's new anyway.  No cover.  No dress code (judging by the people in shorts and flip flops on a Saturday night).  No service.  (We were there for half an hour and never got a drink.)  Honestly the worst band I've ever even imagined.     The combination of sports bar/nightclub doesn't work for me.  At all. Be one or be the other.  Don't try to be both.  The place was packed so I guess I am in the minority.    We stayed for half an hour, never got a drink and grew tired of the truly heinous cover band.

We stopped in here tonight with a restaurants.com coupon (and the low expecations that usually come with that) and we were very pleasantly surprised by a really tasty meal, pleasant atmosphere and great service.  It's also an excellent value.  We had the ceviche tigre and pappa rellena to start. Both were artfully presented with much more care than you would expect in a restaurant in this price range.  The pappa was perfect: flaky, delicious and not oily in the least.  The ceviche tigre was absolutely out of this world, a perfect mix of fish, squid, lime, corn and spices.  We would have been very happy with a meal of that alone.  For our mains, we had a lomo saltado and mixed seafood platter.  The lomo was exactly right; a slightly salty stir fry of steak, onions and french fries, served with rice.  The mixed seafood platter was a gargantuan plate of shellfish on top of a large fish fillet.  Both were delicious.  The only criticism I could possibly make is that I wasn't crazy about the yucca that accompanied the seafood platter (I'm more of a yucca al mojo guy) but that's a minor detail.     All of that food only came to $50, which is a great deal in my book, particularly with such a large amount of seafood.  With a Groupon/Restaurants.com coupon, it's a steal.  Our server Paola, was charming and helpful.  Recommended.

Great food, great service, reasonable prices.  It's in an excellent location at the corner of Indian School and 56th Street.  I love the look of the place.  It manages to have a clean modern look but still be warm and welcoming too.  Our server was friendly and engaging.  I had the jerk pork chop and my wife had the paella.  Both were excellent.   We had a nice petite syrah with that.  Prices are very reasonable, with most of the entrees in the mid-teens and most of the bottles of wine in the low 20's.  Dinner for 2 is going to run you about $60 with wine and you can't beat that.  A great neighborhood restaurant.

I'm afraid I'm going to have to dissent from the majority here and say that we were very disappointed by this place.  We wanted to love it - great location, inviting atmosphere, very reasonably priced comfort food menu - we could use a place like this on our restaurant rotation.    Alas, that is not to be.  The problem is the food.  Everything else was perfect and the service was excellent but I'm sorry to say, this is some of the blandest food I've ever had.    There were four of us at dinner and nobody liked their food.  Every dish was OK (as in edible) but nothing was particularly good. Every dish was under-seasoned and under-salted. Every single dish, from the bread to the dessert.   A few specifics:  Chopped Salad - As someone else commented, it looked like a child threw some things on a plate. That's spot on.  And peanut brittle?  Just say no to that idea please.  Osso Buco Confit -  Dry  and completely devoid of flavor, and a rather small portion on top of it.   Accompanied by a tablespoon of (once again) under-salted spaetzle.     Bread - Again, bland  - There were four of us and we didn't finish our small bread basket.  Everybody tried it and the reaction was, "ehh."  Fruit Cobbler - A ramekin of fruit in syrup with ice cream is not a "cobbler."  A cobbler implies either a pastry or biscuit topping.  There was none.  Very, very disappointing.  Pecan Pie.  A very poor execution of this American classic. Again, completely devoid of flavor.  The drinks were quite good and the service was excellent and friendly to a fault.  I love the idea of this place and I love the menu, but the food just did not deliver.

Terrific, authentically prepared Cajun food.  We stopped by the Phoenix Public Market yesterday to check out Food Truck Fridays.  It was almost 2 p.m. and they were getting ready to close so after quickly surveying the six trucks, we decided on Jamburritos.  We ordered the chicken and okra gumbo and the fried catfish special.  Both were awesome.  The gumbo was a fairly large portion that was rich, flavorful and chock full of sausage, chicken and okra.  Absolutely delicious and a steal at five bucks.  The catfish was completely non-greasy and cooked perfectly, served with rice and greens.  Highly recommended.

We heard about this place on Yelp, so being big fans of hot pot, we headed down to Chandler to check it out.  The first thing that strikes you walking in is the very pleasant atmosphere.  It feels more like a chill-out lounge than a Chinese restaurant, with nice colored mood lighting and some mid-period Bjork on the sound system.  This is much nicer than the typical Chandler ethnic restaurant and more of a "date place."  You are given a small paper menu (like a sushi menu) to tick off your selections on.  You pick the type of liquid that you'd like (we opted for the Yin Yang) and then you select your ingredients.  We had Tong-O (a peppery green), pea shoots, oysters, several kinds of mushrooms, shrimp, bean curd skin, pork blood, rib eye, beef tongue and firm tofu.  Everything was quite delicious.  Service was excellent and attentive and the owner stopped by at least three times to make sure we were happy.  We really liked the place and will definitely be back.  My only criticism would be that the portions were a bit skimpy for the price.  I would suggest either increasing the portion size or decreasing the price.   Our beef tongue order, for example, consisted of two paper thin slices of beef tongue, basically one bite, for four dollars.  That's a bit light, particularly for an offal product.  An order of soba noodles is less than one cup, which just seems a bit silly.    It ends up working out to $20 per person for a very light meal and that's a bit steep for Chandler.  But since they've only been open for 16 days, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on the portion issue.  Dinner for three with no alcohol was $60 including tip.

I will have to add to the overwhelming consensus that these guys are great!  After a very long, frustrating and unhelpful 3 hour visit to the Apple store, I found these guys on Yelp. They were able to diagnose the problems on my 3 year old Macbook Pro very quickly and do the necessary hardware upgrades (switch an HD to SSD, upgrade RAM, replace charger) at a price a bit less than half what the Apple store would have charged.  Very nice people also.  Highly recommended.

Superb! The single most interesting meal that we've had in Arizona. Highly recommended.  Food  5 stars+ Service 5 stars+ Atmosphere 3 stars   We had a really terrific meal here.  This is the only restaurant I've eaten at in this town that could compete with serious restaurants in NY or LA.    We shared 8 dishes (two $45 four-course menus) and followed our server's recommendations exactly on everything.  Pig Ears - a salty crispy snack up front  Albacore with apples, truffle and black garlic Yellowtail with controne and bottarga  Burrata with pancetta vinagraitte  Grilled Mozarella   Squid-ink Risotto Mushrooms with mozarella and egg  Veal breast Pork Belly with smoked tomatoes  We loved every single dish.  The stand-outs were the burrata, which was just sublime; the mushrooms with mozz and egg; and the pork belly, the perfect crescendo to the meal.  The courses build in a very logical progression that is a bit hard to explain.  Somehow the whole is greater than the sum of the parts here and it tastes far more impressive than it reads, with tremendous contrast between each of the dishes in each of the courses.    Our server, Ashley, was friendly, gracious and very-well informed and we never waited more than a minute or two for anything.  All of the support staff were right there with her in terms of professionalism and warmth.  Absolutely top-notch service in every respect.  A few minor quibbles.  Why no bread?  Yes, the cheese course comes with a piece or two of bread but since every plate emphasizes such delicious sauces, it is really crying out for some delicious homemade bread to run through that extra sauce.  It's a bit puzzling that they don't offer that.  The wine list is alright and we enjoyed the $60 Daou Cabernet we had - but a few more moderately priced wine specials would be nice.  The outsourced dessert was fine but a restaurant of this caliber deserves a pastry chef. After such a stellar multi-course meal, you really want to be wowed by the dessert. The rather ordinary apple tart seems a bit out of place here.  The only thing I just didn't like was the restaurant space itself, which doesn't seem so much minimalist as it does unfinished.  Such luxurious food deserves a more luxurious atmosphere. When we walked in, my wife said "Did they just open?"  Because it looks like they just opened and haven't had a chance to finish the interior space.  Hang some stuff on the wall already!  Besides the blank walls, the space is just not that inviting and many of the tables in this cavernous space are directly in front of the kitchen and bathroom doors, which distracts from the food and the total experience.  The net effect of the atmosphere is kind of like watching a great actor perform in a garage. It's riveting but you'd love to experience it in a more suitable venue. In a town where the food scene is dominated by multi-million dollar chain restaurants serving comfort food, $16.00 "gourmet" burgers and frat-boy sushi, this place stands head and shoulders above the competition. I'd love to see the chef get the space he deserves.  The total bill for a splendid two hour dinner was $204 plus tip.

I've written lots of restaurant reviews, but this is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write one for a doctor.  My experiences with Dermatique have been so positive, I feel compelled to share them with the local Yelpers.  I discovered Dr. Davey's practice last year after becoming dissatisfied with the service at the biggest and best known place in town (the big one out east on Shea).  Dermatique is a boutique medical practice located in the same building as Searsucker (next to Neiman's at Fashion Square).  Dr. Davey is pretty much everything you're looking for in a doctor - extremely experienced, totally engaged and with a terrific bedside manner.  He's got state of the art equipment and - contrary to a lot of local doctors - his staff is just as warm and gracious as he is.  The office is hyper-modern and always makes me feel like I've walked onto the Nip/Tuck set.  Despite the five-star ambiance, I've found Dr. Davey and his staff to be extremely helpful in working with insurance and generally making a visit that most of us would just as soon avoid about as pleasant as it could possibly be.  Highly recommended!

Not terrible but very expensive and a bit of an odd presentation.  I stopped in for lunch the other day and sat at the bar.  I found the menu a bit confusing but finally settled on the porkbelly with collard greens.    It arrived quickly.  The plate was a 5 inch square plate with what was perhaps a 3 oz. piece of porkbelly sitting on top of about a cup of collard greens.  For $12.00.  What was odd, was the porkbelly was sitting in a good half inch of the liquid from the greens, but all I was given was a fork to eat it with and there was also no bread.  Did I mention it was $12.00?  At lunch? I asked for some bread and they brought it out quickly.  The pork belly was pretty good although a bit on the dry side.  The collards were just fine but it's hard to mess up collard greens isn't it?  I asked for the menu again and now I noticed that everything is a la carte, even on the lunch menu.  So I guess I was supposed to order a side of potatoes for an additional six bucks.    As another Yelper has pointed out, this is after all a restaurant sitting in front of the Walmart so this all seems a bit pretentious.  Look, I don't mind paying for good food in the least but I do object to being presented with a tapas sized portion when I order an entree, particularly when it is involving such low food cost items as pork belly and collard greens.  Seriously, come on guys, what is your food cost on this dish?  I'll guarantee you it's under two bucks.  In my book, that's a rip-off.    Anyway, I'm not really sure Paradise Valley needs such a precious restaurant but I guess time will tell.   I left hungry and $16.00 poorer.  Finally, I don't get this recent bizarre and unwelcome trend I've observed recently of nice (and expensive) restaurants not serving bread .  What's up with that?  If you're going to serve traditional European/American food and charge a lot of money, bring some nice artisan bread to the table.

Stopped in here when I was in the neighborhood. I had the carne asada 3 taco special and it was very good, much better than I expected. My portion was just fine.  I will definitely be back.
