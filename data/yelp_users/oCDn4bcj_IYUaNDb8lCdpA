I am definitely a fan. I have been many times and it never gets old for me. LOVE their happy hour specials. The salmon carpaccio is to die for, and their drinks are pretty good.  I usually hit up RA on a monthly basis or more :)

Coming from LA where i see thai joints on every block, i decided to try this one out on my date. The food was really good! crab wontons were amazing!. I ordered the spicy noodle and the waitress asked me "do  you want american hot or thai hot?" and i chose american hot just to play it safe. I totally should have went for thai hot, seeing as i asked for some sriracha on the side and dumped it all over my food :)  The place was very cute, modern, and was not loud so i was actually able to hold a great conversation on my date.   Definitely coming back here!

Heard the music from down the street so i was looking to get my groove on. Didnt expect there to be a huge pool in the middle of the club. No room to do anything really.
