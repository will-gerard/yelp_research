I wish I lived closer, I know it is not NYC,  but I enjoyed the theater and the performance.  I had a fantastic time watching Ten Chimneys, it was a fun show.

What a fabulous place.  We had a blast last night and we can't wait to come back with the twins.

The reviews are spot on.  My husband and I went to this place for an early dinner.  Yes, the area looks a little rough but it was pretty early.  I followed the recommendation of other yelpers and ordered the shrimp culichi, very good choice.  My husband had the Torito de camaron, a yellow chili filled with shrimp, even better choice than mine.  The salsas were so good, the tomatillo one had enough spice for me.  I can handle spice, the red one was great too, however a bit too spicy for me this week.  Maybe another time I might enjoy it more.  My husband loved it.  We also had the shrimp meatball soup, very well seasoned and delicious. BTW I loved their corn tortillas and they told me they get them at the Sonorense.  They were fresh and cooked to perfection.  I dipped them in the green salsa, YUM. The margaritas are ok, but I was really here for the food.

I have been coming to Pane Bianco since before the twins were born and before they expanded.  I love my fresh Mozzarella sandwich.  I had an appointment in downtown PHX, so I could finally get a fix.  It had been a few months since I had been able to go and get my sandwich.  I do agree with Iain B.  $10 for a sandwich is pretty hefty, but I cannot help but stop by when I am without the twins.  I was able to sit down at one of the picnic tables outside, yes it was hot, but that is why I live in AZ,  and enjoy my book while I ate my yummy treat.  My husband usually gets the Market sandwich, I had a taste of a few, they are really good, but nothing beats my choice.

I liked this place, I wish it was not freezing cold inside, otherwise I would have stayed longer.  I had a strawberry lemondrop martini, it was delicious.  The place has a very cool vibe.  There were not many patrons when we went, of course it was a little early for a Saturday night.   Yes, the drinks are not cheap, but it is worth for a fun night with friends.

I stopped by this store on my way to an appointment.  I really like these stores.  I ended up with two pairs of pants, 3 blouses, a coat and some lacy stockings.  Sonya was very helpful and the selection was great.  I usually shop at the Kierland one, but I was in this part of town, so I am glad I stopped by.

I agree with Dottsy Z., this place is more like a 4.5 stars.  We had a wonderful time with friends this weekend.  Good company always makes an experience so much better.  This is a really cute place tucked away on Osborn between 22nd and 23rd streets.  I cannot believe I have not been here before or that I never heard of it.  Service was great, we had Justin as our server.  We  started with the brie, it was very good, however when we got it our server came to take our order, so until we all got done with that , our brie had gotten cold.   I had the fish of the day, which was cooked to perfection.  My hubby had the pork, delicious.  Our friends had the coq au Vin and and array of vegetarian sides.  They were very accommodating and served my friend a beautiful all vegetarian dish, side of potatoes au gratin (they were YUM), ratatouille, and vegetables. For dessert, we shared a creme brulee, my hubby had the apple tart, very delicious and our friend had the bread pudding, also outstanding.  This is a restaurant that is so cute for date nights or any special occasion, the setting is so quaint and beautiful. This is a place I would gladly come back over and over.

This is the best Rubio's in town.  The employees and management are so friendly and accommodating.   I am on the Hcg diet and they work with me to make things I can eat.  Every time I am in Old Town for an appointment I make sure it is around lunch time so I can go to this Rubio's.   The place is very clean and they seem to be very happy working here.  Shout out to Steven, he is really nice to all customers.

Can't wait to go back.  I love the Monday deal, it is genius.  I was there with my twin mom group (about 12 moms of twins), we had a blast.  I love the Brie, Apple and Fig, Prosciutto, Fig and mascarpone, Tomato jam bruschettas.  I had the Teira Zinfandel, which was perfect.

I feel like I have come full circle.  I started at this location 8 years ago.  Then Alisa was assigned to the Scottsdale location and of course, I had to follow her. Now she is back to the original spot, it is farther for me, but I will drive to bfe for her.  I cannot tell you how many times I get stopped at malls or on the street an inquired about my hair color.  Just yesterday I had a lady asking me if it was a single process hair color.  I told her it was not.  It requires the expertise of Alisa to make it look this natural.  When Alisa was on maternity leave the first time, I was impatient and I went somewhere else, and they left me brassy.  The second time Alisa went on maternity leave I wore a hat for a while.

When I want traditional, old school italian, this is the place I choose.  It was my mother in law's birthday and as in previous years, we invited them for dinner.  Last year I took them to another Italian restaurant, and my father in law was scanning the menu and said: "where are the spaghetti and meatballs?" The waiter at that restaurant replied: "we don't do spaghetti and meatballs".  My father in law was not pleased, so I was not going to make that mistake again.  I made our reservations, even though it was during the week.  The restaurant seems to have a regular crowd at the bar.  Our server was very attentive and efficient.  Of course my father in law got his spaghetti and meatballs, actually he asked for half meatballs and half sausage and they were very accommodating.  My mother in law had the eggplant parmesan, my hubby had the special ravioli and I had the cannelloni.  It was delicious.  We finished with a piece of tiramisu cake and coffee.  At the end of the meal they offered us a round of Amaretto.  It was a wonderful meal and my in laws were very happy this year, score!

What can I say, Rubio's rocks.  I can go to almost any of them and they are very graceful and accommodating to my diet needs.  This one is on the way to my kids old school, so I could stop here and get some to go items.  The manager and employees are very nice.

I am a big fan of Dillard's and its great sale.  Twice a year they put most shoes at 65% off.  It used to be 75% a few years back.  Good all days.  You can find amazing shoes at a bargain.  I got a pair of Coach wedges I've been using like crazy lately.    The dress section is also really nice.  I found a few great dresses for party season.  And the purses, ahh, they have a few good ones on the sale area.  I am trying to curb my purse and shoe addiction, Dillard's is not helping.

This location has it down!  They know how to handle families with kids.  We come here about once every ten days.  They are very fast and always bring the kids food first, which makes for a more relaxed time (if you can relax with two year olds).  The twins love the chicken nuggets and last time they had sundaes for the first time!  My little boy grabbed the cup and chugged the last drops down.  We've been to other locations, however this one has the best service and my husband thinks the best and strongest margaritas (hey, daddy needs a margarita, too)

I have been meaning to update my review for a while.  The last few trips to this CPK have been very successful and for me that deserves an extra star.  They are also very accommodating.  I had to change a few items due to my diet (yes, back on it) and they were great.  I noticed a few new items and I had one of the moms order it.  It looked great and she said it was delicious.  CPK also catered one of our Parenting Group's event.  They did a fantastic job and the food was delicious.

Very good Rubio's, very accommodating for my diet needs and the kids love their taquitos.  It is in a convenient location when you are shopping and don't have time to go home.  The management seems to be on top of things and keep the place very clean.

I had a great experience, of course I was with my favorite group of moms so how can I not have a good time.  We were about 20 twin moms  and the restaurant had our table ready and Josh our server was on top of everything.  The appetizers were delicious.  My glass of wine was very good.  Of course, wine makes everything better and isn't it considered healthy?

Yes, it is a little pricey, but it is so much fun.  Every time we have a moms night out at this place, we have a blast.  They let us take over the whole back room and we bring drinks and appetizers, we have such a feast that sometimes we have only 30 minutes to finish which ever piece we are supposed to paint.   Last time I was so much wiser and I chose a small plate, presto, it was done in less than 30 minutes and it turned out great.

I used pass this place every time I went to the movies or to get my nails done next door.  My husband loves vietnamese food, so he had been there a couple of times.  Finally I agreed to go with him before a movie.  I am hooked on the shredded chicken sandwich.  A great combination of veggies (carrots, cucumber, sprouts) and very well seasoned chicken on a crunchy baguette.  My husband had the pho.  I am not big on soups, so I tasted his, I could actually eat that next time, although I have been to this place and I feel like a broken record, I always have the chicken sandwich.

I went after a Holiday shop event at my twin group organization.  Someone mentioned that Coach had an additional 30% off on items that were already 50% off.  Of course, I had to go see that, I had never been to the outlets and I am not one to go to them, because most are not worth the time.  However, like my husband would say, whenever I hear sale, something starts ringing in my head and it becomes like an Olympic competitive event for me.  So, armed with this information I drove from central Scottsdale to Anthem, yes, about 30 miles out of the way.  What can I say, I don't mind driving?  The energy in the mall was bustling, it was really busy on a Saturday evening.  I parked near the Coach store, my feet were already killing me, even though I was wearing this Cole Hahn shoes "with Nike technology" that are supposed to be easier on your feet.  Of course, my hubby had to chime in, he said I am not supposed to wear heels for over 9 hours, but back to the outlet, the energy was so intense I wanted to stay and check out the other stores.  I tried, but darn my feet were hurting.  I have to come back and check out the rest.  By the way, I am not known for my sensible shoes, but they are really beautiful.

This place is great for a family experience.  We arrived early enough to have peach pancakes for breakfast.  After we rode the train to have an idea of where to go next.  This place is really big.  We took the twins to the pony rides and after to the amusement park area.  My kids had a blast.  They were too exhausted so we couldn't go pick our own peaches, so we bought some at their country store.  It was a blast, the kids napped for over 3 hours.  Yeay, mommy had a break.

This park is beautiful.  My little boy is obsessed with train, so this is heaven for him.  We ride the train, then the carousel and after playing in the playground we visit the model train museum.  They have so many model trains in this air-conditioned area.  My kids go up and down the different aisles.  It is a great  and inexpensive way to spend a morning or afternoon with your kids.

I love this Lowe's, it is super organized and really clean and nice.  I usually come to get flowers and plants for my yard.  Yesterday, I needed a faucet.  While I was there, I decided to check on carpet, my twins have been a little rough on the carpet in the living area and I wanted something that I can put for the next couple of years, until they grow up.  They ride these ex-rollers around, so  I need something durable.  Chris was very helpful, I was about to get a berber and he steered me clear from it.  His suggestions made so much sense.  I was so happy we were able to talk to him.

I am a fan of this store.  They have some cute stuff to add to my wardrobe.  I got a few tops and tons of belts.  I go quite often and I didn't realize that I bought the same belt twice (in the same color).  I love to find great stuff in the sales rack and specially when they have an additional % off.  Last time I got a cute skirt and several awesome socks. Service is always nice.  I need to ask the gentleman who always helps me for his name, he is really great.

I came here for the first time with a deal of the day, don't remember which one, I had a really great experience with Krista.  I am now a regular and I love how easy it is to either book online or call/text Krista and get an appointment.  They have the best prices for shellac/gelish manicures.  I wash my hands constantly and this is the only kind of manicure that will last more than three days.  I actually get bored of having the same for so long, which is a great thing.

This place is the bane of my existence.  How can I keep my diet when they are in the same plaza as my hair dresser.  Every time I get my hair done I stop and get a few cookies.  I cannot even wait until I get home to start eating them. The banana chocolate chip is so good.  I really liked their pumpkin chocolate chip I had last week.  Why 4 stars?  Last time the cookies were a little undercooked and the texture was too cake like.  I hope it was only an off day.  I'll be seeing them in a week.

I love this toy store.  Not only do they have unique toys, they also put many events for the community.  I love their toy testing event.  They set up in the parking lot and the kids can test different new toys.  This past weekend we went to the sale.  You get a large shopping bag and you pay $39.99 for everything you can fit in it, while still being able to grab it from the handle and not ripping the bag (it is made out of brown paper).  The only bad thing this weekend where those two FAT ladies (like 400 lb. fat), you know who you were, who were trying to hog everything and not letting people grab stuff.  I think the managers were going to address  the issue.  You were supposed to only get one bag, pay for it and go back in line.  Hopefully next year they will be able to do it a little different.  I am looking forward to their Easter Egg hunt.

I have been coming to this store for a few years now, but lately it seems I am only buying shoes for the twins.  They have great shoes for boys and girls.  I ended up buying 2 pairs for my little boy and 3 for my little girl, after all a girl needs more shoes.

After years of spending hundreds of dollars a week in dry cleaning, I discovered Montecarlo Cleaners about 5 years ago.  I love this place.  I was a little hesitant at the beginning, I couldn't believe they were charging only 1.99 per piece, no matter what piece.  I gave it a try and I was impressed.  In five years I  have only had one incident with a piece being damaged, however the owner himself, Frank, gave me a call and paid for my husband's shirt.  They raised the price to 2.25 a piece now, but it is still an awesome deal compare to other places.  I don't understand why you have to charge almost $10 for a dress to be dry cleaned.  I will gladly recommend this place to anyone.

Dear Anthropologie, I think it is best if we part ways.  For years I've been shopping with you, but as much as I try to like the stuff I buy, I end up sending it to the consignment store, with the tags on.  Your catalogs are so beautifully magical that it skews my decision making.  I am tired of your 60s tablecloth fabric on almost everything. And the fit, who is designing this stuff, don't they know where the waist is supposed to be? It makes anyone in real live look matronly.  I know I am not a spring chicken, but I am definitely a sassy dresser.  I got your discount card for my birthday.  I know you know I cannot pass up a sale or a discount, but I will make an exception this time. Cheers!

Last year, my friend Alison threw a breakfast birthday party for her twins.  She had a array of wonderful goodies, among them, there were these beautiful bagels.  I got a bite into my bagel and it was heaven.  The right amount of chewiness.  I immediately asked where these bagels came from, and I was not alone, everyone at the party was doing the same.  That's when I learned about NYBB.  Now every time someone has a brunch or breakfast party, I always suggest they get their bagels.  If I am going to indulge, I better do it with great ones.  I am not from NY but a am a confirmed carb-aholic, so I think this counts as credentials. On top of everything, the owner was so amazing.  I was organizing an event for one of my parenting groups, and one of the donors backed out 4 days before the event.  I was panicking, we had a small budget and we were almost out of it since we were counting on this donation.  I called NYBB and Ruth answered.  I told her what had happened and asked her if she could give us a special discount, guess what?  She donated the bagels for our event.  That is so classy.  I am thrilled that our event has the best bagels.

I thought I had a torn triceps, so my surgeon friend recommended Dr. Gruber.  He was awesome, however, the front office is horrible.   It turned out it was not a torn triceps, so Dr. Gruber wanted me to have an MRI and he told me we should get the result asap, to see if he needed to refer me to another Dr.  When I tried to schedule my MRI, they told me that I needed my insurance to pre approve and that they needed the transcript.  I tried to contact the office, Cindy was so unprofessional and mean.  When I told her Dr. Gruber wanted me to have the MRI within the next two days, she said: The Dr. can say whatever he wants, but we cannot do anything until the transcript is back".  It turned out, my insurance didn't need pre approval, when I called to schedule for the results, again Cindy was horrible.  She was trying to schedule me for over a week out.  When I told her it was for the results and that I didn't need a pre approval like she had said, she replied: "You just don't understand, I'm not going to try to make you understand", I told her "don't".  Thank goodness Dr. Gruber's assistant called me back and gave me the results over the phone.  Dr. Gruber was going to do the surgery, but I waited a couple of months, so I could deal with his new private practice, because I certainly didn't want to deal with that office anymore.  I didn't want to call her names like in the other reviews, but it is accurate.

I love coming to this location.  The yearly mammogram trip is no fun but there is no way around it. The front desk people are very professional and fast.  I was called to the back and headed to get my test.  After the technician was done, she asked me if I wanted to wait for the results.  I already knew about this service, that is why I chose this location.  Yes,  if you wait 30 minutes in the waiting area they will come back with your results.  If you have to have your tatas squeezed, might as well get the answer fast.

I was in the area and I remember I used to go to this place about  5 years ago.  It was blah.  Nothing special.  There was only one waitress for a Saturday morning crowd.  That should have been my first clue.  She was nice enough, but it was still early.  There were only 4 tables with patrons, so I think she was managing.  I had the french toast, what can I say, it didn't taste like challah dipped in the egg mixture as they claim.  Not bad, but it was your run of the mill dinner french toast.  Usually when I am going to blow my calorie budget, I want it to be worth it. Now I just feel guilty and want to hit the treadmill.  I know I won't be coming back with the twins either, because the couple that came in while I was finishing my breakfast requested a high chair and the waitress told them all the straps in the high chairs where broken.   I need to make sure I keep my little rug-rats strapped if we don't want chaos.

After leaving another place without breakfast, we decided to try Lox Stock & Bagel.  This was a good choice.  Bagels and Bialys are really great.  I was able to get a great bialy sandwich.  My husband had the chicken salad bagel sandwich.  It was great tasting.  And my little girl was very entertained while she ate her scrambled eggs.  We will be coming back to taste other sandwiches.

Rubio's helps me keep my diet, so I can eat out more often, haha.  This is my go to Rubio's after the gym.  As another yelper mentioned, the location is a little tricky and sometimes it is hard to find a parking spot.  Francisco, the manager is very personable and accommodating.  They have a few choices that are a lot healthier and they even make stuff for me that is not in the menu.

I think this is my favorite nail place.  It is your typical vietnamese run nail shop, however, it seems that my nails last forever when I get them done here.  Usually my manicure peels or chips in 4 days.  After all I have 3 year old twins and I am washing and soaking my hands in water all day long. But, I just noticed it last time, my mani lasted over a week.  I couldn't believe it.  My pedi would last about three weeks if I wouldn't get bored with the color.  Although I am partial to Bubble Bath, once in a while I switch it up and use other colors.

This has been a tradition for a couple of years now.  A few of the twin moms get together for breakfast around  10am after shopping or volunteering at the big consignment semi-annual sale we have each april and october.  This year, I did not volunteer or shopped, however I couldn't pass up this tradition.  I love to hang out with my girlfriends at any opportunity I get.  This year the group was a little smaller, however we always have a great time.  Of course, I had to have the mimosa flight.  Mimi's is always consistent and very accommodating.  Yes, it is a chain, but service is always friendly and the food is food, although always too much.  This branch is a little farther for me, so I will see you back in October.

I've been coming to this Sprouts for over 8 years now, wow, time flies.  I love the way they keep their vegetables and fruits.  It looks so appealing.  I end up buying more than I was planning.  Sometimes they have great deals on organic produce.  I try to eat organic as much as possible.  I like that their ground beef comes from grass fed cows, and their pork loins are the leanest I have found.  I get some supplements there also.  It is a little far from my house, but worth the trip.

Where to start. I am still upset.  My husband and I usually avoid chains, but since we had the twins we are getting more intimate with some chains.  We were trying to find a new one since the other two we go to have been beaten to death.  With two year old twins choices are a little scary.  I went along and agreed to go to Arriba.  Last time we were there was 4 years ago and it was your typical mediocre fare, which is fine for a quick lunch during work week. First we order for the kids, the chicken fingers and what I thought would be strawberry smoothies.  What a surprise when I had a sip and realized it was a virgin strawberry daiquiri. I was giving my twins pink sugar water.  Not the end of the world.  I ordered some milk.  Then my husband and I were going to share the chicken fajita quesadilla.  The waiter, Omar, seemed fairly nice.  He came by a second time to verify if I wanted beef quesadilla, and I told him "No, I want chicken, no beef please".  Then he pushed for us to add the guacamole and sour cream, which I said fine to bring it with it and I repeated "chicken quesadilla". When it came the quesadilla looked like a sad greased soaked blanket.  My biggest surprise came when I took a bite and guess what I found? "Beef".  I had to spit it out and call Omar, I explained to him this was a beef quesadilla, he gave me this puzzled face and asked: You didn't want beef? I thought it was a joke, by that time the twins were getting rowdy and they had not touch the rock hard fried to death chicken fingers.  So I told him to take off the quesadilla and we would pay for everything else we didn't eat but had ordered.  Afterwards we called from the car and talked to the manager. He wanted to do "something for us", but I told my husband I didn't want to go back, so we didn't accept anything.  I guess CPK with the kids again.

This has been one of our regular breakfast spot for the past six years.  Before the twins we would hang out all morning on Sundays, spread our papers and relax and comment about the different articles we were reading.  We still go, but now we have to hit the fast forward button and make sure we stay enough time that the twins are not bored.  We try to be considerate towards the other patrons.

I can't believe I have not written a review for this Wildflower.  I have been coming to this location for over 8 years, even before their remodel.  Before the twins I used to love hanging out with my hubby on Sunday mornings having breakfast and reading the paper.  That went out the window once the twins came, but I still go for lunch a few times a month.  They have this amazing Chicken, Pistachio Pomegranate salad.  I am hooked on it.  The only thing that is annoying about this place is how busy it gets and how many people hog the big booths.  I have seen so many individuals taking the whole booth just for them and their pc.  They seem to have been there so long, so many of them have their bare feet up on the other side of the booth, yes, I mean you skinny guy on the booth next to me.  I didn't need to see your feet.  EEK.

This is a great Rubio's, I don't know if there is new management but it seems so much nicer than a few years back.  I stopped by with the twins to see if they would eat here. There are so many happy meals I want to give them.  To my surprise, they loved the chicken taquitos.  They devoured them.  I am so happy I have another option when I am out with them.  The employees are very nice and keep the place very clean.

I loved this zoo.  The experience is amazing.  You can see the animals so close.  We went with another couple who also has twins, so it was a blast.  We started at the west entrance because we wanted to leave the aquarium and "wet" experience towards the end.  There are several stations where you can feed animals.  Make sure you get change at the gate ( you need quarters for the machines).  I didn't mind that everything is pretty much "a la carte".  The skyride is $4 per person.  It is worth every penny.  It was so much fun to ride above the zoo and observe the animals.  So beautiful.  The train ride was also $4 per person.  The carousel was $2.50 a person and feeding the rays was $3, which my little boy had a thrill.  He couldn't stop laughing whenever the rays touched his little fingers.  I got to touch them too, they are funky in a cool kind of way.  The only one that we thought was a little steep was the Log Flume ride, at $6 a person, we decided it was not worth it. The kids had a blast at the petting zoo, they still talk about it even a week after being there.  Another thing that was great was having a real restaurant available inside the zoo.  They have a Dillon's in there by the stingray station. We spent 6 hours there and we couldn't believe we missed the penguins.  I guess we will have to go back.  We all agreed, we couldn't find a reason to go to the Phoenix zoo anymore.

I love this zoo, our family prefers this one over the other famous one.  We come here at least 4 times a year.  We enjoy the interaction with the animals.  The jaguars are so close you could touch them, although that would be ill advised.  We love the parrot feeding, it is at 11:00 am and you get to pick up a piece of apple and the birds will fly to you.  At one point I had about 4 or 5 birds on one arm.  The giraffe station has changed so it is a little harder to feed them.  They are always adding, I can't wait to see the new seal pool, it is going to be so cool.  My little boy keeps wanting to go to the ship (the shape of the theater where the seal pool is).  They started at the beginning of the year and it is still under construction as of September 28th/14 when we went last.  The aquarium is really great, so many things to enjoy.  We don't mind having to pay for the different options they have.  The sky lift is $4 per person and it gives you a birds eye view of the zoo.  The train ride is under remodeling also, as well as the boat ride.  The tram ride on the new Safari Park is $5. You don't get to see as much of what is in the safari park, so make sure you walk through it. I love that they have a restaurant instead of just the concession stands. Dillon's is not the best, but for a park it is a great option.  We love to sit by the shark tank.  My kids love watching those sharks go around and around.  There is a sting ray station outside the restaurant.  I tried feeding them ($3), but it freaked me out so much I ended up tossing the little shrimps.   Hickman's egg cartons has a coupon, buy one get one.  I am stocking up on them.

I am extremely disappointed.  I planned my whole Sunday around this area, since we wanted to see the puppet show.  The twins were talking about it all morning long.  We went to lunch, and then the twins said " puppet?", it was still a little early so we stopped by to get to sweets to take home.  We got there at 1:15p.m.  They told us to be there by 1:30 since then is when they open the doors and it is first come first serve.  There were two families before us.  The place seemed a little cleaner than last time we were there.  We got in and sat in the carpet (which is the closest for the kids).  The seats are now a little farther away, so I had to sit also on the floor to the side by my twins.  I don't like to leave them unsupervised yet (yes, I am a little bit of a helicopter, they are 4 after all).  The show was supposed to start at 2:00p.m.  The cute little brothers in front of us were asking us the time every five minutes.  When it was 2 they got all excited, but nothing.  10 minutes went by and nothing.  20, nothing, I had to whip out my iPhone and give it to my little girl to have her watch some netflix to keep her calm, my hubby did the same with our little boy, for a while we had a crowd surrounding our kids around the phones.  Finally at 2:30, after sitting in the hard floor for an hour they tell us they are going to start, so they begin with their schtick and "rules", this started to go on and on, it seems like they are frustrated comedians trying their material on this audience.  After 15 minutes I had to leave, because my kids could not take it any more.  I cannot blame them.  They were very good for one hour and 15 minutes of doing nothing but sitting on a hard floor.  I am glad it was a Groupon and not full price, I didn't even ask for a refund, because I am never, ever, ever coming back.

I grew up in Ecuador,  and travelled across South America through my teens for several swim meets.  I love this place.  The food is the closes you can get to authentic.  I love the Mi Bandera (in Ecuador this dish is called Yapingachos), of course I have to love it, it has potato patties filled with cheese, what's not to love.  The ceviche is perfect, they even serve it with popcorn, the way the do it in Ecuador.  I love their Flan de Coco, coconut flan, so yummy I can feel my hips expanding just thinking about it.  I usually go on a binge when I have dessert.  It is good for my waistline that they are about 25 miles away from my home or I would be there every week.

This place was fantastic.  He held our organization's Holiday Party and Silent Auction here.  What a great place for kids.  My twins had a blast and the space lend itself so perfectly for our party.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating.  We moved furniture around since we had to use several tables from other rooms for our Silent Auction items.  The event was fantastic, unfortunately, I was so busy running around making sure everything went well with the silent auction that I didn't get to enjoy the space with my twins.  Good thing I had a sitter help my hubby.  I guess I'll have to come back soon.

I have lived here for 12 years and never been to BJ events before. My friend Shelly goes every year and this year was no exception. She and her fiancé invited us to join them on Friday.  We ended up getting there a little late, around 7pm. They were bidders so we got to go everywhere. After looking at a bunch of cars and getting some margaritas we sat to watch the auction. Her fiancé and my husband went on stage to check out the cars closely. She ordered some more margaritas from a really nice server, Marly, who was super sweet. My friend asked me to take the margaritas to our guys on stage. At that moment a Ferrari came on stage. Suddenly I see out friend bidding. The energy is contagious, it is crazy being in the middle of it. He ended up winning the bid. It was so funny, because I was jumping up and down, even though the car was not mine. We were laughing, screaming  and celebrating. My girlfriend at first was not thrilled, she was "what did you do?" We ended up staying there until the end. We then checked his new car and took more pictures. It was a fun night, so much fun and screams I had no voice the next day.

I like their clothes, they are pretty good quality.  The prices are not the cheapest, but it you can wait a few weeks, you can usually find something you wanted on sale.  Yes, I totally agree, customer service is not their strong suit.  It is surprising in this economy that they cannot find better staff.  I found a pair of nice dress pants, a pair of walking shorts, three tops and a dress for about $150.00.  I think that was a great deal.

I have been wanting to check this place out for years, but I wanted it to be a stress free brunch.  This Sunday we had a sitter come in early and we headed to Old Town.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table outside, which is ok considering it is such a popular place.  While we waited, we purchased two Halloween cupcakes for the twins (they were not really great, no one ate them).  On the other side, breakfast was delicious. I started with the morning glory cocktail, bubbly, pineapple juice and cointreau.  It is a generous size, so I had to switch to a mimosa for my second one (good thing I was not driving).  I had the Menage with monkey cakes, wow the best pancake I have ever had.  The banana and coconut combination was so delicious,  I requested it without almonds (I don't have any allergies, I just didn't feel like having almonds).  Ryan was our server and he was very efficient and friendly.  My hubby had the green Flannel and a couple of different coffee drinks.  He loved his breakfast too.  Next time we will bring the twins.

I love Colton Fox.  He is a brow artist.  I have been going to him for about two years now.  I read a segment on Eyebrows on InStyle magazine and they mentioned him, so I decided to try him.   He takes his time to design the best brow for your features.  He is very meticulous and will take up to 30 minutes to make them look perfect.  I can never go anywhere else anymore.  By the way he is so reasonable only $15 for an artist's work.

I love, love, love dates.  Until I got introduced to this place, I had only had medjool dates.  I didn't know we have a local date, the sphinx date.  Well, this is awesome or terrible, because I have been eating dates since the end of November almost everyday.  I love to chop a couple (more like three or four) on my salads.  I love how sweet and honey like the are.  We stopped on our way to an event in Tempe.  I think this is going to be my rule from now on.  I will stop only if I am close to it.  Besides the sphinx dates I am obsessed with, they also have the salted dark chocolate covered dates my hubby loves.  I am also addicted to these Prickly pear gummy candies.  Very dangerous indeed, I ended up finishing the box by myself in two days.  I will probably find an excuse to go soon, since I am down to 6 or 7 dates on the box.  The date milkshake is also a diet killer, but so yummy.

This review is just based on my Apple Pancake, it was AWESOME.  I got the junior size and I ended up giving half of it to my husband.  I wish I had more time before starting my Hcg diet.  I would have loved to try the Dutch Baby, it looked great.  Service was fine, they sent us to the back room since we had the twins, I don't get offended.  My hubby was not thrilled.  Good thing there was a little girl back there with a couple having breakfast. It made it so much fun for the twins.  They had their scrambled eggs and then they devoured most of my hubby's chocolate chip pancakes.  The place is as described by most, kind of 50s dinner vibe.  Good thing we read the reviews and brought cash.

I don't know if I should say I love this place or really dislike them.  They are dangerous.  It's like they know my number.  I was supposed to just passed by and head to another store, but I couldn't help it. I saw the shoe sale, they have it every few months now.  Tons of shoes for 65% off.  I guess a girl cannot have enough shoes.  Hey, my pretty shoes don't care if I gain or loose a few pounds.  Today, I got 3 more pairs. Danny helped me out, he has been in the shoe department forever.  I remember him helping me since 2006 at least, wow, that is 6 years now. I love some of the Gianni Binni Dresses, too (that is the house brand).  They are very well made and if you are lucky enough to catch them on one of the big sales you can score a great dress for under $80.00

Grr, this place can be so irritating.  There is ALWAYS a freaking loooong line to pay for your items.  I cannot understand why there is no manager who can fix this.  This is not during holidays, it is an everyday thing.  I have been coming to this torture chamber for over 6 years.  I usually try to go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels, but sometimes I don't feel like driving the extra miles, however, once I am in that line from hell, I wish I was driving to the other store.  On top of everything, most of the items are 20% to 30% more expensive than HL.  Also, you have to make a line to get a piece of fabric cut, during busy times you have to take a number, which should be used all the time, because there are people who will cut in front of you if there is no number calling that day.  Customer service is mediocre at best.  I am guessing they must not be paying more than minimum wage because people seem so unhappy and slow moving.

I needed a new dermatologist.  After reading several reviews, I found one about Dr. Jeffries, although now I cannot see it even in the not recommended.  I had a spot in my arm that was making me nervous, so I made an appointment with Dr. Jeffries.  The process as the other reviewer said was pretty easy, the only thing you have to be aware is that Dr. Jeffries works in the North Scottsdale office only on Wednesdays.  I had waited so long to check this spot, I could wait a couple more weeks.  After checking the website, I realized my husband had been to this practice about 9 years ago, it was much smaller then.  I went in and filled my paperwork, I was called in on time and the doctor was really nice.  She did a full check up of my skin spots.  The good news, its nothing I'm just getting old, so spots come with the territory.  She told me they could remove them, since it is considered cosmetic, it is out of pocket.  I made an appointment to take them out, since I sometimes scratch them and make them bleed.  Getting old is not fun!

What is not to love about this place!  A few friends decided to celebrate one of our girlfriends birthday at this resort.  We were supposed to arrive really early to take advantage of all this place has to offer.  However, stuff got in the way and I was the first one to arrive at 9:30.  I missed spin class and yoga class.  I checked in at the spa and the showed me the facilities and assigned me a locker.  Since they knew we were a group, she was going to keep the lockers on that side for us, that was very nice.  I headed to the fitness room with 2 of the ladies and worked out for about an hour, my friends abandoned me for the pool after 20 minutes.  I took a quick rinse in their beautiful showers, they are huge.  If you forget to shave, they have all you need there.  The infinity pool was delightful, and they have pool rafts and noodles if you want them.  Our lunch was very good.  I opted for a healthy meal, since I worked out hard, I had the seared ahi bento box, it came with some vegetables in two versions, raw and cooked and brown rice.  Very nice and filling.  One of our server was not the happiest, I think her name was Vanessa, but we were having too much fun to let that affect us.  I decided to have my spa service at the end of the day and that was a great idea.  I had a glorious facial and after it was done I got dressed and headed home, happy of having enjoyed a day of relaxation and fun with my girlfriends.

I like this store, I already know where everything is, so I don't waste time.  It is on the way to my home so I can stop here and get my groceries.  For some reason, if I am home, I go to the Summit Safeway, even though they are both the same distance from my house.  I guess it is a matter of custom.

I don't know why I don't come here more often.  They have a pretty good deal for happy hour.  Our last visit was for our International Super Club night.  I ended up coveting the dishes around me.  My hubby had the fesenjan, and it was really good.  He called it a persian mole.  Monica had a grilled chicken dish that looked delicious.  The tahdig was so yummy with all the hummus and baba ganoush.  I think their happy hour is until 8p.m. and they offer specials upstair on their drinks and appetizers.  I guess I need to make another trip to the Persian Room very soon.

I have been a patient of this practice for over 5 years now.  I have seen all the doctors.  I used to be a patient of Dr. Wilder, however she is only taking care of "Concierge" patients only.  Since I didn't want to pay thousands of dollars a year for this service, I had to request another Dr. as my main one.  I love Dr. Suedekum, she is great.  Very easy going and accommodating.  I did a couple of rounds of Hcg there and your will receive great personalized treatment from Kim.  The women at the front desk are very nice, but  I will miss Josh forever.

Oh Tasty Kabob, I wish you were closer to where I live.  I have been going to this place since 2005, my husband and I used to be there at least twice a month.  Now with the twins, it is a lot harder to take such a long trip.  I cannot have enough of the Fesenjan, it is a delicious stew, the complexity of flavors is amazing, we always have it with chicken.  Another item we always order is the Tadig, ahh, its crunchiness is magnificent.  I am salivating just thinking about it.  And one item you should never miss is the persian ice cream.  My husband has to order his own, I won't share.

We were on the West side and since we had a sitter, we decided to check out an authentic Mexican Bakery. Since my hubby is going back on Hcg, I am doing it for support too, we decided to go out with a bang. We used to go to a Mexican Bakery in Tampa, where they had this pastry that looked like a little pie filled with pastry cream.  I had not been able to find it in town, of course I have not looked very hard.  Well, this place had it.  It is called "Canasta".  We decided to buy a bunch of pastries, I think we got 10, we bought some for our sitter and her kids.  What a bargain for less than $10.  The "Canasta" was delicious, the crust was very good, however not the same texture as the one I had in Tampa.  Less shortbread like.  The apple turnover was very good too.  The only one I didn't care for was this twisted churro like pastry.  I little dry for my taste. I didn't try the Palmiere yet (Elephant ear).  Maybe with coffee this morning.  Good thing this place is over 30 miles away from my house, I couldn't afford the calories if they were closer.

I cannot believe I wasted my time and money.  I don't know what is going on, but all the pastries and bread tasted horrible.  I handed a churro to my twins and they returned it to me, so I took a bite.  It was stale.  I couldn't believe they could go stale.  That place seems to be so busy.  Then I handed them a cookie, again, they handed it back to me.  I took a bite and it was no good.  I then tasted a few of the other items, by the time we got home, the whole thing went in the trash can.  I had a horrible aftertaste in my mouth, almost like a filmy, greasy, lardy aftertaste, yuk.

I have come here several times since it is so close to my house.  During restaurant week, we decided to invite some friends to experience this place. This year it was $40 per person which is ok for the location.  We had not been here in a while.  The location is pretty nice and if the day is beautiful, you can enjoy dinner in their beautiful patio.  To start I had the beet salad and my hubby had the crab cakes, those were delicious, I wish I had chosen that.  I love beets, but my salad was not as great as I have had before.  For our entree I had the salmon and the hubby had the filet, those two dishes were amazing.  On the other hand, the desserts were underwhelming.  I prefer the dessert from the regular menu, specially the sticky caramel meringue terrine, yum.  If you go for lunch or dinner, the hamburgers and salads are HUGE.  An how can I forget my guilty pleasure, the bread basket has little corn bread muffins, those are the bomb, I could eat a dozen.  No wonder my pants are a little tighter now.

I love Durant's, I've been going there since I moved to the Valley 11 years ago.  My husband and I love sitting at the bar and enjoying the ambiance, the great cocktails and food.  I knew about the famous dessert chip, but I never tried to get one.  Every time we have guests from out of town, we love to take them there and guide them in through the kitchen.  It is always a hoot to see their face.  We went for our big dinner this past October and I had as usual my lemon drop martini and my husband had his margarita.  We started with the shrimp cocktail, it is really delicious, the shrimp are huge and the cocktail sauce has a lot of horseradish.  We decided to split the larger fillet and have it with the mash potatoes and some steamed asparagus.  The fillet was delicious, super tender and flavorful.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and garlicky.   For dessert we had the strawberry shortcake, it was good, but not my favorite.  I like their creme brûlée much better, but I wanted to try this one.  I got my chip! I just need to remember where I put it, haha.

I have always enjoyed coming to Tommy Bahama.  Ever since I went the first time a bizillion years ago to the Sarasota, FL location.  They are very competent with their meals and their drinks and desserts are out of this world.   I went with a group of 12 women, since we were staying at the Westin for our annual twin mom's weekend away from family.  We had a fantastic server, Alisa.  She was so attentive and kept everyone happy.  All of us were super impressed with her.  I had as usual my coconut shrimp.  I had a taste of one of my friends tortilla soup.  It was very tasty.  Our drinks were so good.  I had the Pineapple Jalapeño Mojito and the Raspberry Mojito.  Both were sensational, I think I liked the pineapple jalapeño a little better.  Not as sweet, but equally strong.  For dessert this time I wanted to try their newest one, the Pineapple Creme Brûlée, I was happy to share it with several friends, since all of their desserts are super rich and delicious but full of calories.  You can feel your hips expanding with every bite.  I stopped at three.  Now I will have to work out a little harder to compensate for all the fun I had this weekend.

I like hanging out at this place.  I usually meet my friend Anita here and we can spend a few hours chatting over coffee.  The place has a relax vibe and the coffee was very good. Besides coffee, they also have several items for breakfast and sandwiches and salads for lunch.  I went there on a Saturday and they have live music.  What a neat treat.

This was our third time at FEZ and I was debating whether to give it a 4, due to our last experience, but the sweet potato fries alone deserve the 5.  I think it was a little hectic this past Saturday, so I am going to overlook the service.  My husband had the Tangiers burger, it was awesome.  I had the Phyllo chicken pockets, yummy.  Our friends had the FEZ burger.  I can't wait to come for lunch and have my own burger.  We love the ambiance and how cool this place is.  It is such a pity that we have to drive so far to find gems.  Phoenix has some awesome restaurants!

You need to be prepared to spend some money here.  We got a gift certificate at Costco so it made it 30% cheaper, score.  My kids loved choosing their new friend.  My little girl got a little pony, they get to fill it, place a little heart inside, then after they are finished they take them to the "bath" area, where they brush their new friends.  It was so funny to see how serious my little girl was with her grooming skills.  Then they get to choose outfits for the plush toys, this is the part you should be afraid of, they can go crazy.  Thank goodness my kids were pretty tamed.  They got some boots and a cape, and my little girl got a "convertible bed" for her pony.  All in all the experience is fun.  I will be back to make another one sometime.

I have been going to SBG since they opened in 2005.  They have changed the menu a little bit, but it is still an awesome place to dine.  I was on yelp and decided to use their reservation option and it was so easy.  When we got there, we had no problem, however we decided we wanted to sit at the bar, we always like to chat with the bartenders.  Tom was really nice and very personable.  He recommended a great red blend and my hubby of course had his margarita on the rocks.  We started with the quesadillas to share as our appetizer, very nice.  I had the Enchiladas Suizas as my entree and my hubby had a chile relleno and the Azteca Soup.  Of course, he had some of my dish, too.  The guests sitting next to us tempted us with the dessert, so we ordered the bread pudding, wow, just like I like it.  SO YUMMY!

This is my favorite Pita Jungle.  The service, the food and everything is so much better that the D. Ridge one.  I almost always rather drive further and enjoy my meal.  Today it was a very successful lunch.  The twins ate almost everything on their plates.  They are always great at letting me pick 2 proteins instead of one. I think our server's name was Chris.  He was very nice and efficient. I had the Gambas al Ajo, shrimp on a tomato garlic sauce with some pita with pesto and cheese.  It was delicious.  My hubby wolf down his black bean burger.  He kept raving about the potatoes that were on the side.  We will definitely keep coming back.

Wow, I can't believe I haven't been here in years.  I should keep this place in my rotation more often, it is really awesome, however be aware it is really small.  They have pretty good wines on their list, but their margaritas are amazing.  The food is really spicy, my husband was in heaven.  I had the carne adovada sliders, so delicious and my husband had the pork, shrimp and beef enchiladas.  I had a taste of each of them, they were so yummy.  They also have a room for private parties, you can reserve it with $500, that will towards the bill that night, so it is a pretty good deal if you have a large group and you want to enjoy their food and drinks. Hmmm, my birthday is coming up pretty soon!

I didn't know that the MGM had such a big theater, it was surprising.  My husband's company hired Elton John to play for them and I scored a ticket, so I flew to Las Vegas for the last 3 days of my husband's event.  My experience is a little bit different probably, because this was a private event and there were no "ticket" lines and we had an open bar and food and drink available during the whole time Elton John was playing.  It was a lot of fun!

I had a really good time, but sometimes I think your experience at a restaurant is much better due to the company.  I really enjoyed our gigantic table.  It created a little bit of havoc for the server and it made service a little slow, but I will cut them some slack.  I ordered the pretzel, because I am a carb addict.  I was so happy we had such a big group, because after cutting a piece I could pass it around to share and not feel so guilty.  It was big enough that about 10 people were able to taste it.  I really liked it.  The spicy mustard was indeed spicy. Before our dinners we got split pea soup, it was very tasty, I am usually not a soup person, but I was hungry and I enjoyed it very much.  For my entree I ordered the Wiener Schitzel, I had not had baby cow in a long time, it was well worth it.  I ate only have of it and took home the rest.  It came with potatoes and wirsing.   The potatoes were very good, on the other hand, I personally didn't like the wirsing (a creamy cabbage concoction).  Good thing Amy liked it, lol. We ordered dessert, but they were taking so long that we asked to have our Black Forest cake and Cherry Strudel to go.  When I got home, I was trying to be so good and got only a third of the strudel, then gave my hubby a third and put the rest in the fridge.  Well that freaking strudel was amazing, I went back to the fridge and ate the rest.  The next day I went twice to the gym.

I love this place and my twins do too.  They are like the Pavlov dogs, as soon as they are done with their lunch at the restaurant next door, they walk out and immediately scream for ice cream, well gelato.  My little boy is expanding his horizons, he requested a taste of a different flavor and he picked his own flavor the last time we were there.  I guess pretty soon I will have no say in a lot of thing.  Not sure I am cool with that.  I wish they would allow two flavors in the small cup like at my favorite gelato joint.

My girlfriends and I have agreed that this is by far our favorite resort to spend a spa day at.  I love enjoying ALL the amenities.  I get there bright and early.  I have my hubby in charge of putting the kids on the bus and I head to the spa.  I like to start in the fitness center.  After I finished my little session, I was able to take the surf set class.  It was so cool.  I will try to post the picture the instructor took.  I had seen the surf set boards being promoted on shark tank.  We then head to the pool area to relax, and have lunch.  There is nothing more fun than a bunch of friends hanging out by the pool.  The facility is beautiful.  I usually get a facial, and my choice is always to take the last one of the day, since I don't want to get in the pool after that.  My girlfriends are finally getting why I choose late appointments.  Makes total sense.  If it is a massage it really doesn't matter.  We still have one move visit planned for this resort for next month.  Can't wait to go back.

This is one of my favorite Targets.  It is easy to access and usually on my way to different places.  I like how they remodeled it, to now offer groceries.  I don't know that it is necessary or how successful that will be, but the rest of the store is great.

This is my go to Movie Theater for watching movies in the afternoon.  You cannot beat $5.00.  I can come around 1 and watch something and then go pick up the kids.  The only thing I always forget is a sweater.  Place is freezing cold all the time.

I love this place.  I have visited it a couple of times and last time was for restaurant week.  Everything is great. I love the sauteed prawns with pineapple salsa and for the sides my favorites are the jalapeno creamed corn (can't get enough) and the cheddar mashed potatoes. On a previous visit I had the Pernil Asado, really awesome.  For dessert I like the Horchata bread pudding.  The place is very cozy, just a few tables inside.  I am so happy we have nice weather now, so we can sit in the patio.  Can't wait to go back.

It seems I come here every 2 to 3 years.  I am not sure why I don't keep this place in my rotation more often.  I had a great meal tonight.   Of course I was with a great girlfriend who I haven't seen in a while so the whole evening was a lot of fun.  We had a couple of cocktails, I had the Moscow Mule, I asked them to add mint to mine and they did it perfectly.  My friend had the pomegranate martini.  Both were delicious.  For our meals I had the filet mignon cobb salad and she had the seared ahi salad.  I enjoyed my salad very much, it was nicely presented and the beef was very tasty.  To end we shared a French bread pudding.  Oh my, this was sinful and delicious, worth every single calorie.

This Gelato Spot is great, not only do they have gelato, but they have food.  Yes, full menu of salads, paninis and pizzas.  I have had a few salads so far.  They were very good.  I can't wait until I am having carbs again so I can try their pizza.  The smells from the wood fire oven were amazing.

I really liked this place, I have never thought of coming here to shop, but after all I am a Mallrat, love Malls.  I know, so 90s. I had an appointment in Chandler, so I didn't know how long if would take me to get there, so I decided to leave early.  Well at that time of day and with no traffic, Chandler was not that far.  So I had about an hour and a half to kill so I headed to the mall, thank you GPS.  This place is huge, in an hour an a half I barely checked one section.  I want to go back to see what else is there.  Looks really clean and spacious.  Can't wait to be back.  I guess I need to have another blonde moment and make an appointment somewhere in Chandler.

This is going to be on my rotation for hiking.  Of course, I have to bring someone with some sense of direction around because I have none.  I would be wondering in circles for days.  There are several trails, and even though I couldn't do the whole hike since I had the twins with me, we really enjoyed it.  On our way back, I felt we took a little longer, so I am sure we went a different way.  While waiting for the group to come back, I set up my kids and their friend in the car to watch a movie.  I was prepared with plenty of drinks, but they started requesting snacks.  Yikes, I didn't think of that, because we were meeting for lunch after.  I turned around and there was a sign "Snack Bar", SCORE.  I went inside the Visitor Center and the nice lady pointed to a table with goodies.  Not much to choose, but enough for a quick snack.  I bought a few packs of Goldfish and gummy fruits.  They were very helpful and friendly.  I got back to the car and the kids were happy and quiet, ahhh good times.

Very yummy gelato.  I try to avoid it as much as possible, because my hips don't need to get any wider.I had Malaga and Creme Brulee. The Malaga flavor, similar to rum raisin was my favorite.  The hubby had chocolate rum. Very yummy, too.

Ok, I have not been very good at staying away from this place.  In the past month I have been there at least 3 times.  That is a lot for someone who is trying to avoid sweets.  Yes, yes, I am in denial.  I had pistachio when my mom came to visit.  My daddy used to love pistachio and as a child we always shared a cup.  It was really great, my mom had the Dolce Latte, that was to die for.  The sugar rush was awesome.  My twins had strawberry, of course, my little boy ends up eating half of his sister's cup.  He is an ice cream/gelato junkie.  Today, I stopped by again and had to have the Dolce Latte, YUM!

I am a bath, skin care products and make up junkie.  I really like The Body Shop products, specially when they are on sale or specials.  I am also a deal shopper, so bonus.  I really like their oil free body bronzer, at first the scent is a little strong, but it blends eventually and you are left with a nice bronzed tone.  I also love their aloe foam make up remover.  And the mascara, I like that one too.  Their face bronzer is the only one that does not make me look like an oompa loompa,  I love the orange color, but not on my face, so thank you Body Shop for having one that is perfect for me.

I am so happy this place is far away.  My clothing would not fit within a week.  We stopped by to get some cupcakes to take home.  I was supposed to take 4 cupcakes, but I must have had a weak willpower day.  I ended up with 6 cupcakes, 4 s'mores ones, a strawberry one, and an orange one.  2 nut bars, those are so yummy, worth every calorie, 2 morning glory buns, kind of a croissant/cinnamon roll fusion 2 snicker doodle cookies, a chocolate chip cookie and an oatmeal cookie.  I was trying to save the strawberry cupcake for myself, but my little boy loved it and he dropped the half I gave him, so I ended up giving him the rest of mine, the bite I had was delicious.  I also had half of the s'mores one, oh my so yummy.

After having a lovely dinner with my husband, we realized it was too early to call it a night, so we decided to hop on the light rail and go to another bar.  It was awesome.  The last time I used public transportation was in Paris a couple of years ago.  This was a lot of fun.  We can't wait to do it again.  Next time we want to go all the way to Tempe to bar hop there.

I loved this store.  I am not sure what the other reviewers were expecting, but I am glad to take the store for what it is and not what it is not.  It has an amazing variety of educational toys.  Having a child that required some OT and Speech therapy, I wish I had known about this place before.  THere are so many items I could have gotten.  I love that they have a free craft for kids 3+ every Saturday.  Of course, they know you are not going to come out empty handed.  I ended up spending about $60.00.  I used my $5 check in coupon.  Thank you, Yelp.  They were so nice.  They told me I could organize a craft day with my twin group.  Can't wait to go back.

I have not been to Vermont (the State), but these sandwich shop makes me want to visit it.  I love their sandwiches.  I am obsessed with the Rubens Place.  I also like the West Coast Wrap and the Killington.  Next time I am hoping to try something new, since so far everything has been very good.  My MO is to always buy a Rubens Place and then have my husband try something new.  That way I get to try something new but I can still enjoy at least 1/2 of my Rubens Place.

If you want your skin to look amazing, Joan is the best.  I go to different spas all over the place, always trying to get a deal, but I always end up coming back to see Joan.  She knows what she is doing and my skin looks the best after her treatments.  She has a really small spa, it is a one woman show, but I care the most about the service and products she uses on your face.  The prices are average to a little pricey but it is well worth it.  It is your face after all.

I had forgotten about this nail place.  Now that I work out at Gold's I can get my nails done afterwards.  The place is clean and the staff is friendly. Good color selection, I got Bubble Bath, one of my favorites.  As soon as I sat on the chair, the front desk guy brought me a bottle of water.   I got my pedicure about 10 days ago and it still looks good.  I will be back.

I love this place so much, a few years back one of the stores asked me to work there for the holidays.  Of course that was B.T. (Before twins).  I used to love walking around the different stores and meeting girlfriends for lunch at Zinc or North.   Also Chloe's corner used to be called the Counter.  This place is still awesome and there are still a few great stores I frequent.   The only downside is parking during Holiday Season, ugh, it is aweful.

I love Kierland Commons, it is such a fun place.  I don't mind that it is an outside mall, it has a lot of character and also a lot of my favorite shops.  I don't know how they did it, but I think this is the best one of the outside malls.  I love how they decorate it during the holidays.  It is small enough that it does not matter where you park, you can walk around the entire mall, even carrying your big shopping bags.   I am so glad this mall is only 20 minutes away, you never know when a session of retail therapy is needed.  By the way, the condos there are gorgeous, I went to a birthday party and the place was so amazing.

Love Trader Joe's.  When we were spending some time in FL, I had TJ's withdrawal.  I love their Pizza Parlanno.  It was voted one of the Best on Real Simple Magazine.  My twins love the frozen mac and cheese.  It is really cheesy.  The baked ziti is another one of their favorites.  I love their cheese selection.  There are so many things that I cannot g without.  I go there every week, prices are really great.

This is a great wine bar.  I love hanging out in the patio during our awesome fall/winter/spring.   My moms group has organized several Moms Night out at this place.  I love the monday 1/2 price deal on the wine flights and glasses, and also the Monthly 10 for $10 tasting.  Ali is very welcoming and I have always enjoyed my time chatting and catching up with friends.

The developers have done a great job at marketing this place.  Only in Scottsdale can you dig up a ditch and call it "waterfront". I am debating whether to give it a three star, because I don't want to be a hater, but this is not what I think of waterfront.  I do have a waterfront condo in FL, now that is waterfront.

I can't stop thinking about my dessert.  Even though I was not going to write reviews until I get the cast off of my right hand, I decided to go ahead and peck at the keyboard with my left hand.  The place is very cozy with a great modern vibe.  Since they don't take reservations on Fridays (we were told that) our friends and us decided to wait by the fireplace outside. Even though it took our waiter over 20 minutes to bring us our drinks, I am not going to penalize them since I was having fun chatting.  Once we got our table we ordered a fantastic meal.  I had the Salmon with red quinoa and an extra side of sweet corn polenta.  The salmon was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy.  The red quinoa was tangy with a hint of sweetness, ummm delicious. I wanted to try my husband's Forbidden Rice dish, but when I turned to get a bite, his plate was empty.  Dessert was amazing,  I had the sticky toffee pudding (second time I've had this dessert).  I is the perfect ending to  a wonderful meal.

I had been wanting to come back for a while.  I love this restaurant.  Last night we had a magnificent meal.  I started with the St. Francis Lemonade, a perfect cocktail to start your meal.  There are so many wonderful choices.  They are featuring a special menu for New Years, however you can order from it "a la carte", so we decided to start with the Arizona Citrus Salad.  It was delicious.  I love the combination of dates, goat cheese and orange slices.  I also chose from the special menu the sea scallops.  WOW, they were so sweet and tender.  They were served over a bed of black lentils, so amazing.  The portion was generous, 5 scallops, I am glad I didn't order the side of sweet corn polenta.  I ended up ordering dessert (yes my hubby twisted my arm, NOT).  I had the usual, Sticky Toffee Pudding and my hubby had the Chocolate Stout Cake.  I had a bite of his and it was great.  I cannot guarantee I won't stick to my usual dessert, but it was a closed one.  I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live.  It is such a great place.

Oh  Costco, you are the bane of my existence.  I try to get in and out just with diapers and wipes, however this has been proven impossible in the past two and a half years.  Every time I go I shudder a little.  I know I won't get out of there without a $200.00 receipt.  I love Costco, I never thought I would say those words.  I love the Baba Foods road show.  Can't have enough of the Baba Ghanouj.  This is one of the two locations I frequent, mainly because I am chasing after Baba Foods.

I love to enjoy a spa day at a resort at least once a month during the last part of summer, early fall.  This spa is pretty nice, the fitness center is nicely equipped, I loved the pilates reformer class.  The last time I went, the sauna was not working, so I didn't get to enjoy everything they offer.  Also, the wait area is not as relaxing, the chairs are a little uncomfortable. They offer teas and nuts, raising and cranberries to snack on while you wait.   I've had facials and massages done here.  My last massage was really great, I think I fell asleep at one point.  I agree with some of the reviewers that the lockers are a little cramped.  We were not busy that day, but it seems that they put everyone in the same area, so every time we wanted to open a locker, we had to wait for the other person to be done.  The infinity pool is very nice.  It is not just for the spa customers, so sometimes it gets busy and a little loud, but it is not a complaint, just an observance.

Why, Oh why, did I have to get inside this store again.  I couldn't help it.  Every time I go inside the store I remember my friend Dean's words, "you need a 12 step program, let me help you and take 12 steps out the door".  Well, I guess I didn't succeed.  I ended up with two more pairs of shoes.  They are so beautiful and comfortable.  As a rule, I cannot buy another pair until I get rid of one, but lately this rule has not been working.  I cannot part with my shoes that fast. I got a pair of suede orange sandals, they are buttery soft.  I also got a tan wedge for the summer, hey they were on sale.  Now, if they only had my size in the color block blue shoe, it was so dreamy.

I knew there was something going on.  I got an e-mail from this store saying they were having a 70% off sale.  Before Xmas???  I decided to check what was going on.  Of course, I was late.  There was only shower gels left.  Not a big fan of their shower gels, however, their Cucina products are awesome. The dish soap sets are so nice.  Thank goodness I have a stock in my pantry.  They are closing the only two stores they have in the USA.  I guess we can still shop online, however, I like instant satisfaction.  Too bad, I will miss them.

Yes, I ended up joining another gym.  Mountainside has a few things my other gym does not have.  I love several of their classes and that is a good thing because I am easily bored.  I also love that they provide you with towels, so I don't have to worry about packing them for a work out or even for showering, which makes it easier.  The gym is small, but efficient.  I am not crazy about their treadmills, but I will get over it, or use the other gym for that.  I guess I can count this one as another Groupon winner.

I love having a late lunch after a successful shopping day. I prefer to come here over the food court since it is so much more relaxing.  The service is so attentive and I can enjoy my meal and rest my tired feet for a bit.  I usually order the Cilantro Lime Chicken, light on the dressing or the Grilled shrimp and arugula salad with sweet corn.  I guess I like all my meals with a little sweetness on them. Today I felt like a grilled cheese and tomato soup. I was splurging since I have lost some weight. They don't offer that choice for adults, but how awesome are they. The let me have the kids meal, with the beverage and the side of fruit. I was in heaven.

I can say I am glad they are not anywhere near my neighborhood, otherwise I would be in trouble.  I indulge is them only every so often.  Lately I love the Strawberry cupcake and the Ginger Lemon.  I am not crazy about the chocolate marshmallow.  The prices are a little steep, but since it is not everyday, I guess it is ok.

After spending the whole morning at a lab to get some tests done, I was starving.  My husband and I decided to get some carb love.  Reading the great reviews, we headed south to Redendo's.  I had the Toni R. Calzone and my husband had the St. Anthony's Feast.  They were huge.  Lots of cheese and sausage on mine.  Really tasty and the crust had the right chewiness to my taste.  We couldn't eat them all.  We have half of each for tonight.  One thing I noticed, though, while we were there for 40 minutes more or less, my husband got 5 refills to his soda, on the other hand, I had to get up and ask for my refill. I know my husband is devastatingly handsome, but come on, give the girl a little love!

We have been wanting to check this place out for a few months now, and since we love to come to Phoenix for our date night we decided it was time to check out Switch.  We really liked it, the place, the food, the ambiance, was great.  Aaron was our server, very nice guy.  I had a glass of Malbec with my Apricot BBQ feta chicken panini, delicious and the thick potato wedges were awesome, it hit the spot.  My husband had the Jalisco Chicken Panini, another winner.  He also had the Caipirinhas, they were really good.  Next time I am having a couple of those. Can't wait to check it out for brunch.

I have been to this BJs a few times, mainly because someone else drags me. I wouldn't come on my own. Our twin group president wanted to have our last board meeting here.  She called a month ahead to let them know we would need a large area, preferably a private room.  The person she talked to assured her that they could accommodate us.  The day of the meeting, she called early in the morning to let them know we would be meeting at 6:30.  We got there at 6:25 and they were not expecting us.  They told us to wait at the bar while they set up the tables.(We were 18 twin moms, yes large board).  Well, the room was not private at all, it was just another area, divided only by half walls.  The noise level was so high, we could not hear each other.  We ordered some food, which was ok, nothing to write home about.  My Fundraising co-chair didn't get her meal until I called a waitress and made her aware of that.  Our meeting ended up being the fasted we have ever had, mainly because we could not really engage in conversation.  I guess we won't be coming back.  I think I am finally out of people who could drag me to this place.

This place is so close to my home,  and before the twins, we used to be here at least once a week.  A couple of weeks ago, we had a moms night out.  We had a wonderful time.  Service was very prompt and attentive.  As soon as we got there, they set the basket full of chips and some salsa.  Those chips are dangerous.  Not only do they have the corn type, but also the flour one (yes, in all its fried goodness).  I have to really control myself and not eat the whole basket.  If you want a lighter choice, the Margarita Ceviche is a great option.  I ordered that one last time and it was fantastic.  I also had the top shelf margarita.  It was really good, my hubby likes "the boss", but that one is a little too strong for me.  Happy hour goes until 6:30 and the deal are awesome, 1/2 price appetizers and $5 margaritas.  I should come back more often.

I used to come here a lot because they are so close to my home, however, this is not a destination for me anymore.  Last time we came here it was for my parenting group's moms night out.  The food is not very good, the service is mediocre.  Some of the margaritas are still good, but not enough for me to want to come here.  So sad!

I can't believe I have not reviewed Andreoli's before.  I have been having their sandwiches and Chocolate croissants since the twins were born.  Andreoli is so close to the Scottsdale Shea Hospital.  When I delivered the twins I had to stay there for I think 4 or 5 days.  I sent my hubby everyday for chocolate croissants and sandwiches.  Hospital food is yuck compared to it.   I went back again today, I needed some comfort food after the stress of my little girls surgery, hey I need an excuse for the carb overload.  I ordered the Porchetta and the Forza Italia, plus of course a couple of chocolate croissants, 1/3 of a pound of salami and some Zuppa inglese for an additional dessert. The food here is amazing, yes, the customer service is not the best.  They remind me of my Zio Aldo.  Always with his smug smile and always telling everyone around how "stupido" they are.  I miss him.  You need to think like George Costanza, not make any sudden moves or comments for fear you will get "No croissant for you, one year!"

This is definitely not the place I will come every again.  Service here is horrendous.  The cashier was horrible, I decided to leave my purchase and go to the Scottsdale store.  My husband was amazed I didn't snap at her, due to her language.  I told him, he cramps my style.  I have to be in my best behavior in front of him, haha.

After having a field trip with the twins in the Glendale area, we decided to check this place out since I saw the segment on Triple D.  The server was really nice.  I explained to him that I needed a cheese pizza for the twins, he offered a Margherita, I told him no basil.  If my little boy sees any green on his food he will not eat it.  Yes, it is a new phase, which shall pass.  We had the Salvatore.  The crust was delicious, perfect amount of chewiness and crispiness. The prosciutto was great.  The twins ate most of their cheese pizza, which is a bonus it did not end up on the floor.  If we are in Glendale, we will stop by again.

Wow, I have been meaning to come here for a while now.  I followed Joel L. recommendation and had the chicken souvlaki with salad, we also had falafels, hummus, tzaziki, gyro and the twins had chicken tenders.  Everything was delicious and enormous, we had so many leftovers to take home with us.  The flavor of the chicken was perfect.  I tasted a portion without any condiments or extras, just to check the flavor of the chicken and it was delicious, perfectly marinated and cooked.  Unfortunately this place is about 25 miles from my house.  I wish they were closer, I love greek  and middle eastern food.

I actually like this mall, mainly because it is a place close to my kids daycare/preschool where I can kill some time.  I know it doesn't have many high end stores, but I can relax for a few minutes.  Another bonus are the girls who are selling the flat iron, if you buy one you can get your hair done for a year, needless to say I am on that chair almost every week.

I loved this place.  I can't wait to go back.  It is such a girly place.  I think the day we went there were absolutely no men, I guess it would be a little intimidating for them, but there is nothing wrong, I think I will bring my hubby next time, haha.  We were nine women and had a fairly large table reserved for us.  We all donned hats and enjoyed the quaint place so much.  I had the Pear, Brie and Cranberry salad.  It was delicious.  We had a wonderful tea, I don't remember the name.  I am going to put this place in my rotation for birthdays or just girly time.  It is so darling.

For my second visit to Crust, I convinced my friends who are also mothers of twins to go and have our girls night.  We had an awesome time.  The pizza rustica is so delicious.  I wolfed it down so fast I didn't realize I had no left overs for my husband to take home.  We were having such a great time and a nice couple on the next table decided to buy our wine bottles. That was a really sweet gesture. I can't wait to come back.  Actually, I am going to check out their new restaurant on Tatum and Bell.  Our server mentioned it opened a couple of days ago.  That branch is closer to us and I was told Toni, the guy at the oven making the pizzas will be there.

Wow, wow, wow.  My hubby and I have been wanting to come to Breadfruit for a while.  My hubby has been to Jamaica and all over the Caribbean kiteboarding so he loves the cuisine.  We decided to have early dinner since the sitter came earlier this Saturday.  We didn't have a reservation, but that was no problem since we usually like to sit at the bar and talk to the bartenders.  Tony and Beth were so nice and efficient.  Tony just moved from Portland in  November, so we had a nice conversation with him about the area (we spend summers in OR). I had a mojito, wow, the best mojito I have had in the Valley, probably ever.  My hubby had the Caipirinha.  It was so good.  We thought we would have one appetizer and leave.  So we ordered the Scallops, then the Plantain and Avocado Spring Rolls.  They were so delicious.  The scallops were spicy, it was like fireworks in my mouth, in a good way.  I loved the sweetness of the chutney for my spring rolls.  My hubby wanted the soup of the day, the pumpkin and sweet potato soup.  I ended up eating most of it.  Since I was DD, the hubby had another drink, this time the Kingston Rum Punch, wow, that was strong but tasty.  Tony recommended the Rum Glazed Prawns and Roti Flatbread, double wow.  My hubby had a Pina Colada to wash that down. That was the best PC I've had.  Not the blended coco lopez type.   For dessert we had their bread pudding.  This was the only thing I was not that crazy about, don't get me wrong, I still ate it.  I am just used to the New Orleans type of Bread pudding, more gooey.  The experience at  Rum Bar was so great we can't wait to come back and bring friends.

Koltton is an eyebrow genius.  I read about him on InStyle magazine, yes the InStyle you are thinking about.  For the past two and a half year, I have not allowed any one to touch them, but Koltton.  I had a facial last week and the aesthetician said, "do you wax your brows".  I knew she wanted to do them, but I kindly explained to her that there is only one person who does mine.  Koltton will take up to 25 minutes to make sure they are looking their best.  This reminds me, I need to make my next appointment.

I am updating this review because I just wanted to share the info.  Koltton gave me lash extensions a few weeks ago, OMG, they were amazing.  I have had them before and they usually takes me a few days to get used to them.  Not this time.  They were light and amazing.  I showed them to several people who had done them before and they were so impressed.  He put two rows, since  I wanted them to look longer, but not full on Kardashian.  They looked so nice.

I have been wanting to come here for a long time.  After having lunch somewhere else, we wanted cupcakes.   We didn't want to go to Sprinkles since I really don't care much for them, so we called them and asked if they had cupcakes, they told us that yes and they were fresh from today.  Well, we got there 15 minutes after our call and got 2 orange, 1 chocolate caramel and one regular caramel.  After paying for them we sat at one of the tables.  I handed the twins the orange cupcakes and I got the regular caramel and hubby had the chocolate one.  I took a small bite and the cupcake was COLD, I don't know when this fresh cupcakes were made but they tasted like dense, cold dough, no caramel, I tasted the a small piece of the twins cupcakes and it was the same, flavorless dense dough.  Needless to say, I didn't finish my cupcake, neither did the twins.  If a 3 year old rejects a cupcake, that says something.  The place is very cute, but I don't think I will come back, that was a big disappointment.

I am disappointed.  I wanted to like this place.  My husband and I decided to give this place a try.  Big mistake.  What a waste of a "date night".  It was very busy, so we decided to sit at the bar.  Not a minute after we sat down one of the girls behind the bar broke a glass and shards flew in our direction.  My husband was hit in the face and even pieces of glass were in his hair.  What did this girl do?  Nothing, lifted her head and asked "did I hit you?" my response was, "I think you can see glass all over his hair and in front of him".  Under her breath she said "sorry" and turned around to take care of other people.  I asked someone else at the bar if this is the way they welcome their patrons, because I might be missing something.  Eventually one of the managers came and apologized and bought us a round of drinks.  The sushi is not great, is your typical load of mayonnaise to mask everything.  There are better places for sushi.

This is my go to Whole Foods.  The items are great, however I am deducting a star, because of some of the customer service.  When I am in a hurry and need to grab something to eat, there are many choices.  My pet peeve is the snooty old Scottsdale hags carrying their little dogs in the grocery cart and saying it is a "service dog", gross.  Don't put you damn dog where I put my food.

Even though I did the short trail, thank goodness, since it started raining and I do not do well in the rain, this was a really nice trail.  I am looking forward to trying the longer one.  Even though there is no real elevation, this is the kind of trail were you can go with a friend and leisurely chat your way through it.  I have a friend in mind already.  The only thing to watch out for is all the loose gravel.  I almost twisted my ankle a couple of times.

I enjoy this place.  I usually go at night with a group of moms and we love it.  The food is very good.  I finally tasted the Evil Jungle Princess Beef that my friend raved about.  It was really delicious.  I love the Black Orchid Ahi Tuna. I went for lunch with my husband and we had a great time.  The bartender, Paul is great.  My husband's house margarita was really good.  The prices are so reasonable.  I can't wait for my next moms night out.

This is a wonderful place to have lunch with your girlfriends.  My girlfriends took me to lunch there for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  The place was packed, we were actually surprised to see many gentlemen having lunch too, however it was not surprising because the food is great.  I had the special, salad, tomato soup and grilled cheese with chutney, yummy.  We washed everything down with Sangrias, so good!

I am a gym rat.  I go to the gym every day for 1 1/2 to two hours.  I started hiking this trail regularly about 7 weeks ago.  It is not horrible, but it is not as easy.  Those switchbacks are killers.  The only thing that keeps me going is my mantra, when I am doing those damn steps.  I love that it is not a loop and if you are hiking with a group, people can hike at their own pace and what they can do.  The views are really pretty, but I am probably partial since I live practically around the corner.  I am glad I started this routine, but I am sure I won't keep it during the summer.

I love finding deals.  I am a shopper after all.  I like that this store is always full of great offers for a lot of items.  I love to wear dresses and it is so easy to find a few at great prices.  I ended up buying 4 dresses last week.  They were so cute.  Customer service has always been pleasant.  Maybe because they see me there a lot, and by a lot I mean at least once a week.   Now that the twins are a little older, it seems I get more free time for one of my favorite hobbies.  Yikes, I don't think my hubby is going to like it.

Yes, the previous reviewers are right, not an authentic indian, however it is a very good place.  We really enjoyed the paratha naan and the lentil tower.  I had the salmon and it was nicely seasoned.  Chris was very nice to let us try the other sauces.  I am a sauce person so I loved the tamarid sauce that comes with the paratha naan and the somosas.  We would be here every other day if it wasn't because it is a little bit too far for us.

This is an outdoors person's heaven.  That is not me, but I can appreciate it.  I came here because they had a killer deal on Keen shoes for the kids.  We love those shoes, but paying $50 a piece can bite, so when they were 50% off, I got 2 pairs for each kid.

What do they fill the windshield washer bucket with? Swamp water? Port-a-potty "juice"? I'm all for recycling but this was so disgusting.  My husband spilled one drop on his shoe, and even though he wiped it immediately with some baby wipes we had in the car, it didn't matter.  As we drove away from the gas station I was noticing the skunk scent, I couldn't stand the smell.  I made him turn around and go to the grocery store bathroom to wash his shoe.  YUK!  Those shoes are going in the dumpster.

What an awesome experience!  My friend suggested we do a double date and booked a cooking class.  On Fridays the cooking class offers beer and wine, bonus! The chef Joe Cambria was very knowledgeable and patient.  He explained each course we were preparing as a team.  There were about 14 couples.  We had to prepare an appetizer, a salad, an entree and a dessert.  For the appetizer we made  phyllo dough brie and pear beggars purse,  I decided this is the station I felt I could shine and I also took a couple of bites of the extra pieces of brie cheese available.  Our salad was a ceasar's salad and the main dish was flank steak which was delicious.  I couldn't believe that we would be able to put this together so fast.  The session started at 6:30p.m. and the chef was explaining each station and the process before we were divided into teams.  By the time he was done with the lessons it was well after 7:30p.m.  I was being a doubting Thomas and was not sure we would be eating before 9. Well, once the teams are divided, everyone goes to work on their area.  The meal came together pretty fast and delicious, I was impressed. Our dessert was creme brûlée, which is one of my favorite desserts.  I could have had three of those. By the way, they do provide an apron for everyone as well as the recipes of the dishes prepared.  I think this should be a regular rotation for date night.

I have been coming to this place for over 4 years.  I always ordered either Pad Thai or the Basil Chicken without even looking at the menu.   I was always satisfied with these choices until I decided to read the menu since I was craving curry. OMG I have been missing the most awesome yellow curry, the creamy coconut sauce, the potatoes, yum.  I am hooked.  I can't wait to have this again.

Not worth the money.  I was a member for a few years. nothing special.  Lots of attitude and douches.  Better spend my money somewhere else. I had been a member since 07, due to pregnancy complications I cancelled it for a while and restarted after the twins were born.  Around April 09, I spoke with Andy, one of the Managers about my membership.  He also told me about the daycare.  I had a nanny at home so I didn't need to use their daycare.  He said he would just put the names of the babies in the computer just in case one day I would decide to use it, so it won't take time.  He told me I wouldn't be charge for it.  I said fine.  I didn't notice until a year and a half later that  they had been charging me for this all along.  I call Andy to let him know about it.  He used to be very receptive and always answer to my messages.  Unfortunately, he had been promoted to Regional Manager or something, so he is always traveling.  He didn't call back, so after a week I talk to another guy, I think his name was Derek.  I explained the situation and he said he would take care of it.  I thought it was corrected.  Well to my surprise I was charged the following month again.  I talked to Derek and he informed me that there is a 30 day notice for cancellations and that I could use the daycare until the end of that month.  I was outraged, he didn't listen.  I told him, I was not supposed to be charged on the first place and that I have never and will never use the daycare.  I had a full time nanny for my twins, so I didn't need that service.  Again, he left me a voice mail saying I could use the daycare until the end of the month.  Well, I don't need to go to that gym.  I cancelled my membership the following month.

I haven't been here in a while.  I like how they have remodeled this Fry's, even though it is not even 5 years old, they revamped it a little.  Today they had awesome deals for certain participating items.  I am glad I read the flyer I got in the mail.  I am glad I have their VIP card, I got a lot of stuff for only $45.

I bought one of those one deal offers for a "cactus body wrap".  I didn't know what to expect, the place is a little far away from where I live, but for the price I decided to get it.  Noel did my wrap, she was really sweet and professional.  I loved the wrap.  I saw several signs that said they would give you a complementary make up touch up.  I was excited about it because I had not done my makeup (I had a migraine earlier) and I had to go pick up my kids from preschool.  Noel said "oh yes, Zethina will touch up your make up".  That was my only disappointment.  When I was ready to get my touch up, Zethina was busy fixing shelves.  Noel was nice enough to put some concealer and mascara.

This is the only massage place I will go from now on.  I love the massages by Steve Ibach, he knows what he is doing.  My old body has so many aches and pains and he focuses on whatever is ailing you.  The place is small, however it is very cozy and you feel at home.

I love this place.  It caters to my OCD.  I like to have things in places where I can find them.  My hubby is always amazed, whatever he is looking for in our home, if he asks me, I know exactly where it is.  I am now organizing the twins bedroom, they have tons of stuff that need to be contained.

This is a great find.  I have had some take out before and it was always pretty good.  My husband loves this place, so every time he is in the area, he offers to bring some dinner home.  I had a fajita burrito a couple of times.  They travel well.  About a week ago, we were in the area and it was dinner time.  He convinced me to come here.  I am glad, we had a good time.  We ordered steak fajitas and shrimp fajitas so we could sample both.  We also had the chips and salsa.  The food was fresh tasting and very flavorful.  The portions are very generous.  I will definitely come back again.

I loved this place.  I was a little hesitant about the concept, but I had a great time. My mom and older daughter were visiting from out of town.  My mom usually doesn't have dinner out because she eats so little. So when my daughter was visiting from LA we told her we were going there and that she didn't need to eat all, just whatever she wanted.  Well, let me tell you, grandma ate everything that was put in front of her,  even had the frog legs Chris served us as our starter. My daughter works production on TV in LA and she commented to Chris that he should be on Top Chef.  Can't wait to be back for another experience.

Kevin is freaking amazing.  We called him after we returned from our vacation.  He did troubleshoot over the phone, but I still wanted him to come by.  He is so reliable, honest and thorough.  The only thing we needed was some freon or it equivalent now a days.  Very reasonable price and trustworthy.  I added his number to my contact list on my phone.  I am glad I have someone who can take care of my A/C in the future.

I love this teas.  Yes, they are an indulgence.  At $25 a small bag, they are freaking expensive.  However, I got a couple of little bags on New Years day sale, so it was $20 for 2 small bags of tea.  The minimum you can buy is 2 oz.  My hubby was teasing me that you can probably get pot cheaper than that.  But what can you do, I love tea and never care for pot.  They sales people here are great at the up sale.  On word of caution, be clear with the sale information.  When they gave us the sample, they said: "Oh, and this tea is at 75% off"  I thought score, but since it is a blend of two teas, the other one is not so once you go to get your bag, they tell you it comes up to around 40% off.  I did buy them because those two are my favorite ones and they usually don't have other great sales during the year.  At least I didn't spend $250 in teas like my girlfriend.

We have come here for mom's night out a few times and they did a fantastic job for our Parenting Group's holiday party.  The food is solid, I liked their sushi rolls.  My husband likes their flatbreads.  The salads were very good.  For our holiday party, we had the back patio all to ourselves.  It was really nice to have that area to enjoy with our friends and be able to mingle and have our white elephant gift exchange.  It was our most successful party yet.

My husband and I had our weekly date night.  Mamma needed to get her drink! We decided to venture back to Phoenix since there are so many new places we wanted to try. Even though it was fairly empty, this place looks like it gets busy later at night.  I loved my Lectric Lemonade, great way to start the night.  I loved the decor, and the setting above a Starbucks.  Very hip.  The only thing I would suggest to the owners is to reprint their Happy Hour cards, it said HH goes from Mon- Sat.  Bartender said is only Mon-Fri.  I was not going to let that spoil my night and I really liked the place.  I will be back!

It was around dinner time on a Sunday (when you have little ones dinner is early).  We starting driving south but twin wanted spaghetti and meatballs.  I yelped and this place is about 8 miles from my house.  So we turned around and headed to Babbo's .  The big test is if the twins eat.  I am glad to say the extra star is for my little ones happy face.  My little boy specially ate all his spaghetti and meatballs.  He actually had some from his sister too.  The servings are very large.  I split one order between them.  My hubby had the Sicilian Ragu and he enjoyed it very much.  I had the Pasta Rustica with linguini.  They are very accommodating.  I didn't feel like having penne and requested the change and they didn't bat an eye.  I think they have the basic marinara for most of the dishes and they add a few ingredients to the different pasta dishes.  Like mine seemed to be the marinara with ricotta and some fresh spinach which is great, however, when you add ricotta it makes the sauce a little blander so you need to spice it up a little.  No big deal.  I added some red pepper flakes.  The place is spacious and looks clean.  I will definitely come back with the twins.  I am glad I have somewhere nearby where I can enjoy a glass of wine with dinner.  This was one of the least stressful dinners with the twins.  I know, I paint them worse than what they are.

My baby boy is going to flip when I bring him to this store.  I didn't know they had a Lego Store at the Chandler Fashion Center, so imagine my surprise when I turned the corner and there it was, building block heaven.  I ended up buying a couple more cars.  My little boy is crazy about building different cars and airplanes with the Legos.  Can't wait to bring him here.

We decided to check this place out after reading some of the reviews.  I guess I am disappointed because I had such high expectations.  This is just a regular coffee shop.  I was there with my husband and one of my twins.  I was going to order the breakfast burrito, but I wanted it with turkey sausage.  The girl at the counter told me they couldn't do it.  Ok, so I chose the Turkey sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin.  I requested a scrambled egg for my little girl, again the girl at the counter told me they couldn't do that.  The eggs come pre-made in the shape of a patty, that sounded as appetizing as my sneakers after a 3 mile run.  I decided to cancel the food and pay for the coffee and bottled OJ I got for my baby.  Too bad, I am always looking for breakfast places.

The best part of Mbar is their new bartender.  We went there to see Michael.  He used to be our bartender at Tommy Vs.  He is so awesome.  Super personable and will make sure you enjoy your drink.  I had a wonderful zinfandel he recommended and the hubby had his typical Margarita on the rocks with salt.  The place is very nice, a little pricey, but it is what you can expect from a nice resort after all.

This place is dangerous, I find a lot of excuses to drive 20 something miles away.  My Physical therapy is in the Desert Ridge area, so that makes is only 10 miles away, practically next door.  I have been indulging a little bit too much on the maple donuts, my favorite, they are pillowy soft and the frosting is perfectly creamy.  On Tuesdays, they have the orange cake donut, my little boy's favorite.  Good thing I have PT Tuesdays and Thursdays, maybe not?!?!?

Had a great time last night with my girlfriends.  You cannot beat the Monday deal.  I had my delicious bruschettas,   love the tomato jam one.  Also the prosciutto and fig, YUM.  I am back to salads for a few days.  It was well worth it.  I still like the Arcadia location better,  Central was really loud, so it was harder to talk to everyone when you have a large table.  I still loved it  anyways.  Can't wait to be back.

I love these guys, they are so helpful.  I usually don't need shoe repair, my hubby thinks I am trying to achieve an Imelda Marcos kind of shoe collection.  Yes, I love shoes.  I bought a pair of boots that were slightly damaged and I took it to them to get a quote for repair.  They are so honest, he told me how much the repair would be, so I decided to just return the boots and bought the same ones online for a little bit more, but it was still less than what the boots would have been with the repair. I sometimes buy shoes that are a little big, hey when there is a sale, I have gone there and gotten stuff to make them fit.  A little heel cushion and voila, the shoe fits.  I take even the twins toys for repair.  We had this baby doll strollers that had ripped seams.  The twins decided the strollers were for their use, so of course they ripped.  The guys repaired them masterfully.  My hubby also takes sports gear and bags to be fixed.  And the best is how nice they are.  I yo-yo a little bit with my weight, so every time I need an extra hole on my belt, they do it on the spot and they don't even charge me for that.  How sweet is that.

I have been to this location a handful of times.  I am trying to avoid Pima as much as possible since they started construction.  I don't mind paying a little more for special items once in a while, but you expect better service with that.  I was waiting at the "Boulangerie" to get my ice tea, I was there for a good 5 minutes making eye contact with the woman packing some pastries.  No acknowledgment, no greeting, no "I'll be with you in a minute".  I was about to leave when someone else came to take care of me.  I guess I will keep avoiding this stretch of Pima

I think I am being generous here.  The place is cute, but I agree with Sari,  the other 3 star reviewer.  Service very slow.  Maybe it was because I had a Doozy deal.  My facial was less than ok.  It started 15 later than my scheduled time, however we ended before 45 minutes were over.  Cathy was my aesthetician and I was not happy with her job.  A very hurried cleansing, then she blobbed an enzyme mask while I got the steam.  The steam was longer than usual.  After that she removed the mask with a very hot towel. after that she put some cream and then she noticed I had "raccoon eyes" so she clean the mascara off and I was on my way.  I know I am not coming back to this place.  I get facials every three weeks.  If you want a great experience, Joan Julian is awesome, a little far since she is in Cave Creek.

I don't know if it was the company or what.  After reading the reviews I was a little skeptical, but I wanted to try it, and since my husband was not interested in checking this place out,  I went with two of my favorite girlfriends.  I ordered the Pasta alla Vodka, and I did like it, A LOT.  The soft ricotta purses, were so yummy, specially if you ate it with a morsel of the crispy pancetta.  Our server was very nice, I think his name was Edward.  They were very attentive to our needs. The place is like a better Maggiano's IMHO.  The prices are very reasonable and we had a great time, we were there for two hours.

I usually don't visit steakhouses, no, I am not a vegetarian, I just don't eat beef very often.  I came here for a birthday and it was also Restaurant Week.  The menu for restaurant week was delicious, I liked it even better than the regular one.  We started with a cocktail, I wanted a Moscow Mule, I think they just started making them, because our server had to go check if they could make it.  It was good, not as awesome as other ones I have had.  The bread is made in house, so even though I try to avoid breads, I had to try it, twice.  It was so carbtastically delicious.   I started with the shrimp cocktail, wow, the cocktail sauce had a lot of horseradish, really spicy, but I could handle it.  For my entree, I had the salmon, it was cooked to perfection and for dessert I had the Tres Leches, I had to really had a lot of self control to not finish every bite.  I took half of the cake for my hubby.  I think I need to come back for another experience, it is a great place.

This is such a great place.  I can't believe I have not written a review for it.  I've been coming here since it opened.  I've been here a few times with my hubby and a couple of times we have organized our twin moms night out.  I love their roasted beet salad. It is perfect.  I love beets, but I don't want to take the time to prepare them, so whenever I see that item on the menu, I order it.  I was very happy with this salad.  The first time I went, I was a little hesitant to order the yukon gold pizza.  I had read about it, but I have never had potato on a pizza.  Well, it is awesome.  carbs on top of carbs, how can you go wrong.  The best part is that they slice the potatoes so thin it is perfect.  It makes it light.  The crust is thin but has great chewiness.  Another time I had the Spicy Seafood linguini.  It was great, the portion was very generous, it was a good thing I was splitting it with a girlfriend. For dessert we split the Zeppole, which are like little donut holes, yummy, how can you not like fried dough.

Thank you fellow yelpers, this place is fantastic.  I have been wanting to come and check it out for a while.  This place is definitely worth the 52 mile round trip drive.  I had the carne asada burrito.  I had read so much about it I was salivating while my order was getting ready.  My hubby had one carne asada taco and one barbacoa.  Both were delicious, too.  We also ordered the guacamole, excellent.  This place is a little gem.  Can't wait co come back, I will try the fish platter another diner was having, it looked really good.

While my hairdresser was on maternity leave, I needed to get my roots and highlights done. OMG, I should have put a baseball cap for six weeks and waited for Alisa to come back.  I called the salon and explained to them that I had my hair color formula, so they quoted me the price 55 for the base and $75 for the partial highlight, with a junior stylist.  A little steep, but I thought well, it is going to be one time and I have the formula, so this is a no brainer, they cannot mess the color up.  What a mistake.  What this place has going on is the hip atmosphere to attract people.  Service is mediocre at best.  I was talking to the girl who was doing my hair to gage her level of competence.  Not impressive but, color is color.  After my color was done, it didn't come out exactly as usual, I am not sure if she couldn't follow directions or what, the formula is like a recipe, x oz of this, y oz of that. Ok, I just wanted to be on my way so I told her to blow it out straight.  I had wavy hair before I had my keratin treatment done.  My hair do looked frizzy at the end, a sign of someone who had not done may blow outs.  I do a better job at home.  When it came time to pay, they told me my bill was $175.  What??? I told them I was quoted $130.  Well they told me my girl was a level two so she charges 65 for the base.  So I said well that would be $140 then.  She then said, well blowing your hair out is an extra $35.  I couldn't believe it.  Every salon I have been to includes the blow out or style with their color. I had to go home wash my hair and redo the blow out.  Next time my hairdresser has a baby, I will put a cap on and wait.

Love this place, I didn't know about them until a former yelper recommended them to me.  I can even take my twins items now.  Most of my twins stuff is brand new, the stinkers grow up so fast.  Last week I took coats and shoes that were never worn, still in the bags and tags.  I also was able to get a few costumes for the twins.  Great place.

I have been to Puerto Rico a couple of times and I lived in Ecuador while I was a lot younger, so I crave plantains more often than my hips want to know.  My husband and I decided to check this place out.  It is solid, I had the pernil (roast pork), which was really good, very well seasoned and of course I had to have "tostones" and "maduros".  Same plantain, one ripe the other green.  I have a weakness for them.  My husband had the shrimp al mojo with the arroz con gandules.  I had a taste and it was very good.  I want to come back to taste the mofongo.  This is a place where you go to get home cooked style food.  I am glad we checked this place out.

By far my favorite Fro-Yo place. I love that they have more selection, especially my fave, pistachio, YUM.  Will drive 40 miles round trip for it. They are really friendly and generous with their samples, they actually hand you the sample cups. The place is very clean, the toppings bar is always well stocked and the heath bar pieces are the right size (I like them really small), so I can sprinkle it over yogurt.  Then top it all with ooey gooey caramel, HEAVEN! On top of all the goodness they are about 12 cents cheaper per ounce.  Can't beat that.  I am always finding an excuse to drive down and make a pit stop.

The dessert area is very dangerous to my waistline.  The slice of chocolate cake is enormous.  We used to get it plus a couple of other desserts and watch "The biggest Loser".  Good thing  I don't watch that show anymore.  I love their teas.  This location is close to my house so I can stop a few times.  The service is great here.

My hubby and I went to the UYE set up by Liz S. last Sunday.  We had a really great time.  The buffet was very good.  I am a fan of yellow curry.  I wish it was not Tofu, though.  I had a taste of everything.  The only thing I skipped was the donut hole thingys.  I am being adventurous with beers also, so I asked them to suggest one, I had the Chang.  It was perfect with my meal.  This is such a reasonable place, you can enjoy your meal, watch the game, yes, they had the game on tv, have a beer and relax.  The buffet was only $9.50.  Thanks Liz, for setting this up, we got to experience a great place.

This is usually my go to Safeway.  I cannot say it is closest to my house because I have 3 Safeways the same distance from my home, 5.6 miles.  However, I think I like this one because it is easy to find parking and I already know the layout by heart and can get in and out in 20 minutes.

This is such a cool place.  I had to come back to get the full experience.  The retro/hawaiian feel was awesome and they were playing Forbidden Planet on the big screen, so my hubby was in geek heaven.  Drinks are great.  I had the Pink Bikini Martini and my husband the Zombie.  Wow, the Zombie is for serious drinkers, it is super strong.  I guess we are a little bit out of practice.  We'll be back for some more fun.

This is my new favorite breakfast place, and my twins not only behaved but they ate very well.  It was awesome to see them eat almost all their food.  I shared 1/2 a portion of the caramelized bananas and pecans brioche french toast with the hubby and had the egg whites asparagus omelet with home fries.  My hubby like my home fries better than his hash browns.  I am sure we will be back soon, there is so much we want to try.

What a cute boutique.  I have been going to Kierland for so many years and I never went inside this place.  I was there last Friday visiting the store next door and decided to check it out.  Lately, I have been on a hunt for big earrings.  I found 2 pairs that were really nice.  Prices are very reasonable.  They have a variety of items.  If it wasn't because I was meeting a friend, I would have checked out more items.  They had a great sale on outerwear items.

I am not sure if I went on an off day or what.  My omelet was less than mediocre.  My in-laws had sandwiches that came in regular sliced white sandwich bread, yuck! My husband had another omelet and he didn't finished his either.  My friend keeps asking me to go there with her, but I am too traumatized.

I really like this place.  It is a little bit of an expensive addiction.  Every time I am in Old Town I end up getting 3 or 4 more bottles.  The place is so inviting.  I love the Pear Cinnamon balsamic vinegar.  You can mix it with a little olive oil and salt and pepper and have a fast, delicious dressing.  I just opened the Sage and Mushroom olive oil. The earthy flavor is a great topping for my risotto. I wish I had seen the Groupon I would have gone even crazier!

Finally, I was in the neighborhood and Jon H. suggested we come here for dessert.  Thank you, although I am not sure how often I can drive 30 miles each way for frozen yogurt.  The place is very nice.  Typical self serve place, you have to ask for sample cups, but they seem very friendly about it.  I was so lucky, they had Pistachio!!!!  And their pistachio was amazing, I have had my share of fro-yo pistachio and this had definitely the best flavor.  The toppings are very similar to other places, but Jon pointed out the fresh raspberry sauce, so I had to try it.   Yes this is a place that I need to come back, hopefully they will have pistachio again.

I was very impressed with this little spa.  I was  not expecting much, since I had a Living social deal and so far I have not been thrilled with some of the other spas.  However after a recommendation by a former yelper, Pamela B. , I made an appointment for a facial with Samantha.  She was great.  I can't wait to come back.  I also have a Groupon for the same place.

After a night of drinking and partying we came to the right place for brunch.  This is a ode to excess.  My husband and I decided to order two dishes and split them.  Well one would have been more than enough.  Don't get me wrong, the food was so delicious, but there was so much, I think we could have fed a small family.  We had Andy's sage fried chicken benedict and one brown sugar banana pancake.  The pancake was the size of big frisbee.  It was HUGE!!! Of course I had to have a mimosa, you know, hair of the dog, is that the saying???  We ended up leaving half of our meals, not because they were not delicious, but we were stuffed.  The fried chicken benedict was great, huge portion of fried chicken cooked to perfection.  I had this meal around noon and I didn't eat again until the next day.  Next time I am in Las Vegas, I will stop by here, there are still so many items I want to try.

I am going to pay for this meal, but I don't care.  I will run a few extra miles because it was so worth it.  My shawarma chicken was to die for.  The chicken was marinated to perfection.  I also had a side of baba ganoush, omg, so delicious. I also ended up eating half of my hubby's lentil soup.   I wish I had enough space for the spanakopita.  I had the baklava "to go" for later.  It didn't even make it to I 17.  It was freaking delicious, the honey and pistachios were so prevalent in the taste.  I am still dreaming about it.  I also shopped for a few items at the market.  What a cool place.  Can't wait to take the hike back to the west side.

This is a great spot for North Scottsdale.  There is nothing more than $10.  The taco trio is really good.  Comes with rice and beans.  I always have at least one mahi mahi.  Love it.  I also like the Mahi platter is I want a little less carbs.  Antonio is awesome he makes great margaritas which are really a deal.   Their happy hour is one of the more generous in town, it is until 8pm.  Another great thing is that they are open late.  Everything around our neighborhood closes around 9pm.

This is my new favorite Coffee Bean.  I have been meeting a girlfriend a few times here to catch up.  The place is very nice and has a lot of comfortable seating.  The employees are friendly and I can get my favorite tea anytime.  They also have a drive thru, I didn't know Coffee Bean had one.

I had my twins here, and ten days later I almost died here.   I am not sure if I would go back.  I am trying to figure out what I would do next time I am driven by ambulance to an ER. At least I know I won't bring my twins here, I recently discovered a great ER for children.

I got a Doozy of a Deal a few months ago for a Keratin Smoothing Treatment.  I was a little nervous because the last time I had it done, it didn't turn out as well as the previous time.  I didn't know what to expect since I was buying it with a coupon (DoaD).  I was so pleasantly surprised.  Jane did a fantastic job.  She knew exactly what she was doing.  She was so gracious with all my questioning.  My hair is smooth and healthy.  I am definitely recommending her to my friends.

I think this is my new place for pedicures.  It is so much closer to my house and they are very efficient.  I like that there is no wait at all.  I have been here three times and it seems like my leg massage a little longer.   Not sure if it is because there is no one in the queue after me or if it is because I am a regular now.   The place is clean and quiet, which I appreciate.  I am so glad I can drive there in about 10 minutes.  Great find.

I never thought I would get a brazilian.  My worst fear was the pain.  Well, I am not going to lie, it is not painless, but it is tolerable.  I try to take a couple of ibuprofen before I go.  Emma and Rachel are wonderful.  They make you feel at ease while you are spread eagle on the table.  The wax they use is not as hot and I love how sanitary it is.  No double dipping on the wax.

Finally, I made it back here after a first failed attempt over 8 years ago.  I love, love their happy hour deals, although I had the Lavender Lemon Drop, which was delicious.  The sliders, tacos and brie platter are awesome at just $3 a pop.  I think the margaritas are also $3.  I can't wait to come back and bring my in-laws, I know they will love the setting and ambiance.  Such a beautiful place.

We love this place.  We tried another children's hair salon a few months back and it was a horrible experience, not "kool" at all.  By the recommendation of a friend I took my twins to Snip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah.  It was such a great experience, both my twins have gotten hair cuts a couple of times as well as my husband.  Miss Tara is really great with the kids, there is no more stress to go to get hair cuts!

I had an appointment in Old Town and I was hungry, so I wanted a place that would be fast enough without resorting to fast food.  I remembered this little place next to Daily Dose, so I decided to check it out.  The ladies working there were very nice and welcoming.  I had the Southwest Chicken Sandwich.  It was very tasty and had a bit of a kick.  I can't wait to taste the crepes.

I loved this spa.  It is so close to my house I could walk to it.  Whenever I have a service at one of the resort spas, I take advantage of all the amenities.  I get there as early as possible, start at the fitness center, then enjoy the pool and have my service at the end of the day.  I usually do facials, so I don't want to go back to the pool and dry or remove the nice products they put on my face.   This spa is very serene and unlike other resort spas, they do not have a spa pool area.  You have access to the regular pool, which is fine with me.  The property is beautiful and you can walk around and enjoy the surroundings.  I can't wait to come back for another relaxing day.

When it open a few years back, I was so excited to have this place near my home.  I went a couple of times back then and haven't been back until this past Friday.  I had a mom's night out from the other parenting group I belong to, so I decided to just go and catch up with the ladies I have not seen in a while.  Our server was ok, not very attentive, or perceptive.  I ordered a glass of Prosecco and the spicy shrimp appetizer.  The shrimp was really spicy and not in a really good way.  More like just hot sauce spicy, good  thing I had the Prosecco and a glass of water, however once my water was gone, the glass sat empty for the rest of the night.  I am glad I don't have to come back.

My girlfriend treated me to dinner and she suggested to come here.  I was a little weary, however, I wanted to give them another chance.  I haven't been here in over 4 years.  I am not sure if they are the same owners or if there is another chef, but our meals were really good.  I had the scallops over mashed sweet potatoes, who doesn't love sweet potatoes.  The scallops were sweet and tender.  Delicious.  My friend ordered the halibut over forbidden rice.  I had a bite of the forbidden rice, very tasty.  I need to come again and check some other dishes.

I loved this place.  I can't wait to come back and bring some girlfriends.  This place is so different, I told my husband this is what I imagine a bar in Alabama might look like, kind of Hillbilly cool without the banjos.   LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it.  The drinks are amazing.  I had a couple of the mojitos and they were delicious.  The drinks are made with fresh squeezed juices and you can taste it. My hubby had the Duce Margarita and he said it was fantastic.  We ate a selection of the sliders.  My favorites in order were the egg, brisket, cheese, meatball, chicken sausage.  I also had the sweet potato crisps.  Yummy sweet potato chips, Andy the owner told me they baked them not fried, bonus.  Music is loud, and the ambiance is so much fun.  Andy is so nice and friendly, can't wait to share this experience again.

I didn't know that they allow smoking inside the casino.  I was grossed out when I went in to meet my girlfriends at Orange Sky restaurant.  I cannot agree more, this place smells like a dirty ashtray.  Too bad, because maybe I would have like to spend some time at the tables.

My twin moms friends were staying for the weekend at the resort, and since they didn't want to drive for dinner, they decided to dine at Orange Sky.  This review was going to be a 2 star, but after my horrible night, it definitely is a one.  It is not only that the prices are high, but the food is nothing special.  I like to eat and I couldn't find anything I really wanted.  I decided to order the beet salad, it was ok, but I had great ones in so many other places.  I should have stopped there and call it the night.  But since some of my girlfriends were ordering the Restaurant week menu, we had some more time to kill.  I asked to the Artichoke potato au gratin.  Big mistake.  It is really big size and I am glad I only ate half of it.  After that I felt I had a brick in my stomach.  I left my girlfriends around 10p.m. and I went home.  I couldn't sleep, I was so uncomfortable, and nauseous. Stop here if you don't want to be grossed out.  By 3:30 I couldn't take it and I was kneeling in front of my toilet.  It all came out undigested.  I was glad, but my throat was in pain.  Yuk! By the way I only had two glasses of wine.

After reading Dante M.'s review (we think he has a discerning culinary taste), my husband and I decided to stop by Centurion.  It is a very cool place, small and cozy.  Being a cheese lover, I had to try the Baked Brie, yummy gooey goodness.  We also had the Shitaki gnocchi.  It was very good.  We can't wait to come back with friends.

Even though the Pima location is still my favorite.  I had a great time here, too.  After playing in the park with the twins, it was an easy decision to just go across the street and have an early lunch.  My kids love the meatballs, and I liked my turkey ruben very much.  I still wish they would have the long booths as they do at the Pima location.

After reading Bill's review, I was intrigued.  I had been a fan of Zest for a long time.  Tonight we were at the parking lot of the restaurant we were supposed to have dinner.  After reading his review, my husband and I decided to turn around and try Gasper's.  I am glad we did.  We had a great time.  We decided to sit at the bar, since we used to do so when it was Zest.  Maryam was very nice.  My husband had a margarita and I started with the St. Francis zinfandel. Such a yummy wine.  We ordered our calzone with mushrooms, arugula, eggplant and prosciutto.  That was a great choice.  Lacey's review mentioned the mushroom papardelle, so I decided to give it a try.  Another great choice, it reminded me of the times my dad and I used to make pasta on Sundays.  We had the tiramisu for dessert, I couldn't pass that up.  I don't remember the name of the magician, but he was very entertaining.  We are definitely coming back with friends for another great experience. Of course I will have to go on a diet for a couple of days before coming back.

OMG, I can't believe we were so lucky to be seated at the chef's tasting bar, even though we were eating from the regular menu.  The good stars were out,  the couple that was supposed to have those two seats, cancelled last minute.  Chef Fukada was very charming.  The couple he was preparing the food for, were very gracious.  The chef explained what he was making for this couple.  The dishes were like a work of art.  It was an experience.  We ordered the grapefruit hamachi, my husband would say I inhaled it.  It was so delicious, the texture and flavor combination was amazing.  The curry lamb was very good too, even though I usually don't eat lamb, I ended up eating half of this dish, so we had to order another item.  Last we had the soft shell panini, I loved this ones.  Anything with bread makes my day! Yes this place is a little pricey, but you should consider it for a special occasion.  I think it is worth it.

I am obsessed with this "paletas".  I am finding every excuse to drive 36 miles to the Chandler store.  I have been there twice and I will be going tomorrow.  The first time I was lucky enough to meet the "Betty" of Paletas Betty.  She is a cute, tiny little thing.  So charming.  She was so nice and accommodating.  I had my soft side cooler with me, hey, I have twins, you cannot imagine what I carry in my cars.  Armed with my cooler, I got a dozen paletas the first time.  I tasted Pineapple con Chili, so special.  Great pineapple flavor with a great kick from the red pepper chili flakes.  The Naranja, Orange was delicious I only had a small bite since the twins wouldn't share.  My hubby had the Cookies and Cream one, another one who wouldn't share.  The Cereza (Cherry) was awesome.  I really liked the vanilla based ice cream with big cherries all over.  Then, the piece de resistance, the Limon, it is like biting into a frozen piece of key lime pie, one side of the paleta has the graham cracker crust.  So delicious.  I had two, plus all the other ones. My second trip I got another dozen, of course I had a few Limon, plus Strawberry, Oh this is like fresh strawberries and creme.  Those two are my favorite.  I also tried the Zarzamora, a blackberry/lavender concoction, very refreshing.  The "Platano" is very good.  It is like biting into a frozen caramelized banana.  Can't wait for my next trip to Paletas Betty.  I already placed my cooler back in the car.  Yay!

Yes, the kitchen during Restaurant Week was a mess.  I am pretty mellow about waiting for food, but my friends were getting pretty upset.  We waited almost 2 hours for our meal. With that said, I give them a 4 star because the food was great, and my review is focusing on food.  I enjoyed the gambas al Pil Pil, garlicky shrimp, yum. My friend's Paella Valenciana was excellent.  The only other paella I would prefer is the one in Madrid from La Barraca.  My husband had the Arroz Negre (black rice with squid ink). I also had the salmon, delicious. For desert I had the Crema Catalana, spanish creme brule, creamy custard with a great sugar crust.  We will try them again to see if the kitchen works better next time.

I was pleasantly surprised.  I had not been back to the former Kashman's because I didn't care for it before.  I think the service and food is much better now.  We went there with the twins and requested a couple of scramble eggs for them to be done first.  They did so and were very accommodating.  I had the pancakes, remember to request the real maple syrup. They were delicious, and an huge portion, I shared some with the twins and my husband and still couldn't finish it.  My husband had the breakfast burrito, it was very good.  He ask to add potato to it and they did so.  The pastries look so good, we'll have to try them next time. We will certainly be back soon.

I liked this place.  It has been in my bookmarks forever.  Our bartender, I think her name was Rachel, was really nice.  My hubby had "the best Margarita".  I think it is because it was so strong.  I saw how much buzz she poured and I told him we need a DD.  She made me a couple of martinis based on ingredients I told her I liked.  They were both great.  We also had the white bean hummus with the pretzel bread and veggies.  It was really good.  I can't wait to come back and try other things.

Ugh, we were so excited to try this new location.  We went today for happy hour.  The food was awful, I bit into a taquito and I got a mouthful of greasy beef chunk.  I had to spit it out and put it to the side.  I couldn't take another bite.  The guacamole looked and tasted like out of a bag.  Even the premium margarita was not good.  I was so disappointed since they are close to our home.  Won't be coming back, ever.

I love this boutique.  I am so glad they have a showroom now.  I cancelled my Lifetime membership, so I cannot find them at those gyms anymore.  They usually set up a spot at different gyms around the valley.  They have purses (I like their Big Buddha brand) and tons of accessories. Last Friday, I went to get a couple of things, good luck with that.  I ended up with over 10 items.  I got an awesome scarf, very unique.  Maiva shops in NYC for items that are a little different, so you don't look like everyone else.  I got a purse organizer, lets see if this helps, my bags are getting bigger and bigger.  My hubby always wonders what I carry in them.  A small child could fit in it.  I also got a couple of this key finders.  It has a strong magnet, so the key attaches to it and you don't have to dig around for it.  So nice.  I gave one already to a friend and she loved it.  Lots of bracelets with bling.  I love bling.

This is a great park.  We came for a birthday party the first time.  The twins loved the path and we went along it a couple of times, which was great since I wanted them to have a long nap.  The playground is also very good, they have a set for the younger toddlers and one for older kids.  My boy used the "surfboard" a bit.  I guess he will follow his daddy's footsteps.

We had an awesome time for my twins 2nd Birthday party.  They are very prompt and delivered what they offered.  Priscilla is very nice and patient with little kids handling the animals, including baby duck and chick.  The pony was a hit!  Their prices are very reasonable.  I will definitely use them again.

Horrible experience.  Unscrupulous people.  We needed someone to open the door to our nursery and they quoted us $49.50 + $20.  We decided to take the first person we called because we wanted someone immediately.  He locksmith showed up one hour later and demanded $49.50 + $125 or he wouldn't open the door.  We finally agreed to his "special price" of $49.50 + $85.  It took him less than 10 seconds to open the door.  We called the company to complain.  Linda apologized and was willing to refund the difference but I think she must have been shut down.  The second call we got regarding our complain pretty much inform us that what is done is done.  That the price is $49.50 + $20 and up.  Make sure you record what they quote you.  When you are experiencing an emergency you are an easy target for this kind of predators.

I already wrote a review about this place, I guess they have two entries, because when I check-in, my check ins come to this one.  Oh well, this is one of my favorite fro-yo places.  Not only do they have pistachio every time I go, but the seating is so cute and low, my twins love it.

I think this is going to be my favorite fro-yo place.  I liked the decor and the large selection of flavors, they not only had PISTACHIO, but also Banana, my two favorite.  Also, the texture seemed to be creamier than others.   I liked that the seating is low and round, so I can bring the twins without too much worry about sharp corners.

Very nice place in Fountain Hills. It did not disappoint.  We had the meatballs, the tamales one chicken and one pork.  I liked the pork better.  We also had the shrimp tacos, very tasty, and of course I had to have Tostones, delicious plantain slices that are fried twice, what is not to love about it.  My little boy loved them.  Service was excellent, they are very friendly.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  I have been meaning to visit this place for a while.  With restaurant week available, we decided to try it.  I had a fabulous meal.  I went with the restaurant week menu, while my hubby decided he wanted the enchiladas for an appetizer.  My appetizer was awesome.  I love beets, yes a lot of people don't, but I have an obsession with them.  This place knows what they are doing.  They were perfect, unlike last weeks.  Delicious red and golden beets with a little goat cheese and pecans.  My entree was the salmon, also cooked to perfection, moist and tender.  And the piece de resistance was my dessert.  I was nice enough to share it with my husband.  The fig and pecan pie with a scoop of cream cheese lemon ice cream.  I am still thinking about it.  The crust of the pie was a piece of art.  I am a crust girl, and this was delicious almost like shortbread.  Can't wait to come back.

We were at the park behind Mastro's with the twins.  We decided to walk around this plaza to check out if there were any new places.  We saw this new Indian/Pakistani restaurant.  It looked really nice and I was not sure I wanted to subject them to my twins.  They are not bad, however they are two years old after all.  They were very nice and accommodating.  They were even gracious enough to remove the tablecloth.  My baby girl thinks she is a magician or something because she wants to pull tablecloths all the time.  We placed one order of Chicken Pakora for the twins.  I was not sure they would eat. Well, they gobbled it all up in seconds.  I couldn't believe it, so we placed a second order.  We also had the regular Naan and the Aloo Naan, both very yummy.  I had the samosas and my husband had the chicken karachi, very tasty.  We will be back it was a great experience.  I am so happy I don't have to travel miles and miles to find a great indian restaurant.

I am so sad, I wanted to like this place.  What a disappointment! I love Fuego Bistro and I take several friends to dinner there.  I am glad the couple who was to join us at Fuego Tacos couldn't make it.  I wouldn't have wanted them to think that Fuego Bistro is similar.  It is a completely different  ball game.  The place is nice, but it is as cold as a meat locker (ambiance wise) and the waiters are as stiff and lifeless as mortuary clients.  The drinks were nowhere near as tasty as the ones at FB. We had a couple of tacos and left, we wanted to salvage the rest of our date night.

I really wanted to like this place since I love 5th & Wine.  What a disappointment.  The Shrimp Dumplings were so average and $10 for 4, is a little steep.  The place was not even fun, so I didn't even finish my glass of wine and we decided to go somewhere else.

I've been to this location 3 times already. They are always very nice and accommodating.  This one is closer to my home, so even though the menu is a little smaller, it doesn't matter as long as I can have my original rustica.   I love that pizza, it is the perfect crust with delicious creamy mozzarella and the right amount of tomato sauce.  I had a glass of the Malbec last time and it paired really nice with the pizza.  My husband had the soup of the day and it was really good.  Hearty and a little spicy, he was glad he ordered the bowl instead of a cup. I recommend this place to my mom's night out group.

I bought a deal from Living Social and I was a little hesitant because I had never been able to find a place in town to do Endermologie that I really liked.  I used to get the treatments in Portland every summer.  Well, I am pleasantly surprised.  Debbie does a fantastic job and she has an amazing deal going on.  I am going to keep doing the treatments because I think this is what kept me from gaining weight last summer when in OR.

I can't believe it's been three years since my first review!  I have been coming here, pretty much every week since then for my endermologie treatments, I love them and is what keeps my skin looking great.  I notice the difference when I skip my treatments while I am in Oregon during the summer.  Debbie also does my Brazilian blowouts.  She does an amazing job.  I have curly hair, but with the BB it makes is so much more manageable.  I do the treatments every 3 to 4 months.  Debbie also does a fantastic job with my haircuts.  I am trusting her with a lot of my beauty needs.

I just came back from Debbie's she has been doing my color also.  I was tired of my hair looking a little strawy, so I asked her to fix it.  She took her time and redesigned the whole color.  She put a lot of lowlights and 2 different kinds of highlights.  I love my new hair color, it has so much more dimension.  Debbie now does body and hair stuff for me.  I'm here more times than my husband probably would like to know.  Her prices are so reasonable and her work is amazing.  She takes pride in making you look your best.

We were on our way to lunch to another restaurant when we noticed the banner about TM. My husband could eat mexican food seven days a week, so we decided to give it a try.  They opened at the beginning of November, so they still have Alex Padilla as their Executive Chef.  We were so happy we had the opportunity to meet him and talk to him for a few minutes.    This place has been completely remodeled, I didn't even realize until a few minutes later that this is where Roy's used to be.  I loved the decor, simple, classy.  The decorative doors are really cool.  We started with a couple of margaritas.  My husband had the Taberna and I had the classic.  They were both excellent.  I was not very hungry so I decided to have the Jicama salad.  It was not only beautiful but also delicious and refreshing.  Loved the texture combination.  My husband had the tortilla soup, and the beef tacos.  I am not a soup person, but I found myself going back to my husbands soup 4 or 5 times more.  Every bite was a little different, one time some corn another the melted cheese at the bottom.  The presentation is really beautiful, a miniature cast iron pot, with the lid to the side, very clever.  The soup is not the broth base type, maybe that is why I liked it.  I only eat chicken soup when I am sick.  This is more of a tomato base and creamier.  The beef tacos are made with filet mignon, I took a bite and it was delicious.    I thought I was going to be good today, but then we had a couple of desserts in front of us.  I couldn't resist, I loooooove Tres Leches cake, so when I saw it in front of me, I was in love.  It was perfect, the texture, the milky/condensed milk oozing from the soft, spongy cake.  I had more than what I should have.  I will have to go on the treadmill a couple of extra hours this week.  I also had the flan, this is the Mexico City style with cream cheese, which makes it a little denser.  It was truly delicious, but I am still partial to Tres Leches, I think this might be the best one I have had in the past six years.  I'll post some pictures of the dishes we had soon,  they were too pretty not to picture them.  I am so happy this place is in Scottsdale,  I love Phoenix and its cuisine, however I have too many friends who are not adventurous enough to stray away from their area.  I will definitely come back sometime soon and enjoy a drink by the fireplace.  Really cool place!

I had a very good experience with my groupon deal.  I made the reservation through the website, it was pretty easy and I showed up and the guy who did my hair was really nice, too bad I can't remember his name.  He was very friendly.  I am pretty easy going and I was not having any special event, just a mom's night out, but I got a lot of compliments from my blow out.

I had an awesome experience yesterday.  Jessica did my hair and makeup.  I wanted something a little different, so I told her to flip my hair out.  At first I was not sure, it looked so different, but the more I saw it the more I liked it.  Then she did my makeup, I told her to do whatever she thought would accentuate my eyes.  I told her to pick any color she wanted.  It looked awesome.  My hubby looked at me and told me I looked like a Bond girl. I was very happy with my experience and I can't wait to book another appointment with Jessica.

I loved it.  I have been meaning to come hear for a long time.  I remember becoming a member when they were building this location, however I had not had the opportunity or time to visit before.  One of my girlfriends invited me to watch Skyfall with her.  I didn't mind seeing it again the same week, specially in such a comfortable environment.  We sat down on our orange recliners and we had a pillow and a blanket, how cool is that.  When I go to other theaters, I usually put my purse on one side, since I don't like strangers touching me.  Here there is no risk for that, the seats are huge, I felt like I was in a cocoon.  After we sat down, one of the servers handed us a bag of popcorn.  We ordered our drinks and enjoyed the movie.  I told my hubby that I didn't care how much it costs, I am coming here from now on.

I don't know why they removed their comfortable chairs.  It's like they wanted to make it clear, "we don't want you to hang out here".  Got the message, I will be going somewhere else.  Service is very slow and they never acknowledge it.  It seems the people who work there must hate their job, because they are always so moody.  My hubby used to go there quite a bit, now he drives by it, to go all the way to Echo.  I haven't been back in a few months, and I am not planning to go back any time soon or maybe ever.

After having a mini spa morning, my hubby gave me a call and we decided to have a lunch day.  Since I was in Old Town, I wanted to go back to Herb Box.  It was after the lunch rush, so we thought we might get better service.  We were right.  Eric was our server, he was sensational.  I had a delicious Coconut Shrimp Salad and my hubby had a Steak Sandwich.  His was not that great.  We washed down our meal with a Raspberry Hibiscus Tea, very tasty.   I think the key here is to go when they are not as busy.  I still think the hostess stand could use a little coaching to make guests feel welcomed.

I think this place is on its last legs.  I went there for a mom's night out and we were so disappointed.  I asked for one of my favorite champagnes (the Taittinger) and they did not have it.  OK, then he offered me another one which was good, I had it before, I didn't care the glass was $16.  When we asked for a food menu, our server told us they didn't have one since they were on a "limited summer menu", really??? Well, we had to ask what it consisted of.  It was a little bit of a joke.  Bruschetta, fries and potato skins,  really?  The other moms decided they were going to go to True Foods for dinner, but I didn't want to stay out too late since I had bootcamp at 5:30am.  I ordered the Bruschetta, it was a little sad.  I had a taste of each a couple of my girlfriends had a piece to taste, but we left 1/2 of it there.  At least I had a 20% off with my check in, so with tax and tip for one glass and the bruscheta I ended up paying $34.  I would have not minded if it was good and there was some ambiance.  There was only one other table with guests.  Too bad, because it is such a beautiful space.

I really wanted to like this place.  I know a couple of the investors and I wish they succeed in this new venture, however, there needs to be a lot of changes.  I met a girlfriend for lunch.  She used to manage a very famous restaurant in Dallas (that restaurant has been featured on Food Network a few times).  The food was sub par, I had a chicken and brie salad.  They put two uneven slices of brie on top of a pile of lettuce and a few pieces of shredded chicken, extremely bland.  My girlfriend had a pasta dish, she noticed that the mushrooms were canned ones, she told me it was a good thing she likes canned mushrooms (who knew).  Also, the asparagus ends were not trimmed, so the tough part was still on.  we decided to share a desert.  Wow, that was something, an not in a good way.  We ordered the bananas foster crepes. It was supposed to have whipped cream on top.  The cream had been beaten to death, so it was butter.  Don't get me wrong, I love butter, I could be Paula Deen's daughter, or at least a niece, but butter has its place.  Inside the crepes, the bananas were so oxidized that it looked like a chia pet.  You know when you peel a banana and leave it out it not only turns brown, but after a while it gets kind of fuzzy and mealy.  Well, that is what was inside.  I don't think I will be back, even if it is another invite from a friend. By the way, we asked to see Dave the manager, my girlfriend wanted to help out and make some comments on how to improve some things.  Our server told us he was too busy, really??? the restaurant was almost empty.  Not cool.

This is going to be the place to go in Old Town.  I had a fantastic time last Saturday.  Thomas was excellent at the bar.  He recommended the Citi-Zen martini, it was perfect, I had two.  We only had appetizers since we had dinner somewhere else, but everything around us looked fantastic.  The couple next to us was visiting from NY and they had the scallops and the chicken, both looked and smell great.  We will definitely be back with some friends.

I like this store, I find what I need.  I get excellent service from Taylor and Angela every time I visit.  I love that they have plenty of "unpadded" bras.  When you are a double D, you don't need padding, there is natural padding already there.  I don't need to look like I am a stripper.  The prices can be a little steep, but if you wait and sign up for e-mails you can find great deals.

I enjoyed this place a lot.  Of course when you are having fun with your friends, the places is even better.  It was our twin moms night out, so we had about 15 moms.  Good thing I decided to share not only my wine bottle but meals too.  Portions are insane.  The "small" calzone fed 3 moms and we had 2 pieces left.  We also shared the meatballs, they were very tasty and a Mediterranean Salad.  It was very good.  I will come back with my hubby for another great time.

I have been to Lorna's a couple of times.  She is very efficient and professional.  I was actually thinking about making an appointment to go see her, when I realized I have not written a review for her.  Her spa is inside another one which can be a little confusing.  I like that she does the whole facial with a microdermabrasion at a reasonable price.  I am also booking an appointment for my hubby.  I have been looking for someone who can go a great back facial and I am sure Lorna can do that wonderfully.

I've debated about my review for a few weeks now.  Unfortunately, the hairdressers don't seem to really  be very well versed in blow outs.  I used to have curly hair (I have the keratin treatment now), so I  know exactly how to work a round brush.  When I saw the type of brush they were going to use the first time I went, I knew it was not going to be good.  After I left, I went to the Mall and the girl with the flat iron fixed it for me.  If it wasn't because of the Groupon,  I would have never gone on my own.  For $35 I expect a better job than what I can do.  The girls are really nice and that is the only reason why I added the extra star.

I love Soma, unfortunately for me, the Kierland store rans out of size Small really fast when they have their crazy sales.  So I decided to check out the store at the Biltmore.  Upon entering the store, the two clerks completely ignored me.  I didn't care because I knew what I wanted and headed straight to the sale rack.  They had a couple of the dresses and pjs I wanted in size small.  I grabbed them and headed to the register.  I told the woman that was up front that I was ready.  She started talking to the other sales clerk.  Then she asked me if someone was helping me, of course I said no and I was ready to pay.  She started ringing without even asking for my passport member #.  I shop at this store a lot, so I get an additional discount; I informed her, she needed to search for my number.  Finally we were about to be done when the phone rings and she decided to pick up at the first ring, I was waiting and waiting, until I told her I needed to have this rung since I had a spa appointment.  Wow,  I am trying to give you money, you should value your customers a little more.

There is always a first one for everything, I never thought it would ever be for fro-yo.  This place is really nice, however, the flavors are not great.  I tasted the snickerdoodle and the pumpkin pie.  The flavors were so off.  I didn't want to taste any others because the only person there seem to frown upon once I wanted to taste the second one, so I chose to go for flavors I have had at other places.  I got a little bit of cake batter, cheesecake and white chocolate macadamia nut.  Well, my; first bite was of the macadamia nut one, and it was horrible, tasted of rancid nut.  So I decided to avoid that corner of the cup, then I went for the cheesecake, it was so tart and not in a pleasant way, so I thought, well how bad can cake batter be, well I ended up throwing the cup in the trash can, if I am going to get the calories I might as well enjoy them, that is my new mantra. OHMMMMMM.

I had the pleasure to meet Karen at the Fall Festival.  She was so sweet and personable.  She was sampling three of her flavors and I had 2 and definitely I am in love with the Cranberry Orange.  I have been thinking about it ever since, specially this morning, I miss having a biscotti with my cup of coffee.  Aaah, it would have been so perfect.  I guess I have to either take a trip to PHX or order online.

I am obsessed with this place.  I have never been a fan of yoga.  I have done it, but only once in a while.  I am too fidgety to lay still.  Being the bargain shopper I am, I got a groupon for 10 hot yoga classes.  I love going to this studio.  Today I will be going to my fifth class in 2 weeks. That is a record for me.  I used to go to yoga once every two to three months.  It gets packed, so you better get there early. The studio is very nice, clean, of course it is new.  I hope it never gets that smelly feet scent some places have.  Yes, those are the thoughts I have when I am supposed to lay there and relax.   It is hot, yes, freaking hot, but I love it.  You sweat buckets.  I bring an extra towel to wipe my sweat off.  I am even learning to lay still at the end of the class.  Yay!

This place is dangerous to my figure.  I guess I didn't care about it too much today.  I got so many wonderful baked goods.  They baked them right there, so it is fresh and you can taste it.  The blueberry lemon muffin was delicious.  I also got a strawberry lemon brioche, which was wonderful.  I am saving the lemon cake cookie for the twins.  I hope it is still available after their nap.  I didn't get a sandwich but I am sure coming back to check them out for lunch.

OMG, this place is dangerous.  I can feel my hips expand as soon as I park in front of the store.  I can't have enough of the Butter Pecan ice cream, so buttery and Pecany (is that a word?, I guess now it is).  It is always a treat to come here, thank goodness it is pretty far from my house.  My little boy had the raspberry ice cream, he ended up eating half of his sister's ice cream, too.  He is a fast ice cream eater.  The patio in the back is very cute and we had a great time enjoying the beautiful Phoenix winter weather last weekend.

What can I say that it hasn't been said already.  The concept is awesome.  Just blow outs.  The place is really nice and everyone was friendly. I had a Groupon, I made my reservation, it was pretty easy, unfortunately for me, when I tried to change the date to a Saturday, they were totally booked, so I kept my appointment for Friday.  I was having date night Saturday, but my hair held up really well.  Kristen did a really good job.  I am a little bit particular how people blow out my hair.  When I don't see a round natural bristle brush I get a little nervous that it is not going to look shiny and smooth.  Well, it was very shiny and smooth at the end of the job, and it stayed in great shape for a couple of days, it probably would have lasted longer, but I had to workout.  I agree with Gaby, it is an indulgence that can get a little pricey.  I will definitely use them for a special occasion.

I had a really great time last Sunday.  We went to see our fellow yelper Ryan C and a whole crew of local comedians.  We stopped by the box office to inquire about the tickets and time to come in.  She told us the show was at 7p.m., and that we could get in right then (it was 5:30pm).  We wanted to walk around downtown so we asked her what time would be ok to come in.  She suggested not later than 30 minutes before the start of the show.  We came back at 6:30p.m. and the young woman at the door told us they were not open.  Ok, then I guess they should have inform the box office personnel.  We stood there for about 10 minutes in the freezing cold. (We were having freaky weather).  I don't get my panties in a bunch, so this little confusion won't affect my opinion of the place.  We were offered the table in front of the microphone, great.  The manager was so nice that he let us reserve the seats next to us for other fellow yelpers that were on their way.  My hubby had his usual margarita and he said it was very good.  I had a vodka and soda, yes cheating a little bit on my diet.  I also ended up ordering the steak tips, they were really tasty.  I can't wait to come back with more friends.

I am bummed, this was my favorite Papa Johns.  We used to order pizzas at least once a week.  We had a little tradition with my hubby, Monday or Tuesday night we would order a pizza and open a bottle of wine and watch one of our shows recorded in our DVR.  We went last Saturday and the store was closed.  We called HQ and the rep said they didn't see the location in the website.  This store closed suddenly, boo.

I finally had the opportunity to take the whole family to enjoyed homey greek/mediterranean food.  It was a success.  The twins tried everything and those are some picky eaters.  I love the lentil soup, and I have told before in other reviews, I am not a soup person but this one is so delicious.  I guess I must have become a soup person, but I digress.  My chicken was so tender and marinated to perfection.  My little girl ate all her portion plus some of her brother's chicken.  THey both enjoyed the rice.  I was supposed to be off of carbs this week, but I couldn't pass up this one.  It is perfectly cooked rice.  The garlic sauce that comes with the chicken goes so well with it.  My hubby had a salad with some gyro meat on it.  He really enjoyed it.  The only bad thing is that this place is so far from us.  I could see having take out at least a couple of times a week, if I live closer.

I love candy stores, I try to avoid them, but I love them.  I've been to this place twice in the past couple of weeks.  Wow, have not been to the candy store in 3 months and then suddenly I'm here twice in ten days.  Better watch out or I'll be back on my Hcg diet in not time.   Love the gummy candies, can't get enough of them.

I love their cupcakes.  I had several.  You can buy them at farmer's markets or if you are lucky you can buy a deal of the day in some of the sites that offer them.  I had some from Doozy and Nikki, the owner, was really nice.  I love the chocolate one with jalapeno raspberry jam.  Not sure if she had them anymore.  Also the "apple pie" and red velvet.  When you get one of those deals, she will deliver them to your home.  That is awesome.

Because of my buddy Jon H., I decided to check this place out.  After my first evaluation, the chiropractor told me I was shorter on one side ( I already knew that from a long time ago).  He suggested I come every other day for a week and then once a week.  I decided to join the monthly program, it is way cheaper than paying my copay.  After today's visit (the third one)  I am even now, not that it is really noticeable the difference between legs, but that small variance can make my hip and lower back hurt like you cannot imagine.   Of course, I know I will get out of kilter as soon as I start on the treadmill, but at least I will keep coming to have them put me back together.  Today's chiropractor, Dr. Tom was awesome.  Thank you Jon for the recommendation, I love the idea of showing up to any location any time, no appointment needed

I like this place, I have been coming here since the twins were about 18 months old.  I am glad I don't have to climb with them anymore, though.  Not a fan of all the twirling and tumbling around.  Yeah, not looking forward to roller coaster in the future, but I digress.  What I like the most is when we have birthday parties here, since it is just the friends, I can relax and chat with my mom friends while they climb, slide and tumble around.  Parties are short and sweet, just the way I like them.

We decided to come to Tommy V's because of some of the reviews from Yelp friends.  I don't know if I should thank you or curse you,  I am supposed to still be on my Hcg diet, so I was not having anything.  However, my hubby decided he was doing the Restaurant Week dinner.  It looked amazing, so I took a little bite of his beet salad, ohh, perfectly roasted golden and red beets with arugula and goat cheese.  Then he had the Eggplant Torta, OMG, it reminded me of the Melanzana (italian for the Eggplant Torta) my daddy and I used to make on Sundays, I had three bites.  Then it came the Lemon Torte, my willpower caved and I had to have two bites.  I guess I will have to go on the treadmill a little longer this week.  Michael behind the bar was fantastic.  I had a taste of a few wines before settling for the Heavyweight Cabernet.  Zoran, stopped by to say hello, we have something in common, he also has twins.    I can't wait to come back with friends and have the Eggplant Torta again.

The grandparents wanted to take the twins for "ice cream" after lunch at Wildflower.  We were glad to see they had a Fro-Yo place less than 50 feet away.  The place is very clean and bright.  The flavors were very good.  I ended up giving the twins the Marshmallow one with some oreo crumbles.  I had a bit of it too.  It was very good.  This could become a staple after Wildflower.

I bought a Groupon for a peel.  It was so great I ended up buying a package of 6 peels.  Lauretta was very knowledgeable and she realized I take great care of my skin, so she tailored the peel to my needs.  I don't like to crack all over, since I have quite a busy social life, so she told me to let her know when I want a deeper peel (I think it is the Jessner one).

I went hoping to have the Bananas Foster, too bad they didn't have it.  I ended up with Cherry Amaretto, delicious.  I added a few oreo cookie crumbs and caramel sauce.  My little girl ended up eating most of mine.  Oh, well that is better for my hips.  My little boy loved his strawberry and cheesecake one.  The place is very nice and clean.  I am sure we will be back soon.

Yes, the place is nice, but it is true, the service needs a lot of work.  When I came in, I asked the hostess to direct me to the group of girls I was meeting.  On my way there, I girl jump on my path, I didn't know who she was, but she was so rude, she cut me off, and on top she gives me the "EXCUSE ME" with the two snaps and a zig zag attitude. Later I realized she was a server.  Way to go, customer service.  I just laughed it off, because I was going to have fun with my girls.  I love meeting girlfriends out and there is very little that can upset me enough to not enjoy my night.  I really wanted to like this place, but the owners need to hire more experienced management and servers.  Not everyone is cut out to do customer service, specially in the "service industry".  My drink was good, I stayed with a safe bet I have had before.  I asked if I could have a taste, instead our server said she would ask the bartender to match my taste and  if I didn't like it she could switch it. I hate returning drinks.  It would have been so much easier to just let me have a taste and if I liked it, I would have had it.  The cheese platter was really pathetic for $25.  Hopefully they will take care of the kinks, because the place is very nice and the music was great.  This could be such a great place to hang out with friends and chit chat, without loosing your voice.

I was so happy to see them at the City North Farmer's Market.  I bought the Bbq Pork single pies and the Steak Fajita.  I had a taste of the apple one. YUM!  These are awesome options when the hubby is out of town or if you have people show up suddenly.  Quick salad and a little pie, ta da! lunch. As a matter of fact, I am going to cook a few for a brunch am throwing next week.  They are so flaky and buttery delicious.  Can't wait to try other flavors.

The gelato is delicious, the atmosphere not so  much.  The prices are a little steep also.  $4 for one scoop.  As much as I would want to go more often, my hubby cannot do without his waffle cone.  They do not offer that.

I am not sure if it was the beers or the company, but I really enjoyed this place.  We are visiting different breweries with the Brews Crews and this place is a winner.  I had a lot of fun, it is a small brewery in the sense that they do small batches, but the location is fairly large.  There is not much decor, but the industrial look suits it.  They do not offer any food, however you can bring stuff in.  I brought a cheese and meats platter and some dips to enjoy with our friends.  It was a great afternoon enjoying a can of beer.

I haven't been to Timo in a few months, so I was excited to come back for our twin mom's night out. When we got there, they already had our table set up.  I am usually the first one, hey, I need a drink, but this time there were a few other moms already there.  We ended up having a table for 15.  Our server, Alexis was very nice and efficient.  I shared a couple of things with one of my friends.  Timo offers a great deal on Mondays, a bottle of wine and flatbread pizza for $19, an incredible deal.  I had to share the bottle, as much as I like my wine, I can't drink a whole bottle by myself.  I had a carb overload night, it was delicious.  I had not had carbs in about 4 weeks, so I could feel the bloat before finishing my last bite, but it was so worth it.  One of my friends had a delicious cocktail made with pineapple infused vodka, muddled mint and lavender.  It was very refreshing.  Last time I was there, the menu was a lot smaller, I am happy to see a great variety and food looked delicious.  I can't wait to come back.

My hubby has been trying to bring me here for months.  I would find an excuse every time; too far, I'm too dressed up, it's too late, like any of those had stopped me before.  Well, I guess the stars lined up for him yesterday.  My afternoon schedule was not crammed as usual and we had a sitter an a loaner car.  What more can you ask when you have to drive over 30 miles for a meal.   The place is in a little strip mall, on the Avenues side of Camelback.  I don't think I have ever been this far west on Camelback.  We got in and the owner, Esther, showed us to our table.  The music was a little loud, however within minutes it was lowered, so I guess someone else requested it before I did.  I started with a drink, the "Island Fruity" and shared a hand pie with my hubby.  The drink was deliciously sweet and the pie was spicy.  Great combination.  For my entree, I had the Yassa chicken and I had to order a side of the plantains.  My chicken was very good, I liked the sauce that topped it, it had papers, onions and olives in a creamy dijon, peanut sauce.  Too bad this place is so far away.  I would love to come back to try other dishes.  Maybe the stars will line up again another time.

I've been coming to this theater to watch the kid's movies.  It is so much easier to manage the twins and for that reason, I thank you SMG.  Having a table across them is like a psychological stop sign.  I don't have to worry that they will jump out of their seats and run up and down the steps (that happens at the end of the movie).  They like their pizza.  The grilled chicken strips didn't go so well, I didn't even like them, a little too slimy.  I had the Kale salad, my hubby had been raving about.  My only complaint is that they take forever to give you a refill.  I had three different people come by when I turned my light on, and it took more than 30 minutes to get a refill.  I forgive all that, because I can sit down and enjoy the movie for once.

I have been wanting to go to a Peruvian restaurant for a while now.  I grew up in Ecuador (borders with Peru) and when I was young I used to swim.  One of my swim meets was in Lima, Peru, so I got to experience their wonderful cuisine.  When fellow yelper Scott D. and my hubby set up a double date, I suggested we try this place.  Scott and his charming wife Tessie, joined us this week at Inca's.  I ordered a Pisco Sour, the typical peruvian drink, its in between a margarita and a moijo, without  mint.  It was on spot.   We enjoyed a Ceviche Mixto as a table appetizer.  It was very nice.  It had a kick to it.  Of course, I had the Aji de Gallina.  This is one of my favorite peruvian dishes and they didn't disappoint. My hubby had the Carapulcra, very tasty.  For dessert I had the alfajores, the Dulce de Leche filling was exactly how I remember it.  Yes, it is not cheap, but there are not many cheap places in North Scottsdale, so I was not too surprised.  I will definitely be back.

This was our third Sunday in a row.  If the twins eat, they get an extra star and the twins love this place.  This is the kind of place you like having in your neighborhood.  It has great breakfast/brunch items.  I almost always order the italian frittata with light cheese.  The twins have eggs and they share a pancake.  The pancake is huge, the size of a dinner plate.  My hubby loves the jumbo wet burrito and they have been nice enough to drench it in red sauce instead of green.  Today, they even made it for him since they did not have it available.  Service can be a little sketchy, but I think they are trying to find the rhythm.  I am glad they are open and I will keep coming back for more brunches.

What a great stroll into memory lane.  It is a cool, old fashion candy store with some unique toys.  After a great dinner, we decided to take a stroll around Old Town where we stumbled across this store.  I ended up getting one of my favorite candies, they are not usually available that easily and I also got some dark chocolate covered espresso beans for my hubby.  They had this cute airplane I had to have for my little boy.  What a great store.

I've been debating about writing this review.  I love cupcakes and I was so excited when I so this store.  The store inside the mall is very cute.  The staff is amicable, but not overly helpful.  Which is ok, the cupcakes look good, however, looks are not all, even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again, the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage, making sure to smoosh it down, in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).  At least I know I won't be tempted at the mall anymore.  I guess I should be thankful????

Wow, I am so happy I found this place. Actually, my hubby did.  It is in North Scottsdale, so I don't have to drive so long for a nice meal.  The restaurant is very clean looking and the decor is really nice and inviting.  We sat in the patio since the weather is so beautiful this time of year.  I had a glass of bubbly and Shrimp and Grits.  Yeehaw, those were some tasty grits.  A little bit large a portion of grits, but my hubby always has some of my food anyways.  A girl has to stay fabulous somehow, even at my hubby's not so svelte figure expense.  I had not had grits in over 10 years.  They were very creamy, with enough cheddar and jalapeño flavor.  My hubby had the shrimp Po Boy, a very tasty sandwich.  I was too full to try their desserts, even though they looked so tempting.  I guess I have to come back for some more.

I spend summers in Oregon, and the food truck craze there is amazing.  I am so excited that we are getting a few great food trucks in Phoenix.  I went to the parking lot of Sam's in N. Scottsdale and it was ok, however I had read a review of Aji and I wanted to taste it for myself.  I told the hubby we needed to go to the Sam's parking lot in N. Phoenix.  We packed to twins and headed west.  I lived in Ecuador for a long, long time.  I have visited most of the countries in Latin America and I do love their cuisine, so I was very excited to check this truck out. When I saw "Hornado" in the menu, I knew the owner had to be from Ecuador.  That is a typical dish.  I got to meet Joe Alarcon, who is originally from Quito, Ecuador, his son Giancarlo (he is the chef), as well as Giancarlo's wife.  Really nice people.  True family business. I decided to order El Gaucho, a steak sandwich with Chimichurri sauce.  Chimichurri is very typical in Argentina.  My sandwich was delicious, the crusty bread was perfect to soak up the sauce.  Of course I washed it down with Inka Cola, l love that pineapple soda.  I have not have one in 5 years.  We also got some plantain chips.  Oh the twins gobbled those down so fast, I barely had the chance to eat one.  I saw the empanadas, and they looked delicious.  I can't wait to try the other sandwiches, they reminded me of all the flavors I grew up with.  YUM.

I've been wanting to try pierogis for a long time.  Finally we had the opportunity because of the International Supper Club.  We had a huge turn out, so our table had about 15 people.  Even though we were so many and each paying separate bills, the wait staff was very nice.  My husband and I decided to try the 12 piece platter, since you can choose them in 3s, we decided to try the potato and cheddar, jalapeño and cheddar, chicken and farmers cheese and potato. We chose to have them pan fried instead of boiled.  Everything is better fried, don't you think?  The platter came with sour cream, bacon bits and caramelized onions.  The pierogis were delicious,  I washed them down with a European Sparkling Pear Juice.  So yummy.  We also ordered dessert, we had the 6 pierogis 3 apple and 3 sweet farmers cheese and poppyseed roll.  The sweet farmers cheese ones were not my cup of tea, but I didn't pick them, so I was fine with only trying a corner.  We will definitely want to come back.  We were going to take some home from the market next door, but we decided to hang out with some friends after, so we didn't want the pierogis to melt.  Next time I will bring them home.

I love this place.  It is so unexpected.  A restaurant at a car wash/gas station/market/etc./etc.  The place is so clean and eclectic, I love it.  The carne asada tacos are amazing, as well as the barbecue.  I tried all the sauces and they are awesome.  On my good behavior days, I have one of their salads, but when I am bad, I go for the Bourbon Pecan Pie,  yes, it is awesome and it will go straight from your lips to your hips, but it is so worth it.  I will be going to the gym, on a Sunday, to try to compensate for my little indulgence.  Thank goodness I have hubby to eat more than half of it.

We came to the Gingerbread house decorating event with the twins.  What a great time.  It was nicely organized.  They set the tables in the back and the smaller children had the houses ready to decorate, while the older ones could build them from scratch.  Then they had a table set up with different candies and pretzels and a sample house so you can decide what to do with your house.  The event was amazingly cheap, it was only $10 per child and it included breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast and fruit.  The twins had a blast and enough candy to keep them wired for the rest of the day.  Thank goodness the nanny is coming later.

This is Lola's coffee with a new a new sign and ruder people.  My coffee was awful.  Thank goodness is was just an espresso shot, so the pain was short lived.  I felt I was taking medicine.  The place has not changed much.  It could have potential, but I don't need to come back.

I have been wanting to come to this place for almost a year.  I was so happy when Monica O. set up the Breakfast Club at this location.  We had a huge table,  our server was great, having to take care of such a large table can be overwhelming, and she was trying really hard to be on top of everything.  I had the French Toast Combo, which gave the the option to have two slices of my choice of bacon, I had the jalapeño and the honey cured.  Both, really great.  I have not had bacon in months.  My husband chose his meal from the lunch menu, so he was in heaven, he is not so fond of breakfast food, so he was thrilled when our server told him it was ok to order from the lunch menu.  He had the pull pork sandwich with sweet potato fries, he ordered the fries just for me, so I could try them.  I love sweet potato fries.  I had four or five, so yummy.  Can't wait to come back, and next time I will bring the twins.

Ok, I don't know if I should love her or be mad at Bre.  I went again to get more cupcakes.  No wonder I need to get on Hcg every couple of months.  Her cupcakes and cookies are AMAZING.  We stopped yesterday by the North Scottsdale Farmer's Market (on Shea and 94th St.).  This was my first time at this Market.   My hubby stayed in the car with the twins and I walked around the market to check it out.  Out of the corner of my eye I spotted this beautiful cupcakes.   I thinks my brain has a radar to guide me to sweets.  I decided to get the Salted Caramel, 2 raspberry white truffle for the twins (we don't want to have battles over what color frosting they want) and a chocolate Euphoria for my hubby, I also got the Raspberry Thumbprint cookies.  When I got home the first thing I tasted was the cookie, OMG it was so buttery and delicious, I am sure I already gained 5 pounds just thinking about them.  My hubby didn't share his cupcake, I grabbed a mini bite while he was looking the other way.  I had a taste of the twins' cupcake, they had no choice.  Wow, these are some very moist, rich cupcakes.  The frosting for the raspberry was full of fruit.  Delicious!  I had to go back again to get some other flavors.  Good thing she told me she was going to be at the Scottsdale street fair by the Sports Authority parking lot on Indian Bend.  So, after we finished from a birthday party the twins had in the morning, we packed them back in the mini van and headed south.  This time I got 2 French Vanilla cupcakes, a Velvety Red and the chocolate Euphoria for the hubby.  I also got salted caramel cookies.  These cookies are addictive.  One of the things I really like is that she puts them in cups, so it is so easy for the twins to hold the cupcake and eat it.  Too yummy, I hope I can avoid her for a while.

I need to upgrade my review based on my constant return to their happy hour.  They have a very good one.  My hubby and I enjoy having an impromptu date sometimes in the middle of the week and we meet here for HH.  I love the Coctel de Camaron, it is exactly the way I love my shrimp ceviche.  Their skinny Margaritas are delicious, too, and since they are supposed to be skinny I guess you can afford two.  haha.  The other great idea they have now is their Tuesdays Tacos and Tequilas.  Last Tuesday it was a lot of fun.  They had live music and specials on tacos and margaritas.  I am glad I had signed up for their e-mail updates, that is how I learned about this new event.

My husband was here for a company event, so I decided to join him for the last 3 days of his stay.  I love that there is no casino at this hotel, so it is non smoking, YES, this place DOES NOT  smell like a dirty ashtray.  Sinuses were happy about it.  The hotel is clean and has a small fitness center, which was enough for the couple of days I used it.  The pool is in a little odd location, people from the Miracle Mile shops could see you hanging around there from the mall.  The room was good and I loved the electric shade, it made the room really dark, awesome sleep!  The only thing that is a little bothersome is that they are always trying to get you to attend one of their sale meeting for their vacation/timeshare thing.  Even though my husband told them not to, and the lady on the phone said she would notate it in the reservation.  I still got one of the "Experience" people try to book me for an appointment.

I wish this place was closer to my house.  I love, love, love this gelato.  The creaminess and soft texture of this deliciousness is amazing.  I had the Grisbi, a lemon cookie gelato with little pieces of lemon cookies and the Choco Wafer, YUM, no DOUBLE YUM.   The best part, even for the small cup you can have 2 flavors.  That is the best.  What is up with other places only letting you get one flavor for a small cup.  Ok, stepping down from soap box.  I all be coming back with my twins, specially since my little boy is a gelato fan. Yay!

Wow, this place is so cute and on top of that, it is delicious.  My hubby told me about this place almost a year ago and he was raving about the pizza.  Then, I have seen all the check- ins from Anna M., so I kept trying to make time to come and check it out myself.  I wish I had come sooner, although my hips and thighs might not appreciate that.  We ordered the Biaggia pizza.  I learned it is the most popular, I chose it mainly because I saw figs and prosciutto on it, two of my favorite ingredients.  Then we noticed the next table having a salad I didn't see on the menu.  Well, duh, it was in the specials.  They have daily specials on boards above the bar area.  We decided to share the spinach and kale caesar.  It was so fresh and tasty.  Then on the other table, I saw a dessert that was not on the menu either.  The owner told us it was an apple pizza, part of the special menu also.  Yes, I love to check out what everyone else is eating.  Our dessert was warm and amazing, and the scoop of vanilla  ice cream completed this perfect meal.  We were offered a taste of their homemade Amaretto.  What a treat, it was delicious.  This place made me very reminiscent of my daddy, we used to cook all our italian dishes on Sundays and my daddy used to make his own Lemoncello.  I definitely will come back and I won't wait almost a year to make it.

By now you probably know I have a sweet tooth.  When I learned that there was a new cupcake shop across from Kierland, I had to check it out.  While staying at Kierland with my mom group, we picked up a couple dozen cupcakes to share.  I have been back a few times.  I even bought some for the teachers at my kids school.  I really love the salted Caramel one.  That is definitely my favorite, the cake is moist and the frosting is sweet and salty.  My second choice would be toasted coconut.  I am not sure if the strawberry one I had was a fluke, but it was a little gummy, like undercooked.  The dulce the leche one was a little dry.  But so far, my salted caramel one has been spot on every time.  I have had four so far.  Their prices are so reasonable, I think they are the cheapest in town.  I also like that they give you a punch card, mine is almost full.

I need to stop the insanity.  I get these e-mails telling me I get additional 30% off, NOOOOOO, I can't pass up that offer.  What do I do?  Get in the car and drive 25 miles each way and get more stuff.  I am obsessed with this store.  I got sunglasses, a new wallet, a cross body purse and a pair of flip flops.  I guess I need to unsubscribe from those e-mails.  At least I didn't pay full price.  This is how I rationalized my purchase.

I love this place, maybe it was because the stars lined up perfectly or something.  We were hanging out with one of my favorite couples, we had a wonderful server, Matt, and the night was really great, though a little chilly for my Phoenician taste, lol.  I had a couple of flights of beer, Matt suggested them, since I am not an experienced beer drinker, he was spot on.  I loved them all.  We also had the schnitzel sliders, wow, they were awesome.  The pretzel was great, although we agreed that next time we should have shared.  We tried a couple of the sausages, I had a bite of each since I was so stuffed from everything else.  The lamb and the chorizo sausages are winners, again, those were great recommendations.  I can't wait to come back and try some other goodies.

I saw a segment on Sonoran Living about their teeth whitening.  Since they had a special, (yes, I love deals) I decided to get it.  I booked my appointment online and it was so easy.  Later that day, I stopped by to check the place out, it is on the way to my home.  I decided to book an appointment for my hubby, too.  They are so nice and efficient.  You just sit on a comfy chair while they paint the gel on your teeth and them a lamp.  It was a breeze.  I got my teeth all the way to the whitest they have ever been.  I have not tried their spray tan yet, but I am interested.  They also have a little boutique up front with really cute items.

I have to give a shout out to my fellow yelpers.  I trust yelpers I know personally or by reference from my friends' list.  Based on that I called Robert, I was not sure if he was going to be able to fit me with such short notice, but he came through, not only did he come through he showed up the day of the huge monsoon.  Even my nanny cancelled on me that day, but he showed up and worked on my tile.  I have had this tile forever and the grout lines were almost black.  My housekeeper has been going insane for years trying to fix it.  It took Robert a few hours but my tile and grout lines look amazing. He even did the shower stall with a new machine he has.  I know who to call when I need to fix my floors next time.

I really enjoy coming to this place for lunch.  It has so many great options.  I love the sandwich and salad combo deals during the summer and during the winter the soup and sandwich one.  I love the chicken chili and the chicken pesto sandwich.  For the salads, any of the ones with fruit are really good and they are very good at customizing the amount of dressing you want or even leaving the dressing off.  All of your meals come with a chocolate covered strawberry as a treat, sweet!  Once in a while the soup is a little too salty for my taste, but I still come at least once a month.  The place gets pretty busy at noon, but if you go a little later there is plenty of tables to choose from.   Another thing that really surprised me was that they do not accept tips.

I love this place, specially now that it has been remodeled and the best two stylist stayed (this used to be Snip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah).  Ms. Tara and Ms. Julie are really great. The salon is airy and fresh looking, and has a nice playing area for the kids as well as TV and DVD players for them to watch movies while getting their hair cut.    Today my little girl had the works, she even let her hair be wash in the "big girls" sink.  Ms. Julie finished her cut and made a beautiful braided crown and put little flowers around.  She looked adorable.  My little boy, well there is not much to do with a boy, but he got his hair cut nicely and spiked.  Total rocker.

I have been here four times in the past year.  This is a cute little place.  It has a small menu, but it is enough to satisfy your appetite.  This last time we were a group of 13 people and they were quickly and happy to accommodate us.  We sat in the patio area.  Our server was Fausto and he was really great.  This time I had the roasted rosemary potato pizza and a spinach salad.  It was really delicious, but Scott's fennel pizza, smelled like heaven.  I have had that one before, and I know it is amazing.  Several people ordered the potato chips nachos, they looked delicious.  I also had the Irish red beer.  I liked it.  They also offer flights of beer, which some people really liked.  I am just starting to drink beer, so I am not as adventurous with them yet.  I will definitely keep coming back.  It is a very relaxed and casual environment.

I guess I am liking this place.  I have been there 3 times in 2 weeks.  This place is on the modern side of italian fare.  It was a little funny after reading some reviews, when my father in law asked "where are the spaghetti and meatballs". I had to laugh.  We suggested he try the orecchiette with the sausage, rapine and chilies.  That is my favorite pasta.   The first time I had it, I noticed that the pasta is handmade, bonus points.  I have also had the gnocchi, they are good, but I think I will stick with the orecchiette.  I really want to try the polenta next time, sounds so yummy.   For dessert, I am obsessed with the Chocolate Budino, I keep telling my hubby to get his own dessert, although every time I order it, I cannot finish it.  The creamy chocolate pudding, topped with crushed biscotti and a meringue/marshmallow cream on top, DOUBLE YUM, so rich.  Service my second time visiting for a full dinner with my in-laws was a little slow, but this is a new restaurant so I will look the other way, because after all I enjoyed the company and don't mind spending extra time at a restaurant.  One thing I would beg them to fix is the A/C temperature, I always bring a sweater now.   My hubby loves the Margaritas Trent makes, I guess I have to call next time to make sure he is there.

OMG, the previous reviews were absolutely right. These women suck at customer service. My husband wanted a coffee for the road and a few donuts for the twins. He noticed the woman in front of him ordering also an ice coffee and repeating several times, " no sugar, no cream, no milk". My husband wanted just an ice coffee, no sugar since we use stevia. She was really rude when he was ordering the donuts. We finally left with our order, got in the car and drove away. I handed the kids the donuts and realized she shorted us, also guess what, my husband's unsweetened coffee, was full if corn syrup or whatever crap they use for sweetening that made it taste like a chemical spill. Just awful, he wanted me to taste it, heck no.

Based solely on the Groupon deal, this is a great investment.  For $25 you get a professional session and one 8x10 and 8 wallet size pictures.  The studio is really nice and definitely you understand why the packages are so expensive.  We ended up upgrading a little bit, not to the extend they would have liked us to, but oh well.  I gave them a couple of suggestions based on my experience from previous sessions we have had that were much more successful.  Overall we were happy with what we got.

This place is great, I have been a few times, not as many as my hubby, though.  It is a small family owned restaurant and the food is delicious.  The first time I had the gyro and my hubby had the Kafta.  They came toasted, YUM.  I tried my hubby's and it was delicious, too.  Last time I had the chicken shawarma and the mediterranean salad.  The twins had the hummus plate and chicken.  They were nice enough to split it and make sure that each item was separate, my little boy is a little bit of a freak about mixing his food.  The family is so nice.  I have so many more dishes I want to try.  Next time I think I want the Majadara, sounds delicious.  I love lentils.  I guess I should try the lentil soup before it gets too warm for soup time.

I used to love KK, and to keep myself in check I had one rule, I could only stop when the "HOT" sign was on and get one original glazed.  We were driving last night on Shea and I saw KK, then I saw the "HOT" sign on and scream, "Hot sign on, Hot sign on", so my hubby diligently swerved around and we went to KK.  I think this place is new, otherwise I would have known about it.  The service was chaotic.  There were only two families in front of us, however they were scattered all over the place and when we tried to order, they told us you need to order "there" pointing at a vague area near the window you can watch the donuts being glazed.  Again we asked, because there were all this people crammed near the window.  I really don't understand why you would stare a donuts being glazed for more than 30 seconds, the next one is going to get the same treatment, then again, I really don't get Nascar either. But I digress, by the time we ordered, just two glazed ones, then we had to wait in line to pay, what???  I wanted the donut hot, if I wanted a cold donut I would have gone to the grocery store.  So my wonderful hubby, stayed in line to pay and I went to sit down to have my hot donut.  I am glad they are smaller than they used to be, I had the first bite, it was ok, but no wonderful memories or angel singing.  After we finish, my mouth had a horrible aftertaste.  I had to stop for gelato to take the bad taste out of my mouth.  I think this will be good for my hips, I don't need to stop by again.

I had a great time last weekend.  My hubby had been talking about Federal Pizza and I have been reading all the reviews, that I couldn't wait to visit.  We were worried we couldn't get a table, because I've heard the wait it a little long.  We decided ahead of time that we were going to sit at the bar.  When we got there, we valet, got inside and there were two seats open right in the middle of the bar area, score.  We ordered the Manifesto, and since lately I've been easing my way into beers, I asked for some advise and the recommendation was great, it was the Sierra Nevada Kellerweis, I liked it a lot.  My hubby had the Four Peaks one.  The place was buzzing with energy and the servers were working really hard.  It had been about 20 minutes after we ordered and I saw a pizza coming by, it went straight from us to another person at the bar who I thought had gotten there after us, hum, ok, maybe I didn't realize they were here.  Ten minutes later, a server/manager? approached us and apologized for having given our pizza away and they made another one and they told us it was on them.  That was very classy, because I really didn't know it that pizza I saw go by was mine and they could have just said the kitchen was backed up.  Thank you again, Federal Pizza for being so aware and caring about your performance.  This was a Saturday early evening and there were people from every age range.  We also had the chopped salad which was delicious and for dessert my hubby had been raving about the berry cobbler.  I can't wait to come back.  I have so many items I want to try.

I love this Festival, we look forward to it every year.  I move my schedule around so nothing interferes with me being able to make it.  This year again, we had a great time.  We had pizza from Spinatto's and tacos from America's Taco Shop.  I had a piece of bruschetta from Postino, of course the fig, apple, brie one.  YUM.  After several attempts, finally the twins had cheese pizza, of course then they wanted more, they ended up having 3 pieces each, face full of tomato sauce and stains all over their superhero outfits.  Bruce Brown catering was handing out very generous portions of Jambalaya, and it was really tasty, with enough of a kick to it.  Kidstop had a great craft activity for the kids.  This event is so AWESOME!

I was so happy we decided to go to Union.  I read about the opening yesterday and since we couldn't make the James Bond movie, I wanted to do something different.  And indeed we did that.  It was so much fun to go to the recently opened UNION.  It is attached to the Biltmore Fashion Park.  When I went in, it reminded me of a miniature Chelsey market, with their little boutique stores, so awesome.  After walking around the different stores, we decided to grab a bite at Trattoria del Piero. I was impressed that for opening night, this was run so perfectly.   This place is run by Lisa G. and it is owned by the people from Queen Creek Olive Mill.  Lisa came to our table since I had a special request.  I was already blowing my diet with the drink so I wanted to make a little change in one of the dishes, she was very accommodating and very nice.  My drink was worth the calories, I had the Limoncello martini.  My salad was delicious, I had the Fruta di Mare.  My hubby  had Lisa's bowl of balls as a grinder and the Union Cocktail.  The place is really neat, so eclectic, cute little hipster girls with the berets and the guys with their funky black arrow like earrings and scarves. On another table, "old school" older Arizonan who knows everyone.  So different and great at the same time, not a single Ed Hardy shirt in sight, yay! We bought a box of the cupcakes "for the twins", wink, wink. I can't wait to come back

Wow, what a disappointing experience. My hubby keeps telling me to stop buying Groupons and I might start listening (cannot guarantee). I am not sure if it is because I had a groupon or not, however I didn't feel welcomed. I get my brows done next door by Koltton who is amazing.  First thing she told me was to wait in the waiting area since she was running late. Ok, my next appointment was not until noon so I was not too worried. 15 minutes later and I started getting nervous. I was about to text my next appointment when she came to get me at 11:05.  I was never given a cover up to put over my clothing, not even a dentist's paper bib. She just told me to lay down and she started removing my make-up, then a little rubbing of something else. After she put a gauzy feeling mask over my face. She removed it and said, "we are done".  I always tip, so I tipped her $10 and left. It was 11:25 when I got in my car.   I couldn't believe it, so I went to my groupon page to check.  It was supposed to be a 30 minute "Red Carpet Facial",  guess I don't need to come back.

This place is awesome.  I was walking back to Dillard's, yes, shocker alert, when I noticed this new store.  I knew I had to bring my hubby back.  He loves anything spicy, that's why he chose me, haha.   They have a great set up.  I usually don't taste stuff that is open for the general public, but I can appreciate that they offer tasting for so many of their products.  With so many spicy products, I am sure it will kill any germs.  They few I tasted, really burned, but were delicious.  We ended up buying 7 bottles, some salsas, barbecue sauces, dipping sauce, hot sauces, all of them were great, can't wait to make stuff with them.  I will come back for the Frostbite, I tasted it combined with Margarita mix and it gives drinks a great kick.

I love this place.  I was so happy to learn that Donna took over Glo Studio. What is even more amazing is that she is honoring the tans you had purchased with Glo.  What a relief.  I still had a couple.   She has always done a wonderful job on my tans.  I have a spa day with my girlfriends next week and I didn't want people to be blinded by my ghostly appearance, when lounging by the pool.  I made the appointment online, it was so easy.  I showed up and the new girl who was working that day (her name escapes me) was very nice and professional.  I always request "medium", by the end of the day it looks really dark, until you shower and that bronzing layer washes off.  I was in and out withing 15 minutes with a wonderful bronzed tone.  Yeay, color!

I couldn't believe my eyes. I went to pick up my take out order from Pita Jungle and oh my, a FRO-YO place (yes I was screaming in my head).  Just a few days ago, I was telling my hubby that Desert Ridge needed a fro-yo place.  I have to have one close by.  Why the 5 stars, because of Pistachio.  I hope they are smart enough to keep that one all the time.  My favorite fro-yo place does, but they are 22 miles away from home.  The place is clean and the space is pretty nice.  As other reviewer said, it will be a great dessert after PJ.  I know my twins will love it.

The moment you walk by their doors you can feel the blast from the past.  The sweet smell of fresh waffle cone got me at the door, what a cute store.  The decor is reminiscent of a 50s fountain soda shop you see in the movies, I am not that old after all.  They had only one young man working that afternoon and he was very pleasant, helpful and pretty speedy.  I couldn't believe the traffic at 3:45 in the afternoon.  I had the Caramel flavor of course and the hubby the capuccino one.  Really yummy.  I can't wait to come back with the twins.

I discovered this place just by coincidence, guess where they are located, yes, inside a cupcake store.  I had been wanting to do a detox juicing day for a while.  I even checked out the one Selma Hayed does, so when I found KJ, I was thrilled.  All the juices are freshly pressed and they are organic.  I have done the one day reboot twice now.  I am not going to lie to you, it was not easy, by the end of the day everyones heads looks like a juicy hamburger.  I try to get busy and be distracted the day I do it.  The last one was a lot easier, since I had so many things to do with the twins.  By 6 p.m. that day, I still had two whole juices to go, woohoo.  I all seriousness, the juices are very good, and this coming from a cupcake queen.   I love the Steve's Green Dragon, it has Kale, Green Apple, Mint, Cucumber, Celery, Parsley and Jalapeño which gives it a spicy kick.   The Anton and the Watermelon Mint are also in my must have list.  I mainly do this to give my body a shot of healthy veggies, although the first time I lost 4 pounds, of course that doesn't last long, I kept 2 of those off.  The second time I didn't loose as much, but I am at my lowest weight, which will probably last 15 minutes.   I am trying to give myself a buffer before my birthday binge.

My husband had been telling me about this place for a while.  So when I had the opportunity to go with him on a business trip, he wanted me to go there.  We were a group of 5 and he texted some number, not really paid to much attention how you are supposed to get in.  So we headed to Commonwealth, I was a little confused, then he told me they are inside this bar, way in the back there is a little door.  Ok, we waited then they opened the door and explained the rules.  Since my husband comes here quite a bit for business, I decided to be a good girl and not brake the rules of "no photography", but after seeing all the pictures on this page, I feel cheated.  Darn, I should have taken pictures.  The place is really small, I think there are 3 small tables. The craft cocktails are amazing.  I had the Aviation, super delicious.  I can't wait to go again.

I like this healthy new option in Old Town Scottsdale.  After spending sometime getting pampered I decided to get a late lunch.  I didn't want to get something to heavy.  I was glad to see this new place had great reviews.   My hubby decided to join me.  I ordered the Danish salad and the hubby had the Moroccan Turkey sandwich ( I had a quarter of it, it was huge).  The salad had pears, dates, blue cheese and greens and just enough dressing.  I was glad to see they don't drench the salads.  I dislike it when they overload them with dressing.  The sandwich was delicious and creamy too.  My hubby noticed the protein bowls and they looked very enticing.  Next time.

This place has grown on me.  I started going with my twin mom's group when it opened and I was not that impressed.  Then I have been going for happy hour a few times and I have been enjoying a few of their bites more and more.  The honey rosemary fried chicken is my weakness.  I also like their stuffed mushrooms.  Their moscow mule is very good and my go to drink.  I have had a few of their desserts and they were very tasty.

I just realized my family must be really clumsy.  I have been seeing Dr. Fitzmaurice, since I broke my wrist in 2011.  I tripped at a friends house and landed kind of gracefully on my wrist.  It was not my heels, as my husband thinks.  I just didn't notice the step, and I was not drunk, this happened at the beginning of the night.  I still went out to dinner with out friends until I could barely hold my fork.  Dr.  Fitzmaurice saw me when he was working at another center.  They took x-rays and put a pretty tiffany blue cast on me.  I later bedazzled it.  Then a year later I close the door of my car on my thumb.  Again I got an x-ray but it was not broken, I was just going to loose the nail.  Last week, my twins had a playdate at a friends house.  We were hanging around the kitchen and didn't notice that the kids were playing with the doors.  Suddenly I heard a scream and I knew it was one of my kids.  There was blood everywhere and my little boys finger was purple.  Someone shut a heavy closet door on his little hand.  I was trying to stay calm, but inside I was panicking.  I called my husband to have him meet me at the ER.  When I was en route he told me to just go to Dr. Fitzmaurice, that he was waiting for us.  Thank goodness, because from the time he smashed his finger to getting an x-ray it was less than 30 minutes.  He has this state of the art x-ray machine.  My little boy was so comfortable following the instructions to lay his little hand on it to see his bones.  He was fascinated by the screen, I was too, you could see the x-ray in the screen in seconds.   It was not broken, but he will probably loose the nail.   I hope this does not happen again, but if any of my kids gets their fingers smashed again, I will come here instead of waiting hours in an ER.

After my husband had a bad experience, I had debated about coming to this place. But I decided to give them a chance and convinced him to come with me.  I liked this place, it is pretty cute.  Nothing fancy, but comfortable. The edamame is a no brainer, I am not sure anyone can mess this up, so it was good.   The rolls are nice.  I had one of the tempura ones, and besides being really tasty the presentation was really pretty.  I was on a crunchy mood.  It hit the spot.  Service was quick and amiable.

The first time I came here was last year just a few months after they opened.  We were a big group for lunch and we had a pretty good time.  I don't remember what I had then, but I liked their beer.  Last Friday I went again for a UYE.  Our server was fabulous, really nice,  I like light beers, but with a little taste, not bitter.  He let me sample a couple he suggested and our host let me taste the Hefe Endings, which is the one I was eyeing.  I ended up with the Hefe.  My husband and I shared the southwest burger, we usually do that because most burgers lately are so gigantic and I don't need that many calories, don't get me wrong, I can finish it, I am just trying to be a little more conscious now that my metabolism is not as it used to be.  Well this burger is not that big.  It is pretty tasty and spicy (in a good way if you like spicy), but is not gigantic, its average size and I needed something extra, so my husband asked for the asian pulled pork sliders.  Not my favorite.  I am glad they are small and I had one, my husband could take the rest.  The ambiance is really nice and since we had a great group, I had a very good time.

I'm rounding up because I had a really good time.  The place is very nice, I like the patio, this is the same location were the coffee shop used to be.  We were a group of 17 women, so you can imagine our poor server was a little overwhelmed.  I had the steak skewers and those were amazing, the chimichurri sauce was great.  Very similar to the one I had in Argentina several years ago.  I was not in the mood for a margarita, but most of my friends had several, they look good and my friends said it was tasty.  I will definitely come back to try other items, and my steak skewers.

We love this place so much, that we decided to have our Valentine's dinner here.  I had the same dish as before, because it reminds me of the food my dad used to cook for me.  The pappardelle alla bolognese were delicious as usual.  I started with a Negroni as this was my dad's favorite drink.  Eli makes amazing cocktails.  He is an amazing bartender, he was so sweet to come by and say hello.  This time I started with the beet salad, wow, I love beets and the golden beets were so delicious atop a bed of arugula with a creamy dressing.  My husband had the skirt steak because they did not have the gnudi on the menu anymore, gasp!.  I am sure he will survive.  I had a bite of the steak, it was cooked to perfection.  For dessert we shared the salted caramel cheesecake.  Perfect finish for a perfect meal.

I love having this healthy option near home.  I have been here twice now and I enjoyed it every time.  I keep having the same thing because it was so delicious.  The local fish is a platter with grilled fish, any way you like it.  I always choose the south of the border, it is spicy, but not burn your tongue spicy.  I love it.   You also get the cole slaw and tomatoes and onions.  I never eat all my brown rice.  I was glad that the second time I got it, the amount of rice was smaller, I still left about half of it on the plate.  I am a portion conscious person and I think the piece of fish is really big.  My hubby had the seafood salad and it was delicious, I stole one of his grilled shrimp.  The first time the wait was a little long, but it was the first week they were open.  The second time the food was out within 20 minutes, which is very reasonable.  This will definitely be in my rotation.

I love, love, love their happy hour.  They have a very generous happy hour time.  It goes until 7p.m.  Their margaritas are delicious and only $5 during HH. The daily taco is only $1.99 during HH, that is the only HH food.  I used to not like corn, but now I am addicted to their street corn. The salsas that come with the chips are great, most are super spicy for me, but my husband loved them. First time I was here, it was with our International Supper Club.  Now I come with my husband a few times for they amazing HH.   The place is very cool, I haven't been to a church in ages, but  I will come to this one anytime.  Parking is a little tough, you might have to find some parking around the corner on the street.

This is my favorite Gap store.  I visit it weekly.   Even the sales reps know that, once I pay for my items they say: "see you next week".  Yes it is a disease, but their items are very well made and the fit is great for me.  Lynda is my favorite, she is always so helpful, but every one there is very nice.  If you have a GapCard, on Tuesdays you get an additional 10% off on every item.

I had my twins there since they were 18 months old.  They used to go part time until they went to preschool.  The preschool program is amazing and Mrs. Bates is the best teacher.  To this date, my little girl still wants to go visit Mrs. Bates to her old school.  I loved that they had very few days off, unlike regular schools or other places that close all the time.

I love Medshape, this is my place to go when I overindulge.  After I had my twins a few years ago, I was having trouble loosing the weight.  Even working out every day and watching what I was eating didn't move the scale down, it actually was going up.   I had never had that problem before.  I learned I had some thyroid issues that had developed, so I decided to go on the Hcg diet.   It worked and I was back to my pre-baby weight.  It is not an easy diet, but it works, you just have to put your mind to it, for a few months.  After that I do my usual yo-yoing of 5 to 8 pounds, specially when I come back from Oregon.  I don't go on the Hcg anymore, but I do the fat burner/B12 shots.  What this does for me, it keeps me accountable.  I know I have a weigh in coming and I make better choices.  I love food, and I have cheat days.  The people working there are really friendly.  I have known Leyla now for almost 3 years.  Nina is also great.  I have had a few of their protein bars, I like a couple.  They are not to snack on all day long.  They are just to have something, so you don't binge later.  They are not candy bars, so don't expect them to be a dollar.  I buy some of my protein bars from Amazon and they cost about the same.  Now I am working on my buffer weight, lol.  After all I am going to Oregon in the summer.  I am now, 8 pounds lighter that before I was pregnant.

I am happy to see this company grow.  I remember gazillion years ago, when I lived in FL, I saw the first Rita's.  Back then the store only offered Lemon and Cherry flavors.  I used to love to stop by for a cool treat.  When I saw this store, I wanted to visit it.  Wow, things have changed so much.  They have so many flavors now.  They also have a custard that they mix with the italian ice if you so prefer.  This is a refreshing goody, specially during our hot days.  My little boy likes a few of the flavors also.  We enjoy hanging out at this place savoring out cool treat.

I am obsessed with this place.  I am so glad they are about 25 miles away from my home, otherwise I would be there every weekend.  The wait is a little long once you hit 8 am., however I am "lucky" the twins wake up at 5:30am everyday.  After getting ready and gathering everything we needed we headed out.  We made it just after 7:30 am.  The only sad thing I realized this time is that the balloon twister person does not arrive until 9:00am.  Oh, well.  I am here for the food really.  I almost had a repeat of the first visit, but I decided to try a different pancake this time.  You can make any kind of combos.  So I decided for the Chilaquiles benny and the sweet potato pancakes.  I am torn, I think I almost liked the sweet potato pancake better that the pineapple upside down cake one.  I guess I have to go again to make sure.  The chilaquiles benny were so perfect.  Instead of an english muffin is a tortilla base round, so yummy, with a layer of pulled beef barbacoa, topped with a perfectly poached egg then draped with this creamy spicy sauce.  Sooooo good.  The kids had pancakes and my hubby had a breakfast taco plus the chilaquiles benny.  This time I also enjoyed the blackberry mimosa and the hubby had the am margarita, which was so strong he couldn't finish it.

This place is very nice.  We decided to go on a Sunday around 10:30, I was surprised how busy it was.  We were 3 adults and 2 children, we had a coupon for up to $12 off, so it ended up costing around $76 for all.  Once you are in, they take you souvenir picture and then you can wait to watch the 3D movie or head to the butterfly area.  We decided to wait for the movie since it was only one minute away.  I am glad we did.  Even my kids loved the movie.  It was so funny to see them try to catch the 3D butterflies.  Once the movie is over you step into the Butterfly emergence gallery, where you can see the different stages of a bunch of butterflies, we saw some about to go from chrysalis to butterfly, it was really amazing.  After you enter a chamber and then there is the door to the Conservatory, where all the butterflies are.  This part is awesome.  There are so many varieties of butterflies flying all over and they can  even land on you.  My little boy loved it.   While my little boy stayed in the conservatory with dad and grandma, my little girl and I went to see the rest.  Before exiting you go to another chamber where you check in the mirror if you have any butterflies on you, since they want to make sure none escape.   You head out and walk through the small cafe and then there is a small room with 3 little glass tanks, one with a huge black scorpion, the other with a large hairy spider and the third one with the scorpions you see all over the place here in the valley, little brownish ones.  They have placed a couple of black light flashlights so you see how scorpions glow in the dark with the flashlight.  That part only took us about 5 minutes.   The last exhibit had a few fish tanks some with fresh water fish and others with ocean fishes.  They also have a viewing tank, they explained it is not a touch tank anymore because besides the rays, they have now 3 kinds of small sharks. The tricky part is the exit, you have to go through the souvenir store, so it is hard to leave without spending more money,  I guess that is the purpose.  Good thing grandma bought them a couple of things so the twins were happy.  Overall it is a great experience.

Great place, really happening.  We found a spot in the bar area.  It was around 7:30 p.m.  and it was crowded.  We had a few tapas, I loved the stuffed dated and one of the stuffed peppers.  Also the steak tapas were really good.  I ordered a Ginger Pear martini, very nice.  This place gets pretty loud, but still fun.  Service was good, my husband loves this place, he brings people every time he is in town, so it was my turn, haha.

This is a great addition to the area.  I am glad we have another choice where to go for mom's night out.  It is a cute place with and interesting menu and wines.  I was not aware until I went there that they make their own wines, and some of them are pretty good.  I was also surprised to see Four Graces Pinot Noir in their list. That was my latest discovery in Oregon and is one of my new favorites.  I couldn't believe they have it, since it comes from such a small winery in Oregon.  I loved the Shallot marmalade bruschetta, it was very tasty.  The salmon roll was really good too.  On Mondays they have a deal for a chef's choice pizza and a bottle of their wine for $20.  When I went with my hubby for Happy Hour, we had the sliders, they were very tasty.  Good place to hang out and my hubby could have his margarita since they have a pretty full bar.

I love this place.  I am so glad it is close to my house.  The food is simple but very well prepared.  My kids love it, so that makes me sooooo happy.  I have picky eaters, so when I find a place that has great food and my kids eat it all, I consider that a winner.  They usually eat the chicken and hummus, it come with pita triangles, it is pretty large for a kids meal.  My kids love their rice, so I usually order the combo so I give them my rice.  I have had the chicken pita and the platter before.  They are very nicely flavored.  I think they spice it in a way that is a little more approachable to everyday palate, which is I don't mind, I think that is why my kids love it, it is flavorful, but mild at the same time. I always come armed with my bag of coloring stuff, so my kids are entertain while we wait for our food to be delivered.  Service is friendly and prompt.  A  mom cannot ask for more.

OMG, I am delirious.   This event was right up my alley, all the sweetness and carbs necessary to put me on a comma.  LGO went all out and provided FULL SIZE items.  The cookies were gigantic.  Since my hubby was sent away on business, I asked my friend Maryanne to come with me.  I am so glad,  because we shared the items we sampled.  I couldn't possibly sample as much.  I loved  one of the cakes that had the peaches on top, so moist and delicious.  The cookies were great, but what amazed us the most was the home made english muffins, OMG, they are so delicious.  My friend ended up buying some to take home to her family.  The gelato sampling was awesome, I loved, loved, loved the peach sorbetto, so refreshing.  The mint, chocolate chip was great, also.  I could taste the fresh specs of mint.  My friend gave me a great idea for the twins birthday.  I am going to have LGO cater an ice cream social for us.  Hopefully they can make the cookies a little smaller.  They can make any flavor ice cream you want  as long as you order at least a gallon, which is going to be easy, most of my twins' guests come in pairs, so the number is pretty high.   Thank you, Lindsey for setting this amazing event up and of course all the people from LGO who were so gracious and informative.

This is a wonderful place.  My husband and I have come a couple of times.  We usually don't plan, so we don't mind sitting at the bar.  It is fun to see all the action there.  The first time I had the Amante Appasionato, super delicious drink, I don't remember what we had to eat because it was a while ago and most of their menu seems to change a bit.  This last time I had the scallops, they were perfectly cooked and the sauce with the bacon made for a scrumptious bite.  My husband had the charred octopus, this is one of their signature dishes and I can understand why.  This is the best octopus I've ever had.  It was not chewy at all, tender with a nice smoky taste, delicious.  I had a couple of cocktails, one was off the menu, a version of the Ice Queen but with gin instead of vodka, really great.  How could I forget to mention the dessert, oh my, this chocolate toffee cake with mascarpone ice cream was to die for.  I could have liked the plate.  The place is small inside, so if you want a table, better make reservations.  They have a nice patio, but on cold nights I think they keep it close.  I am a definite fan, I want to come sometime for brunch, the menu look

Love this place, it is from the same people that own Crust, so I was happy when we chose it for our last twins mom night out.  Their HH is amazing, I think I had my pizza and a beer for less that $12.  The concept is really neat.  You choose your crust, they offer white, wheat and gluten-free and then your can choose your toppings.  If you are not up to making those decisions, they have some suggestions on the board.  They also offer salads.  Tim is always so helpful with the wines or beer.  The first time I went we were a large group, so it took a bit to get all the pizzas out.  We were 20 women, we took over the patio area, Armando was also very nice helping us with refills for our drinks.  I enjoyed my experience so much that I had to bring my hubby. The weather is so beautiful right now that we couldn't resist but enjoy the patio.  He chose a wheat pizza, so I had the opportunity to taste the crust.  It was really good.  I might get it next time.  Although their regular crust is so yummy and chewy.  We'll see.

I have been wanting to try coolsculpting for a long time.  I have gotten quotes from a couple of places, who want you to commit to more than one area to offer you a discount.  When I started with Arizona Aesthetics,  I was doing Zerona.  I have done it before and I knew it is hard to see much results.  Fortunately, they had a fantastic price for coolsculpting and I didn't need to do several areas.  I decided to do one area, which is what has always bugged me.  Since I didn't have enough fat to use the suction piece, Liza suggested the plate one.  She explained to me that the first 15 minutes are a little uncomfortable, until the frozen/burning sensation goes away, I guess your skin just gets numb.  Indeed, after 15 minutes I couldn't feel the pain anymore (not that it was intolerable).  Now, after the treatment, you feel numb and your skin almost feels a little swollen.  The days after, the treated area will hurt and also itch.  I am one of the few who will have pain for a longer period of time.  I had to google that, because I had that pain (not horrible but noticeable) and itch for almost 3 weeks.  It's been 5 weeks and I am starting to notice a difference. The full results are supposed to be seen by week 8.  I am very happy with my procedure and I want to do another area now. Barney and Liza have always been very friendly and professional.  Can't wait to do my next treatment.

I loved this place.  I think I am enjoying small breweries more and more.  I had the Scottsdale Blonde, it is very smooth and light beer.  I also had a taste of another one that had a great coffee flavor, I forgot the name.  There is no food service, however you can bring food in.  We also brought our own game to play, however they have a cart with some board games in case you want to linger.

This is a wonderful, cozy place.  My hubby and I have been there a few times now.  All visits have been great.  The last one, we invited one of our friends who lives in the neighborhood to join us.  He was so pleased.  We started at happy hour, their HH deals are great.  I had the arancini, so delicious.  The risotto balls filled with mozzarella and then deep fried and with a reduction of balsamic on the plate, what is not to like.  Creamy inside and crunchy outside, did I mentioned they are deep fried?  We also had the Short Rib Bruschetta and the arugula salad.  Our friend arrived after HH so he ordered a salad that is not on the menu anymore :(, it was a deconstructed salad with salmon.  My hubby also had a pizza.  I wouldn't go there for pizza, since there are so many other places that do just pizza, but the rest of the items are amazing and don't miss the bread and butter bread pudding.  It is AMAZING.  Can't wait to go back.

This was a fabulous event.  I can't believe I was able to see Jon and Amy H.a few times.  The place is so big and it was pretty crowded, but it was flowing at a good pace.  I had no trouble getting samples of the items I wanted.  I didn't try everything, because I think it is physically impossible, although my hubby my disagree.  Twisted Rose had the Pulled Pork stuffed apple, really delicious.  I also loved Mastro's lobster and mash.  The Hyatt scallop was so delicious as it was the little chocolate caramel tart.  I think my husband must have had 6 or 7 of them.  I also was able to chat with the lovely Becca H. for a few minutes.  I loved the location, last time I went to Phoenix Cooks was a long time ago, when it was at the Biltmore.  I like this location much better.

I have brought many people here already that have written reviews for this place and I haven't, shame on me!  I love this place.  I am so happy we have this concept in North Scottsdale.  I have been coming to this place almost from opening date, I remember still smelling the varnish on the wood, lol.  They have a great patio, and twice a week they offer free wine tastings.  If you sign up for their e-mails you can get the details.  I love knowing what they will be offering.  You can also do flights of the wines they are offering, or if you don't like what they have open at the time, what I have done is buy a bottle and enjoy it there, whatever you don't drink they will re-cork.  Brook, Barry and James are very helpful and can steer you to the right wines for you.

I am so thrilled to find out that KJ opened a store in North Scottsdale.  I try to juice once a week (twice this one since I am going to CA).  I don't have to pack my cooler anymore, they are just about 15 minutes away from my house.  I love doing the one day detox, but I have to make sure my hubby doesn't drink my juice.  He loves the Green Dragon, the jalapeño gives it a nice spicy kick.  I also love the Hot Yogi and the Keri.  I love that the juices are fresh and nothing is added to preserve them, so you have to consume it within 3 days.  Make sure Alexandra puts the numbers in the bottles so you know in what order to take them, although I sometimes have just drunk them in whichever order, they are all so yummy.  I have had other juices before, and these for my taste are the best.

I guess the secret is out.  I was trying to keep this for myself, sorry.  We have been coming here a few times already.  We love the coziness of this place.  Greg and his dad Steve are awesome hosts.  By the way, we met them when we came here, so we didn't know them before.  It is amazing that you can get great wines for $5 during their HH, which goes all the way until 8p.m.  There is also an option of $9 glasses of wine, I might give them a try once I'm done with the $5 list.  If you like beer, they have a very large list for $3 during HH.  We always end up ordering the cheese and meat platter, which at $8.50 is a bargain.  The place reminds me of some of the bars in southern Spain, where the emphasis is on the drinks and hanging out with your friends.  We drive 25 miles each way to hang out there.  We have to flip a coin to decide who will be the designated driver that week, lol.  Can't wait to go back.

These guys spend so much effort in their marketing, but fail to deliver once you get in the door.   I have been there many times, not by my choosing, with my parenting group.  The first time we went for our mom's night out.   They were offering us a "special extra HH until 9 p.m." that only included local beers, house wine and well drinks.  The local beers are only coors, bud and michelob, when my friend asked for Four Peaks, they told her that was not included.  My friend commented "I thought FP was local".    Whatever, I ordered what I wanted, I didn't want a headache the next day.  For food I asked for the slider trio, when the server deliver it to me, she dropped the top bun from one of them.  She immediately said, "Oops, I'm sorry, I will have them make you a new one.  Ok, off she went with the top from the floor.  A few minutes back, she comes with just a top, hmmm, how do I know it is not the same one.  I said, no thank you, it's ok, I don't need to have 3 sliders anyways.  The next week I got an e-mail from the manager saying that I won a Happy Hour for me and friends, it turns out all of my girlfriends got the same one.  I declined mine, because I wanted to write this review as fair as possibly.  I have been there 4 more times for the HH that my other girlfriends have won.  One of them even gave me a free drink card, but that includes the aforementioned list of drinks.  Again, I gave it back and ordered what I wanted.  They keep complaining about the place every time we go, and I keep telling them, that this is not going to change just because we keep going.  I just go for the company, I  have learned to drink beer just because of places like this.  I am sure this is not the last time I will be there after all I saw some other girlfriends signing up on the list.  I am sure they will be the next winners of the HH.

I have been wanting to try this new location for over a year.  Time seems to be passing so fast.  Finally I was able to have a chance yesterday, so I tried something new.  I tried the Porky and a bite of the Chicken Tikka Massala.  I liked the Chicken Tikka Massala much better than my choice, but since I was sharing mine with my mom, I had to be mindful of spiciness.  I am sure my mom wouldn't have liked the spiciness of the CTM, I on the other hand loved it.  I will have it on my next visit.  I also want to check out the Steak and Mushroom one.  The location and decor is really nice.  The outside bar area looks really cool.

This is a good option when I cannot get to my favorite juice place.  They are not 100% organic as the other, but only "the dirty dozen".  The flavors a ok, I liked the Oh Ginger and the Sweet Greens,  I always need a little fruit on my juices, sweet tooth issue.  The price is comparable to the other places.  Juices are not cheap, but it is worth it.  They are located next to the True Foods, across from Armani Exchange.

This is my favorite Fox Concept restaurant.  I couldn't believe it.  The place is beautiful and so far the food we have tasted has been amazing.  My husband cannot get enough of the Korean skirt steak.  I took a few bites and I almost wanted to order that.  I rather save my calories for the drinks and dessert.  The Fig and Ginger mule is my favorite, specially when Tanner makes it, although Christina did a really good job also.  I cannot have enough of the Croissant Bread Pudding, it is a diet buster, but so worth it.  Next time I am going to have the salmon appetizer, the person sitting next to us at the bar recommended it highly.  It looked delicious.

I am so excited for Alexandra.  Kaleidoscope Juice has another location.  They just opened yesterday 12/27/13.  After a week of holiday eating, I needed to cleanse my body.  I could feel it, so I headed to the new location and got my favorite juices.  Green Dragon is my all time favorite.  I got Anton's Spinach, Hot Yogi, and Keri also.  They will also offer salads, smoothies, shakes and coffee at this location.  It is really cute, just a little bit west of Scottsdale Road on 1st. Avenue.  Great location in Old Town.  Maybe after a night of partying and drinking people should consider detoxing here.  Just a thought.

I was so happy when they announced they were opening a location in Scottsdale.  This is a really fun place and I am sure it will be a hit in the area.  There are a couple of kinks still to work out, but I am sure they will take care of it.  We went for the grand opening, we sat at a communal table with several friends.  I was having such a fun time that I missed the ribbon cutting ceremony.  My first drink was the Dr. Funk, very fruity and rummy.  I think it could be dangerous, because I was downing it pretty fast.  My second one was the One Eye Pyrat, I love ginger beer, so I wanted to try it.  That one was good, but I liked my first drink better. To eat we had the Ahi Tuna Wontons, Pork Tacos and Johnny cakes.  Everything was really good.  We never got our sweet potato fries, but they took them off the bill.  It was a pretty confusing table, so I don't blame our server Charlie, he was trying to take care of a table of over 12 people.  I already know what I am getting next, can't wait to be back.

I thought I was not going to like this place.  The first time I came, I was not in a very good mood, so I left without trying anything.  The second time, I came with my girlfriends.  We had 14 ladies and we had a really great time.  Service was good and the food was very good.  We had a few pizzas, the med plate and a couple of salads.  My favorite is the med plate, it was hummus, baba ganoush, olives, cheese, peppers, couples of different breads, this is really awesome and big enough to share with a few friends.  Last time I was there, 4 of us shared that plate.  The wine list is good, my only issue is that the glasses of wine are a little pricey.  Most of the ones I can have are over $13, but that won't deter me from coming back.

My least favorite juice place of all the ones I visit every week.  I might have had a similar experience as Megan A.  My beet juice was supposed to be good until 3-13.  I bought it the night of 3-12, I was not thrilled to get something that was about to expire, but I wanted to taste a few.  I bought 3 different flavors.  I didn't care for any of them.  The flavors are not that great.  It is also as pricey as my 100% organic juices and these are not 100% organic.   I only stopped by because they were still open and I wanted to juice the following day.  I don't think I will be coming back, when I have other options that are fully organic and have better flavor.

This place is really nice, open and very modern looking, with clean lines.  I shared a prime rib panini with my husband and the cinnamon roll.  Both were delicious.  I don't eat beef very often, but when I do I expect it to be good.  This was excellent, I am actually craving one writing this review.  I saw other items being delivered that looked great.  The french toast looked so good and the hash browns seems so yummy  I almost ordered a side.  Our service was prompt and friendly.  It is a counter order kind of place.  I am sure I will be back for some more.  Parking in the area is tight if you are going to stay longer than 30 minutes.  I am not sure what they will do once other restaurants open.  I will try to go during off peak times.

I have been going to the Athleta store in Portland and I was happy to see the one in Kierland open last year.  I love their yoga pants more than any of their other products.  So far, I have 4 pairs, 2 long and 2 capris, the other bonus is that they are not see thru, I checked, don't asked me how.   The only downside is that they are never on sale like other store (hint, hint, across the street).  I am glad I can at least use my rewards points to make them more affordable.

This is such a cool bookstore, very different from the big box ones.  The first time I came here was while waiting for Southern Rail to open for brunch.  We bought a couple of books for the kids.  My son is hooked on DinoTrux, while wandering around we noticed that the author of the books was going to be there the following week.  We came back with the kids, of course and they had set up the back area for the author to speak to the kids and show an episode of DinoTrux (Netflix now has a show based on the books).  Because they were having technical difficulties with the showing of the episode, the author started reading one of the books.  It was so cute watching the kids gathered around him listening to the story.  The issue was solved and we got to watch the episode.  The bonus, there is a bar in there, so I had a mimosa while watching DinoTrux.  At the end the kids got their books signed.  This is definitely a great spot.

This store moved from the Promenade to the NW corner of Scottsdale and Thunderbird.   It is a wonderful store, with a lot of educational toys and some original ones.  The play area is really nice.  I think my twins are about to outgrow it, but it is worth spending sometime there.  Last time we were there about 1 and 1/2 hours.  It is $9 per child and they can play with all the toys for as long as they want.  The place is very clean.  Kids and parents are required to wear socks.  The day I went there was a mom and kid who were barefoot.  I guess they don't police it very well, but hopefully people will understand that it is the only way to keep the place neat.    The play area is for children up to 5 years old.  On a hot summer day, it is a very good option.

Wow, I can't believe I am becoming such a Fox Concept Restaurant fan.  This is another winner.  I am on a no carb diet and the options here are amazing.  If you want healthy and tasty fare, this is the place to come.  I love, love the chopped vegetable salad with the grass fed steak or the salmon.  After my first introduction to this place, I realized I had been three times in one week.  I had to make excuses to drive to the area, so I could go eat there.  It is a good 25 to 30 miles from my home in far north Scottsdale (yes, that is where BFE is).   I had a taste of the avocado hummus and it was delicious.  My kids and husband had the little lemon cake and they devoured it.  My salmon was perfectly cooked last time I was there.  I love their teas, specially the acai hibiscus one, can't wait to try the lemonades.

I love the Target at Desert Ridge.  It is big and roomy, I can check out the isles without bumping into other carts.  What I love the most is the sales after any Holiday.  Finding a great bargain for next year is a thrill, like my Olympics.  This one puts things on sale a lot faster.  They had the Halloween items at 70% off, when the other Targets had them at 50% off.  Yes, I go to almost all Targets in Scottsdale/Desert Ridge area.  Actually, I should say all, I don't think I have missed any.  Can't wait for my after Christmas shopping, I need to prepare and decide my theme for next year.  This year is going to be all red and white, yes I got everything last year in those colors.

This is a great option, specially when my husband brings the kids and I have an afternoon to myself, hahaha.  The kids get to climb around and play for hours.  Even after three hours, they didn't want to leave.  They have new ownership and it seems that they have done some improvement.  I really like the way they make sure everyone in the party has an armband, so no one can leave with your kid.  Too bad it is 30 miles away from home, otherwise I would be sending the hubby there more often.

I started training with Mark in May.  He is very knowledgeable and has a great motivating style.   He pushes you, without the Jillian Michaels style, so I did better than I thought.   He helped me keep on track with my goals.  This is a serious gym if you want results.  They focus on your goals and design a workout and meal suggestions tailored to you.  If you are looking for real results and you are at a lost where to start, you should give them a try, you won't regret it.

Very nice place in the same plaza as the AJ's.  I have been there twice now with my girlfriend, she was in town in between her many travels and was treating me to a pedi.  We got the spa pedicure, which includes callous removal and scrub at $35 it is a fair price.  The leg massage was very nice.  I will have this as my new spot since they are so close to my home.

My girlfriend wanted to celebrate her 20th wedding anniversary with her girlfriends, since her husband was out of town (she didn't know he had a surprise party planned for the weekend).  She asked me for some recommendations and I sent her an e-mail with some options.  I was happy when she chose SumoMaya, because I have been wanting to try it since it opened.  She booked a table for us, and it was the day of the big monsoon.  Since my babysitter cancelled on me, I had to drive myself, so my hubby had to stay with the twins and couldn't be my designated driver.  We had a nice table at the edge of the patio area.  It was pretty covered.  The restaurant is beautiful.  I got there and most of my friends were already there.  They had their cocktails in hand so I wanted to order one.  It took a little to get service, finally I was able to order the Lemongrass cocktail.  One of our friends arrived shortly after and it took another 10 minutes for her to be able to order her drink.  Finally, we all had our drinks, some were almost done with theirs, and we were able to toast our friend on her awesome anniversary.  We wanted to order food, again our server was near, but not looking at us, so I got up and asked her name, so I could call her next time.  Whitney finally took our food order.  We got a shrimp ceviche, really spicy but delicious.  I ordered the Rollo Chingon, a fusion sushi roll with adobo marinated grilled shrimp, guacamole, cilantro, jalapeño and red lotus root chips with a balsamic strawberry glaze.  It was amazing, I could live on it.  We also had the vietnamese style "shaking beef", it was terrific.  The chinese style chile-crab garlic noodles were excellent also.   The rain started again and the manager told us that if we started getting wet, we could move to a table behind us.  As the rain strengthen, we could feel the droplets falling on us.  We told Whitney we were getting wet and we wanted to move, she said "just scoot over".  I had to get up and call the manager and he indeed told her we could have that table.  It was after 9p.m.  It is not like anyone else was coming.  Once we sat on the new table we were ready for our dessert, everyone started to wonder where Whitney went, she was just by the bar, hanging out, so I got up again and asked the manager if we had a different server for the new table, since we had been there over 15 minutes and no one came.  He said Whitney was our server.  He sent her over and we placed our dessert order and some coffee requests.   This place is great and I docked a star because of the service, my friends were so upset, that I didn't argue when they wanted to leave only 10% for service.  I will definitely go again, but I will make sure not to get Whitney as my server.

This was my first time at Filmbar, I have been wanting to come and was on my bookmarks for over a year.  This was a fun event, I loved being able to chat with fellow yelpers and then enjoy an old movie.  It was so funny to watch again an old 80's movie.  Great acting, I guess that is why we never heard of them again.  It was a lot of fun to comment on some of the lines.  What a great and inventive event.  Short Leash truck was outside offering their yummy goods.  It was good to know they offered their dogs "naked" since I'm on a no carb diet right now. Thank you Lindsey and the staff at Filmbar for having us over to enjoy a night full of entertainment..

We drove all the way to Mesa for a birthday.  This place is 40-45 minutes away from our house.  It was well worth it!  The location is in the same plaza where the Movie theater is.  I was looking forward to having the hamburger and the fries, they were delicious.  I washed them down with the Lolli, a nice light beer.  I didn't realized until I was almost done with my second one, and after Scott W. told me the alcohol level, that they are strong.  Good thing I had a designated driver.  The service was great, we had a big group and everyone was taken care of.  I was so hungry that I wolfed my hamburger down and realized later they had forgotten the cheese.  They were so nice that they comp-ed us a dessert.  We got the bread pudding.  Oh my, it was so amazing.  I am not a fan of coffee desserts, except for tiramisu, but this cappuccino cream on top of the bread pudding was so fantastic I would have eaten a bucket of it.  It was the perfect ending to a fun night.  I would definitely drive again 45 minutes  to enjoy their food and beers.

The first time I tried a barre class a few years ago, was at another company and it was not what I expected.  When we had the opportunity to try Barre3, I was really excited, because this location is close to my home.  I was not disappointed.  I could feel my butt lifted after the end of the class.  There is a lot of leg and butt work and I loved it.  I was sore for 3 days, and I work out almost everyday.  I loved, loved, loved it.  I went this past Saturday for the 7:15 am class and I was impressed to see so many ladies at that time.  I will make sure to book the class next time I want to come to this one, although it was no problem at all. Can't wait to go back for some more.

What a fantastic event.  I was so impressed with everything they did for us.  They had a private room arranged with nice table settings, it was an intimate and classy event.  We were welcomed and started the wine tasting with the white wines and the fabulous chef Jennifer described each of the tastes she prepared for us.  I loved the scallops with the risotto, so delicious.  Then the red wines came with an assortment of beef tastings.  I loved them all.  Cannot decide which is my favorite.  I was so impressed that I texted my husband and we ended up having dinner there.  I needed more of the beef.  I am not a big beef eater, but I love when it is well prepared and they didn't disappoint.  Thank you, Lindsey and the entire staff at Capital Grill for hosting such a magnificent event.

What a disappointment!  We went to check it out, we sat at one end of the bar where it looks like a large communal table.  We had a margarita and a blueberry lemon drop.  Yuck, their well liquor must be the worst I have ever had. I imagine that is what gasoline would taste like.  We could not finish those drinks.  We decided to cut our loses and leave.

I love this kind of events.  We got to try a new (to me) workout experience.  It was a lot of fun working out along side some cool fellow yelpers.  I am glad I started with cardio.  The second part of the workout was weights so my legs were a little wobbly afterwards.  Following our workout, we were invited to enjoy a meal at Flower Child.  I love, love this concept.   I had the chopped vegetable salad with steak.  It was delicious.  I sampled a bite of the avocado humus, also amazing.  They sent us home with a delicious little cake, I heard that from my husband and kids since I am on a no carbs diet for the moment. Thank you to Lindsey for putting yet another wonderful event in coordination with  Orange Theory Fitness and Flower Child.

My new favorite.  I love cupcakes, and I love a good macaron, ...and cookies.  Who are we kidding?  I have a sweet tooth and love everything sweet.  I will indulge in any of them as long as the calories are worth it.  This place is worth it.  I love that they offer the mini cupcakes, it gives me the opportunity to try more flavors at once.  We stopped by and got the Oreo, Chocolate Salted Caramel, Strawberry and Vanilla.  I tasted the last three.  Amazing!  The cake was moist and the amount of frosting was perfect without being overwhelming.  I also had a raspberry macaron, loved it.  It had the crunchy crust and inside it was pillowy soft, so delicious.  The lemon cookie was also great.  I wish I had taken pictures, but this little piggy went to town on them.  I am sure I will be back, even though it is a trek for me.  I will find an excuse to be in that part of town.

Really nice event at The Venue is Old Town.  There was plenty of food and drinks.  I loved the samples from Hula's, Fogon and El Palacio.  I agree with the other yelper regarding having a water station.  It would have made the flow of the drinks much smoother.  The music was fun and people seem to be enjoying the party.  I also loved the olive oil booth, I ended up buying the pack of olive oils and balsamic vinegar.  I also got the lotion.  So amazing.

Sometimes I take the trip to go to this NR because it is never crowded.  I really dislike that the one in Scottsdale always has crazy lines and it feels so congested with racks and racks of clothes you cannot look through.  This one is much more peaceful and makes shopping a more pleasant experience.

Ok, I have a confession to make, I love hot dogs.  I don't eat them very often, because I LOVE hot dogs.  I have not had a hot dog in over three years, then I read about Lucky's and I wanted to check it out.  I have had two hot dogs in one week.  I feel so guilty, but they were so delicious.  I love that you can custom dress them the way you like.  Once they grill them, they hand them to you and you go to their "salad bar" type topping area.  The mayo free slaw was super yummy.  I also had the Paris Texas yams and the waffle fries.  Yes, I had a meal that required more than two hours at the gym, but it was well worth it.  My little boy wolfed down his hamburger.  They marinate the meat for 24 hours, so it is very flavorful.  I want to try the veggie burger, the way the owner described it, sounded so incredible appetizing.  She said it is her blend of quinoa, brown rice, yams and something else I don't remember.  When the kids are done eating, they get a free ice cream cone.   This kind of meal is an indulgence for me, and I am glad it is so close to my home.

Very nice family owned place.  Food is simple and well prepared.  I had the Eggplant Sorrentina, it was very good.  My husband had 1/2 eggplant parmigiana and 1/2 chicken parmigiana.  They were very nice to let him customize his order.  Also, for kids, they would do any dish for a half portion.  My little girl likes spaghetti with olive oil and parmesan cheese and my boy loves spaghetti with marinara.  I finished my meal with a delicious canoli.

Finally we have a nice modern italian restaurant in our neighborhood, yes, I would call it "modern" Italian because they don't offer your typical staples from the east coast.  There are several of those places around and if you want that then this is not your place.  The first time I came to this restaurant they had just opened, and there were a couple of hiccups, but I don't blame them, since this happens everywhere and they were more that happy to accommodate my twins, even though I usually don't bring my kids to restaurants that are this nice, I am always concerned about other people at a nice restaurant having a good experience, but that is just me (my kids are not horrible, they are just kids).  They made us a cheese pizza for them to our specifications, I had the pappardelle and my husband had the salciccia pizza.  My pappardelle were a little under done,  Our second experience, was a whole different picture, this time the restaurant was packed, I was happy to see that.  The level of noise is high, specially in the bar area, but not impossible to hear, unless you need a hearing aid I guess.  It had a very energetic vibe.  It seems that their busy time starts at 6:30p.m. and goes to 8:30pm on Saturdays.  We were lucky to find a high top at the bar around 6:40p.m.  By the time we left at 8:00, there were several people at the entrance waiting for tables. The cocktails look delicious,  I had a glass of red wine again, but I will try a cocktail next time. We started with the carpaccio and it was delicious, the beef was thinly sliced and it came with arugula and shaved parmesan.  My husband had another pizza and I decided to give the pappardelle another try, this time I specified to let them cook a little longer.  They came perfectly cooked, and it was delicious.  We ended our meal with Torta de la Nonna, a delicious cake, and coffee.  Service during this time will be a little slower, so if you are in a hurry, come at another time.  If you are vegetarian, go to a vegetarian place, I don't go to a vegetarian place and ripped them a new one, because as an omnivore I think their food taste like paste.

Thank you Norm R. for your great recommendation.  When I read your review, I bookmarked it immediately.  Since then, I have been craving a banh mi.  Finally, today I had an opportunity to have lunch with my husband, so I suggested this place to him.  He loves asian fare, so he was thrilled.  We drove the 21 miles it took to get there.  The place is in a strip mall that has several other restaurants.  Upon entering, I noticed how clean it is.  It also looks fairly modern.  The people working there were very welcoming.  I ordered the grilled chicken banh mi and my husband had the Shaken Beef banh mi.  The prices are very reasonable, mine was $5 and my hubby's was the most expensive banh mi at $7.  I loved my choice, the baguette was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside, the chicken was nicely seasoned and it came with onions, cilantro and some other veggies. I almost think I liked my husband's sandwich better, but cannot decide yet.  This place is sure worth the drive, we want to try the bowls of vermicelli noodles next time as well as the dessert.  I might have to share my sandwich next time, because it is pretty long, at least a foot long. P.S. I went back a couple of days later and had the Pork Banh mi and the Bun, a noodle and veggies salad bowl with chicken and shrimp, it was awesome.

It is time I write this review, I cannot come to Desert Ridge Marketplace without stopping here.  Then I wonder why I have gained weight.  I cannot have only one, it is impossible to choose, but here are a few of my favorite: Rose, so deliciously floral, by far my favorite.  Passion Fruit, tart and sweet with intense passion fruit flavor, excellent.  Blueberry lavender, the flavor is unique and delicate, their macarons are a perfect size and texture, slight crunch once you bite and soft and creamy inside.  I have also had the Orange blossom, salted caramel, coconut and pistachio.  My new guilty pleasure, I buy a box of six and take it with me to the movies, and I don't share.  I told my husband last time, if he wanted some, he needs to get his own box.  Yes, they are so good, I cannot stop, I eat the six of them within the first half hour of the movie.  And then I want to get six more when I get out, thank goodness I've been going late to the movies, so by the time we get out Paris Gourmet is closed.   I guess I need to space out my movie going experience if I don't want to start rolling in there.

When I saw they opened a BFG here in PHX, it brought great memories.  I used to go to the one in Tampa and St. Petersburg in FL all the time.  I love the chilean sea bass with the mango salsa.   We finally were able to go during HH on a Sunday and we had a great time.  The restaurant is a lot nicer than the ones in FL, really nice modern design.  We sat in the bar area in one of the booths.  The house chardonnay is pretty good, unoaked, light and at $3.25 during HH is a deal.  I had the special on this visit.  It was grilled salmon with choice of sauce (of course I chose the mango salsa) and mushroom ravioli and grilled veggies.  It was delicious.  Since the hubby doesn't like salmon, I got to eat the whole thing by myself.  My husband had the bang, bang shrimp tacos, they were three of them and larger than street tacos, so they were filling.  For dessert I had the key lime pie.   On our second visit my husband had the same and I had the blackened fish tacos.  For my side I chose the couscous and my hubby the asian slaw.  So far we have had a great experience and the size of the meals where more than enough to fill you up.  Second time I didn't get a dessert, I was too full.

I love this place.  It is in the middle of Old Town craziness without being overwhelming.  It is not too busy, of course I go there a lot earlier than the young people who party around that area.  Maybe that is why it was fairly quiet.  The prices are very reasonable.  Cocktails are $9 and during HH they are $7.  That is very reasonable for Scottsdale.  Tommy is fantastic, he is not a bartender, he is really a mixologist.  He asked me what I liked and he made me a wonderful gin cocktail, it was delicious.  My husband had a custom spicy margarita, also amazing.  We snacked on the beef skewers and the chicken satay.  The beef was my favorite.  I will have to try other items next time.  The shrimp one sounded so good.  The decor is modern and clean looking.  I liked the outside patio furniture.  I would have hanged out there, but the misters were going full blast and the night was a little mild for this time of year.  Can't wait to go back.

I love coming to see  Olivia, she is very talented.  My hair is really long right now and it is hard for me to blow it out by myself, my arm is not that long.  I love that they offer "happy hour" on blowouts.  Everyday, between 4 and 6 you can get a blowout for $20, how awesome is that.  She also does awesome braids,  she did 3 fishtail braids for a 4th of July party I had and then the other day she did what my kids called "an Elsa braid", yes my hair is that long.  The other advantage I have is that they are so close to my house, they are on the same plaza as Mastro's.

I bought I Groupon to check this place out.  I made my appointment and it was very easy.  Once I got there, I filled out some paperwork and Kelley took me back to the room to do my waxing.  I forgot to take an ibuprofen, so I was a little nervous.  Kelley was very professional and my waxing went pretty fast and not incredibly painful, for the area.  When she completed the work, she checked me out and I was offered the same deal if I booked within 2 months, of course I made my appointment.  I will be there in January.

This is a really cool brewery.  We went with our monthly brews crew.  This time we had a really small group which worked well since we could only get a small table.  Since they  don't offer food, they let you bring in your own.  They do have a popcorn machine for free snacking.  That Saturday they also had life entertainment.  A singer with a guitar was performing really cool songs.  This place had great beers, this was the first time I ordered a flight, because I noticed they had several beers I might like.  my flight was of Poolside Pilsner, SMASHED Lager, Say John! Saison, Desert Rose, Worth the Wit Witbier.  My favorite was the Poolside Pilsner, I ended up getting a can of it, they will put the beer in the can in front of you and then seal the can, it is so cool. You can also get growlers, but I think I want to go back and order cans so I can see them seal them with the machine; simple entertainment.

I read a review really early on Sunday and then I saw the pictures of the donuts.  I had to try them.  I asked the kids "who wants donuts?"  Of course, I got them all riled up, it almost seemed I had sugared them up already.  So I pack everyone in the car and we drove 22 miles to get donuts.  My little girl wanted the donut with the pink frosting and sprinkles.  My boy had the chocolate cake donut with chocolate frosting.  I had a cronut and my husband had a banana fritter.  We inhaled them, so we decided for round two.  I had a maple glazed and shared a croissant with my husband and my little girl had a white frosting with sprinkles this time.  We also took a 1/2 dozen donuts home, just in case we needed a little pick me up later that day.  The owners are really sweet and the donuts and croissants are amazing.  By the way, my husband also took a turkey and cheese stuffed croissant as his snack for the airport.  Can't wait to make that 44 miles roundtrip trek again.

I still consider myself new to beers.  We came here with a group.  The place is small and the sign is not very noticeable.  You blink and you miss it, and so did we; we had to go around the block and try again and found a parking spot.  It is in a small almost craftsman style home.  Everyone loved their beers.  I only tried one and it was really nice.  I don't remember the name, because I asked the owner?? what he would recommend to someone who drinks lighter beers.  He served me one that was perfect.  They offer some panini from Noble Eatery, but you can also bring your own.  We ended up bringing some calzone from a nearby place.  Too bad it is really far for us, but if I am in the area, I will definitely come back.

Of course I had to go inside and try their goodies.  I have actually gone in there more than once.  Last time I was there, they had violet gelato,  I love weird flavors.  Their macarons are good, but I prefer the ones from another place, but if I am in this part of town I am not going to deny my sweet tooth.  Their chocolates are also very tasty.  My husband said that the coffee gelato has the best coffee flavor he has had anywhere in town.  I have to take his word for it, since I don't do cold coffee in any form.  The place is very nice, and spacious.

I'm so excited Zoës is closer to me now. Today is the grand opening and it was a little busy around noon, but it was flowing nicely. They are giving away cups for your drink and you can get free refills for the month. I ordered the chicken kabob with the Greek salad and a side of quinoa (new item) it was good!  I also had a side of the hummus. Can't wait to come back.

I was so happy when they opened a location near me.  Yay, breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.  The place is smaller than the one in Town & Country, but if you go early the wait is almost none existent.  I have had several of their bennys, pancakes and mimosas.  I love that they let you choose half of a benny and half of a pancake order.  This last visit, I had the chilaquiles benny, my go to pancake, the sweet potato pancake and a pineapple mimosa.  My husband had the breakfast tacos. Most of their "breakfast" cocktails are great, but they are strong.   Such a delicious meal, can't wait to come back

One of my new favorite spots to see a movie.  The terrace alone is worth visiting, specially during this time of year when the weather is sooooo beautiful.  The first time we came here was last December, just after Christmas.  The whole family came to see Star Wars (of course!) The kids loved the reclining seats, they even brought their blankets from home.   This week, my husband and I decided to come see Spotlight, which had been on my list for a while, but after the Oscar win, I couldn't just wait for the dvd.  Since it had been out for a while, I decided to skip the online purchase.  We got there just 10 minutes before the start of the previous and there were plenty of the good seats available.  Really, I don't think there are any bad seats anymore, since they have all reclining big seats.  We ordered some wine and margaritas and an artisanal plate.  This is a great way to watch movies, so civilized.  It is a little bit of a drive for me 23 miles each way, but well worth it.  Now, if only they would convert their Scottsdale 101 location...

My favorite movie theater now.  I love the remodel.  They have huge lazy boy type chairs that recline all the way.  The other plus, you can reserve your seats now.  That is an awesome feature, no more getting 45 minutes before a show to get a good seat.  I can buy my tickets online and go to the movies just in time to watch the previous.  Yes, there are fewer seats, but definitely soooooo much more comfortable.

This place is the real deal.  I saw a couple of reviews and the pictures were calling my name.  I put on my yoga pants, got the kids in the car and drove 21 miles to get donuts.  While in line, we got a free fresh glazed donut, YUM, warm, soft and sweet.  So delicious.  We had to try several. My little boy wanted a raised with chocolate glaze and my little girl wanted the raised with pink glaze and sprinkles.  I got a croissant donut, a maple bar, a creme brûlée donut, an almond croissant and a salted caramel one.  That one came last, because they were still finishing them.  When they brought it to me, it was warm and so delicious.  I was glad to have planned ahead and wore yoga pants.  This place is worth the drive and the calories.
