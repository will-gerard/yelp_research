This review is based solely on the market, since I haven't actually ordered food here. That being said, La Tolteca rocks.  There's a Christmas tradition that I partake of, and it causes me all sorts of problems.  Every year I cater a holiday party, and every year I'm scrambling to get my preparations done.  This year I needed some butt.  Pork butt to be exact.  Not being satisfied with what I found at the grocery store and being in need of some Mexican spices I turned to La Tolteca.  I was not disappointed.  The butcher counter has a small but excellent selection.  You haven't lived until you see a window full of cow tongue!  The butcher was great and the prices were beyond reasonable.  I'll definitely return to La Tolteca, and next time I'll actually eat there.

I think I was spoiled growing up.   I used to live ten minutes away from the best Chinese food restaurant I've ever eaten at. I've traveled far and wide and still nothing matches my home grown favorite. Alas, the ten minute drive would now be a two hour drive.   Since moving to Phoenix I've been on the lookout for good hot and sour soup. On the advice from Iain B, I decided to give gourmet House of Hong Kong a try.   I've driven past this restaurant many, many times and never once did I think about stopping. The neighborhood isn't what I'd call inviting and the building itself doesn't exactly say, 'Eat here!' Nevertheless, I had faith in Iain and would see this thing through.   The menu is huge, like maybe a hundred items deep. Sifting through all of the choices it was nice to see all the usual suspects, but some relatively unique dishes as well.   Though I came here specifically for hot and sour soup, there were so many enticing options I decided to get a little crazy.   Takeout Order:   -Crab Puffs  -Mixed Veggie and Wonton Soup  -Curry Beef Stew and Noodle Soup  -Wunan Beef  -Sweet and Sour Chicken   Total: Around 25 bucks!   Fifteen minutes later I was able to sample the food from the comfort of my home and WOW! This place is legit! For the price I would have been pleased with adequate food, but each item really blew me away.   The crab puffs were more crab meat than cream cheese, with great flavor. The Curry Beef stew was amazing, with an excellent flavor (they actually put this in two containers, one for the beef and noodles with one for the broth. Nice touch!). The Wunan beef had just the right amount of fire to it, and was just plain delicious.   I'm already planning my next trip to Gourmet House of Hong Kong. The quality of food is truly amazing for the price.   Oh, and next time I'll get the hot and sour soup.

Finally!  The last two times I've gone to CherryBlossom the service as been great.  The food is still wonderful, especially the TanTan-Men, a spicy ramen dish with minced pork.  Just the right amount of heat with perfectly cooked noodles.

It's weird. I'm experiencing something I never have before. Towards the end of my work day I start thinking about going home. I'm not thinking about leaving work, rather actually going HOME. Fountains in the Green, I think I love you. At the very least I want to make out with you.   Hidden under a wild mass of green lies a unique apartment complex. The place is not new, what some might call 'historic.' The apartments are solid as hell. Not once have I been able to hear my neighbors through he walls.   The Good:  -A wide variety of floor plans  -The apartments are huge  -Office/maintenence staff rock  -Gigantic freaking courtyards for ground level units. Really, really big  -Utilities included (and basic cable). This saves a nice fat chunk of change during the summer  -The surrounding neighborhood is actually quite nice. It's relaxing to take the dog on a long walk through through.  -Did I mention a big ass courtyard?   The Not-so-Good:  -Due to the lush landscaping there are a fair number of roaches. Now, they spray and do a great job of it, but expect to pick at least a few dead roaches up each week. I have yet to find a live bug inside.  -Parking for residents is kind of tight, and big trucks seem to be strategically placed to make getting around corners difficult (I'm looking at you silver Titan!)  -If you're visiting a resident you park on the street. You can request a spot inside the grounds on an as needed basis.   The Bad:  -There is an evil ass striped cat that wears a pink collar. Don't be fooled by the collar, this cat is crazed and dogicidal. I've had this tabby terror stalk my enthusiastically stupid dog on more than one occasion. I'm a dog person, so I hate you, pink collared cat.   So yes, every day when I walk into my large apartment, a sense of peace comes over me. I'm home and I'm happy

I've noticed that as my solidly senior parents get older their taste in food gets pickier.  Due to this, every time I decide to treat them to a meal, I really have to put a ton of thought into it.  I've struck out many times, but hit one out of the field with Phoenix City Grille.  Goat cheese toasts started the show.  The cheese was delicious, with the sun dried tomatoes really giving some depth  Entrees ordered were the pot roast, pasta and an amazing porkchop special.  The pot roast was exactly what I craved, dare I say needed.  It took all the self control I could muster to save some for leftovers (Pot roast sandwich the next day, of course).  The chop was devoured in a frenzy by my normally mellow dad, while my mom eagerly sopped up the pasta sauce.  I still tend to over think meal planning with the family, thankfully Phoenix City Grille has given me a solid option.

Impulse shopping for electronic equipment is a horrible habit to have.  Sadly, it's a habit I can't kick.  It starts off as a tiny nagging thought in my head.  "I'd go to the gym more if I had an MP3 player."  Now, this being a perfectly reasonable thought, I head off to Best Buy.  The trouble starts when I actually walk through the doors.  My iPod was the gateway drug and Best Buy was dealing.  Over the last several months I've purchased home networking devices, home entertainment stuff, computer hardware and a whole mess of movies.  The sales crew has been competent and able to answer the few questions that I had.  The prices for big ticket items are adequate bordering on good, depending on sales.  Movies aren't cheap, but the selection is great.    Though there are better bargains out there, Best Buy will always be my go to spot for must have items.  Damn enablers...

I love my dog, and as such I'd like it if he didn't die soon.  Unfortunately for him the things that will keep him healthy are usually the things that terrify the bejeezus out of him.  I need a vet with a deft hand and a kindly bed (or table?) side manner.  I found this at Animal Care Hospital.  Both the vet and the tech were very professional and friendly.  The vaccinations went fast, with nary a flinch from my poor little pup.  All in all it was a good experience.

As I get older I'd like to think that my tastes are becoming more refined. That is to say, rather than having a poster tacked to the wall, I now prefer that said poster is framed.   After spending a whopping ten bucks on two original photos I decided that I needed some custom framing done. Thanks to Yelp I found Framin' Works.   The shop itself is a large open space with many works in progress. Alan, the proprietor, clearly knows his business. I explained what I had in mind and in no time at all I had several samples laid out. It was a painless process. I left with the understanding that he'd call when my frames were done.   Several weeks later I got a very apologetic call from Alan. It would seem that while he was on vacation some of the workload fell behind. It wasn't a big deal and my photos were beautifully framed.   My only dilemma now is that, though I intended to hang the photos in the bathroom, they look too good for that.

As of late part of my Saturday morning ritual has been to stop off at Home Depot. I have a decent sized back yard that was just screaming for a few upgrades.   My first trip I was in search of a gas grill. The associate that was helping me was super enthusiastic! She totally got in to the hunt for the perfect grill. She was also kind enough to help me carry my treasure trove to the return counter for checkout, since I was parked on that end of the lot. The customer service was excellent.   For the past several weekends I've needed odds and ends for the container garden I've begun. The potting soil, plants and pots are all very reasonably priced. Another win for me is that the three plants I bought at Home Depot (cucumber, Thai chili and habenero) are alive and flourishing. Anyone that has ever bought a plant from a big box retailer will understand how nice this is.   So, great customer service coupled with excellent and reasonably priced selection? See ya next Saturday, Home Depot!

I like veggies but I don't like buying them. Following this simplistic logic trail I decided to plant a garden. Since I don't know a damn thing about gardening I sought out some professional help. To the Baker Nursery!   I could easily spend an entire day wandering through the nursery. The place is huge, with an amazing assortment of indoor and outdoor plants, flowers, trees and veggies.  The quality of everything was great, everything was healthy and well tended.  The vegetable selection is fairly extensive and very reasonably priced. In no time at all I had the beginnings of a nice little garden picked out. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, answering the questions that I had.   The garden is really coming along, I picked my very first strawberry yesterday. Thank you Baker Nursery!

It's better than nothing.   If you work in the area (16th and Morton) and have a limited amount of time for lunch, or if you didn't have time to eat breakfast in the morning the Veranda Bistro is for you. You will be completely not-excited-but-not-disappointed by this exactly as expected food.   The breakfast menu is essentially 4 ingredients (egg, meat, cheese, starch) served in several varieties. They all pretty much taste the same. One warning, the home fries are typically undercooked. The eggs have an amazing characteristic, that being the ability to crumble into a pile of bits too tiny to be picked up with a fork. I sense some breakfast fairy magic at play.   Lunchtime is a bit better, with several sandwich options, both cold and hot. There are salads and soup, and a variety of deep fried snacks. I've eaten a few of the cold sandwiches, and they are moderately tasty. The salads are premade and sitting in a cooler, which makes for some drippy lettuce.   Speaking of lettuce, I would love to meet the monster that's strong enough to cram THAT MUCH lettuce into one container. I'm not exaggerating when I say I pulled off enough lettuce to make two more salads of equal size. No one in this world needs that much lettuce in one sitting.   Veranda Bistro serves a valuable purpose and is blessed with a great location. It's the only restaurant within walking distance for a few thousand people. I only wish that they tried a little harder rather than delivering exactly what I expected. Curse my low expectations!

Since quitting smoking my coffee intake dropped off for several years, due to the powerful association between the two.   It's only recently that I've felt like I could enjoy a cuppa Joe without wanting to suck on a lung rocket. Enter Starbucks, the only conveniently located coffee shop on my way to work.   Starbucks are pretty much all the same when it comes to delivering decent, consistent coffee. This location is no exception.   What really impressed me was the excellent customer service. On my very first visit I ordered my drink then immediately realized that I had left my wallet at home. The cashier didn't even blink, he just told me not to worry about it, they'd cover it. For a regular customer this would be great service, but for a first time visitor? Good stuff.   While not an every day thing, I will definitely be stopping in once or twice a week. Thanks Starbucks!

I had some hope for this place.  It was clean and smelled good.  It's essentially Panda Express and the prices are reasonable.  For a quick lunch I got some Lo Mien with Beef & Broccoli and Kung Pao Chicken.  The food tasted exactly as I would have expected, kind of bland.  I ate about half of the meal and tossed the rest in the fridge for later.  Two hours later I felt something, something dark and painful.  This stuff RIPPED my stomach up.  Being at work, this made for some awkward meetings, that's for sure.  It could be that I have a delicate stomach, but I don't think I'd chance it again.

I like to go to the gym at lunch.  It's really the best time for me.    Having recently changed employers I was forced to find a new gym that was within a few minutes from the office.  Sadly, the only real choice is LA Fitness.  The place just isn't that nice.  It's not one particular thing, it's a whole lot of little things put together.  Imagine walking into a house with stained furniture and a faint, unpleasant smell.  That's how I feel every time I walk in.  Smell and atmosphere aside this location isn't very busy during the lunch hours.  I rarely have to wait for a machine so I can get in, work out and leave.  This alone is worth a star or two.  It's a sad day when I have to force myself to go to the gym, not because I'm lazy, but because I don't really care for the gym.

A long time (four months) ago, before I moved to Phoenix, I would drive up I-17 and wonder what the ugly building on my left was.  Little did I know that it would be one of my go-to spots for a quick lunch!  I've always appreciated  the no frills simplicity of Souper Salad and this particular location is no exception.  The salad bar has always been fresh for me, the rotating soup selection is quite good and the bread is tasty.  Heck, even the pizza is decent.  What really makes Souper Salad shine for me are the deals!  Tuesdays are two for one and there are almost always coupons for similar deals.  I can't remember the last time I paid full price.  It's not fancy and it's not pretty, but the food and pricing are good.  I'll keep going to Souper Salad as long as I work in the area.

I've held off writing a review of Elements simply because I've never actually eaten off the house menu. This review is based on the sheer awesomeness of how Executive Chef Beau Macmillan runs the place and the amazing opportunities that he provides.   During the summer Elements hosts a Lunch and Learn, where they bring in top notch chefs from around the valley, as well as celebrity chefs like Robert Irvine.   I attended a Lunch and Learn event hosted by Geoffrey Zakarian, judge on Chopped and all around groovy guy. Over the course of several hours he whipped up three amazing courses (with wine pairings), demonstrating how to make each dish and answering questions. the atmosphere was relaxed and fun. Chef Macmillan was also there to answer questions and make jokes as well. What an amazing day!   While at the lunch I made reservations for another event, the Table for 12 dinner. Essentially 12 people dine in a private room that is directly off the kitchen, with only a few glass doors separating you from the chaos. the chef of the evening was Petite Maisons' own James Porter.   I'm not exaggerating when I say this was the most enjoyable dining experience of my life. The setting was intimate, Chefs Macmillan and Porter were on hand to discuss the courses, food in general and any other topic came up. The passion that they feel for food really came through.   The food was amazing, the wine was perfect and the company could not be beat. Hanging out in The Jade bar afterwards with the staff was entertaining and educational (thanks David for the taco shop suggestions!).   I'm completely blown away that Elements provides such amazing experiences. Based on this experience I will definitely return to Elements, and I'm headed for Petite Maison.   Truly amazing

What a dump.  My recent experience at the Marquee Theatre was essentially like every other reviewers.  -Slow security with bad attitudes -Take my shoes off?  Really? -Weak, overpriced drinks -Dirty nasty venue -Rude ass police outside -Just plain trashy  In the immortal words of Danny Glover, "I'm getting to old for this $h*t."

I'm not a baseball fan, but even I can appreciate the excitement of a live game.  I've attended a few games, as well as experiencing the mother of all holiday parties at Chase, and I've been pleased every time.  The facilities are clean, the AC is cool and the food and drink selection is perfect.  Bonus for Chase being mere minutes from home!

On a recent Sunday, on my way to get brunch at a downtown eatery, I had a horrible realization.  My restaurant didn't open until 10:30, and it was only 10:00.  I couldn't wait, I needed food STAT!  And then I saw Fez.  I ordered a G-Spot (drink), which is appropriately named.  Light and fizzy, it was delicious.  Not in the mood for breakfast foods I ordered a Balsamic Blue cheese burger with spicy fries.  In no time at all I had a beautiful plate of food in front of me.  The burger was perfectly cooked and delicious.  Even with strong flavors like Blue cheese and Balsamic glaze the flavor of the beef stole the show. The fries were messy and wonderful, chock full of spicy goodness.  I felt no shame for the spice stain that surrounded my mouth.  The fries came with a garlic aoli that perfectly balanced out the flavors.  Since that first fateful visit Fez has slowly taken over as my brunch spot of choice.  I'm ok with that.

This place is ass...   Some friends of mine were coming into town to see a specific DJ so I decided to meet them. If I had known what Axis Radius was like I would have stayed home.   This place must have rocked 15 years ago but now it just seems kind of sad. I'd describe the atmosphere but to be honest there wasn't any. If despair is a theme then Axis Radius nails it.   The crowd was an awkward hodgepodge of drunks, out to pasture party boys and desperate women.   The drinks were pricey but strong and the go-go dancers were definitely easy on the eyes, hence the two star rating.   Maybe it's my fault for going. It could be that I'm not the right sort of person to go to Axis Radius. If so, I'm totally ok with that.

Hoo-boy, did I feel like an idiot.  I've been wanting to try Dick's Hideaway for some time now, being a lover of New Mexican cuisine.  My main stumbling block was not knowing where the hell it is.  After circling the intersection several times and cursing my GPS I finally decided to park and wander around.  It's a good thing I did!  After walking past the unassuming doors a few times (hence the idiot feelings) I finally saw the tiny menu stuck next to the storefront.  I cautiously went in.  The interior is small to the extreme, but very cozy and well appointed.  The bar area was completely full so I stood by the door in the hopes of finding a hostess or server.  Ten minutes passed and again I felt like an idiot.  Finally a kind server took pity on me and seated me at the public table.  From here on out everything went smooth as butter.  The menu was full of enticing food.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros Christmas style (red and green sauce).  The food was delivered quickly, and it was amazing.  The eggs were cooked to perfection and the beans were well flavored.  I didn't intend on eating the seasoned red potatoes, really I didn't.  They were so perfectly cooked that I couldn't resist.  The red and green sauces were exactly what I was craving, perfectly spiced.  Maybe there's a trick to Dick's Hideaway, a perfect time to come or a way to sneak a seat at the bar.  If I can solve the riddle you can bet I'll be back again and again.

When I look for a gym I'm really hoping for the following:   -Conveniently located (either by home or work)  -Decent mix of free weights and machines  -Not too crowded  -Reasonably priced   I've found a great match in Tocasierra. My employer has a corporate account with the center, which brings the price down to just under a dollar a day! You can't beat the price.   A decent range of classes are included in membership, from Yoga to Strength training. I haven't tried any classes yet, but I've heard that they're good.   The fitness center isn't big, but it's fairly complete. There are several cardio options, a full set of dumbbells and around ten machines. One other plus, they have an honest to god bench press. Machines just don't cut it. A pool is available as well. It's big enough to do laps in, so that's a plus.   Over the years I've found that one of the most relaxing things I can do is work out on my lunch break. I get my head straight for the rest of the day and I don't have to feel guilty about being lazy in the evening. Thanks to Tocasierra I can do this!   I should also mention that the staff is very friendly and helpful. Good stuff.

In my continued quest to find a good dog park that is relatively close to home I was lucky enough to visit Chaparral Park.  So far, this park is the best I've been to in Phoenix.  Chaparral Park is what happens when you take everything you could do right with a dog park and lump it all together.  I'm a huge fan of splitting the dogs by active and passive.  It's genius.  The grass is great and there's just enough shade for comfort.  The sand area is great for tired dogs to cool off in.  My mutt can be a little bit of a snob sometimes, but I've been very impressed with how much he runs around at the park.  All the dogs and owners that I've encountered are very friendly, and not pretentious at all.  It's a good environment, far better than any I had while living in Tucson.  I've only visited on the weekend during the day.  The park was busy, with a nice mix of dogs.  I'm going to give the evening a shot tonight to see how it is.  This would be a 5 star review if I didn't have to drive 20 minutes to get there, but rest assured I'll be making that drive frequently.  Chaparral Park is dandy.

The Phoenix Public Market has become a Saturday morning tradition for me.  It's a very relaxing way to begin my day.  Having frequented farmers markets for years I'm quite impressed with how well put together the market is.  The stalls are easy to navigate, with plenty of shade for a hot morning.  There is a nice level of diversity to be found as well, from pickled veggies to grass fed beef.  Everything is high quality and reasonably priced.  The produce selection is good enough for me to get all of my fruits and veggies for the week.  Take that, Safeway!  Every week I find myself buying something new, usually on a whim.  All of the vendors are incredibly passionate about their products and it really shows in the quality.  If you're in the neighborhood do yourself a favor and drop in, you won't be disappointed.

I never really had sweet tooth.  Given the choice between a piece of cake or a pickle, the pickle wins every time.  Urban Cookies has changed me.  I've sampled just about every cupcake that's offered, and here are a few highlights:  The orange blossom cupcake is a delightful surprise, with subtle flavors and great texture.  My personal favorite.  The chocolate cupcake is the best chocolate thing I've ever eaten.  Think about that for just a second.  The BEST chocolate thing I've ever had.  The carrot cake cupcake reminds me of my childhood.  In a really good way.  The strawberry cupcake actually tastes like strawberries!  To sum up, Urban Cookies has made me appreciate the sweeter things in life.  Thank you.

All praise the mighty Groupon for introducing me to Hobe meats!   I'm not really into red meat, however, a recent Groupon for steaks piqued my interest. Having recently purchased a grill, the idea of having a cookout for family was very appealing. To the butcher shop I went.   Hobe is a meat mecca, a ballet of beef. Their selection is great, ranging from any cut of meat imaginable to fresh sausages. Bacon flirts from the corner and there's even a nice selection of seafood!   The butchers were incredibly friendly, and didn't bat an eye when presented with the Groupon. The gentleman selected the steaks, wrapped them accordingly and gave me some grilling tips. Excellent customer service was had.   All in all, everything I could want from a butcher shop was had at Hobe Meats. The steaks came out great!   (as a very important side-note: I've been looking for a place to buy duck breast for the last few months. Hobe has it! mmm, duck)

One of the the greatest joys in my life is to sneak away from work at lunch and lift heavy things until I'm ready to pass out.  To wit, I need a gym close to the office.  This gym is beautiful!  The equipment is well maintained, the locker rooms are clean and private showering is available.  Anyone that's been to LA Fitness will understand what a joy it is to not have saggy old man-bits smacking you in the head.  Gold's is open 24/7, which is very nice considering my somewhat sporadic schedule.  All things said, I'm very pleased with my new gym!

It's awful of me not to have updated this in a more timely fashion.  Simply put, Middle Eastern Bakery is fantastic.  Excellent food, great lemonade, superb market and low prices!  What really makes the place stand out is the service.  I'd like to share a recent experience I had.  After ordering some take out, I struck up a conversation with the owner, who was eating breakfast.  We discussed the various types of feta available, and which kind was best.  This guy, the owner, sliced off a piece of cheese from his own breakfast and gave me a sample.  That's right, he feels so strongly about his goods that he was willing to share his breakfast.  I love this shop and only wish that the hours of operation were more in line with my schedule.

One of the few downsides to accepting a job in Scottsdale was that I would no longer be near my favorite barber shop.  I needed to find a new head-shaving spot fast.  Goodfellas is a great shop, with talented barbers.  I really like how the barber stations are laid out, it's very cozy.  Being a minute from the office is a plus as well.  This is a manly shop for manly men like me.  They sell cigars.  If they had a scotch bar I'd probably move in.  Bottom line, I've found my North Scottsdale barber shop.

My dog is an evil, energetic creature. He's vindictive and calculating. As such, I try to keep him too occupied to plot my death.   I need a dog park.   I've enjoyed going to Washington park, but the drive has proved to be a bit too much for me. Imagine my surprise when I found out that they recently upgraded the dog park at Indian School park!   The new park is located off the 7th street park entrance, just north of Indian School. It's wonderfully landscaped, with plenty of grass and trees. They're actually in the process of building the big dog park, so right now the park is shared. Thus far I've only encountered friendly and responsible owners, so there haven't been any issues.   Unfortunately there are two issues with the park. There are no water fountains inside the park, requiring you to bring your own. Also, the lighting kind of sucks, so if the lights from the football field aren't on it will be fairly dark at night.   Regardless of the drawbacks, I'm happy to have found a new place to run the beast.  If you live in the neighborhood, please come by!

Fresh & Easy surprised me.  They don't have the biggest selection, but what they do have is well thought out and very well priced.  It would seem that FE caters to single person/ small family households, which is great.  Their premade food is tasty, and the soups are awesome.  I am constantly shocked at how cheap meat is here.  My freezer is stocked full of chops and chicken, at about half the cost of what I would pay elsewhere.  You can't get all your shopping done at FE, but it's an enjoyable experience and the stuff you can get is top notch and bottom dollar.  I'm a fan

I am a horrible person for not writing this review a month ago. I blame the holidays.   I've gotten dinner for myself a few times at D'licious Dishes and each time the food has been superb. You can see the love that goes into the food. I've never seen a takeout place to equal this.   D'licious Dishes did something amazing; They saved Thanksgiving for me!   I had planned to host the family celebration this year since I have family in both Flagstaff and Tucson (hooray for being in the middle!). A few days prior to the holiday my sister found out that she had to work Thanksgiving evening. Now, when it comes to cooking for a crowd I'm more than a little insane about planning and timelines. This screwed everything up.   Rather than spend the entire time cooking I opted for the lazy way out. I would order out, allowing me to spend some quality time with the family. Enter D'licious Dishes.   The Thanksgiving menu was wonderful and reasonably priced. I ordered a half turkey breast, a pork tenderloin, garlic 'taters, sweet potatoes, kale, stuffing and gravy and those wonderful green beans.   The staff is amazing. They walked me through my order and didn't bat an eye when I came back a few days later to add on a few items. The day before Thanksgiving the food was packed and ready to go, along with details on how best to cook everything.   My family and I loved every dish. In all honesty it was one of the most relaxed and pleasant Thanksgiving days that I've ever had.   I think that D'licious Dishes may become a Thanksgiving tradition for me.   Thank you!

One of the most important things in life is to live no more than a minute away from great Mexican fast food. I'm blessed to have America's Taco Shop fulfill that need.   'Berto's beware, I'll never frequent you again thanks to the amazing Carne Asada at America's. The meat is freakishly tender and cooked to perfection. The grilled onions are the Cher to the meats' Sunny. Simply put, the Carne Asada burrito is damn good!   The corn is a delight as well. I despise mayo and yet I still can't get past ordering the corn. Lightly coated in mayo then shellacked in cheese, with a spritz of lime and Cholula, the corn is to die (or kill) for.   You'd think that two noteworthy items like these would be enough but NO! The true star of the shop is the beans. Light and flavorful they set the standard for beans everywhere.   My sister is a little bit of a dirty redneck. When I mentioned that the beans were lard free she scoffed. I hate scoffing so I demanded that she try them. An hour later she was convinced, and properly apologetic. Thank you America's for giving me the rare win over a dirty redneck.   America's is a great little shop in central Phoenix, and one that I will continue to frequent. Thanks for existing!   NOTE: During peak hours the parking lot can be a little scary. You've been warned.

If Walmart had existed in the 14th century, Dante Alighieri would almost certainly have used it as a template for one of the layers of hell.   If I were to grade Walmart based upon products carried and pricing it would probably be a solid 3 stars. One cannot, however, ignore the other pieces to this puzzle.   The lines - Checking out always takes longer than the actual shopping.  The people - There are some skeevy people shopping at the 'Mart.  The crushing sense of despair - I feel it.   The unfortunate fact about Walmart is that there are times when my only viable option is to shop there, like when I need little propane tanks on the way home from work. I'm not proud of it, but it happens.   Avoid it if you can, but if you can't just remember to bathe once you get home.

What a snazzy little joint.  On a recent night out I found myself at The Turf.  The ambiance was great, with plenty of dark wood and metal.  The food that I sampled was quite tasty, though I admit ti sticking with standard bar fare.  The menu had tons of interesting options, enough for me to consider coming back to sample.  The Turf also boasts an excellent liquor list as well!  The bourbon list alone was drool inducing.  I'm not really up to speed on downtown nightlife, but The Turf will always be an option as a place to pass the night.

I really wanted to love Luci's. Sadly, I did not.   My parents are old, really old. Due to their chronic old-ness, they tend to have inflexible habits. Since I am not old, I don't share many of these routines.   They like coffee, I drink tea. They need dessert whereas I don't eat sweets. On a recent weekend visit I decided to side step some of these issues by taking them to Luci's for dessert and coffee.   Between the three of us we ordered three 12 ounce coffees, one cinnamon roll and two pieces of an apple tart. Total bill? $23 bucks... Ah well, I thought, you pay for quality.   right?   No. The cinnamon roll looked and tasted exactly like the deadly square things you can get at any convenience store. Even heated the frosting didn't loosen up, rather it kept its glue like consistency.   The apple tart looked magnificent, however the flavor was severely lacking. The taste was like a fleeting thought of apple, as if I was remembering a good slice of pie.   The coffee was simply OK, nothing great.   I love the open feel to Luci's, and the patio area is great. The lunch menu has some very interesting options that I will come back to try.   As I gazed longingly at the Starbucks across the street I realized that maybe, just maybe, my parents were on to something. If you don't try new things you probably won't be disappointed.

In need of a location between Tucson and Phoenix for a birthday dinner I turned to Yelp. Would I find something fun and tasty in Casa Grande? Yes, yes I would.   Picazzo's ambiance would stand up in any major city. It's clean, the art is funky and fun, and the lighting is perfect. All of this pales in comparison to the food and service.   This is an upscale pizza place with a large gluten-free menu. They have pasta, salads to go with the pies. Local, organic and sustainable ingredients are used.   My guest and I split a Greek salad and a pesto artichoke pizza. They have their salads in three sizes, which I think is a nice touch. Being hungry we ordered the medium to split. for two people this is far too much food. Stick with the small.   The salad was delicious! Olives peeked out everywhere, pepperoncini slices were included along with some incredible feta. I could have made a meal out of the salad alone. Then the pizza arrived.   Damn! What a tasty pie! the toppings were such that it almost needed to be eaten with a knife and fork. The pesto was delicious, and there were tons of pine nuts as well. We got a side of marinara sauce just to try it and it was heavenly.   Dessert consisted of a giant, oven baked cookie topped with ice cream. Did I need it? Nope. Did I want it? Of course!   Our server was perfect, plain and simple. He did everything right.   I now have a go-to spot in Casa Grande.

Looking for good lunch spots close to work can be a tricky thing.  Sometimes I randomly stop at a place simply because it's convenient.  Such was the case with Panini Cafe.  I drive past Panini every day on my way home from work and never once was I tempted to try it.  Located in a strip mall it really didn't look like much.  Luckily Panini Cafe is far more than meets the eye.  The interior is simple and clean, nothing too amazing.  It's the food that really makes an impression.    The menu makes me chuckle a little, due to what some would consider to be misleading item names.  A 'gyro' here is not what you'd expect.  This is Bosnian food and it's delicious.  I ordered a meat and onion 'pita.'  I paid a little over six bucks for the pita and a soda and headed back to work.  Opening the box I was surprised at what I saw.  A gigantic loaf of something sat there, smelling like heaven.  This thing was huge.  by huge I mean I could have boarded down a mountain on it.  Piping hot beef, cabbage and onions made up the filling.  The crust was made of Phyllo dough and was perfectly cooked.  This is comfort food at it's best.  The flavor was simple but delicious.  I was able to get two full meals outta this thing.  Two meals, six bucks...  For a rustic treat, give Panini Cafe and Bakery a try.  Note:  I'm not much for sweets, but the pastries here looked divine.

The Parlor takes me to a happy place, my own little slice of heaven where roasted olives flow freely and the beer is cold and delicious.  I first tried The Parlor last week for lunch.  The building is clean and has a very nice feel to it.  I sat at the bar, ordered a drink and perused the menu.  I was floored by how tasty everything sounded.  Really, I mean every last item on the menu is something I need to try.  Well done Parlor, well done.  I ordered up some roasted Queen Creek olives and a small Porchetta pizza.  Lets talk about olives for a moment.  I love olives of all shapes and sizes.  One of the great things about Phoenix is that the majority of restaurants I've tried have olives as an appetizer.  These roasted olives would make angels weep tears of joy.  Roasted lightly with garlic, spices and citrus peel the flavor is fantastic.  I had to fight the urge to order another round.  The Porchetta pizza was great too.  The pork was perfectly cooked, tender and chock full of piggy flavor.  All the toppings blended well.  This is what lunch should be.  So impressed was I that I decided to bring a friend to The Parlor the very next day.  As luck would have it they had a special three course menu for New Year's Eve.  I won't go into food porn details but suffice to say we were both very pleased.  Service was impeccable.  I'm already planning the third trip back this weekend since my parents are coming into town.  The duck club sandwich is next on my hit list of joy.  Three visits in just over a week?  This place deserves five stars and a big hug.

I've been to the Parlor every damn Saturday this year (well, except for when I'm not in town) and I have yet to be disappointed.  I'm slowly working my way through the entire menu.  Every week I try something different, although there are two constants; The roasted Queen Creek Olives appetizer and the Torta dessert.  Every week I leave pleased.  I've taken my parents/siblings/friends to The Parlor and they've all been blown away by the food and atmosphere.  So yeah,  I love The Parlor and I'll be happy once I've worked my way through the whole menu.

I've tried to pace myself when it comes to bragging up The Parlor, but there have been some tremendous standouts over the last few months that deserve some attention and praise.  Several weeks ago, on a date, I had one of the best seafood dishes I've ever eaten.  Wild caught Sturgeon on a bed of cippolini onions, purple fingerling potatoes, fava beans and a watercress puree with some greens on the top.  My date, who doesn't like fish, ended up eating half of the dish!  Truly great.  The other standout was the Spring Farro Risotto.  I never thought that risotto could come across as light, but this dish does.  Farro rice, preserved citrus, asparagus and spring peas all come together beautifully.  I had to force myself to stop eating in order to ensure I had leftovers for later.  It's pretty obvious that I'm a Parlor fanboy.  I don't feel bad about it though, they had to work pretty darn hard to make me this way.  Keep up the amazing work!

A short list of very real things that I've experienced dealing with cab companies:  -A creepy guy in a cowboy hat asking me if I was holding (I wasn't) -A creepy guy who felt that we bonded and should hang out -A creepy guy with a nervous tic, who kept twitching -A creepy guy who, in great detail, explained how giants once lived amongst us though their existence was covered up by government officials -A dispatch girl crying hysterically and hanging up on me  A short list of things I've experienced dealing with Clean Air Cab:  -Incredibly polite and intelligent dispatchers -Lower overall prices -Sane cabbies -Decent conversation -People willing to go above and beyond (A 3am run to the airport on a Tuesday) -Cabbies that take immense pride in their job and company.  In my mind there is no other cab company in Phoenix.  Clean Air Cab is the best.  Repeatedly rated the top cab company in Phoenix with a fleet numbering less than 50 out of several thousand cabs, Clean Air Cabs is doing something right, and I feel great in supporting them.  And really, thank god they never talk about giants.

After an insanely long weekend that involved work, diving and catering a baby shower (don't ask) I was in serious need of some downtime.  On a Sunday afternoon there just aren't many options, so I decided to finally try Hula's.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, which is exactly what I needed.  At 3pm the place was mostly empty, but it was obvious that the other patrons were having a great time.  I'm going to sum up my perfect, relaxing meal.  Blackened ahi with a wasabi cream sauce (damn good!), a bevy of island themed beverages and Dramarama playing in the background.  Could it get any better?  Now that I've sampled what Hula's has to offer I see the very real possibility of becoming a regular.  Bonus points for being within biking distance!  Thank you Hula's for giving me a mellow afternoon.  PS- Get the Blood Orange martini on the rocks.  You will swoon.

Because it's Friday and I'm in the mood to celebrate, it's time to review the ultimate Disneyland for drunks. Total Wine, you are the bees knees. The proper mindset for this review should not be "I'd like a beer with dinner." This is Friday-afternoon-lets-tie-one-off time.   Even the most moderate of imbibers will start to get an itch, a sort of hunger, when entering the hallowed halls of this market. Wide aisles stocked to the roof greet you.   I won't discuss the wine because, frankly, I'd sound like an idiot. Lets just assume it's great. I can't look at the beer and booze sections without hearing angels sing. This is a good thing since angels sing well.   I have yet to crave a brew that I haven't been able to find at Total Wine. If I'm feeling homesick for Tucson (which doesn't happen much) I can grab an ice cold sixer of Nimbus Old Monkeyshine. Delicious monkeys... Seriously though, think of a beer. Go to Total Wine and find it. It's like magic! 9%abv magic. Want great beer in a can? Grab yourself an Old Chubb, Ha, I just made myself giggle.   The booze selection is a beautiful testament to excess. The selection is varied, detailed and complete. To compare it to another adult beverage superstore the defining difference is the selection. Whereas the unnamed superstore would have two or three kinds of say, Limoncello, Total Wine has close to a dozen. You can't beat that.   The most amazing thing about Total Wine is the pricing. A six pack of Kiltlifer is nearly three bucks less than I can find it elsewhere. The aforementioned Limoncello is typically four to five dollars cheaper. I justify buying top shelf stuff by telling myself that it's a bargain. I lie to myself alot.   If you're looking to get your drank on, there is no better place to go than Total Wine.

Mexican style food in Phoenix is both varied and plentiful, so any restaurant that can lure me in to being a regular is doing something right.   La Condesa is a hip little taco shop on 16th street, close enough for me to walk to. The decor is a trendy/traditional mash up that works well. Honestly, the food is good enough that I'd probably buy it from a guy in an alley.   I've sampled several different varieties of meat based products as well as the beans. Everything has been well prepared and fresh. The Mayan Cochinita Pibil in particular is drool-worthy. It's mildly sweet and super tender. Adding a little of the chipotle salsa really sets it off.   Ah, the salsa. There are some truly interesting varieties, from tamarind to pecan. The pecan salsa was a great surprise, with a nice amount of heat. It really sits well with the carne asada.   My only negative comment involves the parking situation. The parking lot is situated in such a way that in order to leave you have to back out onto 16th street. If a big ass SUV with tinted windows happens to park next to you (which always seems to happen) then pulling out can be...invigorating.   La Condesa now has a well earned spot of honor in my restaurant rotation.

None of you will ever eat at the Concorde Cafe, and that's a shame.   Tucked into the bottom floor of the Concorde Commerce Center, the Concorde Cafe is one of the many cafes that exist solely to give office workers somewhere to eat. Most of these types of cafes are little more than cafeterias and they don't try to be any better. Heck, you have a captive audience, so why bother trying?   The menu isn't amazing. It's your basic breakfast and lunch menu with sandwiches, soups and salads. What Concorde has that so many other places like this lack is a love of food.   Deli products are all Boars' Head, the bread is fresh and local and so is the iced tea. Everything is made to order and it's made well. The turkey melt is exactly what you'd expect, perfectly executed. It's delicious and grilled to perfection.   There are multiple daily specials. One is usually a discount on a normal menu item, the other is something unique, like a vegetarian quesadilla. Once again, this is no-frills food perfectly executed.   I leave you with an example of the attitude of the staff. One morning, my employers sponsored a pancake breakfast. Having gotten my pancakes I wandered into Concorde to get a few sticks of bacon. As I was waiting for the bacon the cook came out to ask how the pancakes were. It turns out that had made the batter for them and was genuinely concerned that they were good. We talked about the batter for a good five minutes.   I'm glad that I have a simple, wonderful place like this within walking distance.

Like many other people my age, the movie Jaws completely traumatized me. I have a deep fear of the ocean and would never have considered diving...   ...until I was given the opportunity to go on a dream vacation sailing around the Caribbean. Damn you dream vacation, you're making me face my fears!   I had a whopping two weeks to get my open water certification or else I'd spend some quality time sitting alone on a boat. After some frustrating research I found the Scuba Shop.   The shop offers either a three week course or an accelerated four day program. Perfect!   The cost of the course is reasonable, although there are some kind of hidden costs. The quoted price gets you the class and pool time, it doesn't get you the four open water dives necessary to actually get certified. I didn't really care, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time.   The Instructor, Casey W, was amazing. He was able to clearly explain all the details we needed to not die, and he did it in a practical way. I can't say enough about how great a job he did.   Thanks to The Scuba Shop I was able to get certified in about a week, taking into account the open water dives. Not only am I certified, but I genuinely enjoy diving! Who would have thought?   I am now ready for an amazing trip, some great diving and not getting eaten by a vengeful Great White.

By now we're all perfectly aware that food trucks are a thing, and a wonderful thing at that.  I've sampled wares from every truck I see, and I can honestly say that Torched Goodness is a favorite of mine.  I'm no expert when it comes to sweets since I rarely have a sweet tooth.  And yet...  I simply can't say no to Torched Goodness!  The idea and execution are simple and it works very well.  My personal favorite is Chocolate with a hint of chili pepper.  It hits all the right notes.  If you see Torched Goodness around town, do yourself a favor and indulge.  You won't be disappointed.

If The Parlor wasn't closed on Sundays I might never have gone to Gasper's, which would have been tragic.   The decor conjures images of days past, days of sharkskin shoes and martini lunches. That is to say, it's pretty neat.   I've sampled the bruschetta, calamari, and a host of pizzas. Everything has been delicious, with bold flavors and good preparation. The service has always been spectacular, though to be honest I've always had the same guy.   I very much enjoy having the option of grabbing a tasty pie to bring home after a hard day of work. Gaspar's is that option.

I'm not typically a frequent eater of hot dogs. I usually get a craving once or twice a month tops. Thanks to the genius that is Short Leash my habit is becoming a weekly occurrence.   Like heroin or crack, a Short Leash dog will have you hooked after one hit. Sadly, this habit isn't as easy to break as the others.   The dogs themselves are of the highest quality, with excellent flavor and crunch. The beer hot is my preferred tube o' meat and it's wonderful, with just the right kick.   My first visit I decided to build my own dog; Beer hot, beans, cheddar, onion and spicy mustard. The list of toppings is impressive to say the least. The second time there I went with one of their pre-built concoctions. Each time I was amazed at how all the flavors blended and how delicious everything was.   Customer service is excellent as well, yet another reason to support the business.   Thanks to the spectacular overall experience Short Leash Dogs can expect a visit from me every Saturday.

Disclaimer:  I'm not a tea expert. I don't own a diffuser. I prefer my tea iced and plain because, frankly, I'm sweet enough.   In search of the ever elusive 'thoughtful' Christmas gift for my picky sister I stopped in at Fleur de Teas in the hopes of finding something special. I wasn't disappointed.   The shop, located next to the Phoenix City Grille, is small and cozy. Don't let the size fool you, this small spot is bursting at the seams with a huge variety of tea, tea accessories and beauty products.   The staff was friendly and very helpful, walking me through several different varieties of tea until I found exactly what I was looking for. Needless to say, the gift was a hit (and very reasonably priced).   I'm not a tea expert, but Fleur de Teas makes me want to be. I'll be back!

I'm not really a big breakfast kind of guy. I'm more the type that eats his lunch for breakfast, then another lunch for lunch.   A few times a year I get the desire, dare I say the NEED to eat a nice big breakfast. Sunday was just such a day. I chose Joe's.   Joe's opened the same week that I moved to Phoenix. I've driven by it almost every day since the opening, yet this was my first time dining there.   Parking was easy thanks to the big lot. My parents and I were promptly seated in a giant booth in the back. The atmosphere was super comfortable, with a very clean diner/car shop feel to it.   The menu is a throwback to the good ole' days of diner foods. The breakfast menu is every basic desire you could have. The lunch menu has some very tantalizing options too, but I was here for the breakfast.   #2 was ordered by all, with scrambled eggs. They should rename the #2 'perfection,' serving up sausage, bacon, eggs and pancakes. The folks got coffee, a blend from Tucson. I'm not typically a coffee drinker, but this coffee is the kind that I'd really enjoy black. Next time!   Thanks to our friendly and efficient server the food was promptly delivered to the table. The eggs were well cooked and the bacon was perfectly crisped. The sausage was delicious, though I prefer it cooked just a wee bit more. And then there were the pancakes.   Others here have nailed it in regards to the pancakes. They rock! These thin, crispy Frisbees of delight are packed with flavor. I loved nearly every bite. Sadly, the last bite defeated me.   Having a great place like this within minutes from my home is both a blessing and a curse. Needless to say, I'll be coming back frequently.   One last thing to note: If you've eaten at Joe's you've met Joe. He's constantly out busing tables and chatting up the customers. He takes great pride in what he's doing and really seems to care. In a brief conversation Joe summed up the three things he thought his restaurant needed improvement on, and what he was doing to resolve them. This place deserves to succeed. Be a sport and support Joe!

A hungry nun is a scary nun. Thanks to Rico's I was able to witness this firsthand.   On the lookout for a lunch on Sunday I chose Rico's. I had some family in town, including my aunt the nun. We were seated quickly in a nearly empty restaurant.   Menus were handed out promptly, after which our server disappeared. We all made up our minds and prepared to order. The restaurant had an almost desolate quality to it, due to the quiet emptiness surrounding us.   We waited...   Finally our server came out to take our orders. Meatloaf sandwiches and burgers were ordered by all.   We waited...   A half our later polite conversation was exhausted. I noticed a steely glint in the eye of the nun. Still no food.   We waited...   45 minutes later our food arrived. Keep in mind there were literally no other customers in the place. The meatloaf sandwich was decent, though it was a little dry. The sweet potato fries were a flaccid, tasteless afterthought. The burgers were well received and cooked to order. Finally the nun was at peace with the world, though she was also disappointed in the meatloaf.   It's possible that our timing was bad. Maybe we came in at the tail end of a massive brunch crowd or something. I'm willing to give Rico's another chance.   Still, I don't I'll be going back to Rico's if there's a nun in my party.

The second location for Los Taquitos opened on October 8th, 2010, and WOW!  It's delightful.  I've been searching for fast, delicious takeout in the 16th street/Glendale area for a few weeks now.  Up until last Saturday I was tortured by a sign:    'Coming Soon'  Finally the wait is over and I can now enjoy delicious tacos for lunch.  The menu is varied, with anything from breakfast burritos to tortas, but I can't seem to make it past the tacos.  Anyone familiar with the original location will understand the simple joy of the street tacos.  Small tortillas (double wrapped), well prepared meat, onions and cilantro.  You can't mess with that perfection.  The Tortillas are light and delicious, and hold up to the meat well.  And the meat, ah the meat.  The choices are chicken, carne asada, carnitas and al pastor.  Shrimp is also available.  I've tried each of the meat selections.  The carne asada is very tender.  The chicken is cooked to perfection as well.  Really though, it's the pig parts that really stand out.  The al pastor is wonderfully flavored, with just a hint of crispness.  The carnitas are divine.  I don't know how they pack that much flavor into such a small taco, but it's far and away my favorite.  Another big plus (for me) is the size of the tacos.  They're small, maybe two or three bites apiece.  Ordered individually it's a great way to sample a variety of tacos.  For me, I allow myself only two after hitting the gym.  I reward myself with tacos, and I challenge you to find a better system.  Since it's a new location there are a few minor issues, mostly dealing with the register system and some slowness with expediting food.  I have no doubt that this will work itself out in no time.  To conclude, I now have my go to lunch spot during the work week.  I'm also willing to bet I'll be stopping by on the weekends too.  Hell, I'll probably work out more thanks to my Taco Reward Plan.

Los Taquitos gets an extra star for their habanero salsa.  It made me sweat, it made me cry and I'm in love.  I drank the leftover salsa like a shot, it was that good.  All the little things (slowish service and register issues) have already ironed themselves out.  Expect a delicious, fast meal.

What a delightful little shop.   Having driven by The Bee's Knees several times I thought I'd pop in and see what the store had to offer.   The front of the store contained original artwork from several local artisans, as well as some really cool collectibles. The atmosphere was pleasant, and coffee and cupcakes were offered by the proprietor. Nice!   At it's heart The Bee's Knees is 1/3 art shop, 1/3 thrift store and 1/3 gallery. The thrift store portion is mostly for the ladies, as the men's portion is one small rack. Still, the stuff is all pretty cool and reasonably priced.   If you have an hour to kill and a few bucks to drop you should check out The Bee's Knees, you may find something fun.

My return trip to SaBai was excellent.  I stopped in due to an irresistable craving for something with shrimp.  I was in a take out sort of mood, so as I sat at the bar the friendly owner gave me a glass of water with a cucumber slice in it.  I was pretty floored at how refreshing something so simple could be!  I quickly got my order of Garlic Shrimp (extra spicy) and headed home.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked.  So perfect that I can't think of any other shrimp to compare it to.  I was happy to see a decent crowd in the restaurant.  I know I'll be coming back again.

When an individual adds the word 'Master' to their title, I envision someone who has trained in an isolated mountain compound for decades, mastering techniques long lost to the masses.   The Art of Shaving is no exception.   I was wandering through the hell that is Scottsdale Fashion during the holiday season when I saw a new shop, The Art of Shaving. In need of a haircut I walked in.   The front of the house is a retail shop with a vast selection of razors and shaving accessories. Be warned, nothing in this shop would be considered a bargain.   After a short conversation I found that the Master Barber was free for a walk in client. I was led to the back of the shop and...   ...Was promptly transported into old-timey barber heaven. Imagine your ideal barber shop from a bygone era and that's what you get.   The Master Barber was friendly and skilled. He took his time to shave my head and I will freely admit he did a better job than anyone ever has. Next, the straight razor shave.   What an experience. The hot towel, the pre-shave oil face rub, all of it. I challenge anyone to find a more relaxing situation involving a razor at your neck. The barber had a deft hand and worked with skill born of years of practice.   The whole affair took over an hour and I walked out feeling like a new man. Never again, I thought, would I be able to go to the corner shop for a haircut. Then I got the bill. Ah, I thought, the corner barbershop is for me.   The shop is amazing, the Master Barbers are truly skilled and the experience is great. The price, however, makes this a special occasion type thing rather than a weekly occurrence.   If you want to treat yourself to the manly version of a day at the spa go to the Art of Shaving. If you want a haircut go elsewhere and save a big chunk o' cash.
