My family and i went in for lunch during a week day and it was not busy at all, only one other customer there. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. first off it took an excessive amount of time to make 2 buffalo chicken sandwiches and one lunch special (6 Wings & fries). Finally my sandwich came out not being what i expected at all. it was supposed to be a chicken breast (grilled I assume) and what i received was 3 small pieces of dried out chicken on 2 pieces of sliced bread (not even a bun). It could not be eaten as a sandwich because the bread was soaked in excessive amounts of wing sauce. if i wanted a chicken sandwich with wing sauce thrown everywhere i would have made a much better one at home. No refills were offered on the drinks, we didn't even receive the bill, I had to go to the counter and pay my bill without receiving one at the table. I requested ranch for my sandwich and was not informed i would be paying $1.50 for 1 ounce of ranch. Needless to say we will not be returning to this establishment and highly recommend not wasting your time dinning here.

Decided to chance it this morning by being one of the first people to the car wash. The attendant talked me into the highest level Ultra Star wash because it was $5 off it was only $27.95. Not the type of clean I would expect from a $32.95 car wash. The car still had bugs stuck to the front and side view mirrors... That I cleaned when I got home. Only the drivers door-jam was wiped down, the other 3 and the rear were not at all. The driver side rubber floor mat was removed and vacuumed under it but the others had not or even vacuumed around for that matter. The rear of the SUV appeared to not have been either because there was no marks in the carpet from the vacuum nozzle and I even opened it up for them.... I highly recommend taking your vehicle elsewhere unless you just don't care how your vehicle looks and like to waste your time and money.

Here for lunch and ordered the Broasted Chicken dark meat combo. Disappointing to say the least, the meat was cooked fine but the size of the thigh was extremely small to the point the leg actually had more meat than the thigh. The fries here used to be AMAZING..... Not so much anymore they are typical small greasy fries without the crispness they once had.

Ordered take out Pizza and Wings this evening. Order came quicker than was stated in the confirmation email. The pepperoni pizza (hand tossed crust) was like I ordered it from back home, light with a slight crisp to the crust. Wings were cooked perfectly and meaty. The Gold Spicy sauce was wicked good too.

Decided to try this place last night for the first time. My wife got the noodles with orange chicken and spring rolls, I got the fried rice and double coconut shrimp. First thing I notice is the serving area is clean, the steam from the warmer, and the portions are huge! I went out on  a limb and ordered double coconut shrimp and fried rice without sampling and headed home with my to go order. My choice was definitely the right one, the shrimp was cooked to perfection! Most places the shrimp is always over cooked and has a rubbery consistency, but this was tender. The coating still had a crisp to it with the creamy sauce on it. I personally highly recommend Red Wok over the "other place" across the road.

I actually came across this this place jut searching on Yelp. I am always looking for places that are out of the norm of restaurants. I had the a regular hot dog and six wings for my lunch and it was amazing! Nice char on the hot dog with great flavor with the toppings not overpowering the meat. Wings were cooked properly with a nice crisp to the skin and medium sauce was just the perfect amount of heat and flavor.
