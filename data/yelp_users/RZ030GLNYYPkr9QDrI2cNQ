Man, I love this place.   I usually end up with #23, I don't know how to say it in Vietnamese, but it's damn good. My wife usually gets a #22, which is apparently a very, very, authentic dish. I am told you can only get it in certain areas of Vietnam, it is also delicious.   Spring rolls, best anywhere, I have yet to find a better spring roll from the 20-or-so other Pho places I've been to.  #47 for those of you who like Steak and rice dishes.

Yen is the go-to place for Sushi in Arizona. Having been to quite a few places and also living on the coast, I can say their fish is quality. The wait staff can vary, sometimes it's excellent, other times it's not. I enjoy their Albacore and Red Snapper sashimi and their off-the-menu King Crab hand roll (real crab, woot!). If you enjoy quality sashimi, this is an excellent place. If you're into all the fancy mayonnaise-based sushi rolls, you probably won't notice a difference.

Had egg noodle with pork and wonton (#42), chicken broth was delicious, better than da vangs. However, my friend had the pho tai and I wasn't a fan of the beef broth, it wasn't bad or flavorless, just not my style. Egg noodles were a bit underdone meaning the broth should have been slightly hotter, I let them soak for a good 3-4 minutes after I initially tasted them. We also had boba, it was chunky (like ice bits), flavor was fine though. I had the coconut and my friend had the Taro. They also don't use the sealed top boba cups which I prefer as I like to shake the drink to mix all the boba (otherwise you get the warm filled bottom of the drink where the boba sits). Giving it 4 stars, I would have no problem going back.

Staff forgot to sub steam rice for brown rice and 'thai' hot is not actually 'thai' hot, it was fairly weak. Other than the small mistakes, the food is good, though I wish it had more kick.

I'm a bit fond of LGO, but the Gluten-Free crust here is worlds ahead of LGO. With that in mind, I am not a huge fan of their pizza sauce, but that's just personal preference. They have two very satisfying organic iced tea's. I also really like their Greek Salad.

I've never been to any part of Mexico worth mentioning, but if I do I would hope the food is this good.

Burgers were pretty good, surely a large meal. All the food is al a carte, so you do not get your burger with fry's, they are extra. I paid roughly $11 for a cheeseburger, fries, and drink. My friend paid roughly $8 for his cheeseburger and drink. The fries can easily be shared between two people as it was way more than I could eat, in fact two of us actually ended up throwing away half the fries, there were so many. They have a fairly decent choice of toppings, the typical lettuce, onion, tomato, and options for grilled onions, jalapenos, and a couple others at no extra charge. The price may be a bit high for a fast-food joint, but rest assured you'll be getting your fill.

Dan is the man!  Looking for a great street-style taco, this is the place to go. Their Fish Taco's are to die for!  Also, you want Fresh Homemade Horchata? This is the place to be! I thought I enjoyed the fake, fountain bought Horchata, well that was the way of the past! Ever since I had the Horchata at Tacos Atoyac, I haven't gone back to the other stuff.   All their food is great, rolled tacos, burros, fish, pork, etc, it's all great.   Everything is Al La Carte, so expect to order a few tacos if you want a meal.

Perhaps something has drastically changed in the last month, but anyone who rated this place 5 stars was either paid a very large sum of money or lacks serious taste - likely a combination of both.  In the words of the late, great, Rick James, "I wish I had two more hands so I could give this restaurant four thumbs down!"  It all began with a trip to the neighboring Vietnamese restaurant which a friend noted had decent food. Of course, this place was randomly closed on a Wednesday in the summer. I am not in tune with Vietnamese culture, but I can only imagine that something more important than running your business is happening on a Wednesday, in the summer, in order to be closed. We decide to wander over to Gus's Pizza, complete with the unnecessary "s". We take our seats right around noon. About five minutes later we are asked if we want a soda, no option for Iced Tea or water at the time, just simply, soda. Two Iced Tea's, a Coke, and a "Cherry" Coke later, we decide to order appetizers. It's roughly 12:19pm when we place our order as follows:  -One 10 piece order of 'hot' wings -One Special (all you can eat pizza, single topping slices, $4.95) -One Fire Burger, Medium, with Fries. -One Fire Burger, Medium, with Onion Rings. -One Chicken Gyro, with Fries.  Ten minutes pass before the waitress informs us that they only have one patty and two burger orders. I forfeit my burger and choose the Beef Gyro. Five minutes later, I hear an "Oh shit" in the background. The waitress returns informing me there is not any beef for the beef gyro and suggests a chicken gyro, I pass.   12:40pm   -First drink refill received  12:49pm  -Hot wings order received  12:54pm  -One Fire Burger Received  12:58pm  -Chicken Gyro Received -Side of Onion Rings Received  1:03pm  -Magically, some beef gyro meat was found. My gyro was delivered and I was informed that I would not be charged for the gyro or onion rings.  1:07pm  -Two slices, one pepperoni, one sausage, received.  I'll point out a couple of things if they weren't already obvious.  A pizza joint, which has pizza in the title of the business, should probably have pizza ready during lunch hour, especially when offering an "all-you-can-eat" special. I found it strange that the pizza was delivered last.  As far as the missing beef, it brings me back to the Burger King commercials from the 1980's, "Where's the beef??" - well, had I known it would taste as it did, I'd be asking, "Where's the door?" To their defense, the place was not known as Gus's Pizza, Burgers, and Gyros.   With the exception of the wings, which were fairly decent, the gyro meat looked and tasted microwaved. The burger, which I tried a small sample of, reminded me of reheated cafeteria food - the kind you would get from public grade schools.   The onion rings were over fried and the fries were showered in salt (not the quick shower, better related to the long showers where your mom questions why the water bill was so high last month.)  Our bill, less the comped gyro and onion rings was just shy of $39. We split it four ways. I tipped a hair over 20%, mainly because the waitress was polite, despite the quality of the food or slow service. Also because it is the first and last bit of money they will ever receive from me.   Thanks for the experience.

Ordered the Red Curry lunch special, 'Thai' hot. It had a nice spice to it, not overpowering the flavor. I plan to try the Double Thai Hot next time I am in.   Service was great, I drink Iced Tea pretty damn fast, I never had to wait long for a refill.   The curry wasn't runny, like many other Thai restaurants. It has a nice consistency. The fried spring rolls were tasty.  We also tried the home made ice cream with fried banana. It was a coconut ice cream and it was excellent.   I'll be sure to come back, this is my new favorite Thai place in the west valley!

Cheap prices, decent food, friendly staff. I had the General Tsao's, added a side of veggies and an iced tea - came out to $8.30. My friend had the Kung Poa Chicken with water and he was out the door for $5.40 (less tip).   I gave this place 5 stars for the friendly staff, great price, and decent food.

Come here quite often for lunch, must have been a bad day.  I was here on Friday the 23rd with a group of colleagues. As usual, we ordered a couple plates of hummus - green. As I'm scooping some of it up on my fork, I notice a round green object hiding in my scoop. I assumed it as a jalapeño since the hummus is jalapeño/cilantro.... NOPE. As I inserted that delicious bite of hummus into my mouth, I found that the little green object was a ruse; a rubber band in disguise.  I informed our waiter, who was pretty slow on the refills and wasn't quite aware of how to place drinks on the table without excess body contact or reach. He replaced the hummus, not providing any apology. The replacement wasn't even comped.   On a positive note the hummus today was much better than last time - rubber band free. As was the service.
