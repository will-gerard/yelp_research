Worst apartment complex i have ever lived in. First off i paid my rent, a day late. And they charged me 400$ in late fees and didn't tell me. Then they evicted me and my spouse. Then someone broke in and stole my stuff. Fuck this place and their shitty management. I wouldn't recommend this complex to anyone!!!

I usually come here a couple of times a month and I absolutely adore this place. But today was a different story. Their Yelp indicates they are open until 3 pm. My boyfriend and I walked in the door at 1:27 and got taken to a table. We were already feeling rushed at this point. Then our food came out.... Quite fast may I add. My pancakes were outstanding, on the other hand my boyfriend's 49er flapjacks were soggy and not crispy how they should be. Again... Obviously rushed. Before we were done eating at 1:50 our rude server brought us the bill and said we needed to pay then because they were trying to finish up paperwork. Then proceeded to reach over us to clear an insignificant plate. I then attempted to inform her of the hour of operation displayed on their yelp said 3 pm and they might want to change it because we were misled and then felt rushed. She walked away from us as we tried to tell her this... Disrespect like this shouldn't have even gotten you a tip you rotten server. Great job guys  you lost loyal customers!

Last time I reviewed on this business I was a very unsatisfied customer.... Yet I don't want anyone to not try this wonderful pancake house. From the 49ers to the monkey bread to just some buttermilk pancakes... This place is the BEST. I've been coming here for years & it's definitely a gem.

SUCKS WORST SERVICE IN TOWN!! Don't come here. They are terrible servers and bartenders. Your JOB is to serve people NOT to gaggle.
