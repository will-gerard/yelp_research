I'd give this a zero if I could. What is supposed an exciting and fun time has become an utter nightmare. I've been here three times within the past week and each time I'm told something different. If you ask questions, be sure to record their responses. Very frustrating and Dorene does not have ANY customer service skills and fights everything you say making you feel insignificant and unwelcome. They talk about you as if they think you are not present/within hearing distance. What happened to the customer is right? The only reason I've come back is because it is required by my employer. Lizete is a breath of fresh air because she is as sweet and helpful as possible!

This place is awful! I had called my order in, which took over 10 minutes because the person had no idea where the crepes were and then did NOT ask me about my side options. I pick up the item and all the staff was rude. They even forgot hash browns. The patrons here let their kids run all around and even hit strangers in the legs. DO NOT GO HERE!

Great service! Never a long wait for spa pedicure. HUGE selection of gel polish colors! I've been to this salon 4 times now and it's still great every time.

This place was amazing! Everyone was so nice and accommodating! They were VERY clean and Tiffany did an awesome job on my nail design.
