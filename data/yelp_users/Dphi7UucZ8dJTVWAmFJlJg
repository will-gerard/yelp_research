What? Only one review for Blue Fin on Yelp (as of October 2007)? That's crazy! This place is a true gem. Oh wait, maybe that's why there's only one review...  Well, not to overcrowd this little spot which is usually busy enough, but I have to sing their praises a little bit. Blue Fin serves very good, healthful Japanese food and is run by some of the sweetest people you'll ever meet (thanks Howard and Betsy!)  I've tried many things on the menu and it's all very tasty. However there's one dish that I always go back for and find myself craving - the white meat teriyaki chicken. Yes, I know, teriyaki is the most common Japanese dish in America, but Blue Fin's is simply awesome.   Most restaurants serve teriyaki as chicken with commercially-made sauce squeezed on top. But Blue Fin marinates their chicken in a homemade teriyaki that's just incredible. It's a big serving and I rarely leave any on the plate. Order it with the salad and it's even better - the best asian salad dressing beside's flo's asian kitchen. And sprinkle on some of the spicy seasoning that's on the table, too. hard to beat it.  Only drawback lately is all the construction around the area, but hey that's downtown these days. And we're lucky Blue Fin is still there - the city had planned to buy and demolish the building, but customers put up such a fuss they decided to let them stay. Hurray for democracy! And hurray for Blue Fin!

Years ago, I remember hearing Chris Bianco say he was searching around for a kitchen in town where he could bake bread and do some occasional cooking. How lucky for us Valley folk that he took that idea a couple steps further and opened a lunch spot.  And, boy, does he bake bread here - that's what makes the sandwiches at Pane Bianco unforgettable. It's like ciabatta meets pita bread in a wood-fired oven - and every bit as good as his pizza dough. Add to that some of the best meats, cheeses and other deliciousness available and you've got one heck of a great sandwich.   I'm usually partial to whatever the market sandwich happens to be - especially the prosciutto, sausage or braseola - though the always-on-the-menu sopressata can be every bit as tasty (note: sometimes the salami is sliced really thick and I prefer thinner slices; also the red peppers are great, but I kind of miss the olive tapenade they use to use.)  Focaccia here is also a don't miss and flavors change daily. I think it's best when there's tomato, caramelized onions and a hard cheese; definitely asked for it warmed up. Not a big fan of the lemon rosemary, but I'm sure that appeals to some palates.   I've only had a salad once, never the tuna, so I can't really say much about those, except that I'm sure the ingredients and flavor combinations are top-notch - wouldn't be in a Bianco restaurant otherwise. That's why I always come back for more...

This happens occasionally, too. Heidi E. and I are friends, but sometimes friends don't agree. Maybe it's a matter of different tastes, or even different experiences, who knows, but I have a very different take on Med House.  I've been eating at Mediterranean House regularly for the last 6 or 7 years. Started with a group of business friends for occasional lunches, then for dinners with my partner, and now it's a couple times a month for take out. (Have to say I prefer take-out for a few reasons: convenient, neighborhood spot; food travels well; only beer + wine when dining in.)  I find the food here to generally be great - though not always consistent, have had one or two just so-so dinners. That said, when the kitchen is on, the food can be spectacular. We usually order the same few dishes - one of the chicken plates and the gyros platter.   My favorite chicken plate is the Olympic Chicken, which is grilled chicken breast with a really delicious black olive sauce. The Moroccan Chicken is also really good, and maybe a little healthier with it's herbed breasts, honey-yogurt sauce and side of carrots, apple and spinach (which is not cooked, just shredded, but surprisingly good.) If you want rich flavor, go for the Egyptian Chicken, which is pan-fried in parmesan cheese and herbs. If you want spicy, go for the Chicken Shushka, which is more stew-like, flavored with lots of paprika.   The Gyros platter is a standard favorite, though Med House does it a little different. No shredded lamb here - instead, you get 4 long pieces of juicy, tender meat. I think the quality is better this way, and it makes for a nice dinner presentation. Pita and house-made yogurt-cucumber sauce are still the perfect accompaniments, and If you like spicy, ask for the spicy green sauce - some kind of minced hot green peppers - the flavors match the gyros meat perfectly.  Hummus and Baba Ganouj appetizers are just OK, I suggest the Lentil soup instead - vegetarian, made from scratch, delicious and hearty. Salad is OK as well - dressing can be a little too citrus-y or vinegar-y for my taste, but always fresh feta and crisp veggies. Love the rice pilaf, with almonds and apricots, and the 2 pasta sides - fettucine with creamed spinach or angel hair pasta with sundried tomato and feta - both are rich with flavor.  If you're interested in trying Mediterranean House, I suggest sooner rather than later, as the strip mall where they're located may be seeing some major changes. The building owner has told tenants he'll not be guaranteeing any leases, and most tenants are already gone. Unfortunately, if Med House loses their lease, they may not reopen at all. I'm pretty sad about that, and a couple nights a month I'm sure my stomach and taste buds will be, too.

THE RULES:  1. To buy or be helped with anything, you must check in with an "orange shirt" - this person has the clipboard and will write your name down with the reason for your visit.   2a. If you have questions or want to buy something, you must then wait for a "blue shirt" to come help you - expect at least a 5 minute wait  2b. If you've made an appointment for the "genius" bar, you must wait in back for your name to be YELLED out by a "genius" in a black shirt - expect at least a 15 minute wait (If you haven't made an appointment for the "genius" bar, you'll probably just get laughed at)  3. If you want to purchase an item, a "blue shirt" will check you out with their hand-held device, when available. (There is only one "register," a computer pos system located at the "genius" bar, but it's use is "not encouraged.") If you bring cash or want a bag, expect a longer check out because those are kept somewhere else, of course. Receipts can be emailed to you, printed out, or both.   I wish I would've known these things before my last visit - I would've gone elsewhere or just gone online. Can't tell you how much I hated the experience. I guess the setup is good if you're someone who needs a lot of assistance, but for someone with a simple purchase or quick question, the hassles and hoops of this store isn't worth the inconvenience.

always a decent selection of men's shoes at the scottsdale promenade location - diesel, tsubo, nike and a bunch of high-end brands; even scored a hot pair of prada there once. and usually some decent men's clothing, but you'll have to hunt harder  in the apparel section - which is part of the fun, at least for me.  and NO, nordstrom rack is not the same as last chance. not even close. the rack is much more civilized and only a few pair of the shoes have been worn before (and if they have, they've been decently refinished)

Sushi Q was suggested to me by a regular customer. She and I share similar tastes in food and would often see each other at our neighborhood sushi favorite, Hana. Always up for a new food experience, I went to Sushi Q with my partner tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  It's one of those unassuming, stuck-in-a-strip-mall-in-an-odd-part-of-town places -- tucked away between a liquor store and baskin-robbins on 19th avenue, just south of dunlap. Inside is a somewhat typical looking sushi place, a little dated but with a nice enough wooden sushi bar and some cute japanese accents (geisha prints, sake bottles, row of cute fortune cat figures.)  My partner had already arrived and was enjoying a couple items off the all-you-can-eat menu, so I decided to join him. I'm not much of an all-you-can eat person, but somehow it seems OK here - and a decent bargain at $25 per person. I'm happy to say that it was a smart decision as everything we had was really good to delicious. Not to mention a great way to sample items on the sushi menu. (AYCE menu is a bit more limited than regular sushi menu, but still offers a good variety of items)  You'll find most of the usual suspects on the AYCE sushi menu, plus a variety of specialty rolls. Salmon and albacore nigiri, spicy tuna handroll and agadashi tofu were all very good (though agadashi was really just tempura tofu with dipping sauce). Red Snapper nigiri was outstanding -  fresh light fish with a citrus ponzu, green onion and bit of sriracha for just the right kick. Also really enjoyed the Hot Night roll - spicy tuna, crab and avocado deep fried and topped with spicy mayo, sriracha and sesame seeds - yum! what's not to like about that?  There's also a small but decent selection of sake and beer here, and prices are very reasonable compared to other sushi spots in town. Our server and sushi chef were very nice and helpful, and I have a feeling that the more we come back, the more we'll feel like family. And I can tell you now, we'll be back many times...

Years ago (mid-90's) when I worked on Mill Ave., I used to eat here weekly. Now I live and work in Central Phoenix, but still try to grab lunch here every month or so. The food is just as good now as it was back in the day - and I don't think the menu has changed much either, and it hasn't needed to.  You really can't go wrong with any of the salads offered on any given day - they're always freshly made and tasty. Choose what looks and sounds best to you, there's always a nice variety. But if you're a fan of chicken salad, I challenge you to find one better - perfectly creamy with nice pieces of shredded white-meat chicken and fresh, juicy grapes. Tamales and soups are pretty good, too, though not usually my thing here.  I also highly recommend the homemade honey lemonade - it's completely addictive. Just the right mix of honey sweetness and sour lemon. Get a big one and take it to go, you'll thank me I promise ;-}

consistently great food and the best drinks in town since, well, 1988. awesome space, open late, diverse crowd, educated djs and ever changing art installations.   can't wait to see what the christmas tree is this year, a true holiday tradition. past favorites include the tree made of coal that glowed red inside, the one made entirely out of high heels and the one that was hung upside down and spun around.

If I had a basement, I'd want it to look EXACTLY like Shady's - from the black vinyl booths and wrap-around bar to the pool table and oh-so-nice Tim Biskup painting. One of the coolest bars in town. And usually a pretty diverse crowd, which can be somewhat of a rarity in this town unfortunately. The jukebox rocks, the bartenders are friendly and the drinks are decent enough, though I'm not a big fan of mixed drinks in pint glasses...

Why there isn't a line out the door for the carnitas here I don't know. Maybe those in the know are just keeping it their little secret.   Well, I'm glad I figured it out because it's the most delicious carnitas I've ever had. It's almost a succulent pork stew, really - lots of shredded pork in a rich, flavorful gravy. I had it first on a taco, but now I get it as a "meat only" burrito with just onion, cilantro and red salsa. Pretty much pure burrito nirvana, cannot recommend it enough.  Other things I've had here are very good also, but it's the carnitas that will keep me coming back week after week.   And to top everything off, all the guys who work here are sincerely nice, friendly and always in a good mood. Which makes it all the more enjoyable.   Thank you Taqueria Mi Casita!

"HOLY MOTHER OF GOD! That's the BEST cookie I've ever had in my entire life..."  I'll bet they're used to hearing things like that at Essence, the macaroons are that good. Sinfully perfect really. A sugary crispness followed by delicious chewiness and the most amazingly light flavored cream fillings. Hands down one of the best bakery items I've had in The Valley. (Kudos to Phoenix Magazine for putting them on their September cover.)  Their Croque Monsieur gets my vote as one of the best sandwiches in town, too. Exactly the way it should be done - light egg wash on top-side of the bread, just the right amount of thinly sliced ham, and ooey-gooey gruyere holding it all together. And then Essence "kicks it up a notch" by adding fresh slices of jalapeno - genius.  Part of me wishes Essence was located in Central Phoenix, but my conscience knows better. The daring draw of those macaroons would turn me into Augustus Glump in no time. Sometimes a little distance is a good thing...

Wow, what can I say? Our first visit last night and we're already planning the next of what will surely be many more visits. Yasu has taken sushi and Japanese dining in Phoenix to a whole different level.  I think this is what places like Ippei and Taneko in Scottsdale have been trying to do, but just can't seem to get right. A modern Japanese restaurant that offers select sushi and a variety of sharable plates in a cool, comfortable atmosphere. Where the other restaurants fail, Yasu nails it.  Everything at Yasu was executed almost to perfection - food, service, decor, ambiance. Fantastic menu and even better list of specials, which had just as many items! Definitely try the tsukune, a skewered chicken "meatball" cooked over charcoal - just fantastic. And the sushi was uber fresh and delicious. They'll even customize to your taste if you ask. There's also a full bar and a very nice selection of wine and sake, of which the staff is very knowledgable.   Only a couple negatives to mention. The sushi bar is small, 4 people max, and you can't see the fish or chef's working their magic. Also, the seats at the sushi bar are 2 curved wooden benches - a bit hard and uncomfortable.  Other than that, I just wish we'd tried Yasu sooner, can't wait to go back for more...

My partner brought me here for what we thought would be a nice, romantic birthday dinner at a cozy neighborhood spot. We hadn't been in a year or so, and were both disappointed - here's the good + bad:  The good: 1. Shared plate #1 - slow-roasted pork, green chile cornbread casserole and maple-glazed carrots were all excellent, especially the pork which was so flavorful. Would have this again in an instant. 2. Classic lime mojito - very good if not just a bit sweet (but see point about drinks below) 3. The happy hour menu - 1/3 of the dinner page - looked great. 3-6pm, may have to give that a try instead of dinner  The bad: 1. Place was empty at 8pm - just one other table inside besides us (plus one guy at bar, one table on patio) 2. No music until halfway through dinner - then The Cure, Violent Femmes and other 80s alternative - which I like, but not in a sit-down restaurant for dinner. And the bartender sang along occasionally - ugh. 3. Mixed drinks in a pint glass - never a fan unless at a dive bar. 4. Out appetizer never came - waiter said he didn't remember us ordering even though he commented that the dish was good when we ordered. With just one other table, a big disappointment. (to his partial credit, he did bring us A SMALL PORTION of the appetizer with our entrees for free) 5. Shared plate #2 - new york strip, cheddar mashed potatoes and organic green beans were all just OK. Not a fan of the sauce the steak was in, and topping of mushrooms, onions and peppers too heavy. Way too much mashed potatoes and green beans, which were both pretty bland. 6. Toward the end of our meal, a young boy came into the restaurant and started playing with a ball right next to our table. I am not joking. wtf?  Overall, I'd like to think we just experienced an off-night here. But, attention to details like mood and music  (plus getting everything you ordered) are also important. Some of the food was very good, so we may give it another try sometime - but, truthfully, I think there are a number of better restaurants in the area.

Have been wishing for a sushi bar in our neighborhood for a long, long time (especially since Ayako/Akita-ya at The Biltmore closed) - never could have imagined one would open so close to our house and be this great. The sushi gods have blessed us!  We've eaten here regularly since they opened and have never had a bad meal. In fact, we've come to regard sushi chef Koji as a culinary genius (and would back him on Iron Chef any time!) Clever creations like Poki Chips and Tempura Mint Leaf are downright delicious, and he makes the best sashimi and hand rolls we've ever had.  What's best about Hana for us is that this is a neighborhood sushi bar - not a trendy hot spot . Focus here is on the food - and in just the right way. Not overdone like so many sushi spots with countless fancy rolls on the menu - and yet also not overly traditional like so many old-school sushi spots where they only offer standard nigiri and such (which can be quite good, don't get me wrong, but isn't it nice to add a little flavor and creativity, too?)   Being a neighborhood spot, Hana is quite small and can get crowded during peak hours. There's a small dedicated staff here and when crowded, service and food prep can be slow, it's only expected. We like to go later and sit at the sushi bar - to us that's always the best way to eat sushi anyway.

I asked a friend at The Arizona Republic if I could write a review on the best falafel in town. He didn't really seem to like the idea and never got back to me. Too bad, because I was looking forward to going to all the other Middle Eastern restaurants in town and comparing their falafel to MEBAD's, which is the best I've had in town so far.  The falafel at MEBAD is usually fantastic. Crispy on the outside, moist and tasty on the inside.  It's not overly oily and I've never had a dry falafel ball. And they're just the right size, about the size of a pinball. Occasionally I'll get a batch that is only slightly warmed up instead of freshly cooked, but they're still quite good.  The falafel sandwich is fine -- there are four or five balls in a pita with fresh lettuce, tomato and tahini for under $5 (I think) -- but I prefer the a la carte order, 5 piece falafel with a side of tahini and fresh pita for a couple bucks. I usually order that as an appetizer,  to share with others or eat myself in addition to a sandwich when I'm extra hungry.  Other than the falafel, I'm partial to the chicken gyros sandwich or plate. It's pieces of grilled chicken breast with lots of yummy middle eastern spices (which I think are still made and sold on premises) and caramelized onions. Couple that with tsatziki sauce + fresh pita and you've got one heck of a meal.  If you've got a sweet tooth, try the rice pudding, it's excellent. The baklava and halvah are great, too, but the pudding is the real winner. Made fresh daily and usually sells out. Now, if they could only make a dessert out of falafel....

Radio Milano has become one of our favorite restaurants since opening this summer. Why? Here are a few reasons:  1. The Food - antipasto and focaccia on par with Pizzeria Bianco, excellent seafood/crudo and some of the best meatballs and meatloaf in town - all in manageable portions  2. The Cocktails - try the ginger press, manhattan or milano, their signature version of a negroni, but made with vodka (no longer listed on menu however). Great bartenders, too.  3. The Atmosphere - from the open-air kitchen w/ wood burning grill to barrel-vaulted ceilings and walls of sliding glass, an inviting urban space. And while possibly trendy, not at all stuffy or inaccessable - always felt down to earth and comfortable to me.  4. Open Late - food served until 11pm every night. We love coming in for a late dinner and eating at the bar. Best seats in the house if you ask me.
