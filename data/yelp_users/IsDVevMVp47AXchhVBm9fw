The staff is so friendly!! I really can't stress this enough. They make you feel at home which seems weird for a moving supply company. I had a hitch put on by the nice people here and they gave me a time frame and had it done then. They are very affordable! I would recommend over and over!

Can we get a 6th star over here?! I have never been to a location that didn't have a line at noon... Well except here!   The parking lot is being redone.. People are running late and driving like ass holes.. To get in and no line was amazing to say the very least! And it was not luck! There were close to high 30's of people already eating! The staff is sooooo efficient! They still have a bit of small talk but not much. They move at lightning speeds to get you your lunch and back to work! I am so glad this place is right down the street from work! To put it in perspective of how quickly they got me in and out.. It took me longer to park than to order and pay for my lunch! These employees had all the bins fully stocked before lunch rush and kept things moving!   Now if one of those efficient people could direct traffic out front that would be great!

So when someone says I want Lo mein vegetarian for my life long veggie kid, and I come back up and say this tastes like fish.. And they reply with "oh next time order it with out oyster sauce that we add in." It's like I said I wanted Lo Mien made fucking vegetarian!  I'm sorry I did not walk back to your kitchen and test every bottle of sauce at a lab to see its ingredients, and tell you what to leave out! If I order 3 vegetarian meals for my family on a lunch break it may be I don't want dead shit in our food.  I took the untouched plate up and put it on the counter.  They came back and offered to remake it. Sorry I have to get back to work... I don't have time to wait. Oh ok well next time order it with out the sauce we add in"  Next time what a fucking joke. Where's my refund for you getting my order wrong? Next time.. That's priceless. I have been here once before and I promise you I won't be back.  Condescending arrogant staff, know your job. Or give me your pay check and I'll do it for you!  Don't waste your time or money at this place. I'm sure their are a billion other places who will

The coffee is great the decor is nice! I love the artwork! It seems to be a regular friendly type place but there was zero attention and very much a rush through the non regular person, I almost didn't get to order my breakfast before she started telling me the total for my coffee! Zero answering questions. I apparently am supposed to have the entire menu memorized on my first time there.   I love the renewable product cups, unfortunately the same doesn't apply to to go food containers:/   It looks like there are other coffee places I that complex. I'll likely visit another one over this one. The staff was not friendly or helpful in the slightest.

I hate to agree, but seriously has a health inspector been by recently?!   This is a neat place.. Or could be... But 50% or more of the games are marked broken.. The rest that we played malfunction... 3 "staff" working the rides that were working..  And as much as the 15/16 year old employees dusting fake trees helps.... This place is gross. Really want to bathe in bleach right now. But hey they keep from making eye contact if they looks busy with the plants.   I would seriously like to slap the owner. If shit worked and had a half decent staff I would be here almost every weekend.. He/ she could make a killing! But you can tell that ghetto rigging and teenaged employees are more cost efficient.

I have to say, this has been the best experience of getting an oil change. On the pricy side for sure! But for the immediate service and friendly staff I would pay it over and over. They let you know prices and ask your permission before doing anything with price included.   You don't get people ordinated car people often! Everything on my car ends up being more expensive than it should with it being so small, but rather than look annoyed as my car is a pain. They joked with me and got it taken care of.   They called many suppliers for my air filter that they didn't have in stock, we were not able to find one in the time I had avail. But that was no fault of theirs, they went above and beyond.    Every person that came through the door, the tech held the door for! You don't see that.

Let me just say I have never been to a harkins, this place was MASSIVE! So much movie going fun! Screw posters they have half movie size screens in the halls playing up and coming trailers! Everyone is wearing nice suits! What's that about?! But it looks sharp!   The theaters themselves are the usual... No road house style chairs or good food on demand, but clean and well kept.   We saw Peanuts on opening night in 3d, I mean who doesn't get ripped off going to the movies.. But it was fun.   The arcade accepts credit card for tokens... So I don't have cash excuse will not stop the kiddos here! But it was fun, those stuffy toy claw machines are more rigged than most!   We will definitely be back!

I am in love!! I only wish this was next door to my apartment!   The people are the friendliest I have ever met! So warm and welcoming! These people have service down! They restored my faith in phx area restaurants!  The building is pretty inside, very clean.   The food! We went with the more asian side of the menu, it was to die for but ya know with out all the death being vegan... Everything was very flavorful! I would say each dinner portion was more like 2 dinners for most people.   I highly recommend this even if your not veg! Do your taste buds, body and world a favor and eat lunch or dinner here! Seriously!

This place.. I love it! It's by far the cleanest and most decorated place that has "ericos" in the name! The staff is friendly and they always get my order right.   They have nice colorful paint and beautiful murals as well as nice art work. The tables and chairs are in good repair and matching.  I will switch up ingredients and they never get it wrong! Even on busy days!   The Mexican drinks are not made in house I don't think but pretty good none the less.

This has the greatest pizza... And I hate thin crust pizza with a passion! But this was the closest place in a new place so we gave it a try.. The pizza is so flavorful! I really can't express the greatness of this pizza it's easily 6 stars... Along with the host, he was so nice. The happy hour half price house wine would have been nice but she didn't ring it up correctly..  The only reason this review is not 5 stars is the service. I mean holy shit! I have never seen a waitress so unable to make eye contact or smile, let alone even consider making any small talk. She even took my water cup and didn't even ask if I wanted more.. 1.5 slices through our pizza she asks if we want a box... 10 min after it came out.. The place is. After we ordered desert she has someone else bring it out.. We were the only table. Then she drops of check I say thank you.. She walks away with out a word.. FYI I'm a great tipper min 20% this is the only time I will be leaving a shitty tip. We will get take out if we come back!

This place takes fast food to a new level! The staff is wonderful at this location!   It was one of those, I may just die if I have to cook dinner kinda nights... They are just up the street and have veggie burgers and grilled cheese for us non carnivorous folk.. And ice cream... Enough said!   There was not much of a line, we ordered took our number and sat down. They promptly brought our food to our table. The guy was so friendly, not the no eye contact here's your food type stuff you get at other fast food places.   We ate and went back for ice cream. This place is as unhealthy as they come. But it's fast and easy.. Like all places I wish they had more nutritious opinions and we would go more. But it's fast junk and sometimes that's just the case.

So I'm not from the area... And chipotle next door had a line that would take my entire lunch break... Jimmy johns didn't have a line at all. I see why! The food is gross! I mean really ew. It's bland and disgusting at the same time.. I really don't know how they do it!   The music was nice, they prepared this "sand which" quickly.. But left me wishing I would not have forgotten my lunch at home, and very sad I wasted 6$. Lesson learned.

Wow, I was really happy with them. I came in and had a groupon, I did not follow direction on the groupon and they still took it and helped me.   They didn't have my cars filter in stock, no one ever does. But they had it there and my car done in under an hour! My car is timely and a pain in the ass to be honest which is the only reason I don't do it myself.   They lady at the front knew what she was doing very well and was super down to earth. I think I'll be back even with out a groupon deal. I highly recommend this place!
