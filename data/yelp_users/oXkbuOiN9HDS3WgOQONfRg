This past Friday I was ready to head to Texas with my boyfriend for a family gathering. For once, I was ready to go bright and early so that we could make the six-hour drive before the holiday weekend traffic got to be too terrible. My car, unfortunately, had other plans.  The battery, which I had purchased less than a month prior, decided it didn't want to work.  We suspected it was a bad connection to the terminal but couldn't be sure. Instead of driving to Checker Auto, I decided to take the car a couple blocks away to Virginia Auto.  I have a few friends who regularly take their vehicles here for service, so even though I had never utilized their serviced, I felt confident about taking my car in.  At 8am, their small lot was already packed, and I snagged the only available spot.  We walked in and were helped right away.  The very nice lady at the desk asked if I'd made an appointment ahead of time and I explained our situation.  She said they had quite a few other cars in with appointments but she would see what she could do.  We sat inside the small lobby and chatted for a while before she came back in.  My brand new battery was dead.  It had been completely drained!  She said they could put the battery back in and we could go back to Checker to have it replaced or they could install a new battery for me.  Not wanting to take a chance on another bad battery, I decided to have them take care of it for me.  Not more than 20 minutes later, they had finished!  I wasn't thrilled about having to pay more than I wanted to, but it was worth every penny.  After we got to Texas that afternoon, my very car-savvy Dad looked at the  car and said the battery had been installed very well - it was in securely and everything had been cleaned up really well.  I need some serious maintenance done on the car, and I will absolutely be taking it in to Virginia Auto.  As soon as I do, I have no doubt I'll be coming back to this review to change it from a 4-star to a 5-star review.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Virginia Auto, for taking such great care of me and my car and allowing us to head out of town for a few days without worrying about my car!

Awful.  Gross.  Disappointing.  A co-worker and I weren't in the mood for Subway, McDonald's, or Einstein's, so we decided to try Chico's Tacos - a place I'd driven by many times but hadn't tried before.  The items on the menu looked decent enough, and I settled on the shredded beef taco platter and ordered it to go.  I got back to work and settled in to try my meal.  The tacos were actually not in pre-formed taco shells, but instead looked like they were freshly made and fried.  Sadly, there was hardly any meat in either, and most of each taco was the shell.  They had good flavor, but the fact that they each fell apart and broke onto the styrofoam plate below sort of ruined them.  The beans and ride were both inedible.  the beans were overcooked and had a slightly burned flavor, with a layer or congealed cheese over the top.  The rice was mushy and bland, except for the top-most layer, which was over-seasoned with cumin.  I was given a small bag of tortilla chips, and those were passable.  Including a large fountain drink, I paid $10.62.  I won't be back, especially when there's a Filibertos just down the road.

A friend and I decided to try this place after reading the wonderful Yelp reviews.  We were not disappointed!  There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said.  Our server was very pleasant, the place was clean, and service was quick.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals (he had the Plato Tipico, I had the bean & cheese pupusas with rice & beans) and look forward to returning for more.

Oh, how I used to love SunUp.  I was a fan when it was still Sonora Brewhouse, and I was a fan after the name change/change of ownership/whatever.  The waitstaff was always sort of iffy, but the patio was comfortable (when smokers weren't around), and the food was pretty consistent.  I was particularly in love with a new addition to the menu - the spicy pulled pork sandwich.  In search of a good place open on July 4th, I stopped in with a friend, already craving that delicious sandwich.  After waiting a couple minutes to be seated (and not even being acknowledged by anyone when we entered), we were led to a table by an older woman.  She took our drink orders and left us with menus to look over.  It took me a minute to realize they'd changed their menu.  Instead of one with appetizers, salads, sandwiches/burgers, entrees, and desserts, they instead now have a lunch and dinner menu.  And, sadly, the pulled pork sandwich had been discontinued.  I settled on the green chile chicken sandwich of some sort and an iced tea.  The waitress wasn't very friendly and seemed to be uninterested in being pleasant.  Our meals arrived but without the chipotle ketchup we requested.  A few minutes later, the waitress brought it to our table.  There was nothing impressive about my sandwich.  It was fairly blah and unseasoned, and the sweet potato fries were crispy on the outside but tough and hard on the inside.  Shame I paid $1 to upgrade from regular fries.  Once it came time to pay, the waitress took an exceptionally long time to return our cards and receipts to us.  My companion saw she was just standing around in the back not doing anything.  The place was pretty empty, so I don't really know why service was so bad.  I do know that the new menu leaves a lot to be desired, and unfortunately, I'll be hard-pressed to return in the future.

I have yet to be truly disappointed after eating at Oregano's.  I've experienced iffy service at the Mesa location, but the Camelback location has always been great.  I've always had to wait, but that's only given me the opportunity to enjoy a tasty, tasty Bellini in the meantime (damn you, Oregano's, for your two-Bellini cap!).  Service is friendly, the food is consistently good, and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed.  Please note that if you are dining with a group, the entire group must be present before you are seated.  I have only two complaints about this location:  !. Parking sucks 2. The floors are VERY slippery. Beware if you're wearing heels or shoes with slick soles so you don't fall like I did.  Let's end on a high note, shall we?  1. You know how I feel about the Bellinis. 2. Big Rig Pasta + chicken + hot wings sauce = YUM 3. I'll only share a pizza cookie with you if I really, really like you. Otherwise, that sucker's all mine!  I heart you, Oregano's!

I was first introduced to Giuseppe's a few years ago by a co-worker. I was sort of skeptical given the strip mall location and paper-covered tables, but I should not have worried.  Giuseppe's is tiny; there are a few tables outside and maybe only three times as many inside.  You order and pay at the counter and sit wherever you'd like.  The menu is written on chalkboards above and beside the counter and is pretty extensive.  From bruschetta to salads, sandwiches to pasta, the place has everything.  Alcohol is not served, but Giuseppe's is BYOB. I have never not seen the dark-haired lady at the counter.  I'm not sure if she's the owner, but she is very friendly and warm.  I have enjoyed on multiple occasions their gnocchi with Cardinale sauce (a mixture of red and alfredo) and today, for the first time, the meatball sandwich.  Both are wonderful and the sandwich is very filling!  If you ask, you can even get a basket of crusty bread and butter before your meal (free at lunch, $3 at dinner).  Prior to today's visit, I hadn't been to Giuseppe's in at least two years. I definitely won't wait that long before my next visit!

I've spending a lot of time with a friend who is a pretty serious coffee drinker.  A couple nights ago, we stopped in at Hava Java for a caffeinated beverage before enjoying some gelato next door.  Being the afternoon of July 4th, the place was empty, save for the barista and a guy who was in there chatting her up.  I ordered a cafe au lait, he an iced coffee of some sort.  After asking me if I preferred skim milk or 2%, the barista handed me my cup of milk and foam and told me the coffee was self-serve and pointed me in the direction of the three coffee dispensers on the other side of the bar.  Really?  $3.75 for a cafe au lait and I have to pour the coffee myself?  I suppose that wouldn't have been entirely terrible if it had been any good.  It's amazing how much difference whole milk makes, but even beyond that, the coffee was weak and flavorless, and since it had to be pumped over the weak foam and milk, my drink tasted like little more than a drip coffee with milk.  Lame.  Sorry, Hava Java - a repeat customer I will not become.  P.S. - A $0.25 "service fee" is charged to all credit/debit transactions.  Again, lame.

About six months ago, my Dad told me I needed to have my wheels aligned.  I kept putting it off, but last week I decided I just needed to get it done.  I searched Yelp, of course, and came across a few reviews for places near what would be my new office.  I finally settled on Jack's Auto Alignment & Brakes, called on Friday, and made an appointment to drop off the car today at noon.  A friend/co-worker followed me out to the shop, and when I get there, I spoke with Ken, the man who made my appointment.  He said the car would be ready by the end of the day and he would be happy to call before they started work if I so desired.  I told him to do whatever it needed and to call when it was ready to picked up.  I asked him if he needed payment before I left, and he said no - he wouldn't charge me for work he didn't yet know needed to be done.  Excellent!  Before I left, I asked him for a favor.  I had gone to get my emissions tested over the weekend, but because the emissions sensor thing under the steering column (that's a VERY technical term) had come unplugged, they couldn't do the test.  They said I could do it myself, but I couldn't figure out where the thing plugged in.  I asked Ken if he could figure it out, and thankfully, he was able to!  He didn't charge me to do this, as some places may have.  Very cool of him.  Another cool thing:  One of the guys noticed my friend's tires looked a little low.  He had her pull the car to the bay and filled them up for her.  It's those little extra touches that make a good place great.  Shortly after I returned to the office after dropped off the car, I had a message from Ken telling me the car was done.  They finished in less than an hour!  I called back and spoke with Ken and he told me only the front wheels needed to be aligned and told me I needed to replace the front tires sooner rather than later.  When I went to pick up the car, I realized I'd forgotten my debit card and ID at home.  Thankfully, I have my card number memorized and Ken was able to run it manually.  Again, very cool of him.  Before I left, he told me to have the alignment checked once a year and reminded me about the front tires.  There's no doubt in my mind I'll take my car to this place when I need to have my brakes replaced or my wheels aligned.  I'm a huge supporter of locally owned and operated shops, and I'm thrilled to add this one to my list and recommend them to anyone who needs their services!

There's not much more to say than has already been said, so I'll be brief.  Barb's is such a great bakery.  Their cupcakes are eye candy and taste even better than they look.  If you're a fan of red velvet, please be sure to try one of theirs - they are wonderful!  When they haven't sold out, Barb's decorated sugar cookies are awesome.  The cookie itself isn't very sweet, but the icing more than makes up for that.  Enjoy!

My sofa was delivered as promised without any real issues.  The sofa had a medium dirt smudge on the side despite being delivered in plastic.  I was told the delivery team would call me when they were 30 minutes from my place but they showed up without a call.  Regardless, they were friendly and efficient.  I'll be purchasing an occasional chair in the near future and I'll definitely make Pruitt's my first stop.

Upon the recommendation of a friend who has been taking her cats to Dr. Grant's office for years, I took one of my two cats in last February when he became sick with stomach issues.  Since then, I've recommended many people and have returned with my other cat.  The Scaredy Cat Hospital is not like other vet offices.  Dr. Grant and his team specialize in cats.  It's hard enough to take your cat to the vet when they're sick or just scared, but subjecting them to an unfamiliar vet office with barking dogs and non-cat smells can be, I imagine, pretty shocking.  At least when you take your cat to this office, they're faced with a bit less stress.  Everyone in the office is friendly, helpful, compassionate, and really knowledgeable about cats.  The office is decorated with cat items of every description imaginable, and there are even a few "office cats" walking around or lounging on cat furniture (or the reception desk!).  One of the best things about this clinic is the in-house lab and diagnostic services.  Many tests can be performed on-site, including bloodwork, urinalysis, x-rays, and vaccinations.  It's a relief to get back your test results while you wait instead of waiting a day or longer to find out what is going on.  Not only that, but each service is itemized so that you know exactly what you're paying for.  I would (and do!) highly recommend Dr. Grant and his wonderful clinic to any cat owner who is looking for a great vet.  I'm very happy to have been told about this wonderful office!

I've lived in Phoenix since 1998 and have heard wonderful things about Carolina's since then, and until today, I had never been.  My fiance and I stopped in today for a late lunch (around 2:30pm) and are so happy we did.  The place wasn't packed but it was busier than we expected.  We checked out the menu, made our selections, and ordered; he got the beef enchiladas and I got the flautas with beans & rice, plus a tortilla since they have such a reputation.  We only had to wait a few minutes before our food was ready.  IT didn't disappoint!  The flautas were crispy, the shredded beef was flavorful, and the sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese were just right.  The rice was really good, but I think I'll skip the beans next time.  My fiance's beef enchiladas were good and he finished them all.  The best part, though, was the tortilla.  Amazing.  Before we left, I picked up a dozen to enjoy later. Oh yeah, baby.

After my boyfriend had a positive experience getting his ear pierced by Ana, I decided to stop in to have my nostril pierced. After filling out some paperwork and selecting a stainless steel piece with a champagne-colored stone, I waited just a few minutes before Jeremiah called me back.  I have three tattoos, multiple ear piercings, and a pierced tongue, but I was still nervous about this latest piercing.  Jeremiah was a nice, calming force and explained everything he was doing.  Before I knew it, he was done and I hardly felt a thing.  Great experience!  I had a few issues with healing after the piercing and returned to the shop a few times so Jeremiah could take a look and advise me on how to get things back on track.  It's been three months and my nose is almost fully healed.  I'll be stopping in again to select some new jewelry and my boyfriend will be back soon, too, to have his other ear pierced.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this shop and its wonderful staff to anyone interested in a piercing.  Not only is the shop beautiful, well laid-out (love the remodel!), and comfortable, but it is immaculately clean.  You can tell everyone works hard to keep up the high standards the shop has set for itself.  Thanks, Halo and Jeremiah!

Pino's is a relatively new find for me, and I'm so glad my friend Brian was kind enough to suggest it for lunch one day.  The other reviewers are right about the parking situation - there's not much of it!  If you get there early enough, though, you won't have a problem.  I'm a fan of simple pizza: not too much sauce, lots of cheese, and a great crust.  Pino's offers just that.  And even better, two people can go in, split a one-topping, 10" pizza and each enjoy a huge fountain drink for just over $12 total.  That's a great deal and will keep me returning time and again!

Crazy Jim's is one of those old-standby places.  The service is typically always stellar and the foods you enjoy are always of the same quality.  I don't go too often, but when I do, I'm always happy I did.  I've only had a couple things on the menu: the teropita appetizer, the steak pita, the jalapeño burger, and the pepperoni pizza.  You can't go wrong with the teropita.  The soft, chewy dough is filled with a delicious egg and cheese mixture and is to die for.  I highly recommended you start you meal with this.  The steak pita is wonderful and what I always order - tender beef, grilled peppers, mozzarella, and grilled onions (which I always omit) on a wonderfully soft and delicious pita.  With it, I order a side of fried.  Do yourself a favor and order the fries extra crispy.  You won't be sorry!  The jalapeño burger is actually really great.  I don't know where they get their jalapeños, but they are always wonderfully spicy, sometimes EXTREMELY spicy, and always super fresh.  My only disappointing meal here has been the pizza.  I ordered it on a whim one day and was VERY disappointed.  I'm guessing it was an off day, as I've heard others rave about the pizza.  It didn't help that I found a hair on my first slice.  The waitress was very apologetic.  Not only did she comp my meal and offer to have something else made (I'd lost my appetite by then) but she also offered to give me a free meal on a future visit.  I declined the free meal, as I didn't feel it was necessary and knew I'd  be back again, but that went a long way.  This place is pretty small and gets busy during lunch and dinner time, so plan to go early or late.  Enjoy!

I was given a recommendation for Dr. McRunels by a friend's sister, and she had nothing but great things to say about him, so I booked an appointment for my husband and went with him on his first visit.  The small office is just a few blocks from our home, so the convenience can't be beat.  All of the staff is friendly and welcoming, which is a quality I value in a medical office.  From the start, Dr. McRunels made us feel at ease.  He's friendly, funny, down-to-earth, and really knowledgeable.  He asked all the right questions, didn't talk down to us, and took plenty of time to chat with us, both about medical issues and stuff in general.  In the year we've been seeing him, Dr. McRunels has been an excellent physician and we feel lucky to be under his care.  It's rare these days to find someone like him, but we're glad we did.

This place is awesome.  Nestled between a convenience store and an adult book store on Indian School and 31st Ave., you'll miss it if you don't know to look for it.  I was introduced to Angie's & Jimmie's by a co-worker, and I am so grateful!  This place is a dive, but the food is awesome, the waitstaff are friendly, and you get a ton of food for a tiny price!  I ordered the hot turkey and cheese sub.  I wish I had known to order the half sub, because the whole sub was ENORMOUS.  I was hard-pressed to finish half, and the other made for a very filling dinner later that night.  The fresh cut fries are wonderfully seasoned, and one serving is more than enough for two people to split.  My co-worker ordered the small order of wings (12) , expecting your run-of-the mill bite-sized wings, but what she got was a heaping plate of HUGE wings.  She was able to get through four of them.  As if that weren't enough, this place offers a monster-sized 28" pizza!  The same co-worker and I are heading back there today, and I'm looking forward to enjoying some pizza.  And fries, of course!

This review is for the salon part of this retailer.  I've been thrilled with the services of Karen, my stylist for almost three years.  She's knowledgeable, patient, and actually listens to what her customers want.  At the same time, she's able to advise based on her profession experience and the individual's hair type.  From what I've witnessed of the other stylists, they seem to hold themselves to the same level of service.  Over the years, I've only seen a couple new faces and have come to recognize more than a few of the stylists.  If you happen to find  yourself around Metrocenter and need a cut/wash/style (starting at $35), highlights or all-over color, or eyebrow wax ($20), consider stopping in to book an appointment with Karen or any of the other wonderful stylists.

I've been to Malee's three or four times, and each time I left full, satisfied, and feeling a lovely burn in my mouth.  Being in love with the Chicken Panang, it is the only dish I have ordered, but I have had bites of the Drunken Dragon Noodles, Crispy Basil Chicken, and Tamarind Chicken, and they are all exceptional - especially when made Very Hot or Thai Hot.  Service has always been efficient and friendly and the atmosphere is nice.  If I lived closer I would visit more often, but the trek to Scottsdale and the higher-than-average price make it easy for me to save Malee's for a monthly trip.  If you haven't been yet, you should.  Your mouth will thank me!

I had been wanting a second tattoo for years.  I decided this weekend I would finally have it done.  I asked a few friends for recommendations but didn't want to drive out to the far east valley.  After reading the first four reviews for Divinity, I checked out their website and the portfolios of the artists at the Phoenix location.  I was very impressed and called to make an appointment with Ryan Campbell.  When I arrived at the shop today, I was very impressed with everything I saw.  The decor was gorgeous, everyone was friendly, and Ryan was very knowledgeable.  He was very patient while I decided on the size and exact placement of my tattoo.  After he was finished, I was extremely pleased, and spoke to him briefly about my next tattoo.  I'm already looking forward to making my next appointment with him.

Last summer, my fiance started experiencing moderate to severe back pain.  Upon the recommendation of my cousins, we called and were able to make a same-day appointment at American Chiropractic Center.  When we arrived, we were greeted very warmly at the front desk by Susan.  In fact, we were greeted very warmly by everyone we met, from the X-Ray technician to Dr, Amoia, the man who would end up treating Bryan on each subsequent visit.  We have been really impressed with the service and level of care we have received on the many visits we have paid to this office.  We have never had to wait more than five minutes for a scheduled appointment, everyone remembers our names, and when Bryan had to cancel an appointment upon the advice of the doctor he saw at urgent care one weekend, Dr. Amoia via a call from Susan called to check on him and find out what was going on.  It is clear that every doctor, technician, and therapist we have seen take great pride in what they do and truly care about the well-being of their patients.  Thank you, Drs. Amoia and Genet and everyone at American Chiropractic for the wonderful work you do and treatment you provide!

I don't think I have anything to share that hasn't already been posted in previous reviews.  The food here is stellar - quality ingredients, great flavor, and nothing cookie-cutter. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Service is friendly, quick, and everything one should expect.  I absolutely love visiting this place and encourage you to do so, as well, if you haven't already. I am one of the lucky ones who has never had to wait more than 60 seconds for a table - I'm not sure how that's worked out, but it has, and I'm grateful. That said, I would gladly wait an hour to enjoy some great breakfast fare at Matt's. I'm looking forward to trying lunch one day, too!

Is it possible to have a crush on a coffeeshop?  This place is, by far, my favorite new discovery in ages.  I've been driving past it on my way to and from work for ages but never had the time to stop in.  I have friends who rave about the place and go regularly, so I really wanted to check it out.  I finally did this past Saturday (5/31) and I scolded myself for not having done so sooner.  My friend and I found a parking space out back in the tiny parking lot and walked in not really knowing what to expect.  One patron sat at a table with her laptop and the rest of the place was empty.  The friendly girl at the counter took our orders and gave her own recommendations for cool drinks.  I took her up on her suggestion of a peach smoothie.  It was wonderful - like drinking pureed peaches!  I took a sip of my friend's latte and knew I would be ordering one of my own at some point in the near future.  Before taking our drinks, my eyes lingered over the cupcakes on display; I must admit I drooled a bit.  Because it was such a nice night, we sat outside and enjoyed our drinks.  It wasn't long before more people showed up.  A group of older folks joined us outside and a few other groups and couple settled inside.  My mind kept going back to the cupcakes I saw earlier, and I ended up going inside to buy one.  My choices were vanilla, red velvet, lemon, and strawberry (I think).  Not only were the cupcakes quite sizeable, but they had sprinkles - goldfish and piggies!  Very nice touch.  I ended up selecting a vanilla funfetti cupcake with bright blue icing and goldfish sprinkles.  It wasn't anything spectacular - just a cupcake made from a box cake mix - but it was a very nice treat and that much more special due to the fishies.  I know - it doesn't take much to make me happy.  I've since been back twice and have used the very convenient drive-thru.  The first time, the man who came out to greet me asked if I had my stamp card after he took my order.  When I told him I didn't, he told me he would give me one, and he did - along with three stamps!  that morning I had another peach smoothie and decided to try the red velvet cupcake.  The smoothie was just as ood as the first, but this cupcake was VERY tasty - much better than the vanilla funfetti.  I stopped again this morning and ordered a vanilla latte.  That sucker far surpassed the vanilla lattes I usually get at Starbucks.  I love supporting local businesses, and I'm only too happy to return to Copper Star time and again.  I suggest you do, too!

After learning about a special rate celebrating the 40th birthday of Ben, the hotel owner, I booked two nights at The Clarendon, the first in July the second in November.  I had visited the property once before, a few years back when the restaurant on the premises was under different management; I was left with the impression that the hotel looked really cool and fun and I made a mental note to check it out sometime.  With the special deal I found, I decided now was the time.  I booked a Jr. Suite for both nights, and my first stay was last night.  I checked in early before my boyfriend arrived.  Rachel helped me check in and was really friendly and helpful.  I took  in all the details as I walked to the elevator and then to my room.  Really fun, local tilt-shift photography was hung on the walls leading to my room (#221).  I wish I had snapped a few photos of my room, because it was really fun - a great king-size bed with a funky, upholstered headboard, dark-wood heavy furniture, a plush occasional chair by a lamp, a long desk/dresser, a 42" (if not bigger) TV anchored to the wall, and awesome blue walls made up the room.  Unfortunately, I noticed the room hadn't been cleaned properly.  By the Keurig coffee maker, I found a mess of opened sugar packets, creamer, and used swizzle sticks, and no  cups or coffee.  I called down to the front desk and Rachel answered.  I told her what I found, and she came up to check it out.  She seemed sincerely disgusted at what she saw and she was very apologetic.  She left the room and came back with some cups and went down once again and this time returned with coffee, tea, and a wet rag to wipe down the counter.  She also brought a few bags of chips, some candy bars, and four bottles of chilled water.  She asked me what else she could do to make up for the mess, but I told her she'd done enough - more than was her responsibility, actually.  Later that evening, after a pretty dismal experience at the Gallo Blanco Cafe, in the hotel lobby, I stopped at the front desk to request some extra towels and some sugar for the coffee.  Ben, the owner, happened to be at the desk at the time and told me he heard we'd had a bad experience at the restaurant and asked how our stay had been otherwise.  I told him about what happened before in the room and complimented him on having Rachel on his staff.  Like Rachel, he was very apologetic and asked what he could do to make up for it.  He also told me it had been Rachel's first day, and I couldn't have been more surprised - what an asset to his team!  Before we went back upstairs, Ben gave me his card and asked me to let him know when we'd be staying over again so he could upgrade us to a full suite.  He then came by the room with a huge stack of freshly laundered towels (they were still warm!) and apologized again and thanked us for our patience.  Talk about customer service!  When we checked out, Rachel was back at the front and asked about how our night went.  I recapped for her the rest of the events and she again thanked me for our patience and good nature.  This is why I support local businesses, especially when they hire amazing people who know how to treat their patrons and guests.  For the wonderful customer service we were given, I'm rating this hotel five stars.  Ben and Rachel, THANK YOU for being great.  I look forward to our next stay, though I wish I didn't have to wait until November!  P.S. - The amazing AC in the room? What a delight!

Siu Wok has been a favorite for quite some time.  Sadly, today's experience knocked them off the list.  My co-workers and I decided we needed a tasty meal today so we placed a delivery order through Siu Wok.  We were happy when the meal arrived much sooner than the 45-minute delivery estimate.  Our food was hot and smelled delicious.  We were all enjoying our food when one co-worker made a stomach-turning discovery: a dead fly in her food.  We all immediately stopped eating, repulsed by the large fly nestled up to a sliced carrot.  I immediately called Siu Wok to complain and spoke with Jennifer.  I told her what happened and asked for a refund on the entire order.  She said she could refund the contaminated meal but would have to speak with the manager for authorization on the other two.  She called back a few minutes later and said she was only given permission to refund the $7.95 for the extra-protein meal.  She seemed to understand why I was disappointed but said her hands were tied.  I asked her to relay to management that I was very disappointed in his lack of attention to the matter and that Siu Wok had just lost a considerable amount of business, as our office frequently places orders there.  Instead of Siu Wok being out $23.44, they have lost an office full of customers and gained a negative Yelp review.  Doesn't the fly look delicious??

Fuego Bistro is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, if not my #1 favorite.  I was asked to attend a surprise anniversary dinner there a couple years ago, and since then I have returned many times for lunch and dinner.  Everyone has mentioned the food and how wonderful it is, and I am in complete agreement.  The Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes and Jalapeo Creamed Corn are amazing; I would go for those sides alone!  The appetizers are generous and the drinks are delicious.  Great all-around.  I will assume the generous portions have left the other reviewers too full to even consider ordering dessert; that's the only reason I can imagine not mentioning them here.  On my first visit, I ordered the Pastel de Tres Leches and fell in love.  The huge slice of cake wasn't your run-of-the mill Tres Leches.  It had an amazing mango or guava filling between each slice of cake and was pure heaven.  Also wonderful is the fried ice cream, banana empanada (I'm not certain that's what it's called), and the key lime pie.  So good!  My one and only complaint about this wonderful place is that they will not under any circumstances split the bill.  They will allow you to use multiple credit cards and cash, but you have to do the math on your own.  This is only tricky when you're with a large group, but even then, it's well worth it when you've enjoyed an amazing meal, tasty drinks, and were given top-notch, friendly service.

Gelato is one of those things that makes up for a crappy day or a long week.  It also makes a great night out even better.  The Gelato spot has so many delightful flavors, from the rich and decadent chocolate varieties to the tangy fruity flavors.  You can sample the flavors to find the one which suits your mood best or you can stick to what you know you love.  Service is usually friendly and fast, but there are the usual girls behind the counter who look and act like they would rather be anywhere else.  Fortunately, I have had more good experiences with these girls than bad.  Gelato... it's like a hug for your tongue!

Without getting into a long, drawn-out account of our visit to this establishment, I will share the following.  Arriving with an ill family pet, we were greeted with warmth and kindness by the front desk staff.  We didn't know how long we would have to wait, and we were told that because of the nature of an emergency pet clinic, there were no set appointments and no way of knowing how long each appointment would take.  We were fortunate to only wait a few minutes before being shown to an exam room.  After only a few minutes, a tech came in to check on our kitty and not only treated her with a very tender manner, but was kind to us, as well.  We waited a bit longer after that before we saw the vet, but once we did, we did not feel rushed in the least.  Dr. Brantley took as much time as we needed to discuss all of our options, her personal and professional opinions, and to help us feel as ok as possible with our ultimate decision.  Having a regular vet whose staff and policies we are familiar with, it was a little intimidating having to go to a new place especially during such a delicate time.  Thankfully, every person we dealt with was kind, attentive, thorough, and really wonderful to deal with.  I hope we don't have occasion to visit this emergency clinic again, but if we do, I will feel confident in my decision and that the care of my pet will be of the highest quality.  Thank you, Adrienne, Mark, and Dr. Brantley, with all our hearts for being so wonderful with us and our sweet kitty The Wookie in her final hours.

I have been in love with Red Hot Robot since I discovered it a couple years ago when it was over on Central.  I have never gone in and left empty-handed.  My bank account is always at least $20 lighter, but the smile on my face and the goodies in the black RHR shopping back more than make up for that.  I finally visited the new digs today, and even though it's a bit further from my home and office, I'm so glad they found such a lovely new space.  It's bigger and better-showcases all of the wonderful treasures.  The selection of cards and postcards is bigger than before, which, in my opinion, is a HUGE bonus.  The usual vinyl blind box collectibles are still available and there are so many other awesome little goodies.  I have never asked his name, but the really nice guy who always rings me up (the owner, I believe) is always super friendly and seems genuinely concerned about how well his shop is meeting his customers' needs.  When I went in today, I asked him about the new Android figurines and he gave me all kinds of fun information about them and when they'll be available.  It's refreshing to be able to talk to a shop owner and get the feeling you're just having a nice conversation with a friend.  Today I spent my $15 birthday gift certificate, which I'd been holding on to since January, and spent another $35 on top of that.  Best way to spend a Friday if you ask me!

Switch has been one of my absolute favorites since they've been around.  I have had the pleasure of gathering with friends for birthday dinners here year after year and many happy hours, dinners, lunches, and brunches.  I don't think I have ever had a bad experience, and I usually leave thinking that visit was better than the last.  I've gone to Switch for dates, and while the place is always boisterous, it always feels intimate and private.  The decor is beautiful - lots of blues and browns with gorgeous local art hanging on the walls.  It's just an all-around great place to visit!  My favorites:  - The Blonde Sangria.  Hands-down my favorite drink in CenPho. - The hummus & pita, especially with lots of roasted red peppers. - The Cowboy Burger.  The BBQ sauce is just perfect. - The $6 carafes of screwdrivers & mimosas during the weekend brunch. Need I say more?  The staff is exceptionally friendly (and unusually good-looking!), service is always top-notch, and the food & drinks are awesome.  I'm a Switch fangirl for life!

I went in this afternoon for a mani-pedi.  The shop was empty save for a woman at the nail drying table and one getting a set of acrylics.  The gentleman doing her nails took a couple minutes to acknowledge me standing there and once he did, he grunted to me to write my name on the clipboard.  He then yelled toward the back for someone to come out to help the new customer.  Having forgotten my own bottle of OPI nail polish, I selected one from the display on the wall and sat in the pedi chair as instructed.  My tech, "Jennifer," was friendly enough but hard to understand.  She listened to what I told her about my pedicure and did a nice job.  Partway through she told me she would do a spa pedi (including callus remover, a paraffin foot treatment, and hot stone massage) and mani for $40.  Perfect.  My feet ended up smooth and the polish looks great.  I can't say the same about my hands.  I asked her to file my nails straight across, not curved, but she didn't listen.  She left red polish smudges all over my fingertips and seemed put-out when I asked her to clean it up.  She smudged the thumb and instead of removing the polish and redoing it, she just used the clear topcoat to smooth it out.  I ended up coming home, taking the polish off my fingernails, and doing my nails myself.  I may go back for a pedi, but I'll stick to doing my manis myself.  Definitely not worth $40 combined.

Thanks to Yelp and the wonderful reviews I read, I booked Camelback Moving for my first move in seven years.  Lisa was wonderful over the phone, answered all my questions, and have me all the information I needed when I called to make the reservation about a month in advance.  As luck would have it, I hit a major speedbump just twelve hours from my scheduled move and called the company in tears late one evening to find out what I could do given my current situation.  I believe I spoke with Chad, who listened patiently and did a great job of assuring me they would work with me to get everything taken care of.  When I resolved everything the next day and called back to confirm a new date, Lisa recognized my voice right away and was really great.  The day of the move, I got a call from one of the guys asking if they could start early, as their other job finished ahead of scheduled.  We agreed on a time, and true to their word, they arrived when they said they would.  When they arrived, one of the guys went over some paperwork with me and asked him to walk them through my place showing them what would be going.  After that, they got started.  I was absolutely impressed by the speed at which they moved everything out, especially considering they took time to wrap all non-boxed objects with huge rolls of Saran Wrap-like plastic - including my sofas and ottomans!  They finished moving everything downstairs and to their truck in under two hours.  Had they been able to park closer and not have to deal with the stairs, I'm sure they would have finished sooner.  Once at the new place, they got started unloading.  If a box wasn't clearly labeled, they asked where it should go.  They re-assembled my bed and put the furniture where I asked.  Not a single box was misplaced.  Nothing was broken.  Everything was in the same condition it was in before it left my former residence.  Once everything was done, I was given another form to sign along with a comment card.  Before they left, the guys even asked if I needed help shifting things around or if I wanted things moved anywhere.  Truly great customer service!  Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone at Camelback Moving for making this a completely stress-free moving experience.  I have already and will continue to enthusiastically recommend this company to friends and associates for their moving needs.  I can't say enough about them and will absolutely use them again next time I move!

I was shocked when I discovered I hadn't yet reviewed Maizie's.  Time to fix that.  I have a bit of a crush on Maizie's.  Well, a bit more than a crush, really.  With the exception of one app, I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I've tried here.  The sweet potato fries are definitely the best I can find in Central Phoenix and I really, really love the Strawberry Tallcake - sweetly sinful!  My biggest gripe with this place is the service.  There are three or four waiters (all men!) who are always, without fail, truly outstanding.  The women, however, have been reliably less-than-stellar.  I don't know why there seems to be such a split in level of service, but I've come to expect it.  The women have never been outright terrible, but they are less friendly, slow, and a lot less responsive than the men.  Last time I was there with a friend (his first visit), one of the women who appeared to be a manager-type instead of a server, hovered around our table and watched us while we ate.  It was very unsettling and made us both a quite uncomfortable.  Odd.  I'm going to Maizie's tonight and am already looking forward to enjoying the "Attitude Adjustment" (Happy Hour) specials and a really great meal.  My fingers are crossed for a great server!

A friend and I stopped in today, not realizing it's usually closed on Mondays.  The owner, a super-friendly and very delightful man, let us in anyway and fixed us up with some tasty, tasty shave ice!  My fuzzy navel wasn't exactly peachy or orangey, but it was very good, and my friend's mango was really, really good.  I look forward to stopping in again and trying other flavors.  We were told the shop will be moving to 7th St. & Bethany sometime between now and mid-August.  Will defintiely stop by the new digs.

I have visited As You Wish twice, each time with my mom and favorite cousin.  The three of us went in the first time not really knowing what to expect but felt pretty sure we would create masterpieces.  Not so much.  First of all, about the place.  The shop is really nice - colorful, organized, and welcoming.  The employees are friendly and helpful and do a great job explaining everything you need to know on your first visit.  Even though the store is pretty spacious, it can be a little tight in there, especially when all the tables are full and people are milling about selecting pottery, paint, switching out water, or asking staff for help.  That said, the tables are a good height and the chairs are pretty comfortable.  Be warned, though - if you have more than three in your group, a four-top table will be a very tight squeeze.  On my second visit, my cousin's husband joined us, and between all of our pottery, 3-4 bottles of paint each, two bowls of water, brushes, sponges, and paper towels, we didn't have any room to spare.  Thankfully, we didn't spill or drop anything, but we came close.  If you're visiting for the first time and have no experience paining pottery (or painting anything more than a wall, really), and/or are lacking artistic inclination, here's some advice: don't select a "blank canvas" piece.  I know, all of the pottery is plain what.  What I mean is don't select a gigantic plate or a trinket box.  Select something with "guides," like the cupcake or robot.  On our first visit, my cousin and I each selected a trinket box.  We both had visions of creating masterpieces.  In reality, I ended up with a black box with hints of blue and purple swirled around.  Hers was no better,  We knew better when we went back.  I went with the dragon and was able to use the raised and contoured areas as guides for paint placement.  It was so much easier than trying to design something on my own, and let me tell you - the finished product came out so nicely!  So those are my two cents.  Having a girls' pottery painting party has become tradition for us and I'm already looking forward to going back.  Even if your first pottery piece comes out like my ugly black box, it's worth it for all the laughs you'll have with the people you're with!

America's has, by far, the best bean & cheese burritos in the valley.  It's huge, cheesy, messy, and is almost as good as my Grandma used to make.  Today I scored an XL bean & cheese burrito, chips & salsa, and a large iced tea for under $8.  Service is really, really friendly and even during the height of the lunch rush, they're fast!  Love it!

I spent the better part of my afternoon today searching Yelp for a good nail salon.  Summer has arrived in Phoenix, so naturally, I'll be wearing flip-flops and open-toed shoes more often, and my feet were in serious need of a pedicure.  After finally settling on V-K Elle based on the great recommendations, I headed over without an appointment.  Upon arrival, I was greeted by a friendly male nail tech.  He asked what I wanted and then asked me to pick a color.  Once I did, he asked me to take a seat in the first pedicure chair.  I waited a good fifteen minutes before a tech became available, and it was around that same time they turned on the water and allowed me to soak my feet.  Tina was assigned to me.  Though her English was pretty poor, she was friendly and reserved.  She asked if I wanted my toenails trimmed then went to work.  The only other question she asked was whether I wanted to pay an extra $5 for the callus remover treatment, to which I said yes.  She scrubbed the hell out of my feet, which they desperately needed, and shaped my toenails nicely.  After she rubbed my feet and legs with a scrub of some sort, she spent quite a while massaging lotion and oil into them.  It was nice; I'm not a fan of really deep massage on my shins, and she didn't go overboard.  I could have done with a deeper massage on my calves and feet, but I could have spoken up about that.  Once she was done, she rinsed me off and applied the color I'd chosen (a gorgeous, deep, red OPI which had, unfortunately, lost its label).  After she slipped a pair of disposable flip-flops on my feet, I paid her ($25 before tip, which included the callus remover treatment and polish) and waited a few minutes for the polish to dry.  As I was waiting, the same man who had greeted me came by, thanked me for my visit, asked my name, and asked me to please return.  I definitely will!  A few things to note:  Pro: Tina and the male tech apologized a few times for my having to wait so long.  That was considerate of them.  Con: While I was still on the chair with my feet resting on the bench waiting for the polish to dry, Tina tried to clean the tub while my feet were still up.  She looked at me like wasn't sure what to do, so I offered to get down and instead sit on the manicure chair beside me.  There wasn't anyone waiting behind me, so she could have waited the extra five minutes I was there to clean her station.  Con: There's a tacky sign on the wall which encourages customers to pay their tips in cash.  This isn't a forced policy, thankfully, but it made me roll my eyes a bit.

Mojo Yogurt is full of win. Why?  1. You can sample all the flavors before deciding which one(s) you want.  2. Great flavors, including dairy- and sugar-free options.  3. Topping bar! Yeah, there's the standard fruit and candy, but there's also cereal! How awesome is that!?  4. Rotating flavors! While it hurts my heart that pistachio isn't a permanent flavor, it's fun to see what is available each week (hint: follow Mojo on Facebook and/or Twitter to find out which are the flavors of the week at each location)  5. Speaking of Facebook and Twitter, the folks at Mojo are awesome when it comes to social networking. Not only are they funny, clever, and never over-the-top with lame or excessive posts, but they make it a point to be personal and reach out to the Mojo lovers in their own community. I know I'm just another customer, but the fact that someone replies to my tweets and even comments on my crazy screaming kitty icon makes me feel like I have a small voice... and that customer service is really important to this company.  6. And while we're talking about customer service, the people at the counter are great! They didn't even make me feel silly the first time I cashed in my Tuesday word of the day!  7. The Tuesday word of the day grants you 50% off your entire purchase when you mention the word to the cashier. Half-off yogurt? Yes, please!  This place has a great business model going on, and they're doing everything right when it comes to customer interaction, customer service, and reaching out to other local businesses.  I have only two complaints:  1. I've chosen peanuts and almonds as toppings on two separate occasions. Each time, the nuts were bad. there's nothing worse than rancid peanuts on your coconut yogurt or stale almonds on your pistachio yogurt.  2. There's not a downtown location near my home!  Keep up the greatness, Mojo - you have a lifelong fan in me!

This past Friday night found me wanting a way to unwind after a crappy day.  A friend suggested pizza, but neither of us were in the mood for the usual.  He searched Yelp and came up with The Parlor and its great reviews.  we decided to give it a shot.  We showed up around 6:30 to a packed parking lot.  There was a long wait for a table inside, but we opted to eat on the patio and were immediately seated (after, of course, a Scottsdale mom and and old dude each cut in front of us).  Our waitress was Lisa.  She brought us water and made drink recommendations.  The drink special of the night was some sort of watermelon/vodka/lime juice concoction, which she highly recommended.  I took her up on that while my friend ordered a Blue Moon Hefe (on tap).  My drink was AWESOME!  I expected some sort of syrupy-sweet watermelon-flavored drink, but what I got was real, pureed watermelon!  Really good, really refreshing... and really refreshing at $9!  It was worth it.  After mulling over the menu, we decided to split the spicy BBQ chicken pizza, sans green onions.  We waited a short while before our pizza was brought out.  To my dismay, I noticed green onions all over the pizza.  We flagged down our waitress and asked for a new one.  True to her word, just five minutes later we had a fresh pie.  This pizza was, perhaps, one of the BEST I've ever had.  The crust wasn't too thin or too thick, the BBQ sauce was wonderfully flavorful and just enough, and the serrano chiles were really hot.  The 12" was a perfect size for the two of us to split.  We weren't overstuffed but weren't left hungry, either.  For dessert, we ordered a seasonal fruit crostata, which that day was nectarine.  It was served with a small scoop of vanilla gelato.  this was a fantastic end to a perfect meal.  The fruit was sweet and tart, the crust was flaky and sweet, and the gelato tied it all together.  Altogether, our bill came out to $49 and change, which I felt was a great value for a meal that included three drinks apiece, pizza, and dessert.  Oh, and the pizza?  We're both still talking about and craving it.  I'm looking forward to my next visit!

Smeeks is awesome. It's the kind of place you want to visit when you're down, feeling nostalgic, have a sweet tooth, need to buy a unique gift, want to have your photo taken in a photo booth, want to buy a fun toy for your desk at work, or just feel like checking out the new/seasonal inventory.  What's best is that Smeeks is locally owned and staffed by some really great people.  I have rarely been able to get out of Smeeks without spending less than $20.  It's not that everything is really expensive, although some stuff is a bit pricier than I'd like, but it's all unique and tough to find anywhere else.  It's just that you want that cool set of erasers, and some of that candy you loved as a kid, and a new keychain, and some cool wind-up toys, and some bacon-flavored lip balm (yes, you read that right), and... the list goes on.  Next time you're near Central & Camelback, stop in and treat yourself to something special, even if it's a little something . It'll put a smile on your face for the rest of the day!

After a long day and a longer week, I agreed to fetch the BFF from the airport in exchange for dinner.  We initially decided on Maizie's, but when the entire lot at the Landmark was full, we circled around to the adjacent complex and decided to try Hula's instead.  The patio was full, but we were immediately seated inside.  Our waitress Victoria was quite charming and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu while we chatted.  After a few minutes, he decided on a beer and I asked for a passion fruit iced tea and the Zombie - a delightful combination of rum and fruit juices.  After we ordered, we sat back and enjoyed the ambiance.  The indoor seating area was empty, but a group of four was seated beside us.  I wasn't sure about the close seating with connected tabletops, but it really wasn't so bad, even when a group of four was seated right beside us.  I excused myself to use the restroom and was happy to see it was clean and non-smelly.  A short while later, our meals arrived.  We both ordered burgers - his was beef and had mushrooms and mine was Ahi, and of course, we both ordered the sweet potato fries.  Unfortunately, they were undercooked!  We let our waitress know, and she took our plated after apologizing.  She returned minutes later with our burgers and a promise of a fresh basket of fries for us to share.  The fresh batch of fries was much better - hot, crispy on the outside, and perfectly cooked on the inside.  I think Mazie's are better, but these were definitely good.  Our burgers were each served on really nice, thick buns with sesame seeds.  I can't speak for my friend's meal, but my burger was wonderful!  I asked for no slaw and the sun-dried tomato pesto aioli on the side.  The aioli had a really nice flavor and tasted great on the burger.  The ground tuna seemed to have been combined with diced serranos which gave it a really, really nice flavor and a bit of heat.  Despite being stuffed, we each finished our meals and sat talking for a long while after.  Our waitress was super-attentive and kept the iced tea and water refills coming steadily.  Nice surprise: after the bill was paid, she brought us an order of shrimp rolls.  She said it was an incorrect order but wanted us to have them since we were so great.  I'm not a fan of shrimp, but the rolls looked and smelled delicious.  I tried some (sans shrimp) and loved the flavor of the toasted coconut flakes and the really great pineapple dipping sauce.  I am very much looking forward to returning to Hula's again and again.  Lunch service will begin on November 1, which seems too far away.  Great service, great food, great ambiance - love it!

I recently moved to the Coronado neighborhood and was hoping to find a good alternative to my favorite Melrose coffee shop.  a friend told me about Urban Beans and how great it was.  I didn't make it in during the holidays, but I finally did yesterday.  The place is really spacious, bright, and inviting.  There are plenty of tables and chairs and it looks like a great place to study, read, or  hang out with a friend or two.  I ordered a cafe au lait to go.  The nice guy at the counter asked me what ratio of coffee-to-milk I wanted and what kind of milk I wanted.  While the traditional cafe au lait is equal parts coffee and steamed whole milk, I don't always want lots of coffee flavor, so I found it thoughtful that he asked.  The display case had lots of different goodies, and had I not just purchased some delectable creme brulee from Torched Goodness, I would have chosen a treat.  I have been told they also serve sandwiches and have some of the best hummus/veggie plates.  I'm really looking forward to trying that!  My heart still belongs to my old coffee shop, but I think I'm going to really enjoy stopping in at Urban Beans.  Hooray!

I was out to lunch last week when I noticed a 12"+ horizontal crack on my front windshield.  Great.  After I returned to the office, I searched Yelp for windshield repair shops and this was the first listing with the best rating, so I decided to call for an estimate.  Never having dealt with a cracked windshield, I didn't really know what to ask, so I told Kelly, the very nice gentleman who answered, I was in his hands.  He asked me to describe the crack and told me that since it was longer than the length of a dollar bill, I would need to have the entire windshield replaced.  A time and date were scheduled and I was given a quote on the replacement glass.  Additionally, I was given a lot of great detail about the kind of glass being used and why inferior glass was never used.  I felt as though I was in good hands and had made a great choice with this company.  Furthermore, Kelly was just a really personable guy, didn't make me feel stupid with the questions I asked, and made me feel like he truly appreciated my business.  After a couple appointments opened up, Kelly called me today and asked if I was able/interested in having the repair done today instead of tomorrow.  I verified the time worked and made the appointment for this afternoon.  About thirty minutes before that time, a very friendly woman named Nikki called to let me know the tech would be at my office at noon.  About ten minutes before noon, I took my car to the side lot to wait for him and he showed up right as I did!  Freddy was very nice, explained he would need an hour to replace the glass, and promised to call when it was done.  Not even 45 minutes afterward, he called to let me know he was done!  He went over a few things with me, called in my credit card number, handed me my receipt, and left!  The new glass looks flawless (I don't think my front windshield has ever looked cleaner!) and will be completely set in an hour.  I highly recommend Kelly and his wonderful team at Gorilla Auto Glass.  I hope I don't have to replace any of my car's windows again, but if I do, I will definitely call this company.  Thank you, Kelly!!

I live a mere three blocks from this wonderful place, yet I've only been twice.  Don't ask me why, though, because I don't have a good answer.  Both visits were very nice.  More than nice, actually.  On each occasion, I was met by different baristas.  Both were super-friendly and chatted with me while they prepared my order.  It's a very refreshing change of pace when you meet a stranger who seems genuinely nice and makes you feel like they actually like you.  Lola's employees make me feel this way.  I'm the sort of person who will frequent a business with great customer service even if the goods they offer aren't the best.  At Lola, I get both!  On my first visit, I ordered a Cafe Au Lait and some sort of decadent cupcake.  Both were extremely tasty.  Today's coffee was a latte, I believe, with caramel and white chocolate.  So, so good.  Mind you, I know nothing about coffee except that I generally hate Starbucks and prefer my coffee light and sweet.  And bonus? A raspberry bar on the house.  It was one of the best raspberry bars I've ever had.  The other night, I took a friend to another local favorite coffee house.  I'm looking forward to taking him to Lola next time we hang out.  And I'll definitely be stopping by Lola more frequently on my own!

I first went to a Pita Jungle over three years ago and wasn't impressed.  Earlier this week, a friend and I met at the Downtown Phoenix location for my belated birthday dinner.  Wow, has my opinion changed!  Service was great.  The ambiance was really comfortable.  The food was delicious.  What I appreciate most was our server's honesty.  I went in knowing I wanted baklava.  When I asked him if it was good, he said no.  I asked if he just didn't like baklava or if it was truly not good.  He said it was truly not good and recommended the carrot cake instead.  It may sound inconsequential to be so impressed about someone's opinion on dessert selection, but I thought it was really cool.  and the carrot cake?  TO. DIE. FOR.  Thank you, Anthony!  I went back yesterday with my cousin for lunch.  We arrived close to 12:30, at the height of the lunch rush.  We went in, gave our names, and waited just a few minutes for a table.  Again, service was great, even when we asked for extra pita, refills, or took forever to make up our minds.  This place  has quickly risen to the top of my favorites list!

I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said, but I wanted to throw my five stars in the pot.  I'm thrilled America's opened this second location!  I wasn't sure the service would be as friendly as it is at the other location, but it definitely is.  As expected, the new place is cool, decorated wonderfully, and is a great spot to visit with friends or swing by to pick up a quick order after work.  If I could throw an extra star to this location, I would.  Why?  I think the salsa is just a touch better, spicier, and more flavorful than it is at the 7th St. location.  Either way, I love this place!

I love Culver's.  Their burgers are among my favorite, the cheese curds are delicious, and their peanut butter Concrete Mixer is sinful.  Unfortunately, service at this location is exceptionally lacking.  I placed a drive-thru order for the food items mentioned above last week during the lunch hour.  I was asked to pull forward to wait for my meal, and I waited... and waited... and waited.  I waited for a full 20 minutes before my meal was brought out to me, only to find it was incorrect.  The server who brought the food out to me stared at me like he didn't know what I was saying and then told me I was mistaken.  When he saw I was, indeed, correct, he took my food bank in and I waited another five minutes for my meal.  At that point, already late getting back to work, I left.  Imagine my dismay when I got back to my desk and discovered my meal was wrong yet again.  It was my fault for not checking once again before leaving, I know, but seriously?  I'll stick with the Metrocenter location despite it being a few miles out of my way.

I just realized I wrote my review of Divinity Tattoo and posted it to the Scottsdale location (duh!), so I'm moving it here.  I plan to return very soon for my next tattoo and am sure my second experience will be as great as the first!  Originally posted 1/19/09 I had been wanting a second tattoo for years.  I decided this weekend I would finally have it done.  I asked a few friends for recommendations but didn't want to drive out to the far east valley.  After reading the first four reviews for Divinity, I checked out their website and the portfolios of the artists at the Phoenix location.  I was very impressed and called to make an appointment with Ryan Campbell.  When I arrived at the shop today, I was very impressed with everything I saw.  The decor was gorgeous, everyone was friendly, and Ryan was very knowledgeable.  He was very patient while I decided on the size and exact placement of my tattoo.  After he was finished, I was extremely pleased, and spoke to him briefly about my next tattoo.  I'm already looking forward to making my next appointment with him.

Dr. Thurman and the entire staff at Desert Sage are just wonderful.  My first experience with this clinic was in 2011 when I accompanied my then-boyfriend on a visit for his (our) dog Roxxy.  We didn't spend a long time there, so I was astounded when, a year later, I returned with Bryan, now my husband, and Dr. Thurman remembered me!  Her good memory has nothing to do with her skill as a veterinarian, but it certainly made me feel as though she really cared about her clients and tried hard to make everyone feel welcome and important.  I have since been back many times with each of our four pets.  During each visit, Dr. Thurman is friendly, thorough, knowledgeable, and really great with our pets.  She also remembers details from previous visits and follows up without prompting.  It's really great to feel confident about the care provided to our pets.  All of the techs are just great with the animals (and with nervous pet-parents) and the front office staff is always courteous and efficient.  All of our pets (read: the cats) don't appreciate going to the vet, but we actually look forward to going since we're always treated so well.  While it's not the main reason we take our pets to Desert Sage, we are glad that their prices are far cheaper than other clinics (and Petsmart), and we appreciate that we're never bullied into getting services we don't absolutely need.  Thanks, Dr. Thurman & staff for taking care of us and our pets!  :)

I'm a fan of well-done, simple, no-frills burgers, and Smashburger is just that.  A co-worker and I just came back from a wonderful lunch and I'm completely satisfied.  I opted to build my own burger and went with a 1/2lb. burger on the chipotle bun with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, mustard, and chipotle sauce.  I'm not a fan of a lot of spices on my fries so I went with the regular.  A cold cherry coke made my meal complete.  I was told it would be 5-7 minutes before my order was ready, and not more than five minutes later, it was brought out to our table.  Not only was the presentation really nice, but the burger was out of this world!  It was cooked just as I like it (well-done) and was really hot and juicy.  The fries were good on their own, but paired with the chipotle sauce, they were near perfect.  The awesome food coupled with the friendly, efficient service ranks Smashburger up in my top three favorite burgers in town.  Well done!

My first experience with Five Guys was in DC and at the time, I wished for a location to open in Phoenix.  Wish granted!  My Mom and I visited the new place this week and I was not surprised to see it as busy as it was.  I had the burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, jalapeños, and bell peppers with cajun fries and Mom had the hot dog with bacon and onion with regular fries.  We could have easily shared one small order of fries and I didn't make it through half of my burger, but what I did eat was perfection.  I was also thrilled to enjoy Cherry Coke!  If you're looking for a quiet spot to eat  your meal, avoid this place.  It's loud and hectic, but that's part of its charm, I think.  The people at the counter were really friendly and smiling, which was good to see.  Bonus?  A clean restroom!  I'm looking forward to returning to try the hot dog!

Creme brulee is one of those desserts I'd always heard about, was sort of familiar with by description but had never tried until a couple years ago.  I've since had some really good creme brulee and some really bad.  Let's place Torched Goodness in the "really good" category!  A work friend mentioned last year how amazing TG's lavender creme brulee was.  I thought that was an odd flavor for this dessert but she raved about it.  I happened across the TG truck at T&C one Wednesday but the line was way too long so I didn't stick around for a taste.  The same friend invited me and another co-worker to join her at the Downtown Public Market site for "Food Truck Friday" and we all hoped the "creme brulee guy" would be there.  Sure enough, he was!  Lunch was great, but dessert was better.  There were four flavors available that day (vanilla, lavender, chocolate-peanut butter, and salted caramel).  We each got a different flavor (we didn't try vanilla) and shared.  Wow - really wonderful flavors!  I didn't expect to like the lavender, but it was surprisingly nice.  I don't think I can choose a favorite between the chocolate-PB and caramel, but I will say the flecks of sea salt on the caramel makes it spectacular.  I have since learned Torched Goodness is at Urban Beans on 7th St. & Osborn every Tuesday afternoon from 4-6pm.  It just so happens I live blocks from there and can easily stop in on my way home from work.  This could be a love affair in the making!

Upon the recommendation of a colleague, my co-worker and I decided to check out the goodies at Maui Dog.  We were greeted immediately upon entering with a friendly, "Aloha!" by the young woman behind the counter.  She asked if we had been to Maui Dog before and when we told her we hadn't, she handed us menus and told us a bit about the food and how to order.  We could build out own hot dog or select from a "Shaka Dog" - one of their six creations.  After asking a bit about the different sauces and toppings, we made our selections: the Island Dog for me and the Sunset Dog for her, plus tater tots and drinks (free refills).  We paid, got our drinks, and sat down to wait.  The decor is pretty simple but not at all boring or even gaudy.  Hawaiian and island-style memorabilia adorned the walls.  The tables and chairs are very basic but are comfortable.  My friend and I took note of the patio seating outside (which overlooks Indian School) and agreed it would be a nice place to sit when the weather finally cools down.  Only a few minutes passed before our food was brought out to us on a large tray.  I don't think either of us swallowed our first bite before remarking how delicious it was!  My dog was stuffed with an all-beef hot dog (I chose that instead of the standard all-beef brat) and was layered with juicy pineapple, shredded coconut, chipotle garlic mayo, and Maui mustard, which was one of the most delicious sauces I've ever tasted.  I wasn't sure what to expect when she described it as a passion fruit mustard, but wow - I'm a fan.  The whole thing was topped off with a generous helping of crumbled, extra-crispy (my request) bacon.  The flavors all worked incredibly well together - sweet, spicy, salty, tangy, fruity, meaty - it was an amazing mix of food synergy.  The tots were really great, too - super crispy and flavorful in a way I can't describe.  It's almost as though they're fried in a flavored oil.  Everything worked so well together.  Midway through our meal, our waitress stopped by to check on us and make sure everything was ok.  We assured her, though full mouths, that all was very well.  Even though I was full, I had to get some shave ice to go.  I have a thing for shave ice and feel compelled to get some anytime I find it.  After looking over their very long list of flavors, I settled on tiger blood (cherry-coconut) and passion fruit.  If I have to identify something at this place which is sub par, it would be the shave ice.  It certainly wasn't bad, and the favors were very nice, but instead of using a large frozen block of ice, bags of ice cubs/chunks/pieces were used.  I'm not an expert on the mechanics of shave ice, but I have a feeling this led to the very chunk consistency of my icy treat.  It didn't stay light and fluffy like most shave ice does, but instead turned into something similar to a convenience store Icee.  That's my only gripe, though, and it's not one which will prevent me from going back and enjoying some more shave ice.  We overheard the owner talking with other customers while we ate.  Some things to note: They are working on getting the drive-thru up and running.  Call-ahead orders are welcome. Online ordering is in the works.  For a place that's only been open for six weeks, this place has the makings to do very well in the area.  Great job, Maui Dog.   I look forward to going back again soon!

I've been looking forward to trying this bakery for a while now, and today I finally did.  I expected the cupcakes to be expensive, but I was still bowled over by the $3.50 price for a single, very average sized cake.  The selection was pretty good - everything from the standard chocolate and red velvet to peanut butter and cherry.  I asked the woman at the counter for her recommendation and she said everyone seems to love the red velvet but her personal favorite was the Tropical Vacation, which had coconut and a pineapple filling.  I purchased my cupcake and took it back to the office with me to enjoy.  I was impressed by the packaging, and I suspect that's where the bulk of my $3.50 (plus tax) went.  The plan white cube had an interior cupcake tray so the cupcake wouldn't go sloshing around.  It was a nice touch.  I just finished eating my afternoon treat, and here are my thoughts:  - Average size - Heavy, but that's due to the huge amount of very heavy frosting - The consistency of the cake was very nice - not dry, not too dense, just right - The coconut flakes in the cake itself was a very nice and unexpected treat. - I expected the cake to be coconut flavored, but it wasn't - it was just a white cake. - The pineapple filling had absolutely no flavor aside from "sweet" - Way too much frosting.  The sugar overpowered whatever little bit of flavor the cake or filling may have provided. - The frosting itself was way too dense.  I was able to pick it up and break off a piece without it getting messy or falling apart.  I really, really wanted to love Cupcakes by Design and would have gladly paid $3.50 for a really spectacular cupcake, especially when the flavor selection is really unique, but I can't imagine I'll ever go back unless their prices drop by a couple bucks.

I love Jimmy John's. I love Jimmy John's so much I used to drive clear out to Baseline & Rural from my home in Downtown Phoenix just to get a tasty sandwich fix.  Guess what! I don't have to drive far at all now!  The newest Jimmy John's is open just eight blocks from my office in the Camelback corridor.  I've been waiting anxiously for this shop to open, and when I noticed today that it's up and running, I knew what I was having for lunch.  I took with me a co-worker who is a self-proclaimed sandwich lover.  We went around 11:30am ready to enjoy a tasty sub,  Upon entering, we were greeted enthusiastically by the ten or so people standing around and behind the counter.  It was a bit surprising, but not in a bad way.  You could tell the staff was trained to be friendly and welcoming to all who entered - each patron who came in after us was greeted the same way.  I knew what I wanted and ordered right away and my co-worker made her selection, as well.  As expected, I hadn't even finished filling my drink before my #16 Club Lulu (no mayo, add cheese) was ready.  We sat down with our sandwiches, ate, and talked about all of the different sandwiches they have available.  Jimmy John's never fails to meet my expectations.  The sandwiches are tasty and filling, the service is friendly, and fast, and it's a meal definitely worth every penny!

I don't have a lot to say beyond what has already been said, so I'll briefly share a few things my dinner companion and I made note of:  The Good - Great looking spot in the esplanade, right off the ground-level parking behind the escalators - Comfortable seating (we sat at a two-top) - Nice, dim lighting - Excellent food.  His chicken street and my barbacoa short rib tacos were outstanding - Free homemade chips and salsa - Nice happy hour pricing  The Bad - The red sangria was horrid. There wasn't any fruit in my friend's glass.  The wine tasted cheap and not at all fruity like a sangria should. - The music belonged in a nightclub, not a casual establishment in CenPho.  Like my friend said, they need to create an identity for this place and play music that suits it, not just blast some loud house crap. - The music was WAY TOO LOUD.  We used a $10 Groupon and split the remaining $29 bill.  Great value for two dinner platters and two drinks.  Our waiter, whose name I didn't catch, was friendly, attentive, and made sure our water glasses were always full and checked in on us often, but not too often.  I look forward to returning!

I try to stay away from Starbucks whenever I can.  For the longest time, the only coffee shop within walking distance from my office was Starbucks.  No thanks.  A few weeks ago, a co-worker told me about a new place that opened at the Biltmore, which excited me - especially when she mentioned it was another Royal!  Already a fan of Royal at the Market, I knew I'd be in for a treat.  Not knowing where the shop was located, we parked near Paradise Cafe and walked through the courtyard until we ended up back out on the south side of the shopping center and found the shop on the lower level of the Red Door Salon.  The space was clean, bright, and simple.  Upbeat (but not obnoxious) music played over the speakers.  There were only a couple actual table with chairs but a few benches and many stools were set up on the wall by the bar.  The place looked ideal for relaxing, reading, or studying.  Two baristas were at the counter and greeted us warmly.  I ordered a large cafe au lait and my companions each ordered coffees.  We only waited a couple minutes before our hot drinks were ready.  Because it was still too warm, I waited a few minutes before tasting.  The coffee was good, if not a bit too dark for my liking.  It certainly won't stop me from going back, though - I'll just ask for slightly more steamed milk than coffee.  As I type this review, I'm kicking myself for not also getting one of the very tasty-looking pastries in the display case.  I won't make that mistake next time.  I'm looking forward to many happy returns to Royal at the Biltmore. Thanks for making it possible for me to enjoy a quality, non-Starbucks coffee during the work day!

I love Kitchen 56.  Love.  A friend suggested this place for happy hour one afternoon, and I'm so glad she did.  I'd heard of the place but knew nothing about it, so before we met, I looked at their website and made a mental list of the things I wanted to try.  None disappointed!  First of all, the place is adorable.  It wasn't at all what I expected, but I loved what it ended up being.  From the outside, the place looked simple and welcoming.  Inside, it's open and casual, and decorated really nicely, from a large mural to fun wall decor.  Seating was available at the bar, tables, or booths by the windows.  Upon learning it was my first visit, the server assigned to my table was welcoming and enthusiastic and was quick to recommend drinks and menu items.  My first drink was one of their signature adult lemonades - the black cherry.  It was ridiculously delicious from first sip to the last few amarena cherries left in the bottom of the glass.  I could have easily enjoyed a few of these drinks, especially since they didn't taste like they had alcohol in them!  I had the pink panther next, and while I enjoyed it, it wasn't nearly as good as the first.  Since I was two drinks in, I decided a bit of food would be a good idea, so I tried the black bean dip with tortilla chips off the happy hour menu (it seems to have rotated off the menu, sadly!).  It was SO GOOD and I was disappointed when we finished it.  For dinner, I went with the griddled corn cakes topped with pulled pork.  This was the best thing I'd eaten in a long time!  It was served with two sauces, both of which perfectly complemented the flavors of the corn and pork.  Definitely my favorite.  There's nothing I didn't like about this place, except maybe that it wasn't closer to my home.  I look forward to visiting again and again!

After passing this place many times with my phenomenally filthy car I finally stopped in today after I saw on Foursquare that a friend had just taken his car.  I pulled up to the attendant's station and looked over my options.  A friendly guy came out, asked me if it was my first visit, and explained how things worked.  The basic wash is $3 and the "deluxe" is $10.  He also explained I could buy a monthly pass for any of the four wash types and get unlimited washes.  I told him I'd heard about that and would make a decision after my first wash.  He gave me a wet microfiber cloth to wipe down the interior of my car, gave me my choice of air fresheners (cherry, vanilla, baby powder, and new car), and my receipt - which he explained I could bring in within the next three days for a free wash if I had reason to be unsatisfied or if my car got dirty again... no questions asked!  He then directed me where to go.  The wash took all of three minutes.  It was a standard touch-free car wash with super-strong air dryers at the end.  Once I was done, I pulled around to the vacuum station.  After I emptied my car of entirely too much trash, I started vacuuming the floors.  The vacuum at the station I pulled up to had terrible suction, so I moved to the next one over, which worked perfectly.  It was at that point I noticed two things: 1) the wash hadn't completely cleaned my car of the bird crap on the windshield or the bug guts on the front bumper, and 2) I hadn't been told about the bug treatment station which would have pre-treated my car for said bug guts just before pulling into the wash tunnel.  Good to note for next time.  Thanks to a properly functioning vacuum (which reached easily around the car to the passenger side doors), I got the interior clean in no time.  After wiping down the dash and console, the rag I was given was pretty dingy, but thanks to the handy sinks at each vacuum station, I was able to rinse it off and continue cleaning up.  All-said, it was $10 well-spent.  Upon a friend's suggestion, I'm going to take the car to be properly detailed and get one of the middle monthly packages at CleanFreak to take care of the regular washes.  I'll definitely be a return customer!

Yes, yes, yes. Bill Sandweg has done it again.  I have been in love with his  glorious coffeeshop, Copper Star Coffee, for years. When I heard him mention a new BBQ joint earlier this summer, I tucked away that bit of information in the back of my mind and waited patiently to learn more about it.  The soft opening of Circle H Barbeque was this past Monday, and today, my fiancé and I stopped in today for lunch.  Right off the bat, we were pleased to see a few cars in the lot, including three Phoenix Police vehicles. I don't know what it is, but Phoenix PD always seem to know of the good lunch spots, so seeing them there already was a nice treat.  Upon entering, we were greeted warmly by  Clarissa, my favorite barista from Copper Star.  It was so nice to see her there in the hostess role.  We chatted briefly and she took us to our table.  While we waited for our server, we admired the restaurant. Thankfully, it doesn't look like a Taco Cabana any longer!  The floors are polished concrete, the tables are rustic-looking wood four-tops, each branded with the Circle H logo.  Above, the beams are exposed.  There's also a patio, which  I'm anxious to enjoy.  After looking over the menu and drooling over each item, we placed our order with our server, who was very friendly.  He told us about a few things on the men and explained that a few weren't yet available, such as the three-layer Dr. Pepper cake.  I am  SO looking forward to trying that once it's available!  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwich and Bryan ordered the Brisket sandwich, each with fries.  After waiting only a short while, our food was brought out in little plastic baskets lined with checked paper.  The sandwiches, served on warm, soft potato buns, were piled high with meat and had a bit of sauce already on, with a small ramekin of extra sauce on the side.  They were each accompanied by large servings of really delicious fries.  In short, the food is amazing.  Both meats were tender, flavorful, and had a really gorgeous smoky flavor.  And the BBQ sauce?  Wow.  So, so good.  Tangy, sweet, and just really, really good.  We are both excited to try so many other things on the menu!  Our bill, which included two sandwiches and two drinks, came to just $21 and change. What a bargain!  Word to the wise: Arrive hungry.  The portions are generous, and even if you're full, you'll fight to finish every last bite.  Yeah, it's THAT good.  Also, try dipping your fries in the BBQ sauce. Heavenly.  Bill has done a really great job with Circle H and we are so excited to introduce it to family and friends and to visit often.  Keep up the great work!

After a long afternoon out shopping, my fiancé and I decided to stop into the recently opened Jersey Mike's for a quick bite. We'd both heard rave reviews about this place from his sister in-law who frequents it out in the East valley.  We were looking forward to finally trying it out for ourselves.  The restaurant is in a neat little corner plaza surrounded by other great eateries, all of which share a really great courtyard patio with lots of community-style seating.  We entered the establishment from the courtyard, which is technically the back of the shop, and walked in to see what was in store for us.  The place was clean and brightly lit, with music blaring from the speakers.  It was definitely too loud, as we had to fight to not only hear each other, but also the people at the counter.  After we were greeted, I had to ask the counter people to repeat everything at least twice.  Not good, especially when my fiancé overheard a girl on the prep line say to another customer that she couldn't hear what they said on account of the music.  After we decided on our sandwiches, we placed our orders and moved through the line.  I ordered a hot sub, the chipotle Philly chicken cheesesteak (or something to that effect) and my fiance ordered a turkey & provolone.  We were handed a ticket which only had my order written on it and it took us a minute to figure out they only write the hot sub orders and have you go through the assembly line for cold subs.  It took a while to get through the line; there was one girl adding toppings to the cold subs, one guy standing by waiting to wrap the finished subs in paper, and another girl running the register.  In addition, one woman was running the hot sub station on her own, the manager-type was taking cold sub orders, and another guy was mopping the floor (Really? With customers in the store?).  Something happened at the register, and I had to stand there for ten minutes waiting for my receipt.  By that time, we had my fiancé's sub but were still waiting for mine.  The woman running the hot station started calling the name Roger. When no one responded to that name, she came out onto the floor and started asking everyone personally if they were Roger.  She just kind of stood there looking confused, so I thought to ask her what kind of sub she had prepared.  Turns out, it was my sub.  The name we had given, which was also on the ticket, was Bryan.  Yeah, not even close.  By that point, we'd been in there for close to 20 minutes and were very underwhelmed by the service we'd been given.  We took our food home to (hopefully) enjoy it.  The subs weren't bad.  They weren't great, either.  I expected my hot sub to be full of flavor and spice, but instead it was just a chicken sub with peppers, a bit too much cheese, and not much in the way of the chipotle mayo that should have been on it.  Bryan's turkey and provolone wasn't anything to write home about.  The bread on both of our sandwiches was average - soft all around and soggy with all of the condiments.  Neither came close to being as great as Jimmy John's, and for what I paid, I would go to Subway over Jersey Mike's.  I really hope this place makes some improvements to their customer service, and at the very least, they should turn down the music a few notches - that might help with the communication issues.

I have been following Piefection on Instagram for well over a year,and even though I only live a short 30-minute drive from the shop, I had never been. I read about today (10/3/15) being The Big Day when Piefection was serving samples of all their seasonal flavors, so my mom and I decided to have a date and go out there. The shop is small but adorable, decorated in pink, black, and white. A few small tables and chairs lined the exterior and the glass display cases showcased the gorgeous pies. A large blackboard hung on the wall behind the counter and listed all the flavors and prices. We were able to sample all the available flavors, which included two apple varieties (dutch and crumb, I believe), three pumpkin (sour cream, praline, and traditional), and salted caramel. I'm not a huge fan of apple pie, but they were both good. The traditional pumpkin was nice, but I didn't care for the sour cream. The two stand-outs were the pumpkin praline and salted caramel. We even purchased a whole of the former and a slice of the latter to bring home. While there we also split a slice of pecan which was good (the crust was amazing!) and bought individual chicken and green chile pot pies to enjoy at home (I tried the chicken and it's so good, if not a little underseasoned). Enjoy was the gal behind the counter and she was super friendly, and we also meet Cheryl (the owner) who stopped to talk with all the customers in the shop. I'm at once regretful and grateful that I don't live closer to this place, because I'd be there far too often. However, Mom and I already have a date to return next Saturday when they will have single slices of ALL the pies available for purchase. Can't wait!
