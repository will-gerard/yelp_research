If you don't like La Tolteca, just go to Taco Bell for the rest of your life, because you obviously don't enjoy food. Your eating privileges should be revoked, in fact.   THIS IS MY FAVORITE Mexican place in the ENTIRE COUNTRY, and if you look through my reviews, it's quite obvious that Mexican food is my #1 reason to live. The menu selection is HUGE. My favorites are: The Shrimp Tacos.. SO GOOD. Big hot corn tortillas, with gigantic grilled spicy shrimp, red & green bell pepper, and onions. Their Chile Rellenos are simply the best I've ever had.. They are egg dipped, stuffed with perfectly melted cheese, and the peppers are huge, spicy and ROASTED. *dies* YES. None of that soggy baby food tasting relleno you may find elsewhere. This is the real deal! Papas taco is great, Elotes are awesome, etc etc.. The only let down has been the Fish taco.. it's just kinda dull.. but why eat that when there are the OMFG FALL OVER SO GOOD shrimp tacos. Also the environment is unique, festive, and cheery, and the staff are great too.. the owner is a doll.. I just love her :D Before I forget.. THE SALSA BAR.. Absolutely the best salsa in Phoenix, and if you can't deal with heat, then go cry about it somewhere else.. There are several types and styles ranging from mild to BURN YER TONGUE OFF, and there are also roasted chiles and that marinated trio of carrots, cauliflour and something else I can't remember right now :P  I'm not even going to start about the desserts, cuz they speak for themselves..

I absolutely loved my experience at Pane Bianco. I spent a long day of working, drinking, and making merry at the Phoenix Pride Festival, and decided I'd find much better food while I wandered my way over to the bar....  Such great food I found! I ordered a Margherita Pizza and a bottle of coke... While the price felt a little steep for the volume of food received, the quality of the pizza, as well as the AMAAAAAAAAZING AMAZING AMAZING FANTASTIC staff ultimately made the $20 I threw down feel like a value!  I was impressed by the speediness of service for a Saturday evening, and enjoyed the environment on the little patio outside.

I had not  been to a barber in years... YEARS. the at-home bowl cut just wasn't working for me anymore, and the Flowbee died... I could kick myself for not purchasing that extended service plan, way back in '92. But anyhow, this leads me to last Friday afternoon.. truly, it was happy-fun day! I WENT TO A REAL BARBER. It was amazing. Luxurious! Indulgent. and I haven't felt hotter in years. There's flat screens built in to each station at this barber, showing sports, and Russian television. Russian Judge Judy? You may see it here. It's great. The staff is friendly, manly, and professional, and they do great work.

OMG SO IT WAS HAPPY HOUR and I was meeting a hungry friend at the bar who wanted to EAT PIZZA. I hastily scoured yelp for a decent place to grab a pizza in Central Phoenix, and Pizza Heaven jumped OUT at me!! Better yet, there was a 50% off any Pizza coupon in The Entertainment Book!! WOO! I was greeted by a stylish and friendly staff, pizza was ready within 20 minutes of my phone call, and WOW!! Such a great pie!! Fresh basil in the sauce!! A mix of nice cheeses! Great pepperoni!!! Exquisite crust!!! I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT MOAR.

Maybe I'm ordering the wrong stuff, but I've *always* been disappointed in the grub at 5&Diner... The service was STELLAR and I really do like the ability to dine Al-Fresco at 3am, but does everything need to be soaked in butter flavored crisco??? ughghg.

TACOS TACOS TACOS. FINALLY. The BEST Carne Asada, I have ever had.  I tried the Bombero Burrito - $4.95ish with Green Chile pork inside. SPICY. AWESOME. The burrito is served Enchilada style, with a smoky chipotle sauce on top + cheese. an awesome burrito, and a great value! The real gem at this little place though are the Carne Asada Street Tacos ($1.15 each!) . Perfectly marinated meat, not greasy, high quality, and served on the most delightful little corn tortillas.  I've eaten a lot of BAD Carne Asada in my life, and I'm thrilled to finally find a place that makes it so well! My co-diners had Shrimp Tacos, and a combo plate that had a tamale, enchilada, rice and beans.. both of those were under $7.... they were good, but I'll say again, Carne Asada is the *star* at Los Taquitos. I even had a few more Tacos for dessert. :P   Bright, joyful, warm staff... seats are tiny, and so is the dining room.. but I'd sit on the side of the freeway to eat food from here, if I had to. :) IT IS SO AMAZING.

THE HOLY GRAIL HAS BEEN FOUND. High end Asian buffet, Sushi that is ALL YOU CAN EAT, AND MADE TO ORDER!!! YES, that's RIGHT! FRESH MADE! You go up to the dude at the sushi bar, and pick whatever you want off of the menu, and he makes it! YES! wow! Also, the food end of the buffet is top notch! MOUNDS OF TEMPURA. So thankful for finding the great reviews here on yelp!  Prices aren't too bad either - 15.99 on Friday or Saturday night, a bit cheaper during the week, and under $10 for lunch. ALSO if you mention yelp, you get $5.00 off the bill for 3 or more!!! Service was impeccable! Very clean, nicely laid out, etc.. I CANNOT WAIT TO RETURN.

My favorite stop for fast food fried chicken! The spicy chicken is the greatest, and so are the biscuits.. The mac and cheese also wins, but the portion sizes of the sides served with the family meals could be WAY BIGGER. C'mon  Popeye! Don't skimp on the cajun rice and beans, yo!

I love having QT so close to my home. I give them an automatic 5 star rating, only because I am hopelessly addicted to their Iced Tea. I only wish they had bigger cups to put it in.. 52 oz? NOT ENOUGH! :) I wish I could run a hose from their Iced Tea container, through the irrigation ditches in my neighborhood, straight to my home. :D

this is very bland, Americanized Mexican food. I had the stacked enchiladas, with fideo as a side.... i gotta say the fideo was REALLY good, but.. well. it's hard to mess up fideo!  Otherwise, the salsa tastes like raw tomato sauce, the enchiladas were far less than spectacular, and the guacamole we ordered was similar to what could be had at any grocery store. There are so many more exciting, fresher tasting, less expensive Mexican eateries in the area, so I don't have any plans on returning to Rosita's.

Trader Joe's is great. I love this one because the staff is REALLY friendly, and it never gets unbearably crowded. I've encountered a few situations where items which are regularly stocked staples were sold out, but all-in-all I've had numerous positive experiences here.  One thing to keep in mind with any perishable products from Trader Joe's, is that since most of it is very natural food without extra preservatives, etc, is that it tends to expire quickly.. Be sure to check expiration dates before buying an item, and eat em up fast! :)

This is certainly not the place to take cans...BUT for copper? You can't beat this place.. after few visits, I've made at least 30% more than I anticipated.. The situation is efficient, and the staff is friendly and professional. Parking can be a bit awkward, and there's nothing pretty about this place, which is why I love it. I want to live in a scrap yard, when i grow up. :D

Updating my review to 5 stars: I'm glad Anthony D. of American Metals explained the price paid for aluminium cans, below. The price does seem very fair with explanation, and as mentioned before, I feel American Metals Company is the best choice for a metal scrapping service in the east valley.

Third time here in the past three weeks if that says something :) Big big fan of their Teriyaki Chicken, Bulkogi Beef, Shredded Pork (Lualua, I believe) and Katsu Chicken... Compared to L&L this place kicks some MAJOR ass... I dream of their macaroni/potato salad.. I cry for it in my sleep! :) lol! :D  my only issue is that they don't seem to offer free refills.. I could be wrong however.  An absolute MUST try if you like hawaiian, or korean style food.

Aloha Kitchen is an endless source of incredibly awesome, well made delicious yum-foods! I've dined here countless times, and have tried all sorts of things from their surprisingly varied menu... When I was a carb whore, I used to go full hog on the Teriyaki Bulkogi Plate, and I'd ask for an extra side of the Macaroni Salad (it's SO GREAT), and savor each grain of their super sticky white rice.. Now that my diet has changed a great deal, I'm a bit more of a salad guy, and I'm thrilled to report that Aloha Kitchen has possibly the best salad I've ever had: The Chinese Chicken Salad.  It's huge, inexpensive, super fresh, tasty, and crispy. It features a truckload of Teriyaki Chicken, some fried noodle crunchies, slivered almonds, mandarin oranges, and a variety of really awesome leaves.  The dressing is exquisite too! I'm concentrating on the details of the salad, because it doesn't seem to get the attention it deserves in other reviews.. but as my love affair with salads grows deeper, and more serious, this may be the salad in which I judge all others against  Along with all of their other WOO HOO yay plates, if you're there while they've got Spam Masubi on the counter, GRAB IT. Or three.. I never knew SPAM could taste soooo amazing. Restaurants like Aloha Kitchen are a huge part of what I love about living in the Phoenix Area: Honest, amazing, affordable food that's served by independent establishments. OH AND: Their seafood anythings are also SO GREAT! They are also masters at the art of fried foods. Woot!

The last review I wrote was for Pane Bianco... now I move on to DEL TACO, cuz that's just the type of guy that I am!  Why 4 stars for Del Taco? For a chain taco joint, the taste, value, and service are unbeatable. 39c tacos, everyday! That's less than $4 for 10 tacos!! Quite the meal if you're broke! I've always loved the Del Classic Chicken Burritos, as well as the chicken soft tacos too. There are always spectacular deals, and the staff members at this location are particularly friendly and efficient. Also, this location is much cleaner than other Del Taco's I've experienced!

Lately I've been on the Mary-Kate & Ashley diet... but every so often, a man needs to gorge himself on carbs. When I decide to eat with reckless abandon, Barro's Pizza is usually my very first choice on the list. Their hot wings are the best I've had on this side of the Mississippi, and the pizza is everything a thick crusted vehicle for sauce, melted cheese, and crispy pepperoni should be.  To top it off, this particular location is fairly vast in size, has all sorts of flat screens showing all sorts of sports, and the friendliest, most attentive staff I've ever encountered at a casual pizza place. Finally- an XL 1 topping pizza 24 hot wings, and 3 drinks rings up somewhere under $32. Yes. Yes. Yes. :D

This location KICKS SO MUCH ASS. It's chill, the people are friendly, AND they actually have more tobacco products, and supplies than the big location at Mckellips and Hayden... (at that location, everyone seems to be treated like THEY ARE a shoplifter.) It's worse than going to BestBuy!

Gross. Filthy. In dire need of remodel. All utensils, dining surfaces, fixtures, trays, etc are in need of replacement.  The ignorant, un-enthused staff member did not fully explain the choices available as she handed us dingy steel bowls, and charged about $12.00 a person for them. . I also was WAY NOT COOL with what seemed like gallons of water being added to my meal as it was cooked on the grill, ultimately creating a disgusting soupy mess of a dinner.  I was not interested in finishing my meal, and HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR A TO-GO CONTAINER AND A BAG.  Finally, when it comes to the soup... Do not, for your life, eat this trash. It's days old meats and veggie bits... So rancid. So gross. If you look at my other reviews, I tend to focus on the positive aspects of my dining experiences, but unfortunately the negatives at YC's Mongolian Grill were many.  I highly suggest NOT eating here.

Perfect.  Flawless.  Euphoric.  Those are just 3 words to describe the amazing Thanksgiving brunch I enjoyed today with my family, at Top of The Rock.   Each item of food that I tried (and I tried just about all of them) was exceptional. Usually at an all you can eat thing, there's a few letdowns, but there weren't any at Top of The Rock.   The scenery was absolutely brilliant. If the weather permits, sit on the patio, and enjoy one of the most fantastic views in The Valley.  The service was *stellar*. Our waitress (I think her name was.. Jamie?) was one of the best I've ever had. So was the turkey, and all the other stuff! The sushi was great too, and put many restaurants which specialize in sushi to shame. The desserts were almost too adorable to eat. I'm pretty sure I tried about 6 of the various custards, crème brûlées, tarts, and mousses. The desserts are made in house, by one obviously amazingly talented pastry chef. Typically such desserts taste kinda.. soapy, and trucked in... absolutely *not* the case here. The flavors, caramels sauces and everything else were exquisite, and again that applies to the main dishes, and sides served. No corners were cut, and I am going to be smiling for days. I can't wait to return to Top of The Rock for more fantastic experiences in the future.

I love you, NuTowne! The dirt lot. The endless array of amazing kitsch on the walls. The hella cool patio, some amazing legit metal sculpture. the mannequins. The Sunday beer bust, which is probably one of the most vibrant regular day drinking events in the region. The hugs from Daddy Ron.  The theme parties, including a luau and superhero party! The occasional blackout parties too! THIS is the coolest and most interesting gay bar in Phoenix. It's genuine, wacky, always fun. The location is perfect for me, as I'm in the East Valley.. I wish more people would migrate over from Central Phoenix more often to appreciate the awesome that is NuTowne!

After taking a rather long pause from uhm.. *everything*, I've recently resumed fraternization with other men, in situations that involve beer consumption! Since I've lived in Phoenix, Pat O's Bunk House has always been one of my favorite places to get slizzard, and or #STUPidFACEDD. There's always a friendly, social crowd, from morning, 'til night!  The patio is my favorite feature of this bar, as I am a self proclaimed patio hussy, and Bunkhouse's patio does not disappoint!  Great happy hour, specials, etc!

While my visit, to pick up take out was kind of drunken blur, the amazing food I ate from Diamond's after a few hours of harder than intended  drinking were JUST what the doctor ordered. My buddy did all the ordering, so all of it was a surprise, when I sat down to eat.  Quite possibly the best Hot-and-Sour soup I've had IN MY LIFE, and all of the everything else that was ordered, was smack yo' mama good. The fried rice, and lo-mein were divine (especially cuz it was a big diet cheat for me) and the EGG FOO YUNG = EGG FOO YUM. I've had much more bad Egg Foo Yung than I have had good Egg Foo Yung.. to the point that I never think to order it, cuz it usually SUCKS, but SO NOT THE CASE at Diamond's! The lady at the register = super cute, and I kinda like the "stab joint" classic chinese restaurant looks of this place.. no windows! YES! :D Five stars... the food seriously speaks for itself.

My super close, local taco shop. For me, consistency is key, and Filiberto's is always a step above most other restaurants ending with "to's" in that regard.  I'm fairly mental for their Chicken Soft Tacos on corn tortillas. Larger than a typical street taco, they are almost sized more like a mini burrito - Shredded Chicken, a red pepper sauce, lettuce, and melted cheddar = AWESOME. Tuesdays they are only $1, all day!  Finally their Adobada tacos are a bargain at thrice the price. Avoid the Chili Relleno burrito, however. It may be one of the worst things to ever get passed through a drive-thru window.

I live about 3 minutes from Adrian's, and finally gave it a try today! I got a Machaca Burrito, and it was super great!  The place looks like a total dumpster fire from the outside, but inside, while super aged, and worn out, is clean, and cute.  I did try the Horchata, which was nothing special, but the burrito was incredible, and I can't wait to head back, and try other stuff :)

YES YES YES. Burrito Express MAY just have the ABSOLUTE best Breakfast Burritos in THE EAST VALLEY. The Supreme Breakfast Burrito!!! In the words of the prolific Ke$ha: "I'm addicted. It's a crisis!" The mastery of eggs, cheese and meats, doesn't end there, however, and I highly suggest the HOT MACHACA burrito! It will BURN YER MUTHAFKKN FACE OF, YO. Their crispy beef tacos are stellar, and just about everything else I've tried has been, as well. ALSO, they DELIVER... (I don't get stuff delivered.. but they do!) The only disappointment has been.. items containing ground beef.. which is fine, because, eww.. ground beef.. (not a huge fan) D:

How I live 1 block from this gorgeous shrine of booze, and haven't turned into a gutter drunk, is beyond me! It's SOOO wonderful, and their prices are fantastic!!!! For the past several months, cases of Fat Tire (yes.. case.. 24!!! TWENTY FOUR BEERS) COLD are SOLD for $11.99-14.99 (depending on.. ???? I'm not sure.. but still that's sooooooooo LOW!!)  and that's just one little example of the amazingness cuz there's SO MUCH MOAAAARRR amazingness at Sun Devil Liquors!!!   They also have like.. EVERYTHING THAT IS ALCOHOLIC. Sun Devil's makes those korporate HOARS at  bevmo look like an effing Circle K.. :) The staff always knows the answers to any questions, too! Amazing! :D And the basement bar is sooo cool :D And it's probably quite apparrent from my typing that I rolled up in there tonight :D

5 stars, to offset my unduly low 3 star review from last year.. ROLBERTO'S TAKES CREDIT CARDS!!!!!! NO MORE HAVING TO HIT THE ATM FIRST! HOLLER!! ALSO, now that I've fully fallen into the dark world of tacos, Rolberto's has some of the ABSOLUTE BEST Carnitas, and Adobada in the area... Where as most similar places of this type serve an obviously processed, previously frozen iteration of carnitas and adobada, Rolberto's seems far more genuine and homemade. Also, it's very much a family owned/operated type place, and I just love the hell out of it!!! So glad it's so close to my house!

I am a bit of a Barro's freak, and it's tops on my list for diet cheats... I've been going to other locations for years, and realized this one is actually much closer to my house.. While the menu is the same as all others, my experience with take-out pizza and wings last Sunday was a few notches above the other locations.. simply put, the food was prepared much better than other locations I've been to... As a whole, Barro's has RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME Pizza and some of the best wings I've had outside of The Great Lakes region..

Yes. Four stars for this Chinese restaurant that time forgot! Actually 5. yes, FIVE STARS. Why 5 stars? Kwan's serves old school Chinese cuisine that I haven't encountered in years. This isn't the place I'd suggest going for some kind of seafood delight, but if you want Chicken Chow Mein with big huge red ribs, and everything else golden fried in classic deliciousness, THIS is the place to go! When I was just a pup back in Cleveland, this was the type of Chinese food that made every Friday night the best night of the week. Keep in mind that some of the names here are a little different.. For Chow Mein is bean sprouts, water chestnuts, celery, sauce and Chicken over crunchy noodles. My dad has been on the lookout for such Chow Mein since the 90's or something. I'm a big fan of their fried stuff. Their egg foo young has that amazing gravy that inspired me to try my hand at cooking in the first place, way back when I was 9.  Finally, the prices GET STUFFED for less than $10 a person.. more like $7 if you're there for the lunch special. The service is fantastic too. It may look dated, it may smell like your grandma's friend's house but whatever, this is classic Chinese American food at prices that Panda Express can't touch.

a complete insult to italian cuisine. the calamari was fairly decent however only served with some trashy ranch dressing.. and that's where the good ends... The green tea had NO FLAVOR. The ciabatta bread was COLD. not room temp. out of a refrigerator cold! I ordered a special this evening... pasta with breaded shrimp with their specialty "sunrise" sauce (marinara/alfredo mixed together)... The sauce tasted like baby food, and the pasta combined with it tasted like water. The shrimp were a good size but there were only a few, considering the $16.95 price... (also, for this price, soup or salad should be included. not $2.00 more. The shrimp were overcooked and  I bit into one and had to spit it out into my napkin... something I NEVER EVER DO regardless of how something tastes.. It had a foul STRONG fishy taste that was just absolutely nauseating. I alerted the waitress to this and she seemed concerned but offered nothing in compensation. My family members ordered other non-impressive meals.. the vito's italian sausage sandwiches were also cold, and had      slimy boiled peppers in onions.  My dad's Chicken Picatta looked like it was made with frozen-in-a-bag chicken breasts from the grocery store.. again, absolutely insulting considering the menu price. Waitress was unpleasant and visibly angry about something going on with her co-workers.  Completely unprofessional. Let's hope that foul shrimp doesn't come back to haunt me in a few hours!

I haaaate being the guy that gives a 2 star review for something people are crazy about.  I've been actively wanting to try El Pollo Supremo for about 2 months now, and finally got around to it this afternoon, and was quite let down.  First, I was a bit taken aback by the price.. Nearly $12 for a quartered chicken, and nearly $15 (yes.. Fifteen!) for around 12 oz of carne asada (each come with boring beans and some 3rd party tortillas. Also.. salsa that could be jarred by Gerber)..  Once I got home with the goods, and saw the portion sizes, my skepticism grew stronger, and for good reason....  SALTY. Incredibly salty. Toxic saltiness. I'm not a wuss either.. if something has unhealthy levels of anything in it, I'm usually a huge fan. This was not enjoyable. Then came the Carne Asada.. far less salty than the chicken, but still pretty intense... it was OK. I've had worse carne asada.. but I've also had way better. It really needed some good fresh pico de gallo to kinda crisp up the otherwise gummy meat... This is the first time I feel that yelp has steered me wrong... not bad, considering how many WIN places I've found otherwise :) ****Also- looking at the picture of the menu, their combo prices seem to be a MUCH better value than just purchasing full chickens, or full orders of Carne asada!

Great small venue to see a band!!! They really have their shit together, especially for an all ages venue that has a bar... Saw a friend's band, Within The Throes, there on Saturday, and enjoyed the atmosphere and sound system.. I didn't drink when I went, so I'm unsure of how much booze cost, or how the bartenders are, but again, great show, and great venue!!! Looking forward to checking out more stuff here :)

I was excited to give Pei Wei another try after writing it off years ago. I was under the impression that there was a Coke Freestyle machine at *all* Pei Wei's... (not most, lol).. but noo. No such luck. I ordered the Chicken Coconut Curry with brown rice. While I'm not expecting Pei Wei to serve up the most authentic grub, my meal felt haunted by overtones of a Stouffer's TV Dinner, circa 1989. Unacceptable!

I'm sitting here at China King and am baffled at the high rating. The waitress told me they would not honor the Yelp  check-in special.  The restaurant is filthy. There is a film on the windows, and a pair of children's shoes strewn across the waiting area.  The child I think they belong to is actually standing on top of chairs SCREAMING for his mom. This is AWFUL.  There is also a dirty, empty bucket just outside of the front door. I'm not sure why, but eww!! The men's room is SO GROSS, and there's just all sorts of eww everywhere! My best instinct tells me I shouldn't have bothered, but I gave it a whirl, and... The food wasn't *horrible*. The fried rice was really bland. The Egg Drop Soup was kinda barfy. It had nasty peas corn and carrots, and the vegetables had been dehydrated.. they weren't dehydrated very well. My entree was General Tso's Chicken. It was certainly the highlight of the experience, but the chicken itself seemed oddly dense, and of low quality. The prices weren't super great either. I'm guessing all the hype is about the Dim Sum, and the more exotic seafood offerings. I'm still in disbelief that they would not accept the check-in special, filth factor makes me wonder what kind of public health hazard China King is.

FL4VR XPL0D.!!!!1!!!!   I've been to Chino Bandido several times, but it's been close to 3 years since my last trip... The last few times I had been there were rather unremarkable, but Chino got hur groove back it seems. The portions were huge, the flavors were super intense, and the cheese was served by the pound. Having gone with my mom, dad, and neighbors, it seems that junk food loving guys, like myself, prefer Chino Bandido... it's fried, cheesy, gooey, and greasy... which I adore, but that's not for everyone. The Pork Fried Rice could be the best fried rice I've ever had,...  All sorts of yum for less than $10 per person, and it's served with a snickerdoodle after! woooo!

What a fab coffee place!! I love the design and style, the patio is cute and cozy, and OMG, THE COFFEE IS ACTUALLY GOOD. 1 free refill on iced coffee, and I assume regular coffee, equals A WIN!!!  Times NINE.  can't wait to head back to Copper Star.   :)

IKEA makes it easy to maintain a home with some style and dignity on a small budget. The concept is entertaining to say the least.. the layout of the store can get to be a bit stressful.. (DON'T WALK THE WHEEL THE WRONG WAY), but this location in particular is bigger, cleaner,more organized, and less insane than other locations I have been to (Burbank, Carson, Tustin, Pittsburgh). IKEA offers innovative products at a great value.. keep in mind, however, that when you're paying 1.99 for a kitchen gadget, or $19.99 for an office chair, don't expect it to last a lifetime. Finally, the scratch and dent area can be the source of staggering bargains.. Sure it may also contain busted toothbrush holders, and broken mirrors, but they also throw in discontinued items, and floor models, at a substantial discount.

$6.99. Yes that's right folks, the admission to this Buffet is only $6.99, and that INCLUDES beverage!!! While it's certainly not the best buffet I've been to, considering it's $6.99 all day, everyday price, it's pumpin' out sum #SWAG. The selection is fair considering the price, and I've certainly eaten at buffets that cost twice the price, that weren't half as good. There's  not a whole lot of anything that isn't really salty and fried.. This isn't exactly a bad thing either.. by salty, I just mean high sodium content.. the flavor is decent.. There are plenty of the usual fried chicken whatever glopped in sugary sauce, along with pot stickers, soups, crab puffs, ribs, and much more.  The fried items are the star at this buffet, and the foods are fresh.. The sushi is well.. I just skip the sushi here, but for $6.99 (INCLUDING DRINK!) you would be hard pressed to feed yourself at McDonald's for the same price.  Service is friendly, dining area is huge, and clean. OH AND THEY HAVE DIET MOUNTAIN DEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Which is great. Because I'm completely CRAZY for Diet Mountain Dew. :D

I've dined at Pita Jungle several times, and it seems as if they can do no wrong.  It had been quite a while since my last visit, and I've become far more diet conscious, which made my most recent visit an absolute delight.  Back in my carb whore days, I used to always order Pasta, which were always impressive, but on my recent visit, I went for the Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips.  INCREDIBLE.  I am fairly sure this was one of the best prepared examples of fish to ever cross my lips.  Flavor and texture were exquisite.  It was served over a ridiculously flavorful cilantro-jalepeno hummos, along with some pea sprouts, and pita chips on the side.  The presentation was also quite nice for such a moderately priced, casual restaurant, too. I guess my only slight annoyance was that the fish is served on TOP of the hummus.. since it's such a tender, flaky fillet, it did have the tendency to get lost in the hummus. A very minor, detail. The whole thing was absolutely delicious, the iced tea was delicious, server was *fantastic*, and I had an extremely enjoyable meal with my dining partner.

so gross.  I was expecting something on par with Pacific Seafood buffet, as it is priced the same, and has similar praise on yelp..  SO GROSS.  They have a dude standing around playing with sushi, making it seem fresh, when in fact it's pre-sliced, in plastic tubs, and has been sitting around since...????  I'm doing a low-carb diet, and was expecting a wide array of edible seafood, and other meats, but there really wasn't much to choose from, which meant that I ate.. carbs.. which happens sometimes.. no big deal. BUT WTF even their fried carby things were really terrible. The crab legs were cold, and tasted like a wet bathing suit that had been balled up in a bag for 3 days. Everything sucked.  Boo, Crazy Buffet. Boo. ALSO. desserts next to raw oysters? that just struck me as odd...

After a 12 hour fast for blood work, I screeched minivan tires and headed up Central for a full tilt lunchtime pig out! For less than 10 dollars I stuffed my face with one of the best cheeseburgers and fries the city has to offer. If you like burgers, and let's face it, you're weird if you don't, Lenny's is a must stop shop!

I live about 2 blocks from here, which means..... I end up here about 3 times a week. It's the Fry's that time forgot... I try to make the best of the situation by trying to pretend I'm having some kind of retro experience, but the novelty of that is wearing off.  The selection is terrible, and they often run out of staples, like ohh. Half and Half.. or chicken. Completely.. out.. of chicken! LOL. How does that even happen? The staff members are all reaaaaaaally friendly though, and very helpful. Oh and the fried chicken isn't too terrible.. as far as grocery store fried chicken goes. :)

It seems like not so long ago, The Fatburger brand was blowing up, and expansion seemed endless... 10 years later, and Fatburger almost seems like a relic of the past, and isn't the first place people think of when it's.. BURGERTIME. Thanks to a few fantastic Groupons, I've returned to Fatburger, a few times recently. Really impressed! I admit to being a glutton, and enjoying *EVERYTHING* in excess, so The XXL Burger, Chili Cheese Fries, and Lemonade totez hit the spot.. GIANT TASTY MEAL... Even without a Groupon, the price isn't too horrible, and with one, it's an absolute steal! The staff is fab, and friendly, and while the interior decor is modern retro, it's.. now.. really outdated modern retro, and needs to be remodern retrofied. :)  Give Fatburger another whirl! I'm glad I did.

So much has changed since new ownership.... The staff is friendly, efficient, and plentiful.. I'm basing my review on two trips over the last year for a special event known as Bearracuda... which has been a spectacular big mess of fun each time I've attended. The owner of The Rock seems like an extra cool dude, and I applaud him for his improvements to the bar. Also booze = dirt cheap. Woot.

Classic Gyro joint food! Can't go wrong with the Original Gyro, with a Greek Salad.. being the mega carnivore I am, I opt for extra meat! :) Order some extra tzatziki sauce if you're a fan of it.. I tend to enjoy my gyros swimming in it.  Also, the building itself is a great example of classic Mid-century "Googie" Architecture. Glad to have such a cool little spot a block away.

Compared to Aloha Kitchen, this place just doesn't stack up. The meats are much saltier, and seem very processed, in comparison. The Kalua Pork lacks depth.. it tastes like it was soaked in liquid smoke, and salt for a few days... and the Katsu chicken is of school cafeteria quality. It's not the worst food I've ever eaten, but doesn't compare to the home-made feel of Aloha Kitchen, or other non-chain Hawaiian places I've eaten at in So.Cal.

I  love the pharmacy staff at this location. They've been incredibly helpful, friendly, and accommodating- I have HIV and not just any pharmacy can properly handle dispensing the medication I require. The Pharmacists have been very helpful in regards to changes with my insurance coverage, as well as providing information regarding the drugs I do take. They've never let me down, and I am 100% satisfied with this location in particular. Also, the new Walgreens app for smart phone is extra super awesome, and makes life SOO easy. Woo.

!!!!!!!!!! The best asian food I have had in the valley, by far. Each and every noodle dish that I have tried has been STELLAR (Beef Chow Fun, Singapore Noodles, Shrimp LoMein) as well as the Hawaiian Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Spicy Chicken, and probably a few more that I am forgetting! The only thing that could possibly improve are the chairs, but with food this good, I'd sit on cinderblocks, and LIKE it. :D Even the iced tea is fabulous! The staff members are very very nice too! This is a must try!

I was very excited to have a lunchy brunch at St. Francis this past Saturday. I was impressed by the environment and decor, but once I was served a rather average $9 Bloody Mary, the experience began to degrade.  I ordered the highly hyped Chile Burger. It's touted to be the best burger in the state. I beg to differ. It wasn't terrible, however it just wasn't all that exquisite.. The beef was kinda squishy and flavorless, and the spicy factor overpowered the flavors. This may just be a problem with my gut, but I began feeling kinda sick as I was eating it, and then spent the entire rest of the day experiencing horrific gut trauma. That's not why I'm giving St. Francis a 1 star review, though. The reason for the 1 star review is because my boyfriend and I experienced a bad case of waitress neglect. She probably spent a total of 2 minutes at our table. When the check arrived we were ready to pay immediately, and after waiting over 15 minutes, we took the check downstairs, and had to pay that way. She chirped out some sort of insincere apology, and I gave her a dirty look. The restaurant wasn't super busy, and we were the only party left upstairs at that point. This is inexcusable.

I'm a value sorta guy...considering that, I should HATE this place on paper, but the quality, selection of items you won't find other places, and general vibe of the store are fantastic.  You will pay top dollar, but you get top notch stuff in return! Their baked goods are exquisite, their meats are the most gorgeous chunks of dead flesh you'll ever see, and then.. there's the Beer & Wine. Wow.

These tamales are DAMB GOOD. It seems that the operators of Old El Paso Tamales are fully aware of that... The Tamales are, again.. delicious, and perfect in consistency, flavor, texture, temperature, and freshness, BUT.. they're about 1/2 the size of a standard Tamale and a little bit more expensive.. The place doesn't have a menu board.. it's just.. tamales! (i guess they make other things but.. I'm not sure they want you to know that. :) The Chicken was my favorite, but also the pork and beef are FAB.

yet another groupon try...  They have a HUGE menu, which excited me greatly, upon first gaze, however the results weren't so great. I had the Mama Leone. The bread was kinda gummy, the meats were ok, but there sure wasn't much to this sandwich.. it was supposed to be hot, but it was just lukewarm, and the marinara sauce was also cold. Yuck.  Also, the Little Italy Salad was served not-as-described by the menu (they didn't include croutons, or onions.. it was just lettuce, tomatoes, and meat. that's it!).  Finally, the dining area is cluttered, and needs to be de-crumbed.

I typically despise buffets of any sort, but this one is certainly an exception. I've eaten here several times over the past 3 years, and it's always good, and it just seems to keep getting better.. Today was stellar! The sushi and sashimi are always very well prepared, served nice, and cold, and are very fresh. I am have a compromised immune system, and do not fear any of their seafood offerings, right down to raw oysters! Their regular asian dishes are done well too, but my advice, is skip the noodles, and the sweet and sour chicken, and load up on the great seafood delights offered here.  Also, their staff is always on top of things, no matter how busy things get..

It's been over 2 years since my last review of Pacific Seafood Buffet. I've been eating here regularly since 2006, and I've yet to have a bad experience, get sick, or.. find a consistently better Asian Buffet. That's huge, as I've visited what feels like.. ALL THE BUFFETS in the East Valley. The sushi is always fresh, super tasty, and totally scarfable. The hot dishes are really good too.. everything is a notch above what most other buffets sling. They serve up an amazing Szechuan Fish.. I kinda ate 1/2 a pan of it the last time I was there... or maybe more than 1/2 a pan, and I'm actually quite proud of myself!  Top it off with a fun selection of decent desserts (especially the Strawberry Whipped Cream cake, and those fun little square Mocha cakes) and you've got a buffet I'm eager to hit at any time!

I've decided I will not let any other place touch my hair. Manny's is amazing. I always get a KILLER awesome haircut, and the price is reasonable too. The location has changed since this entry was made... Manny's has moved to a much bigger, nicer location at: 811 W. University Dr. 101 Mesa, 85201. Phone number is still the same - (480) 464-4403  Manny and Blanca do GREAT work, along with the rest of the staff!

I used to have this sort "ugh, mexican food for snowbird tourists" attitude towards Mango's. I live and work right in downtown Mesa, and have eaten there maybe twice over the last 9 years... it wasn't until recently that suddenly the joy and amazingness of Mango's really showed itself to me. The environment is almost tropical, and very pleasant.. lots of color, and vibe. Great music. The food is pretty great. Their pollo asado is just killer, and they certainly serve one of the most hearty, tasty quesadillas I've ever experienced. Their chimichangas, and just about everything else are also fantastic. I'm looking at lovely Mango's outside of my office window as I type this, and I'm tempted to run over and stuff my face with like.. 20 dollars worth of food, but I don't want to rupture my gut on Christmas Eve. It's a true institution in Mesa, an area that truly deserves more love than the rest of the valley gives it. Come on down, and check it out!

I've been coming here frequently for years, and was in a total rut.. I was always ordering one of the big gigantic rice bowls, with tasty, high quality meats, and veggies. They are good! A great, healthy meal, and a great value. But TODAY.. was a day for fish eatin'. The Volcano Blackened Mahi Mahi is my new everything.  I chose Rumbi Rice, which is a coconut infused rice with a few beans. Yummy yummy stuff. Super yummy. The mahi itself was perfectly cooked, and spiced.. the fillet was also cooked nicely, tasted awesome, and was husky, in size. Very husky. I'm a hungry guy! Topped with some sort of pretty sauce..(mango passion aioli I have learned!) and a tropical fruit salsa, this is a very festive meal! On the side? A small but nicely dressed ceasar salad.. I am also a GIGANTIC fan of their Chicken Tortilla soup... it too is delicious, and coconut infused!  Rumbi has great prices, to boot! Amazing iced tea! Awesome staff! and some sort of buy 5 get one free kinda stamp card! Also, the patio is quite lovely! Yay, Rumbi!

Volcano Blackened Mahi! As said in my earlier review, i'm CRAZY for the Mahi. Four stars, went to 5 today, when I realized I could order the entrée with steamed vegetables, instead of Rumbi rice.  The Rumbi rice is AMAZING, don't get me wrong, but HOLY CARBS. I believe I could live off of this for the rest of my life, and be a very happy man! :)

Judging by the reviews below, I'm guessing my negative experience was isolated. I stopped in for a single cup of regular brew coffee.. The credit card machine was acting up, and I see that I was charged 3 times on my bank statement. Those things happen, I realize, but what really sours the situation is the coffee itself - I've honestly had better from Folger's... once again, I realize that most places in the area seem to concentrate on making tasty lattes, and mochas, but I'm not a fluffy drink kind of guy. Their dark roast is forgettable, at best, and very weak. boo.

It's convenient for me, as it's close to my home, but with prices sometimes being 20% higher than Total, it's typically a better idea for me to head over to Total, and stock up.

We also order sandwiches for our events. It's also becoming my new happy hour haunt, as their prices are AMAZING! I love the new location, the staff is brilliant, and I'm so heading over for two slices after I finish writing this review.  Highlights include garlic cheese bread, Queen o' Hearts sandwich, and any freshly made pizza.. or the great 2 slice special for $5.99 (lunch).  Craft beer, wells, and domestics at happy hour are just $3!  So are select appetizers. Yay for Queen's! Queen's, pls! :D

Well organized, affordable, easy to navigate, great entertainment, and a multitude of fun activities. There was an impressive amount of diversity, when it came to entertainment - a tent with lesbian folk singers, the main stage which included TIFFANY... OMG OMG TIFFANY, 2 big huge dance tents with some impressive DJ's, and much more.  While the festival has all the features of a big city pride festival, it also had a bit of an intimate, smaller city feel.  The beer prices were surprisingly awesome! $5 per drink, with a variety to choose from, including Widmer, and Landshark! Woo!

Haircut changes everything. No, seriously. The whole Samson  theory is hella true, but in the opposite way with me. I just can't face life bravely unless I'm properly trimmed. I recently started my first full time gig in 9 years and the first thing I did after getting news of the hire was go to Electric Haven. I knew upon beer offering that I had hit the right place, and began bragging about how awesome this barber shop is on facebook. Then came the fucking haircut. OMFG. I'm pretty sure the barber that's super rad is named Timmy.? He's this skinny Irish dude with a lot of tattoos. That dude is a fucking haircutting ninja. Again, involved in this process is beer. Kilt Lifter. They aren't fucking around. I have a beard. I'm a bear. It brings the man bitches. This dude makes my beard look bear social media megastar hot. This beard also finally scores me boys that are bear social media megastar hot.  I think I've made my point clear. Best grooming experience ever.

In our society of digital narcissism, attractiveness is measured by Facebook likes, right? Cuz omg, I'm hot like young Elvis, if that's the case.

not too great. small entree portions with like.. 5 lbs of really boring rice to make up for skimping on the entrees, which were quite bland as it was (Lamb Shank, Mousaka)... Spanokipita was served kinda cold and was obviously processed/frozen. Good pita!!! Baba Ganouj was really gross. Much better food at Haji Baba in Tempe, and the prices at Omega are rather high.

This review is based solely on salads, carry-out. I eat salads. Lots of salads. Lots of really dull, average, sad salads. Thanks to the countless reviews for both locations, it seemed quite clear that this was the place to go to get some.. exciting salads. EXCITEMENT is what's packed into the salads here! I had the Chicken Tikka salad, which is two hefty, hot chicken breasts and the standard fair of lettuce, onions, etc.. Fresh! Crispy! Tasty! The folks both had the Sausage Salads which were even more incredible.. they pack like.. a pound of really tasty homemade sage sausage, with a really incredible creamy mustard dressing, all under $9 each! What a score!!! I can't wait to go back to Cornish Pasty!

ohhhhh what a pleasant, delicious, surprise this buffet was. :D Friday dinner = 14.50 per person, including soft drink, and the food is glorrrrioussss. GLORIOUS. I ate like.. 8 lbs of smoked salmon, orange roughy, marinated Mediterranean seafood salads, a few fancy raviolis, and grazed on really tasty salad, antipasti, cheeses, ceviche, AND ALL SORTS of other really delicious delicacies. YAAY. SUPER CLEAN. very well staffed, with attentive service. Cloth napkins! FANTSY. THIS is a luxury buffet, for the same price, or just a few bucks more than what one would typically pay a gross chain buffet, infested with big, scary, giant human mutant things. I cannot wait to return :D The freshness/quality quotient is super high, and the value is stellar.

I just reviewed Kwan's Sampan, and also just gave it 5 stars, but these places are quite different than each other. Experience fresh, crispy, tasty modern Asian fare at mall food court prices. This is a much more modern take on Chinese/Asian food. If you don't like your food fried, battered, and swimming in a sea of Sweet & Sour sauce, or gravy, then you've hit the jackpot with Dragon Express.

I'm so glad to live in an area with stores like this, and even more thrilled to have Pro's Ranch Market in Mesa!  Their bakery is out of this world, their food is very good (tacos tacos tacos!!!!!), they have EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN, and MORE, and their prices on meat and produce are also rather spectacular. The quality is also tough to beat! Freshly roasted hatch chiles always seem to be available! Did I mention the amazing Aguas Frescas stand, with some of the creamiest, tastiest Horchata in the 480? :D

Very lucky to have this gem near my home. RIDICULOUSLY LOW PRICES on fruits and vegetables.... have been shopping here since the beginning, and kinda stopped because it was getting.. dirty, and the produce was a bit...funky... a few months of shopping at Fry's for such things, and I got fed up... returned to Mekong Supermarket, this evening to do some serious shopping, and was thrilled to see that they have been doing a great job of keeping the store clean again. Also, the vegetables were BEAUTIFUL.... seemingly WEEKS fresher than what the major grocery chains are trying to push for at least triple the price... Of course, there's so much more to this store than just fruits and veggies... I took a gaze at the meats today, but didn't really stumble on any great deals, but at that point I was quite tired, lol... Fab selection of just about everything you could imagine from the Asian continent.. some nice beer/wine choices too..

Was extremely psyched to try Lobby's, considering all of the great reviews, but I was sadly disappointed with the results. I'm a freak for Chili burgers (good ones are very difficult to find) and The Lobby's Chili burger was fairly dull, featured Cinci style Chili (BLAH) and like. some sort of cheese whiz kinda crap.  Boo. Also ordered fries, and a Chicago dog.. the Chicago dog was overpriced and forgettable, and the crinkle cut fries were reminiscent of Del Taco's.. which isn't exactly a bad thing, but considering that Lobby's is supposed to be a tasty, quality burger place, frozen crinkle fries are kind of a half assed approach.. ALSO the amount of salt on the fries was enough to invoke a stroke! :x  Finally whoever dude was that handed me my bag of food was all like ZIPPY DOO I GAVE YOU A CUP OF FRENCH FRY SAUCE.. There were two orders of fries.. one cup of sauce.. which was just basic secret sauce.. not super great... secret sauce, to boot.. Thanks bro, but I don't need any secret sauce favors.

Jumped on the groupon offered last week for My Arepa.  I had very high hopes.  Tried the Grilled Meat Medley ($14). There was this gristly carne asada thing in there, along with a small link of chorizo, and a blood sausage. None of these sausages were sufficient in size, and neither was the wad of hyde they tried to pass off as "steak". There was also a few lumps of fried yucca. Those were alright.  Also ordered a few Arepas ($4-6 each).  They were the size of a McDonald's cheeseburger.. the corn bread the meat sat on was OMG SO DRY AND STALE, and the filling inside (meat + gouda) was greasy, bland, and gloppy. This is some really overpriced, sad food. No me gusta!

I've attended several "Adult Educations" at Fort McDowell Adventures.  This place knows how to throw a party. A crazy, amazing hang from the ceiling fans sorta party.  The staff is genuinely thrilled to host an event, and do a great job of making guests feel welcome on a personal level. The grounds are gorgeous, and so are the event spaces, along with fun things like a RUM BUS and a TEQUILA BUS! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I'm looking forward to taking a the Jeep tour, or something similar when things warm up a bit. Fort McDowell Adventures is truly one of the gems of The Valley of The Sun, and I always look forward to the next adventure!

Yogi's is my cheap/quick low carb paradise!  Their low carb teriyaki bowls are kick ass!! A gigantic serving of tasty, lean meats over a bed of steamed cabbage, carrots, broccoli, and zucchini! Woo! If rice is your thing, you can get some nice sticky white rice, or well prepared brown rice, too!   Another thing I love at Yogi's is the Arizona Bowl. It's basically like a big bowl of California roll fixins!!! Their Sushi is quite good too!! Their California roll is always fantastic, and they put the SPICY back in Spicy Tuna. I've been a Yogi's fan for years, and the food has always been consistently well prepared, and extremely fresh.  The only thing I've not been too thrilled with at Yogi's is the Spicy Teriyaki.... not so good, Al.. not so good...  ALSO. Closed on Sundays.. for genuflections, or something.

WOW. A few days back, tried Lenny's for the first time, and was not impressed.. I was contacted by the owner, and he graciously offered to correct the situation. Instant awesome. I was an oscillating combo of skeptical and optimistic about my next experience at Lobby's, and I'm SO GLAD to say that my experience today was FANTASTIC. Figured I'd  bring home a few different items from the menu including : Triple Cheeseburger.. SO FANTASTIC. SO CHEESY. SO MEATY. SO TASTY. LOVED IT. GIGANTIC. HUGE. BurgerPerfekt!!! Also grabbed a few different hot dogs, and a Mexican Burger. Those were great too. The next real gold star winner are the ONION RINGS. These are serious. Huge portion, cooked perfectly, and absolutely wonderful.. batter dipped too (i detest breaded onion rings..)  I'm sooooo glad that I gave Lenny's a second try because I now rank them VERY high on my list of local burger places. WOO!

HOW? HOW. CAN. FOOD. TASTE SO GOOD? AT A BUFFET! OH MY GOD.  I've never been to a better buffet. Went for birthday dinner, tonight.. $20.00 cover charge includes beverage.. had a soda to begin with, and ended with coffee! No additional fee.  Two kinds of smoked salmon, caprese salad, GIGANTIC cocktail shrimp, REALLY FANCY FRENCH CHEESES and a whole host of other nibbly delicacies are the first things to the right, when you walk into this glutton's paradise. FINALLY. I HAVE EATEN OYSTERS ON THE HALFSHELL THAT I LOVE. SO LOVE. SO FRESH. I've only had icky oysters prior to this. :( I'm a new man!   The quality is absolutely top-notch, along with the freshness.  I didn't use up too much stomach space on at the Mexican part of the buffet, but the Mojito Cod (Or some sorta tropically treated cod) was really delicious! Along with this, the traditional BIG CHUNKS OF MEAT UNDER A RED LIGHT ON A BUTCHER BLOCK that every buffet seems to have were present, and unfortunately sliced incorrectly.. a quick mention to the waitress rectified the issue however.. these meats (Beef, and pork) were surely well prepared, though, and tasty.  Living right next door to the GIANT MEATS were an assortment of fried seafood (shrimp, calamari, and scallops) which perfect too.  Not to be forgotten, are the salad bar, and Asian section.. the Asian section featured the typical fried appetizers (Crab Rangoon, Eggrolls, etc) and a few entrees.. The General Tso's chicken was KICK ASS.. the noodles were an oversight because I was focused on fancy! The entire north wall of the buffet is dedicated to Italian delights.. Pizzas, and Pastas.. Normally I skip pizzas completely at buffets, but WHOLE WHEAT WOOD FIRED PIZZAS, HAND MADE!!! and REALLY GREAT! Also, creamy stuffed ravioli were a highlight...  Now, for the desserts.. There must have been 7,000 desserts available for the taking, along with a HUGE assortment of delicious gelatos.  The sparkling gem of the entire dessert experience, however was the FRESH MADE BANANAS FOSTER, SERVED ON VANILLA BEAN GELATO. Yeah, you heard me folks.. walk on up, ask for Bananas foster, and it's prepared right in front of you, butter, sugar, bananas, cream, Meyer's Dark Rum, and Bananas.. AMAZING. Absolutely AMAZING.  There's SOOO much more to this buffet than what's mentioned, but combined with the delightful dining area, and STUNNING mountain view, I actually almost cried leaving, like a kid being dragged out of Disneyland at closing time...... (FLAWLESS STAFF/SERVICE TOO, BTW!)

Do you like food comas?  Do you believe that there's a buffet on this planet where EACH AND EVERY ITEM is perfect, delicious, and has the same quality and amazement as an entree you'd order off of a menu? If you believe, then you're in for a treat - India Oven is truly that place; the very first buffet I've ever been to in which none of the food served tasted like... it was from a buffet. Everything is awesome. The service is impeccable, and they constantly throw the best garlic naan on earth at you. This is why I'm fat, and I'm so proud to be!

Just like Danielle's review below, do not let looks turn you away. The food here is phenomenal!  I was a bit confused at first by the menu of American, and Mexican food, on top of Thai... We too wanted the buffet, but it was a bit late (Technically it's a lunch buffet from what I get), and were treated to ordering off the menu, and Joann,  the owner, brought along a whole host of other goodies to go with our food, for us to try. My Green Coconut Curry Chicken was presented beautifully, and unlike most  Green Curry Chicken I've had in the area, the sauce was creamy, instead of soupy, and had a fabulous green chile flavor to it.... delightfully spicy, with flavor to back it up.  My dad ordered the Thai Basil Chicken which was also spectacular, bursting with flavor. My mom ordered the Pad Thai, which far surpassed any other Pad Thai I have tried too. I've eaten at plenty of Thai places, coast to coast, and the food here is at least on par, and may just surpass the best that Hollywood's Thai Town has to offer.  The meal was ended with dreamy Coconut Ice Cream, with finely ground peanut on top, along with Palm Seed!!! Everything here tastes genuine, and homemade. The prices are very good too, and the Thai Iced tea is also great. The Owner/cook brings much experience to the table, having cooked for Pink Pepper, and a host of other well known eateries, in the past.  I CANNOT WAIT to go back VERY soon, and try some other stuff! SO SO GOOD!!!

I'm noticing a theme with my yelp reviews.. I'm in love with places that look sketchy externally. That's really cool these days, right? Anyhow, OMG what an adventure Posidon is!!! Since they serve breakfast, there WILL be a morning after, and I'm in danger of becoming fatter than Shelley Winters, as Posidon is located just 3 minutes from my home.  ABOUT THE FOOD: Ordered 3 take-out meals for 3 people: The entree choices are extensive, include your choice of soup, or greek salad, and for a side, rice (a bit bland) , fries (didn't try) , or roasted potatoes (GREAT + AWESOME. YUM) . The Greek Salads are huge, packed with delicious greek olives, feta, and all the veggies were super crisp and super fresh. One of the best side salads I've ever had. For the entrees, Gyro Plate, Lamb Soulvaki, and Moussaka, were ordered. My Moussaka was KICK ASS and completely put that swill from My Big Fat Greek to shame. The Lamb Soulvaki was juicy, and tender, and dad seemed to enjoy his giant plate of Gyro meat. All of these are served with fresh grilled pita wedges too, and rang in just below $10 each. SO MUCH FOOD, for the price. Finally the two staff members I encountered were SO NICE, helpful, cheerful, and very willing to accommodate customers. Place is clean, and I can't wait to rip into other menu items.. I am already looking forward to trying their full sized salads ASAP! Finally they have an assortment of fresh made Baklava! Check this place out!

not too thrilled. food is overpriced, the portions are mediocre, and while the ingredients are of decent quality, the result is very dull, and bland. Tried the Al Pastor Vampiro (this little... tostada thing), and the Carne Asada Burrito.. (though it was more like a taquito, in size), and refried beans. Beans were decent.. soupy though.

Ohhhh YESS. REALLY RAD... Cuz omg I can get.. THE ARIZONA BURGER which is the perfect level of SPICY YUM, a CHILI dog that's actually REALLY GOOD TOO (hard to come by) and if I want to go full hog, AWESOME FRIES. The staff and service are stellar, and the food is just wowww. The choice of buns, burgers, sizes etc is all really great, and the freshness factor is second to none. Great for a chain. Woo!

Yeah, OK Food City, as a store, pales in comparison to Ranch Market. I'm putting this review up, for one simple redemption.  Pollo Asado.  I've tried it from pretty much every outlet in the East Valley, including El Pollo Supremo, but the Pollo Asado from the parking lot grill at this Food City location is chicken NIRVANA. It's marinated in Orange juice, and spices, and is always hot, juicy, and fresh. Not overly salty, never dried out, or funky, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO, for Pollo Asado, in Mesa!  Also, their bakery is pretty good, not nearly as grand as Ranch Market's but Food City does have pretty amazing donuts :)

I was shocked to learn that Mesa had a gay bar, and was even more shocked to see HOW nice this place is. SERIOUSLY STYLISH. Great lighting and sound system.  Attractive, professional bartenders, and RIDICULOUSLY low drink prices, even on weekends!!! I'll admit that the crowd is very mainstream gay, which isn't exactly my thing, but the location is quite convenient for me, and is at the end of the light rail, so it's a great spot if you want to get wrecked on half price drinks, and not have to drive!  I'm eager to try their vittles, based on my impressive experience this past Saturday.

A friend I grew up with, back east, now lives in Vegas, and urged me to check out Capriotti's, when she saw they opened in Mesa. Glad I did! I enjoyed the Grilled Italian sandwich, and was pretty much blown away by the incredible amounts of delicious, Italian meats that were used, on this huge sandwich, bursting with flavor. One of my dining companions ordered the Chopped Italian Salad.. the meats olives, and chick peas were a nice touch, but the lettuce was kinda meh looking, and they don't offer much in the way of choices, for salad dressings.  I would absolutely stick with the sandwiches.... Great meat, great cheese, great bread, great peppers.. a great east coast sandwich, and I can't wait to try more stuff here!

Tried several varieties of their meats tonight, in different iterations, and was quite pleased.  It's kinda like filiberto's/chipotle hybrid, but with a much more home made taste!  Standard taco, burrito, quesadilla type fair, but they some reaaaaally amazing looking breakfast items that I'm looking forward to trying, including Migas, Chilaquiles, and breakfast tortas!!  The owners are super cool, and the place has a bit of style. Super thrilled that it's so close to home :)

OMG I LOVE YOU JIMMY JOHNS. YOUR SUBS ARE SO MEATY. and fairly priced. The guys that work at Jimmy John's are pretty cute, to boot. They are SO FAST, too! The Gargantuan is my absolute favorite! It's gigantic! I've had it with, and without bacon, and I gotta say, it's better without the bacon.  Bread is always fresh, flavorful, and perfectly baked.

Great CarWash! For $3 (YES THREE DOLLARS) you get fully sudsy automated wash, with clean fresh water. I used to live in Cleveland, and for $10, you got mud water, and a few soap bubbles.. that's it. PLUS AT QUICK N CLEAN... FREE VACUUMS. Yes. You heard me. FREE VACUUMS. Reason #250738538 Living in Phoenix rules! Car Washes like Quick N Clean!

BOOOOOOOOO. Sure the prices were great, but ughh.  Ordered Double Jalepeno Burger ($5.50).. Two very thick patties. Previously frozen. Grey. Springy. REALLY SALTY.  The Jalepenos were canned and bland. No cheesiness to the burger either.. the thousand island, and everything else was good. It wasn't a horrible burger, but, it begins the previously frozen theme of the meal. Also ordered 12 Hot Wings ($6.50) to split. HORRIBLE. Overcooked. The sauce was extremely sour.. white vinegar mixed with chili pepper maybe? Not all that hot, just pasty, unpleasant, and gross. Also ordered a box-of-fries ($6.00) to split. Generous portion, but there seemed to be 2lbs of salt. The fries were also obviously frozen, and were school cafeteria crinkle cut. I'm pretty sure I'm going to be known as "The Burger Bitch" on yelp, cuz i'm quite critical of burger joints, lol!

I loved my visit to Two Hippies Beach House!! I had the Greek Hot Dog with feta, bacon, olives, and pesto mayo, and a Carne Asada taco. The Hot Dog ($4) is a meal in itself, and is served on an amazingly awesome fresh roll... toasted, and buttered... NOMZ. The taco was HUGE for $2, and there's just no such thing as skimping at Two Hippies. The staff is SO welcoming, and friendly, and seem to be very enthused to be there. I love the environment of this little place too!! My only complaint it was HOT in there. Really.. really.. hot. I realize that sometimes new places have issues getting up & running fully, and that maybe the A/C wasn't fully functioning when I was there.  I would also suggest some lower carb items: everything is CARBORIFIC!! :)  Finally, if you like Chipotle, eat here once, and you'll probably never return to stupid Chipotle... :)  ALSO: Received msg from establishment letting me know that they accommodate low carb requests! YES!! :D

I LOVE Haven Burger! It's very close to my home and office and I always have an amazing experience! Few restaurants offer this amount of "bang for the buck"... For a few bucks *less* than what it costs to eat a combo meal at Jack in The Box or McDonald's you're in for a legit, beefy, burger with a flavor explosion factor not available at places with drive-thru windows. Add that to a really friendly staff, cheery environment, and a unique, varied menu of american burger favorites, and awesome Mexican comfort foods, and you just can't go wrong! I suggest a double pastrami burger with cheese. *drools*

ZING. ZAM. ZOWIE. WOW. This is a GREAT new spot, with dangerously fantastic burgers, salads, and other assorted sandwiches at crazy-low prices! I had the Double CharBurger with Cheese ($4.50) which is quite similar to an In-N-Out double double, but flame grilled and a bit more substantial.. which equates to PERFECT, when it comes to my ideal burger. Also had a Ceasar Side Salad ($3.95) which well... was just that... nothing special, but fresh, and served the purpose. Co-diners were very happy with their salads/burgers as well.  Fries are very good, if not a bit on the average side. Staff is hellbent on making sure you're happy, and the experience is much calmer and enjoyable than Five Guys (similar concept).  Also, major points for having such a relaxing, expansive, enjoyable patio.

So cool! Great space! Super stylish! Guy who slings the brew really seems passionate about his craft. I'm serious about my Iced Americanos, and Lo-Fi did *not* disappoint!  My only gripe is that they do not have decaf, however the owner did have a good reason.. he just can't seem to find decaf worth serving.. I'm really glad to have something this cool and stylin' in Downtown Mesa... worth a trip just to check it out! :3

ERMAHGERD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This INCREDIBLE source of Mexican has been right under my nose for years, and I just tried it for the first time last week! So far the Carnitas are the best in the 480 - at least. I can't not order the Steak, egg, sausage, and cheese burrito also... yes, you heard me.. not just steak egg and cheese.. it's.... ALSO GOT SAUSAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not greasy! High quality meats! I'll probably be having my 3rd meal this week from Taquitos Jalisco super soon, and I'll try a few more items. This destroys all other "to's" places. Wow, just WOW!

Flame Burger? More like Lame Burger. This restaurant operates in what was an abandoned El Pollo Loco, and not much effort to clean up the dirt left behind has been made.. The sidewalks are filthy, and for as new as this restaurant is, the dining room isn't much better. I tried the Chili Burger and an All Beef Hot Dog. The burger patty was dry, and kinda crunchy, not very substantial. The chili was made of.. ???? and basically tasted like salt water. The hot dog ($2.29) was not very substantial, but was of decent quality, and tasted alright. The iced was very far from fresh, and a switch to Diet Coke wasn't much better.. very watery. The staff was friendly, but they don't really seem to have it together.

I was super impressed with the green chile burger! Packed with flavor, and meaty green chile, it's a hearty, tasty burger! I also had a GIANT sonoran style hot dog, which may not have been as awesome as the type one would get from a street cart, but really impressive just the same. The staff is friendly, and the menu offers quite a variety!  The meats for many items are wood smoked! Yay!  What I did find so bueno about Bueno burger was the dining situation-  the dining room itself is clean and sufficient, with a giant TV, but the smoke from the kitchen is rather stifling. The outdoor eating area is huge, but picnic table style, made of industrial steel.... really... uncomfortable industrial steel. Food is king, however, when it comes to my opinion of a place, so 4 stars, for Bueno Burger!

Salty. Greasy. Gross. Cold. Meats are not cooked to order.. they're kept hot like a buffet.. a not very good buffet. Ordered a whole bunch of different items to share, and it all pretty much sucked. The Shrimp tacos would have been really awesome had they not had like.. 9919191829291019292919229mgs of sodium.  You're better off at any of the "to's"

It had been a while since I had a seat at a real barber shop, let alone the time to get my hair cut anywhere but great clips. I was frustrated, and overgrown. My once amazing beard was a disaster, and I wasn't feeling very pretty.  Yelp led me to this amazing shop, located in a groovy spot of Central Phoenix. Inside, one of the most vibrant, friendly barbers I've met welcomed me warmly, and pointed out soft drinks and pop corn available for free! The waiting area is appointed with really luxo seats. Every inch of the shop has something really fascinating to look at, and if that's not enough, a rockin' home theater system with dvd's galore is available to make the wait great.  As for the haircut, this is probably the best I've looked in all of 2014. Matt did a great job shaving my head, and added a great element of style to my once again amazing beard!!!!

Their Mushroom pizzas use FRESH MUSHROOMS.  no slimy canned fungus!  woot!

"No. I don't want 5 guys. 5 guys are the guys who can't get no love from me. Servin' up some ok fries, but the price sky high.. ya won't hear no hollerin' from me!"  Between the sloppy staff, the hard to swallow prices, and the OMITTANCE OF CHEESE, which made my bacon burger even HARDER to swallow, this Five Guys location gets a whopping 2 stars. That being said, I think I would have been happier with a Whopper. The only redemption to this meal, which was had on really ugly tables, and super uncomfortable seats, was the glut of french fries. I allegedly had a hot dog too, but it was obviously quite forgettable, because the only detail I really remember from the hot dog was explaining to the broad who took my order that "everything on a hot dog *doesn't mean lettuce..."  I'll go satisfy my appetite with something spectacular....... elsewhere.

I grabbed dinner and some brews at Daily Dose Midtown with my friend last night. Great food, great beers, great prices! The burger was exquisite, and with the happy hour prices going 4-9 daily, my adoration for places like Smashburger is in peril. I'm looking forward to future meals at Daily Dose, and plan on returning super soon!

The atmosphere at Handlebar is absolutely fantastic. The patio is magazine-ad perfect.. you seriously feel like you're in a hip urban environment, doing hip, urban things... and in hip, urban style!  The beer selection is vast.. I don't drink, but I find the beer menu impressive. The food menu is fairly limited, but that's actually a fantastic thing. I've so often eaten at beer focused spots that have giant menus with nothing but really terrible food to offer.  Handlebar's selection is burgers, fries, pretzels, salads, and sausage sandwiches. REALLY TASTY burgers, fries, pretzels, salads, and sausage sandwiches!! The meats are locally sourced! The flavors are brave. The fries come with a variety of dipping sauces, and each of them are exquisite.. the fries themselves are at least the best I've ever had. Really. They are. I have never made such a proclamation in regard to fries! So good! I guess they recently revamped the pretzels. I did not have their previous iteration, but the new ones are 3 sticks of carbtastic glory. They are served with a spicy mustard, and BEER CHEESE to dip in.. and the BEER CHEESE = the truth! I'd seriously eat it off of dirt. It's that good!  Be sure to stop in on Wednesday nights, around 8pm.  Team trivia, headed up by an actual host! Fun times, and super fantastic prizes!

I really didn't know what I was getting into, when my friend convinced us to go to Federal Pizza last Friday night... (insert Katy Perry sound snippet here).   We were quickly seated in a comfortable booth at the center of the restaurant, and I was able to really take in the whole dining experience, rare for the time frame in which we dined.. The style and vibe of Federal Pizza made me feel really fancy.. I felt like I was living La Dolce Vita, and then came the Pizza.  OMG.  I wasn't really sure what I was going to expect either. I was kind of taken away by the amazing sound system, and pondering the great mix of tunes, when my meatball pizza arrived. Here's where i want to say something quite sweary, but in an OMFG sort of way.. I guess I implied a swear right there, but it's for great reason.  I SWEAR this is the best pizza I've ever had. Bianco, look out, because my experience at Federal Pizza has made your pies easy to forget.  The crispy, crunchy, bubbly crust was more flavorful, and amazing than I knew pizza crust could be.. combined with the great balance of toppings, and decently substantial portion size, I'm now considering selling the sofa and TV set so I can eat at Federal Pizza for a few weeks in a row.  The value was decent, the service was swift (I do feel it could have been a dash better, but.. it was Friday..!) and the experience has me totally tickled.

I've been here a few times over the last 6 months, and every experience has been perfect. Nights out with friends, dates, and a fathers day meal with dad have all proved to be fantastic. The decor and atmosphere just absolutely incredible, and the staff is friendly and stylish. Be sure to ask what the Chef's Whim is.. today was SO AWESOME! Mortadella with pistachio, caramelized onions and pesto! Woo! The Big Star is my favorite. They also have brilliant selection of great beers and wines. The beers are so well priced.. you can't afford *not* to drink beer at Federal Pizza! ALSO! The SOUND SYSTEM here is incredible!

My beard on fleek, thanks to Ana. ( I'm pretty sure that was her name!) I dropped into this great little barber shop around 11 something AM, and totally got royalty treatment. I was a few weeks beyond my shaggy threshold, and she took all the time needed to make:  *my bald head so smooth!  *my out of control walrus mustache, into a sharp, euro-precise affair *my out of control, giant tumbleweed of a beard, into a super well shaped masterpiece. I'm thrilled with my experience at Old Phoenix Barber Parlor!

Fantastic lunch specials! Great service, awesome environment, and amazing staff! The food is super fresh, very tasty, nothing gross, greasy, or corner cutty about it.  I had the two tacos al carbon with Carne Asada and was quite impressed with the size of the meal, as well as the tastiness!  This will absolutely be my new go-to lunch spot, as I live and work in downtown Mesa!
