Nasty margarita and awful service. Came in on a Thursday night before a movie and it was not good. Maybe it's because we sat at the bar? I'm not sure, but no one wanted to help us. The house margarita was so gross, couldn't drink it. This place is like the Chili's of mexican food.

Went to the pharmacy and got the DTap vaccine today (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) and it was a super fast pleasant experience. I opted for the pharmacist to do it, and she was great! She was just so nice and I didn't even feel the needle.

They claim to have the lowest prices... They don't. I needed to buy some supplies. I checked pricing at Photo Forum and Tempe Camera. Tempe Camera was cheaper, yet the guy at Photo Forum declined to price match. No one asked if I needed help when I came in. My experience was not pleasant.  I like Tempe Camera better. They are always soo helpful and they have WAY more stuff. Not to mention they aren't smug or pretentious. Can't say the same for this place.

I do love the Cheesecake Factory. You can't really go wrong here, Pretty much every dish is gonna be good. I had the Mac & Cheese Burger. FANTASTIC! Just picture a juicy savory burger topped with a patty made of Mac & Cheese. I loved it.  My only complaint is the menu is too big! Takes me forever to pick something, Everything sounds soo good. Not a bad problem to have.

I was walking around aimlessly for 15 minutes, hoping I could get some assistance. That was wishful thinking. The staff seems to be in their own world. The Geek Squad people are even worse. There is a line of people waiting and the only employee not doing something is texting at her register. Girl I get it.. Work is boring but can you please help me right quick?  Note to Management: Arrange some customer training for your employees. I'm thinking they need a refresher course on how to deal with us. This is not a lost cause. There is definitely room for improvement.

I had the best possible experience a person can have at a Dentist office. Easily 5 stars...  My last visit to a dentist office was just plain awful and scary. So I was a bit anxious and apprehensive, but I ended up leaving with a smile on my face. The staff here are top notch professionals. They are friendly and thoughtful and made me feel completely comfortable. Jan took me back to an exam room and had me laughing and feeling right at ease. Which is pretty important in a typically unpleasant place (who likes getting their mouth poked?). She was just a wonderful and nice woman.  Then in comes Dr. Howard Farran, who had me rolling right from the get go. So funny and super knowledgeable! He seemed to take a genuine interest in my visit and made me feel like I came to the right place. I actually learned quite a bit just from talking with him. He explained all my options and his recommendations. No pressure or up-selling. Great guy. Great Doctor.  I'll be back in a couple weeks... and dare I say I'm actually looking forward to my next visit.

This review is regarding the GILBERT location, for some reason that location doesn't show up on yelp. That office is complete shit. I have had the very worst experience with them. They don't give half a shit about their patients. I had a wisdom tooth removed and was in alot of pain. I tried calling for a prescription that would actually work and they gave me a run around. Would not help me at all. The girl at the front desk gave me the wrong number to the emergency line. When I finally got ahold of an on call doctor, he was of no help and was soo rude! Like I was bothering him. Hello? I'm a patient in pain. If you don't care about that, what do you care about? I really hate this place. I will NEVER go back again. Don't waste your time or money here. It's been a nightmare. I am going to try the Tempe location, hoping I will have better luck.

The last two times I've ate here it was NOT good. It took 45 minutes for my friend and I to get salads (and no, they were not busy). The most recent time the service was poor. Took awhile to get refills. Maybe our waiter was new... Either way I don't recommend this place. After talking with friends, they all had similar stories. I like Zoe's way better (it's across the street).

I was really excited to start classes at CGCC, but the staff completely turned me off to the school. They are beyond unhelpful! They gave me the run around for weeks. Denied me financial aid, even though FAFSA approved me for 2 grants. It's been a complete nightmare trying to get enrolled and set up for school... I will definitely be going elsewhere. They are NOT friendly, or helpful. I can't say enough negative things about CGCC. I'm not a fan.

Got an email saying I could buy "VIP" tickets at a discount for the Michael McDonald show. Sweet! I bought 3 tickets. I show up and wait in a looong line, then get seated in the very back.  What I find annoying and misleading is how they said VIP tickets. There was nothing VIP about that night. Just call them "cheap general admission tickets", that way we are all on the same page, and you aren't just BS'ing to get people in, and nobody feels mislead.   UPDATE: Joseph, The manager at Tempe Improv messaged me directly and apologized for the misunderstanding, and offered to rectify the situation. I appreciate that greatly! Keep up the good work! I'm gonna bump this up to 4 stars.

Updating My Review because my opinion has changed. Clarendon used to be a sh*t hole but has made major renovations and improved the staff. I love the Clarendon.   Original: The woman who works night at the front desk is a horrible! Every time I've been here, she's been rude, and just makes your stay as awful as possible. She actually called the police on my friends and I. No phone call letting us know we needed to shut up, no warning, no nothing. When the cops came to talk to us, they were joking and laughing it up with us. They thought it was a waste of time also. We told them how the lady at the front didn't give us any kind of warning, and all 3 cops said "Yeah, she does that a lot."  She sucks. Nice hotel though.

If you do not follow instructions for your study, you can been dropped and then you wouldn't be paid. Staff was very nice and friendly. My only complaint is there is no wifi. I was there for a 9 hour sequestered study and it would have been nice to have some Internet access. Overall good experience.

I HATE Blue Wasabi. I had the WORST experience here. You couldn't pay me to consume that repulsive crap they call "Sushi".  Quick summary of my experience.... My boyfriend and I went on a date. We sat on the patio. It took FOREVER to get our food. Granted it was kinda busy, we only ordered 2 rolls & some edamame. It shouldn't take an hour & a half. The waiter offered no apologies or explanation. The rice was sooo stale & dry. Sushi looked like it had been sitting out for an hour. We couldn't even choke it down. It was horrible, no joke.  Then some poor girls purse was stolen right from the patio. Some dickhead drove up to the patio, his friend jumped out & snatched this womans purse who was dining on the patio.  It was a horrible experience. Blue Wasabi SUCKS!

This place is great! Our waitress was wonderful. Edamame & Squid Salad was perfect. The Phoenix roll was incredible. Volcano roll.... Not so much. I hated it. It was sooo mushy! It has some kind of spicy mayo in it. It seriously tasted like nothing but mayonnaise. The consistency was just mayo also. I definitely recommend this place, just watch out for the Volcano Roll.

So before I bought the Groupon for the Facial & Massage, I glanced at Beautif-Eye's yelp page and saw they had great ratings. Yay! Except no... After further reading, 90% of these great ratings are for the girl who does the eyebrow threading.  My whole experience here was quite simply... Terrible. For one... My 60 minute facial was about 35-40 minutes. I added on the microdermabrasion and Oxygenating Trio. It was a total waste. She steamed my face for maybe 15 seconds? I thought longer would have been more effective. She just kind of slab a bunch of different creams and gels, and I was done. That's it. My pores felt clogged, and my skin did not look or feel better, In fact it was worse. I get better results when I do facials at home. I was so disappointed. On to my 60 minute massage. Let me just say, I could not wait for it to be over! There is no way that "massage therapist" has any formal training or schooling. She was very nice, but so bad at giving a massage. She was basically rubbing lotion all over my back. Then she would poke at tender parts on my body, I would tense up and say "Ouch that hurts" and she would reply with "Just breath. Just keep breathing".  I was laying on the table completely tensed up & miserable, just counting the minutes till it was over. Which luckily, she cut short by about 20 minutes as well (I'm not complaining in this situation).

My stay here was really pleasant. I was here for a wedding. We got checked into our room, and 10 minutes later the front desk called to make sure we liked our room. It had a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Which was great because they had a little shop downstairs with a wide variety of snacks and microwaveable food. We got ready for the wedding and a shuttle took us to the venue and picked us back up after we were done partying. The staff were all very nice and helpful. Thanks Hampton Inn!

He just gets it. Plus he explained to me why I was having pain and soreness, and gave me tips on how to prevent it. I loved that! That's what I am looking for. I can't say enough good things. Very nice place with friendly staff. I felt amazing after wards... like I was floating. I will definitely be back.

I am thoroughly pissed off with this place.  My boyfriend and I bought 4 tickets for the Halloween party. Website said the party was till 1 am. We arrived at 11:30, got our will call tickets, and was told the party was over, and that we needed VIP tickets to get in.  The website said nothing about this, and we ended up leaving completely disappointed and ripped off. What a waste of time and money!

Theatre is very nice. Seats are not as comfortable as you would think. They have like office chairs in every other row. Also the food is not good, and it's so overpriced. Did you know it costs a dollar to put onions on your burger? Want cheese? That's another dollar. And it's not even good. Screen is beautiful and a clean picture though.. 3D was great.

I found Therapeutic Retreat on Yelp and decided to book a massage on a whim. I am so glad I did. I ending up finding my favorite masseur! I had the most incredible massage from Chad. It was a very unique and personalized massage. He did things I have never experienced before. He has vast knowledge about the human body and is very intuitive. I can be very ticklish, but he knew exactly how to handle it. Chad knows what he is doing! I was so impressed. I can not wait to come back.

I had an alignment done here, and after I drove out of there my car is still pulling to the left. The guy also said I needed to have my air filter replaced. They charge some stupid price, so after I left I just went to auto zone and bought a new one for $12.00 and I replaced it myself. It was FINE. Not dirty at all. They were just trying to get me to spend more money.  Also I overheard a customer complaining to the manager. He had been in there earlier that morning to have a tire replaced. He was back because they didn't even replace the tire! They just took his money and let him drive off with the same old tire. That's unbelievable. Good thing he checked it.  I guess this goes for every shop... THEY CAN NOT BE TRUSTED. It's pretty sad.

I hate to give one star, but even that is generous. I went to see Ghost last night and it was a disaster. To start, they only accept cash at the bar and they don't have a working ATM. Unless you are close to the stage, you're pretty much screwed. There are 3 huge beams obstructing the view of the stage. If you are standing on the 21+ side, there are several obnoxious blinding lights shining down on you, making it even harder to see the stage, also killing any kid of enjoyable atmosphere. Meanwhile in the bathroom, there was one drunk girl passed out on a couch and another throwing up in the stall. Both paper towel machines were broken. The security guards were standing around the bathroom (it's one of those community washrooms), watching me touch up my make-up, giving me thumbs up. Awkward.  There was a drunk guy stumbling around bleeding from his face. He was kicked out, but then let back in 20 minutes later. Really?   This venue could be great but it is so poorly managed. Needs some work!

I bought a groupon for a 60 minute massage. I unfortunately did not read the reviews below before I made the purchase. In retrospect, the previous reviews are 100% accurate. My experience was pretty much the same.   Although my massage wasn't completely terrible, I wish I had gone elsewhere. Yes, the massaeuse was older and it seemed difficult for her to perform a deep tissue massage. Her hands and arms were shaking from applying pressure. She was chewing gum audibly. The music selection was not relaxing by any means. Was that christian rock? Not too mention it wasn't a full hour long.   When I walked in, the receptionist had a mouth full of food. She was awkward. The entire office was pretty crappy. There was a make-shift dog play area. When I declined to purchase another massage afterwards, she seemed genuinely disappointed in my answer. Upset even. It was weird.   I hate to give such a poor score, but really... some changes need to be made.

When it comes to Little Miss BBQ the hype is very real. This is THE best BBQ in Arizona. I had the Brisket, Short Ribs, and the beans. Holy Sh*t it was incredible!!  I have only one complaint... The time you wait in line is torturous.  I went on a Saturday and was standing in line for 2 hours. I kept saying "This better be the best BBQ ever made".... Luckily it was, but still. Please move to a bigger location and hire another employee. There is only one guy dishing out the meat.  4 stars only because the line sucks. I have dreams about those short ribs!

Underground Fitness was not at all what I expected. I have never had a personal trainer before and it had been quite a while since I had worked out. I was expecting egotistical trainers and arduous workouts. This was not the case...  My trainer Jon has been awesome from the beginning. He is everything you would want in a personal trainer. He is professional, patient, and passionate about his job. He is very good at assessing your skill level and pushing you to be better and stronger. When I came in I could not do a single pull up. Now I can do 10! That is huge for me. He is encouraging and is genuinely happy for your progress and achievements.    Jon is also great about switching up your routine. He keeps training interesting and challenging. Every day is something new and that really helped me from becoming bored and losing interest. I've already lost 10 lbs. and have noticed major changes in my body. I love it!  He has been super flexible and accommodating with my schedule. If I ever needed to get in when he wasn't available, he made sure someone was there to train me (Shout out to James who is also a great trainer). He definitely goes above & beyond, and wants you to achieve your goals.   Every week Jon helps me become a little more bad-ass and I am forever grateful.

I decided to try this new eyebrow threading spot out. I always get nervous about waxing or threading at a new place. My brows are already pretty thin... one wrong move and the whole thing could be gone! However the girl who did my brows listened to what I wanted and only "cleaned 'em up". They look great!  I used the Yelp check in offer. They didn't know it was on here but they happily obliged. Nice ladies. I will be back.

I have become obsessed with King Gyros. It's a problem. I have cravings for the Chicken Schwarma plate on a daily basis. It is so delicious and I never want to anything ever again. The Tzatziki sauce is perfect. The Falafel is perfect. I am a huge fan.
