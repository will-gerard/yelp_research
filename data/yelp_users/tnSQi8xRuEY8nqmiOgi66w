Found 2 long nice pieces of hair in my salad. Not to happy about that. I'm a big fan of this chain of restaurant always have been they never really let me down at all. So I was surprised to find two pieces of hair in my food. the lady who gives you your refills was super friendly and attentive. And the rest of the food was good like it usually is. Some of the workers at this location though back behind in the kitchen on the salad bar side where I found my hair don't look too happy and I did see a couple of them practice some unsanitary techniques by on the salad bar side. I don't know but the manager needs to check out the lady who preps the salad area.

Sat the bar and received very good service from Bethany and she also had very good recommendations on items on the menu. She was very knowledgeable and friendly. Next time I'm in surprise I'll definitely stop back there and grab the jammin jalapeno hot wings extra crispy. I am a hot wing connoisseur and I won hot wings competition... Don't get me wrong there wings are good but they don't compare to Wingstop. The flavor on the jammin jalapeno was actually extremely satisfying like I said I just wish they had been a little bit more crispy

Ordered the Lechon plate with the sweet cucumber. I was kinda sad...my rice was warmer than the entree. And the flavor was not as bold as I imagined it would have been. Also had the pork skewer....amazing flavor I must say! Next time im gonna order the BBQ Beef Plate. The halo-halo was delicious as always. Im gonna come as often as I can so I can start knockin down everything on the menu...one by one.

Ordered the salsita  bowl with Red Chile as the choice for meat... For the price it was good portion size and the red chili was actually pretty tasty. They didn't have paper towels in the bathroom they just had napkins like the ones that you eat with. The lady at the register was very friendly though. It reminded me eating at my grandma's house after I ordered went to the bathroom and came out the friendly woman was bringing me my food in the bowl with no tray... Just like at grandma's house. Definitely going to be stopping back by over here to try out there other food items

Ordered the gold hot wings had them  sit in the fryer little bit longer the owner guaranteed me if they weren't the best wings I ever had that they were free.... He was very adamant about he would guarantee me the winds were free if I didn't like them. So I ordered the wings and the flavor for the golden hot was actually surprisingly pretty tasty. I shook the owner's hand when he said he guaranteed me that the wings would be the best I ever had and I was going to hold him to it. And when the wings came to the table they were actually very enjoyable. It only took about I'm minute and a half for somebody to be coming to take my order. I was overall pleased with the restaurant.
