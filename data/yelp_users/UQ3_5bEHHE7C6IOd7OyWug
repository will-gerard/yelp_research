Great food in the crappiest suburb of Phoenix.  Shoot me if I ever say I am moving to Phoenix.  I see old people...  I came here for dinner both nights last weekend, sat at the bar, drank Asahi and ate specialty rolls.  Friday night: Sex on the Beach (apparently not just a girly cocktail) and sea weed salad.  Very non-traditional: tasty tuna served in quarters of fried banana with spikes of seaweed. Nice julienned white radish in the center. Served without ginger or wasabi. Good sea weed salad. Went at 7 pm and place was full of 20 something trendy, trashy bar types, plus some families. Was immediately sat a the bar, otherwise would have waited for a table.  Saturday night: Fewer people at 8pm. Sat next to nice guy who had dropped his kids at the Free Zone. Specialty roll: Very spicy tuna roll with mango and it was. Came with wasabi only, but I did  not need it lol.  Again with the spiky seaweed. Side of cucumber salad good contrast to spiciness of roll. Fair green tea icecream afterward.  Such a pleasure to find this place.  Thank you local Yelpers, you did not fail me.  Nice patio seating, even if in a parking lot next to Payless (great landmark).

Store-bought corn chips, weak salsa, soggy beef and bean tostada, a very non-crispy crispy chicken taco, and an okay tasting margarita on the rocks that was 3/4 crushed ice...am I in Arizona?

Let the manager pick your dishes if you are a big group and you won't leave hungry or disappointed.  Perfect combination of flavors in every dish. Spiciness spot on with request. Quick and friendly service. Loved the tofu and garlic sauce dish. Go early.

Oh Banh Ti, how I have missed you! Cute mom and pop sandwich shop with some homemade goodies on display, tables, so it does not feel like a mini-market. Located in a semi-derelict Asian mall which I hope does not close.  Rap/Hip Hop stores also here.  And a few homeless people.

We were so hoping the next door Health Food store was associated with this cafe.  Came for Sunday lunch during an educational course located nearby, so options were limited.  Opened the door and received a potent blast of greasy meat smells that set me (omnivore) and my dining partner (vegetarian) running for the door.  To the patio seating.  Thank good they had a good spinach salad. Generous with sliced hard boiled egg.  Mine had one whole slice of well done bacon on top.

Disappointing :(  I was dying for frozen yogurt, wish I had checked to see if Red Mango has hit Phoenix.  Had a scoop of chocolate that was ok.  Unfortunately I also ordered the coconut, which tasted like sunscreen, and ruined my palate for the chocolate.  I think this is the first time I have ever thrown a dessert away in my life.

Trendy, popular spot in NoDA (Charlotte art district). Pepper and sausage crepe with purple (!) cole slaw purple very good. Charcuterie appetizer kinda small for $12, but had great olives that I had never had before and they had no pits!  Generous side salad Mushroom spinach crepe goat cheese so so according to one of fellow diners. Good service.  Very popular so go early before Gallery Crawl. We parked in the YMCA lot for free.

Nice clean spacious room with window that could actually be opened :) 24/7 access to free snacks (coffee, pop, granola bars, fruit, juice, milk, candy...) in a card key accessed large nook over lobby.  Free wifi, handy desktops and printer in snack nook.  Kind of difficult to find if you don't realize it is on the campus of the Thunderbird School of Global Management.  Felt very safe. Security is good. Staff is friendly. Guests are normal people (sometimes, this is not a given).  Great value for price.  If I ever have to stay in a crappy suburb of Phoenix again, this would be my first choice.
