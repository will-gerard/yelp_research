I really wanted to like this place to support local small businesses...however, the food was not all that exciting.  The best part of the meal were the mini-muffins.  It went downhill after that.  I ordered the Cajun eggs Benedict.  The eggs were cooked nicely but the Cajun sauce just didn't taste right.  When I was in NOLA the sauce had a much better flavor and depth.  This one missed the spot.  The kielbasa tasted more like hot dogs.   Sad to say, if it weren't for the muffins, I would have only given 1 star.  The mini muffins are worth a trip but that's it.

Definitely the best pho in the west side. To me the most important part of the pho is the broth - they have the most flavorful broth.  The only one that comes close is Pho Thanh in terms of flavor.  43rd Express is also very good.  Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of good pho places in Phoenix.  I would say that they are the best though.  You cannot go wrong with Little Saigon.

Food = 3 stars Value = 4 stars Service (really really slow) = 3 stars   Average = 3-4 stars  The food is decent for the price.  You get a lot for your buck.  The first time I came to this restaurant I got the combination Gyu Don and Hot Udon (food was okay, not amazing).  The next time we went to this restaurant I got Spicy Tuna Don and Spicy Ramen (The Tuna don was really good, ramen was okay).    Decent food (food that is hard to find in Phoenix), great Value!

I have decided....Los Reyes De La Torta is my favorite place for Mexican Food.  I  would consider myself a Mexican food fan.  I have lived in Phoenix for over 20 years and I even had a Mexican roommate who made awesome Mexican food all the time.  So I think I know my Mexican.  This was probably my fourth visit to Los Reyes.  My wife and I decided to have Mexican food for Cinco de Mayo.  I tried several new things.  I started off with the Tosada de Ceviche (Shrimp Ceviche) - Awesome flavors - just the right amount of lime/lemon and salt.  YUM!!!  Then I went with the Peluche plate packed with goodies (The steak was nicely seasoned and blended well with the sausage, ham, grilled onions, grilled peppers, pineapple, jalapenos).  My wife got the always amazing Del Rey.  We also threw on a plate of Chiles Toreados (grilled jalapeno and onions).  Everything was fantastic.  Oh yeah - they also have great Aqua Frescas.  We have taken out-of-town guests to this restaurant who also loved it.  My wife and I are surprised that we don't come here more often.    Other items that I've tried at Los Reyes that I liked as well.  Tacos de Cabazea Tacos de Asada Torta Nortena with Steak (Tacos de Lengua - not 100% sure that I have tried it here...)  I reserve my 5 star ratings for only my favorite restaurants - Los Reyes is definitely one of them!

This will be my Mexican restaurant for out-of-towners.  The ambience is hip and cool (has a Brooklyn/Williamsburg feel to the place).  It's not your typical authetic Mexican Restaurant.    For a frame of reference - I really love street Mexican food - Cabeza, Lengua, Chicharone, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Al Pastor Tacos - Not the restaurant for these types of tacos (La Salsita, Ta Carbon is where I'd go)  For dinner, my fiance and I got way too much food...  Prickly Pear Margarita - on the sour side - not bad though Guacamole (made from scratch) - really really good, but I can make it at home Oaxacan Tamale (wrapped with banana leave) - very good flavor Pork Taco - not bad Beef (Carne Asada) Taco - very good flavor, goes great with the salsa Fish Taco - very good as well, flaky meat this is not too dry and yet flavorful Beef Torta - probably my least favorite dish...don't get me wrong, the meat is very good and tasty and the bread is good - just not my cup of tea Posole - nice broth that comes to life after you add all the garnish and the chili sauce (I think it's Guajillo chili but I am not 100% sure)  Not a very expensive bill even though we got all this food - we had a lot of leftovers.    If you are looking for a Mexican restaurant that is unique, hip, cool to out-of-towner...look no further than Gallo Blanco.

Awesome Pho!  One of the best in the valley.  Probably the BEST bang for the buck for Pho.

Friendly staff, good food.    My wife and I got their Pad-see-ew, Pa-Nang curry with beef, and finished with their Sweet rice with Thai Mango.    Everything was really good.  Excellent flavor combination.  The Pad-see-ew had the perfect amount of heat on them (spicy and temperature).  The needles had a nice thin char to them which was perfect - the dish was cooked perfectly.    The Pa-Nang curry was also very flavorful and my wife (generally does not like spicy food) thought that it was very good.  Their sweet rice with Mango was perfect to end the course.  If you have never tried that dish.  I suggest that you try it at least once.  Granted - the mango has to be in season for it to be good (thus seasonal)    We will definitely be coming back.  This restaurant is probably our favorite Thai in the area.  We'll give the other restaurants a try before we come back just to be fair.  However, we have a feeling that we'll be back real soon.

I needed to pick up some flowers for my lovely fiance.  I looked on Yelp for a good florist and Wolz's was the highest on the list.  They did not disappoint.  The price was reasonable.  The owners were very nice and we had a great conversation.  I was able to pick out the flowers that I liked.  My fiance really liked her flowers - the arrangement was beautiful.  Would definitely use again in the future.
