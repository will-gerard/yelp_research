The salmon was burned and the rice was gross. They only had three choices for steaks. The service was VERY slow.

Best customer service I've ever seen! They really do make you feel like family. The food is great too, free garlic knots and zappolis for 1st time visitors. The owner comes out and goes around asking how the food and experience is. It was soo busy but well worth the wait, we will be back!

If there was an option for zero stars I would give this place that. Wish I had read the reviews first! Horrible place!  They did an aweful job on our minivan and when I asked them to ensure they vacuum out the van they tried twice and still missed everything in the third row seats. Please don't waist your time (there for over an hour) or money at this place!
