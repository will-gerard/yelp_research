The staff was fantastic. The owner was delightful. However, the food was much to be desired. Small portions, the New York strip and arugula was very bland. The red snapper with clams should have come with a pasta or even a salad. The salmon was over cooked and the balsamic glaze was overpowering. Really nice people, really bad overpriced food. We did take home some tiramisu. Surprisingly it was actually quite tasty.

Went with my husband and 3 kids (one is a 15mo old toddler) to the Gilbert location.  After reading the reviews about the wilted salad lettuce and hit or miss sides, I was a little nervous. My salad was awesome, I think that bad salad review was a year ago, so I guess they hear us. The ribs were so tender and falling off the bone, the beef brisket was good too. The smoked chicken wasn't my favorite, we took that home as left overs and it tasted better the next day...who knew? The fried corn on the cob was great too. The coleslaw  & baked potato was average. The decor was funny, filled with silly signs about humanity and hogs  I really, really, really, loved their sauces! Will definitely go back soon.

Stayed here for 1 night. Modern facility with wifi. The room was comfortable, a little small, but nice modern contemporary style. No funny smells. The shower adjusted for height, which is a super bonus for us tall people out there. Didn't give it 5 stars because they could have had some complimentary muffins or cereal at breakfast. I ended up ordering an spinach omelet which was good. Staff was friendly too.

Came here today for the first time. I ordered half size of the Heart Healthy Salad with optional chicken.  Since I am trying to track my macros it is really great to order something fresh and you can see what you are eating to track. The salad was fresh and super tasty. The staff was friendly and gave me a water to go. Definitely will be back.

I am always so surprised when I order off the menu! The food is fresh and so tasty and the chicken hash is one of my favorites. This little place is often crowded and the wait staff is busy, but I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes. They do a great job.

My order is wrong 80% of the time. I think I will frequent the other coffee shops instead.

Stopped in for lunch after getting my iPhone fixed next door. It is counter service and not a full service sit down. I ordered the Greek salad with chicken. Friendly service and the salad came out quickly and it was huge! I could eat the other half for dinner. Definitely recommend this place.

Bomb diggety, that's all you need to know. Not a fancy restaurant and it so doesn't  matter when the burgers are this delicious.

Food was good. But terribly inefficient line. 3 people helping one lady with 3 other people in line. Had to wait for the guy to finish making a smoothie before he could even take my order. Hope they get their stuff together. It really makes for a bad experience when you stopped in for a quick lunch before a movie over at Harkins.
