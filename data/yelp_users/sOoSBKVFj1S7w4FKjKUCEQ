We love this pizza joint so much, we've become regulars. All of the wait staff are great, but Nick, the bartender is our favorite. Gregarious and always has a welcoming smile. (Eat in the bar area to get quick seats and service)  Being a gluten free couple, we typically struggle finding restaurant options, but PP never lets us down. With their tasty gluten free appetizers, gf pizza crusts and most importantly Gf desert options- it's easy for us to invite friends and family and not feel like anyones food options are limited. Whether your gluten free or gluten full- PP is a great option for dining out in a friendly, casual, yet classy restaurant. You won't be disappointed!

With new breakfast places popping up all over the valley, Butters stands out from the rest. Can't say enough good things about this place! We typically go with friends out for breakfast after our long run on the weekend and this is always my first choice. The portions are big, their coffee is excellent and I love that they have good tasting gluten free pancakes. Great value, lots of food, and tastes great... what more can you ask for.

One of our favorite places for weekend breakfast in North Scottsdale. We can usually get a seat quickly, the staff are SUPER friendly and accommodating to our dietary restrictions and the menu is FANTASTIC!! Generous portions, healthy options and they offer gluten free, which I always appreciate.   Yesterday my friend tried the snickerdoodle pancakes and wow, talk about Yum. The smell alone made my mouth water. Oh and the staff pay attention to details. Like my side of fruit...all nicely cut and placed in the bowl with care. (Yes, I notice and appreciate the details Soul Cafe chef:)  I've been here a couple of times for dinner as well and I've always been impressed. Just really good home cooked food, with flavorful ingredients and healthy options.  In a town full of chain restaurants, Soul Cafe stands out from the rest and seems to just keep getting better and better.

Last night was our first time at Isabella's.  When friends suggested we go there, we right away got online to check out the yelp reviews.  Based on comments, we had low expectations.  But WOW were we blown away!   From the moment we entered the door, the hostesses were extremely friendly.  The place was jam packed with people, so the energy was great. We sat inside and our server, Thad, was amazing. Super friendly, always smiling, and very attentive. To top it off, the food was tasty! Based on a previous review, we ordered the kale salad with chicken (and they loaded on the chicken!), and a pizza. We will most certainly be back!!  If your looking for a fun lively atmosphere, with great energy, good service, good food and an amazing setting- don't pass up Isabella's.  Especially idea for out of town guests or clients.

Really wanted to love this place and had high hopes based on the reviews, but was disappointed. My Mom and I ordered the chicken and veggie soup, which was really good as our appetizers. For lunch we had the shawarma and the grilled chicken with a side of steamed veggies. Both the chicken and the meat were extremely dry. The flavor was good, but just way too dry. Unfortunately, we won't be back.

We LOVE this place! What it lacks in atmosphere it more than makes up for in flavor. We usually get the Pad Thai and Chicken Coconut Curry which always exceeds our expectations.  Recently we brought a family member there and she ordered the Eggplant- the flavor was outstanding. We asked the waitress what the sauce ingredients were and she was so nice. She actually wrote the ingredients down and took pics of the specific brand of items so we could find them at the Asian store. She went above and beyond. We like spicy but not too hot. We order between 2-3 depending on the cook but have learned its better to go with a 2 and add a bit of our chili spice than to order a 3 and it be too spicy to enjoy. We've never done take out, but from the amount of people that pick up every time we are there, it must be good. The place is a bit dark, decor is odd and the lighting isn't perfect, but for a casual meal that is consistently tasty, you can't go wrong.

Went there with family for a Saturday brunch at 11a.m. Made reservations a few days ahead of time, which helped expedite getting our table. Several of us ordered a Bloody Mary, which was divine! The Bloody Mary prep guy could have had more personality and generally been more friendly (because seriously, what a cool job to have), but oh well.  We ordered several different things off the menu and everything was tasty. The atmosphere was very lively and fun. Some people were dressed in workout clothes and casual, and some were fancied up a bit. Diverse crowd, which was nice.  All in all, my only wish is that they had more gluten free options, but regardless I will for sure be back.

Decided to check it out as I was driving from Tempe to Scottsdale over the weekend and needed a coffee fix.  Loved that there was a Yelp Coupon. Ordered an Americano w/caramel sauce, along with a coconut mocha. The mocha was pretty tasty, but unfortunately the Americano wasn't so great, with no strong espresso flavor at all and it wasn't very hot- just luke warm.  I've been wanting to try Kona 13 because there is a location close to my house in North Scottsdale, but based on this experience, I  won't be going out of my way any time soon. Disappointed as I was really hoping it was going to be as good as all the reviews.  On a positive note, I did like that they had Non-gmo coconut milk and low calorie/sugar almond milk as options for lattes and cream.  The girl helping us was also super friendly, which is always nice.

So the first time we tried out SumoMayo was opening weekend. Wasn't at all impressed. But went again last night for a friends birthday and wow, they've come a long way! The chips and pomegranate guac were awesome.  For dinner, I ordered the chopped salad and it was much larger than I expected with tons of veggies and super flavorful. I asked the waiter if they had another dressing option, like balsamic vinegar or anything else and he said no, which was surprising since their other salads had different dressing options? So instead I used some the soy sauce on the table and it was a-ok. My husband got the ceasar salad, which was also generously sized and very tasty.  Everyone in our party was happy with their meals and and then the desserts...wow, everything was so yum! Glad we had the opportunity to give it another try and will certainly be back.  **fyi- it is a bit loud and difficult to carry conversations across the table***

Loved the ambiance of this place. Classy and comfortable. Unfortunately, wasn't impressed with the food. Our table started with the donut and Nutella appetizer which looked amazing and our friends said it was delicious. But my main course of the gluten free pancakes was unimpressive. Over cooked on the bottom and really hard. I had to dip them in my coffee to soften them. No Bueno. In addition, my white scramble was only ok. Nothing special and kinda bland. For a $20 meal, was hoping for better. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is 5 star, too bad the food isn't up to snuff. Haven't found a place yet to compete with Butters down the street for eggs and gf pancakes at a great price.
