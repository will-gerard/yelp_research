This use to be my favorite sports bar. Unfortunately, the food the service and pricing all suck.. They nickel and dime you for everything extra sauce extra ranch for $1.50 they will split a meal for you??? The wings use to rock now they are average at best. They usually don't have enough sauce and are undercooked. The service is a joke the services is slow sometimes rude and managers are worthless. Avoid this Zipps

Great service food is amazing and atmosphere works. Bring friends family and be ready to get messy. Try the bag with your favorite and spice it up plenty big enough to share.

What horrible service. My grandson cracked his head by the table tennis. We notified them if this dangerous area. The manager stated that this area is for adults and gave a band aid. No signs no apologies very sad experience F em.  Yes he was supervised he was playing with his mother. The dangerous area was a bad weld that needs to be smoothed out.

No Bueno. Worst burger I have ever had. This place needs help. Maybe the beer is OK skip the food and service is average at best. Two thumbs down for this joint.
