If waiting a long time in a waiting room is your cup of tea, this guy is your guy..   I got there 2 minutes early and while the waiting room emptied and refilled around me, I kept waiting and waiting..  After well over an hour of sitting in the waiting room, I decided life was too short and left.  He might be a decent doc but I value my time way to much to put up with someone who doesn't.

Awesome food.  Beer battered veggie portobello rolls are extremely good.   Great place.

Really really great food,  great service.  The garlic bread is ridiculously great.  Seems like everything is made from scratch.  Great value to,  not expensive.   A++++++

This place is really bad.  Not sure how you can have such bad service when its so empty but they pulled it off.  The food made me sick.  I am sure there are no stray dogs or cats in the area because the pork I had tasted like something totally different  Will not be back here.  What a waste of a meal

The best hospital experience ever.. period.   This place is special.  No long waiting.  Thorough treatment from people who love their job (or they are exceptional at faking it).  If I ever need treatment from a hospital,. Will not go anywhere else.

Kinda wish I would have went to AJ's instead and bought some penne with rao's vodka sauce instead.  Food was very average, and portion size was small compared to most Italian places.   Wasn't cheap either.  Overall not a good value.

Like eating from my grandma's kitchen.  Really good and shockingly inexpensive for what ya get.  I'm only pissed I didn't find this place years ago.  Kinda tucked away and not easy to see.

The only good car wash in Scottsdale and the food is ridiculously good.  So funny that this is a gas station, because sometimes I come here just to eat,  its that good
