Vartan was my "Master Yoda" when I started cigars in 2006.  If you buy a few sticks, he'll pick one that he thinks you might like, and throw it in gratis.  If you get a dud stick (het, it happens), he'll replace it.

Given that my wife grew up in Chandler, I was surprised that we hadn't found this place earlier.  Awesome!

My office is across the street and I had my first dinner there a few weeks ago.  Culinary wizardry! Wild Boar meatball appetizer is nor to be missed. Flatiron steak with what tempura-like plantains (bananas) on the side was awesome.

I've never had a meal that I didn't like here.   They have a prime rib that literally makes the table tilt (it's so big).  The pretzel bread is so amazing that you have to be careful not to spoil your appetite.

Awesome. Bartender let us sample a few wines before we bought a bottle.  Fingerling potato appetizer was great.

So I wasn't planning on staying over in Phoenix last night but decided to squeeze in a business dinner only to find that nearly every hotel on Scottsdale Road from Camelback to Shea was booked.  I called the Montelucia and a very nice lady at a central reservation place set me up and told me the rate was $249.  More than I wanted to spend but, since it was 10:00pm and I was tired, I went with it.  I was greeted by a friendly valet who informed me that there was a $19/day valet fee.  "Are you freakin' kidding me" I exclaimed to which he apologetically responded that I was welcome to park the car myself.    Enter the lobby....  I am greeted by an impeccably dressed gentleman who quickly finds my reservation and tells me about the $24 / resort fee which covers the pool, internet and parking. "So does the resort fee include the valet parking" I asked?  "No, it only includes self parking" he responded.  "Are you freakin' kidding me" I exclaimed (again).  He then offered to have the valet come up and bring my car back so that I could self-park it if I wanted.  At this point, I started my rant.  "You people must be high, and i don't mean your prices, seriously....  on a $249 room, you expect me to pay an additional $43 for the use of the pool, internet and the privilege of parking my own car - all of which is taxable at monster bed tax rates?  Just give me the key and tell me where my room is."   I was shown a map of the grounds and the directions to my room were circuitous, requiring walking through an outside lounge.  I asked if a bellman could take me.  "Of course sir, a bellman can take you in a golf cart if you just step outside by the fountain."    I walk out to the fountain with my bag and wait for about a minute, but no bellman.  I yell over to the 2 guys behind the valet desk (both of whom know I have been standing there), "can one of you take me to my room?"  Well sir, the bellman will be back in about 5 minutes but you can walk to your room in less than 5 minutes."  "Seriously? You want me to walk across the property (outside) in the dark for 5 minutes,  through the seating area of a restaurant / lounge, around the pool area.  You guys don't have another golf cart?"  Sorry sir...     The one star above was for the nicely appointed room.    At checkout, I found that I had been charged $15.99 for internet service that was supposed to be included in the "resort fee."  The charge was promptly reversed.  This experience is actually going to motivate me to write a letter to the management of the hotel (which I have NEVER done before).  I wonder if they offer me a complimentary stay, if I will still need to pay the resort fee?

My Surface Pro 4 was doing some odd things and I brought it to the MS Store in Fashion Square.  The tech guy who helped me (Justin) was just awesome.  Very knowledgeable, friendly (let me use his iPhone Mophie when my phone was dying) and went above and beyond to get my issue solved (which he did successfully).  As a long-time Apple (Mac) user, getting a Surface was a big (and dreaded) deal.  Having this resource down the street makes me feel much better about the decision to get one.

Dropped off my son's iphone 5 for screen replacement and they told me it would be 20-30 mins (sounded great).  The guys were friendly and actually got it done in LESS than 20 mins.  While paying $90 to replace the glass is frustrating, its WAY less than having the Apple Store do it and I didn't have to make an appointment or deal with a packed store.  While I hope I don't need them again, these guys have earned my future apple device repair business!
