we come here a couple of times a week even though we live 30 minutes away. I love the mocha and black and white. My husband always gets the red eye. I miss them doing a rotating menu each night but I understand that must be difficult. The menu that they've adopted is a lot of what they offered before and still delicious. Everyone is super nice and always answers any questions you have about the menu. The always changing pastries are my favorite! We especially love the thumbprint cookies and oatmeal cream pies but everything we've had is amazing!

Food is always delicious and I always leave feeling like I'm friends with my server! So friendly and good at what they do :) my husband and I always get the calamari, pear salad and share a pizza. And if we have room, a crepe. So good!

Picking up 2 prescriptions for my dogs who ingested pieces of a severely toxic sego palm tree from the back yard. After a 4 hour vet appointment, came to fill the scripts. Staff is nice, but was told 20-30 minutes at 9:10. It's now 10:05 and was told another 20 minutes. It's now 10:30 and still no medicine. My dogs are on the edge of possible liver failure and the medicine that I need will stop the toxins from metabolizing in their bodies. We are all important patients, so it is unfortunate that me and the other 10 people here have to wait so long for important medicine! One man is here is picking up medicine for his wife who just got out of the hospital! I do feel bad for the girl in the front, she has been yelled at by multiple patients so trying my best to be positive and nice, but worried about my pups at home!   Walgreens, please address this issue with the pharmacy! It seems by reading the reviews that this is a common occurrence. :(

We love the chicken satay appetizer and always get spicy noodles with a Thai tea! Service is always fast and the staff is great. Love this place and happy to see a decent Thai place on the west side!

I love giant! I always go for the honey vanilla latte..hot or iced, they are both good. The pastries are usually pretty good and the breakfast burritos are worth the 20 minute wait! The only thing that I don't like about giant is the staff. Most everyone is kind of stand offish and curt. Other than that I love the ambiance, especially with the windows open! Not to mention, giant is next to bunky! We always drink our coffee and then walk over and shop :)

I love Westbrook! We have brought both of our dogs here, with our little chihuahua being a VERY frequent patient there. Most recently, she and our our boxer mix were exposed to sago Palm. We of course freaked out, brought them in and Dr. Smith started them on a regimen that my husband and I were both comfortable with. They give you a quote before anything is done with a "high" and a "low" end. You are free to tweak it as you wish. We normally se Dr. Hummel but Dr. Smith was amazing and got our sweet pups started on the long road of healing!  As for Dr. Hummel, he did a luxating patella and cruciate repair on our little chihuahua. The surgery failed and he waived his fee for a redo surgery and tweaked his surgery approach since it didn't work the first time. We're happy to report Ellie is doing so well almost a year after the surgery.   The staff is top notch and making appointments is always a breeze. Not to mention they are open 7 days a week! The staff loves every animal that walks in the door as if they were their own. I love it here!

love this dog park! I have a big and small dog and have been to both. Super clean and filled with people who love and care about their dogs. People are always making sure there are toys and poop is picked up if there is any left from other careless owners!

I must say I don't like Chinese food.  Never have, never thought I would. Until this place. My fiance loves it, and I cringe anytime when he wants to go to an Asian restaurant. We walked in on a Saturday night and it was empty. A bad sign in my book. The hostess was sweet and sat us immediately. We ordered pot stickers. Amazing. I ordered the curry chicken and it was good! I don't normally like curry, but it appealed to me. My fiance had the Thai basil chicken and it was so flavorful. A woman, maybe the owner?, brought over a sample of Miona's chicken. It is now our favorite dish. Since, we have been back almost every week and had an array of dishes like shrimp fried rice, sun devil chicken, beijing beef, and chow mein dishes and have loved every single one! If you're ever in the area, don't miss out!

This review is based solely on the process of cancelling. They never answer their phones and the owner is never there to cancel a membership. We moved an hour away (our reason for cancelling) and have driven there NO LIE 15+ times to cancel, with no one there. Blows my mind! Before we moved, our bank randomly sent us a new debit card, so we tried to call the gym a few times to update the card number for them to run our payment, no one answered and then they tacked on late fees. LOL They have some balls that's for sure!

Finally got our membership canceled after unanswered Facebook messages, unreturned voicemails and finally commenting on a picture on Instagram. YEAH. Apparently, you have to reach out on social media to get an answer because what kind of business actually answers their business phone!? I attached pictures of our conversation saying he canceled our membership, although I never got the "cancel letter" he was supposed to email. I have a feeling they will try to charge another month's fee next month, so I put a block on our bank account, just in case they try.  Josh, the owner blocked me on Instagram after he found out I contacted the BBB. Well, the BBB gives businesses a month to respond and he chose not to respond in that month, so I can't understand his anger. I hope he enjoys the action we had to take with the attorney general's office as well. I cannot say enough horrible things about this gym and the fuckery involved in communicating with their staff. In short: AVOID THIS BUSINESS LIKE THE PLAGUE! Unless of course, you never want to cancel a membership, in which you should be fine.

My husband and I visited First Watch this morning. There was a 30 minute wait but we decided to sit outside and enjoy the weather..we were seated after about 15-20 minutes. It took a while for our waitress to come greet us, but it was also nice because we had time to review the menu and order drinks and meals at the same time. I tried the kale tonic juice, it was delicious. It had kale, apple, cucumber and lemon, I believe. I ordered the avocado toast which was 2 pieces of toast with smashed avocado, sea salt and a lemon  wedge to squeeze on top. It also came with eggs, totaling 8.99. I thought that was a bit expensive, however it filled me up and was very tasty. I also ordered a side of their potatoes for 2.99 because I thought I would still be hungry. I didn't even need them because the toast and eggs were so filling! My husband had the brisket hash, which was also very good. It had potatoes, eggs, roasted onions, kale, maple bbq sauce and of course brisket. Our total for avocado toast (8.99), kale tonic (3.99), side of potatoes (2.99), and brisket hash (9.99), we paid 28.61 plus a $5 tip. Only downfall was that our waitress didn't really come to our table at all to check in and our drinks were empty for majority of the meal. She was nice though and it was very busy so I understand! We will definitely be back!
