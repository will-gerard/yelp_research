Love this spot. Easy menu but still interesting. Great staff. Patient and make suggestions. Will customize anything. Cool atmosphere and a little less overwhelming than your usual Starbucks. Love having them close by. Try the funky monkey of you get a chance.

One of the best libraries in the Phoenix area. Great activities, awesome selection and the librarians are great! Keep checking out the kids programs and other calendar of events. Free wifi, tons of resources. Inter-library loan is fabulous. Try to come here often since the offerings change frequently.

Exactly what you want in a place like this. Classic and Kitschy. The chickens great the waffles were good,cheesy grits were cold. Excellent house drinks like the orange Creamsicle amazing. The waitstaff are impressively friendly and very fun. Not entirely family-friendly. That could've been because we had a very unhappy 11-month-old with us. Will definitely go back no kids next time.

I love this place. From open jump with my kids to the exercise classes. So fun, reasonably priced, and very clean. They have a good order of things, great team, and friendly vibe. An easy way to stay active when being outside isn't an option. The team members are always on point keeping kids safe, making allowances for special needs, and always willing to help. I plan to keep coming here for a long time; with my kids and my adult friends.

I think I found my new favorite local coffee shop. I am a Dutch Brothers girl for sure but this place is local and great. Each employee i have met knows their stuff. They don't try to upsell you on something you won't like just to make a buck. The owner is passionate about GOOD coffee. A trait I appreciate. Prices are on par with the big box retailers but service is faster and friendlier than most. I recommend the Iced Mocha Bianca. Great refreshing pick me up for AZ summer mornings.

I keep trying to like these guys. For a short time they had a really friendly drive thru crew. But they don't last. And they CAN NOT get a food order done in the drive thru. I always have to park and wait for someone to bring my sandwich out.... If everyone else can make food in the drive thru, why can't Dunkin make toast?? I know.. First world problems, but get it together DD.

Holy opening weekend batman. I'm excited they are opening a location here in the west valley. I love Winco's low price, basic model. No frills but always good quality. Also, just like their other locations, I found the staff friendly, attentive, and helpful. Makes shopping for a family of 6 bearable. I will however try not to go on Saturday mornings. It's a madhouse in there. Definitely worth checking out.
