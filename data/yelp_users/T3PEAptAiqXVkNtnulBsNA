I don't even want to give it one star, they are a big rip off! They used to be good, now they no longer care about customer service.. Just how much can they make while you are there...

I am a guy that loves to go out to dinner. Whether it's with my kids, by myself or the whole family.. I love a good restaurant. I also know when to spot a crappy one. Tonight, my son found a rock, yes I said a rock, in his refried beans! It was awful. I brought it to the attention of my server, who assured me that he would let his manager know. We waited and waited and the only thing that happened that server brought me a bill! No apology, no nothing????? It was the worst exhibition of restaurant management ever. When I spoke to the manager, he almost looked at me like I put the stone in my sons food. I have never been as angry as I was at that moment... Do yourself a favor and stay away... Don't risk your meal, enjoy any other restaurant. Obviously this place has front of the house issues as well as the back the house!

This is another great little sports bar where you can feel very comfortable taking your kids. I always hesitate about "bar" restaurants, they are a risk for bad language and bad behavior, but NOT this place, they are awesome!  Menu is very diverse from Mexican to Italian, from wings (really good too) to a fantastic beef dip! The girls that wait on you are attentive, beautiful and very good at what they do.... Go and enjoy.....

I have been stopping by this establishment every week for the last 3 months. They are very kind and helpful. They are perfectly attentive to your needs and the food is wonderful.  If you go at lunch you will be pleasantly surprised. They offer a lunch combo that starts you off with either egg drop soup or hot & sour. If you ask for wonton its available for a small upcharge. Then on to the wonton chips with spicy mustard and sweet sauce. Then you plate arrives with just the right sized entree, rice, egg roll and crab puff stuffed with actual crab! What a concept!  Treat yourself, I do!!!!!!  By the way, all of that for under 10 bucks....

I love this place...the shredded beef has been freshly prepared every time I go, the hardshell tacos are not the healthiest, but who eats Mexican for the health food! Love the hot sauce, love the place!

This is "my" kind of bar. You can bring your kids here and the atmoshere is kind and safe. People are respectful, not like other bar/restuarants. Come on over, the owner is usually here and working hard. Food is great too....

This place is malto bene! The owner is honest and sincere and has a love for his business. The waiter was great and was really good with the kids. Linen tablecloths and napkins, I felt underdressed in khakis and a polo! But everyone was dressed casual....  The antipasto salad served 2 adults and 3 boys.... Fantastic with fresh meats and cheeses, crisp lettuce and artichoke hearts.  The saltimbocca was wonderful and the gnocchi's were cooked perfect.  Enjoy this little, tucked away bistro....ask for a grappa.... Really generous and good tasting!

This is one of last "true family integrated" businesses! You need to find a way to get here. The multiple varieties of "dogs" and sausages are wonderful. My kids love the attention they get from the staff, makes them feel great! Try and go next Friday or Saturday to try their authentic South Carolina Barbeque! Fantastic food, fantastic fun, fantastic family business.....

You gotta love private owned diggs! If you like mediterranean food try the shwarma! If you are looking for an inexpensive breakfast, they start at $3.99! Go and enjoy....

Family owned business with some fantastic NY style bagels! They are the old time hand rolled, boiled then baked bagels. They are ALWAYS fresh and tasty. If you don't go you will be doing yourself an injustice....

If you want to go to a Pizza place where you ...treated like family....spoiled by the management.... Treated to ALL homemade thin crust pizza, oval shaped is their trademark.... Homemade Italian sausage with a bit of spiciness and some of the best pizza ever....go to Rochelli's! We (my 3 boys and I) go every Friday night, it's become a family tradition. They greet everyone who walks in, and every customer is treated like they are on the "A" list!  Mark and Shelly have created an atmosphere that is rarely found in AZ. A family owned, family run with family injected values.....  Go and enjoy an oval pizza today... Tell um Paul sent ya......

I'm sad to see the changes in this place. It used to take the family and enjoy a happy hour and taco Tuesday. Now it's so loud and non family friendly I am sad... Please go back to the old Sandbar'!!!

I have edit my last review, yes was I unhappy with the owners rule to keep the patio and lounge to 21 and above, yes. But it is their choice. Please be aware that the Happy Hour only extends to that area only. I am sad that the beautiful patio area and the lower prices don't apply & can't be extended to families. Just be aware and not disappointed. Steve reached out and explained the rationale, understood but still sad!

Went to schedule a massage and the place is locked up tighter than a drum! No one answered the phone either. Looks like they are out of business

I can't even begin to tell you how refreshing it is to go to a new pizza place and find out that its not just "a pizza place"!   Tanino will cater to your wishes with a smile, a suggestion and warmth that you just don't find anymore. My teenagers love the atmosphere and we are back almost every week now... Trying everything!  The bruschetta is unreal! The eggplant pram and the ravioli are phenomenal. The closest sauce to Grandma! Keep it up guys!

Once again, they outdone themselves! They have now created smaller version of the bruschetta that allows me to order it every time!!!! Gotta try it..

This little joint is a big GEM. The fresh rolls and peanut sauce were wonderful. We had the Panang Curry and Pad Thai, both were awesome. Normally restaurants chinch on the meats but I had so much chicken breast meat it brought a smile to my face and the Pad had Shrimp and Chicken!!! In a strip center, kinda bare interior but the staff rocks and the food is off the hook!!! Do yourself a favor and try Two Sisters!!!

You gotta try, you won't want to go anywhere else. If you want great service, tacos or burritos that are monstrous, and a great happy hour come here! I like it because it's family centric yet Happy hour ALL weekend! See Tess or Ed and you won't regret it.   Stop in and let me know what you think

This place I have to three times already. I really was excited for a good Thai restaurant in the area. The food is good, don't get me wrong, but tonight the service was horrible. The lady that waited on us was more interested in sitting with a party in the back than she was being attentive to customers. I can't even begin to tell you how irritating that is... I'll give it one more time and that's it. Restaurants need to step up their game now a days, way to competitive for this nonsense!
