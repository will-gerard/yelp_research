A (pink) little gem!  We found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out based on the reviews. We have been back 4 times since! When we are in the mood to go and sit and relax and enjoy a nice Chinese meal - this is where we go.   The place is definitely dated, but it has it's charm. Its "Flamingo Palace", so of course it has to be pink. And it definitely is. It takes me back to various Chinese Restaurants we frequented as a kid in the 80's, so there's some comfy nostalgia to go with your Chinese comfort food.   Every time we go, we are greeted and seated promptly and by the same two people, a young hostess/busser and then a woman whom we believe to be the owner. Overhearing some other restaurant patrons, "she is always here".   Though the place does seem a bit dated and not much effort has been put into updates, you can tell everyone takes pride in their service and the food. We always order the potstickers, and she always politely reminds us that they are cooked to order and will take 15 minutes. We don't care, they are delicious and Zach will often keep the dipping sauce to use on the rest of his meal - it's that good.   We also always order the Flamingo Palace Special Chicken - it's also just that good. Then we get a variety of other things based on mood. We have really never been disappointed with what we have ordered, but we don't branch out that much here either. I wouldn't say this place is all that different in preparation of the common dishes, not to call it 'basic', but it definitely ranks higher in the quality and freshness category in comparison to many of their competitors here in the Valley that serve stale, old, soggy food.   (One tid-bit of constructive crticism - the dining room could use a regualr dusting and maybe even a spot-painting of the walls. It's not nasty, but I could see how many could be really put off on returning.)  We appreciate you Flamingo Palace!

I remember going to Sam's back in the day in Vegas and it was a fresh, easy fast-food spot. Yeah, not anymore - at least not this one. We walked in and the place looked like a strip-mall Chinese food place that hadn't been updated in decades and we wondered what had happened. The place was dirty. You can't see where the food is made, and maybe that was a good thing. We still ordered, and ate, cause we were too tired to stop anywhere else and hoped the food still stood up to memory. The drink station looked like it hadn't been cleaned in....a long time. Food and randoms all crusted in the corners of the containers the plastic utensils and sauce packets were in - yeah, no thanks, we will use our utensils at home. And yeah - the food was gross. Didn't seem fresh at all and just soggy. Seems like Sam's (at least this one) has seen it's Golden Years and now is just in decline. Oh well.

This is actually the worst American Eagle I have been to. The standards were fine, but only because it seems that's all they pay attention to. We felt like the associates were allergic to customers. We didn't want to mess up their denim behind the cash wrap but they didn't want to help, despite hearing us struggle and look over from 4 feet away but just kept talking to each other at the counter. I actually had to move out of one of the girls way as she squeezed by me and i was the one who had to say excuse me. Maybe she was mute, im not sure. As we walked to the fitting rooms, 2 of them walked out passed us and back to the registers to chat. We stood there waiting and finally had to walk up and ask for someone to open a door. We both made a purchase, as the whole store was 40% off but I feel like just returning it all.

So...had been curious and wanted to give it a whirl - got my ears pierced. We had circled the mall trying to find a place that had basic studs that suited out taste (not little sparklies) and after a few unlucky stops, we landed @ the Pagoda. The girl behind the counter was awesome (and I am sorry I don't remember your name!) offering education, tips, tricks and was completely a part of the experience and made it fun. I am often disappointed, sadly, with retail sales associates, and I wasn't about to have it whilst someone is putting holes in my body. Anywho - thanks.

Ok - but seriously. I know we all know IHOP for what is, what it serves, and the last time I had been to one was not memorable - I just ate there. But this one actually made me rethink my opinion. We went on a Sunday for breakfast cause it was close to the new home and well, we got a little unexpected "wow". The place was packed ( always a good sign) but we didn't have to wait too long. Our server, Brian, was super attentive and offered just 'old-school' good service. I mean, I know it's IHOP but still - you're spending money and eating their food - it's appreciated! The menu even surprised us - they have made some decent, healthier updates and it tasted as good as we hoped. Though we don't frequent chains - we will def be back and even thinking to add this location to our breakfast spot circulation.

Those 5 stars are for the Take Care Clinic inside Walgreens. This was my first time at this location, but have frequented other locations and have never been dissatisfied. The Nurse Practitioners here beat the experiences I have had in finding or going to a regular family physician (so, besides me getting plagued with respiratory infections twice a year, this is why I frequent the clinic.)   Hardly ever a wait, registration is electronic, and the Rx is right there. So much better than being processed in a Dr.'s office by 4 different people who seem to hate their job.   I feel bad as I cannot remember the Physician's name that helped me last week, but she was awesome. Like I said, they always are - they are like [Mom]. And when I say 'awesome', I mean in that she was actually sincere, gentle, inquisitive without just prescribing me expensive drugs that may or may not work first round so that i have to come back and didn't rush me through the process. I love going to the Take Care Clinics for this reason. It can be a little pricey without insurance, but I feel it is still reasonable.   Yeah, I am a sickly person and have to go a couple of times a year - but if I have to go, I go here. They have more of my records than any Doctor's office I can think of.

Pedicure virginity: TAKEN.  So we decided to get and pedicures over the weekend and I had never been. Boyfriend and his parents go all of the time together and his Dad especially loves them. I figured, I am on my feet all of the time like his dad, and my feet are pretty busted - maybe I need to give in and try it out. I have had a manicure before - not a fan. I bite my nails just fine. Ha!  We looked at a couple of places closer to home on Yelp, but they seemed more expensive with their a la carte and package deals, and Lobo is where boyfriend and his family always go so we went with the tried and true.   I was really pleased with the shop, nothing spectacular and high end, but I didn't expect that. if I was going to have a whole spa day, sure I may expect more, but this was some routine maintenance right? Perfectly suited for the need. The place was clean, chairs were comfortable, and everyone was super friendly.  We got the deluxe pedi package and added on some extras, but we had the sugar scrub with massage, lotion massage, hot stones, and a nail buff.   They were pretty busy with what seemed like a lot of regulars, that's a good sign. Every single tech i saw was either on someone's hands or feet working away.   They had a couple of TV's on with football playing (Sunday afternoon, so yeah) and that made it interesting to me - having a pedicure while watching football. Can I get a beer?  Anywho, we will drive the extra distance to come back here, I like me some Lobo!

I didn't grow up with Cracker Barrel, and I was never that familiar with it. I have now dined at a Cracker Barrel restaurant a total of 3 times: Pennsylvania, Utah and now Arizona. Though I know, as a company, they have some different views on things than I do I have always thought their food was simply good ol' homestyle cooking and I have enjoyed it. And this 3rd time was no exception. We went for Thanksgiving, as we had our family's 'traditional' Turkey Day the weekend prior for scheduling purposes.   First off, I want to say "Thank You" to those who worked on Thanksgiving Day. Whether they had the option to work or not, we appreciate you and your GREAT service.   The place was busy and we went at 11am. We had to wait a bit longer than they initially told us but we were not about to complain - we expected to wait even longer than that! It was so annoying to see people complain about lines and waits, that's why you stay home on one of the busiest days of the year then!  I had to argue with the cashier when she thanked ME for MY patience!  With that said, that's the only tough part of the restaurant's set up. You go to the cashier in the shop to pay for your dining bill, so when it's really busy, things get crowded and a bit pushy. (We wondered how many jerks have just walked out without paying!) Also, all of the people who ordered to-go meals were also trying to get in there ahead of people. The parking lot is also not set up to handle such crowds, especially for their Thanksgiving to-go meal deal - we were waiting to see some yelling matches!  But the food, spot on and tasty! I opted for Meatloaf on Turkey Day (I'm such a rebel). Meatloaf, mash, corn and mac'n'cheese - yes please! So good when you mix it together and then put it on a roll. I have to say that I wasn't a huge fan of their corn bread, I like it a little more moist and sweet, but to each their own. I don't think I could eat here every day (like my boyfriend's Dad does...seriously), but I am thinking we definitely need to come back more often!  I wish I remembered our server's name, she's a gem!

Ok, I started out my first experience at Tee Pee's thinking this review was going to be not one of my favorites to write. I don't like to complain and as we waited to be seated, I just opened myself up to this famous local gem. I mean, there's a reason it's packed and everyone talks about it, and well, as you may already know or will know upon entering the building - GW Bush ate here so...whatever that does for you. Anywho - the place feels dive-y but it has it's charm. Reminds of places I loved as a kid. But it appeared clean, so I'm good.   We waited awhile, but used the time to look at their menu on Yelp and decide so we didn't hold up the table too long. Sat, had the soggy chips too (as we saw other reviews said, and yeah, we were bummed). But chips are free, not gonna complain - we still ate em - whatever. But yeah - the food was bomb. I get it now. I had the Chicken Burrito and he had the Cheese Enchiladas. Great prices too for what you got, even the pitcher of classic margaritas that we split was only like $9 - dang. I definitely want to come back try some other dishes. We went to another local [Mexican] restaurant the following night that is favorited by locals but is [nicer] and more expensive - but hated it and wished we had just gone back to Tee Pee's (if that says anything to ya [ahem-Ticoz-ahem]).

To be honest, I had never been to or even heard of Bobby Q's - and I have lived about 2 miles away for almost a year now. However, the boyfriend and his family are fans and we decided to go eat here this last weekend for the boyfriend's birthday. This night also happened to be the same night of the "Phoenix Hurricane" so we were happy to see the power was on, but boy were they busy!  Something I have always found helpful: "Never eat at a restaurant that's not busy."  We had to wait for almost an hour for a table for 6, but we knew that going in and just waited on the patio. I don't know if they are always that busy, but it seemed the waiting area could definitely have more chairs or space for that term of wait. And if the weather happens to not be so agreeable, like that night, they could use a bit more coverage so patrons aren't getting soaked.   Anywho - onto the meat - literally. We were sat and started salivating over the menu - all sounded and looked good (I order via Yelp photos). We each ordered something different and there was a lot of sharing going on. One in our party was happy to hear they still offered the Crab Legs dinner, so take note if that's your fancy. We ordered the Rotisserie Chicken meal with (2) sides: mac and cheese and a loaded baked potato. Everything was delicious and satisfying and was plenty of food - I could have probably taken some home - and all for $13. In my opinion, this place has great prices. I expected, with the look and feel of this restaurant, to be a bit over-charged but I was pleasantly surprised.   Boyfriend ordered the Brisket meal with (2) sides, and dang that meat was tasty! We loved how it came with sauce on it, unlike a lot of these places that are serving you sauceless, dry meat and you have to add it yourself. We also asked for extra and we loved how they brought us our own 'jugs' of regular and spicy (we used up all of the spicy) sauces for the table.   I cannot remember our server's name, but she was awesome. The definition of what service should be in a busy, family style restaurant. We had a lot of requests for her and she was being asked for this and that left and right by almost every member of our table and she handled each one with patience and grace - I was impressed. And I am rarely impressed by servers lately.   If it was pouring, and half of the city's power was out, and we had to wait on the patio for an hour for a table - I would still come here and eat again. I am actually looking forward to it.   OMG those donutsssssssssssss. Make sure you get some.    That 'nightclub' they have though...

Yeah, methinks: overrated. This review has been in the works for some time now. I have been to Ticoz a number of times, and really the only reason I return is due to a friend inviting me to go to breakfast or, like the last time we were here, their birthday dinner. The first time I came here was almost 4 years ago, and the last was about a month ago for a birthday. All experiences about the same - actually, no - I'd say they have progressively gotten worse.   I know it is a popular spot, and I won't argue with someone who loves this place, but I find it a bit confused and overpriced for the quality. It's cute, I suppose, for a CenPho spot. (I may be putting down some CenPho spots that really make the effort!). But I would have to say the food and drinks here are about as tacky as the interior decorating. I cannot remember having anything I really felt was worth finishing the plate here. I had a chicken burrito last time which was pretty bland, served with some sort of BBQ/refried beans that confused my mouth and the rest of the dish. I will say, I like the little cornbread/cake scoop you get on your plate. The most memorable thing I have have eaten here.   We also ordered their flavored Sangria pitcher ($25!!!)...a huge pitcher that is really just about 3 glasses total due to the amount of ice they use in both the pitcher and the glasses, and tasted like grown-up KoolAid as if the flavor came from some sort of Pucker's additive. Actually, I remember going to Ticoz for the first time for their Martini night and I had to send back 2 of them because that's all they were, vodka and Pucker's. Gross.   This last time we were here, for the friend's birthday dinner, we had a large group and were sat in the corner booths. Seating was fine, we knew we were a large group, but we felt like we were a burden for the server and felt more processed than really served. I mean, from my experience in service, you work a large group for a tip but our server had zero personality with us and made me feel like I was on a field trip, not at a birthday party at an adult restaurant.   My last last review (for TeePee's) actually cited this experience. We dined at TeePee's Friday, and then Ticoz Saturday for the party and we both highly agreed that, though they are very different in ambiance, style, food, etc., we would much rather go and eat at TeePee's again, spend half the amount of money and enjoy ourselves.   In a time when most places are going for freshness, quality and style - I just hope things keep up for 'em. To each their own!

Man, I had such good memories of Red Robin and the food - now I don't really care to come back. We came for a quick, casual lunch on a Sunday. It was decently busy, but not packed. We were greeted by a young hostess with an attitude who just sat us at a high top in the bar right by the front door without asking if that was ok. I personally hate high tops as they can be uncomfortable for tall people. We went back to ask for a booth as we saw a few available, and she sighed and said that server needed some time before being sat again, we said we would gladly wait. Literally 5 seconds goes by and she grabs menus and told us to follow her. What just happened?  She quickly sat us and sauntered herself and her ponytail back to her perch. Jeez.   The server was nice enough but could have been a bit more attentive, but we knew she was busy. We ordered a chicken salad and a burger to split. We were really excited for the steak fries, like anyone right?! Not so much, our fries were the first thing we tried and they were cold and rubbery and as we used to call in the restaurant industry "DEAD". We asked for new ones, which we got but they almost seemed undercooked this time, but whatever. We ordered the burger medium, it was a little more on medium-well side which was okay but it was cold on the outside. We cut in half and ate it anyway, we weren't going to turn a quick lunch into a whole afternoon sending everything back. The salad was meh, nothing to take a picture of for the menu if you know what I mean. Some looked like' ABC' salad...probably due to being tossed in the dressing and sitting there awhile.We did, however, get numerous refills on our strawberry lemonade from our server which we probably shouldn't have. That drink is SO sweet and unnatural tasting that it made me crave refills on water instead.   Anywho, I don't normally expect much from family-type-chains but Red Robin used to stand above many of those in my experiences. Seems they have remodeled and restyled quite bit but, well, you come here to eat not admire light fixtures.   No thanks.

First time - won't be the last!  I like to rate businesses according to their competition, what you would expect there, or other comparable businesses. We decided to try India Palace because of the Yelp reviews (don't know how I didn't find this place sooner) and I was REALLY in the mood for some Indian food and (thankfully) my boyfriend has begun to appreciate it more and more so we decided to try a new place. I had only been to 2 or 3 other restaurants in the Valley since I moved here and I thought I had found my go-to...well, turns out, I have a new one.   We learned that this was a new location for the business, that they had moved recently from a location they had been in for years. We thought it was decent, well decorated, we were comfortable there. It was really slow and we wondered why, but whatever - better service for us eh?  And it was! Besides the food being SPOT ON - the service was so attentive, personal and friendly we not only had our tummys warmed by the culinary loving but also our spirits by just having some nice conversation with our server (whom we didn't get her name but she had just moved to Phoenix from Flagstaff where she worked for their location there which we are definitely making note to try next time we go up North!).   For our visit, we stuck with some of my usual Indian faves - Shrimp Curry (medium heat) w/ Garlic Naan and Basmati rice and then the MIXED TANDOORI GRILL (OMG, best I have had, served on a sizzling plate with vegetables and onions, tender and not dry). We had a little RICE PUDDING with some INDIAN TEA to finish which was a perfect combination.   (Sorry, I CAPITALIZE the food I had/recommend for the skim-readers.)  We cannot wait to go back and bring some other family and friends who want to try Indian food, probably try the buffet!

We are usually Harkins goers, and after this visit to AMC, we may always be Harkins goers.  First we looked up movie times as we always do on Flixster, got there, and were told that their times are never correct on Flixster, Movie Phone, any of those so it's best to only check AMC. I have never had an issue with Flixster, it's one of the largest apps for theatres, why aren't you better connected?! So we had to wait another hour for the movie.   The Concessions stand people were slow and we had to repeat multiple times what we wanted as if they were not paying attention. My friend used his AMC rewards card in order to use his points to get a popcorn, but they kid scanned his card and then still charged us full price because we were supposed to TELL him we wanted to use the points. We don't know your system, and maybe that was OUR bad, but maybe you guys should be more engaged with your guests and ask.   We walked over to the theater and people were standing outside the doors and said the cleaning crew told them to wait to enter as it was being cleaned. It was 15 minutes before the movie was scheduled to start - seriously? They said that the crew left but didn't tell them it was okay to go and sit. We walked in anyway, no one was around and the theater was still a mess.   The theater was also hot and the seats are uncomfortable, as if their reclining position is upright, and their upright position is leaning forward.   We expected better from a newer theater, and from AMC. Oh well...we will just stick to Harkins.

MY TIP: "We ordered the spicy catfish and the regular whiting...OMG the whiting!!!"  Found this place on Yelp, surprised we hadn't seen it earlier, and wanted something different. We felt like having seafood but really don't like the overpriced chain seafood restaurants (Red Lobster, Pappadeaux's) that are never as good as they show or charge.   Anyway, found this place and it had great reviews - must be good. And yeah, not disappointed. We usually order directly from Yelp photos, so we really already knew what we wanted but were surprised at how much was on the menu.   One Catfish combo  (Joe recommend spicy) and a Whiting combo (regular batter). We got various sides to share and try. I would have to say, I wasn't impressed by the sides, but they were good. Just your good ol' average comfort-food sides, but the real star was the battered fish. I love catfish - so I always order it, but I wasn't as in love this time. It was good, didn't have as much flavor for me, so maybe I will try the regular batter next time. But the whiting - I would order that again. I don't know if it was the batter or what, tasted almost like lemon pepper, that was delish! Portions were plenty - I was kind of happy my boyfriend couldn't eat all of his and I finished his Whiting (oink oink).   Overall we enjoyed our meal and we will definitely be back. The restaurant was comfortable, overall pretty clean, wasn't too crowded, there was a TV with Family Feud playing so we were all guessing along, and service was decent.   That's what I have to say about it.

First time here - and let me tell you, a whole debacle started over just that.   Upon walk-up, there was a greeter at the door who, as we reached for the door handle and pulled it ajar, asked us if we were "new here" in which we told her we were. Then she proceeded into a lengthy, very rehearsed explanation at how the inside set up was going to work, all the while other guests were approaching the entrance too - including one a-hole who just squeezed in passed us as if I was holding the door open for him and after I called him out he said "Well?! Im not new here!". I barely could pay attention to her monologue while all of these other people passed us at the door, and finally we just thanked her barely comprehending what she had just said and went in to line up. This whole set up already gave us anxiety.   Now we get to the cramped line at the door where you look at menu panels as you walk further in. To me, this isn't exactly the ideal set up as one can't see the entire menu to decide, you have to read them as you walk further in and people move out of your way. So far I am not getting the concept here. Like, I do get it, but I don't get it. It's a breakfast house, not a factory line. I don't like feeling I am being processed through a system when I go to eat.   We ordered the Meat Lovers Scramble and the gringo Burrito. We thought the prices seemed a little much for it being a quick-order-and-eat breakfast place, but it has great reviews, so...  Yeah, the Meat Lovers, not so meaty. It was scrambled eggs and bacon and ham. Now that I look back at the menu, I realize it says here sausage too, ours had no sausage. It wasn't a very large portion, and having some limp, soggy hash browns aside and then wheat toast - we were recounting trips to IHOP being more satisfied with a similar order. And for $8.29? It's not to be mean, it's just true. My boyfriend was still hungry after this so I shared some of mine.   The Gringo Burrito was really good. I would eat that again. I didn't expect much from scrambled eggs and bacon in a tortilla, but it was tasty. I feel like it needed the salsa and sour cream it came with sides of, but it was good. Realistically though, I could just make it at home. Hash browns, again, I've had a lot better (even at Denny's). That's a shame because good hash browns can save a boring breakfast dish.   We saw someone going around and asking the tables how they were doing and if and what they liked, but no one came to our table or we would have shared. Oh well, looks like a lot of people love it here so to each their own, eh?!

Worst Carl's Junior food experience ever. Fries were so cold and soggy, chicken club sandwich was chewy, cold and tasted a bit odd. I had to remove the lettuce because it was wilted and lifeless and disgusting.   Used to enjoy the food here, won't be coming back.   It's fast food, is it that hard?

Bummed over Brunch - won't be back.   To start, I have been a big fan of The Vig since I moved to Phoenix 6 years ago. Taken first dates there, spent a few birthdays, dinner with friends and many terrific brunches. Lately, we have become more choosy about where we spend our time and money, so when we had the craving for mimosas and a good brunch, we debated between a familiar favorite, The Vig, or a recent new interest, St. Francis. We had not been to The Vig in awhile and decided, Uptown it was. We wanted bottomless mimosas, ceviche to start, and then a yummy breakfast dish.   We got there a bit before Noon to find it about half full not too crazy, waited at the door for the hostess to figure out what she was doing (not kidding) and finally sat a party of five ladies before us, then us, then another couple of guys after us, all sitting pretty close in vicinity. Ladies had a server approach first, then the other guys, then us, whatever. We asked for the starters only to learn that it was now illegal to serve bottomless mimosas (boo, oh well) and that they had taken the ceviche off the menu. Whaaat?! BOTH are still on the website menu guys. Fine, we ordered mimosas and chips and guac. Mimosas came and then placed our food order and waited for the appetizer. We ended up waiting 20 minutes for the chips and guac after having to remind our server Lindsey ("oh, yeah...") about them and watching the other 2 tables who ordered the same thing get theirs shortly after ordering. Our server returned (and said "oh, they must have lost the ticket" with little empathy for their mistake. Thankssssss.  All the while, waiting for our app, we start to look around and take in the environment. I have to say, this was the strangest visit I have ever had to Uptown. We saw they had some sort of Fantasy Football league party of people on the patio, who didn't seem to be taking much of the server's attention. It wasn't a huge group, so it didn't seem to be a reason for the speed of service. Also, we noticed there was no music on, not sure if they turned it off or extremely low for the party, but geez, it was so stale and sleepy in there. It felt like you were dining in a place after-hours when they want you to leave.   After about 3 minutes of eating the chips, our food arrives. UGH. Hate that. This is why we ordered them early, not a new concept here but anyway. Server becomes back 30 seconds later and asks how the entrees are, and we tell her we haven't touched them yet as we were still wanting to enjoy the appetizer. She says, "Oh, don't stress about the chips and guac, I took it off your bill." Yeah, that's nice of you but seriously "don't stress"??? Yeah, stressed isn't quite the feeling I am experiencing right now.   He orders the Eggs Benedict (neither of us had tried it before) and I ordered the Steak & Eggs (same deal, first time).   Eggs Benedict - nothing to expand upon. Pretty basic. The Hollandaise is a spicy version and not exactly the star of the dish. Then again, there were no stars, the fact that english muffins, ham and eggs taste good together is the only thing that made the dish enjoyable.   Steak and Eggs - Sent it right back (see photo). Steak was gray. Hash browns were hash-grays. Everything just looked soggy and unappetizing. I ordered the steak medium, which is essentially was, but this flank steak was the worst looking piece of steak I have ever had put in front of me. I cut it up and the texture was all gristle and mush, took one bite and it was my last. No flavor, chewy, gross. The hash browns were one big soggy grey pancake. I am not eating this. Signaled the server and told her and she offered to have it remade - no thanks, i will just take the Eggs Benedict, I am over this brunch.   The reorder takes (of course) longer than the original order and in the meantime, it felt like the waitress is now staying away from our table. All the while, I was never rude or mean in my tone with her and you would think with as many issues as our table had been experiencing, there would have been some added attention to at least save the tip right? Keep the mimosas coming? Nope! Lindsey failed. We had to ask others who came by, one who may have been a manager and I ended up explaining that we had to send the food back, since she noticed I didn't have a plate. She then said that she agreed about the quality of the steak, it's not good, and that their "hash browns" are more like a potato pancake. But gray? Ummm, so the issue is known that the $14 Steak and Eggs aren't good and more than just myself have had an issue, yet, still on the menu.  This was the worst experience I have had at the Vig, and upon trying the Fillmore location we have had TWO pretty crappy service experiences (so we don't go anymore). Arcadia has always been the best. As of now, I wouldn't dare try Scottsdale.   I am hoping this isn't a sign of things going downhill because they have too many locations to manage.

What a joke. We went to the Casino for a group birthday party and then decided to go up and have some drinks and dance at the 'club'. We get to the door and they are charging a cover and have a strict dress code with security at the door, so we are thinking it must be worthwhile. Guys - $10, girls free - whatever, I am from Vegas and used to it. I pay the smug cashier for myself and my boy with a $20. I pass through first to proceed to Security for "dress code" (in a minute), while the all-star cashier charges boyfriend $10 - again. Nice. I didn't know until later or else there'd be no more to tell of our experience at this hole.   I am told I am not in proper dress code. Not planning on a fancy adventure at the Casino, I am wearing jeans, leather shoes, a white tee with a black hoodie. I am told I have to tuck my hood into the back, it isn't appropriate. But a hump on my shoulders from the fabric is? Whatever, it isn't like my hoodie makes me look like a hoodlum, but I play along while [Security] is getting a moment to [a] job. We go up the elevator, all hump-backed out and in need of drinks. Get up to the top and see what looks like a Conference lobby space that has been set up for a cocktail party in a Red Lion Inn. What a joke.   The bar is small, has 2 bartenders for a mass amount of people pushing their way up to the front through what is a confusing line/dance floor. Yeah - where people dance is basically the same place where people line up for drinks. You can see the DJ booth in the photo I uploaded. I am surprised they didn't have a bubble machine.   Guys walking around with hooded sweatshirts, untucked. A weird mix of people, but whatever. It was crowded so obviously some people like it - rock on. I am just not one  much for pretentious-acting, trying-to-be casino nightclubs that have shit to show for what they front downstairs. That elevator ride should have kissed me before it....

SAD. AWKWARD. DISAPPOINTING.   Sorry, I had to state my overall sentiments right off the bat.   The first time we came here, it was a Saturday morning and we wanted to try a local [gem] vs. going to IHOP. Upon walking up to the door, a little hand-written note told us that they were closed for a Wedding. Bummer - but ok.   Second time we came (two Saturday's ago), they appeared to be open though the neon "Open" sign was not illuminated. We decided to park and give it a try. Walked in and discovered they were open, and we were greeted by the TWO (and the ONLY) employees working - the cook and the waitress who both told us we could sit wherever we wanted but asked us to be patient as they were backed up and short handed. We weren't necessarily in a rush, so we sat and looked over the menu. We had read a lot of great reviews on Yelp so we wanted to try it. Sadly, we got to experience the other end of the spectrum.   I am going to cut this a bit shorter than I could.   We were in the restaurant for an hour. It was 40 minutes before we got our food. Upon arrival, there were 4 tables. Not much to get overwhelmed by, but considering they were cooking, serving, cashiering, bussing AND dishwashing for themselves - I could see why they were flustered and running VERY behind. We watched other couples and groups come in about every 5-10 minutes, at least 5 of which walked out due to not having a clean table to sit at or waiting way too long to even get a drink order taken. We saw one patient guy sitting at his table for 30 minutes before he got his food, and he was there BEFORE us so who knows how long he was waiting - for biscuits and gravy!!!  As we waited, we had a lot of time to observe. This place is like a hoarder's dream. There's decorative old do-dads everywhere, and dusty ones at that. We saw what was probably last year's Holiday decorations, last month's (or so we think) Halloween decorations, car audio speakers in the ceiling tiles yet there was no music playing (we just sat in silence listening to the poor two girls run around and the other people wonder WTF was going on), and parts of the restaurant that were falling apart. This place seriously just needs some love and attention.   It was kind of gross to see how some of the food and drinks were stored, or being served. I saw the waitress in one moment ask another patron if she could take his drink mug, only to the run in the back and wash it really quick for what I assumed was a needed reuse.   Sadly, upon talking to one of the girls working, we learned that the owner hardly comes around anymore but focuses mostly on her catering business. We were told that they are just about always shorthanded and embarrassed to work there because they are constantly having to apologize to the customers. We felt awful!  We joked around that the only thing that could make that experience better was if Gordon Ramsey walked in the door.   The food was good, and we did enjoy it, but it wasn't anything we couldn't get at IHOP really. The stuffed french toast was ok, but I could tell the strawberries were frozen as they were cold and mushy and that red-grey color that they get. My boyfriend's egg/ham/bacon plate was, well, eggs/ham/bacon. We got a side of the potatoes, I have had better frozen to be honest.   They gave us  few muffins for free to apologize and thank us for being so patient. Sorry, but those muffins were "Muffin close to the Best" - dry all around except super sticky on the top. No thanks.   Sad to say it but we won't be going back nor expect to see this place around much longer at this rate.

So, we have all gone on bad dates. But when it happens to your Moms - yeah no. And all the day before Valentine's Day. So, Mom being in Vegas and me in Phoenix, I remember this awesome lil' candy shop at Tivoli Village where Mom works, and *click*.  Called up, hopeful for some sugar-fix-assistance to have a dfelivery to Mom's office - and Arlene was awesome. I didn't expect them to be able to do it on the busiest day a candy shop may have, but she was an angel - *cherub? I dunno, but yeah, she went the whole nine and I appreciate you Arlene. Keep doing what you do and I am glad you are out there doing it. To local business!

I found Stacey on Yelp and was really excited to learn about her design and vision for her new spa. She took the frou-frou out of the spa experience. I was already excited to hear about the concept from her passionate explanation via phone, but even more so when I walked in. She set this place UP. From the decor, to the colors, smells...and the PATIO. We went and got a facial with her, and while one was being treated the other sat out on the patio and kicked back and listened to Motown. I want to copy this feel for my apartment patio. But, this is all only supportive detail to what's important here - your skin's care. Stacey knows her stuff and will find what works for you - something I am always leery about when I go to a specialist who carries a skin care line. I recommend "What a Prick", and if things get too heavy in there and you start to tingle - ask her to put her balls on your face. I know, I know...just trust me.

We LOVE this place!!!  Let me start out by saying that I base my ratings off of comparison to similar businesses or expectation. So, i wouldn't compare a restaurant like Honk Kong to a fine dining Restaurant or a PF Chang's for that matter - completely different places. I compare Hong Kong to their competition, the other delivery-take-out/dine-in local, little Chinese food restaurants.   First off this place shouldn't be judged by it's cover: in an old Taco Bell location, in a run-down strip mall, in a little-to-be-desired corner of town. Sadly, the exterior gives you the first warning, then the interior will make you question why you didn't heed the first warning, but hopefully can get passed all of that and get to the good stuff!  We are addicted to: the MONGOLIAN BEEF(tasty beef with delicious spices and LOTS of onions, mmmm), the ORANGE CHICKEN is a comfort-food-fave (not too sweet, but not too spicy), the LO MEIN is just how I like it (soft, chewy noodles and a nice balance of veg and meat), the SESAME SHRIMP is different than I have ever had and I love it (the batter is almost like pancake batter so it's sweet and puffy), the WONTON and EGG DROP soups are delish (always hot and fresh, vegetables still crisp and lots of big shrimp and meat in the wonton soup).   And we always get the "free" pork fried rice (currently a special if you $pend $o much) which doesn't seem prepared  any different than you'd expect but it's just delicious!!  The service is also always super friendly, speedy and appreciated - from the phone, to ordering in, or delivery - thank you Hong Kong! See you soooooooon.

I would agree with  the other reviewer - I wouldn't normally write a review for a quick-food chain restaurant, but...with this location literally being blocks from another location (that's closer to our home), we would MUCH rather come here!  In comparing this Subway location to many others we have been to, especially the other on Thunderbird and 19th, this one needs some recognition. The service is much more friendly, they have a little more pep in their step in making those sandos and getting through a line, and they don't skimp on toppings. Seriously!?! I don't know, I remember back in the day Subway sandwiches used to be full and healthy looking and some of these 'artists' add so little toppings it's almost insulting. "Do you think I can't handle more than 5 olive slices on my footlong?"   We have seen a few employees here that do seem to go above and beyond with the friendly and personality side of the service, and it is appreciated.   ***We just wish you guys did the text message deals like the Thunderbird & 19th location so we didn't ever have to go there again.

WOW. Worst fast food experience and worst fast food I have had in my life to-date. And I have eaten at Del Taco a few times.   I had been to Rally's a bunch growing up in San Diego, and I had decent memories until this last Sunday. Now that this location (which had looked dilapidated for some time now) was open [again?], we decided to go and check it out. Also, my boyfriend had never experienced Rally's. Realizing it was newly opened, we figured it's going to be busy but it wasn't that bad. I have seen the McDonald's down the street busier on weeknight. We waited for nearly 10 MINUTES at the drive-thru speaker just to order. After the first 6 minutes, a guy came on and asked us to give him another second and he'd be right with us. Yeah...no. I was getting really annoyed, I mean I don't mind waiting, just communicate. You have a microphone attached to your face.   When we actually interacted with the guy at the window, he was so distracted. There was even a manager there constantly at his register taking over who didn't interject or apologize or seem to be helping at all. When he went to hand us our food, he got distracted and even pulled it back, as if he messed up or forgot what he was doing, and then just sat there talking into headset, dangling our ticket-to-finally-go-home in his hands. I am like "disengage already"!   (Hindsight, I shouldn't have been so hasty to accept the order.)   We order two of the bacon crisp cheeseburger or whatevers and a medium fry (SEE PHOTOS). GROSS. These were like ABC burgers - already been chewed. I have had a better burger from an inner-city elementary school. And the fries, which they brag about being 'famous', were famously TASTELESS...and stale.   Anyway. I hated it. Hope you don't end up like me. If you do go, don't look at the pictures because that's not what you're getting.
