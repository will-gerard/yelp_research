Since getting a job, nearby, I've eaten at Tott's a handful of times. Having only 30 minutes to eat, I can walk in, order, eat, and leave with a few minutes to spare to get back to work. I highly recommend the Sesame Chicken. The food is great (big portions too), they're fast, and the owner is very personable and friendly!

I share the sentiment with a couple other Yelp users that I have a love/hate relationship with this place. Fry's is a great place to go IF you know exactly what you want and you need it now. The selection far exceeds places like Best Buy and Target and the sales can be pretty awesome. That said, take note that I said it's a great place "IF you know exactly what you want." The customer service here is worse than you'll find anywhere. On the handful of occasions that I've absolutely had to ask an employee for help, the experience was downright appalling. On one occasion, a female employee was typing away at a computer. Trying to not be intrusive, I told her that I had a quick question. She stopped typing, looked up at me, shot daggers with her eyes, looked back down at the computer, and proceeded to type. A nearby employee heard the conversation and jumped in to help (probably the most helpful anyone has been). Another time, I went on the Fry's website to see if this store had any more copies of a particular Mac software. It said they had quite a few. I called to double-check. The associate I was connected to immediately told me they were all out. After telling him the site said otherwise, he replied with "The site isn't always up-to-date."  Judging by my past experience, I decided to go to the store anyway. Sure enough, they had a whole shelf full. The one that really takes the cake is when I asked an employee in the audio department to demo a speaker for me. After fumbling with the control panel for probably ten seconds, he tells me that the DVD player doesn't work. I see a cord with a headphone output at the end of it and ask him if I could try connecting my iPhone. After telling me "it won't work but you can try," the guy actually took the opportunity of me turning my back to him to LEAVE THE ROOM. 10 minutes of fumbling around later, after CONNECTING THE SPEAKERS MYSELF, I got the demo I wanted, headed straight back home, and bought them on Amazon for $80 cheaper.

My favorite Mexican restaurant in AZ. Nice atmosphere and all the ingredients always taste fresh. Only downside is that this place gets way too crowded.

LOVE the food here. This is coming from someone who found his perfect personalized combo (jade red chicken burrito, bbq pork quesadilla) and usually orders the same thing every time. Although, I've noticed a strange pattern, whenever I end up taking a first timer here: if they end up ordering anything other than what I recommend, they usually have anywhere from a mediocre reaction to flat-out hating their meal. Emerald Chicken, ordered alone, has consistently been rated to me as tasting like "cat food." Then they taste my burrito or quesadilla and say "That's amazing! I should've ordered that!" I do think this place needs some kind of a makeover. The Phoenix location, while feeling a little run-down, at least has some personality to it and feels welcoming. Also, something has to be done about the ordering system. Sure, it's not rocket science, but it's gotta tell you something when every new customer that walks through the door looks completely dumbfounded. Despite these criticisms, I do recommend trying it out. I mean, come on! Mexican/Chinese fusion! How often do you see that around?

When someone first told me about Orient Grill, I was a little apprehensive. In my experience, "all you can eat sushi" means "bland, low quality sushi." While this wasn't the best sushi I've ever had, it was still damn good. And for $20 a pop, you can't beat it. I expected a small AYCE menu but it was actually rather large, with everything from more traditional sushi, to the more Americanized rolls. Even better, the "buy one beer, get another for a penny" deal. And it was GOOD beer too! I expected Coors or Bud Light for that price. Nope, I had two big bottles of Kirin. Also, friendly service and not too crowded for a Friday night. Definitely going back!

My wife and I have been here many times, for many different occasions, and have never been disappointed. This is also our go-to restaurant to take friends and relatives from out of town (never a bad review). Everything always tastes fresh and the burgers and steaks I've ordered have always been cooked perfectly. A relaxed, low-key atmosphere, along with a very nice and attentive wait staff. We'll be back soon, I'm sure!

Absolutely awesome food! The place is very chaotic, when it's crowded, but that only shows how popular it is. I always get the amazing carne asada burrito.

I absolutely LOVE The Grid. As a non-sports guy, it's hard to find a bar that truly speaks to me. Well, this is it. Discovered The Grid was right down the street from my house, a couple months after it opened. Old-school arcade cabinets, free emulators with just about any system you can think of, board games, pinball, graphic novels, cards against humanity, craft beer, live music, geek themed events, video games and cult films playing on the tvs ... plus it lives up to its namesake, as the bar is done up Tron-style. It's the best part of my childhood and adulthood, all wrapped into one. Also, every other Monday is Rock Band night, which is an absolute blast!  I HIGHLY recommend The Grid!
