The vegan wrap is not vegan- it is a play on their title--  the idiot manager tried to explain it- yeah I get it- it's stupid- disgusted-

I love this place for dancing; the music on Sat for Doom Disco is spot on!  The attitude is refreshing, a live and let live bunch of folks... It's a little hard to find if you haven't been there/ look for a lit up red sign in the window/ have fun and dance your ass off!

I love this place! Take your meat loving friends here and I'm sure even they will be surprised!  First time we went healthy and opted for a bowl- it was good but this time we got the Big Wac and had to leave a review!  Its gluten free and suffering free (vegan) and taste like junk food!
