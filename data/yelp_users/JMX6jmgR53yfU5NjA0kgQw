holy shit i love this hotel.   super nice, big main lobby with live music and a fire, acres of pools that include a beach and a waterslide, and amazing drinks poolside next to a bomb golf course.  this place is unreal. you just plain have to go here. the restaurants are good, but most of your day you will spend by the pool sipping on great frozen drinks while occasionally finding a small pool somewhere you didn't know existed.   make it happen.

the best part about this hotel on the mountain is just that - the fact that it is on a big ass mountain.   that and it has an ok gym, great pool, decent waterslide, and amazing hottubs that are hidden up in the rock. they have their own waterfalls which are amazing and the service/bars/restaurants there are pretty decent too. it isn't as classy as the hyatt or the boulders but it's pretty good.

Some will say "why did you give this place 5 stars: it's downtown and not super nice".   Well 1) it is the ONLY place to stay downtown. This is a classy nice hotel - which is the only thing that fits that description downtown (try the four queens and redefine ghetto). They are sinking billions into it since it's under a new owning company, and the restaurants are unbelievable along with the buffet.   2)not classy? see above, and stop being uptight. while I would prefer to stay on the strip if i went to vegas, if i had to stay downtown this would be the only place that crossed my mind.

this place needs to be leveled in favor of a hotel that is actually nice. i can't give it 1 star since there are far worse places to stay in vegas (think the hilton or anywhere downtown of Fremont Street). the place looks like a giant castle, which is retarded since vegas isn't exactly geared toward kids. the inside is gross, the rooms suck (horrible beds) and with the location on the strip, there should be a much better hotel here (it's right next to the luxor and new york new york)  basically what it comes down to is don't stay here.

this place has one of the best setups to see a race ever. and mixing drag racing with vegas has just gotta be awesome.  amazing views, and it's right next to the air force base so you have fighters flying overhead the entire time.  beer, gambling, drag racing, and flybys. america.......f*ck yeah.

If you see my review for the golden nugget and ask how on earth I could give that place 5 stars and this 4, it's a matter of surroundings. The bellagio is, i'll admit, one of the top hotels on the strip. The water show is amazing, the atmosphere is great, the spa building is UNREAL. but i had to go with 4 because if you aren't dropping buttloads of cash on staying in a super nice room and going to the spa, then this place will pass you by intentionally. because it's so nice and popular, it is always crowded as all hell, and they don't necessarily treat you super nice unless you are supernice with your credit cards.   oh, and i lost 25bucks in 1.5 minutes at the slots. booo hisss.

thus begins my vegas new years reviews.......  the venetian is my choice for third nicest hotel in all of las vegas, beat out by only the bellagio (2) and the wynn (1). any place that has gondola rides INSIDE the hotel has to be solid.   and so is the venetian.  our room had (as do all the rooms apparantly) 2 tv's, great view, and a sunken living room. a HUGE bathroom with a pornstar shower with jets shooting out of the wall, and was all around a great place.   an excellent choice for vegas hotels.

and so begin the reviews of the most ridiculous new years i have ever had.  me and a couple friends from college hit up las vegas for new years, and decided to stay in the luxor as it was the cheapest nice hotel on the strip for new years (try $415). the funny part was on the night of the first it was only 109.   when you walk in this place you are speechless. i mean it's a f**king pyramid. the inside can hold a 747 (just the lobby). the rooms are not the nicest on the strip, but to get better you will have to go to venetian, Caesars, bellagio or the wynn, since all the others are pretty much on par with this one.  but its not bad. it has a tram over to the excalibur (so so so so ghetto) and is close to everything.   i personally think the best part is the spotlight shooting straight up in the air from the top of the pyramid. that and the cheap beers they bring you while blowing lots of money at the tables (yeah i'm in debt).   a great place to stay, but there is better. then again there is faaaaaaaar worse.

i am speechless.  this place is the most amazing club i have EVER been to (and i go out a lot, in vegas as well). we chose to spend out new years here in the venetian, and it was the best decision we made all trip long.   first of all this place is SICK inside. we walked in intending to spit game on girls and just had to sit there speechless for about an hour taking it all in. they have upwards of 6 different bars around the place, all absolutly amazing. they are beautiful, well lit, well designed, and overall unbelievably choice. there are multiple different rooms, each with a unique flavor, but all with ample space.   we went and they were walking around with the best sushi/asian appetizers on the face of the planet. they had dancers in the upstairs who were hot, and in general i have never seen that many women who were that hot in one place in my life. in case you havent noticed i f**king love this place.  you can't say this place is expensive, because every place in vegas that is half decent is expensive. pure, studio 54, and light are all very very nice and are all the same price as here. we also had an open bar until 11 which was both good and bad: good since it was top shelf, but bad because we drank ourselves silly.   NOW the good part.  new years: pamela anderson was there. then usher made a surprise appearance. then so did jamie foxx. and ever seen vegas vacation? rusty was there too. in the main room, there were TWO bathtubs (beautiful ones), filled with water and rose petals on top, and 2 amazingly hot girls sitting inside them the whole night. my jaw dropped instantly. the place also had 4 dj's who were all amazing, and i would go back here in a sec (paris hilton hosted here last year).  so yes, go here, do it do it do it. it is unrivaled in las vegas nightclubs and is one of the most amazing experiences. i have ever had.

ever watch mtv and see the people going to some redik spa that has everything you could possibly want?  yeah, that's the boulders.....  words can't describe how amazing this place is on the whole. it's out in the middle of nowhere and there are dirt trails leading everywhere. your room is this amazingly choice hacienda along the path (close to everything) which is great. they have a couple of pools, but what you need to come for is the spa.  we're talking saunas, steam rooms, smoothies, a decent gym, robes, you name it. fountains everywhere, amazing deco on the inside. just unreal.   very expensive. but very worth it.

Fontana Bar is one classy classy place. If you have ever been in Vegas you know the bellagio is one of the most, if not the most classy/nice/upscale place around.   And fontana bar lives up to the rep.  It is located right in the center overlooking the water that is in front of the hotel. And if you have ever seen Oceans Eleven: imagine the last scene of the movie, only sipping on cocktails, sitting in an amazingly confortable leather chair, and watching a different show on the water ever 15 minutes with live music in the bar. And throw in a cigar while you are at it. (they serve cigars to your table in these redik silver cigar holders - so so sick)  If you go, try to see a band called Isis. They are off the hook. And the lead singer not only can sing great, but is smokin hot too. By far the best place to relax in vegas.

next stop: scottsdale. you may think that I rate too many 5-star ratings, but if they deserve them, then I'm not holding back.  jaw-dropping hotel. I mean this place is huge, but in a really really nice way. any place with towel-covered beds next to the pool is fine by me. and the pool area here is amazing.   they throw this mtv spring break sunday all day pool party every sunday with a DJ and an over-21 rule. the rooms are solid (could use better TV's).   I really liked the outdoor mister-covered bar. what better place to sit and watch HDTV at night, but at the fairmont in the middle of the arizona desert.

ok this place absolutely sucks.   we got general admission tickets for this place for new years (see my next review) and immediately upgraded them since the inside of this club was horrible. it's one big crappy warehouse, with the bouncers directing you to either the floor or the upstairs (not your call, but theirs)  the bars are impossible to get to, the dance floor is really only accessible from one side, and the place is grimy on the whole.   I am not sure what I expected from a night club in a mediocre hotel (see: luxor) but I will never come back to this club.

In general, downtown Las Vegas sucks. The strip is great, but the fremont experience just isn't that cool.   However there is 1 hotel which isn't a complete dump, and that is the golden nugget. So naturally the night club is pretty decent as well.  Gold Diggers doesn't offer up the same swank/attractions of clubs on teh strip like tryst or tao, but for downtown it's great. They make mean drinks, and the dancers are smokin hot. And how can you not love the fact there is an outside patio overlooking fremont.

just. wow.  I would love to upload a picture, but there are no pictures allowed, thus I have no history of me actually being there. but....  LAX (the club this is attached to) is absolutely dismal. but this place is absolutely unreal. by far the nicest bar/lounge/club I have ever been in. the deco is truly 5 star, the staff was hella nice (thank you anne for the new years eve service) and they really treat you like you are a celebrity (which in our case, we were sitting 3 tables away from paris hilton) .  you pretty much have to get a table here, which pretty much means you are dropping a couple thousand, but I would do it again in a second. this place is a must-go in vegas, and I would tell anyone (who I liked) to check this place out.

besides being the set for a ricky martin music video (or christina agulera, not sure) this place is SICK. you must hit up the wetbar in the pool, which is right next to one of the best waterslides in a private hotel in phoenix.  this place is classy classy, and your bill will show it, but it is just all around a great hotel.
