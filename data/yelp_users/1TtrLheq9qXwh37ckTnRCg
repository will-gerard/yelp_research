Wonderful tour and so much fun!   We went on the tour with our homeschooling group.  The price was 5.00 per person and we had approximately and hour tour.   The kids had a great time.  My fifth grader really focused in on a lot of the facts that the tour guide was saying.  I was happily surprised to see how healthy and happy the cows are. I don't think you can miss on this field trip.

This is in regards to the Old Navy store.  The store was a wreck.  Clothes out of place, priced incorrectly, and the sales people were nasty!  We traveled down from up north to do a little shopping and only walked out with a few things.  I can't get over how unbelievably rude the staff was....

Delicious!  The staff was great.  They brought our food to our table and cleaned up!  Love the food!
