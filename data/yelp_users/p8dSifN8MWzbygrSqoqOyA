OK, unless you've been in a coma for 40 years you know everything there is to know about Subway.  That being said, each franchise/location can differ greatly in service and quality.  This particular location offers fantastic service, and has such long-tenured employees they have to have a PHD in sandwhich artistry.  If you could get above a PHD they would have this distinction.  I swear the same guy who was working here when I moved to the Valley 4 yrs ago is still here.  AND, right now (2/08/11) is $5 for any foot long.  Booyaa!

To quote fellow Yelper Andres D: "trips to this starbucks are always an adventure.  I guess at least they keep me guessing... how will we mess up next time?"  That pretty much hits the nail on the head.  Whether driving though or walking in expect the simple to be complicated and things to get interesting in a very annoying way.  The only time I drove through the lady taking my order repeated it back to me incorrectly 3 times (and this was coffee, not one of their more complex concoctions--yet she kept thinking I wanted a skinny latte?) and when she gathered there was some annoyance on my end she said "well sorry, but I'm multi-tasking here".    This was just one of many interesting trips, as I've been here dozens of times as it's so close to my house.  They constantly forget about the food portion of the order, forget a drink, and have some employees that aren't that nice....or sharp.  We keep hoping the staff will turn over, or something will change--yet they continue to be consistently inconsistent.  Another annoyance management should take up with the property manager is the sprinklers--which come on around 7 - 8 am every morning leaving the patio, walkway, and tables soaked.  If you feel like sitting outside you're going to have to wipe things down yourself.  I contrast this experience to the location by my office which probably does at least 3 times the volume, but never screws up, knows my name, and when I was a daily customer would have my drink ready before I even got to the register.  Needless to say, I am exploring other options for my caffeine fix.....

Acura dealership told me I needed new rear brakes at my next oil change.  Whitey's said I have 30% left and no worries for awhile (10k miles after my visit to Acura who said I had 10% left).  Great to have an honest auto shop in my hood that can work on all types cars!

There's a reason Oregano's has an hour wait on a regular Monday night:  awesomeness.  Luckily, it's almost never as long of wait as they say, and you can always relax and enjoy a beer or cocktail while you wait.  Our last visit was a party of 4, and we only waited long enough to have a single round before being seated (which is not long!).  Oreganos is just a fantastic overall value, and I've always had great service and food.  They've done whatever it takes to achieve the magic formula of restaurant success, and maintained this over a number of years.    Parking can be a bit interesting for this location, and if you don't want to wait I recommend arriving outside the 5 - 8pm dinner rush.  The only other advice I have is the cookie Pizza is worth saving some room for!

OK, I'm going to admit living in the 'Dale I have no reference for good Mexican food as I'm not sure it exists there.  However the experience and food at Tia Rosa has been so gut-bustingly fantastic I have to give this place a fiver!  The Tia Rosa style fajitas with carne asada is amazing, tender, and has a ridiculous amount of flavor.  It's not a traditional carne but fantastic nonetheless.  I can't bring myself to order anything else, but apparently there are other menu options as well.  The chips and salsa is fuh-ree and includes the verde, regular, and hot stuff upon request--I recommend you make that request.  The only two negatives--one of which would normally be a -1 star--are a lack of beer on tap and no hot sauce available!  I can grudgingly live with the beer issue, and I've solved the hot sauce problem by bringing my own Cholula.  I'm not sure if the Little Lady was entertained or embarassed.  Anyways, keep in mind it's BYOHS and get out to RDTR for some fantastic Mexican food.

*Caveat: lunch review!  This place is so fancy the Diet Coke comes in little glass bottles.  I think the poor waiter brought me about 5 of them over the lunch.  I sure hope they recycle--if not I'm going back and dropping this to 3 stars.  Great place for a business lunch with a wide selection of salads, sandwiches, and burgers.  You could of course go all out on the steak, but this has always seemed a bit heavy for me over lunch and I'm basically T-Rex when it comes to steak.  I had the lobster and crab burger and it was excellent.  Impeccable service and attention to detail, would definitely do lunch again.  Quiet enough to talk without raising your voice.  Not sure if it would be worth a dinner trip, as there is nothing unique here--typical formula for a steak house that you can find all over the Valley/US of A/World.  If you're in the area though it's a nice place with a menu that will please most diners.

Yes, Maggiano's is a chain, and yes it's a big-box Italian restaurant in a town with quite a few mom-and-pop Italian joints--but my-oh-my can they cook some great Italian food!  Being based out of Chicago certainly doesn't hurt.  Little lady and I had a great family style dinner here when my folks were in town, and absolutely everything was fantastic.  I'm pretty sure I came within a couple bites eating myself to death (think Monty Python's The Meaning of Life).  For weekend dining, I highly recommend reservations and request a booth which will put you above and away from the main floor (I do feel they pack a few too many tables in the available space).  This made the meal all the more enjoyable.  Make sure to leave a day open for digestion!

Ohhh D'Vine, I would sure like to give you at least 3 stars but I can't.  The quality of the food (that evenutally came) and the wine (for which we were charged twice) just cannot overcome the awful service I received.  I hope my experience was out of the norm, but having only dined there once I'm going to Yelp it like I see it.  We sat there (we being Little Lady and her folks) for at least 20 minutes without the table even being approached, let alone anyone taking a drink request.  I had to go to the bar to get water!  I have to say that was a first--I'm just thankful there was a bar available.  I believe it was at this point the bartender alerted a server to perhaps....serve us?!  After someone noticed we weren't invisible (phew, thought I might be starring in the Sixth Sense), things did improve--but it still took several requests to get an additional place setting.  The food was good, but my annoyance level had reached a level that I would hardly enjoy manna from heaven, or whatever that nonsense the kids ate from Narnia (Turkish Delight?).  Despite this, most places deserve a second chance--and I would give one to D'Vine if meeting people again.  However, I certainly wouldn't wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again.

Yes, there is a party in my mouth...a breakfast party!  Definitely one of the best breakfasts I ever had.  I enjoyed the arugula salad with hash browns, eggs, and bacon (all in the salad, not separate).  It might sound weird but was fantastic!  The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the abysmal parking/drive-thru situation.  Words that best describe the situation I cannot use on Yelp....so I'll just say I had to make a 500 point turn to get out of the lot, and those in the drive-thru line were none too helpful in letting me depart.  I will definitely keep this in mind on my next trip--or buy a smart car.  Patio is dog-friendly, food is fresh and fantastic.  Just don't park in the back--and enjoy D'lish!

"Yeah I grunt when I get my swell on at the gym--that's so everyone can see how jacked and tan I am!"  I've been a member for 3 yrs, and I have to say both both the facility and its members are no-nonsense for the most part.  I work out at peak times during the week, but rarely wait long (if at all) for equipment.  If you're looking for a pool, b-ball courts, sauna, steam room, or even towel service--you are at the wrong gym my friend!  However, if you're looking for an impressive selection of free weights, ridiculously cheap rates, and never having to wait for cardio equipment I highly recommend it.  About the only thing that irks me is pretty much all the treadmills vibrate like crazy b/c they need to adjust the feet so the damn things lie flat.  I swear, if I get the wrong one I sound like bigfoot.  For those with Scottsdale phobias--particularly N Scottsdale--take comfort that most of the crowd that's looking to see-and-be-seen is working out either at Lifetime, DC Ranch, or Gainey Ranch.  I would guess median age here is around 35+ and almost everyone shows up to take care of business.

Three-hundred-fifty pennies...during HH...for the best margaritas in town...equals four stars!  The chips and salsa were so-so (but gratis thankfully) and the carne asada tacos were very good.  Little Lady had the vegetarian tacos (zuchinni, yuck!) which she enjoyed (did I mention they were filled with zuchinni? yuck!).  We didn't have full dinner service as this was just an afternoon pit stop, but I would love to return.  The patio is nice and tucked away on the side, and we had a great afternoon snack and cocktail.  If I can find a couple solid go-to dishes, this place promises to be my go-to Mexican spot in the 'dale--and the 'dale needs some good Mexican food desperately!

Bomb-ba-ba-bomb-beros!  Bomberos is a place that's effortlessly cool and a surprising gem in the area.  For those that haven't been it's an old firehouse and the architecture and design is fantastic.  There's a large outdoor patio, as well as a fair amount of space inside.  Outside of some cheese/olive/meat trays, the menu basically breaks down to panini or bruschetta--with many of the same combinations.  I had both and my panini was a Spanish chorizo and was quite good.  Service was excellent, and wine selection is all South American.  If I had a complaint, I would say their price points are a bit high (at least by the glass).  Yes, I know they have to ship it ALL the way from another continent, but I'm pretty sure S American wine is relatively inexpensive from what I've bought.  Anyways, Bomberos is a great place to relax and enjoy some wine and company.  I was there on a Thursday with my aunt in from Seattle (which is a pretty cool city from what I remember) and she thought it was cool.  So yes, Bomberos is a cool place.  Check it out.

A trip to Geisha A Go-Go = a cab-cab ride home.  I just love this place, and it's quickly becoming a favorite spot for heading out with the Little Lady, meeting friends for HH, late evening, late night, anytime!  HH specials are fantastic, and the food is very good (this isn't a premium sushi joint...but very respectable sushi for a bar).  Geisha is just a really cool spot, that does a lot of different things well...and it all works out somehow.  It's a bar, a restaurant, a club, and a karaoke spot.  Constant good vibe and great service.  I've only had the bad judgement to bring my tone-deaf-no-talent self into a karaoke room once, and I promise you there is not enough sake in this place for that to happen again!

Hmmmm, this place sure reminds me of True Food Kitchen....why is that?  Could there be some common denominator?  I guess it is different in that it's smaller...and the food is actually good!  Anyways, nothing about the menu would lead me to believe it's an Italian restaurant but I primarily dine here for lunch and maybe they switch to heartier fare for dinner service.  I've had the flank steak 3 times straight which used to come with Kale (excellent) but was recently switched to an arugula and baby beet salad (why did they have to die so young?!) which is even better.  The place has a nice vibe, is adjacent to BarNorth and everything else Kierland has to offer but it is almost always LOUD.  My only other issue is the small tables and tight seating arrangements.  Don't expect a whole lot of privacy if it's busy b/c the other patrons might as well be on your lap.  Overall though, North is a cool place, good food, good service, and if you order an Arnold Palmer you get the lemonade in a nice little carafe--stay classy North...stay classy.

Just ate lunch at Eddie's House last week--and I'm not sure the place should be open for lunch, it was empty!  However, I'm glad it was as we had great service (never guaranteed no matter how busy or not busy) and a great meal.  Meatloaf is generally an annual event for me, so I took care of it early in 2011.  Excellent choice though, and I have to say if it wasn't the best meatloaf I've ever had it sure was close.  I inhaled it so fast I don't think I can even describe it, but it was the perfect lunch portion to prevent an afternoon food coma (AKA I could have eaten two orders).  Looking forward to dinner here soon (pending a vegetarian check by the Little Lady of course!).  If you're in OT for lunch, skip that nonsense at Fashion Square and give Eddie's a whirl.  Please....I need them to stay open so I can head back for more meatloaf!

DD is a great HH spot in Old Town, especially when you're looking something a little more hearty or quality to eat (ahem, Bungalow, Salty's, Loco and other mediocre to poor food offenders).  DD's rating is a huge beneficiary of my love for fantastic beer on tap, and offers up 5 great microbrews....including an IPA *drooling*.  The food is good to very good, and the only complaint I have is pretzel dough on a hamburger is just way too heavy!  The burger itself is fantastic.  On my first trip, they were woefully understaffed which = bad service and angry Little Lady, but my last visit was much better and our server was cheerful, attentive, and split the check 300 ways as we had a large party.  Any server that can smile while trying to handle that math deserves a hefty tip.  The patio sits right on Scottsdale Rd (as do most establishments adjacent to the road) but it's not too noisy.  HH goes until 8, and with an eclectic mix of cocktails, beer, and wine, there is something for everyone.  Looking forward to breakfast at the Dose!

Despite having about as many restaurants per capita as is physically possible, Old Town offers up a pretty meager selection of wine bars (and good Mexican food but that's a topic for another time!).  Luckily, 5th and Wine has upped the ante since taking over from Fine's Cellar and is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots:  The good:  -Perfect for just drinks, appetizers, full meal, large group, date night, etc. -Fantastic bruschetta and appetizers pair well with the vino -Good wine selection and price points -Fantastic HH specials with $5 glasses and $20 bottles -Excellent service -Live music on the weekends, nice patio  The bad:  -Appetizers are definitely their forte, entrees have been hit and miss -I had a prime rib bbq sandwich that had more salt in it than the Dead Sea...and I eat salt like it's a part time job.  They were very nice about replacing it with something else though and at no charge.  Overall a solid 4 and I'll definitely be back.

I won't spend too much time on this review because I don't particularly want to relive my evening again, but I can say this was my second and last trip to Iruna.  Tomato bread had no tomatoes, calamari was soggy and had no flavor (had to ask for salt and lemon), and HH specials were not offered (only available at the bar/patio--despite not saying that anywhere on the menu or website).  I'll give them credit for a solid snapper dish (at $5 a bite), and the server did recommend a nice tempranillo (although 2nd on his list behind the $15/glass of course).  The place was pretty empty until 9:00 on a Friday, and the menu is fairly limited and pricey for what you get.  Some may enjoy this place, and although there was nothing traumatic about my dining experience Iruna is just a "miss" for me.

Sorry yummy yummy, I'm hoping what I ate stays in my tummy.  We had food delivered (which was free of charge--nice!) and it arrived close to when promised.  It was almost cold, which seemed a little odd for a quick delivery from 3 miles away.  Other than being cold the food looked really good, but the Little Lady immediately noticed the cashews she had paid an extra $2 for were not included in her meal.  Boo.  Then I had my first bite of General Tso's chicken...and it tasted like battered packing peanuts!  Holy great wall it was bad, worst Generals chicken I ever had.  No flavor whatsoever.  I was starving so I doused it in hot sauce and soy sauce (don't even try the duck sauce--not sure of it's composition but not good) and scarfed some down and tossed the rest.  And now I sit here waiting, wishing, and hoping my iron stomach comes through and I avoid any double dragon action over the next 12 hours.  Wish me luck.

Bullet point review....and GO!  -Two older homes modified, with one as the restaurant (Bliss) and the other as the bar (guess!)  -Fomerly "Fade" from my understanding, but I never dined there and have no reference for comparison  -Architecture and design is very cool, melding old and new  -Service was excellent, food decent.  Good beer on tap (good beer on tap is always worth at least half a star!)  -Diverse crowd and a cool vibe.  Nice changeup from the 'dale.  -Make sure to add it to your list for and light rail pub crawl on Central as it's worth walking a few blocks!  ...and DONE!

I attended the Yelp mixer here courtesy of the elite Little Lady, so although I didn't have full dinner service I did like what I saw.  I think the place could best be described as the owner put it:  a "modern tavern."  Pros:  -They have Guinness on tap and pour it CORRECTLY.  A definite rarity in AZ. -Nice menu options and really reasonable price points. -Great patio that doesn't sit on a busy street -I friggin' love the concrete floors, need to find out who refinished them so they can do my house!  Cons:  -TBD, none yet  I can't wait to have a full dinner service here, from what I saw they've put a lot of effort into the place--from menu and drinks to decor and service.  Maybe an actual long-term winner in Old Town???

I hate to beat up a place too much, as we ate there just days after opening and there's always kinks to work out with the menu and service.  I will say the server was nice and they tried really hard.  They also had about 5 hostesses on staff so there was no wait to be seated.  However--and this is a big however--the food was awful.  Awful as in the worst meal I've had dining out in years.  In addition to the tempura fried pickles missing the mark (batter was just odd), the Stella tap clearly being hooked up to the Bud Light keg (my palate isn't that refined but I can tell BL from SA) everything was not just "meh" but cooked in a way you would cook food for your worst enemy.  The baked beans were worse than the cheapest canned beans you could buy, the mashed potatoes LL ordered made instant potatoes desireable, and the mac n' cheese made me long for Kraft.  Believe it or not, with all this being bad--it's not the worse!  First, the HH specials are probably the weakest I've ever seen...why even have them?  The ONLY specials are domestic draws.  That's it.  Nothing off the $11 martinis.  Nothing off import drafts.  REALLY???  My last gripe is the entree, advertised as "prawns" with andouille sausage.  Not prawns.  Regular friggin' shrimp.  Maybe 5 total.   Drowned in oil.  On a stick.  $2 worth of food for $20.  Oh, and BTW the whole "concept" is everything goes on a stick (even the sandwiches).  And the whole focus point of the decor is some cheesy fire "screensaver" projected on a wall.  So in closing...I guess I was hard on the place.  But the server was nice.  If it's around next year the owner has some deep pockets.  You expect hiccups with a new place, but build-out on this took several months which is more than enough time to put together a menu.  Enough, I don't want to relive the meal!
