Go Suns!  US Airways has always been a fantastic venue. I have seen concerts and Suns games here. On my most recent visit I attended the Suns/76ers game.On this particular trip the tickets we had enabled us to eat/drink in Blue Moon Lounge which was fun.  It really doesn't matter where you sit as there are a lot of choices for concessions and  the seats are comfortable. Considering the crowd size there is never an overwhelming wait for the ladies room. As others have mentioned, there is no shortage of night life downtown after a game or concert at US airways.

This is an awesome venue for live blues/music.  The service is outstanding (both the cocktail servers and bartenders)and I have a ton of fun every time I go. A very cool little club and it is totally nice that it is right here in Phoenix. The names/level of talent this place draws is pretty amazing. We saw Muddy Waters' son play a set last night. Any music lover should check this place out!

4 1/2 stars actually...  I really enjoyed Rokerij. Our server David was fantastic, and even though we were seated at the bar for dinner, the level of attentiveness was super. Knowing that we had never eaten at Rokerij, David took the time to explain the menu in detail and made recommendations.  Rokerij has quite the wine and beer list, however I opted for one of the specialty cocktails listed on the board. It was a double berry martini. I guess I was thinking double berry meant double the berries but it actually meant double vodka (I am a rookie, what can I say?)and was far too strong for a girl who likes her alcohol embedded in a concoction that tastes yummy. David must have seen I was struggling to drink this so he very kindly got a tall glass with ice and added some lemonade and then poured my "vodka surprise" on in. Yay! It was much more suitable and I was able to enjoy. :)  I ordered a sirloin steak with roasted corn and their signature potato baked into a green chile. The potato was cold but it tasted good and definitely had a kick. My friend ordered the enchiladas (one steak, one chicken, one shrimp) and loved their dish.  I would definitely go back and try out some of their other dishes, There was so much that looked and sounded good. Sitting at the bar, we could see the food being prepared and everything that came out looked delicious. The portions are very generous at Rokerij. We will be back soon!

I love Tutti Santi on 16th St! The service is always top-notch. The setting is authentic Italian. It is the one place in town where I can get orange roughy-my favorite fish. It is prepared in the most divine lemon/caper sauce with artichoke hearts-truly spectacular. I love the flaming Sambuca at the end of the meal.

Was a little reluctant to try Jiffy Lube as opposed to my auto dealer for a basic oil change. I was afraid of the upselling etc. Since I was  overdue on this and hadn't made an appointment anywhere else I decided the (possible) expense of a burned out engine outweighed the annoyance of a "shark" telling me there were multiple things wrong with my car. It turns out they were straightforward, friendly, efficient and I just needed an oil change. I was in and out and on the road.

I had some items I needed copied for first week of school that were not something I felt I could do on my own because of irregular sizing etc. I went full service and it was quick and painless and I was in and out in under 10 minutes. Awesome that this location is open on Sundays.

I agree with a prevous poster who says this Rubios is the best in the area. The employees are super friendly and nice. Between my kids and myself, we usually make tons of modifications:( hold this, add that etc.)...I always order the chipotle ranch chicken salad (minus chicken and cheese w/ dressing on the side)..they always take my order without batting an eyelash and ALWAYS get it right..my salad is always crisp and fresh and we probably take out from Rubios 3 times a month...

Dr. Weinacker is unbelievable with my dogs. He is such a fantastic vet and very knowledgeable. My current dogs LOVE him.  I had a dog who had neurological problems and he dealt with her very compassionately and gave amazing referrals and recommendations. I ended up having to put her down as a 4 year old back in 2005 as her condition was deteriorating and the staff couldn't have been kinder about letting me stay in the room with her afterwards for as long as I needed. I was sobbing like a baby of course but the entire staff was so kind and comforting.

We love Roys. The service is usually outstanding and the food is wonderful.The ambience is nice and usually pretty hopping on a Saturday.  My water glass is constantly being refilled because the people Roy's employ are totally on the ball. We have dined here 8+ times over the past 2 years and have never had a mediocre meal. They also have a delicious vegetarian menu if you ask your server. The wine list is comprehensive and they are known for their creative cocktails.We have dined here on both special occasions and regular Saturday nights. It is kind of like being on vacation when we go since it is located in the gorgeous JW Marriott. ...definitely in my top three Phoenix area restaurants.

I was overjoyed to find this place.I was stuck in a day long training and was looking for something to eat during my lunch break. Sweet! This place is so friendly and has such  nice vibe. The people who work here, (the owners?) were so nice and they seemed to have a lot of "regulars" from what I observed. I don't eat bagels very often, but, I was in definite need of some comfort food after a long morning and the anticipation  of a long afternoon. I ordered an egg and cheddar cheese bagel sandwich on a sesame bagel (I was jazzed I could get the breakfast sandwich at lunchtime) with a garden salad to go. When I got into my car I took a bite of my bagel sandwich........yum!! It was perfect and the best part of my day! I will be back!

This is the Starbucks closest to my work. I am here EARLY in the morning. The baristas know my drink. I barely have to speak which is good because my brain hasn't fully woken up yet. Great location...no drive-through but not a problem walking in as I am there at a time when there is rarely a huge line.

Add locally grown fresh ingredients with vegetarian options add a dash of creative flair with an awesome wine selection and what do you get? A restaurant worth returning to.  My boyfriend and I both enjoyed our dinners immensely. We both chose salads to start the meal. It was difficult to make a selection because all of the salad choices had interesting components. My dining companion settled on the Summer Butternut Squash salad-triple yum. I chose the Watermelon salad which was outstanding. This colorful salad had watermelon, avocado, olives, greens and they listed feta as the cheese but it tasted like blue cheese (which was fine with me..)  For our entrees, I chose the Roasted Vegetable plate. I have had a variation of this at other restaurants but this was hands-down the most delicious and colorful of veggie plates.  I also ordered a side of sauteed shishito peppers for some extra spice! My bf ordered the quail which was excellent.  The decor as others have mentioned is cowboy/AZ and it isn't a ''romantic" restaurant  per se but nonetheless it works as the focal point is the food and we will definitely be back!

Oh yes, Durant's!  We have been coming to Durant's for dinner the last 4 or 5 years. Usually when we dine there it is on a Saturday night and it is usually fairly busy. I can honestly say not only have I had fantastic meals here, but, the service is always spot on. The decor is old school which I love. You really feel like you stepped back in time with the red booths and traditionally dressed waiters. I love walking through the kitchen to get to the maitre d. It is one of the few places in town where I love dressing up to dine out, as the atmosphere is totally conducive to that. (No worries if you want to go casual -it is my own personal preference when I dine at Durant's-something about the atmosphere makes me want to wear a dress.) :)  I love their shrimp cocktail. It is fantastic. I am not even a steak eater anymore-I realize that is what they are known for but I love Durant's none-the-less. Their fish dishes are really good.  I love their crudites when you are seated-there is something magical about their ranch dressing.  I need to mention the bussers. I drink A LOT of water. Those guys and gals hustle-they are top notch. My water glass is never empty long and I appreciate that.    Nice wine list, and their wines are reasonably priced.

Our car's driver side window was smashed as we sadly observed when we finally made our way out of this restaurant (hours later)on this less than stellar evening..we spent yet more time cleaning glass off of the seats just to FINALLY get to drive away from the Ghetto cafe..er Barrio cafe...but I digress..  I don't know.... I guess a place that consistently has between an hour and 2 hour wait on a Saturday and doesn't take reservations has got to be beyond fabulous and worth waiting for right? You think? Wow..I am actually embarrased I fell for this. This must be what the people who bought Charlie Sheen tickets felt like...  Sucker! That is what I felt like last night for sure. First off, we had swung by here a couple of different Saturdays but (smartly) decided the wait wasn't worth it...my bf really wanted to try it ( be careful what you wish for)..so we got there (early for us) around 6:45 pm last night to put our name down and do the CRAZY hour and 30 minute waiting game...did I mention the bar area and patio are tiny and you get the added experience of being packed in like cows in an unorganic dairy farm....  Ok..so the food portion of the review...two words...mediocre and overrated...the guacamole was salty...i didn't get to see it prepared tableside because the restaurant was so crowded and small the server (who gets 4 personal stars because she was sweet)...literally couldn't fit the preparation cart anywhere near our table...our main dishes...were just ok.....nothing tasted particulary fantastic and the dining room felt hot with no air circulation...thank goodness for the wine....  This is probably one of the loudest restaurants I have ever been to...I was thinking no way will I be returning..that idea was more than cemented when we saw the glass damage...wtf? Maybe if you took reservations Barrio.. and had a decent parking situation..people wouldn't be sans their car for 3 hours just to eat dinner in the hood.

This is one of our go-to Mexican places. They have a surprisingly extensive menu with a lot of vegetarian options and of course the classics. Their chips and salsa are muy delicioso and their margaritas are yummy. The servers are always consistently great. The only thing I don't like is their guacamole...it's creamy almost like a dip and not my guac style.

Four of us came here Saturday late afternoon to enjoy the downstairs patio and the steel drums. We had a great time and the weather was fantastic. Our server, Ben, took great care of us. This was my second time visiting Tommy Bahamas. On a previous visit I had a cocktail (Grapefruit basil which was fantastic!) and dinner upstairs which is also a very cool bar and the dinner was great. A lot of seafood dishes on their menu which I LOVE.  Dining upstairs is a totally different experience than downstairs and I highly recommend trying both! It is fun to mix it up!  On this particular visit I was in a vodka mood so I just stuck with vodka/cranberry with lots of lime.(so much for mixing it up-ha) :) Our table decided to do appetizers and dessert as opposed to a full dinner which was perfect. We had a couple of orders of the Ahi poke which was wonderful, the pork quesadillas, (not my fave..the sauce was sticky/syrupy), and the lollipop jerk chicken which had an awesome kick and was super delicious. It was definitely super spicy but in a flavorful non obnoxious way.  Ok now to review my favorite dessert maybe EVER! I tried the pineapple creme brulee..I am a total creme brulee girl...not as much a pineapple girl but it just looked really cool and sounded good. I was not disappointed. The creme brulee was creamy deliciousness and the pineapple was light and not overpowering at all...so yeah!   I love a nice patio as it always makes me feel like I am on vacation and Tommy Bahama's patio fit the bill.

I can't believe this place wasn't on my radar before. My boyfriend and I ate there last night and I have no reservations about giving Sierra Bonita a 5 star rating. Great food-check;Great service-check;Great ambience-check; Great margaritas-check; and Great value-check!  I am a quasi (ha ha..will eat fish on occasion..) vegetarian and my boyfriend is not- so I can sometimes be a pain in the butt to dine with. I had previewed the menu online so I knew there would be some good veggie options for me and for my boyfriend it was a no-brainer-saw that there would be plenty of choices for him.  We both ordered the House Fresh Squeezed Margaritas which were really good, not to mention they came in a surprisingly big glass.  I ordered the Simple Salad (which my bf pointed out wasn't simple)-loaded w/ veggies and topped with roasted anaheim peppers and the Vegetable Tacos which had grilled portabellos, calabicitas, and onion on corn tortillas. The vegetables were perfectly grilled and so fresh-very perfect. (There is nothing worse than overcooked veggies-so I was stoked!) Both items I ordered were great and would order again.  My boyfriend ordered the Carne Asado Tacos which he really loved and the Green Chile Pozole which he also thought was fantastic. (His mom use to make Pozole growing up so he was a hard-sell, and this soup surpassed his expectations.)  One other thing I would like to mention, my order had come out incorrectly as I had asked for the Pesto Mayo that comes with the Veg tacos on the side. They had the mayo on the tacos... Instead of the customary eyeroll both the busser and the server were extremely gracious and apologetic and got the order out quickly.   Wonderful dining experience and we will be back soon!

Have been back a few times since this post and this restaurant is still one of my faves...I got to experience their brunch menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago...and...wow! My veggie omelette was delicious as was my boyfriend's meal-the breakfast enchiladas..we split a glass of wine because I believe brunch isn't brunch without a little alchohol and it was a generous pour/split...keep doin' yo thing Sierra Bonita!

I do like Rosie's and thank god they got some decent bartenders in there on Saturday night now. The two beeyotches who worked there forever and never cracked a smile needed to go! Much better! The waitresses are always sweet. Some great bands (like RIG) play at Rosie's. The crowd is usually pretty friendly....it is everything you would expect from a neighborhood Irish pub...

*****Coyote Alert!!****I love the Draw for hiking, particulary the Voaz loop up above Christianson trail. it is very beautiful up there and it is such a nice place to forget you are in the middle of the city. In fact be prepared to encounter wildlife. I saw a rattlesnake on Thursday and then a coyote approached my dog 3 times on Friday, and by approached I mean ran right up to him. I thought it was a brown dog off-leash at first. (my dog is close to 40 lbs-a Wheaten terrier)  I had to stomp my feet and yell for the coyote  to scamper away. I even had to toss some rocks in its direction. He definitely was stalking us. The coyote was not afraid of me at all but very interested in my dog. I was very lucky that my dog did not get bitten-close call!! If you have a small/medium dog-definitely take precautions. I found out that it is coyote pup season so they are particularly aggressive.  Anyway, the coyote scare aside,  Dreamy Draw is a great place to hike the many trails as well as mountain bike.

I could probably get my elite status revoked for saying this...but it dawned on me that as much as I've eaten here over the years I have never reviewed Valle Luna. Valle Luna is one of those places you just kind of take for granted. Like a sweet guy who maybe isn't exactly your type and is in the friend zone and  is always around until he disappears and then you are like "Where'd you go?". My analogy isn't the best,,,but I know what I mean!  So it always makes me smile when people "tell" me about Valle Luna. "There's this good little Mexican place on Cave Creek"...."Oh...Valle Luna?"...."Yes!"  Valle Luna is a place where I have had many a happy hour and super casual dinner. I prefer the cantina as I feel the service is slightly better in there...(not that I have had poor service in the restaurant it is just "happier" in the cantina.) Like my daughter told me just last night when I pointed out I like the cantina better...She said, "Yeah...the restaurant is for old people". I replied with "Yeah, and we are NOT old", which is funny because...well...I am actually old and was appreciative that my daughter didn't point that out like she normally does.  I love their seafood taco dinner with cod as well as their steak tacos. I also love that you can substitute calabicitas for the rice/beans. That gives Valle Luna a star right there. They have a really good Happy Hour menu too.So if someone mentions a Mexican place they want to go to on Cave Creek-by all means check it out!

Let me start by saying the people that work at Fuego Bistro have to be some of the nicest people in the restaurant industry. I love their food. The portions are huge and the entrees are very tasty. I love the flavor combinations. I usually get the white prawns which are absolutely delicious. I love spice and you get plenty of that at Fuego. The patio is quaint and adorable.

Ok-It pains me to have to take away a star. Dined here on Saturday. The service was really awkward and everything was a little off including the food which my dining companion noted did not "wow" him this time. I had to agree that mine was not quite as tasty as usual. I would have loved a second cocktail but our server disappeared so by that time our dinner was well over so we just decided to go somewhere else for that second drink. There were also two couples waiting for a table that just kind of loitered in our vicinity. It was strange being stared down for a table at Fuego. I am not willing to write Fuego off yet as I loved it so. I am really hoping it was just an "off" night. I don't think I can persuade my dinner date to go back there anytime soon but it is still on my list of faves.

Finally a nail salon close by that consistently does a good job as well as has great customer service. I mostly see Jenny but have had different nail techs and they are all great. I normally get the shellac manicure which lasts a long time, 2-3 weeks for me. (I am super hard on my nails).The owners are very, very nice as well. I have even had my brows done at Jadore by Myra and trust me I am the most picky person on the planet about my brows (too many mishaps in the past by previous estheticians). She did a great job. She is now only one of 3 people in the valley that I will let near my brows!

One of the cool perks of being a teacher is that I have really awesome, nice parents who take pity on me because I am pretty much stranded at school with my 35 minute lunch hour, and treat me to fabulous lunches on occasion. Because Flo's is close by I often have parents who treat me to Flo's. They have a really great lunch portion menu and their lunches come with a side salad and the crispy wonton chips. My (new) favorite dish is the Pine Nut Shrimp-absolutely delicious-one of my student's parents brought me this dish last week to celebrate the end of AIMS testing. I don't even mind that  the mere thought of salt makes me blow up like a puffer fish (let's face it-you can't really get away from sodium when it comes to Chinese food). The pine-nut shrimp and Flo's food in general is totally worth it!

Hana's is great! Everything is always fresh and delicious. It is a small establishment with friendly service. You can BYOB which is fun. I have had everything from sushi, sashimi, rolls, tempura or one of their dinner entrees and everything is absolutely delicious. I like the super casual vibe. I am just not into the foofoo sushi bars. I eat there often so shame on me for not reviewing them sooner!

I'm definitely a fan of getting my pedicures here. Sure, it is pricier than your typical nail salon but a heck of a lot more relaxing in my opinion. It is nice that the techs are focused on you and not speaking to each other in a foreign language. The decor is adorable. I always call for my appointments so I am not sure how they accomodate walk-ins.I don't even live in Arcadia but I drive here from NE Phoenix :)...

I used to like this place but unfortunately India Palace has slowly gone down hill. Waaaay down hill. Plus as I  learned, they have zero loyalty to their customers who eat there fairly regularly. Last night was the last straw. In fact my meal was like chewing straw and inedible. I ordered the Bhindi Masala which is a vegetable okra dish. I have had this several times before but tonight the okra was so tough that if I were to actually swallow it (rather than spit it out in my napkin-sorry gross but true) I guarantee my throat would have been scratched. Also our Roti bread was burned.Not once did anyone check to see how our meals were. When the waitress offered me a box for the uneaten meal at the end , I declined and explained the situation: I have had this dish before but it was like chewing wood shavings (explained it nicer than that) and she just said ok and brought us the bill with no offer to either replace it with another item or take it off the bill like 99.9% of establishments would do. So, they have lost our business and managed  to tick off a yelper over a VERY simple customer service issue.

Closest Starbucks to my house and the WORST Starbucks in town! They mess up the simplest of orders and have attitude when they can't figure out how to fix a problem. I have to drive an extra 5 minutes to the next closest Starbucks(40th and Greenway) but it is worth it because they are awesome-always get it right-and their coffee does not taste like I licked an ashtray!

As a vegetarian, I will tell you that this place is one of my favorites! I am in love with both their Massage Salad and their Kaleidoscope Salad..both of these have kale as a base..they also have 'heartier" fare for my non-vegan/vegetarian boyfriend such as sandwiches and wraps My boyfriend loves the Basil Pesto Focaccia. Unfortunately, the cafe is only open for lunch but I am holding out hope that they eventually extend their hours..

Oh True Food...I have visited you many times since your opening and you never fail to deliver on great service and yumilicious food.  I really love your Summer Salad which I had on my most recent visit...the perfect combination of ingredients..it makes my heart sing. (I hope that I can get the summer salad in the winter?) I know you like to mix things up my darling True Food...  I also had the Watermelon Rose cocktail which may be my favorite cocktail of late...  You just make me so happy True Food!! Thank you for being you and sorry I didn't review you sooner....I would never take you for granted!

I will make this short. I love sushi and this was the worst, most flavorless sushi I have ever had. I guess I have been spoiled by Hana's Japanese Eatery and the freshness and quality there. I did enjoy the cocktail which was called the Ahsosuki.

I do love Rita's. The food is creative, fresh and generally delicious. Rita's is a lot of fun when the weather is cooler and you can dine out on the patio and listen to music on a Saturday night. I have had several items on the menu The tableside guacamole is great as are the vegetable tacos.  Service is hit or miss, and at times is a bit awkward but that has never stopped us from coming back. I have not tried their Sunday brunch, however it is on my list.

We ate out on the patio last night. The weather was gorgeous the band was terrific and the food was delicious. In my previous review I forgot to mention their margaritas. They are my favorite margs in town. They are expensive but I love the fresh lime juice. I had the special which was grouper fish with asparagus and mashed potatoes. It was very flavorful and nicely prepared. My friend ordered seafood tacos.

I love massages but I am a little critical and picky about them. Not all massages I have had in my lifetime have been great. Awhile back when I belonged to one of the membership driven massage outlets, I had a therapist that chomped gum in my ear the entire massage leaving me far more uptight and tense then when I arrived. Of course that experience was an extreme, but suffice it to say that I have had my share of inconsistent and mediocre massages or massages that were uncomfortable or painful. A lot of times my neck felt a little tweaked after a massage.I know, a bit counter-intuitive right?  Fast forward to Robert who I have been seeing for a little while-maybe a year? I am losing track of time :). I see Robert fairly consistently.Robert is an outstanding massage therapist who understands body mechanics and has a boatload of training and experience. If you want a particular kind of massage, chances are Robert has been trained in it. I always leave feeling better and more relaxed than when I arrive.  His prices are more expensive than the retail strip mall chain massage places but so worth it as he is extremely effective and intuitive and will send you home feeling relaxed and rejuvenated.  I highly recommend Robert at Synchronicity Massage.

Sherene is the eyelash extension queen! I went to Sherene a couple of years ago for several months as I wanted to try out the extensions. Sherene is meticulous, extremely customer service oriented, and knows the perfect lashes for the look you are after- whether it is natural or insanely long and luscious. I would highly recommend It Girl Diva and Sherene if you are looking to pamper yourself! I was always extremely impressed that she always checked in to see how my lashes were doing the next day. Also, I have very sensitive eyes and she was very conscientious of this and used a sensitive eyelash glue on me. She is a sweetheart of a person and if you are looking to get "lashed"-I know you will love both Sherene and her work.

I love the view, food and service here. I love dinner and brunch at El Chorro. I just adore everything about this restaurant. (No, the sticky buns are not a draw for me :) I personally think they are weird with wine and dinner-I guess I am not a sticky buns kind of girl) Love the patio!This is one of my favorite places in the valley.

I have eaten at Tutti Santi on 16th street and am a fan. We were on the west side of town and decided to try this location. The menu is slightly different, however the food was equally as delicious and the service was really great. My dining companion had a salmon/mushroom/asparagus spaghetti and I had orange roughy in the divine lemon caper sauce-triple yum. Both meals were outstanding.

Big Mistake. Big. Huge. Just kidding. But really..c'mom!!! Let's start this little tale with the cold hard facts. I love getting blow outs. I get tons of them. I am not exaggerating. I mainly frequent another blow out establishment but I am an equal opportunity blow out whore and I have even been to Primp and Blow a handful of times. It is fun to mix it up.  Anyone who has poopy textured hair like me will understand...and agree that it takes a lot of work to blow out your own hair when you have thick hair that is prone to waves/kinks/frizz of an uncontrolled (not cute) nature. It never quite looks the same when you style your own hair.   Another thing you have to understand, I am actually pretty easy to please when it comes to blow drys. Worst case scenario: I tweak it a little when I get home...no biggie..it is not like a color or a cut where you could really endure some serious trauma...so it is in fact a low risk/high reward venture.  This is where the story turns south. My girl was pleasant enough. The shampoo was fine. The styling process seemed to be going okay, I was just settling into my I pad magazine when the blow dryer stops and my blow dry is apparently finished.   When you get as many blow outs as I do, you have a REALLY good idea of how long it takes to dry your hair and I am thinking "Huh? How is my hair all the way dry?"...anyway my daughter was still getting her hair done so I paid for both of us and left the tip for each stylist. Then I went into the bathroom and felt my hair and sure enough my hair was damp. I went back to the stylist and told her my hair was still wet.   She asked "Where"?   I answered "Everywhere".   She felt it and said, "It's not wet..it just feels that way because the products get cold and it makes it feel wet".   What????? Huh????? Seriously??? What kind of products are these???? Huh??   She said she would hit it with the blowdryer one more time. Which she proceeded to do for like 30 seconds. :( :( ??  I didn't want to get into it with her because I was actually starting to doubt my ability to tell the difference between damp and dry hair even though I am pretty sure I had that ability since I was a toddler. After all she is the blow dry expert.    I just waited for my daughter to get done.  Before hopping in the car I asked her to feel my hair. Well...guess what? My hair was wet.   I booked it home. Of course it was starting to frizz up and curl in a weird direction by that time.   I just strongly feel if you are in the business of drying hair you should at least get the dry part right.

This is such a great place to come for lunch or breakfast especially when it is "patio weather". I had a great time here with my friend yesterday. We came around lunch time and were seated right away. We got a great table in the shade.The weather couldn't have been more ideal. Thank god fall is here! I understand that the restaurant gets extremely busy during the weekend.The restaurant itself is very pretty and the service was fantastic.  I went with a friend who loves to eat (but you wouldn't know it by looking at her)...(I know...if she weren't so great I might have to hate on her! Just kidding!)We decided to split a couple of appetizers and an entree. We had the crab tower with avocado-pretty fantastic, the brie cheese plate, and we split a shrimp pesto salad. Everything was very delightful! We also split a chocolate toffee cookie at the very end. We were at the restaurant for a couple of hours as we had a lot of catching up to do.  This is a beautiful venue and they have private rooms and we also found out that the owners house which is right next door is available for events. The yard/courtyard was very beautiful and lush.  All in all a fantastic lunch and I hope to go there for brunch in the near future,

I was craving some red meat. Not just red meat...a juicy burger. Fortunately in my neighborhood there is this yumtastic burger joint. I previewed the menu online and theoretically could have called in my order since I was taking it to go but wanted to check it out a bit longer. I had the Beach house burger (roasted green chili, smoked mozarella, and pico de gallo) and a side of carnival corn.Well, I was pretty hungry so I actually took some nibbles of my corn on the car ride home-very tasty. It was seasoned splendidly and was delicious. My burger was great. I LOVED the grilled green chili. It was extremely tasty with just the right amount of spice. I guess I am used to green chilis being kind of soggy but this was darn near perfect and very fresh. The burger is served on a brioche bun (which I didn't eat because that is how I roll with burgers..I don't eat the bread..could have ordered it protein style with lettuce but I forgot..the bun looked tasty though!  :) In addition to burgers they have sandwiches, tacos/taco salads, and some interesting sides. I definitely would like to try the sweet potato tots and a taco salad on my next visit. Next time my meat craving kicks in..I know just the place.

Who knew a popsicle could be so special? I guess I don't get out to Tempe or Chandler much so I had not heard of Paletas Betty.  We stopped in while we were visiting the Tempe Arts Festival. It was really warm out and perfect popsicle weather. I got the Pina Pineapple. It was super refreshing. Like other posters I did not know their schtick was that all of their paletas have a "bite" taken out of the corner. I was going to "exchange" it but then realized all of the pops had bite marks. Silly Beth. I wish a store would open up closer to me because I would love to try some other flavors.

Seriously...I can't make this stuff up..a blonde chick (an employee at the restaurant) with her feet up on the bar with her gnarly converse shoes was our first visual walking into Genghis Grill...then my daughter heard her say as we were standing at stand waiting for somebody to greet us..."My shift is over they are just going to have to wait"..I am glad my daughter told me the comment she made after we had left...anyway the food station was a mess...our actual  "server" was nice enough but we will not be going back...the location near paradise valley mall is much nicer and cleaner!!!

I can't say enough positive things about Brent at Off Camber. He is absolutely wonderful at what he does. Not only is he crazy good at doing hair (cut, color, and styling...yeah...the triple threat!)..he also maintains amazing customer service. I truly can't see anyone not responding to Brent's down to earth personality.   So..I chose a color/look and I was not thrilled with it. I tried the dark root thing.It looks fabulous on the celebs and Brent had it down. After much analyzing I realized it just wasn't me. I went back the next day and he threw in some highlights and voila..I am in love with my hair color again. :)   So, because it had been my idea to go darker, I was fully prepared to pay more money to get my hair "de-rootified"...however he got me in and out in a little over an hour and refused to accept payment or even let me charge a tip since I had been in the day before.   It is very rare unfortunately to see people in the beauty industry display such a high level of integrity and excellent business practice. I have story after story about just the opposite so I am so delighted to have discovered "a keeper".   As for the studio itself, great location, lots of windows/natural light.  A friendly vibe. All of the stylists at Off Camber really seem to have it going on. I always see men and women customers in there so it is a great place for all.  I have never reviewed a salon before so this says a lot about the caliber of Off Camber.

Wound up at Kelly's last night. Our server Sierra was fantastic and a total sweetheart. Even though the bar became pretty packed (Spring Training), the service was consistently great the whole time.We had the Haloumi cheese stuffed cherry peppers as well as Ahi tuna cups. Both appetizers were delicious.Cocktails were really good and we also sampled some Jameson whiskey and ginger ale from the Jameson girls. It was overall a younger crowd last night but there was enough of a mix that it made for great people watching.

Yes! Talk about a flavor explosion in your mouth. Everything was extremely delicious. A+ on their guacamole. I had the salmon tacos and holy cow! They were quite delicious. My dinner date had the Al Pastor (roasted pork) tacos and he said and I quote "This place rocks!". Their skinny margarita was tasty and gets a thumbs up.   I must mention their bathrooms which were very clean and unisex. There is a row of bathrooms across from a row of sinks so it is quite possible you could be washing hands next to a dude. It was not very primping friendly. I wasn't about to start curling my eyelashes or applying lipstick when a strange boy could walk in..somehow that seemed a little awkward to me. It was just pee/wash hands/ and exit ASAP!  Anyway if you are looking for a creative Mexican fusion place with a great atmosphere-try Milagro Grill!

I like this place. We sat at the bar and had fantastic service from Bobby. One (of many things) that Fox does right is they hire/train their staff and the service is always terrific  I always enjoy watching how everyone pitches in and all of the employees' outstanding attention to detail. I think other restaurants should take note, food tastes better when you are well taken care of...seriously!  I had a sour cherry paloma cocktail (a tequila based drink)  and I have to say it is probably my favorite drink in town now. Very yummy!It was served (as was my friend's beer) in a cute mason jar. The one caveat was that it was an $11.00 drink, (but easy to justify since I get a lot of Fox gift cards as gifts and used one Saturday night.) :) Yay!  My friend and I decided to share shrimp cocktail which I felt was a generous portion and the sauce had the right amount of kick. We also shared the king crab with butter in jar w/ grilled bread...yum...very succulent (not a word I use a lot...but my brain kept thinking it while I was eating...so i will go with it)...:) We also ordered some garlic fries with aioli saude..(oink..oink) They were thick cut wedges-pretty good but I probably wouldn't order them again.( I will save my french fry quota for the year for El Charro and their to-die-for truffle fries..)  I did not partake in their oysters which is their specialty but have made a commitment that that will be the route I take next time I am there.  The restaurant is located in the midst of the Yard and Culinary dropout and the Yard bar was hopping on Saturday night. Little Cleo's itself is quite small and very modern with an open kitchen and the back wall of restaurant opposite the  bar is all windows so you can people watch if you are so inclined.

Yippee! I was so looking forward to trying Flower Child especially after seeing their menu online. As I mentioned in previous reviews I am a fan of Fox Restaurants and I feel like Sam Fox is like Midas and again he has turned a dining establishment into gold.   My friend and I ate lunch there today. Flower Child is a fast casual concept where you place your order and then they bring you your food.  I ordered the Asian Avocado salad and a side of sweet corn w/ quinoa. Everything was absolutely delicious. I pretty much devoured the whole meal. I let my friend do most of the talking while we were eating because I was enjoying the food so much! My brain was in total food reward mode.   Oh...did I mention that they have gluten free baked goods? I had a gluten free bittersweet brownie and I'm pretty sure it revolutionized my entire life. I'm pretty sure if the brownie were a man, we would be walking down the aisle.
