Not only is the food overpriced and barely edible, the service is horrible! For the money, if you really need a chain restaurant, head down the road to Chilli's.

First of all, I love to eat. Second of all, I am not a $30,000 millionaire, nor do I pretend to be one. I don't have a lot of money to splurge or waste, and most of my meals out (for my boyfriend and I) are rarely more than $30. Having said that, I was so pleased with the value here! We decided to skip Valentine's Day, and went for a "flashy" dinner on a Tuesday evening. I had a 20% off coupon, so we felt comfortable going all out. We started with oysters on the half shell, they had a mix platter so you could sample all 6 of the various types of oyster they had in house that day. Delish! Next, we ordered lobster bisque and wedge salads, two of my favorites and they were amazing. Next, came our main courses: surf and turf for me and shrimp scampi for him. Both were amazing. My filet was cooked to perfection - I asked for medium-rare and, what a concept, they served it medium-rare! It sounds like an easy "duh", but for some reason chefs in the valley are afraid to serve anything with pink! Everything was great, though, services was a little slow, but, I assume that has to do with the old-school vibe of the place, dark booths, lots of gray hair, and an old-school attention to detail and the thought that dining should be an experience enjoyed throughout the evening, not 50 minute race for the check.   The next time I am in the mood for a "splurge", McCormick & Schmicks will definitely be on the top of my list!

LGO is by far my favorite place for breakfast in the valley. LGO is the reason I live in the neighborhood! The only down side is the tiny parking lot fills up quickly, weekend mornings and most evenings for dinner. One reason I chose to move near LGO was so I could walk or ride my bike to breakfast. I have had almost everything on the breakfast menu, and loved everything. The muffins from Tammy Coe are to die for. I always stop in the Grocery to grab bread or cheese for nice dinners or even a picnic lunch.  Stopping by after work for pizza and gelato has also become a bi-monthly occurance in our house. The pizza is light, crispy with amazingly fresh ingredients (if you eat breakfast there, you will see the chefs chopping and preparing the fresh veggies, pepperoni, salami, etc. in anticipation of the evenings pizza and salad orders). I recommend LGO to everyone I meet, and it is always my dinner suggestion and favorite place to take out of town guests!

This was an amazing place to live, quiet, safe, comfortable for the last 3 years....until management changed. The new manager's family now owns the property and he is letting in every gang-banger in town move it. Not only are the neighbors totally intimidating, but they have 2 adults and 2 children (or more) in one bedroom apartments, WITH a giant pitbull that they never have on a leash. Telling the manager wouldn't do a darn bit of good, because the irksome neighbors are all related to the manager and the building owners.  Such a sad, sad change. Noise all the time, and now I feel completely unsafe in my neighborhood. Just a few months and I can get out of here!

A crew of 12 of us descended upon Joey's at about 7:30p on a Saturday. We called ahead to let them know we were coming in and the could not have been more accommodating! We tried for about an hour and 5 different restaurants to find some place that could seat all of us, without having to wait until 9pm, and Joey's was happy to have us. The specials were amazing, the Lobster Ravioli was delightful! For a party of 12, the service was unbelievably quick, no food lottery or order mix ups. I would definitely head back to try the veal!

I went here for the first time with some friends this weekend. The food was amazing! I had the chicken club pita and it was so delicious. Normally when I eat at a sandwich shop, I am ready for sandwich number two after about an hour or so, but I was satisfied and wasn't hungry until dinner time (for a first!). The service left a little to be desired, it took a bit of time to get our food, and I think we repeated out order about 4 times before they "got it". But, I would totally go back, too bad there isn't on in my neck of the woods.

I have been pricing flowers at shops all OVER the valley, from Gilbert to Mesa to Tempe to Scottsdale...Karen's had the MOST competitive prices and were happy to do what EVER I wanted. I will give a better score once I get my order!!!

The hostess is a rude, crude example of why dealing with the service industry sucks! Cash only? Please, what year is it? The hosted threw mad amounts of attitude to my VERY pregnant friend. Then we didn't even have english speaking wait staff...

I have been a patron of Pita Jungle for 12 years. This was my go-to place in college, during my vegetarian and vegan years...And even now, as a carnivore, making the trip is ALWAYS a highly anticipated event. Not only is the ambiance great (amazing local artist's work on the walls), open yet cozy dining room, cool/hip looking wait staff, but the food is amazing. Even if you hate vegetarian or middle eastern food, this place will win you over.  The hummus is a must have. A friend and I can easily polish through an order, without filling guilty or gross. I've head everything from the salads to the pizza to the pasta, but I must say I always go for the falafel pita. The seasoning is amazing, the veggies are fresh, the pita is made in house...You can eat a great, healthy meal, and not feel hungry 45 minutes later.   It's also a great first date place, because it's not too fancy, not too casual, and if the date goes bad, there are plenty of things to distract you! If you run out of conversation, just discuss the art on the walls. And, you don't feel awkward about ordering what ever you want, without wondering if you are spending too much!

The best Whole Foods in the Valley!! The store is gorgeous, the staff are hot, crunchy, sexy, granola types (totally worth the trip). The whole staff will BS with you and joke around, yet they are extremely knowledged on the food they sell. Some things can be a bit spendy ($25/lb for prosciutto)...but the cheese, the fruit, omg...And you can buy some vegan shoes while you're at it!!!

Way over priced and WAY pushy people! Really? There is now way the average person buys $140 worth of tea a month!!!!! Never spending money there again! They push these 1 LB containers of tea (mind you the average tea is $10 per ounce!), and the "air tight, light tight containers" are $7 a piece, they don't give you an option for anything else... My boy friend and I were really looking forward to learning about tea and trying something new, and this definitely put a damper on our excitement. Cost Plus had tea pots just as nice for 1/5th of what Teavana was charging (and some yummy teas at half the price)!

Had an amazing brunch this morning! The chicken was perfect (especially dipped in hot sauce and honey!), the home style potatos were great, and the cheesy grits would have made my grandmama smile! I highly recommend LoLo's, the staff was great & fun to be around, but be prepared for the carb coma that will soon follow after your last bite!

I was SO looking forward to eating at Modern Steak. A group of friends decided we should hit up Modern Steak for dessert, we were a large party, so we made reservations about 2 weeks in advance. We arrived and I was so impressed with the decor, I knew we were in for a treat. We were ushered  to a private room in the back. I was a little surprised at the set up, they had one long table set up for about 20-24 people (we were only a group of 15), and the only way to get from one side of the table to the other (or out of the room if god forbid you had to exit to use the restroom), was through a narrow, 12 inch space between the edge of the table and the glass wall. The wait staff quickly brought in our desserts, a selection of mini-cupcakes (my favorite), including carrot cake, banana, chocolate and of course red velvet. We attempted to make drink orders (I believe the wait staff took half of the table's drink orders), after asking the waiter for some wine recommendations, he said he would send the sommolier in. I think the sommolier came in with one person's wine. It was so chatotic it was hard to say what was going on. After 15 minutes, I had yet to even receive a glass of water, and did not get to start on my cupcakes until after asking several waiters (and getting dirty looks) for a glass of water. The cupcakes were the only thought that kept me going, I knew they were going to be worth it...what a giant let down. Save your money and whip up a batch of Duncan Hines Red Velvet cupcakes, they will be a HUNDRED times better. I doubt I will ever return to Modern Steak.

I'm super bummed that the Gilbert Lolo's is such a disappointment. I loved the old Scottsdale location, this one leaves much to be desired. We tried it once, when they first opened in May, and the service was awful. It took way too long to get our appetizers, and even longer to get our meal. Then once we did get our food, we couldn't begin eating because we didn't have any condiments. By the time the condiments arrived, the food was cold. We never got our drinks refilled. We were ignored for the most part. It was a 2 hour meal, on a school night, and my kids were unhappy, I was unhappy and my husband was unhappy. We decided to try again last night, without the kids. It was a bad experience again. While the service wasn't quite as bad, they found additional ways to ruin the meal. First of all, they sat us right next to door (when there were plenty of other tables open). My husband and I ordered and they came back and said they were out of burgers. He made an alternate choice, and a few moments before they were bringing out his meal, they informed us that a key ingredient in his sandwich (the bread) was also unavailable....I'm sorry what? So they put his sandwich on a sesame seed bun. Not a big deal, but still. If you are out of something, let people know before hand. My meal was ok. Not great, just ok. It's not cheap food. It was $50 for the two of us, my expectations should be met. And $3.50 for a jar of kool-aid?! But after two things my husband wanted, they still didn't offer to comp part of the meal. We gave it a try, but will not be returning.
