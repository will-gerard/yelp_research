Cashier was very quiet. Could not hear her. Almost slipped on some water walking to table. Food was great and person serving it was very nice.

This place is great! Love having this place as an option to fast food. Amazing food like pei Wei spicy chicken, Mongolian beef, and great sushi for not being a sushi place. Great service. Only downside is parking can be rough during two hour lunch rush

I love this place. Locally owned for over 20 years by this couple. They are always the ones you will be working with. They have so much knowledge and love helping people. I bought some Oliver Peoples sunglasses there recently and love them. Very nice people. If you need glasses for the first time or need some cool frames that everyone else doesn't have go see Ray and Diana!

First time to this location, floor was a little dirty. Food was good as usual. Maybe good mid fast food option. Chips could be better. Service is always good.

Didn't know this place was here. Was at auto repair shop and needed a close place. First off the location isn't the cleanest. Old strip mall. Looks run down. Walk in and you see a small counter with a older man and a long hallway. Weird and unpleasant. Needs to be open and would like to quickly survey the place. This odd man that did not fit in at all walked me down hallway to seating area. Wow! This place is outdated big time. The carpet is old and dark and grungy. Looks like a bad 80's hotel carpet. Old booths and tables and lots of old people. I wanted to back out but felt obligated to try it out.  Decided to try a lunch special of the spagetti  and meatballs. Came with choice of soup or salad. Tried chili and that was a mistake. Was not good. Much better at Wendy's. The spaghetti was ok. Definitely won't order that again. I think this place must have good pizza. Seems to be a great place for a take out pizza or for old people. I even tried to google pizza places while inside this place and they don't show up. Sends me to here other pizza joints a few miles away. They need a good updating in many ways. If I come back it will be to try the pizza. But can't see that happening.

Good service, by far the best tasting healthy option fast food you will get. Faster than McDonald's drive thru. Love the quarter and half chicken plate. Brings food to table on a plate. Hank you for the fast option.

Didn't realize this was the old bobby mcgees till I pulled up. Came based on reviews and was skeptical. The only down side was the price. But the place deserves the high ranking. Not your typical BBQ lunch dive. Very nice place. Tried the Q rolls based on reviews. It was good but not something I have to have. Wish I didn't get em because I couldn't finish everything. Carolina q. Pulled pork with slaw and side of mac n cheese. They were right. Mac was solid. Corn bread was by far my favorite corn bread from a restaurant. Sand which was super. Four stars in conservative. Maybe 4.5. Try this place if you haven't been. To pricy to come often for me. But the service was high quality and atmosphere was great.

Sampler platter - chicken : moist and pre sliced. I like that. Beef : sliced thin also. About 1/8 ". Pink on edges. Tastes good. Nothing life changing. Pork :  they do this really well. Shredded and moist and you can really taste the slow smoke. Ribs : fantastic lots of meat. Sweat sauce. Tender.  Side of potatoes are a must. The cheesy green Chili's make it awesome. The chocolate chip cookie is worth the trip alone. Very nostalgic place with history. A must visit if for some reason you have not been there. Take the family. You really have not been here?? Stop reading and just go.

The resort is nice, the room we stayed is was very nice but I'm giving one star because I am so disappointed in dishonest room cleaners. My wife left 5 bathing suits on a drawer. We called the next day to inquire and come back to get them but they were never found. No one else had stayed in room since report. Tried each week for two weeks after and just told sorry nothing found. So I guess all I can do is voice my opinion here. Expect more from a place like this.

Comfy seats. That's it. This place is filthy. Was not busy, crap all over carpets, bathrooms were a wreck. Do not like the fact that they don't butter popcorn for you so u can layer it. Harkins kills this place.

Loved walking in and being greeted by a huge genuine smile and a beautiful atmosphere. (Reba) Never been here before but heard it was good pizza and it was lunch time. I'm not into gelato or desserts but dang the selection looked amazing. I tried the pineapple and ham lunch pizza. Made fresh in a brick oven pizza right over my shoulder. Tasted so fresh and I liked how they sliced the pineapple. The price was only $8 and it filled me up. I could have eatin more so if your a big eater you might go with bigger pizza.  That's good for the quality of the pie. The waitress and the other lady working seemed to be in such good moods. Just liked everything about this place. II will be back.  Ok. She talked me into trying the Gelato. And I'm now hooked. Haha.

Due to some changes in diet I had to try the chicken nuggets. I think my son said it best. They are "the best of the worst" . Better than crap like McDonald and Carl's jr but still kinda weak. Went thru drive thru and they forgot a couple items so had to go back in. Handled it well though. Didn't ask for receipt or question it. My wife enjoyed her small Caesars salad.

This is a 3.5 star mexican restaurant. Great for the family as it is loud and a bit messy. Love places that give you bean dip and salsa with the chips. The cheese crisp was good and the guac was great. Similar to oreganos guac. Chimi wasn't bad and the sopapillas were tasty. Server did a great job and was on top of drinks all night. Don't feel so good leaving though. Haha.

This review is solely based on apple pay vs subway app. I didn't have my wallet today so I searched for places that took apple pay. Google said McDonald's and subway where fast to jump on board Apple pay so I went in. I first asked cashier if they took it, he said no after some confusion and lack of English skills. They have only a subway app. So I signed up for app and input my card and proceeded to order. The app said to scan the qr code the cashier would give me but the cashier rep was clueless and said they don't have scanner. It did not work even though all the verbiage on the signs promoting pay by app. Horrible. Get with the times.

I always get the chicken kabab. Grilled skewered chicken that is just bursting with flavor. Served on a bed of yellow rise with a small side salad that consists of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and some type of dressing. A pita on the side with some hummus. Everything tastes great and seems healthy to me. Great lunch for under $9 the owner is always at the register and knows who I am and is always nice. Always clean with a couple TVs with sports on. Usually soccer.

Good service with a smile, great fresh food, clean and price is good. Wish guacamole wasn't so expensive. And I wish they would not put those big chunks of red onion in everything. Other than that it's a great lunch and dinner option .

I don't go to many sushi places but I was referred to this one so my wife and I gave it a shot. We have been hooked since. Seems to be high quality well made sushi with many options. We love the vegas roll, crunch roll and lava roll. The atmosphere is nice but cramped. Big bar with a few TVs with sports on. The exterior windows are very tinted to it looks closed every time we go. Do be fooled. Glad to have this option in QC . Keep up the good work.

We have been to a few places. This was our second time here. Was trying to book two in advance for valentines. The other places never answered phone. Tried 4 times before calling this place. Jim the owner answered and hooked me up. He was great. We did 90 minutes this time. Wife and I both love reflexology as a way to relax and get some tension out. My wife seems to have a better experience than I do. I feel my girl is always hitting my spine or spending way to much time on my toes or temple. Kinda wish I could leave feedback. But overall it's great and it feels good. I still prefer a regular massage but for reflexology this location is great and I appreciate Jims excellent customer service.

This place consistently has great customer service and the food is consistent and fresh. I tried the steak tacos tonight and loved it. I hate paying extra for the quac but it tastes so good I do it anyway. Every Once in awhile  the steak is a bit chewy or grisly but the steak is head and shoulders above any other semi fast food options. Great job all the way around. Need more quality semi fast dinner options like this.

5 star review based mostly on experience. I realize it's a chain and may not be the most authentic home made ice cream but it tastes great. My 5 star comes from our experience. We got a craving as a family late last night and at 9:40 looked up hours and noticed they close at 10pm. We (family) jumped in car and raced over hoping to get a good reception. 10 mins before closing you never know what to expect. Closed doors? Grumpy employee cause he doesn't want to clean up again or is ready to leave. We walked in to smiling faces and they could not have been more helpful. Very impressed with the young girl. It tasted great as usual and had a fun late night sugar rush thanks to the great staff.

Love this place. Never ending bowl of pasta and a thin crust for the family. Ordered the guacatoni appetizer today. Amazing. The cheese crisp they serve it with is magic. I noticed today the pizza was better without pepperoni. Will go with just cheese next time. He diet Pepsi is perfect. Price is ok. Service is usually really good. Tonight's was great. Usually always a long wait. Only down side tonight.

This place tastes so good. Love the red raspberry sorbet!!!  I have also had the green juices. Fresh blueberries, bananas, coconut water, strawberries etc. so good and healthy. The girl at the front desk was nice. Will be back.  They serve espresso and lattes but I don't drink those.

It's tough to give a fast food chain 4 stars but this is by far my favorite. I just call it "crack"cause it addicting. I love the crispy outside of the chicken. The meat is definitely high quality. The sauce is perfect and the Side bread is incredibly tasty and incredibly unhealthy. Crinkle cut fries are perfect.

Found this place recently. Had to try it. This is exactly what small local business is all about. Amazing home cooked pierogis by the owner and her family. Really small kitchen and dining area but she is expanding next door to separate the grocery from the dining. You can buy frozen hand made pierogis and take home or many other authentic foods, spices etc. I recommend the pierogi plate and trying the cheddar and jalapeño. I will be back. Support local business.

Since it seems to be a vegan place I feel the need to clarify I am not vegan and only semi healthy. I like good tasty food but I also like to try fresh healthy options. I ordered the half wrap (split pea) and a side. (Lemon garlic brown rice. The wrap was enjoyable and fresh. The lemon garlic was not so much. I should have sampled it. They offer samples of the sides. My bad. I like the changing menu and the outside seating. No inside seating available. Friendly staff and clean. I can't say anything bad about food other than it just isn't as tasty as the unhealthy stuff. Glad to have this option and I hope they stick around. Now I just need to go find a cookie shop cause my taste buds are addicted to the yummy stuff.

This place has gone down hill fast. We go here almost weekly. A few Saturday's ago I pulled up and could not get anyone to answer drive thru com. So I pulled forward and could see some guys in there but would not acknowledge me. Finally flagged down a dude who came to window obviously fired up and Said the owners partner or brother just came in and was totally racist to all he workers and yelled at them. "Everyone is walking out" . They were all younger Hispanic men. I literally caught them in the middle of all quitting. I calmed the guy down and told him I was sorry for what happened. Not acceptable. He was cool and still filled my order. But I have been back four times and each time the wait and communication has gotten worse. People have been very polite but today they didn't have sausage and the wait was as usual crazy long. The guy taking order was very nice but couldn't take the order without us repeating several times. Bummer. Ticked off the employees were treated poorly. Wish this place would get it together. Cannot recommend right now. Hit and miss and expect a long wait. BTW we only get the sausage breakfast burro.

Fantastic little place for healthy eaters who don't want tasteless food. I love their son breakfast bowl. Brown rice with spinach , eggs, mushrooms and onions. Looks like they have amazing real fresh juices. Going to get one next time. Prices are reasonable. Need to go back for lunch. May change to a 5 star if the lunch tastes as good.

Have been getting the Zen bowl for breakfast weekly. It's scrambled eggs, onions, spinach and mushrooms on brown rice. Been a great breakfast option for me but the scrambled eggs have been getting over cooked a lot. Like major browning from letting it just sit in the pan instead of actually scrambling. The last time I ordered this I asked them to make sure and not over cook the eggs. Well it was worse than ever. Not craving it anymore. Makes the eggs very dry.  Also noticing the help never has a smile and seems to have a bit of an attitude. To bad. This place is yummy.

Updating my review based on the feedback I received from Managment on my review. I appreciate local small business's that take the time to listen and respond to feed back. This place obviously cares about creating quality and healthy food that frankly cannot be found at to many places.

I think this place is great. I love any place that can give me a fast meal lunch or dinner that tastes awesome and gives me an option over typical fast food. Love the sweet pork salad. Always consistent. Service is typically good. Great for the family dinner or a quick lunch. Also allows me to eat here when I can't have bread.

Not sure why but I it seems they have changed portion size. I have loved this place but I just ordered the 3 finger combo $7 and was disappointed the chicken strips look smaller, and fry portion is smaller. Disappointing they can't stay consistent. These are more like nuggets .

I'm giving them a 4 star because I think it's the best for fast cheap pizza . By no means a top quality slice for the upper crusts of pizza but for a quick regular crust pepperoni pie for under $6 it rocks. Plus the crust with butter cheese is awesome!! Clean store and usually friendly staff. Charge extra for ranch. Lots of TVs with sports while u wait or eat.

We sat out on back back as we had a large group. The menu and the smell was amazing. We never ended up ordering main dishes for some reason but the manager brought us some additional appetizers to try. It was very filling. We tried the nachos (best tasting nacho ever ) see picture , wings (very good but nothing crazy) , bacon platter (this was really cool and yummy lots of bacon fat, had many different types of bacon, PB&J sliders. Essentially looked like a big piece of bacon fat on a slider roll with lettuce and tomato (it was good but not great)  I know had I tried the smoked brisket this review  would have been 6 stars but i can only review the app's for now. Customer service was stellar. Should be back.

Great option for a yummy treat. Nice people who are local and support other local small biz. And yes the waffles are amazing. We love the Nana. Nutella bananas and cream. Line can get long as they can only fit so many workers in there but it's worth the wait. Follow on Instagram to keep tabs on locations. They move around.

First time here. Heard the tacos were good. Was shocked to see they have been beat up on Yelp. I decided to make sure I didn't let that bias get in the way of my real experience or perception. Was pleased to see free guac and chips upon my first check in. Nice to see a decent give away for a check in. The guac was great. Chip are thin like I em. Appeared to be made fresh. Ordered a steak and a chicken street taco. Not very big but about the norm for a gourmet taco. Chicken was shredded and in a type of sweet sauce. Was yummy. Both were good but not awesome. The service was was great. Was checked on by multiple people. I think they are making an effort to fix customer service issues. My visit wasn't during rush hour. So all I can say is that the service was great, atmosphere was cool, TVs were very nice and everywhere and the food was good.

3.5 stars. I thought this would be typical sports bar food where the food is second rate and all greasy. But it tastes pretty good. I ordered the barbecue chicken sand which and fries. When it was delivered I thought my theory of crappy food and sports bars would hold up but it actually tastes really good. The fries were yummy. Not the typical frozen flair every sports bar orders. It's still a sports bar but the food was better than most. Price was decent. Waitress was great! Lots of tvs and space. Definitely great for the average sports night binge.

Tried the all you can eat lunch. Beware, they say they will charge you for leftovers so don't waste and don't plan on taking home. The sashimi was great, the Las Vegas roll was just ok. I have had better. The California rolls were normal. Good service , seems clean.

I think everyone knows this by now but they deserve a good review just like any other small biz. This place rarely disappoints. I love the fresh crisp lettuce and perfect thick slices of tomato. Went with my fries animal style tonight and the taste was amazing as always. Thank you in and out for always be consistent with good food and great service with a smile.

First time today. Had a line about 25 long today. After order was a bit of a wait as well. But that's the east valley for you. We attack the new hot spots as their is not much out here. Ordered the jasper and added a few things. Loved not having to worry about extra charges for toppings. The mod or regular size was perfect for just me. Pizza was fantastic. Will be back.

Not easy to find but this place is fantastic. Very nice man who runs it. Been here forever and has over 800 customers. A bit messy in front area but kinda adds to the old nostalgia of shoe repair.  Did a great job on a quick shoe shine. Love local small business's like this.

very excited to find this place. A ton of options, I had to ask the cashier his favorite. He was helpful and mentioned two. One on the menu and one off. I went with the Paul Rueben. It was awesome. A ton of food. I would give this place 5 stars if the price was not so high. Little room to sit inside, but very casual and friendly.

First time eating here today and I will be back for sure. The atmosphere was open, modern and clean. Had a bunch of local art on the walls. Love the local feel. Had the eggs Benedict OT style with avocado and chorizo. Was awesome. Craig the owner was there and gave me a sample after of their famous bananas foster French toast. Wow! That syrup was like nothing I have had before. It was a mix between a great French toast and just like grandma made sticky buns.  Staff was nice and helpful. Bathroom was clean. Parking can be tough but not in the morning.

So glad we have something else to choose from in queen creek. Nice atmosphere, the service was very good. The food was good to great but nothing off the charts for me. My wife and I split a chicken caesar salad and the 4 cheese mac and cheese with sausage I think. The salad was good but they chopped up the chicken really small. I got hooked on carrabas Caesar. By far the best Cesar I have ever had. The Mac n cheese looked a little underwhelming at first but it ended up tasting great. The sausage is very spicy which I liked. Without the sausage it would not have been anything special . I'll go back and try some other dishes.

Not impressed. I think this will be good for a teen age hangout like filabertos. But I would rather drive to some burros. The place looked close from outside. The open light was off and it had a hand written note on door.  The cashier was chilling while the place was empty but a table was a full mess. I just wanted and asked for a bean and cheese burro and didn't pay attention to total but ended up with a full meal with beans and rice. No big deal though. The burro was fine but was buried in beans. Couldn't pick it up. The place is small and a little dirt my for a new place. Same owners as the original Mattas in Mesa. Obviously not aware . This place is getting its teeth kicked on yelp . But like any new place in QC it will go good for awhile cause we need options. But this place better get their act together . I might go again out of convenience but certainly not tempting.

I may just be a homer but I love my Harkins. Good service, work hard to keep it clean, they do a good job on line control for big features. I like the seats and front row in front of the bars for a foot rest. I've been to other theaters in other states and I still will go out of my way to choose Harkins over amc and any others.

First time here today. Like seeing downtown Gilbert hopping. Hope it works for all of these places. Especially the locally owned ones. First off the guy who served me was very nice and attentive. Suggested I try both the cod and regular fish taco since I was wanting to try what they were known for. I liked the cod better actually. So glad he suggested both. Portions were average. It's a good quality fish taco. Quality above a rubios but not as good as Baja fish tacos. But close. Great atmosphere. Found out the owner was the one who helped me. Hope all his employees serve like that. Isn't that always the magic wand for places like this.   Go give this place a try and support local biz. Form your own opinion. But don't be a bitch. No one is perfect

Great hot dogs, the beef sandwiches are amazing. Those are the only two things I have had here. Will try a burger next time. They look good. The crinkle cut fries are fantastic as well. Big eating area and very family friendly casual. Parking can be tough. Don't like asking for refills.
