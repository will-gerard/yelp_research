I live across the street from Tacos De Juarez, it is situated on 7th street and Roosevelt in downtown Phoenix next to the bus station. This location is not easy to find unless you know where to look, essentially you are looking for a large skeleton mural on the east side of 7th street. If you see the skeleton you are BALLIN! Go inside and order something, anything.  The parking is a little confusing and probably puts a lot of people off as this is near a busy intersection, there are more spots to park in the back.   They take phone orders but we walked in to place our order on our first visit. They were prompt and the food was incredible. We tried several different chimi variations and they kindly put all of the toppings on the side. The chimi's are a little dry and the second time we ordered the same meal they left out the guacamole which was... devastating. The red salsa is amazing and made up for it though.   This place is just short of a 5 star mexican joint, I will update my review as I try more items and interact with the carryout system. With a few tweaks I think this could be a really serious relationship for me.

One thing that you will quickly realize once you propose is that everyone in the wedding industry attempts to gouge you at every turn, why? Because they can.  This establishment is not one of these places. We used Rose tuxedo to rent tuxes for our evening and every part of the experience was absolutely seamless and stress free. I told all of my groomsmen to meet me at the shop at the same time to see if they could handle the stress and boy could they!  The woman on duty took all of our measurements and guided us through the process with steadfast focus. They even threw in free shoes for everyone since we all ordered the most expensive tuxes (Michael Kors at the time).   I highly recommend this business, they will fulfill SOME of your wildest dreams concerning tuxedos and wearing tuxedos.

Seamus McCaffrey's is one of the top dive bars in the downtown Phoenix area. There are several reasons why:  It has one of the best, busiest (and cramped on the weekends) patios in Phoenix. It is likely that if you arrive later in the evening it will be difficult to procure a drink or a spot. However, do not give up, with a little practice you too can learn the "Seamus Slither". This is a concept of my own invention where you must slither through the crowds to reach a good spot on the patio. Usually the bros are kept out so there's little threat of unpleasantness.   Some people have mentioned that the bathroom is not up to par, well, it's a dive bar so get over it. The bathroom is towards the back and up the stairs, have fun.   Another great thing about Seamus is that it is in the middle of what is starting to become a bar district on Monroe Street. It lays directly across from the alley leading to Valley Bar and if Cornish Pasty ever opens it too is on this street. This bar is also one of the best hubs to pick up a pedi-cab (or regular cab if you're into that) downtown.  The food is average, it's really typical bar food but I love that the kitchen stays open really late (I'm not sure what time they stop but I've stumbled in well-past midnight and was served). The fish and shrimp is my go to.   Drinks are typical downtown prices... I don't know, I never bother to ask how much I'm paying for drinks.   PEDI-CAB!

The hostess here is terrible. Still waiting for a solid hour for a table. We were told our name was called (not true as we were sitting on the couch near the door where the surly hostess emerges). When we inquired why we were being passed up for a table we were then graciously added to the bottom of the list. People were literally waiting 5 minutes for a table. Unbelievable.

Charlie's is truly a despicable establishment. They are sexist and will steal your money.

The Vine Tavern (i'll omit the word Eatery as i'm fairly certain this term can't be applied to the food they serve at this establishment) is a vortex sort of culmination hang-out for low-brow Fred Durst clones and future (day-shift) strippers. With that being said, this cesspool of a building hasn't burned to the ground yet so I feel compelled to warn others before they consider spending an evening there.  Being new to the Tempe area, myself and a small group of friends decided to drop in to check it out.  As we approached the-dimly lit building I began to have second thoughts: my bloomy sense was tingling (more on this later). As we entered we were greeted by a lovely bouncer type gentlemen who begged us to pay the 5$ cover.... seriously. We were seated towards the back near a group of teenage mothers and their burly counterparts. We ordered food...  The food arrived in a timely manner, it may have been poisoned but i was too hungry to care. I ordered the mushroom/swiss burger.... 9 dollars-ish. If Mcdonalds ever begins selling their products in the frozen food aisle of grocery stores it might taste something like what they serve at The Vine. I had immediate food regret, my only consolation was the 1$ you call its and the poor old man behind the mic with his acoustic guitar wrapping up his set. Surreal. .. . .We regrettably paid and escaped out the back.   Good: Cheap Drinks !!!!   Bad: You may be stabbed!!!

I have been coming to Carly's for several years, usually as a jumping off point for a downtown adventure. This has always been a great neighborhood bar, the recent patio expansion has really put it over the top.  Sometimes they have The Walking Dead on the little tv on Sundays which is great if you like gore while you're eating, which I do. My wife does not though because she is weird, but we won't go into that right now, I'll tell you all about her over the coming months and years.  My favorite sandwich is the Santa Fe, there's just something about those green chillis and pepperjack cheese that make me want to stab a zombie in the skull.  The staff is always nice, def not hipster service, good music. The patio is also nice for people-watching the 1 day a month when people are gallivanting around Roosevelt for First Friday. I say people but what I really mean is the throng of teenagers roaming around.  7 thumbs up.

I held my birthday dinner recently at St. Francis and I can't wait to go back. We tried this place out for 2 reasons: The positive reviews and the awesome facade of the restaurant. The building looks really inviting from the outside, you'll understand once you see it.  The staff were very accommodating and the food was excellent. Try the pig-dip it's fantastic, made on their house-baked bread. They were able to organize a table for about 15 people on short-notice, they even delivered me a drink from the bar when a well-wisher who couldn't attend called the restaurant to send me a birthday beverage.   I feel reluctant to give this place 5 stars at this time, I will need to return to try more of the food before I upgrade my review. I am looking forward to it.

This is, by far, the absolute worst Filiberto's franchise in the valley. I have been coming back to fili b's time and again, year after year, out of.... sheer laziness I suppose.   The orders are frequently wrong, my tacos are always cold (YES COLD) the food is always sub-par and every time I'm forced to come here (usually hungover on a Sunday morning) I cringe a little bit.  U know i would love to know what MR. Filiberto thinks about the sullying of his legendary name by this poor excuse for a restaurant. This is, by all accounts, the Oakland Raiders of the Valley's Fili b's: brash, lazy, and lacking a good quarterback... I mean manager.  7 thumbs down

There are only a few breakfast places in downtown Phoenix so when people talk about breakfast/brunch I think they tend to want to believe that the places down here are acceptable. I am wise to the game though, I understand that it is out of necessity that people support these places because otherwise, what are we gonna do? Not eat breakfast? This is not an option obviously.   JoBot does a lot of things, each time I walk by there is something different going on and this is great. It should be no surprise that you will probably experience hipster-service here (blaring rap music inside at 8am, cold looks of disdian etc...). It is a universal fact that the coffee is terrible (before you attempt to refute this, walk down Roosevelt and take a random poll, I guarantee that 9/10 people will agree) It is almost the mantra of JoBot. I remember years ago stepping in here for a shot of espresso after a first-friday and being so underwhelmed that I didn't return for 4 years.  Recently I walked over to eat breakfast here, I paid 13$ for 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 1 pancake and 1 glass of orange juice. It was OK, nothing special, I felt really let-down. I'm definitely open to spending some more time and money as it is a nice little place in the neighborhood but I will never eat breakfast here again.

What can I say about Crescent Ballroom that has not already been said? I don't know I think probably it would be advantageous if I just made up a totally original story all together.  Now we all know that this is one of the top mid-size concert venues in the downtown Phoenix area but did you know that our beloved hot-spot was once the original site of an intriguing and grandiose legend, the likes of which (if recounted here) would shake Phoenix's collective bones and send the lot of you scurrying for cover?  The story came to me by accident one day as I was rummaging through my archives for a recipe that was long-forgotten. The interesting thing about this recipe is that it called for both GINGER and AVOCADO. Now I know what you're all thinking: "Hold on a second here, those two flavors would totally clash." And I swear to you on my children's graves that I would have agreed with you if I didn't have the good fortune of tasting it myself.   Speaking of Avocado, The Crescent Ballroom has an array of wonderful food items, I like the carne asada tacos when I've had a few too many (ideas). Anyways where was I? Oh Yes, the story, OK so the story goes that a young traveler knocked on the door of what is now the Crescent Ballroom building, our hero could hear music emanating from inside but no one answered.   Speaking of music The Crescent Ballroom has a wonderful array of acts that are too small for a larger venue but too big to play in a monthly storage facility. To hear the conclusion of this sprawling story follow my next review. Where will it appear? I don't know yet just click on my profile.

As an Arizonian, an avid late-night drinker and a Mexican food aficionado I believe I have a unique perspective on the competitive hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints in the Southwest. Rather than bore you with the succulent  and intimate details of the carnitas tacos combo I would ask you to suspend your idea of a yelp review for a moment as I recount the mythos behind: BETITO!  I'm not sure who Betito is exactly, my girlfriend believes he is the man who works the drive-through window day and night, slaving over a cash register and hot stove to provide good, quality meals for drunks and derelicts alike.   You may be thinking: Why doesn't he just ask the guy at the drive through if he is actually Betito? It's a valid question but not how I like to live my life. Instead, I enjoy speculating wildly on how Betito came to this country, acquired his recipes and built a tiny little empire. ...  I suspect it all started perhaps through some type of betrayal, there was a splintering off of the Betito family and they each took a portion of an ancient Mexican food recipe book as SEED MONEY!  Betito showed them though, I like to imagine that he is the keeper of this ancient book after stamping out the rest of his family members. With the competition now eliminated Betito could now compete with the big boys...   There are warring families of course: Rivas, Alibertos and the Phoenix equivalent to that gigantic new arena thing they built for the Dallas Cowboys: FILIBERTOS. dun DUN DUNNNNNNNNNNNN! I suspect Betito will defeat them all though, by sheer intellect and cunning. VIVA BETITOS!  Now, Betito has some work to do, if you will consult this graph I've compiled... ... Oh! I've just learned that I cannot upload spreadsheets to a YELP review... What is this world coming to?  Betitos Items that are better than Fili b's or Rivas - Carnitas Tacos - Carne Asada burrito - Patron burrito - All breakfast burritos - Enchiladas (cheese) - Arizona burrito  Betitos Items that need improvement or fail to other local restaurants of similar competition. - Rolled tacos (taquitos) - Super nachos - Beef tacos - Chicken products  ( I understand that most of these foods may or may not be "chicken" or "beef" or whatever but I suspect it doesn't matter as you are probably drunk )  - The End ???

Matt's Big Breakfast is located in a little building on the corner of 1st Street and Garfield. It is always packed and if you don't arrive before roughly 9AM you will wait for a table. Luckily we were able to get the last table on a recent Saturday. It is at this moment that our luck ran out.  I have said this before: there are only a handful of breakfast spots in downtown Phoenix so to hear people tell it, this is the greatest breakfast place in the world. However, this analysis is false, the breakfast is average at best and is elevated in lieu of other options.   There is parking located behind the building and all along the streets. At various times a song would come on the speakers inside and drown out the chatter, and then silence for 10 minutes. Maybe we came on an off day.  Perhaps someone can help me with something, I ordered the hash browns and they tasted as if they were smothered in vanilla or something sweet. This was immediately off-putting and I could not tell if this was intended but it ruined the whole experience. I did like the jam they served with the sourdough toast, it was probably the best part of the meal.  Ordinarily I would ask a server about this strange flavor choice for the hash browns but it was so incredibly busy that waiting 10 minutes for a water refill seemed to signal to me that I should just move on with my day.  I tried the salami scramble and there massive chunks of sopressata haphazardly tossed in a mountain of eggs. It came with potatoes on the side, they were tasteless and I couldn't finish them.   I may return to try their lunch menu at some point but I will not eat breakfast here again unless forced to.

They've got the hot dogs. You want the hot dogs. This is where you get the hot dogs downtown!   Unfortunately the hot dogs do not taste very good and that is putting it politely. I have tried several variations including the chicago dog and the moki and each time i am less than thrilled.  Per their website: "At Short Leash Hotdogs our mission is to create a unique twist on a classic favorite".  I think this is part of the problem; No one asked for a hot dog served in naan bread, it's strange and unwelcome. The issue for me is the ratio of naan to hot dog, it is completely and utterly out of whack. The dogs themselves (you can choose between beef/brat etc...) are small, particularly when placed at the bottom of a parachute-sized naan.  I recently gave the chicago dog another shot. Their food truck was situated at Hance park for an event. I was let down again, I was also figuratively let down as all of the toppings fell out of the naan as I picked it up to take a bite. It seems to me that they just don't really try that hard and it shows in the food.   The staff is always polite and the actual restaurant is in a good location on Roosevelt Row but I think the concept is where they went wrong. I will not eat there again, there are far better options in the area.

Aioli catered our wedding in January and they did a fantastic job. We had tried the truck a few times at various food events and when it came time to choose a truck we went with Aioli. I will admit though, that they were not our first choice, we had an absurdly difficult time trying to book a few other trucks but after haphazard communications and insanely high prices that didn't justify what they were offering we turned to Aioli and they came through.  We are not a high maintenance couple and they were overly helpful at every turn, from suggesting menu items to organizing day-of preparations everything was smooth. They were even kind enough to accommodate me changing the time of the event a week before the date!   Another thing that impressed me was their punctuality and meticulous planning, we got married at a residence and they planned to arrive within minutes of the ceremony concluding, I didn't even think to ask about this but I'm glad they did.   If you're considering Aioli for your wedding I can confidently tell you that I plan to use them for my next 3 weddings...

There is a hotel in Montauk, New York called The Surf Lodge, The Montauk restaurant in Scottsdale has attempted to recreate this mecca of lobster rolls, music and young Hamptons-cool-vibe. The main issue I have (despite the service, which I will get to in a moment) is that they have taken a very great idea and turned it into a boring Scottsdale restaurant.  I brought a group of friends here to pre-game and have dinner before going out for an evening, enthralled at the idea that someone could recreate the magic of the surf lodge. We were let down at every turn, from the blaring top 40 music to the nearly pitch-black lighting the whole ordeal was bewildering.   It was a Saturday night but very few people seemed to be eating as I made numerous strolls through the place to check out the decor and vibe. Despite this, it still took about 45 minutes for our food to get to the table, terribly slow.   I got to try a number of different items and was thoroughly unimpressed by all of them, particularly my cold lobster roll. I'm not sure what type of lobster they use here but they include a gigantic side-portion of butter, presumably so that you can eat the thing.   I think that with some changes this could be a nice restaurant but the concept doesn't make sense to me, it is the restaurant equivalent of a bait and switch.

I have been scouring the valley for a decent lobster roll after a recent trip to the Hamptons and luckily my quest has finally proved fruitful.   Walrus & The Pearl is a small food counter within the Desoto Market on Roosevelt Row. I don't know how long it's been operating but I'm happy to have found it. We hopped on our bikes and rode over immediately after coming upon a rumor that there was a fantastic oyster bar here.  We tried several oysters, they range from 2-3.25 and are flown in daily. They are served with lemon and some mignonette. It's a small menu, oysters, bubbly, wine and a few other rotating dishes.   The wild north Atlantic lobster roll was perfection, spicy, delicious but a little small. The person working the counter let us in on a tip: on Friday's the lobster roll goes for 8$. This is an unbelievable price and I will be stopping here weekly before setting off on a downtown adventure.   We also tried the spicy yellowfin tuna tartare which is served with a miso sauce. I wish that more places would emulate this lobster roll and not try to fancy them up with unneeded twists that no one is asking for. I realize this is more of an east coast sandwich but I'm glad that someone is getting it right.

Valley bar is the next evolution in a downtown bar/music venue/multi-use space (well, to Phoenix). It is located on Monroe in downtown Phoenix across the street from Seamus Mccafrey's. Situated in in alley there is usually a reasonably formed line to get in, do not be discouraged though, the function of the line is not to weed out the losers but rather to keep the occupancy in check as the place is situated in a basement (a very large basement). Be cool and you will be fine.  There is so much going on here it can be easy to miss stuff, there is a large area where bands or DJ's play called the dance hall, there is also a satellite bar in this room, the main bar area has seating for food, further towards the west end there are 2 pool tables, ski-ball, shuffleboard, board games, and 2 small restrooms.   Smokers, you have to go up the stairs and exit the building to smoke but you do not have to get back in line, you are herded into a little smokers pen, it is a little odd.   The Rose reading room is behind a gray door in the main bar area (southwest corner of the room) and is a nice respite from the madness in the bar. Sometimes people book the room and sometimes the door is locked, I've been told that this is under the discretion of the security staff. On New Year's Eve a magician performed in this little room, since then I have been very cynical about "magic" and I blame this guy for butchering his grand finale trick.  There are shows, chess nights, literary functions and plenty of other events night-to-night.

The Kettle Black is a new restaurant that recently opened on 1st street in downtown Phoenix. When I initially saw the menu and photos of the place I was excited to try it out. I thought it would be a nice addition to the restaurants in the area.  Unfortunately I was not impressed with anything here. The staff was very nice and the atmosphere was accommodating but I found the food and vibe to be extraordinary boring. I think a more succinct way to summarize this restaurant is: generic. There is nothing particularly interesting or different about this place, which means I will not go back.  We visited on a Thursday night and the place was surprisingly busy. There were only a few tables available which I took as a good sign. The music was... strange. I heard several 90's alternative techno remixes, this is a detail that may or may not be useful to you (it certainly is to me).  I can overlook a restaurant being boring or uninspired if the food is really good, however, this was a let-down also. I ordered the 1st Street Burger, it was served on a small cutting board... I'm not sure why, this "fun" idea became immediately impractical as I had to contain all of the drippings on a very small/localized area. The burger itself reminded me of something you would order at a chain restaurant such as a Chilli's or Applebees and that may be the crowd they're targeting with their proximity to the stadium.   The one bright spot were the truffle fries, if I were 4-5 drinks in I may be convinced to return for another round of these.   The Kettle is Whack, stay away.

The newly opened Stacy's Pampered Pig is a must visit. I have yet to find a quality BBQ joint in the downtown area but I have not been entirely adventurous in this endeavor. I have had some odd luck with the BBQ places around the downtown area: they're either tucked away on an inconvenient corner or out of food whenever I call to order (right?).  The restaurant is tucked away on the SE corner of 7th AVE and Osborn (in the old Hideaway Lounge spot), it's in the same complex as the perennially average Mexican restaurant: Mi Patio. We came in on a Friday night and the place was empty, completely empty actually. The lighting was bad and the space looked completely unfinished, none of this is relevant though because the food is excellent.  We waited about 45 minutes for our order (call ahead if you're ordering fried chicken) but it was well worth it.   I suggest the cowboy beans, brisket (I've had better but it was OK), the fried chicken, even the cornbread was fantastic. I hope that this restaurant stays around for a while because they are very good at what they're doing.   I will definitely return in the near-future.
