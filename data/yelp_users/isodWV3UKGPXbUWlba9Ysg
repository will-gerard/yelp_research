This is by far the best restaurant and dining experience your money can buy.  If you are looking for food, service, and consistency this is it.  Top picks; Appetizer Thai Tuna Roll sushi AMAZING!!!  The roast beef sandwich, fish sandwich, and chicken sandwich will always make you satisfied.  If you are looking for the BEST steak in town order the New York.  Really we are foodies and this is the best NY. The service is impeccable.  The staff all works together as a team so your table is clean and you have everything you need.

We went for our 5 year wedding anniversary. We had been several times before and the food was memorable. This evening it was nothing like our previous experience. The dishes were all lacking flavor. I ordered the ravioli which I was so looking forward to and I was extremely disappointed. It was lacking flavor and was no where near the tasty dish I remembered from before. We also ordered the clam and muddle appetizer which tasted like rubber doused in water. We left spending $150 and wishing we went to Hillstone or another restaurant for our special evening out.

I really like this place. They have an array of items changing all the time. The prices are reasonable. I have been very happy with my experience here and I have purchased many items and different times.

Great service. The food was very heavy. We felt like we just gained 20pounds. Not fantastic. We r full in a bad way. Unsatisfied. The food looked appetizing. Menu looked appealing but food did not taste good.

It looks better than it tastes.  No amazing combination that makes me say I have to go back there for that burger. The onion rings were good that was the only item that was good. Frozen burger patty. Nothing special. Costs as much as a burger at Hillstone but no where near the quality. The restaurant is also very dirty. It serves the hangover late night crowd who does not notice the dirt. Our thoughts.

YIPPIE!!!! Our new family favorite restaurant.  We are now eating her about once a week.  They close currently at 6pm so call ahead if you are running late or keep that in mind.  It is a mix between a Mexican & BBQ restaurant.  Their salsa and homemade BBQ sauces are so delicious.  I recommend the Steak Burrito with Green Chili Sauce.  You can order the salsa in different sizes to take home to enjoy.  This is a small family run place.  It is not open Sunday.  Saturday they cook special bone in RIBS.  That is the only day to get the ribs.  They do not have restrooms unfortunately but who cares the food is AMAZING and the price is unbeatable.  I HIGHLY suggest trying it out you will be so happy you found this place!!!!!
