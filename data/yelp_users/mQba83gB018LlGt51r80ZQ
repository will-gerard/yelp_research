Another great spot on the McDowell Mexican Food Expressway.  The other reviewers were dead-on and I appreciate the Yelp community for getting me prepped for waiting times.  I will agree and state that it is totally worth the wait - I had two enchiladas in red suace - one machaca and one pollo.  They were both excellent and I would highly recommend them to anyone.  It is slightly annoying that the chips have a cost, but seriously it's just a buck!  The salsa totally makes it worth it as well - I think the red salsa there is some of the best I've had in recent times.  The atmosphere was great.  There was a little cantina towards the back and the place was a lot bigger and nicer than I was expecting.  That pesky service is the only thing that keeps Rosita's from making the leap to great from good.  As I said, if you head in assuming things may take a while, not so bad; but I could see that becoming a problem in time-sensitive situations like lunch.  One last quick tip - they don't split the bill, so make sure people in your party have cash or owe money to the person who ends up paying with the card.

OK ok ok.  I'll have to agree with some of the below reviewers that this place isn't dead-on authentic Mexican food.  That being said, I love it!  The place is huge, sporting a bakery (said many times before) with unbelievably dirt cheap pastries (not said as many times before), a little carniceria (not as good as Carniceria Sonora) and a huge dining area.    The dining area with all its painted mural glory is so goddamn cool that I find myself wanting to just hang out there for hours watching La Primera Division de Mexico on TV and enjoying a nice $2 Dos Equis.    The food - that's probably the only tougher part.  Keep in mind it's still pretty good, but there are better places in the area for getting your Mexican on food wise.  The potato taco is worth getting because it's fairly unique, but it came out so soggy that I had to eat it with a fork.  I grabbed a couple of the Yelp-Advertised taquitos as well - keep in mind these are not the Circle K, rolling taquitos.  They are literally just smaller tacos, but they were damn good.  I guess when it comes down to it, I'm an atmosphere buff.  There were so many cool things to check out in this multi-plex, and the atmosphere was so warm that I'd love to head back again soon.

Thank you yet again Yelp, for hooking me up with this excellent restaurant. Coronado Cafe is absolutely the definition of quaint. Built inside a humble, antiquated house, and populated with both an excellent selection of wine and beers, Coronado Cafe makes for a great spot for a surprise weekend date.   Making it there just 30 minutes before close, I was a bit worried we'd miss out on the freshest food, or the best recommendations. I was wrong on both accounts. When our very friendly waiter came around, he offered the crusted rock fish as a special. Although many other items looked tantalizing on the menu, both the lady and I jumped on the opportunity.   The fish came out perfect, with just the right amount of crunch, and being cooked well enough to have no questions it was done without drying it out. The rice and mashed potatoes served with it complimented it perfectly.   All in all it was a wonderful experience. I am glad that Yelp has made this place accessible to people who don't live in the area!

I gotta say, I was honestly going to rate this place at three stars until I read Abe S's review and was reminded that Los Taquitos is definitely solid.  He's dead on - although there are better tacos in Phoenix (ie - the McDowell Taco Corridor!), Los Taquitos does a great job and has food that's just...well...good!  I always go with a carne asada taco and a tostada.  The tostada was awesome.  It was literally like six inches tall with lettuce, delicious meat, beans, and cheesy goodness.    The taco was good too, but as I mentioned, there are a few places out there that are tough to beat.  The shop is definitely nice, and it's in a really nice area too which is a rare plus for me.  Everyone was super friendly, and I would definitely go back should I be in the area.

Pupusas?? As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.  I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now.    Salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.  The restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)  The only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a "Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!"  On a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  I'd love to try the Ceviche, as it's on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing.

Phenomenal, cheap, fast hangover food.  This place totally reminds of a diner that you would see in a tiny little town where everyone knows each other.  The servers are friendly, there are lots of options for different egg substitutes, and the service is quick.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who woke up in a random apartment in Old Town, and needs some food quick!  One quick reminder though - be sure to bring your check book or cash!!  They do not take credit.

Jolta Java is a place that was suggested to me by an interview I was conducting for my last job, and I'm really glad that they did.  It's got the perfect atmosphere for anything from reading the NY Times, to studying for some sort of post-graduate placement test, to, as I found out, having an in depth conversation with a person who loves Oracle databases.  The times I've gone here I've had iced coffee, a couple different kinds of Lattes, and of course their regular coffee.  Everything was excellent.  Really the only reason my patronage suffers here now is because I work in No Pho, live in Tempe, and there's almost no scenario that I would be in the area at any time I would drink coffee.  However, if I ever strike it rich and some how inherit a five star resort in North Scottsdale, this will be my new spot.

Another one of my many indie coffee shops that I love to support.  Gold Bar used to be my main spot to interview high-level candidates as a recruiter, and if they appreciated locally-owned business (which a lot of them did!) they were impressed by the selection.  The coffee is great, I'll be honest I'm much more about the ambiance than the expresso itself, and this is probably the most unique in that regard that I've found.    I will agree with another reviewer that the prices are a little higher than most places, even for just plain old coffee, but for a place offering live entertainment etc, it's well worth it!

I love this place!  Super authentic with reasonable prices.  Our Sunday Funday shennanigans have made this a near-weekly destination.    There's a wide selection of different marinated meats, and the Pechuga and Ranchera are the best ways to go for a little daytime grilling.  Add in some AMAZING homemade guac, EXTREMELY spicey salsa, and a friendly staff that isn't afraid to poke fun at wearing an Argentina jersey to their store on the same day they beat Mexico and you've got a winning combination.

Camilo O does a great job of summing up Salazar Brothers, it just doesn't exemplify how much better the food is than F-B's.  The food here is unbelievably cheap, and is made very quickly.  More importantly it tastes great as well.  I usually go with the Chicken Tostada when I go here.  I used to always grab a taco or two to go along with it (also quite good), but after having leftovers every time I've found that unless I'm starving, the ridulously-cheap $2.15 tostada is totally sufficient.  Two bucks for a huge heaping pile of lettuce, salsa, chicken, and beans!  The environment is just like any other quick-stop Mexican shop, not quite as clean cut as Los Taquitos but not bad by any means.  If you're in the area it's probably the best spot around to grab a bite and run!

NOTE: For this review, I'm getting in touch with my roots as a Madisonian, not a transplant to "Mexican Food Heaven" Phoenix, AZ.  Casa de Lara can be a little pricey, but the quality of the food and drinks are definitely worth it.  I am a bigger fan of CDL than Frida's up the street (which is also decent) because I love the unassuming exterior and the authentic feel to the restaurant.  The food choices are very much within the lines of an Americanized joint, but it's prepared immaculately and every dish is full of flavor.  When visiting, I usually take the opportunity to deviate from traditional food and grab the Western Burrito which is HUGE. I usually finish it even though I feel like I'm about to explode.  The margaritas are surprisingly strong - especially when you split a pitcher with someone special, and they usually have reasonable prices if you stick with the olde school Lime on the rocks.

God how I miss this place!  Any time I'm visiting home on State Street I'll get my caffeine fix here.  It's the perfect atmosphere to get some studying done, grab a cup of coffee if you're in a hurry, or have long, intellectual conversations about whether or not American's can be persuaded to change milk brands because of TV-induced fear.    The environment is cozy and dark, but not to the point where you'll find people passed out  face down in their books.  The coffee is excellent and they have a lot of choices at very reasonable prices.  They should hold coffeeshop owner conferences here to spread the good word on how it's done!

Definitely an interesting little place up in North Phoenix, La Oaxaquena hovers between a three and a four, but closer to four.  I stopped in for lunch and was shocked to see that there was not a single soul in there except for me.  What the heck??    The classic unassuming strip-mall Mexican place, the interior was much bigger than normal and the colors were interesting but I thought they added a nice touch.  The cashier / server girl was really friendly and service was SUPER fast.  On to the food - I went with the lunch special of a taco and tostada for $4.95 (what a steal!).  I was assuming when I requested chicken that both items would have chicken on them - something to keep in mind.  The taco was excellent!  A crunchy shell housed deliciously tender chicken, and fresh lettuce and tomato on top.  The tostada was OK, but I think that has way more to do with the fact that I'm not a huge refried beans fan.  Oh, and the chips and salsa were some of the best complimentary additions I've had.  As Daren C. mentioned, $5.35 total will get you some good food, and you'll leave stuffed and ready to pass out in the afternoon of your job.

This is one of those little Deli's that you will see all over the place near large corporate office buildings (ahem, Liberty Mutual, ahem).    I've had really good experiences with a lot of these in the past.  They generally have surprisingly good food for pandering to the "I forgot my lunch and don't want to waste half of it driving" crowd.  Unfortunately this is not one of them.  They do have a few tolerable sandwiches - the French Dip and the BBQ steak sandwiches are not bad.  However, anything with poultry is likely to leave you disappointed at the quality of the deli lunch meat.    The lady who works there is SUPER nice and is always willing to help with a smile, but I just can't ever justify heading here except when I forget my lunch.

My expectations were definitely exceeded here.  After attempting to find a good lunch spot in the area for about 15 minutes (so many on Yelp have closed!) my coworker and I settled in on SteakenBurger.    First off, the place is huge.  I really liked the picnic table style seating, and the fact that they have a few flat screen TV's rocking ESPN - definitely a huge plus.  The prices were really, REALLY reasonable, and you can expect to pay between $3-4 for a good sized burger / sandwich.  On to the food.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and my coworker ordered the Hellzapoppin' burger without giving it much thought other than the fact that it would be spicy.  The buffalo chicken was great, they give you your choice of about 10 different wing sauces for it - honey hot is great.  The sandwich is huge, and the 'small' fries that came with the combo were more than enough (and delicious).  Watching my compadre eat his Hellzapoppin' burger was hilarious.  This burger comes with jalapeños, pepper jack cheese, cayenne pepper, and to top it all off - habanero sauce.  Two bites in and his face was as red as a tomato; four bites in and he was literally sweating.  Hilarious! (For me.)  One other thing to note is that they have happy hour here; although it would be kind of weird rocking pitchers of Bud Lite in a fast-food type environment.  The prices are good, with pitchers running you $6.  If I get any more broke I'll be tempted to give it a shot.

I've been to a few Schlotzky's around the valley and this one is actually surprisingly one of the nicer ones.  It's clean with plenty of space for even the largest working group lunch.  Service comes quick, and they have this southwestern sandwich that is great!  If you're one of the many people who work for a large company on the Dunlap corporate freeway, this is not a bad place to grab a bite before the second half of your work day.  One quick tip - it's kind of tough to find, but it's a stone's throw north of Dunlap on the frontage rd.  You have to go back and around a building to find it though.

This place has to be what Buffalo Wild Wings was like in the 1990's.  I've never seen so many CRT TV's in one spot in my entire life!  I recently stopped by to watch the Suns successfully spank the despised Spurs in the first game of the playoffs, so that alone may add a star to this review.  Once you get past the fact the initial shock of how many TV's there are, the beauty of this place really sets in.  Each Table along the edge has it's own old-school big screen that as mentioned, is 98% likely to be tuned into sports - awesome!  25 oz beers were under $4 and really hit the spot - word to the wise though, don't order a 12 oz right afterwards because when you put the two next to each other, the 12 ozer will make you look super wimpy.  Food was great too - the pizza was some of the best I've had in a bar, and really revived my appreciation for the classic beer/pizza combo!  All in all - great place to catch a game (any game!) and some beer with food that goes good with beer!

I wanted to go here a couple times before giving a definitive review.  My initial gut reaction is that the place is a little pricey for Mexican food, but after going there a couple more times I think the atmosphere and quality definitely warrants the higher price range.  Speaking of atmosphere, this place is great!  That is probably why there is generally a wait on the big-ticket nights, but it's well worth hanging out in the bar for a few drinks.  If you can get a seat at the bar the bartenders will happily let you eat dinner there as well, which is a nice way to skip the wait.  Both times I've been there the live music was a great touch.  It's not uncommon to find a man playing guitar on the super-nice patio, or a full band playing in the main dining area.  Everyone around seems to generally be in a good mood, and the margaritas are definitely good.  I've had the tacos and the fajitas and both were excellent.  Tacos will run you in the $14/15 area, and fajitas are $17 but there was enough food including the beans and rice to take home some leftovers.  I would gladly head back to El Zocalo for grabbing a little Mexican food in a nice atmosphere.  Just don't make the mistake of wearing shorts and a t-shirt with sandals like I did because you'll stick out like a sore thumb!

Ok, I live down the street from Mickey's and I figured that it would be my hot spot for casual drinking.  This is not the case.  Although I hang out with Fred from the dirty occasionally(Wisconsin Guy! Haha..) and he is a big fan; I think that Mickey's is one of the most annoying places to go.  A cover charge, however small, is a ridiculous addition to a place that seems to drain energy from people.  I was about to head there one evening at 1:30am solely to get food, and still would have had to pay a cover!  I think that if the place were a little more upbeat, I would consider returning, but the way that it currently is, I have no desire to return.

It pisses me off how all my friends seem to bring people from out of state to Kona for happy hour.  Why??? It's another large, sub-par chain joint with prices that are comparable to normal, non-HH alcohol prices anywhere that's more than 50 feet from a Louis V store.  I'm just not a fan of patios that extend into a parking garage when you're in Scottsdale and every respectable business has a much better patio.  If you've shopped till you can't walk any further, then yes - Kona is your promised land, but to everyone else - PLEASE stop showing Midwesterners this place like it's some sort of symbol of the Southwest and take them to a  place with character!

I love the Venue!  I had a great time seeing Authority Zero and several reggae-punk bands here.  The drinks were pretty normal as far as Scottsdale pricing goes, but my friends and I stupidly decided to rock the special - which happened to be $3 Sparks black cans.  Cracked out on energy drinks and plenty of pre-party booze, we proceeded to wander around the massive interior which is modeled after a mardi-gras street (I am a sucker for that stuff!) and eventually head into the mosh pit.  I felt like I wanted to die the next day, but there is no other way I would've rather felt!

I used to live right up the street from this restaurant and as a result came here several times.  I don't think that there is any way I'd return though.  I have literally never felt good after eating here - whether it was a hazy, late night encounter and getting sick in the morning, or more of a standard evening dinner and getting sick at night.  Maybe I'm allergic to some sort of special, exclusive ingredient they use...

The four star rating perfectly describes how I feel about Martini Ranch - I'm a fan.  I love the diversity in this place.  Though I'm not very fond of the Shaker Room, I love the fact that they are one of the few places in old town that continue to promote live rock, and somehow I always end up leaving in a blacked-out state.  In fact, I've left my debit card behind the bar twice; having to walk-of-shameingly grab it the next day during daylight.  The service is pretty good even when the bar is packed, and the upstairs patio is an excellent place for me to accidentally smoke against my will.  This is a great place to take midwestern out of towners - with the wide open areas and the mixture of moods.

Oh Totties.  You've saved my life on more than one occasion.  Tottie's is located, quite unfortunately for them, a mere three minute walk from the San Tropez apartment complex.  Why would this be such a curse you might ask?  Because it means that on any given Saturday, there is a very decent chance their hostess will be asked to sit anywhere from 2-11 people after a festive day filled with swimming, margaritas, and sand volleyball who may or may not be still wearing board shorts and bikinis with T-shirts thrown on.  All of that aside, Tottie's is a fantastic place no matter what condition you are in.  All of the servers are amazing and attentive, making sure that your every need is attended to.    The atmosphere is a great balance between a formal and casual dining experience.  There is a bar area that, as Coda B mentioned has several LCD TV's playing whatever the main sporting event is at the time (March Madness right now!).  The atmosphere is darker, and although seems quieter at first, there are pockets of excitement that pop up.  Down to the food.  Tottie's has, hands down, the best Panang I've had in recent memory and I'm a huge curry fan.  The curry sauce is out of this world, causing me to want to get down on my knees and thank my Thai Queen Tottie herself.  The portions are huge for the price, and the Pad Thai and Pad Kra Pao are also excellent.  There aren't a lot of choices for Thai food near Tottie's, but luckily there don't have to be.  Tottie's is the place to be!

This place is freaking awesome!  There's nothing like hanging out on a patio in 80 degree weather after a spring training game getting refreshed from one of the best margaritas in Scottsdale...nothing.    Everything aside, the margaritas were freaking awesome.  My buddy Chris R and I conducted a skateboard margarita tour of Scottsdale one Saturday, and I've gotta say that Frank and Lupe's were definitely near the top.  Their patio is to die for.  I would rather wait for an outdoor table for an hour than be immediately seated inside.    The food - as a previous reviewer said it's on par with similar "gringo" Mexican places; not bad but not what you target on a quest for authentic.  The service has been slow at times, but for the most part I've never had any issue.  I look forward to every opportunity to return to this refreshing break from the Scottsdale norm!!

Lo siento Texano's!  Quieria te gusto mucho, pero you didn't treat me right.  You have too much competition in the taco shop circuit to get along by your interesting looks alone.  Between a sloppy tostada with tons of fatty dark meat chicken, and an overcooked carne asada California burrito, I just wasn't impressed.  This was one of those taco shops that I drove by and went 'oh my God...I am going to love that place!'  When I went inside I thought "oh my God...I am going to love this place."  When I got my food I thought "oh my God, I am not a huge fan of this place."  Final thought - It would have been three stars if the Jukebox would have let me spend a dollar and play the Mana CD that was on the last page of CDs.  Lo siento Texano's.

1.  Great breakfast food in an easy to get to location after Mill Ave Bars 2.  Super fast service, we literally got our food in about 5 minutes after we bought it 3.  Coffee was solid! 4.  I also got the huevos rancheros and they were excellent.  Salsa was great - I'm definitely going to try the green sauce next / hashbrowns equally as excellent! 5.  Waitress staff was...as described many times below. 6.  I will definitely be returning to Harlow's after obtaining my next hangover!

I'm not normally a huge fan of reviewing chain businesses, but after checking in and perusing the reviews for this Dunkin' I couldn't help but jump in.  I live a stone's throw away, and as a result it has become a fixture of mine on my way to North Phoenix for work.  The lines are definitely scary in the morning, but much to my surprise they move a lot quicker than I would think.  Despite the vast number of people, the super friendly employees have memorized my drink, and always help out with a smile.    Thank you DD for jerking me into consciousness in the morning!

The woodshed was a surprisingly nice place.  We stopped by on our Tempe Dive Bar Tour, and I actually found it to be the most aesthetically pleasing, although it was one of the last stops so there may have been some drunk goggles going on.  At the time we were there they had $3.25 32oz domestics which is a pretty damn good deal.  There is a narrow bar area, and some other seating area around with the normal realm of darts, pool, and other bar games.  People are friendly and service is pretty quick.  I didn't eat any of the food, but I wouldn't be surprised if I found myself in this bar again.

In case you were wondering if Kate T's comment about free drinks with Packer touchdowns is still true, I can assure you that it is.  Just think about a 6 touchdown rout over the Giants....six drinks per person!   The Laurel has a good selection of tap beers, a decent amount of bar food apps, and I've heard their fish fry Fridays are amazing and cheap.   The only drawback is that the bartenders basically need to be smacked in order to notice you unless you already know them. It felt as though they really didn't want me to drink, which stands directly in contrast to what I want while watching a do or die Packer game.   If you live in the area, or if the packers are playing a weak team, come here. It will be worth your while!

AZ 88 is a great date location.  The atmosphere is excellent - always an artistic display, usually great music.  If my parents ever make it out here from Wisconsin, I'm definitely taking them to AZ 88.  The view of the Scottsdale mall is really cool, and the proximity to a number of the "old" Old Town bars is really convenient.  The food is reasonably priced, with most sandwiches and dishes right around $10.  They have a good sized bar selection, with some really interesting imported beers.  I would absolutely recommend the AZ 88 sandwich if you enjoy buffalo sauce, and it's really hard for me to not order the little crackers with onions and bacon on them (even despite disliking bacon!).

I loooove Pita Jungle!  Their food is incredible and healthy - a rare treat these days.  The hummus that kicks things off is some of the best I've ever had.  I've stuck to a few dishes including the Chicken Masala and the  black bean burger (I'm not a vegetarian, but I prefer it to real burgers now!).  I have yet to find hippy health food that compares.  The servers are always really nice and attentive, and best of all it's fairly cheap.  I would definitely eat here every day if there was one closer to old town!

This is my favorite place to catch a show hands down.  The outdoor venue is the pinnacle of why I moved to Arizona.  The soft grass, great sound, and excellent bands mesh together like a mini Edge Fest.  The only thing I could do without would be the Festival Prices of the drinks.  Mesa Amp gets great bands, and I can't wait to see another show there soon.

I never thought I would find myself saying this, but I'm a fan of Loco Patron.  For some reason, and not to discredit Fred M., every time I've stopped by this place has been jammed.  It's especially great during spring training, as everyone's looking for an ice cold margarita to cool down after paying $8 for beers at the Giants stadium.  Service is usually pretty quick, even when the bar is packed.  That can be really tough to do and so few bars do it well.  The only downside is having a tough time finding a place to sit.  In fact, I'm not sure that I've ever even taken a seat in this bar.  My 'glass is half full' side tells me that at least you get to work the legs out a bit.  I've never eaten here so I can't comment on the food.  I often forget that people are even there to eat until I'm stumbling past their tables on the way to another bar.  Maybe some day I'll relax and grab a bite here to comment on that aspect.

I went to Chaser's to see my friends' band Comfort for Change perform.  I was not too excited upon arriving at the venue to see that it was lodged in a run down strip mall, but was pleasantly surprised.  I think that live music has a way of making any place better for me, but the bar had plenty of room, and definitely an interesting mix of the usual scene kids and some more local-looking bar crowd.  The acoustics were fine, the drinks were pretty cheap, and I found myself heading to some random house party afterwards.  Rock on!

Not a ton I can add that hasn't already been covered.  This place is suhweeeeeeet!  When you make reservations, which you should definitely do, make sure to request the patio.  It's spacious and although I get colder faster than any Phoenix native, I was fine even in early February weather.  The food was phenomenal - I had the Tilapia and my lovely companion had some sort of stuffed chicken deal that was too complicated for me to figure out.   The drinks are strong for being in a restaurant - a huge plus for me.  The mojito is definitely worth a shot.    Take great food, a great atmosphere, attentive wait staff, and throw in a guy playing acoustic covers of slower indie songs (think Decemberists) and you've got a winning combination!

Chris R and I were two diehard football fans traversing the bowels of sports bars in the Phoenix area.  Made soft by previous seasons of DirecTV with limitless 30 packs of Coors Light, cheap homemade food, and plenty of room to stretch out in front of multiple big screen TV's, we had it made.    Bam! Flash forward to two leases in five months, a lack of big dolla finances, and we find ourselves out on the DirecTV sports-packageless streets. Enter Boston's:  $4 32 oz beers, $5 filling appetizers, an open neighborhood bar atmosphere, and hyper friendly servers. The chairs, while they do seem like they were purchased at a garage sale, are incredibly comfortable and lean back for easy viewing of the 'wall of sports tvs.'   I've never been here without a sporting event on, but there are no sports bars as comfortable in the Tempe area. Thank you for saving us Boston's!!

This is my coffee joint!  When I wake up in the mornings I either have a thrift mentality where I drink my god-awful office coffee, or a "I don't care that I'm completely going broke" mentality where I head to D'lish.  I would say that I fall into the latter category most days of the week.  Everyone on the staff totally rocks.  I usually hate my entire life and everything in it at 7:00 when I roll through there, but I always drive away with excellent coffee in hand and as much of a smile as possible on my face.  The prices are totally reasonable, and although I'd be irritated about the fact that they have UoP propaganda all over their cups, I find myself wanting to support them and have whoever started this wonderful business to make millions and millions of dollars.  Like some fellow reviewers I would definitely recommend the Chicken Pesto Sandwich.  I generally stick with regular coffee in the morning, but every espresso drink I've had has been phenomenal as well.  Thank you D'lish for making M-F tolerable!

I used to hit the Tavern up pretty much every time I was on Mill, but looking back I'm not really sure why.  It's not terrible, don't get me wrong, it's just that for almost every purpose there is a better spot to go.  Patio, dance floor, strength of cocktails, and interesting people - within one mile you can find a place that will suit you better.    The thing that's nice about the Tavern is that it's generally less crowded than everything else along the ASU party corridor.  It's also located right off the light rail which is really convenient for jumping off and grabbing a quick drink.  The back patio is cool, but gets PACKED so it can be tough to find a spot to sit and chill, and the front patio has so many smokers that you feel like you might as well just start smoking yourself and at least get a buzz on.  Meh - go here if you have a big group of friends going but not worth it without good people.

I've been to this little gem two times now and would love to recommend it to anyone!  The one thing I will say is that while a lot of the standard Mexican dishes are on the menu, they definitely have a different feel than most, even authentic, Mexican restaurants.  I have ordered the Huaraches and the Quesadillas and they were both excellent.    All of their dishes are served in a green sauce, which I could see some people being more excited about than others.  Keep in mind the sauce is delicious, as is their salsa verde which comes complimentary with some chips before your meal.  All in all, with the excellent and helpful wait staff, this place was great.  The only thing that keeps it from five stars is the fact that the dishes seem similar as they all come fried and served in the sauce.

There are quite a few wordy reviews here for the Grig, and I think that it's important for someone who went into this lease with no delusions to weigh in on this magnificent marvel of marketing and excess.    First, the stereotypes:  It is a really young complex: YES People party at the pool on weeknights: YES It is really expensive: YES Everyone is a rich brat: NOT NECESSARILY Neighbors are loud and inconsiderate: NO The complex is really social: SOMETIMES Everything is really nice: YES Close enough to walk to the bars: ONLY IF YOU HAVE NO GIRLS  Boiled down, if you can afford the Grigio, and are mentally under the age of 30, the Grigio is amazing.  The gym is huge, the lake path is right there, the rooftop deck is inspiring, the vast number of pool view apartments is staggering, and the garage parking is something I truly, truly miss now that I've moved out.  They just upgraded the cable to digital DVR boxes and super-fast internet, and the people in the office are great - if UPS delivers your package to the office, they will call you and offer to drop it in your apartment!  Amazing.   Bottom line, if you have the money and don't mind hearing Lady Gaga occasionally at 11:00pm from the pool - move in today!

Way to go Center for Gentle Dentistry!  One of the worst aspects of moving to a new city is finding a new dentist.  They are typically under-reviewed on websites like this, and ones specifically aimed at dentistry always seem to cost money (ridiculous!)    I am pleased to announce that I will be heading to Dr. Chatterjee until the day that I either move far away or lose all of my teeth and only have to go to Walgreens for an update on Denture Adhesive.  I am not what you would say, a dentist enthusiast.  I resent going there, and if not for Bonnie's gentle reminder phone calls Theres a decent chance that I would have missed all of my appointments.  Procedures are painless, I will admit I had a cavity or two and Dr. Chatterjee and her staff were really conscious of my fear.  The procedures were over in a snap too.  I've had two dental insurance companies with the Center for Gentle Dentistry, and they took both and fought for pre-auth's when necessary.  I would highly recommend Ms. Chatterjee!

The clubhouse definitely rocks.  I have seen some great local music as well as some bands that take me back (think Lagwagon!)  The bar is set up perfectly, and it's easy to pound your drink and head out into the pit.  The last time I was there I was partying with my boss (an ex punker himself) and we both ended up stage diving - a feat I haven't accomplished in ages.  I had a great time and would definitely head back there many times to come.

So, I frequented Yucca tap on my Saturday Dive Bar Tour and I have a sneaking suspicion it would be quite different if I stumbled in on a Saturday evening rather than around 2pm.  This suspicion is due to a combination of hearsay from friends, other reviews, and walking past the front doors to grab some Shisha from the neighboring smoke shop around 10pm.  For that last scenario, there was not one time in which I felt confident I would NOT be smacked in the head by a stray beer bottle.  I love the live music, there are so few places in Tempe where you can see some rock and roll without having to fork out $20 and know every lyric.  That's why even though I haven't had the pleasure of rocking out to some live music here myself, I'm reviewing high in anticipation and Yucca will have to mess it up to get an updated, lower review.  The place is really pretty small during the day, and dark as all hell.  I had trouble seeing when I first walked in.  The bartender was pretty cool, and prices were cheap - so cheap that when Chris R. asked about whether there were any specials going on, the bartender just replied 'no specials, we just sell everything cheap.'  Perfect.

A cool place - really glad Yelp helped me find this little gem. As many have mentioned before me, the ambiance is outstanding with a secluded patio and a large fireplace that steals the show. I wish they had live music when I was there because that would have been even more amazing.   The service was fast and attentive, and it's incredible how you can snag a spot next to the fireplace, even on a Friday night. We went with the bruschetta plate and a delicious Uruguayan sandwich. All of the food was seasoned excellently and very filling for the price. The chips that come with the sandwiches are not a greasy pile of potato chips, but rather broken pita chips which was a really nice touch.   It's a little out of the way for us east siders, but I will most definitely be back!

This place is great!  I'm definitely looking to head back here soon.  I think it's really funny how the reviewers talk about snobby barristas - there's definitely an attitude but those reviewers need to work on their self-confidence because it's actually pretty funny.  There's nothing like ordering a non-fat latte and hearing, 'next time you really need to order it with at least 2%, none of that skim bull****.'  So true and so enlightening!  Skim or no skim the latte was bomb and I'm really pumped to go back for more.  Prices are reasonable, and the place has almost a warehouse type vibe going on, with plenty of seating for all of the iPad-toting workaholics.  One last tip - the place is super tough to find, it's behind the little Ash strip mall that has Pollo Supremo in it.  I'll definitely be back!

The time has finally come to review Solo Cafe.  I've been here quite a few times, and every time that I return I get a more and more positive feeling about it.  I plan to update this review after another number of months and see if I can get it to five stars, but here's what got it to four so far:  * Lots of people studying - a great place to go if you're like me and prefer the communal suffering of a busy studying environment. * As many people have mentioned - the wifi * Grunge music - kind of random for a coffee shop but suits this one well * Friendly, but not overly bubbly, barristas who know a ton not only about their own coffee, but the local importers and competitors * Reasonable prices * and last but not least - the cool murals on the wall  Solo Cafe is definitely the best coffee shop in that Southern Tempe area.  If you work in the Autoplex or AZ Mills - stop by here for sure!

Wow!  I can't believe the reviews for Pearl that I'm seeing.  I originally stopped by this fine establishment due to it's proximity to where I work and the advertisement of ridiculous specials; but I have found it to be one of my favorite happy hour spots in Scottsdale.  First, the progressive percent off idea is excellent and cheap simultaneously.  Plus, it's 50% off from 10-12 on Saturday nights!  The sushi I've had has been up to par, and the service from Tammy - the lead bartender behind the counter - and her associates has always been excellent.  The only thing that I would change would be the amount of space inside; but now that the weather is getting better it is much less of an issue.  If you like sushi, and are in a pinch for cash, definitely check this place out!

I was very impressed and surprised by the quality of this restaurant!  This place is STYLISH - whether it's the plush lounge chairs on the patio, or the old school movies being projected on the walls - there's definitely an element of class that is rare for the Mill Avenue district.  First impressions were extremely positive - the place was busy but not packed, candlelit tables, and dim lighting provides the perfect atmosphere for a date, but not too much so that it causes that uncomfortable, formal, anxiety feeling.  La Bocca almost seems like an AZ88 in Tempe for those who are fans.    I was pleasantly surprised at the prices on the menu.  Most items were in the $10-15 range, and I was immediately intrigued by the various pizza selections.  I focused my sights on the garden pizza, which took me by surprise because it was basically a chef-tossed salad on a really good pizza crust.  My girlfriend went with the bruschetta planks and chose two homemade pesto, one mozarella basil, and one roasted artichoke - DELICIOUS!  Top that off with a few glasses of really good sangria and you've got a really good meal for right around the $40-50 mark.  Needless to say we will be returning!

It pains me to review a place with one star, especially when it is locally owned and the owner is easily accessible by working in the establishment.  That being said, I am pleased to offer my one-star review for Harem.  This place starts out very intriguing.  The ambiance looks phenomenal, a very dark place with a great patio that faces hoards of middle school kids killing time on a Friday night.  I've strangely found that every time I go there, the music gets cranked up about 15 notches to the point where conversation becomes extremely difficult...not a good aspect of a hookah bar.  From there it gets worse.  The hookah is very expensive (especially compared to some of my local Tempe joints, and on top of that, there is a one drink minimum.  However, the way that you are notified about this is ridiculous.  My group ordered three coffees, a latte, and five waters.  When we were brought five $4 Voss water bottles, we were a little surprised.  Upon inquiring, we were informed that coffee doesn't count as a drink, and rather than ask what our one drink would be, we were brought extremely overpriced water.  It gets worse.  Our coffee took about 25 minutes to be delivered, our charcoal was changed one time, and although the owner apologized for 'the mess,' there was no attempt to rectify it and put us in a position where we wanted to come back.  My advice would be as follows,  1.  Hire more staff if it takes more than 10 minutes to get a cup of coffee on a table 2.  Turn the damn music down 3.  Make a one drink minimum for people who aren't dropping $25 on average sheesha 4.  Use the proceeds from the $4 waters to put a lock on the bathroom door!!  Unless I see that there are some drastic changes I will not be returning to Harem.

I really really wanted to review this place highly but I just can't.  I went there on a random weekend evening hoping to find another diamond in the rough strip mall restaurant.    When I walked in I was immediately impressed by the decor and general atmosphere.  We were the only ones in the whole restaurant, which was surprising, but it was really nice.  It looked like there was only one guy working as well - he was very nice and offered recommendations so no issues there.  That's about the end of my positive experience though unfortunately.  Service, as nice as the waiter was, was extremely slow.  It took a loooooong time between times when we saw our guy and when you're the only party in the restaurant - not good times.    Needless to say I was really, really excited when the food finally made an appearance.  The disappointment continued though.  I ordered the Curry Goat on the server's recommendation, and there was literally more bone than meat.  The meat that I was able to get was sub-par as well.    All in all, I wouldn't go so far as to warn friends against CF, and I will probably go back at some point to see if things are different, but I was definitely uninspired upon leaving.  Hopefully down the line we'll see a review update that can add a star or two...

After frequenting Salvadoreno #1 in Mesa quite a few times, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a branch located up near where I work in No Pho.  The food was nearly identical - which is a huge plus!  Like others have mentioned on here - the Pupusas are super cheap and are one of my new favorite food items.    The restaurant itself is a step up from the Mesa location though.  While not quite as cozy, it is spacious and really well lit.  As someone who is planning on heading back to school for some Spanish courses (but definitely not remotely fluent yet), it was a little easier to communicate as well.  Now quit reading this and go try some Pupusas!

Woooo boy! Some harsh reviews on the poor little unassuming hookah/gangsta rap hangout known as Crave.   Well allow me to retort. Crave is excellent for what it is - a mish mash of hookah, cheap drinks, and good food specials. It's a great spot to pre drink without dropping a hundred bucks if you're with those annoying friends who feel like they need to go out before 11.   The food specials are solid as well. As Sunny mentioned, five bucks can get you anything from a hummus plate to a quesadilla to a solid sandwich combo. Throw in a couple $2 beers or mixed drink and you've got yourself an excellent post work wind down.   The music selection does get pretty gangsta on the weekends, but if you are just looking to avoid the long lines at Cue or Zuma, and want a cheap drink while you're doing it, Crave is the place to be.   On a side note, I've never lost my card or witnessed anyone puking.

Brackin's is my new favorite day drinking spot.  The bar itself is located perfectly within a tucked-away area in the Old Town Scottsdale mall area.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, and when the owners swing by, they really make an effort to get to know you.  Prices are also very relaxed, with bottled beer landing right around $3 for domestics.  All in all, if you are looking for a spot to hang out with a couple drinks, maybe enjoy some live music, and do some people watching; I would definitely recommend Brackin's.

How the hell did I end up in San Diego?? I was just on the 60!  I was so pumped about Pier 54 that I could barely eat, even though the food was pretty darn good.  Built along the edge of those zig-zaggy man-made lakes in the middle of Tempe, Pier 54 is tucked away from any traffic noise and the hustle and bustle of sprawling Phoenix life.  It's set up as a bar / restaurant combination, with a bar in the middle and seating all around it.  The bar has a couple of TV's mounted (old school non-flat screens!) so you can catch the Suns or the other teams that let Phoenicians down.  The food was good; I wouldn't send an email back home about it but definitely didn't detract from the experience.  I had the Shamu which was a battered cod sandwich.  It was pretty good and although the bun would have left a little to wish for, they toasted it which immediately adds some points - sneaky.  The fries were seasoned and came out hot.  Add the fact that even though we showed up five minutes before their last call takes place at 9:30p, the staff was really friendly and helpful.  They only had two beers on tap, but as previously mentioned one was the Kronenbourg 1664 which is one of my new favorites.  All in all, two sandwiches and a couple beers set us back about $25 bucks.  Not bad considering the area and view.  I'll definitely be returning for both Happy Hour and dinner in the future.

Understated, huge portions, and delicious!  Love Gavin F's first comment - it's so true!  The whole East African Center around the restuarant only adds to the authentic feel.    I headed there on a lazy Saturday to check out this place I've driven by 248 times and my expectations were definitely exceeded.  First glance over the menu shows literally everything listed at $9.  There's a kicker to that which I'll touch on in a moment.  The atmosphere was definitely strange, but didn't detract from the experience.  It was a little weird watching Gladiator on TNT and dining on Northeast themed table coverings (lobster and lighthouses? What the heck??).    I grabbed the curry chicken, which was listed at $9, and did not expect the sheer size of the plate that was to come out.  It was about the size of a Domino's medium pizza and was packed with really good chicken, a small salad, and plenty of rice.  It was so good I couldn't stop eating it, and ended up leaving the place with that classic American, uncomfortably-full feeling.    The icing on the cake was when I went to ring up my chicken and a bottled water - the total was $7!  I must've hit a lunch special on the weekends or something but needless to say I left happy.  Definitely worth a try even if you've never had African food before.

Just when I think that I've finally figured out where my favorite Taco Shop is, Taqueria Yaqui jumps in and has to throw all my game off.    This place is AMAZING.  The meat is some of the best I've had, juicy and tender, fair prices, they take CREDIT, always fun to people watch, and to think that I found this place by accidentally taking the light rail one extra stop to 7th Ave and Camelback rather than Central.    I will be getting my exercise thanks to this place, and the long drunken walks from Rosie's down the street.

I decided to head to Tempe Bicycle after figuring out that a mountain bike I was looking at on Craigslist was stolen property.  Having been fed up with deals that were too good to be true I decided to bite the bullet and head to a place where I knew people would know bikes.  I found the staff to be really helpful at this location.  Everyone who assisted knew a ton about bikes, and showed enthusiasm that I was buying a bike for the first time in years.  The staff directed me towards a lower end bike because I wanted to use it mostly for street biking with an opportunity for some basic trail-riding down the line.  All in all I was very happy with my experience.  They even encourage you to bring the bike back after a month or so for a free tune-up that makes a huge difference.  The only thing to be careful of is to keep in mind the hidden expenses of buying a bike.  I didn't factor in the lock, lights, helmet, and maintenance supplies so definitely save a little more before the big purchase!

What a hidden Gem!  I was definitely a little apprehensive to head in due to the fact that it looks like a church-based coffee shop, but after being re-assured by their description I gave it a whirl and I'm so glad that I did.    The inside to this place is really spacious and they do a great job at making things really comfortable.  It has a dark tone to it, but plenty of tables and comfy looking chairs to sit in.  There's also a stage, and on Friday night there was actually an acoustic duo that played which can add a nice touch.  The coffee was good as well, I had my go-to Skim Latte and it was excellent.  The prices were definitely reasonable, and the fact that they donate all profits to worthy causes is just incredible.  If I still worked in Scottsdale I would no doubt make this a hot spot to frequent.  For the time being, I'll head there for any 'meeting in a coffee shop' type needs.

I can't help but agree with everyone about this place.  I originally wanted to give it four stars, but for being a locally-owned shop the atmosphere was so great that I had to hit five.  I would actually almost consider moving into the apartments next door just so I could walk to this spot.  The coffee was good but man - plenty of couches, some extra rooms for studying, and you've got yourself a winner and possibly the coolest coffee shop for chilling in the Tempe area.

Yup.  The other reviews are dead on about this place.  Cheap, fast, locally owned, and freaking delicious.    Those who are looking to get their food on and are claustrophobic should be careful though, as the main restaurant area is smaller than some walk-in closets I've seen.  There is another section that is a new gelato and juice bar, but it wasn't open at 9p on a Sunday evening.  In total we ordered a chicken parm sandwich, a turkey and provolone sub, some fries, and some of that fabled Leomade I've been hearing about.  First things first, what the hell is up with that Leomade!  It was amazing.  I'm not a big leomade fan, but damn!  The chicken parm was really good too, it had an aftertaste that was almost sweet, and left me wanting more after my modest 6" sub was gone.  Prices were great, especially for food at this caliber.  Fries were only two bucks, and a six inch sub will run you $4, almost as cheap as Subway and twice as good.  Jamie's recipe for success is one part awesome food, one part reasonable prices, one part friendly servers who will joke around and make you feel at home, and one part mysterious leomade.  I'll certainly be seeing you guys again soon.

I am really glad Aliria reviewed this place!  I was literally driving on my way to Danny's car wash for an oil change when I quickly Yelped Lightning Lube and saw her sole review standing proud with four stars.  I will admit that when my phone notified my friends I checked in here, I got a few....questioning...text messages due to the name, but I would gladly head back here any time for an oil change.  I love no-nonsense care places, and the young lady who helped me at the front didn't try and sell me anything extra.  She just let me know that my windshield wipers were all but useless (a fact I've noticed every time we receive a rare rain shower.)  I was so shocked that I wasn't pressured into a $100 transmission flush that I nearly fell over.  The service was really fast and the total came to a very reasonable $30 total - not bad for supporting the little guys against the shady Midas' and Jiffy Lubes'.

Anothing five star from me, two in one day is pretty rare, however Total Wine is my home away from home.  Although their prices are the lowest I've seen (eat their dust Bevmo!), I'm still planning for putting up nearly as much in booze as I do in rent due to the fact that I live a block from this place.    Highlights:  Wine tasting Near limitless section of tequila (and easily the cheapest) Staff picks and top rated wines on the left immediately after entering Helpful staff that won't make you feel like an idiot the first time you buy wine Tons of micro-brews, even the biggest alky could go weeks without having to pick up the same sixer twice.  I'm fortunate to live under a half mile from this place, because there's nowhere I'd rather spend the last $75 in my checking account.

If you are looking for the most authentic Mexican experience in the eastern Phoenix area, this is definitely the place to go.  Be warned, a translator definitely might be necessary!  My amiga and I had this spot recommended because it's one of the few that serve Birria and I would definitely agree on the quality.  Birria is a kind of goat soup that is spiced heavily and served with tortillas.    The restaurant itself is more or less a large room with tables and a cashier stand.  The menu is 90% Spanish, and there were definitely a few things I had never heard of before.  Every time I've gone there I believe I have been the only non-Spanish speaker there, but for the most part everyone is very friendly.  Again, this is not a date-spot or a place to impress anyone (unless they are snobs about traditional Mexican food!), but rather a good place to go to kick it with some Telemundo and delicious food.  One last piece of advice if you're headed there - bring cash!  They definitely don't take credit.

I'm slowly but surely finding some of the good local(ish in this case) business in the northern Phoenix area.  Two Hippies is one of the winners.  First impressions - man this place is small!  A total of five tables is barely enough to hold the lunchtime rush - in fact, people were standing all over the place.  We were lucky enough to snag a table while waiting for our food and we felt like VIPs.  The first impression I had was that the menu was really diverse.  Tacos, burgers, and hot dogs is an interesting combo; but even within those food groups there were a lot of different choices.  Tacos were $2 each or 3/$5 - a great deal given how big they are.  There are a lot of options including chicken, fish, a few types of beef, and even cactus.  The hot dogs included things like feta and pesto mayo.    I ordered the chicken and fish tacos, and to be a little adventurous threw in a cactus taco.  All of them were way bigger than I thought they'd be, and the cactus was amazingly good.  It was sprinkled with some Feta cheese and various other veggies.  Two important things - CASH ONLY and no tax!! $5 is $5 when you rock the Hippy palace.

Contigo Peru is a Peruvian restaurant that recently opened up.  I would characterize it as a spot that is low on atmosphere but high on food.  I've never had Peruvian food before, and at the recommendation of my friend from Peru I went with the Ceviche de Pescado to get acquainted.  The food itself was great - it was prepared quickly and the presentation was great.  Ceviche is cooked fish that is served chilled - definitely not something I'm used to and it took some reassuring from my friend that it was safe to eat.  Once that initial shock passed, I really enjoyed it.  It was spiced with a unique hot sauce that can be added to taste.  The side dishes were two different types of corn from Peru as well - both of which added to the meal and left me satisfied.  All of this was washed down with an ice-cold Inca Cola which I had read about but never had before.  The restaurant is set up as a large, open room.  Not too much to look at, but nice and the Waitress / possibly owner / manager was really attentive and cracked a few jokes at my insistence on spicier food.  All in all I hope this place does well because it can be tough to find authentic South American food in the valley and Contigo Peru does a great job at that!

This place is blowin' up on Yelp and for good reason!  I have a strong desire to knock one star off every review I have for other Mexican spots after eating here.  The salsa bar is fantastic, and with so many choices (upwards around 10!) it was really hard to stick with four or five little cups.  I decided to go kind of random with my taco selections and picked the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco and the Cochinita Pibil - marinated pork.  I seriously think the Cochinita Pibil was the best taco I've ever had, at least north of the border anyway.  The Dogfish Shark taco was very good as well.  I think my search for the best tacos in Phoenix has come to a close!  It's going to be really tough to justify going to another place after this experience.

I hate long lines.  Call me a dive bar brat or tell me that I need to get cooler so I have more friends and get get on lists but I despise waiting in line.  That being said - the line at Robbie Fox's is well worth it!   I was skeptical about the joint the first time I walked in.  I thought, this is going to be another one of those lame, cookie cutter type bars that throw an Irish exterior on and are super boring inside (Tempe Marketplace, ahem.).  Not the case!  I've been here on several evenings and have found the Fox family capable of inducing a super fun time on almost any occasion.  In addition, they were THE spot to be for the World Cup.  I watched both Saturday US games and an Argentina game here and it was a blast.  Totally packed and rivaled the NY bars that were shown on TV.  I had some corn beef hash and it was pretty delicious, and when I asked for a cup of coffee (8am saturday) with as much alcohol as possible in it I got a mouth full of energizing Jameson - perfect!  I had the fortune of meeting Mrs. Owner (Fox?) while she was scrubbing away at the floors and she was super nice - I hope she makes a million dollars from this place.

Yes Mill, yes! I know it's selfish, I really do, but I love the direction you're headed if you get more places like this. Canteen represents the perfect step up from Cue and Tavern for those of us who like to party down but aren't enthralled with the novelty enough to jam into tight spaces. Canteen finally gives a touch of class to a stale bar scene, without needing the cab ride up to Scottsdale or the Biltmore. That's not to say I'm done with the aforementioned bars, but damn does it feel good to have a choice.   Pros: Huge tequila selection Multiple bars Huge patio in the back Decent dance floor inside Drinks aren't thaaaaaat expensive Generally pretty good music  Cons: Always a line, though it does move quickly Back bar is a nightmare to get drinks A line for the mens restroom, what??!

The time has come to slip out of my Reviewless Yelp Coma.  The perfect catelyst for this was Tacos Atoyac.  This place has got it down.  First off, the fish tacos previously discussed were amazing, some of the best I've had.  They rival my long-time favorite spot, La Condesa, and are 1/2 the price!  The fish is plentiful and perfectly battered, and the sauce that comes on them is perfect consistency and taste.    I've had the carne asada tacos as well, definitely hit the higher quality standpoint and I would highly recommend them.  After doing some perusing in the northern Phoenix area (usually on my modest lunch break), I can safely say that this spot will be in regular rotation.  Great prices, excellent food, and a nice patio area pull together for a great package that is going to be tough to beat.    Welcome to the neighborhood, Tacos Atoyac!!

I'm going to take a break from my Yelping hiatus to talk about a relatively new venue that has become near and dear to my heart.  The Crescent Ballroom has become the single greatest concert venue in Phoenix.  Charlie Levy has become my indie god, as he's brought more concerts that I've been stoked about than I could ever imagine in such a short period of time.  The acoustics are perfect, the tickets are nothin', and you can get yo drink on with anything ranging from PBR to handmade gourmet concoctions.  Thank you Crescent!!
