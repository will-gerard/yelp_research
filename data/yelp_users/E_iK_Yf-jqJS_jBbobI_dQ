This place was straight up N.A.S.T.Y.  I am prior military so I have eaten some not so good meals. I'm not a picky person. I think you can pretty much doctor up food to be edible....that was until today! I took one bite of my tostada and I refused to eat anymore. I literally was grossed out and by the time the staff noticed our table, I wasn't even willing to order something else. I was disappointed.

I'm a huge #RideorDie Phoenix Mercury fan. 2012 has been plagued with countless injuries, but the heart of this team never waivers.....neither do I. Not every year is gonna be stellar....but through the good times and the bad...I WILL BE A MERC FAN!!  Count on it!!
