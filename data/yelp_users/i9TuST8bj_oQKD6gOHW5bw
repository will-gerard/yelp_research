This Safeway was first introduced to me by worth of mouth, people always had something wonderful to spotlight throughout the store. The produce department is fresh and appealing, with a friendly produce clerk available to give samples and provide tips to finding the cream of the crop. The meat department, clean and stocked with diverse cuts of meat for any occasion. The bakery department is a gem. Freshly made bread 4/5/6 guaranteed. Deli is your quick stop for those long days, fresh fried chicken, roasted chicken with your classic pairings freshly made. Not looking for fried? How about their in house made salads and sandwiches? You can also make it a deal. Lastly their front end service, with young friendly faces ready to get you on your way. This safeway is the definition of a great neighborhood store. With saving around every corner and available for quick coupon downloads with their J4U app. It's a great way to save and experience their complete delivery of outstanding customer service, where you feel right at home.

Always friendly smiles to ask for your order. Clean fast and fresh. Nothing better than that. Only downside is the long lines inside and in the drive thru.

Among the hidden gems of sushi & fresh Thai food Narai is ranked top on my list. From the friendly courteous servers (Katelyn) to the delicious food that never let's me down. If you're in the market for something new, then id point to Narai.

Upon my arrival to this part of town, I was soon acquainted to this little coffee shop. After my experience at big chain coffee shops, I was surprised at the warmth and friendliness that radiates from every single employee. From Their fresh new menu items (made to order) to their awesome 12 hour happy hour, there is something for everyone even if coffee isn't you cup of tea, they make a tropical green tea that keeps you coming back for more. If there was any higher rating than 5 stars, believe me I'd be clicking them. So I HIGHLY recommend this one of kind coffee shop, a true gem in the North Phoenix Valley.

IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING LIVING HERE, READ THIS:  I lived in different apartments down by 19th Ave and Thunderbird. While there, we found out our neighbors were involved with ISIS (later killed in Texas), place infested with cats, smell of weed every night, cops constantly getting called, shootings, killings, break-ins. You name it. The list goes on and on.   I wanted to express how horrific our old apartment complex was so that YOU are able to grasp my next comment: I WOULD RATHER GO BACK THERE THAN LIVE AT MOTIF (Villas at cave creek).  This is by far the worst apartment complex I've ever lived in. If you're STILL considering moving here, let me tell you what you're in for:   Nice, relaxing - freezing cold showers because the damn boiler had to be replaced AGAIN. (Prepare to not have water for a week or more) Cockroaches, dust worms, dust in general, broken lights, broken doors, drawers falling out, carpet is a disgusting mess (yes, prior to move in), incompetent leasing agents who couldn't care less when you have a complaint or in need of repair.   They're remodeling this place and we had construction for almost two months now in the same units; drills, saws, hammering, yelling, loud music, running up and down the stairs or on the same floor (shakes the damn place) - from 7:30 or 8 AM to 9PM every day. I'm a student and I spend 8-10 hours a day studying (which is why we got a two bedroom apartment to begin with ( 1 is my study area) and we have all of the units around us being remodeling.   I started to go Into our closet in our master bedroom to study because it's the only area with the LEAST amount of noise.  When I called the office to ask if they can shut the doors to the other apartments while tearing the damn place down to minimize the sound, she told me to go to their office and sit in the "business" area or by where the TV is to study. OR better yet, go back to our master room...Why would I do that when we pay AN EXTRA FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THE SECOND BEDROOM A MONTH!!!???   This isn't the only thing. They have had construction, building, painting and really, any kind of thing that you could possibly think of causing noise (I'm not talking about everyday noises that you can just ignore), I'm talking about the loud, lasts several hours, inconveniencing your life in every possible way and preventing you from getting work done. I've been here since December 2015 and we haven't had one week of calmness.  Seriously, don't come here. We've lived in a few apartment complexes and this place is not worth a single penny. Walk away. Walk-the fuck-away. If you want to keep your job, keep up with school, not have your apartment fall apart every day, peace of mind - STAY AWAY FROM HERE.

The staff is unbelievably friendly and are always willing to make adjustments to appointments. The reason behind the four stars is simply the mannerism and professionalism of Dr. Ruggeri. He is most qualified, but the way of speaking to his patients makes me think of him as a person rather than a doctor. I continue to come simply because of the excellent Doctor Gary North. He is always willing to take time to ask questions and make me feel for assured of the course of treatment.  Overall I recommend this facility and two doctors and staff.
