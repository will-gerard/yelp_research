I went to this dental office yesterday on a Groupon that included exam x-rays cleaning and evaluation. When I got there they checked me and I filled out the necessary paperwork. When I went to the back with the X ray tech I was informed that I would NOT be getting a cleaning today and that she wishes they would explain the rules of the Groupon. I got x-rays and then the doctor evaluated my teeth and told me I needed  $1,600 worth of care. I asked can I just get the cleaning that goes with the Groupon and I was told NO that would not be the proper level of care. The office was nice the staff was nice. But the fact that they are very misleading with their Groupon turns me off from ever going back to that office again. All they had to do when I called and said I had a Groupon I'm a new customer they could have gave me a clearer  explanation. Nobody wants to be taken advantage of. But $1,600 worth of Care when all I need is a deeper cleaning... I call BS on that!

I was 1 of 3 hairstylist that worked the wedding on May 31, 2014. In my 20+ years experience I have never witnessed such a blatant disregard for a young couples special day. I cannot attest to things I did not witness, therefore I can, as a professional service person, tell what I witnessed first hand. Gregory was not only rude but defensive about his incompetent equipment. I specifically asked for additional party songs and his response was "the bride said no party music". That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. The Macarena or Chicken Dance is a NO GO, but regular party music of today was allowed. I told the bride what Gregory's response was and her mouth dropped. Unfortunately, I was not aware that by that time she was already upset because of the screw up with her father's dance and things started going downhill. In this day and time, what DJ doesn't have a proper computer system to play music or even a backup system? It's not rocket science! In response to the 80+ year old Aunt who passed out and needed emergency help, she DID NOT have to go to the hospital. She suffered heat exhaustion and was taken care of. How dare you, Gregory to insinuate that too much alcohol was involved. Shame on you. 2nd... how dare you to pass judgement on a family and their friends WHICH YOU DO NOT KNOW, and make assumptions that people are getting too drunk. I witnessed no one passing out drunk. The bride and groom thanked me and my team for our services and left the reception. The time was 10:30pm. How funny YOUR computer broke down at 10:30pm. My understanding was the reception was on till midnight. Just plain old terrible business practices, Gregory. When I get a PAID job, I do my job professionally and pass no judgments. With that said your company be it Arizona Nights or Phoenix City Djs will definitely be on my DO NOT REFER  list. My team has strong clientele base in the valley with over 20 years experience. Social media reaches a lot of places.

I'm only on the salsa and it's just as fabulous as always. I love the new location and the decor is beautiful. Open 5 days and the place is standing room only. To the previous negative commentor, they are way took busy to fill an order for beans. Go across the street....you'll be angry lol.
