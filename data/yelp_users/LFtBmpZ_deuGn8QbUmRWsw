Went in here late last night for an unknown rash I had developed the past week. Yesterday was the day the rash started growing more and it was not letting me sleep. So I decided to go get it checked last night at this hospital due to it being the closest one to my house. The nurse who took my vitals was so nice and made me feel so welcomed.  There was so no wait and so as soon as I arrived I was checked in, taken my vitals, and then quickly sent to the back to get checked.  I waited maybe 10 minutes until the doctor came in. The doctor (Dr. York) WAS SUCH AN ASSHOLE. He literally asked me why I was there at the emergency room for a rash? Like are you serious?! Isn't your job to cure people? Isn't that part of your job to evaluate anybody who walks into the door? He made me feel so irrelevant and no doctor anywhere has ever made me feel this way.

5 rolled tacos with guac and cheese and they tasted fresh?! Say what?!  The tacos were crunchy and the guac was pretty darn good! The red salsa surprisingly was really good and didn't have the watered down taste like other Mexican fast food places.  The drive thru was poppin since it was lunch time. The horchata was the best and again didn't taste watered down.  My mom had a carne asada torta and omg was the meat GOOD. It was so tasty and well seasoned!  So happy I tried this place out and stopped by because the food was worth it!

Decided to give this place a try for dinner last night since they were the only place that had sopes! Ordered to go, 5 rolled supreme tacos and two chicken sopes! My rolled tacos were one of the best ones I've ever had. They were hot, crunchy, and they were topped off with lettuce, guacamole, and cheese! It had the perfect flavor and they felt home cooked! My husband also enjoyed his sopes and said they tasted really good. I will definitely be back since they have such a huge menu of items to pick from!

Terminal 4 was a breeze to get through! I arrived three hours early (just because I'm so paranoid of missing my flight) but there was no need for that on that day!   From checking in, to TSA, no problems arose. The place was clean and there were many charging stations around the gate areas! The gate I was at only had like two restaurants to pick from, a pizza place and a cantina. Oh there was also a coffee shop!   Sky harbor has always done a great job of being clean! Definitely one of the cleanliest airports I have been through!

This is a cute little restaurant that I will always come back to! The service is always great and Sue the owner is wonderful!!!   The food is delicious and the portions are decent sized. You get a complimentary kettle of hot tea and chips when you get seated, and they are both so good!   The Phoenix dragon soup is AMAZINGGGG! (as I'm writing this I'm wishing I could have some)  There are many foods to choose from (chicken, duck, seafood, beef) and prices are reasonable! Definitely give this place a try if you are in the area and are wanting great food!

Very sad place to go to now and it's so overpriced. I'd rather make the drive and go to Harkins even though this location is literally 5 minutes from my house.   About six years ago this was the place to be on Friday nights! Now it's empty and they closed down the left wing of the movie theater probably due to service being so slow.

Yass went in to watch The Huntsman and it took me by surprise to see what they have done to this place!!! So glad to see that it's being renovated.  Seats recline all the way back and there super comfortable!  The concession stands seemed much more spacious and clean. Drinks are self serve so I believe refills might be free?  Cool to see that there is going to be a bar in the lobby part of the theater!  I will definitely be back!

Jessica our waitress was SOO NICE! She made our dining experience great! We waited about 20 minutes to be be seated for a party of two, but hey, it's Texas Roadhouse, I could've waited another 20 minutes!   The food was great as it always is! The steaks are flavorful, the sides are delicious, and the atmosphere is that of being in a country type of club. (It can be pretty loud in hurr) The music of course is country and they play all the new hits! Oh yes!   The rolls here are to die for! They are warm, toasty, and the cinnamon spread you get with them make it 263783x better! You get rolls as soon as your seated and of course don't be shy, you can ask for more if you'd like!   I love Texas Roadhouse!!  *During the week anytime before 6pm they have great offers and deals that go on!   *Sign up to their vip list to get a free appetizer!  *There are peanuts for DAYSSS here!

Such a great location! The employees are always friendly and helpful. I LOVE going to As You Wish! It's such a fun way to spend your afternoon by yourself or with friends!   Items are priced individually, and there is a set studio fee which is $8 per person. There are tons of colors and paints to pick from. They provide everything from stencils, to puffy paint, to even writing something out for you on your item in a pretty font. (For a fee) They offer tons of classes and they even have an app where you can find pretty good coupons!  After your done painting your piece, you leave it there (wah) and it usually takes about two days for it to be ready! For me it's the longest days ever! Make sure to ask for a punch card! It has pretty good perks on there! Anyways, if you love to be creative and have fun, definitely give As You Wish a try!

Had dinner here tonight! The service was great!!!! Our waiter was very friendly and very attentive! Best service I've ever gotten here from an employee. We ordered the loaded fries (so fricken good) a 24 pack of wings and we got a 6 pack of wings for free, since we had downloaded the Native App. The wings were hot and crispy and they tasted really good! Definitely had a good experience!

RJ was our server Saturday night and he did an amazing job! He was friendly, attentive, and would constantly check up on us! It was a pretty slow night and I believe at one point we were the only ones dining there. Better for us! The wings are what always bring me in!! The Asiago Parmesan ones are to die for!!!! We also had the sampler and it was pretty good! I always have a good experience at native!

Menudo was the bomb.com!!! Best menudo I've had from any Mexican restaurant! This was my first time here and it won't be my last! It was pretty busy when we arrived for lunch and it got even busier once we sat down. The tacos al pastor are great and so is the agua de pi√±a! Food and atmosphere was great!

Love how this mall hasn't gone downhill. The layout is literally one gigantic circle with never ending stores. Although a couple years ago, it was a little scary to go to do to due to all the wanna be gangsters and creeps that would prey on you as you walked by.  They've done a great job turning it around, remodeling it, and keeping it "in the moment." There is a lot of nice stores for example, Bebe, Charlotte Russe, Neiman Marcus, Starbucks, Oakley Vault, Victoria's Secret, and the Forever 21 is huge!! (Steve Madden coming soon!!) I can spend hours in there! The mall is always clean and people watching here is quite entertaining. There's also charging stations set out throughout the mall. The food court is spacious, and there's also an aquarium you can visit and soon to be some sort of legoland activity center! All in all you can spend a whole day at this mall!

Lunch here was really good!!!! Our waitress was really friendly and attentive!  Omg the bean dip that you get along with the salsa that comes with the chips is AMAZING!!!!! So tasty!!!!  I had a shredded beef chimichanga that was accompanied with rice and beans. (The rice was great) All in all definitely worth giving this place a try for some homestyle Mexican food!

I lived here a little over a year with my husband and never was there any issues or problems!   Management was ALWAYS helpful and friendly! The grounds are always kept clean, and maintenance always did an amazing job keeping this place nice! Work orders never took longer then a day and whatever issue you had would be quickly taken care of! It's a safe environment and you can def walk around the complex at any time (day/night) without being scared.   So sad that we had to move out of this complex because we really enjoyed living here!

SO FRICKEN GOOD!!! Just had brunch here and to my surprise the food was very tasty. This place was poppin since it is a Saturday, but we only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. Our waitress was very friendly and checked up on us a couple of times.  I had the sirloin tips with scrambled eggs, diced (yummy) potatoes, and biscuit and gravy. (These things are huge!) my husband had the chicken fried steak, hash browns, and the biscuit with gravy as well.  We spent about $30 including our two drinks. The portions are huge, the food was delicious, and the service was great. Definitely coming again!

This grilled chicken joint is by far one of the best ones I've ever been to! My mouth is watering just as I write this review...   The chicken is full of amazing flavor and it is accompanied with salsa, beans, choice of corn or flour tortillas, and pickled onions. There are also other different sides, (potato salad, macaroni, rice) and they have grilled jalape√±os! Yum!  The employees are always friendly and the chicken is always on point! This ole in the wall is restaurant is a definitely must!   Oh and it's CASH ONLY! The store next door does have an atm (small fee)

Food was great, and as always the portions are always big! This place is always "poppin" on Saturday nights. (The only nights I've ever gone) food is definitely good as far as how you prepare it. Easy concept, think of being in chipotle. It can get a little pricey but it's definitely worth giving a try maybe once.

This place is alright. Parking sucks. So much confusion in the parking lot it's ridiculous. Stop signs are hard to see and people don't follow directions.    On the weekends it's a hell hole.

Sad to see that a once thriving mall with happy families and fun stores to shop in is now long gone. This place is a ghost town that smells like dirty diapers.  The parking lot can be a bit scary and sketchy.  Stores that are still surprisingly here are bath and body works, Victoria's Secret, Cinnabon (yum) and Charlotte Russe. Everything else is equivalent to shops you would come across in a swap mart.  Skip this mall, you won't miss anything! (Except Cinnabon)

Great friendly service! Went in for a routine service check and they had me out within an hour and a half! As soon as I pulled up, there was somebody already there greeting me and tagging my car!   The facility is big and clean and there is plenty to see! They also have a barber shop, salon, kids play area, wifi lounge, and a massage place! This place is cool!

Ewww stay away from this location. The employees are snotty and have the "I'm too good" attitude. I've gone to other locations that have way BETTER brands and the clothes is cleaner and in way better condition. Most Brands I saw here were brands from like Walmart, forever 21, wet seal, and Charlotte Russe.  I found some shorts that I really liked and wanted to buy. (They were the mossimo brand by target and they were only $5) I go to inspect them for any holes, tears, etc. and to my disgusting surprise the shorts were CRUSTY IN THE CROTCH AREA!!!! Oh my goodness that was the nastiest thing ever! I literally almost threw up!  So stay away from this place! It's dirty, the store smells, and just not even worth it. Heck go to goodwill if you want a better experience!!

We sat down upstairs in one of the booths by the bar area. We literally waited 15 minutes before my husband decided to hunt down the bartender and let him now we were there. The bartender said he'd said someone right away so we waited..  10 minutes later and we're still waiting... My husband then went to hunt a waiter down and found out that they were just standing around talking. She then walks over and apologizes and takes our orders. We get food rather quickly and she barely comes around to ask if we're doing okay. Service was crappy and the only reason we stayed and spent our money there was because I work in the district and everything else was closed. I'm never coming to this location ever again. I rather drive to the Tempe Marketplace one anytime.

You can so spend your whole day here!! This place is huge and filled with tons of clothes!! A lot of brands, different colors, and plenty of fun styles. There are signs everywhere so it's easy to find the department your looking for.   Fitting rooms and customer service: HOTT MESS. It's the WORST. I literally waited 45 minutes to get into one of the juniors fitting room. (On a Monday)  The two rooms were taken by people who I heard were in there taking pictures and thinking the fitting room was a party room.. (No employee tending the fitting rooms) I was surprised to see that when they walked out, they had tried on about 40 items and not kept even one. So they hang there stuff on the unwanted rack and they leave.  So I get into my room (finally) and I hear the worker come over and complain to a customer about how the ladies had hung their stuff. She literally said (in Spanish) that she was not there so rehang things. So then the same worker says rudely out loud to me and the lady trying on next door "HANG YOUR STUFF THE RIGHT WAY"  No please, no thank you, and definitely not politely. At this point I'm done. I literally LOLed and walked out because I could not believe she said that..   All in all, beware that if you do decide to shop here, all items are final sale. So your stuck with having to try things on. You might get mauled and yelled at by the employees in the fitting room, be given death stares and be given a couple eye rollings when they see you coming...   Yeah I know it's a clearance center but that still means great customer service is appreciated. Without people spending here this place is nothing..   Last time here, byeee.

You can never go wrong with Morenos! Prices are reasonable and the portions are pretty big. Everything is so flavorful and made right when ordered. The salsa bar has everything you'll need! Avocado salsa, a red salsa, cucumbers, jalape√±os with carrots and limes!!   Do find yourself a table as soon as you walk in because this place tends to fill up rather quickly!!!!  Oh and you must try the carne asada caramelo!!! (Quesadilla with steak) Its AMAZING! (I get mine with no beans)

This place looks like it's closed from the outside. It's kinda sketchy looking. The service was okay. But why are the girls working there almost half naked?! It's kinda gross trying to eat sushi when the waitresses shorts look like UNDERWEAR. It's disgusting. Our food came out quick.  I had the chicken teriyaki and for it being $13 I expected it to be an amazing tasting plate. It lacked a lot of flavor and the serving was small. We also had the Vegas roll which was so good!  If I do come back it will definitely be only for the Vegas roll.  Oh and beware that if you do want extra sauce you will get charged 25 cents which is dumb for the little amount that you get.

BEWARE. Stay far away from this mall as you can. There is literally nothing here. Waste of time and space. Why is it still even open? I've seen homeless people hanging out in the parking lots asking for money, and you see the sketchiest things in every corner. Don't walk here anywhere alone...  I remember growing up this was the mall to be at! Blue neon lights adorned the overcrowded food court and people everywhere! It's so sad and terrible to see what's left of this mall. They need to just tear it down ASAP.. Oh and please hold on to your purse as hard as you can if you do tend to visit this place...

Very friendly employees! I took in about 50 items to sell including shoes, and they bought about 30! The process did take about 30 minutes due to the vast amount of people that kept coming in to sell. The store itself seemed to be a bit crowded and all the racks are fairly full with different brands and items.  This place is definitely way better with customer service then the Val vista one!!!!!

Love this place!!! The food is always hot, crispy, and very good! I always get the number two to share with the husband. (Includes two fish, 6 shrimps, fries, and a drink) for about $10 with tax!!!! I usually never eat seafood at fast food places because it's usually gross, but at Petes it's so good! Definitely recommend!  Oh and cash only!!!

Worst customer service ever. We walked in and weren't greeted, even though two employees saw us walk in and just continued talking. There conversation was much more important, so we were seated after they were finally done. Our waitress was quick to take our order and our food came out quite quickly..   We had 18 cold wings and a side of fried zucchini and French fries. The zucchini was good, but the fries tasted stale and were partially warm. The wings I'm guessing were just microwaved since that's what it looked like. Our waitress took three years ( about 10 minutes )  to bring us the check and almost quite as long to pick it up -_-  the restaurant wasn't even busy so I don't know what she was doing...

Always friendly and the food is always made to order! I LOVE the al pastor tacos, they are the best I've ever had!!!! The salsa and guacamole are the cherries on top! You cannot eat your tacos without those two!  Yes although this food truck is in a sketchy looking parking lot I have never felt uncomfortable. Definitely give this place a try if your wanting to eat some yummy street tacos. Oh and it's CASH ONLY. I also always bring my own drink instead of buying from here.

It's been about 30 minutes and I still haven't been helped....  I was told to sit and someone would be with me shortly. I see people walking in and out and get helped and I'm still here. Wah. Employees walk right past me without saying anything.  I wonder if I'm invisible....... Or maybe I'm being ignored because I'm not here to buy...

We arrived around 6:30 pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait. Okay so we decide to wait it out. About 20 minutes later we were seated and our waitress came over rather quickly to take our drinks. We ordered our meals.  Southwestern egg rolls: Amazing! Cesar salad: Just blah  Rib eye steak: Bland lacked flavor, not worth $24 GB mushroom beer chicken: Was really good!!! Chicken was juicy! Creme br√ªl√©e dessert: Gross pudding  Service: Our service was ok, the girl was attentive and friendly. We paid about $78 and plus a $20 tip.   Why the one star? I know my group (6 of us) stayed about 10 minutes past the dining room hours and we were almost close to being done. As I'm looking over to our server and some other girl (they are both vacuuming the booth next to mine) I hear the girl ask our server "Is that table yours?" In a very disgusting rude tone. Our server replies yes and rolls her eyes. The other girl then still has more jokes up her sleeves and says with an attitude, "Well im just trying to get out of here on time tonight." And being immature they whisper something to each other and laugh while looking at our table. REALLY?!?!?!?!? WTF!!!! Girl go get your self a day time job if working at night does not fit your schedule! If your gonna talk about your customers do it in the back!! Never coming back here.

Totally love this place! Yes you have to actually check the expiration dates cause some of the stuff is a month or too expired but other then that I love it! This location is definitely better then the last and it seems like there's better merchandise. You'll find name brand foods, home stuff and they also have a decent food court going on.  I like that they also have in new condition drugstore makeup at a very cheap price. It's definitely worth giving it a visit cause you will most def walk out with something!  Also if you spend more then $50 you get to spin the wheel for more discounts and prices!

BOGO BURGERS ON TUESDAYS SAY WHAT?!? These burgers are really juicy, tasty, and a good size so count me in! Our waitress was super nice and very attentive! We were seated promptly even though this place was full.  There are tv screens every where and people playing which looked like some sort of poker games in the center of the dining area! Very great atmosphere, and will definitely come back to this location since the Stapley one closed!

Dinner last night was very good! It was super cray because of it being cinco de mayo! We were seated rapidly and our server was very nice!  The chips are to die for because they make them there fresh. The guac is spicy, the red salsa tastes like canned salsa, and the pico de gallo can be spicy as well!  We waited about 15 minutes for our entrees to arrive which is not bad because they were super busy! Our food was really good, everything tasted great, and our server was on top of his game! Definitely will be back!

Rudest employees EVER!!! Walked in, was looked at, and the girl just turned around. Not even a smile. (Or at least a fake smile) I was looking to try out the Laura Mercier setting powder but there was no one to help me. The one girl that was walking around (looking clueless) had the crappiest expression on her face. (Like the I'm busy don't talk to me look) So I finally did approach some other girl and asking her to get the sample for me was like asking her to give me $100. She basically rolled her eyes and said let me see if we have that sample. Like please, these girls act like these samples are for them. Anyways, never going to this Sephora. They need to work on their customer service skills or not work in retail if they don't like their job.

Went in here last night for dinner. We should've known it was going to be bad as soon as we walked in. We were quickly told there was a 15 minute wait, why? Who knows because there was so many empty tables. Idk what was wrong with our waiter but he seemed a little lost. We told him what we wanted and when he brought out our food, it was incorrect. So he resolved that issue and put in our correct order. So we waited and waited. We almost never got refills. We had to ask another server for our refills because who knows where our waiter was at. Service really sucks at this location and I'm definitely not coming back.

Brace yourselves for screaming kids, kids running everywhere, clothes on the ground, and long checkout lines! This Ross is cray crayyyy! The weekends are a nightmare! Gosh how I would hate to have a closing shift here...   Visited this location last Saturday night and tonight, (Friday night) and there were piles and piles of clothes on the floor. The lingerie section had more items on the ground then it did hung.. The shoes?! Oh my gosh... The shoes.... I don't even wanna remember how messy the shoe section was.... Every aisle was worse and worse...  *On the weekends they close at 11:30! *Weekdays @ 10:30!

LOVE this place! Now that the weather is cooling down its the perfect place to take a stroll in the evening. It has everything you need in walking distance. Love how it lights up at night and how clean it always is! This place is a must visit.  Oh but do be careful when crossing the street, ppl in cars here don't believe in stopping for pedestrians. They believe they have the right of away..

This is my 6th year attending this festival, but this was my first year not going during the day. Today I spent my evening/night at this place. I paid $5 for parking and $10 for my entrance fee. Oh my gosh was this place PACKED. Your literally walking shoulder to shoulder with people and bumping into them! People here are rude. THEY WILL PUSH YOU OUT OF THE WAY. It was terribly crowded. BEWARE OF STROLLERS, THEY WILL RUN YOU OVER. There was trash everywhere and every single trash can was overflowing..  I definitely made the mistake of going late in the evening. There was high school age kids everywhere!!!! I literally did not see enough security/police walking around. I felt scared and or intimidated because there was a lot of teens that were trying to start fights..  I paid $28 for a wristband that entitled me to get on all the rides (man was the wristband a waste of money) I WAS ONLY ABLE TO GET ON THREE RIDES. The lines were ridiculously long, and it did not help that there is no control within the lines!!!!! People here CUT LIKE NO OTHER.. We had people in front of us about to start fighting because the TEENAGERS IN FRONT OF THEM LET 15 OF THERE HIGHSCHOOL FRIENDS ALL CUT!!!   There should be a curfew at this event and or implement better lines!!! It was so frustrating!!!  TIPS: DONT BRING LITTLE KIDS HERE AT NIGHT. There is half naked thots walking around, teenagers cussing out loud and misbehaving..  Attend this festival during the day Wear tennis shoes Don't eat here, too overpriced. Bring toilet paper (none of the stalls I went to had paper) If you hate people, don't attend this.

Very clean and friendly service! This place was super busy but so worth it! Both ladies who did my nails were nice and took their time on my manicure and pedicure!  Paid $39 for both, but they do charge a $1 fee for using your debit or credit card when paying! Will be back!

Always enjoy coming to this location! The employees are friendly and the place is always clean.  Went in last for dinner and to my surprise the place wasn't busy at all. (I've always gone on the weekends) our food came out orrery quick.   Spicy chicken noodle soup: BEST SOUP EVER!! (Chicken, mushrooms, noodles, cherry tomatoes) Egg rolls: were a bit on the greasy side, but they are huge Combo lo mein: was okay  Asian grilled salmon: full of flavor, super good! Shrimp with lobster sauce: fave plate on the menu! Banana spring rolls: (dessert) To die for!!!! The ice cream is creamy and delicious!

This place got a major face lift and it looks so much better! It was repainted and redecorated!   Went in on a Friday night around 7:30 and it wasn't at all busy. Our server was very friendly!!!! He took our orders right away and made sure to check up on us and that we had everything we needed!   Our food was made fresh and was good!!!! I always come here for the pupusas revueltas (pork with cheese) because they are AMAZING! I had the combo plate which includes two pupusas and comes with two sides. We also had a side of the plantains with black beans and sour cream. These were the sweetest plantains I've had!!! They were delish! Also make sure to try the tamarind drink, your taste buds will thank you!!  This will always be the place for my Salvadorian fix!

It was 10 pm and I decided to have some late night raising canes! (Any time I have a chance to eat some, I definitely will!)  Well I arrived at the drive thru line and there was about 4 cars in front of me. 10 minutes go by and I finally get to order. (the line is terribly moving REALLY SLOW.) Another ten minutes pass, and I finally get to the second window. The girl was friendly, took my card, swiped my car, and told me she would be right with me, and closed the window. It has now been about 25 fricken minutes and yet I still don't have my food. (WTF) As I look inside, I see high school age girls goofing and giggling around. Um hello you are at work! I didn't even get a "thank you for your patience" or even an explanation as to why I waited about 30 minutes for food.  So skip this drive thru if you don't have about 40 minutes to spend in the drive thru. I will just stick to the canes in Mesa!

Yummy hot dogs! Don't let the "shady looking" location steer you away from the yummy-ness of this food! I usually don't eat hot dogs, but these are the best I've had! Great that they are open late for a to go midnight snack!

Walked in on a Saturday night and was quickly told by which looked like a waiter that they were closed. It was only 10:15 so I'm not sure why the man said they were closed. Never going back, a place like that doesn't deserve my business.

Fast and friendly service!!!! It was pretty busy even though they were going to close soon. The tacos are AMAZING! We ordered several different meats, al pastor, carne asada, cabeza, tripa, and carnitas! They were all seasoned to perfection and I loved the fact that none of the meats had the fat that other places leave on there taco meats! The carne asada burrito was also great, and they can put beans in it if you'd like.   The salsa bar is huge and they also have huge grilled jalape√±os! YUMMM! I will definitely be back for some more delicious tacos! Can't wait to try out the rest of their menu!!  BRING A LOCATION TO MESA PLEASE!!!!

Walked in, glanced at the menu, decided on what I wanted, and yet still no one had came to the register to help me. TEN minutes later, the lady finally looked from around the corner and said "I will be right there." There were no cars in the drive thru or no one else inside so I have to no idea what she was doing. (It was like 2pm)  I ended up getting glazed munchkins, a chicken snack n go, two vanilla chai latt√©s, and hash browns. Thumbs up for the hash browns cause these are the best I've had from any location! The doughnuts were a little on the hard side but eh they were eatable... Oh my them tables! More then half of them had crumbs on them and they looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in ages...   Anyways, I dont mind waiting 10 minutes for someone to take my order, (no biggie) but hey at least acknowledge that I stood there waiting and maybe an apology would've been nice... And as I look at the other reviews, I'm not the only one that has had such bad customer service here..

Very friendly and great service! The place was clean and the girl talking our order was so nice!  The food was really good and it tasted freshly made! We had two chicken shwarmas, ($7.99 each) and they came with crispy fries! Definitely coming back!

I ordered for delivery and to my surprise the food arrived within 30 minutes of me ordering!  I ordered orange chicken, beef and broccoli, egg drop soup, and the pu pu platter. The pu pu platter consists of two ribs, two egg rolls, cheese puffs and dumplings! Yummy! The food tasted really good and was super hot. The egg drop soup is really good! Definitely ordering again sometime soon!

So this review is for a pick up order. I called in at 10 and was told it would take 15 minutes for my food to be ready.  I arrived at 10:30 and still waited 30 minutes for my food! It was so chaotic inside and ppl were getting mad for the long waits.  I hope my food tastes good.

Very quick and friendly service! Place was clean and organized! Paid $17 for a gel nail polish manicure! The wait wasn't too long and the nail technician was very nice.

Had a very late dinner here and was very excited to try this place out. The atmosphere is very laid back and the hostess nicely greeted us when she saw us walk in. We had the taco platter and ordered the beast burrito. The meat was deliciously flavored and I loved the fact the there tortillas are freshly made! There salsa is so good and spicy and we couldn't get enough. To finish off our meal we ordered churros which tasted freshly made! I can't wait to come back and have some more great tasting tacos!

Have been eating here for the past three days only because I'm working at San Tan temporarily.  I've eaten at different times ranging from 12pm to about 2pm. Every time I've been in the place is super busy. There are many tables to pick from but for the most part they are overflowing with trash. I'm not sure why ppl can't clean up after themselves Or maybe have the employees keep better watch. The food was okay, I've had better tasting food at other Paradise Bakery locations. For some reason my soups have been warm,  not hot.

I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately it's a no. The place itself inside is pretty nice, clean, and spacious. We ate outside where it was a little dirty.  I spent about $9 on a small cheeseburger meal that had consisted of an old piece of tomato and some lettuce. It also came with fries, one huge weird looking onion ring, and sippy cup size drink. (I had to get about 6282736383 refills)   The burger was just "eh" nothing stood out about it. In n out burgers are way better! The fries here though were the only things that I liked! They tasted fresh!! All in all, I'm gonna skip this place....

Visited the drive thru around 3:30 pm and we ordered one caniac combo to share! (Six pieces of chicken, fries, Texas toast, Cole slaw, two canes sauce, and a drink) We waited about 15 minutes to get our food. (There were two cars in front of me) The girl at the window was very nice and so we finally get our food and we happily drive away!  It came time for us to eat and to my disappointment our box consisted of, four pieces of chicken, two canes sauce, fries, and cold slaw. What the heck where's the toast?! Where are the other two pieces of chicken?! Such a pain that they would forget how to count and just miss the toast. We unfortunately did not drive back because we were already far. They didn't forget how to swipe my card though...   Anyways if you visit this drive thru please check your food before driving away!

Place was pretty nice and well kept. Very clean and friendly staff. We payed $29 for two and had unlimited access to pretty much everything. The food is overpriced and you don't get much for what you you pay for.  The bowling lanes are so much fun and will definitely come back just to bowl.

Employees walk right by you and give you the stank look. No greetings, no welcome in. The racks are so FULL you can't even browse through the merchandise. There is more clothes and accessories on the ground then there is hung.. The fitting rooms are always crowded and the people tending them are always in a bad mood.   Oh do be careful when walking! There are loose tiles everywhere, so shoes tend to get stuck in them every so often!    This store has potential but not with the people that work here. Maybe also with some new tiles?... And some smiles?... Customer service 101..

I had lunch here today and it was yummy! For $12.99 I had a 6oz steak, mashed potatoes, chili cheese fries and a potato soup (up charge for the soup)  The food was really good and the steak was cooked perfectly! Our waitress was really attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. This was my first visit here but definitely not my last.  Oh and if you sign up on their website you'll get a free appetizer coupon sent to your email right awayyyyy!

Never did I think I would love a seafood place so much! My mouth is watering as I'm writing this review. I want more lol. The seafood of your choice, comes at you piping hot in a plastic bag ready to be torn apart and eaten! I make sure to get the white steamed rice and the Cajun fries to go along with my half a pound of shrimp! Them Cajun fries though, there crunchy, spicy, and full of flavor! The corn is super sweet and the potatoes are flavored in the sauce of your choice! Prices are definitely reasonable for all the food that you get!  *Make sure you wear them gloves and bibs!!! Things can get a little cray cray!   Service is always great!

Ugh so yummy! I love this sandwich place! I'm always craving it! I had the turkey breast sandwich with mushrooms and everything on it. (Hot peppers on the side)    The sandwich was bomb.com! The shakes are also to die for! They are rich and creamy and flavorful!

Clean and well maintained store. I've been here several times and never have I been asked if I needed help or greeted. The employees just walk around acting like customers are invisible. Twice I've needed help but didn't either bother asking for help since up at the register I always see the employees chatting away.

Had a great lunch with my mom and my sister. Kevin was our server and he definitely provides great customer service! Glad he moved down to this location!  We ordered two phat azz sandwiches and a number three which includes three pieces of chicken and two waffles. Oh and had the yummy sweet tea and the tropical punch kool aid  (for some ppl both can be a little too sweet so I always ask for a glass of water to water it down a tad bit) I also got a side of the mac and cheese. (Extra charge) The food tasted great and the ambiance was welcoming. Def coming back!

Cute ice cream and shaved ice place! Right beside which was once the food court at San tan mall! The prices are reasonable and the variety and flavors for the shaved ice are endless!   Very friendly employee! The cups for the shaved ice though!!! I thought they were the cutest lol. First time I've ever seen those!

After having gone to another similar chicken place in Tempe, my expectations were high. This place was much closer to home so we decided to stop in.  There was no one dining when me and my friend showed up. The place was clean and the guy who took our order was friendly. We get our plates which consisted of chicken (not spicy at all) tortillas, and I forget what else. I think it was rice. Unfortunately, our chicken was SUPER DRY and BLAND. It literally had no flavor :( I really wanted to love this place but the chicken ruined it. It's a chicken place, shouldn't the chicken be tasting great? Maybe I will give it another try and hope that this time it's seasoned.

Cute little place. Always heard about the food truck but I never had the time to hunt them down. I decided to finally give it a try today since I was so close!  The place is cute, brightly painted, and feels very instagramish (hello new word) the menu is tiny and a little hard to read. Also the tables were dirty and we had to sit at the only semi clean one that was by the trash can.  There are many yummy toppings to pick from. I went with a grilled cheese and then a waffle with bananas, cream, and raspberries (YUMMY). We also had the red wonder waffle. You can either make your own or order the ones that are there already put together.  We waited about 15 minutes for the food to come out but that's OK, it was hot and freshly made! The grilled cheese was so good and cheesy and it came with a yummy tomato dip! I will definitely be back for more waffles soon!

Horrible experience!! Went in tonight for a to go order that consisted just of two bread bowl soups. We ordered a chicken and wild rice and a creamy tomato soup. The line was maybe 8 people deep and there was only one cashier. So we order our food and go and wait in the waiting area. The girl comes running to us and says sorry that they don't have any more bread bowls. Ok no problem. We get two bowls. Like a hot second later she comes back and says they don't have one of the soups we ordered. Um okay which soup? She says she doesn't know. She goes and asks and then comes back and says it's the chicken and wild rice one. Oh gosh and this point I just want to walk out. They don't have anything and its 6 pm. Shouldn't they have stuff for dinner?  Anyways, I'm not going back to this place. Everyone is lost and apparently there's no communication.

Yummy had the Jojos Mojo and it was so good! We always drive passed this place and never did I look over to see what had replaced the car wash. It's kind of abandoned looking so yes it is easy to miss. We also had a sugar cookie and it was so good! Most def give it a try. I will definitely be back to try out some more of their dranks!
