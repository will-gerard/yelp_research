I put in an order in early April, was told by Angela that I would have a proof the next day.  2 days later I called back looking for my proof, was told I'd get a call back the next day, still nothing.  1 week later I called yet again looking for the proof, Angela said I would get a call back that day, nothing.  Finally yesterday I received a proof for the wrong type of sign, I asked them to correct it, they then sent me the correct type of sign, but with the wrong name and wrong phone number.  They do get 2 stars instead of 1 because I've used them in the past and they do make a quality sign.  I don't mind waiting as long as I'm given an accurate estimate.  Also Josh really is a nice guy, he just needs some additional help.

This is an easy one, we go to one of the Four Peaks locations at least once per month and I've been happy every single time.  Always solid service, kid friendly (without turning into a kid-only restaurant), food is great, and of course the beer....  When I have a client moving into town I make sure to bring them here, it's the perfect local place to show off.

I've used Beast Printing many times, and they seriously print just about anything on anything, seriously.  They did my car decal, and not just the simple block letters, I showed them my website, and they matched the font/style and designed a decal that would go along with it to keep my brand consistent.  And when I needed a birthday present for a friend?  They made custom engraved shot glasses!  But beyond the printing, what you get with them is their professional experience.  I have vision for what I want a project to look like, and their end product always looks better than I could have imagined myself.  I strongly recommend Beast Printing for everything from the simple things like flyers, posters, pens, and shirts, to the out of the box things, like shot glasses, or anything else you could possibly think of printing.  Go ahead, try to find something they can't print!

Let's start at the top, the drinks are outstanding.  There's no other place to get a 24ish ounce jar of Old Fashioned that was perfect for two people, and not just the volume was impressive, the drink itself was top notch.  Followed by some cranberry drink with enough vodka to knock out a horse, but tasted like I was drinking straight juice, very well done.  For food we ordered three items off the menu, all were good, but the surprising star in the food category was the home made chips.  No doubt I will be back.

The best place to start with this review:  outstanding service.  I recently had Deborah from Espree out to a property my buyer clients were purchasing.  The home had recently had a leak in the garage, and also had a basement that raised mold concerns for the buyers.  There turned out to be no mold related to the basement or garage leak, but through a visual inspection Deborah found two other areas that concerned her, and after lab testing confirmed that both of the areas she found had mold.  In addition to her keen eye was her level of service, explaining the process and concerns with the clients.  I have been selling homes for 14 years and have worked with other mold inspection companies, but after working with Espree I will no longer consider any other!

IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN HERE SINCE THE NEW OWNER AND CHEF TOOK OVER, TRY IT AGAIN, IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLACE!!  We ate here once 4-5 months ago and were just so-so on it:  the food was good, but the service was painfully slow.  Then maybe 2 months ago we did a double-date with some friends who wanted to try it, and by strange luck we showed up on the day the new owner took over.  BOOM!  It was so much better!  We have now been back at least a half dozen times.  We've done dinners, breakfasts, or sometimes just a quick stop for a coffee and crepe or croissant.  Every time we walk away amazed!

This place was a great surprise.  I thought it would be intimidating based on their website, but I felt immediately at home, they were even welcoming to our sleeping baby.  The server was extremely friendly, and altered everything to be completely veg-friendly for us.  The food was great, and the desserts blew us away.  We were very, very happy with our visit.

I've both personally used Don at KMI Contracting and referred him to countless clients, for everything from major renovations to minor to-do lists.  And every referral I've sent his way has said he did a great job.  He's extremely up-front and honest about what the job will need, and I've never had a "surprise" come up.  Of course I assume once any contractor starts digging into a job there are bound to be unknown issues they find, but I've never had it with KMI, and I would think that's because his level of knowledge about his work is so high that he would be better suited to predict the potential hidden issues.  I never think twice about calling KMI when I have a need for a contractor or when a client asks for the name of a contractor I trust.

After my first meeting with Adam I knew that his info absolutely had to be saved in my phone.  Too many life insurance agents are more about pushing the sale than doing what's actual best for the customer, and Adam was definitely about doing what's best for me.  He reviewed my coverage at that time, went over my 'needs', and gave me what I could tell was very honest feedback.    I've since also met with him about long term care insurance and disability insurance, and his info on everything was 100% genuine and in my best interest, never once did I feel like I was being pushed into anything.    Great, smart guy, I can't say enough good stuff about him, without a doubt call him if you are looking for long-term/disability/life insurance, and I'm sure other similar things that I don't know about :)

First note that what I need in a restaurant is pretty specific.  Good food of course, but more important than that for me is the timing.  Every weekday I leave work, pick up the little one from daycare, call a restaurant for dinner pickup, and pull in the driveway as my wife is getting home so we can all have a nice family dinner.  I have probably 6-8 restaurants in the usual rotation, but am always looking to add more good ones.  I called Hopdoddy last night from the car for pickup, and was told by the manager who may have been named Brandon that they don't do call ahead orders, but he said if I came in and ordered it would be ready in 10 minutes.  My kid is 2, so waiting in a restaurant is near the top of my list of things I like to avoid, but at this point I was already in the car, so even if I stopped for a fast food it would take almost 10 minutes, so what's the harm in the extra couple minutes?  Fine, we'll give it a shot.  So to begin, 8 minutes alone in line.  I wasn't purposefully timing it, but thanks to a phone call ending as I got there compared to the time on my receipt, the timing was done for me.  I don't blame the restaurant for this part; they have two registers to order from, but one of them was taken up for most of that time by a couple in their 80's who must have decided this was the first time they were going to order food from anywhere, or they just liked to small-talk, I'm not sure, but they took forever.  The part that really got me was that we waited 20 minutes after ordering for our food to come out (thanks again to the time on the receipt for helping me track this one).  I don't like smoke being blown up my butt by anyone, but 20 minutes with a hungry toddler is much, much more than double the headache of 10 minutes with a hungry toddler, so don't tell me 10 minutes if it's going to be 20.  Then to top it off they bring the food on 'for here' plates, despite the two places they had indicated it was take out, combined with the fact that they seated us at their mini booths specifically for take out orders, so we then had to wait while they packaged it up.  Unfortunately this place has worked its way out of the rotation based solely on the fact that they don't take call ahead orders, hopefully that new burger place opening up by Pita Jungle does now that Indulge has sadly closed down.

Glen is a breath of fresh air in the world of insurance agents.  Not only does he know more about insurance than anybody ever should, but he is there when the need arises.  If you get in a car accident, or something in your attic starts pouring water through the ceiling, the last thing you want is to leave a voicemail for your insurance company. Glen is by far the most responsive agent I know.  I've referred multiple people to Glen, and only heard great things, call him!

I'm a Realtor and have worked with Paula for years to stage my sellers' homes.  Using the furniture they already have and rearranging their accessories/wall decorations she turns an average home into something that looks like a model home.  She has an eye for this, giving an end result that amazes me every time, and consistently gets my sellers' homes sold more quickly than the competition.  I would definitely recommend her for anyone planning on selling their home, OR have her out while you still live there and actually get to ENJOY the home, instead of just making it look beautiful right before you move out :)
