Disappointing. I've been coming to here for years now and the food never failed me.  I loved it there. However,  the most recent time I've came here the service I received was absolutely horrid! What's even worst is I was so happy to show my friends this place I loved to eat at. The waiter we had was a tall white male with a naploenian dynamite blonde hair. He was so rude, disrespectful, and obviously does not care for his job. I hope management corrects this immediately or I will find another place to eat. Overall, awesome food but shitty service.

It was my first time going to this place and I was pleasantly surprised!! From reading previous reviews I was a little nervous since I was planning to throw a surprise dinner party for my boyfriend. Right away, we were greeted and they lead us up stairs to a private room (the Pope room I believe). Since we had a large group we had two servers which was nice! The food was absolutely amazing! Large portions which was fun since we could share our dishes with each other.   Overall, Buca is a great place with delicious food! I would definitely go back again.!

Where to begin! First off the area in which the restaurant is located is not the most pleasant. But don't let that scare you away because the food is amazing! The inside is pretty small and not suitable for large groups. This place is also cash only. Every single time I go to Ritos I get a bean burrito enchilada style. And it is soooo good!!!!! It's pretty big and I only finish half of it. They also have some of the best tasting guacamole tacos, at times it has a kick to it which I absolutely love. Their quesadillas are huge too and packed with cheese. Finally, the tostadas and damn delicious! The only criticism I can give to Ritos in regards to their food is the salsa. I think they can up the ante with it. I would've given them 5 stars but their hours are always a hit or miss! I'd give them a call first to make sure they're open.

Best pho soup I ever had! It's a bit expensive but totally worth it! The crab rolls are so delicious as well! Seriously, don't hesitate coming here just do it! You'll absolutely love it! The staff is amazing as well!

Brought my boyfriend here as a birthday gift and I must say the staff here was absolutely charming!! So sweet, very attentive, and lovely. Even the phone call was a pleasant experience. As first timers, the young woman was more than happy to explain everything about their deals and the type of massage that would benefit my boyfriend. Overall, great place and I hope to buy a massage for myself soon :)

So my very first experience here was extremely pleasant.  They had amazing customer service and their food tasted great. However, my most recent experience was one out of the pits of hell. I actually work in the area and often went to this place for their chai tea drink being that it's my favorite and they have soy as an option. Now when I went this employee named Alan K must've had the case of the Monday's. Right off the bat he had a horrible attitude and was extremely rude! I asked for a chai latte and asked if they had soy. He told me "I hope so" with a rude tone. Well shit I hope you do too and hope you know what you have in stock being that you work there. Once he made it, it tasted nothing like a chai latte. It tasted like an iced coffee so I asked him if he could remake it. Through the whole time he was remaking my drink he kept bickering with me that it's going to taste the same because he's going to make it the same way. I told him that chai tea has more of a cinnamon taste and not a coffee taste and he continued to make these rude facial expressions trying to argue with me. Eventually he remade it and it tasted slightly better than the original drink. That experience alone was just a huge disappointment and frankly the customer service there from their employee Alan was the absolute worst! It's unfortunate since I really liked the place but after that experience I will not be returning.

I walked into this nail salon the other day and they assisted me right away. I don't recall the name of the man who did my nails but he was really friendly and helpful! I'm pretty indecisive so he patiently waited for me to pick a color. During the process of getting my nails done, he was very gentle and took his time.   I typically don't get acrylic nails because they would make my fingers hurt but this time around was different. They did not hurt or feel sore whatsoever! I would definitely recommend this place and I am definitely coming back!

I recently visited this restaurant with my family and right away the customer service was great. We were greeted at the door and were seated right away. Our waitress was very attentive and the vibes of the restaurant was very laid back and relaxing. One down side was when I received my pineapple juice and there was a small bug in it. However, our waitress was more than happy to bring out a fresh one bug free.  Now for the food. The food was amazing and I got the Crave Parfait.  I just wish that they could of given me more waffle pieces for my parfait but other than that it was very delicious.  I definitely would recommend checking this place out!

Mehh..this place could have more potential if the effort is put into it. It's not located in the best area and seems pretty dingie.   The customer service is awful. When I went in with my brother the other day, it just seemed like the workers are getting paid just to sit and hang out. We were not greeted and it took one of the employees literally 10 minutes to acknowledge my brother standing at the counter. It just gave off this shitty vibe like we weren't worth the assistance and that's definitely not a business I would invest in.   The quality over all needs improvement. The shoes they have aren't the best and typically just general releases. Nothing special really.  I think other consignment stores like P4P bring more to the table than this store does unfortunately.
