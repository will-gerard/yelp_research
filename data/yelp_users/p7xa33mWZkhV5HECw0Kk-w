Suzy hooked it up! It's unfortunate that I didn't find her sooner. I rolled the dice and got "almond shaped" nails after always traditionally sticking with "square tip." Asked her to not scare me off with it. I also got pink acrylic for the first time and told her to not scare me off with that as well. I've seem wayyyy too many pink nail beds and it's tacky!   All in all, good convo, she knows what she's doing and has owned salons in LA.   I got a scalloped French and she couldn't have a steadier hand. Average pricing. $40 for a full set, gel, French tip, and pink acrylic.

Lack of stars for saying they specialize in European cars when in fact they do  not. Moved to AZ and obviously had no idea where to go that could be trusted. They have awesome customer service but definitely seemed uptight after mentioning Yelp... Relllaaaxxx. My friend also brought in her Benz to get her AC looked at and after they charged her $200 to "probably fix it" she had to go to someone else to ACTUALLY fix it.   Not to mention they used the wrong oil for my VW. Went for a window repair and it sounded like sand was stuck and wouldn't roll all the way down.   Just be real about what you can handle.

These ladies are great! Always a welcoming environment and on my first class I was created with a hug.   The workout itself is intense. At first, I thought what could this actually do for me but after a week I could already see my glutes tighten!  It's a franchise which is odd to me just because the women here are so great.   They limit the amount of people in a class and weekends tend to be full! I did 6am and boy was that a wake up.   The instructors are all so pretty and fit AND nice, it's like geez talk about having it all.
