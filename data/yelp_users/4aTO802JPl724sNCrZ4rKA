You know when you drink all night and your (hopefully) sober driver reminds you that hangover-prevention starts with putting something in your stomach, but the only place open is the sketchy Jack-in-the-Box with no lights in the parking lot, but you're so drunk you don't care?  That pretty much sums up my attitude about this place when I'm in dire need of my daily caffeine dosage.  I've never had a good experience at any of these locations.  The good ole caffeine-driven coffee shop welcome has been replaced with a 30 second delay that allows the barista to finish their conversation before they drag their feet over to the counter to greet you with a "what can I get for you" in a not-so-well-hidden tone of inconvenience.  This definitely puts the mediocre coffee miles ahead of the staff.  And if you think "triceratips" is a clever play on words, think again, it's only because tips here are clearly prehistoric.   But hey, if you're into the raised-brow of judgment when you order a large, not realizing it doubles as a non-biodegradable tent for 5, you're really going to love this place.    The only good thing is that the setup isn't over-the-top and cheesy.  It's a pretty comfortable atmosphere to relax and read or visit with someone.  But be warned that if you sit at a table that hugs the bar, the bar patrons are going to read that 50 Shades of Gray over your shoulder, or watch "Chocolate Rain" on your phone with you.

When I was a kid, I absolutely hated pizza (and donuts, what).  However, somewhere within the last few years, that has completely changed and I will now crawl 3 blocks in the middle of summer, around Club Jersey Shore to get a slice of pizza here.   I've never been to New York but the level of friendless from the staff here is a good indication that this place is probably legit.    That being said, you can guess how great the pizza is if that doesn't deter me from shamelessly shoving two slices down my throat while still sweating from my walk to the restaurant.  Honestly, the pizza is amazing and it doesn't sit like a rock in your stomach after you inhale it (which you will, go for the pepperoni).  Plus, I'm serious about Club Jersey Shore, there were less neon shirts in the 90's than the club rats were wearing that gravitated towards this tribute to douchery.  Joe's New York Pizza: Dinner and a Show.

If you've ever experienced terrible service, you know the irritable feeling that builds and builds as you sit for 20 minutes and watch the tables around you being seated and waited on until you're finally "greeted" by a surly waitress rushing you to order after she finally decides to waddle her way to your table.    I had some high expectations for the place because I'd heard everyone rave on about it, so I was patient and enjoyed the cheese crisp appetizer that came 15 minutes after ordering it while the table of three directly across from my duet table enjoyed the meal they ordered after they sat down 15 minutes behind us.   As the clock made it's way to the 45 minute mark, and all the ice in the water pitcher they gave us had long-since melted, my friend laid out her ultimatum, "if she doesn't come out with the food the next time she comes out of that kitchen, we're leaving".  Even though I was dying to try the fajitas, I was all on board since the cheese crisp had already settled in my stomach.   Apparently I was meant to have fajitas that day because I heard that distant sizzling that whispers "yourrrr fajittasssss arrrrre coooommiiiinnnnggg" get louder and louder until a stranger popped in front of us like a ray of sunshine over our gloom.  Quite the contrast from our waitress, that was clearly deciding to indulge in her mid-life crisis during the Father's Day rush, he was exceptional.  I suppose she had already kissed her tip goodbye when she came to see if we needed anything a couple of minutes after we finally got our food (from someone else) and we asked for the check (since we didn't want to wait until closing to get it), because she was sure to impart upon us a sassy, "I will if you'll give me a minute".    NEVER in my life have I complained at a restaurant and I would have taken it all with a grain of salt if she hadn't used the tone she used when we asked for the check, but that was too much.  On top of that, she began rushing us out of the booth once she placed the bills in front of us.  "Would like some to-go cups?"  I know the server-vernacular you fossil fuel.   We flagged down a bus boy to send a manger our way and he was polite enough to give us a discount (of course it was the principle of the whole situation at that point).  She avoided us like the plague before, but when she saw that manager hovering over us, she was suddenly Gladys Kravitz.   After paying our discounted bill, we found the bus boy who had basically done our waitress' job and gave him a very generous tip, leaving her nothing.  Another first in my life, but well-deserved, and I flew out of there in hopes to avoid the already awkward situation of the restaurant-complaint.  Had the food not been delicious, I would've given this place 1 star and had the service not been atrocious, I would have given it 4 stars.   I'd recommend the restaurant, but not this particular location, especially if there is any sort of holiday, or the scent of any sales going on in the area.

My Mexican food standards are pretty high and everyone SWORE by this place so I finally tried it a few months ago.  If I'm going to suffer the plight of diarrhea, I'd at least like some flavor to make it worth it.  I would truly prefer eating frozen burritos over this place.    I'd also like to know who provided this restaurant with a single dollar sign.  I paid $12 for a soft tortilla on the bottom of my taco salad, bland meat and sparse, tasteless cheese sprinkled on top with a side of the nastiest salad dressing I've ever had.  Oh, and a small drink cup.   I had to shout my order across the noise to the person making my order and could barely hear the questions being asked.  I might have verbally agreed to the assassination of someone being held hostage in the kitchen, I'll never know.   Normally, that sort of thing doesn't bother me with this style of  restaurant (the shouting, not assassination), but this was worse than a bar on a Saturday night hosting 5 21st birthday parties.  And the atmosphere?  Kids everywhere, kids screaming and kids dropping their food and crying. I'm not a kid person, but the parent to child ration was 1:3 and that could shake anyone trying to eat lunch.  The tables were so close together you had to ask the guests behind you to scoot forward so you could get out and the tables were built around the waiting line so the people in line had the pleasure of watching you eat and you had the pleasure of being uncomfortable. I could go on and on, but you get the gist of it.    Every offer for free lunch to this place has been declined every since that first visit, I will never eat there again.

When you walk in, be prepared to wade through a sea of Macbooks to the "MacRegister".   Pretty sure the term "hipster" originated as a password for PC users to get through the door here.   Atmosphere is half of the experience for the coffee shop lounger and though this place has zero personality, it's definitely neck-deep in "trying too hard".     As far as the coffee goes, it was nothing exceptional.  However, I will give them credit for not burning the hell out of the espresso, which seems to be a popular trend these days.  The staff was also friendly which brings a 1 star rating up to a 2 because friendliness is just as important as quality when I'm giving my money to an establishment.  Peeking through the reviews, I saw, "free range, organic only, vodka marinated, all natural (american spirits only, thank you) smoked people to eat" so if someone could cue me in on that, I might reconsider this place (yeah cannibalism) since there was nothing else spectacular enough to make me willing open that door again.

This place is cheap, and I'm talking Fred Mertz cheap.  In fact, while I'm in the ballpark of I Love Lucy, let's recall the chocolate factory episode where Ethel and Lucy are shoveling chocolates into their mouths.  That's basically what goes down when I walk through the door in this place.  "Pick that plate up, I wanna try that!"  Even if I don't like it, I'm out what, $1.50?  I've lost more trying to get the mini Rubik's Cube key chain out of the 50 cent machine at the grocery store, and I've yet to leave the grocery store with the victory key chain.  Teharu is a bit uncomfortable at first, especially when you see that the conveyor goes behind a wall where who-knows-what happens, but can you really justify that discomfort whilst stuffing your face with raw fish?  Sushi lovers have all had bad sushi and it's really never as bad as you imagined it, so what's a sneeze or two on a roll (if that's the case)?  Honestly, you can't beat the prices for the quality of the food here.  No, we're not talking 5 star sushi, but definitely a good place to satisfy a sushi craving when your pockets are light.    It's also a decent place for a first date since the atmosphere refuses any awkward silences.  You're guaranteed to either be seated next  to the chick posting and filtering every roll on Instagram (that's me), or the old man asking his grandchildren what the hell the orange stuff is on top of the food and how can they eat that Asian hot sauce.   Just don't evoke your inner rudeness and reach across your neighbors... it's happened.  I've never had a bad experience here or spent more than $20 eating more sushi here than any human should be allowed to consume at any given time.  Sure, sometimes you get a roll with a texture that is the equivalent of blow-out-tire-debris on the highway, but again, we're talking color-coded plates to mark prices that don't exceed $5... for sushi.  And sometimes for canned fruit cocktail, which most likely the old man will be eating after he realizes what the orange stuff is.  A coffin is the only thing that could prevent my patronage here, especially after my bills and rent are paid but my stomach says "gimme something fancier than Kraft".  Decent sushi for a decent price.

I'm truly astonished at the amount of negative reviews for Buca!  I've had nothing but excellent service and great food at this place.  This place, hands down, has the best caesar salad I've ever had in my life (100% serious).    Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of taking a chunk out of my life savings to pay for a dinner bill for 3 people, but I've always left painfully full with a large bag of leftovers.  It doesn't have the warm, hole-in-the-wall Italian ristorante thing going on, but the atmosphere is still very welcoming and I love that for large parties, you have your own private section.   Each room has it's own theme and you can stare at the walls all night and still find something you missed before.  Anyone who is unhappy with the wall decor was evidently not seated in the room with the pope head because if that's not class to you, I don't want to know you.   Perhaps those decorating needs would be better met at a faux-posh restaurant with paintings and wall decor that looks strikingly similar to the Big Lots Home Accents section like they have at The Olive Garden (which is still super delicious by the way).   Seriously with the food though, definitely on my top 10 list of death row meals.  I could totally go down with their Veal Parmesan making itself a coffin out of my stomach.

Alright, as a level 10 caffeine addict, I have tried coffee shops all across town and of them all, Dutch Brothers easily has the best espresso.  It's never burnt (ahem, Starbucks I'm looking at you) and it comes with a brilliant rush that I float on for quite a while.  It's absolutely refreshing during the summer too. Of the few Dutch Brothers I've been to, this is the only one that always seem to get my drink right, no matter how it's worded (don't worry, that other location will get a review too).    However, I'd like to mention that as a socially-awkward person, I avoid Dutch Brothers on many occasions because of the over-friendly staff.  I know it's part of their job and I've been informed that they are sent home if they aren't friendly enough, but not everyone is into talking about what they're doing during the upcoming weekend on a Monday morning.  I see a lot of people enjoy this and I'm glad their friendliness is effective, but I'm not a fan.  If you've ever been forced to revive the dead carcass of a conversation, you know the stench and decide it's better just to plug your nose and keep going.  However, this location generally seems to pick up that I'm awkward and leave me be, and because of that I prefer buying my delicious beverage here when I decide I can handle the onslaught of ten people synched together through a caffeine rush.

All I have to say is $1 bin.  So far, Otis Redding, Ray Charles and Solomon Burke duo album, Roberta Flack, Slim Whitman (just kidding, I didn't buy that but it's probably still there if you're interested), Buddy Holly, Simon and Garfunkel and Nina Simone - all $1.  Okay, a few were scratched but I'm not a collector nor am I going to cry over a $1 when my favorite track sounds like a bad loop.  However, if you're into impressing your friends with scratched records, you're in luck because they have tons.   The selection is a bit scant if you're looking outside of the dollar bins, but the quality is there to make up for it and the prices aren't ridiculous. The Tempe location doesn't compare to the Phoenix location either, but the only real local competition is Zia and when I add up the total hours of work I had to do to buy an album there, I always end up giving em' the ole "it's not you, it's me".  Plus, their grab bags might as well be called "estate sale reject surprise bags" because I got one for Christmas and the South Pacific soundtrack and holiday compilations don't qualify as exciting grabs.  The store is small but even in elbow-to-elbow traffic, I don't feel flustered.  They also adjust the music volume according to current customer volume which is a big plus since I'm not a fan of having people shout my total to me in a store with only 3 people inside. Overall, I love this store, I really do.  I've never regretted a purchase and I've never left empty handed.  If you don't like it, give it a week and check the stock again, there is always something.  Seriously though, dollar bin, worth the knee-cramp every time.
