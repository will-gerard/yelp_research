Very nice and organized. This is an airport that I can say that has a "personality", you know you are in the Midwest... the seated restaurants and the fast food are really local and good.  Even the souvenir stores are well stocked, not only keychains and postcards.  Free Wi-Fi is definitely a plus. If I need to have a stop b4 my destination... this would be my choice other than Charlotte.

I used to come very often to this Pei Wei because we don't have any where I live.  Today I had a connection to Newark (6/10/16  @ 9:55 pm) so I wanted a fast plate to take to the plane. I ordered the spicy chicken. I've received my plate pretty fast as on the other times but... surprise, my first piece of chicken was not fully cooked and bloody so I went back to the counter and asked for another plate. Instead of an apologize or a complimentary something... I could see and heard the "chef" saying: "it's only one piece". I was furious about it... even if is "one piece", you are giving your customer raw meat!!. I didn't say anything and just wait for my new plate (of course,  checking that my food was not being contaminated with other things after my complain). I wanted to ask for the manager and tell him how unrespectful was the comment from his employee but I was getting late to my flight. So I really hope the establishment reads Yelp to improve their customer service.  I really enjoy Pei Wei... but I hope they train their people. I can understand that everybody makes mistakes but that was not the way to address my observation about a wrong cooked plate. Even when I got my new plate, I did not get a sorry from anybody.

Very nice modern coffee kiosk with friendly people serving you.  The coffee really amazed me, I went with low expectations just to get a cup of Java but I was wrong. I've got an Americano and the taste was balanced and with good flavour.  It can sound not relevant at all but the design of the cup made with corrugated material feels very comfortable and you don't need to use any slid to don't burn your fingers.
