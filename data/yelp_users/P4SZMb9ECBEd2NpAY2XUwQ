DO NOT EAT Sushi HERE!!! It's only 1 step above gas station sushi. We tried it for the 1st time. All of our sushi was cold, service was poor, selection was limited & the rolls only had names but no descriptions of what was in each roll. If you want great sushi-go-round, I suggest you go to Seksun sushi. It's only 10 minutes away & everything is great there.

I LOVE pho & wanted to get a quick pho near the Mekong grocery store so we came in. I'm only one year new to Phoenix & have been trying as many pho places as possible. The service was quick but the servers we short & rude. I ordered the pho with everything. This place may be called unphogettable but my pho was very phogettable. It was under average & the prices are the most expensive that I've seen in Phoenix. I will not be coming here for pho again.

This was my first time here. I loved the ambience. It felt modern & classy. I came with my family. Their menu has many choices. We shared the Otaku platter for an appetizer. Everything we ordered tasted wonderful! I had the Galbi- Korean ribs. The only complaint I have is that you get only two pieces of ribs for $14. I feel that it's too pricey for the size. Our server was very accommodating & the manger came to check on our table to make sure everything was ok. All in all our we had an awesome 1st time experience! I definitely recommend it to everyone!!

For someone who thinks buffets are only ok, this buffet blew me away!! If you're in Vegas & want to choose a buffet, I suggest this one! There is a great supply of variety. I actually ran out of stomach room & didn't get to try everything I wanted to try.The food didn't taste bland, dry or overcooked like at most buffets. Everything was hot, fresh & tasted like what it was supposed to taste like. All in all, I give this buffet two thumbs up!!!

I love my donuts & have tried most of the donut locations in the East valley. This is the Best donuts in all of the east valley!!! Hands down this place beats all of the other Asian donut places in town. The owners are local & very friendly. They are always friendly & the prices are reasonable. If you're near the area & love/want donuts, come here!!! You will not be disappointed.

This place is a wonderful find! They have a pancake flight! How amazing is that?! I love pancakes & that's the best thing you could give a pancake lover. I tried the strawberry-rubarb, pineapple upside down & banana Nutella. They were all delicious! My husband had the chocolate peanut butter pancake & his was just as good. Everything tasted wonderful! It's a must try for breakfast!
