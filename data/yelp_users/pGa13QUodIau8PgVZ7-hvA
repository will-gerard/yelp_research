Chicago Joes was delicious. The atmosphere is cozy. The service was great. We called ahead for reservations. I recommend it!

I have stayed at the Nugget several times. This time I had a problem with the parking. I tried to valet my car and was told it was full. I went to self parking and was told it was also full. I asked where I should park and they told me " you will have to find somewhere else".  If I am a guest at a hotel.... They should have a parking spot for my car.

Cute little place. I was hesitant because I didn't want to wait hours to be seated. We got right in. Pizza was good. Not the best but good :)

This is my go to place when getting together with my girlfriends. The food is amazing and the wine is great! $5 wine before 5:00...

Everything about this place was great. We went here for my birthday. Our server Matt was awesome.  We wanted to try so many things... We went with the chips and strings, bacon, baked potato, salad, Mac and cheese, and a steak... All great!

We shared the Mac and cheese burger. It was the weekly special. Delicious! We also had the fries and a salted caramel shake... Yummy:) Zinburger has the best burgers. We will go back again and again.

We stopped by Pomo's this afternoon. The pizza was delicious. We sat at the bar next to where they make the pizza. The guys were friendly and wanted to make sure we were satisfied with our food. All fresh. Service was fantastic. We will return!

The food here was yummy. We sat in the bar area. The service was great. I think sitting outside when it's not summer would be cool.

I tried this place late at night. I was disappointed in the pizza. It was sitting for a long time.

I was so disappointed in this place. We had the sliders for a late night snack. They were not tasty. The onion rings were better than the fries.

I final made it to this place. I had the Italian sandwich, double dipped. Yummy!  It was busy, but the service was fast. You just walk up and order.
