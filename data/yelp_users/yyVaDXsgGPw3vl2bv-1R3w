Love Oregano's. Been going to Oregano's for good 10 years. Started off in Tempe, while I was going to ASU. Wonderful food no matter what you get. I've tried pasta, pizza, salad, just sooo good. Not to mention Pizza-Cookie(forgot the spelling of real name) is to die for. I don't care what BJ's says ( they claim that their's is original and better) I think Oregano's Pizza-Cookie is the Best!  My one and only request I ask everytime I go there is to open a store in west side. I love the place, just too far... but I always try to find a reason to drive there.

Love Marc's right side. Doesn't matter which night of the week, I can always find somebody I know. Trish, bartender, is so sexy I want to take her home but she won't let me. Scooby Steve, another bartender, sing so well he might as well be a country singer himself. Most of the people is nice. Not a huge fan of left side (hip hiop side) too dark for me.   If you want to go to Marc's and enjoy, try to go with somebody who's been there before, or be ready to make new friends. Never pick a fight with regulars, or you'll have the whole bar against you.  "I love this bar~" comes to my mind... Who's song was it?

If your steamer is turned off because it's 1 hour from closing time, please inform us and we won't order. Don't nuke the crab legs. Leg meat was a string. I can't even find words to describe the misery of these crab legs. I sent it back and 10 minutes later, I got the same legs. Well, I'm sure it is not the same legs, but it was dried out as same way. 10 days old crab legs. Nothing else to say.

After reading some of the previous reviews, I didn't think I need to write anymore, but why not...  The $10 off $20 ticket coupon lured me in. I talked my husband into going there even though the last experience wasn't the best one. So, that said, it was not that good this time either.  First of all, they got rid of personal portion. So we had to choose something we both would eat. Now, my husband and I have very different taste buds. That's why we go to a restaurant!! So I don't have to make 2 different meals for the evening. Also it seems like they have raised the price when they made fancy-new-menu which had more ad by us-air or something that had nothing to do with their food... like Cheese cake factory's menu... (is that just to cover up the fact that they have no variety to choose from...?)  We finally decided and ordered garlic bread and seafood pasta. $9 for garlic bread and $20 for a bowl of pasta... Hmmm why do I get the feeling I'm getting ripped off?  So anyways... food was descent, but I don't like to be forced to get meal for 3 when I just want something for me

Oh my god. This is THE BEST pho I've ever gotten in my life. Been here few times already, (don't know why I haven't yelped yet, probably because I was too busy stuffing my face every time) and food is consistently excellent.   Food had so far; #1 (pho with everything), bun bo hue (spicy beef broth with noodles), egg roll, spring roll, crepes. Let me just tell you. They were all good.   If you are up for a challenge, get #1 super duper.   Now if you would excuse me, I'm going to stuff my face.  Try this place and see it for yourself.

My friend took me to Great Wall last night. I read few reviews on Yelp when I got there. Krestin B's review worried me a bit, but oh well, I was already there.   Big place. We sat in the corner away from big party. (Asians could get loud sometimes when they are in group...) I noticed the fish tank in the back. Didn't go back there to take a close look, but they seemed to be all swimming ;p  My friend ordered BBQ Pork right away. Crispy and yummy. Little bit on the salty side. First lady that came to our table for drink did not speak any English. I wish I had paid more attention in Chinese class... Anyways, we ordered Sizzling mixed seafood, spicy eggplant, and hot and sour soup.    Right after we ordered, I saw a man grabbing fish from a tank. mmmm, live fish... Can't get any fresher than that. Soup came out first, of course. Very good. Just the right amount of spicy and lots of chunks (veggies) in it. Even though I wanted to eat the whole bowl, I only had 1 cup, so I can eat the rest to come. Here comes Eggplant. To be honest, I didn't know he had ordered it til it came out. Love the sauce. Eggplant was crisp on the outside, yet nice and mushy on the inside. Brown sauce was very tasty. When I had few bites of eggplant, Sizzling seafood plate came out. It was sizzling ;p Seafood with white sauce. Again, sauce was excellent. Squid was little over cooked. Very tough and chewy. Broccoli and snow peas weren't over-cooked so it was crunchy. I liked the sauce so much I took leftover sauce home with rice...   After we were done stuffing ourselves, check and fortune cookie came out. My friend asked for a orange instead. I was told by my friend that if you're not an asian, you don't get oranges. They said it was too sour for American taste buds. We got them anyway ;p  I can see why Krestin B said it was blend. It was flavored towards Asian taste. The real Asian food is not supposed to be very seasoned. You go to Panda express and they salt the crap out of your food, that's called Americanized. Asian foods are very mild in flavor. I hate to serve something and they drench in soy sauce.   Anyways, don't forget to ask for oranges if they don't give it to you.

Leaving hungry.   Waited 45 min and barely saw any cart come around. We used to love coming here, but last few times it seems to have gone down hill. Less selection, most food are cold by the time it gets to the table. Today was worst. Very rude attendant and no food available makes very unhappy customer.

Ok, I will give them overall 4 star.   I've been here more than I can count. Some bad, some good experience.  Bad experiences were due to not-so-tasty dishes. I had a fish egg soup one time and they were so freezer burnt, I couldn't finish them. I haven't been back for few months.   The recent visits were today and last week for lunch. The crowd was decent. 5 or 6 tables. I ordered beef soup($7.99), my husband had spicy chicken($6.99). He liked his chicken. I was bit surprised since he doesn't really like korean food. My soup was good. We also got 6 side dishes. kimchee, cucumber kimchee, fish cake, radish, potato, and spinach. They were all good.  The service could get little bad since they don't seem to have enough server every time I go there. My tip for you, Don't wait for them to ask how you are doing. Ask them what you need when they pass by you. I know that's rude, but sometimes that's only way to get help.

The last time we went there was on Mother's day 2011. We had a surprise visit from a bug (Caterpillar looking thing) in our spicy octopus with noodle dish. Where the heck did it come from?! It was still crawling!!! I called the server over to show it to her and all the staff in the restaurant decided that instead of apologizing, they told us that we brought it in from outside. WTF. No way. They still charged us for the food. At least they didn't charge extra for the bug.

This place was awesome when they first opened. Not so much anymore. It seems like the food grade goes down everytime I go there.   Last time I went was in September 2009. side of rice I got was spoiled. Like rice smelled like fermented bean. Most of the side dishes tasted on the berge of spoiling too.   I loved it because it was closer to where I live, but now I have to drive further away to get good korean food. it's shame. They stopped delivery service too...

Went there to meet someone after I've already ate at Olive garden on Sunday (read previous review). It was 7 pm and this place was EMPTY! I was bit surprised. We walked in towards bar area. there were only 2 other people there. We weren't hungry, but I can always eat (as I'm munching on kimchee right now), especially seafood. so I glazed thru their menu. I noticed 'micro brew' in beer section. Since I love beer, I asked if they brew their own (hence, micro-brew...) She pointed out bluemoon, sam adams, and something else... Ummmm, I have never seen any restaurant categorize them as "Micro-Brew" oh well, I got bluemoon. $4.25 for a pint.   My friends had ahi-tuna salad. I glazed thru the menu some more for food, but nothing really sounded good...  It was a very short trip to the place. Had a beer, and left. by the time we left (8pm) they've already shut down the dinning area.   I guess we won't be coming back here anytime soon.

Do not rent car dolly or anything that attach to your car.   My husband had to move his project car from garage to storage. He rented full size trailer. Some really young looking kid came out and hooked up the trailer to our truck. We went back to the house, got the car on the trailer and way to the storage... on West bound Grand Ave, the trailer locked up, tossed us all over the road, finally came off of hitch and rolled to other side of East bound lane (in front of Food City).   Scared the crap out of me. Luckly, car was fine and nobody got hurt. We had to get trailer towed to storage because it was still locked and our car was on the trailer. Somebody from Uhaul came and got the trailer the next day. When I got my bank statement, they charged us a lot more than what we originally signed for. They ended up charging us for 3 days and kept deposit too. After arguing with them numerous time, they refunded all but 1 day of charge. I think they shouldn't charge us at all since we couldn't use the trailer and we had to pay for towing too.  They were rude...

Went around 3pm with a friend. Sat at a sushi bar. There were 2 other people sitting couple seats down. Where are sushi chefs? Maybe they went to have lunch...   We ordered hot tea to start. Where is the happy hour menu? Do you have to ask for it to get it? Anyway, we just had regular menu.  We ordered Tuna, Halibut, Salmon, Octopus sushi, Albacore sashimi, and Dragon Roll ($14.00) Shrimp tempura appetizer.  Few minutes later, sushi chef (Paul) came out. It was weird he didn't say anything. No greeting, no how are you doing, no "irasshai" (typical greeting in Japanese). He sliced albacore sashimi and served it to us. It had garlic ponzu sauce on it. It was tasty, but the garlic was over powering the actual fish flavor. Shrimp tempura came next. It was heavy and soggy. Tempura is supposed to be fluffy and crispy. Tuna sushi was next. I had one piece and gave my friend the rest (5 pieces). Fish itself tasted fine, but the way chef sliced it made it fishy. He sliced it along the grain, not against it. Same with Halibut. It was so thick I had to chew it for long time. Halibut is supposed to be very thin and melt in your mouth. It's also supposed to be served with citrus ponzu, but didn't. So I asked for it. They gave me garlic ponzu, the same sauce they had on albacore. Not the same. True ponzu sauce does not contain garlic. Dragon roll was last. I was wondering what made this roll $14.00. There were so much eel on it, I had to separate eel from actual roll and eat it separately.  Another sushi place that think bigger is better. No knowledge of art of sushi.   The whole time we were there, sushi chef said 1 word. "How is everything?" after we ate everything. Sushi chefs kept disappearing after he made our order. I sat at sushi bar to interact. But they kept going to waitress station and talking to themselves. Loud enough for me to know they all spoke Korean to each other. The 2 ladies sitting next to us didn't help the matter either as they were laughing so hard it sounded almost screaming. We were still hungry, but we did not feel welcome there, so we just left.   I tried it because they had such great reviews. My experience was not as good as other reviewers here.

I go to Lee Lee's every week. I've taken food to go twice from this place. Today, I decided to eat in for business meeting.   Lunch special was $7~10. It took few minutes for them to take our drink order even though there weren't that many people.   My partner ordered pork cutlet, I ordered seafood and chicken in white creamy sauce and singapore noodle. The waiter was very pushy and rushed us to order. He took my menu before I finished ordering. (after I ordered seafood, he took menu before I ordered noodle...)   I wish lunch special came with soup or something, but it didn't come with anything else but white rice and cup of entree. Portion wasn't that big either. I was bit disappointed with the sauce. It tasted like alfredo sauce. Not what I wanted in a chinese restaurant. Maybe it's just me. If someone who's reading this review like creamy white sauce, the sauce itself wasn't bad. It just isn't my favorite. I guess I didn't read the "creamy" part of description. I wanted white garlic sauce, which is more clear sauce with chunks of garlic in it.   Singapore noodle was good. Veggies were crispy, not too overcooked. (I hate mushy bean sprouts) Good amount of curry seasoning.   After reading some of the reviews here, I'll try BBQ pork next time.   One more thing before I wrap this up. They auto-grat 15% in our tab. Party of 2. That gives them 2 star, not 4. It goes back to tip talk few weeks back. I, as a customer should decide how much, not a server. I peeked the table next to us as I was walking out, their tab also had tip included, party of 3.   Food was decent. Auto-grat for party of 2 turned me off. I'll go back to takeout option.

I completely forgot about my experience 2 years ago and went back to eat  again... This time, they didn't list the auto-grat in bill. Instead, they just added to the credit card bill after wards!! My bill was $26.04, I put $28.00 in total, my statement says $30.04. They didn't like what I wrote for tip, so they gave themselves a little more. I left little for a reason. They didn't do anything to serve us! All they did was took the order, brought the food (not even at the same time. 3 meals came in 3 different times.) And the bill. No refill, no checking on how we're doing, or how the food tasted, or need anything else!  Keep your receipt and check your account to make sure they don't add more amount than you wrote in. I'm not concerned about $2 they added more, it's the principle of the fact that they did it. Very bad way to do business. A scam.

Wednesday, 50 cent wing night. Walked in about 9:45, so host. So we cruised over to the bar area. about 3 watress walked by us without saying anything. No "hello"s or "have a seat" or "we'll be with you shortly". Nothing! I felt awekward... Didn't want to just sit somewhere any get ignored (referrence: thread about couple getting arrested)  After wondering around, we ended up at the bar. Took few minutes for bartender to come over too. So by the time he came and took our order, it was happy hour! Yay for slow service!!!  Anyways... beer selection was awesome. Drink deals were not. I thought Happy hour means cheap beer? I guess not here. If there were, they didn't tell us.  I know it's a wing store and we should get wing. But nothing on their menu sounds good other than wings. Why do you even have other food items? Wings it is... So my friend didn't know how big the wings were, it was more like a drum stick, he ordered a dozen. 2 of 6 flavors. They were pretty good.   The evening went pretty well, just like any other sports bar, but way too bright inside. Bright light + drinking = headache. So almost closing time, a guy next to us offered to buy us drinks. Not just a drink, but Irish car bomb. OMG worst hangover ever. I had to leave my car there and call a cab. When a patron says "no, I don't need more drink" the good bartender shouldn't serve more drink. Even though obnoxious guy offer to buy them. Let's think safety before upselling.   Wings were good, but I won't go back.

Ok, I've been there 3 times now. Twice on Saturday, one on Friday.   First 2 times we were there, service was horrible. The servers were rude, very slow, and didn't really care.   First time we went there, it was Saturday. We got there 10 til 10. I tried to flag someone so we could get food order in before the late-night menu started. First girl I talked to said they were not serving food. I asked if they were serving late night menu then, she said "Ya, but I don't know where the menu is" and walked away.  We waited for few minutes but nobody came to our table, so we gave up and couple of us got drinks from bar (after 10 minutes of waiting at the bar too) Few minutes after, our server came to us and said "Where have you been? I was waiting for you all to sit down" Well, One of my friend was sitting at the table for the whole time and the server didn't go over for like 15 minutes, it just sounds like an excuse. We finally got late night menu, which was a one page print out of like 5 things... We got wings, Reuben sliders, and fish and chips. Wing and Reuben came out first. Wings were alright. It was too crispy for my taste and flavor was so-so. Reuben slider wasn't so tasty. Meat was dried out and bun was too hard. Fish and chip came out about 10 minutes later. It was 1 fish. One chunk of fish that was very over done (dark dark brown). Did kitchen guy forgot to take it out of the fryer? Or did server forgot to bring it out and it got cold so they had to fry it again? Either way, it wasn't so good. Chips were very greasy too. And speaking of server... she didn't know what half and half was, or black and tan... she kept asking which beer we wanted. Overall, we weren't happy.   Second night was 2 weeks later, on a Friday night.  Walked in, got ourselves a table, different server. Let's see if this night is any better than last time. Nahhh, it was still the same.  We ordered drinks, asked for a menu (unfortunately late-night menu again) and waited... She came back with drinks, no menu. So we asked again. Her response was, "Oh, you want menu? I'll be right back" She said that first time we asked for a menu! Anyways, she got menu... and disappeared for 20 minutes. You know... if somebody asks for a menu, doesn't it mean that somebody is hungry and wants to order a food? Maybe? Anyways, she wasn't paying attention, so my buddy got up, grabbed a random server that's standing by POS, and asked to put an order of wings in since our server is MIA. As he was sitting down, I see our server getting up from another table across from ours, walked towards us, and said  "Oh, did you want to order food?" so we replied with  "Yes, we asked for menu because we wanted to order food. But you were gone for 20 minutes, so we decided to find somebody else"  So then she responded with  "Oh, I'm sorry we are slammed. I just got like 10 tables."  Hmmmm, I just saw her get up from other table which I could see and she was there for good 5 minutes. What a way to give us an excuse! And we are not stupid, people were leaving, not coming in. The place had half the people compare to when we came in.  And also she was blaming other server for doing her job. Oh, and my buddy asked her what the writing on the wall meant. It was in Celtic. She was running around all over to find what it meant. She failed though... My comment on that was  "If only she tried that hard to get our order and drinks right..."  So... the second visit was a bad one too...   The next day! 3rd time is a charm. We'll give it a one final chance before we give up on this place.  Walked in, got a table right in front of the stage. (We also went 2 nights in a row to see The Biffos play) This time, a server came right away to take our order! So the night started good. She took rally good care of us, got our food, and checked on us more than other 2 servers combined. Later of the visit though, she was getting slower, but I could also see she had other tables she was tending. That's fine. She wasn't making up story about how it got mysteriously busy with no people.  After 3 visits, I give 2 star. The food wasn't something to rave about and service was way below average. I would rather go to other bars with cheaper Guinness and better service.

I couldn't make it to Great Wall for some Dim Sum, so my family came here for lunch. They recently changed hands, Koi( next building over)'s owner owns this place. Korean style Chinese food.  When we pulled into parking spot, one of the owner was smoking right outside the door. I gave him dirty look (where's 20 feet away from door?) We had kids and pregnant woman, so I'm not a fan of smoke.  There's about 10 tables inside. Very tiny store. Ordered cha jang myun( noodle with black bean sauce), seafood champong, tang soo yook (sweet and sour pork) pal bo che ( spicy seafood in brown sauce). All tasted good. Bay scallop had little bit of fishy taste to it, but other than that, it was good.   1 waitress, 1 cook, so each plate of food came out every 5 minutes. Food is big, so you can share too.   After stuffing outselves, total bill came out to $88 (pre-tip) between 5 adults, 2 kids.

They have a new and improved menu and added more Korean dishes. Very good!!! I've been there 4 times since they added the new menu, and it's been good every time. Very authentic Korean food. This is my favorite spot now!!  The dishes I had so far: Champong, Bulgogi, Sul-lung-tang, Neng-myun, Galbi, Yukgejang. All were very good. I can't wait to go back and try other food! Neng-myun (cold noodle) was especially good on muggy hot summer days.

This place has great concept, but very poorly executed.   I took my 16 month old around noon on Wednesday. I had to wait about 5 minutes to be checked in. I saw that there are 3 areas designated for 3 age groups, but was not enforced by staff or parents, so bigger kids are running all over the place. Couple of the boys were throwing the cushions around for good 10 minutes before a male staff came to stop them. Unfortunately kids weren't listening to him because the staff that came over seemed to be autistic and couldn't tell kids to stop. There were 2 other staff but they never left the cafe area. Most of the time they were in the back area.   I went up to order some food for my son, one female staff was helping other guest, so I waited. When it was my turn, she said "I'll be right back. I just need to check them in real quick" Well, the people kept coming in, so she never came back to take my order. I didn't want to leave my son alone for too long, so I gave up on getting food.   There were LOTS of parents sitting around either on their phone or talking to their friends and not paying attention. I tried my best to stop any bigger kids from pushing my son over. I think my son had fun, but it was pretty stressful for me. I saw one kid bite other kid in the crawler area. Like draw blood, bite.   The faculty itself is in good shape for what it is. Little beat up, but that's the nature of business.   Overall,    4 star for facility 2 star for service 1 star for other patents and kids Can't rate the food, since I couldn't order.   It would be much better if there were more staff to cover each station.

I love Chipotle. I drive by this location everyday, so you can imagine how excited I was when I saw the banner with "coming soon" sign.   When they finally opened, I was there within the first week. I can say I've been there more than 10 times so far and there were few times (3 or 4 times) I just walked out of there because their food just did not look fresh. Chipotle is known for its fresh ingredients and meat, but not this location. I love barbacoa, but every time I go, they just look dry or too greasy. Same with pork as well. I got lucky and was able to get fresh steak right off the grill, but everything else looked so bad and their mild salsa (pico de gallo) ended up being too sour. Also the rice was not made right. One time I complained about portion as well. The girl at the counter was only putting half scoop. I was there yesterday around 5pm and walked out empty handed again. I wish they'd step up and pay more attention to their food quality because I love Chipotle and this is right around the corner from my house and to work. I will continue to try until their food is consistent and update my post when they do.

I expected much more being a brand new store.   All of the previous reviews were surprisingly good, but I doubt they shop at Asian store every week to know the small differences. It may not smell *yet*, because it just opened, but I saw a lot of fly in the store, and meats/ vegetables did not look "amazingly fresh". (I noticed brown spots on meat)  Their price weren't impressive either. Everything I saw today was more expensive (compare to what I usually purchase from other stores). Also thought their aisles were unorganized. It just seemed like everything was scattered everywhere.   We'll see how they keep up.

I was very excited when I found out that Oregano's is opening up in the west side, which I have been asking for almost 10 years. I expected to have a long wait just like any other Oregano's I've been to.   That said,  My first visit to this location was couple weeks after they opened. I ordered Beefstro salad and Bollo Pasta. They had no knowledge of menu at all... When I asked the hostess how long it was gonna take, she said it'll be 45 minutes. I replied with "for a salad and pasta?" right then, the manager was walking by and overheard my question and said, "no, not for a salad and Bollo Pasta, it'll only be 10-15 minutes". That sounded better, so I walked over to the bar, which only has 4 tightly close seats, saw that they were all taken, of course, just ordered my drink and stood in the walk-way. There were no other place to wait for food and outside waiting area was WAY over crowded. After 45 minutes..... (hostess was right) I finally got my food and took it to my work (good thing I had plenty of time before my shift) opened my food and I couldn't find any beef on my Beefstro salad. Just a big box of greens! So I called... and surprisingly the hostess knew that I was missing my beef and asked me to come back and get them (She said she had it right there and forgot to put it in my bag). I was already at work so I wasn't able to. If they had not taken so long to get my food in the first place, I probably had came, but no. So she puts me on hold and gets the manager. He tells me to come get the meat. Again, I said I can't. So then he said he will give me a salad for free next time I come in. So I said sure. I couldn't stop by to get the salad, so I called up again and he just mailed me a $15 gift card (one week later).   Second visit (to use my gift card).  It was around 1 pm on Saturday. There were 2 hour wait for a table. I walked around and saw that the couple on the bar was about to leave. Stood behind them so I could grab their seat as they leave. (woo-hoo no wait!!)  The bartender was so busy/inexperienced/stressed/overwhelmed that it took him 10 minutes to greet us.10 minutes for our beer. Another 10 minutes to take our order. Not to mention other people trying to order drinks while they wait leaning over our shoulders and standing next to us the entire time... I like sitting at bar for easy of ordering. Not this time. Watching him made me uneasy for how stressed he was. I got my salad, Pizza Cookie (they changed the name?) and left. Unpleasantly  Third visit.... did not happen because I called to make a take out order and was told that it will take an hour for a Beefstro Salad. Just like some of the other reviews I saw, food is good, but 1 hour wait for a salad is bit absurd.    Very disappointed!!!

Brand new sushi restaurant in Arcadia! Inside looks very trendy. They are waiting on liquor license, so no sake bomb with sushi today, but it looks like an awesome spot for happy hour.    Tried their spicy tuna (my go-to roll for basing quality), Climax roll, Amigo roll, and Dragon roll. All are right on the dot!  Spicy tuna has good spice to it and sauces are yummy as well. The shrimp and eels were still warm. There were only 2 other tables, so service were fast. my server was still training, so they couldn't answer everything, but still very nice.   I would definitely come back

This place is a must try breakfast restaurant. Very friendly staff, our cashier was very helpful, nice atmosphere, gorgeous patio and the most importantly, great food. Presentation was nice, and the flavor is even better.  We ordered French toast, Arepas, House hash, savory crepe, and special of the day.  Each dish was very unique and flavorful without over saturated in butter or salt. Everything tasted fresh.  We sat out in the patio which was very nicely shaded and cozy.  They also serve vegetable/fruit infused water, which was very refreshing.  Tried some pastries (bear claw, pecan bread, and cookie) and they were delicious as well.  Definitely recommend this place if you like healthy breakfast that tastes amazing.
