I have to say, wow how bad can you get.  Yes the building is pretty, but everything else is of the poorest quality.  The staff is inattentive, the food greatly over priced and poorer than fast food quality.  We ordered a "Classic" California roll and were very surprised that is was not in fact a California roll (enough lemon flavored mayo to choke a horse).  Our entr√©e which consisted of two salads took over half an hour to arrive, and seriously could have gotten larger fresher salads for half the price at Wendy's.  I ordered the Chicken Club salad, the mixed greens were wilted, the chicken sparse and mostly batter, two small cubes of avocado, and the bacon was leathery not crunchy.  My wifes salad had rotisserie chicken that was hastily pulled from the chicken and included connective tissue, fat and congealed blood.  While waiting for and eating our meal we observed two tables beside us have at least three employees stop by to chat for more than ten minutes at a time.  After our meal we sat and waited for 15 minutes for our server to come by with our check and then another 10 before we could flag down what looked like a manager to take our money.  It took another 10 minutes to get our change.  It was nice however to have the tip amounts printed on the receipt so that we knew what not to give.  I really liked Houston's the few times I was there, Hillstone I will not be returning to.

Changed hands from Big Bell Road Kia to Earnhardt Kia from a Friday to a Monday with no warning. All new staff and no records from the previous owners. Had an appointment to take our new car in on the 23rd of August for some problems that Big Bell Road Kia had agreed to fix. Service had no record of our appointment, nor what was to be fixed, after some discourse they said they would take care of us, parts would be ordered, things would be scheduled and we would get a call. Two and a half weeks later and nothing has been done and the Manager is claiming they no nothing about it, and it was like we were never there on the 23rd. I am sure we are not the only people in this situation over the transition with this dealership. Now we are left with a messed up new car and no way to get it fixed, unless we go somewhere else and pay out of pocket.

Do not go here unless you absolutely need to see a band.  I went last night, and luckily didn't have to pay for any tickets (I won them).  Venue is dirty beyond belief, like I don't want to touch anything for fear of disease dirty.  Hot, hot, hot, in a bad way.  If you are going to have a non smoking venue you need to enforce that, all kinds of people smoking on the concert floor.  Sound, was mediocre at best.  Parking was a rip off, and I don't think they even own the lot.

Decided on a whim at the last minute to go here for dinner tonight, I guess that's not the thing to do here.  Worked out perfect though, arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn't open till 5pm.  After a short debate we decided to stay, it helped that there was ample shade.  The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part, newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order.  40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town.  I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night.  Reservations are usually 1 1/2 to 2 months out.  Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone.  5 o'clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after.  Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course.  I could not have asked for much more from my food, maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad, everything was amazing including my Mexican coke.  We ordered 2 pizzas, both wood fire baked to perfection.  I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads, or for $2 on its own.  None of our food was greasy or soggy, the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering.  I will go back again, planning on getting there an hour before opening.  Although the food is amazing and well worth an hours wait in the Phoenix sun and heat, I would not wait for 4 to 6 hours as some people do.  So for me this was a win and a lucky last minute dinner decision.

We went here for our Anniversary yesterday, our first time to Trader Vic's.  Overall I was not impressed.  We had the Crab rangoons as an app and I found it very strange that they were served with a plate of mustard and seafood sauce, kind of weird.  I had the Passionfruit glazed chicken, which while tasty, barely had any chicken and for what it was, priced way too high.  My wife had the macadamia nut crusted mahi, the fish was very good, the brocolini cooked perfect, but the mashed potatoes were pasty and had a bitter sour aftertaste.  Desert wasn't any better, the bread pudding was dry and rubbery and obviously microwaved and the Snowball, come on 8 bucks for a scoop of ice cream rolled in coconut?     Service was horrid, we felt neglected waiting for drinks and food and then rushed once our meal came.  Some kid brought us salads we never ordered and then our waitress tried to take them to the right table only to upset the people at that table (they could see the salads at our table first).  The same kid tried to deliver our app to the same table instead of us.  Waitress kept asking us if we were done and then brought the check without asking if we wanted dessert first.  The place wasn't even busy and it felt like they were trying to turn the table.  We enjoyed ourselves in spite of the food and service, because we had each other.  I would rate one star higher, but for the price I expect so much more.  Not worth it at half the price.  I will only go back if it is someone else's choice, it won't be mine.

The first time I as here was years ago and only for a couple of drinks after a show at ASU Gammage.  As I remember it was not very busy even then.  Last Friday we ventured into Boston's after plans we had didn't work out, as it turns out we should have just gone home.  On a Friday night at 7:00pm this place was empty, I thought we got lucky, not so much.  We ordered an appetizer which was tiny and expensive and not very good.  I won't really go into what we got for dinner, because really what's the point?  The food was barely edible.  The service was seriously lacking as well, it seemed like our waitress was even lest interested in being there than we were.  We will not return.

We have been meaning to try Pan Asia for some time now, but didn't get around to it until last night, and I am glad we did.  Location is great for us as it's on the way home and has lots of parking.  The dinning area is comfortable and not crowded at all. The food was very good and I look forward to trying more of the dishes they offer.

This was one of my favorite pizza places, I love thin crust. I was shocked today to see that this location was closed. I was just by a few days ago. Everything was still in the restaurant, just doors closed and a notice on the door that they were a victim of the economy. They were always busy, I don't understand.

Just had these guys out not even an hour ago.  Very rude, very pushy, tracked mud into my house and left the front door wide open when I went to show them the thermostat.  I have 2 cats, leaving the door wide open was not cool.  These guys treat you like you're an idiot, I told the them the thermostat was on they didn't believe me, so I showed them. One guy told the other to check the filter, I told him it was clean, it had just been changed, he didn't believe me.  I called and complained after I had them leave, the woman on the phone actually told me it was not their responsibility to close the door behind them.  If these guys told me they had a checklist they needed to follow, I would have understood, they did not tell me this, they just kept trying to push past me into my house.  When I saw they had left the door open it was the last straw. Common courtesy would have been to put something over their boots so as to not track mud in my house and to close the door behind them as they entered.  This was actually the second time I have has this company to my house, the first time they didn't fix the problem. The first time they were here, they didn't need to check the filter. The first time they were here, the guy just kept opening the door and walking into my house without knocking, I have never had this happen with a repair person before.

Like Melanie if I could give this dealership less than one star I would. In our case everything went well until we went to pick up our new car. We were told the car would be inside waiting for us, when we got there it was outside, no big deal. Our substitute salesman offered to pull it inside to go over it, we declined thinking it would take just a couple minutes outside and we would be on our way. To cut to the chase, the salesman didn't wait to move another vehicle in the way and drove our new car off the curb and messed up the front fascia. The salesman and Manager tried to brush it off as no big deal. When they offered to patch and paint the fascia and not replace it, we got our money back and shredded the deal and they didn't even care.  I am guessing they will just sell the car as new and never disclose the damage.
