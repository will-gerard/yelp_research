This is an excellent local liquor store. They have a huge selection of liquor and beer and sell kegs, etc. But they also have a cellar with hundreds of bottles of wine and a wine bar and tasting events. Super friendly staff. Not the absolute cheapest in town but its very reasonable and the good atmosphere and service makes it worth shopping at.

I heard good things about this place, but was terribly disappointed. I ordered the thin crust pizza, and while the cheese was good, the crust was somehow both cardboard and dry and also soggy. Paid $18 for what I thought was a gourmet pizza, but it was more like a frozen Red Barron.   Pizza was delivery.

Update to previous review:  The restaurant graciously heard my concerns and quickly resolved the situation. My second meal was excellent. Thank you!

Excellent place for meal or drinks. Ive yet to order a dish that i have not enjoyed, but the green curry is my fav. Thai tea is blended just right. And, they have $2 draft Kirin beer. Yes please!

This place is amazing. Not sure what else to say, if you haven't been, you should go.

Nice local burger shop. Food was good. I had a bacon cheeseburger combo, it included a fountain drink and thick cut fries. Excellent quality. Good bun. Fries were good. No complaints. However, they have a big menu (lots of delicious sounding things!) and there are no descriptions of what each item is. But whatever, its a nice place, local ownership, and its quality.

A+ Mechanic. I brought my Scion TC in for new shocks and struts. The staff was exceptionally friendly. They made me feel comfortable with the experience. The price was way better than the dealership quote (almost half the price) and they threw in a free oil change. The work was done well. No problems. I will definitely be back. This is my new mechanic shop.

I took my dog to the self serve dog wash here. It was nice. The staff were super friendly and laid back, made me feel comfortable even with my clumsy dog. They had "eco-friendly" wash stuff which is cool, but i felt like something was missing from the setup... Not sure what. For 15 bucks it seemed a bit scrimp. But despite all that I would probably go back because they are cool and my dog did come out clean.

This place is legit. I eat here at lunch a couple times a week. All of the food is substantial - big portions of quality meat, and is reasonably priced. The battered shrimp and battered fish tacos are huge, and with big, meaty shrimps in an awesome beer batter. So good. The loaded fries are amazing. Decor is sparse, but place is super clean and modern-industrial vibe.
