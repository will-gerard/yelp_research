I actually stopped by there to get gas at the Valero Gas Station with my "cracked windshield" that was fixed several weeks prior. I got out of my SUV and not one but 3 vultures approached me. The first vulture approached me and I smiled and told him "Oh, I'm just here to get gas. Thank you." The next vulture, "Why don't you give me your insurance card and I'll have that crack in your windshield fixed?" Caught off guard because I was simply there to fill up my tank, I politely told him "No, thank you." Offended, the d'bag countered rather forcefully that it wouldn't cost me anything and why didn't I care about my car? Again, pumping my gas as quickly as I could (and not completely filling my tank), I told him "No, thank you."  And then came the encore, as if his ego somehow couldn't bear to be told "NO" again-- as if he been told NO for the 100th time that day. I'm generally a pretty quiet and easy going person but I really wanted to punch this guy in the face!!! Do these people at Valero really think they are using effective methods to sell their product?!?! OB freakin NOXIOUS!!! The goober's friend/coworker (I will call him Vulture numero tres) hoping to sneak in a sell  and  seal the deal, apologized for his friend's behavior. At that point I was D O N E! I will never go there again and I will tell all my friends how sleazy and pushy that Genie Car Wash/Valero Gas Station is!! It's amazing how many people I have told that have had the same experience. Way to be despicable and lowly, Valero!!

The first time I heard of Serena was by word of mouth from one of her clients, who said "Serena will make your skin sing!". I had just had a baby and hadn't quite figured how to get out of the house and take care of my skin with my firstborn in tow. I did my very first post- partum facial with Serena. I took my little guy in his little carry on while Serena worked her magic on my face. She was so patient with me when I needed to get up and tend to him. I would never recommend bringing your infants to a facial but if you ever *had* to do it, Serena is the most accommodating around.  7 plus years later, I still bring my 2 children with me if I am desperate and don't have child care.  Through the years, I have had different skin issues come up and she always has a solution that works. She is a boundless sea of information and very knowledgeable about skin and how to care for it. It doesn't hurt that she is kind, professional, flexible, and would bend over backwards for her clients. When you walk into the spa, the vibe  is as warm and welcoming as she is.  I am not only a regular client for facials and peels but I also see Serena for my eyebrow waxes. She is precise and whenever I get my make up done or sometimes even random strangers compliment the shape of my eyebrows!   I adore Serena and her charming, cozy spa and I will be a forever loyal client as long as she will have me.

Close to my house and convenient but I would rather drive out of my way to another place than go here again. I got the worst manicure I've ever had! Not only was the nail tech rude, it would appear I ruined his day because I am a stay at home mom with 2 little ones and a part time job.  Upon sitting down, the tech asked me why I wasn't at work. When I went into my day as a mom and part time job as a nurse, he literally didn't care. His response was "uh huh".  By the way, he had some pit funk going on and I had to bite my tongue to ask him why he didn't shower that day. He started cutting my cuticles and boy, did he have some aggression he needed to get out! Ya think when someone's nails bleed and you have to wipe it off with a tissue, maybe you cut a little too deep?  His hand massage was awful. He did this thing where he pulled out each finger one by one so vigorously I thought he was going to yank my finger out of the socket.    I will never go there again. End of story.
