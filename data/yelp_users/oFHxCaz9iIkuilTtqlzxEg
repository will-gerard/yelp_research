My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVED staying at the Hyatt! We are all about being in an upscale but relaxed/fun environment which the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch definitely is! Our number one favorite thing about the hotel: the pool area! It is huge with amenities for every kind of person: water basketball, water volleyball, slide or you can relax in wading pools, and literally, every day of our vacation during the Labor Day weekend, as packed as the pool was, we always got a lounge chair and could even find a corner of a pool to ourselves. The second best thing about the hotel is the size of the rooms! A regular room is HUGE and we had a wonderful view of the lake that surrounds the hotel. The third best thing about the hotel is their nightly live entertainment. I love that you don't even need to leave the hotel if you don't want to. One night they had a spanish band and the next night they had jazz, and the next they had a Native American hoop dancer. All of the staff at the resort were extremely friendly and helpful. This place is great for adults only or for families! We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Arizona.

This place was AWESOME! I could not get over how friendly everyone at the restaurant was ("Oh, you haven't been here before? Let me give you a tour") and if you had to wait for a table, they would serve your beverages while you are waiting. We ordered the spinach salad and added shrimp (which were basically huge grilled prawns) which was delicious and then a simple small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The crust was thin and crispy and the pepperoni and mushrooms were baked under the cheese so that you would not lose any of the toppings on to your plate! Just the regular salad and small pizza was enough to stuff both me and my boyfriend! You cannot go wrong at this place, our best lunch experience in Scottsdale.

We came here for the happy hour (because we couldn't afford the dinner menu) and it turned out to be a great experience. We originally came here because we saw it featured as one of the "best places for patio dining" and truly, the views were spectacular (although we couldn't sit outside since it was 110 degrees!). We ordered margaritas and for food the potato chips, quesadilla, and mini burgers. All were delicious and had generous portions. The staff was also very friendly and attentive.

This place had such high reviews on Yelp that we drove all the way from Scottsdale on our vacation to Tempe to visit this place. And it was worth it! From the front doorman asking me for my ID (knowing I'm well over 30) to saying my name right and telling us to have a great time, to the bartenders asking every few minutes if we were OK, to the delicious blue cheese burger, we were happy campers the entire time. I'm not a beer drinker, but my boyfriend tried all 3 beers and loved all of them. It's a fun, casual, sports bar environment and a great place for bar food.

Absolutely my favorite hotel in all of Vegas! They have the best pool (a beach with a wave pool and a lazy river) and the crowd is perfect if you are in your 30's (i.e., Hard Rock and Palms are for the 21-year olds and MGM is for families) and they have so many restaurants to choose from, great attractions like concerts on the beach, the lion king play and the Shark Reef aquarium. Our rooms are always comfortable, lush and quiet and the service is impeccable.

We came here because Geisha a Go Go across the street was absolutely packed. We sat at the bar and right off the bat, the bartender did not seem like she wanted to be there although she was catering big time to the male only clientele. My boyfriend ordered an Asahi beer and even specified "beer" not sake, because that's a common mistake, and after waiting 10 minutes for her to deliver it, she still came out with sake and not beer. Then I ordered the Crispy Tuna, and after waiting another 15 minutes for it, she came out with the spicy tuna roll and realized her mistake after setting it down and said she'd get me the right order. While we are waiting for about 20 minutes for our order, everyone around us who came in AFTER us is getting roll after roll, finally we told her if it hasn't been started, just cancel it. She said "I think they started it - let me check..." then came back out and said yes, they started making it. 15 minutes later, she checks again and came back out and said "I'm sorry, for some reason a big table got their order in before you so it's not ready yet". We cancelled the order all together. StingRay gets 2 stars because the bartender comped us our beer and soda. P.S. WAY, WAY overpriced for what it is!

I love the newly remodeled Joint! Especially since I'm short, General Admission is not a fun option for me, however, the floor is tiered (so that even if you are in the back, you will still be about 2 feet higher than the people in front of you). We saw Linkin Park here and surprisingly, except for the pit area, the rest of the crowd was pretty respectful and not pushing even though it's still general admission floor. I can't complain about anything - great acoustics and really nice place to see a band!

If there was a rating system for price, I'd give this place a 2 but being that every restaurant on the strip and in a hotel is expensive, I'll just level the playing field and ignore the price. In terms of the food and atmosphere, it was great! For an appetizer we ordered the edamame hummus which came with chips (although not enough and when we asked for just a few more chips, when we got the bill they charged us $3 for extra chips - not cool - you should tell us there is going to be a charge first). We also ordered the cod and the spider roll - both extremely good! I guess if we had gotten there just an hour earlier we could have gotten the same thing for half price - but oh well, good to know for next time!

I had really hoped this place would be better since the location was great (right in the middle of Old Scottsdale) and the inside looked nice, but that was about as far as it went. Although our waitress was nice, the service took FOREVER, and the place was not even full at lunch time. $10 for a regular margarita at lunch time seemed a little pricey to me too. We split the 3 taco plate and had a fish taco, lobster taco and carne asada taco. Both the fish and lobster tacos were fried, not lightly fried, but heavily battered and greasy. The carne asada did not have a lot of flavor. Probably OK to go here in a pinch, but there are probably hundreds of places better than this!

We spent almost a week in Scottsdale and by far, this was my favorite restaurant! Although there are about 7-10 traditional sushi rolls, it's really about the grilling menu that makes it so unique. I also love the open dining area and you can see the chefs preparing your food on the robata grill. We ordered the soft shell crab roll and pork belly for appetizers - very tasty. For dinner we shared the Black Cod Miso and that was my very favorite thing on the menu! Light, buttery and sweet, and grilled. We loved our dinner so much we ended up coming here two more times during our trip but ate at the bar for happy hour (5pm-10pm!). I would have given it 5 stars, but the portions were just a wee bit small for the price (a black code skewer was $5 at happy hour, but literally it was like 2 bites big!). Check out the block of ice in the bar and how the bartender cuts it for shochu drinks...pretty interesting to watch!
