I've always liked Luke's, it's authentic Italian beef...how can you go wrong! Well, today was the exception. Spent $25.00 for two beef sandwiches, with everything, two pepsi's (medium) and a large order of fries. Just seems too high for a couple of sandwiches. Hey, I could have gone to Capital Grill for not that much more.   Beef was somewhat bland today. Fries were awesome as usual, forgot to ask them to make them extra crispy...but they are good.  I'm going to take a Sabbatical from Lukes to check out more interesting places.

Fine Dining is hard to find and Capital Grill ranks right up there. It's my favorite spot for a great steak and large selection of wines. I judge a steakhouse by trying the Rib-Eye. Capital Grill only serves "Prime" and yes, you do pay the price. This is not a "cheap date", and has become one of special occasion spots...anniversary, birthday etc.   The Rib-Eye here has the perfect marbleization and has always been cooked to perfection. Sandra K usually has the Filet, and has never been disappointed.  But I better mention the Lobster Bisque soup before detailing the steaks and sides. It is like a special sunset. Dazzling light, luminescent colors and a special moment. Not sure how's it's made...but to die for flavor. Salads are exceptional, except I usually go for the soup, but when I'm thinking healthy, I have the wedge or Caesar, or on occasion the bacon spinach. All worth mentioning.  Back to the steaks, again, I am a Rib-Eye fan but I have had The Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre with a Courvasier Cream Sauce. This steak is rubbed with crushed peppercorns and "seared" to lock in the juices. The cream sauce is such a delight. Don't mix the Lobster Bisque and this steak unless you want a decadent evening.   By the way, don't lke beef? Try the Double Cut Lambchops...fabulous! Seafood, I can't get myself to order seafood at a Steak House, unless I have Steak and Lobster/Crab. Then again, I get my Lobster fix with the soup or the appetizers.  Sides....This is why I like to take a group here. The sides are all "shareable" although there are several here that I don't want my companions to take too much. Parmesan Truffle Fries....ouch on the flavor scale (and other scales). Lobster and Mac N Cheese, again, I get my seafood on the side, this one is decadent to the power of 10 and one of my all time favorites are the AuGratin potatoes. To impress my guests, I will order a vegetable to share and it's usually the creamed spinach or asparagus. But sliding into decadence here means I throw out the rules of engagement and if I going to sin....here I am going to sin big, and that means dessert as well.  Coconut Cream Pie or Key Lime Pie at a fine dining spot contrast the other offerings of Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake and Berries and Cream. Go for it.  I have had intimate dining here with Sandra K and most recently, hosted a luncheon for 60 persons in a private setting. Service has always been impeccable and the food is distinguished.

I give the Bamboo House a favorable rating. It's my local Chinese food haunt. Giant fan of their Hot and Sour soup. I judge a Chinese restaurant based on a few dishes and Hot and Sour is one. Personally, I think it may be the best in the valley. Another favorite of mine is there Mongolian Beef and hey, Larry can do Thai there too. Pad Thai....It's better than some of their Thai brethren. The pan fried noodles are scrum-delicious and when I want to elevate my blood sugar, I go for their Sweet and Sour Pork. Egg Foo Young is a nice addition. Portions are always large and yes, I take home what I can't eat and have Noodles and Eggs...could be an idea for a chain.   When I want really good Chinese, I mean really good, I have to go to Orange County around Garden Grove in the mean time, I'm a fan of Sam Phan (yes, the owners name is Sam Phan)....

Yesterday was National Hamburger day, so it was my patriotic duty to partake in this directive. I was greeted by a smiling hostess and proceeded to the bar where an NBA playoff games was playing on the flat screen TV. I made it in time for happy hour but no hamburgers other  than sliders were on the menu.   The Hawaiian is what I wanted and at around $9.00 I was ok since it came with Onion Rings. Order arrived with 4 yes 4 onion rings. I asked the bar tender/ waitress if this was it, and she assured me it was. She did offer me another side but I said no. Disappointed with the onion rings, I cut my hamburger in 1/2 and proceeded to eat. Frankly it was boring, slice of pineapple a bit of Teriyaki and 3/8" slice of onion on a bun that was as boring as the hamburger. Waitress brought me 4 more onion rings which were the highlight of the meal. Unfortunately, others arrived at the bar, a heavily tattooed Mohawk wearing individual with girlfriend. Every-other word was F this F that. Ate my burger drank my Blue Moon @ $5.75 for 16 oz. The bill  came to $16.33 and I left a $20. Sorely disappointed with this chain that lost its way. 4 stars to the waitress who knew how to handle a disgruntled customer. In and Out would have been a better choice.

Weil it was my first trip to The Breakfast Club and I ate real healthy but I did oodle the Eggs Benedict and friend to the right of me ordered it and I was jeoulous. The Eggs Benedict looked "Scrumdelicious"!!!! I  had eggs poached with bacon and fruit. Great price at $5.95 and plenty of food for me. Bacon was not scrimpy but nice and thick, crisp and perfect! Maybe as a reward for myself, after I finish running the 1/2 marathon, I'll eat a big breakfast on Monday. Looking to give it the fifth star it probably deserves. By the way, it's worth the wait....and you will wait at this place.

My first time at Razz last night with a group of 25. They really brought their "A" game to service us. I'm told that they are always busy...even on a Tuesday night. Hate going to a restaurant and it's 1/4 full. Scares me. This place was hoping and we added to it.   The space is done just about right...contemporary and not pretentious. We had plenty of choice on entree's (not the whole menu) and with 25 people in our group...I think I saw the bulk of the menu. I had the Bouillabaisse and guest to the right had the halibut and to the left had the short ribs. Immpressive portion was my first immpression on my dish and others as well. The broth was light, not chunky and heavy, perfect consistency as this is a soup and not a stew necessarily. Well, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well- flavors were subtle, no one flavor overpowered the soup, and the tomato base was light. I like a little more wine flavor coming through but was not disappointed. I wish I knew how to give a half star here because Razz is not at a 5 but it could get 4 stars here.   Oops....salad, very imaginative, and combined 8 or 9 ingredients and again, the portion was very immpressive. They have a long life in the restaurant business, get there and enjoy.

Well I feel conspicuous as well as comfortable. I'm 57 and don't match the average demographic sitting amidst the "Retro" inspired gathering place. I like it.....reminds me of some of the haunts in downtowns of Portland, Seattle and SF. Sandra K had a lovely latte (Sandra K is an artist, so it's the first thing she notices is how it looks). Second comment was "It could use another shot". I stuck with a $2.00 cup of coffee and an elegant slice of Quiche. 3 Cheese and Garlic that looked as good as it tasted. The crust was perfect...this crust could hold anything, Banana Creme, Lemon Curd, or Chocolate Pie, that it contained a garlicky Quiche was fun.  Like the communal tables...hip guy next to me inquired about my journal and that inspired a light and friendly conversation. Lux is demonstrating that we can have a downtown (mid town here) identity. This is great a great addition to our city and I am proud to say that I am a Lux fan.  All the best to the "Luxorians"

Needed a unique restaurant to host Sandra's birthday party and suggested we get a teppanyaki table as the grandkids would have a lot of fun at the table.   That suggestion was a hit! The kids eyes were "wide open" during the whole cooking demonstration and Poppy was a hero for taking them to this cool place.  Food was very good and had some outstanding appetizers and drinks. Sapporo keeps on delivering not only food but atmosphere. I have been there several times (without the kiddies) and the sushi is very good. Loved the Poki, Lamb Chops and Hoisin BBQ Ribs appetizers along with Sushi and Sashimi.   The Teppan Menu allows great combos whether steak and seafood or seafood and chicken. Can't really go wrong with any of the combinations. Wife decided to have the Emperor which includes Lobster and I had the Imperial. Everything was cooked to perfection and the kids thought this was the "coolest" birthday dinner and Jacob announced that this is where he wants to come. (Sorry Peter Piper!) Great experience.

Well Sauce hits the "spot" for me. I was amazed how quick the service is and how fast we get our pizza (well their  pizza does follow the laws of physics, THIN PIES COOK QUICK!). So if your're looking for deep dish....this is not spot. But if you like it thin, it's great. I tend to order the same item time and time again and it's the sausage with carmelized onions. Sandra K likes their salads, so it's a pizza and salad and we share. She likes a glass of red wine with her dinner. We share the pizza and salad (she won't let me drink her wine though) and I gotta tell you, it's plenty of food and I feel like I got real value for my money. Kudo's to Sauce!  This guy, Sam Fox, has a magic touch with most of his restaurantsl He is truly gifted by bringing his concepts to the greater Phoenix area.

If you live in Central Phoenix, there is a great food option near Sunnyslope. Corbins is that neighborhood spot that "hits the spot". Clean contemporary look serving American fare. Hamburger is great, big and bold and the Onion Rings are about the best in town! Nice collection of beer and wine to compliment any of the meals. Try the ribs....meaty and falling off the bone. Very good fish tacos. A bit pricey otherwise I might be there more often.

Been to their other locations, and did not know they were close to me. Shame on me. Wife brought home what was leftover from dinner. One bite of the chicken breast in the styrofoam box made me a believer. Just the right flavor and heat. The bacon on top....muy bueno! The right heat and flavor. If leftovers make an impression, can't wait for my first trip to their locale.

Went for dinner last night and it put a huge smile on my face. I really wanted the Cola and Pineapple Soy braised short rib roast, but the special was a Rib Eye steak ($28) which we paired with the Empanadas  ($10)and Salmon Croquettes  ($11) for a wonderful dinner for 2 and leftovers enough for a steak sandwich today for lunch. I could eat a bowl of mash potatoes here.....probably the best I've had and the green beans....crisp and flavorful.   Just fabulous! This is a quirky place that has been around a while and why I have not dined here is a mystery to me. But this is a must CenPho restaurant. Can't wait to dine on the patio.

I like Rumbi Island Grill. It's different from Chipotle, Baja Fresh, Pei Wei but in the same genre of food. Order and they serve it. Well, they are different in that what they offer you is to be different than what's out there. And to a lot of degree it is. You like it Hot....try the Jerk Chicken. You like in Island inspired, the pulled pork is just pretty darn good. You like the "Island Experience" get it with authentic Macaroni Salad....yes that is really Hawaiian having lived there for 5 years surfing big waves and being a fine artist there.   Sandra said today " The salads are better than Sauce"!!!!! That my friends is a giant endorsement coming from a "hard to please" person who has been stalking me for 35 years. Where else can you get Mahi Mahi?? It's blackened and very good. What is really neat is you can go Teriyaki or Jerk at the same time. Get noodles or brown rice on all their bowls. Pretty darn good for a change. Try it...you will like it.

I've been to Celsius a number of times and I've always enjoyed the food. The service has been uneven from time to time but I usually am at the Sushi Bar and when ever I'm at the Sushi bar, I meet new people and I guess I forget about how long my meal is taking. Don't get me wrong, this is a big part of my experience, that is the "art of service". But again, for some reason, the Sushi bar is to meet new people and time does not seem to matter.   They have a great assortment of sushi and sashimi and Joe C the owner has always been attentive to me as well as suggesting items from the menu. He has a comprehensive menu and it describes all the items and I find that helpful. I also think the price is right. Let's be honest here....Sushi is expensive. Try it, I think you will like it.

Well Chris Demarco has done it again! Great sense of "place" and food to match. Appetizer was Calamari and it was good... not great but good but not great.We got there for happy hour (before 7 PM) and had wine at $4.50 a glass, now that is nice.  I had the linguini with clams...you will not be disappointed. Companion ordered the Scampi and a caprese salad. Scampi was a 7.5 on a scale of 10 but the caprese salad was a solid 9.5. We both had deserts, companion with the gelato (good) and I took a "flyer" with the Olive Cake. Pleasant surprise with the Olive cake. I wanted something to soothe my sweetooth craving and I was skeptical. Very good. The cherries on the gelato.....wow! All in all 4 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers, entre's and two deserts around $115.00. Worth it!

Can anyone tell me how to get a 1/2 star. I've been to the "Hut" twice now and wish I could find out how to use a 1/2 star.   4 stars for food but I have to close my eyes so I don't have an acid flashback of a Denny's in LA after seeing Pink Floyd in I think 72.  We got an appetizer of the Chicken Satay....here is why I need to figure out 1/2 stars. This was the very best!!!!! I mean really, really good!   Wife had and I shared the # 58 and #68, I think. One was red curry with beef and it was 3.5. The other dish was a dish with a flat noodle, Chinese Broccoli and chicken. Out of this world. When I first saw the plate, I thought "Gonna have leftovers tomorrow" which is always a good thing. No leftovers on what ever that was. It was scrum delicious. Sandra K says she loves that kinda Wok burnt flavor that you get only with oriental cooking.  We topped it off by sharing a cup of homemade coconut ice cream and it was a perfect dessert to top off the dinner.  I wanted to have "Pla" like I get at Malee's but they don't make that, but I suggest that to Bee, one of the owners. I commented on the name "Hut" which to me is not endearing, but she has good memories of how they got their name. Hut to me is just not too endearing, but then again, I have been to some cutesy Thai named places to be very underwhelmed with the food.  So here goes; Food....4 and it can go to 4.5 Atmosphere and with a mouthful of wide noodles and eyes closed 4.5 Service.....3.5 Value and Price   4  Happy eating

I've been waiting for Pho Loc to reopen after their roof collapsed last year in a major rain storm. So hooray!!!  Seems like they expanded the menu here but I had to have my favorites and since I can't remember the names, I'll give you the Numbers's;73 and 43, uh this is the best I can remember so I will explain.  Barbecue pork, fried egg rolls in a giant bowl of rice noodles, served with a small bowl of very nice sweet sauce. Love the pork, very special, thinly sliced and grilled to perfection. Parts of the meat, nicley carmelized.The table has a bottle of Siracha hot sauce, a bottle of Hoisin and a hot chili sauce. I love the trio of sauces, very nice touch to have on the table. They may go out of business with customers like me sqeezing tablespoons of the delightful sauces all over my food. Sweet and hot, makes the mouth water.  The other dish has as a base, fried rice noodles and piled "High and Deep" are bok choy, broccoli, carrots, onions and shrimp and beef. The sauce is a rich blend of soy, ginger, fish sauce, ginger. This is one of my favorites. I love the crunchy rice noodles.  The owners are genuine people who love cooking their native foods and have the gift of hospitality. Yummy Yummy Yummy. Would like to see some Asian beers, so that is my suggestion here. You will not be disappointed.

Ok....this is along the line of the 3 D's...Diners,, Drive Inns.and Dives. When I think of some of the best Bar B Que I have had, it has been in some really off the wall spots. Well Stacy's is that kind of place. It's the "Real Thang". Stacy is a classical "Pit Boss" and Nicole is the front end Diva. This is real Bar B Que. Had the pulled pork sandwich, tender, sweet and soft. Then, I got hungrier and had to have the Beef Brisket. Man this is some of the tenderest beef I have ever had! Well, I had a chance to talk and tour the restaurant at which time, Stacy tells me he has a Bar B Que sauce for Diabetics. Well, yes....I am diabetic and probably should not have had the regular sauce...but every once in a while I "gotta" have the real thing. His Bar B Que Diabetic Sauce is almost as good as his regular sauce. I mean it!!!!!! Side orders....I had to have the sweet potatoe fries. I like Fez's better but his are all natural, with cinnamon and Brown Sugar. They have a lot of sides because besides being a BBq place,he's really know for Soul food. Tomorrow I'm going to consetrate on sides.....and he has fried chicken to die for. Anyway....I'm going to give this 4 stars. Only wish it had a bit more personality inside. He's getting there. Go try it!!!!!!

Well....I spend a lot of money on restaurants and eat at the best and the best dives. This one is close to the top of my list. It would get 5 stars if they had indoor eating, I froze my butt off but  the food really warmed me up couple that with the price and you've got a real winner here. Communal tables make for interesting conversations. Fish Taco's were a disappointment, maybe because they are not fried...tasted too "fishy", not like Rubio's. Parking sucks but park down the street and walk, it's well worth it.

I'm giving it 4 stars to start...they will have to work for he fifth star but they will get it. Sam Fox borders on "genius" and True Food is another masterful creation. The look...it's brash, fresh and it erased 5 years off my age. The vibe....well knows how to get the buzz in the community. Bathrooms....well he takes attention to detail about as far as you can take it at this point. By the way, True Food looks like it defies the recession and rightfully so. Positive Vibe. Kudos to you Sam.  Oh yes, the food. Well, it's a "healthy" offering, so I thought...could taste like so much of healthy food, bland, boring and I usually have to go to Jack in the Box and order 2 tacos to feel full. This is NOT case. I had the Turkey Burger. It was downright astonishingly flavorful and filling. The turkey was zestful and spicy. I was pleasantly surprised. Add to that, the side salad with Tuscan Kale....like a first kiss. Anyway, will be there for dinner this week and the fifth star is probably earned on that trip. Again, Sam....you had me at "hello".

The call came at 11:30 AM..."We're here at Park Central waiting for you to go to lunch downtown"." I said, lunch is tomorrow not today, but I said, OK, bee there in 10 minutes".  Friend says's he heard that Pasta Bar was good so let's try that. I said, yeah, there are 3 restaurants there, a Irish Pub (Turf) a Thai restaurant (Sens) and Pasta Bar. I said "Larry likes Thai"...Phil said, "Phil likes Italian" and that was the fateful decision.  I knew I was in trouble when we entered the restaurant and first, there was not a "sense of entry" nor anyone to greet us other than the strong smell of newly painted walls. Bartender said "sit where you like".   Two of us had the lunch special (about $12) and friend who suggested Pasta Bar ordered from the menu. His pasta was $15. Lunch special came with a drink. I will say, the pasta was very tasty, the salad had very good thought and fresh locally grown produce. Salad and pasta lunch special was served on the same plate which to  me was unappetizing. Lunch came with a very thin slice of bread. Bread was excellent but no butter. Server/bartender was made aware and out came a the smallest portion of butter I have ever been served and to be shared with all three of us. There was enough to cover half a Triscut wafer! Pasta was fresh, but without any meat.   The atmosphere is dark and we were told that it was to be an Italian diner. What added to the dark side was the art work. Andy Warhol images of Jim Jones, Rasputin, Christopher McVey and other icons of evil. The headache lingered on all day after I paid the bill for $52 for lunch. Hope they improve the portions, the service and the look. I would be hard pressed to come back.

It finally opened! The sign has been on the building for at least 3 seasons, maybe more, but the wait was worth it. We needed a breakfast spot in this central area sorely. The order system is like Pei Wei, line up and order at the counter get a number and sit down. Bad news, the wait was long, the good news, the food is great. I guess, I revealed that I'm impatient and want instant gratification. Thank God that they gave me a cup for coffee after we ordered and got our number to pin on the table on those "Alligator Clips". Every time I use those things, I flash back to the early 70's using those clips for that last toke that then gave the super munchies.  Coffee, $2.50 a cup for a bottomless cup with plenty of choices and in a to go cup. Atmosphere.....very hip look, open ceilings, nice patio, great colors and great sayings on the wall to remind us of cool sayings to remember while we nosh. Breakfast came pretty quickly considering how many people were in the restaurant . I had a breakfast burrito that was plump and was plenty of food. I just hoped for more....maybe those alligator clips reminded me of the munchies of the 70's. Sandra had a cinnamon roll and although I thought it could have been bigger....she enjoyed and said "It was fine and filling".  Saw several friends there, all overweight and they said the portions were very satisfying.   This is stupid but I love it. The Dyson hand dryers in the bathroom. They are the best. I'll be back for more and they can earn that fifth star I'm sure.

Not impressed. Side dining room was hidden and narrow, artwork was nice. place needs a facelift. Waitress was not knowledgeable nor very well trained. Pizza was ok but average ( was at CIBO recently) and if you compared to them there is no comparison. If you like average this is your place.

As the stars say..."As good as it gets". Carne Asada Tacos are the best, but I like to mix them up when I order, so I get the shrimp, chicken and pork for variety. Their hot sauce (red) is so good, I like to squirt it in my mouth (this is where Dumb and Dumber got if from), also the freshest guacamole in the valley. Breakfast is great here. I always have the flapjacks ($5.00) with real, authentic, bonafide, verifyable Maple Syrup, not colored corn syrup. The breakfast burrito is good for two and the coffee is so soul satisfying.  I'm going to work the rest of the menu till I try it all. This guys is a real artist and cares about his food and custumers. More, more, more like this is needed.

I was disappointed with the food. Service was good but there are some inattentitive things that bother me. All the little things add up that makes it hard for me to return. But let's start with the food.  Ah, cornbread to start. I love the cornbread as long as it isn't too sweet. The cornbread was great, not sweet, and to my surprise, little chunks of jalapeno mixed in, friend and I got one each of these delightful starts to lunch. Nice, very nice start to my anticipation of better things to come.  Lunch friend and I started with an appetizer of wings. They came out in an attractive basket (8 of them $7.95) so they are $1.00 a piece. Crispy fried with a sweet BBQ sauce and your usual celery and carrot sticks with what looked like ranch dressing. Now here is the experience once I "bit" into them....sweet but no smoke or taste to the wings, just the initial sugar rush, fried skin and then no flavor to the wing. Disappointed. I cannot figure out what the magic white sauce that accompanied the celery sticks is? Something whiteish, just not ranch, not mayonaise...like light mayonaise without taste, whatever it was, it remained in the bowl not eaten. Uh Oh, I said under my breath.  OK...so I said to myself "If you want good dough...go to a bank, or go to a bakery" If you want good wings...well go to the Native New Yorker and get all you want at around fifty cents and 31 flavors if you want.  Well, let's judge them by the BBQ, that is why I came here. So the way to sample BBQ is... the Sample plate, three meats at lunch (not including ribs I might add). Had to have their ribs, so got a few on the side plus the one sidedish which I chose coleslaw. Pulled pork, brisket, and chicken, plus the side of baby back ribs that I had to have. $12.95 plus $3.00 for the side of ribs. A little (and I mean little silver cup of BBQ sauce reserved usually for a side of horseradish)  Pulled pork....2 stars. brisket 2 stars, chicken 2 stars, ribs 2 stars, coleslaw, 3 stars.  Sorry, Bad to the Bone no pun intended is just that. I don't care about the decor, I don't care about mean waitresses (which in this case we had a sweet one) but just deliver me some good BBQ.

Well, I had high hopes for this place as this was my second visit and probably my last. Friend and I shared a 3 meat combo. No distinctives between  the pork, chicken or beef brisket. I will say the service was great, and the sauces were very good, but i like a smoke ring....it's why I like BBQ. Coleslaw was 4 stars and the beans were interestingly good. $22.00 for lunch for two with water. Sorry.....I've had better BBQ.

Well I have been waiting for Dillon's to open at the Top of Central. There have been several starts and stops there. I got there a few minutes past "happy hour" ...gosh darn it, but oh well I definitley had a hankering for BBQ. I asked them to bring me a Blue Moon, waitress apologized for not having a Blue Moon. How about a Stella? Absolutely, only to come back minutes later, "oh, we are out of Stella". I'll take water and the 2 meat platter with French Fries (don't let my wife know) and mac and cheese even though I wanted some cole slaw as well.   Meal arrived and my first impression, what a skimpy portion of mac and cheese but there were a lot of hand cut fries. Fries were served with a hummingbird serving of catsup, asked the waiter, bring me more and he complied. Had the Beef Brisket and St Luis style ribs with Cajun sauce.   Beef, dried out and very little sauce and none on the table. I was afraid to ask for more. Ribs were dried out as well with a bit of tangy sauce that I thought was pretty good. All told, I walked spending just under $20 dollars, no beer, not much sauce and pretty disappointed. Sorry, not going to be my Cue place even though it's in the neighborhood.   I want a cue place with great smoked meats, great sauces and value friendly. Not Dillons on Central.

Had great expectations for Jimmy's. Unfortunately, they did not meet my expectations for food. Had a lunch special with Mongolian Beef and brown rice, wonton soup, and an egg roll, around $9.00.  Nice atmosphere and personalities but that can't overcome the mediocre food. I hope they look at fixing the situation because these guys know how to deliver food and experience with Sting Ray.

Second visit to Timo this week. Had to make sure I was not dreaming about the first visit. First of all, last night's weather was perfect for outdoor dining. 86 degrees on the patio and that's where my two guests and I dined.  We started with drinks and proceeded to enjoy some Tapas. Mussels ($11.00) wings (not your ordinary bar wings) ($6.00)and a luscious Brie soup, so creamy ($8.00).Superb!   I had the Pancetta Flat Bread. This is the second time having this entre ($11.00), friends split the Prosciutto sandwich with kettle chips. "One of the best sandwiches I've ever had" remarked Michael. And the Pancetta Flat Bread...I'm hooked!  We thought it would be a good idea to split a couple of desserts, chocolate Crème Brûlée ($6.75) and Peach Cobbler ($7.00). Wow.  Liked Bomberos...love the Timo's.

Where do you get great BBQ when you are craving something like Brisket and you are in central Phoenix??? Circle H is the answer! I think Circle H's brisket could be the very best in the valley. I got so stuck on just the beef brisket that I did not try the other offerings. What a mistake because owner Bill Sandweg makes one of the best hambergers as well.   I've had the Pig and The Pastrami burgers. Let  me warn you, after eating one of these behemoth's, you either need to nap or forget about dinner if you have one for lunch. The Pig  burger at $10.00 comes with a choice of sides and generally err on the side of the fries. The fries are handcut and fresh. Does not get any better than that. You can definitley split the burger.   Pulled pork and chicken are all good choices but beef brisket is so good. Their BBQ sauce is very unique (only wish they would have it on the table, but I would drink it then) and they came up with a new mustard based Carolina sauce which is scrumdelicious.   This is a "Great" addition to local dining and a huge win for BBQ fans. Desserts, well have not gotten there yet because frankly, I can't eat another calorie for at least 4 hours.   Fifth Star will come when the interior gets completed with old photos from valley. They have many but looking for more.

Like so many, I anticipated the opening of Del Frisco at the Esplanade, replacing the very popular Houston's. The space has been transformed into something new and I enjoyed the vibe and the visuals. For that, I give it 4 stars.  But the food, well it started off with a mediocre appetizer and went downhill from there. I thought the steak portion was very skimpy....this is compared to The Capital Grill, Flemings or Donavon's. It was good but not as good as their competitors. I hope they get better.

Impromptu visit to Milagros yesterday as it has finally opened. In between lunch and dinner, but wanted to check it out anyway. Great vibe and rich look, they have really transformed this space.  Fixed my eyes on the Mahi tacos, price aside, some of the best fish tacos I've had in a long time. Fresh Mahi, hand made tortilla's, pickled red onions, thinly sliced chili peppers, three little gems on a plate. Sumptuous! I asked for " something " spicy and my server brought a very unusual side of a thick spicy blended sauce that fulfilled the craving for heat.   I can't believe the size of the patio they added and can't wait for cooler weather to enjoy it at happy hour. Great addition to the Arcadia restaurant scene. Congrats to all the Johnsons on this endeavor.

I've been to other Ling and Louie's and I was confused by the Biltmore L&L. The menu had vestiges of the former restaurants menu, fish tacos, guacamole, hamburgers. I came for the Asian food. Eatmate ordered the fish tacos and I ordered a noodle dish with shrimp. Disappointment arrived quickly in the form of the portion size. A very small bowl and only half full, flavorful, but the mood was set .  Server, to his credit, reported my remarks to his manager who offered a new dish. I came for noodles so that was that. Fish tacos....they were OK according to eatmate, just not great.  I appreciated the attentive service, although the wait staff was too aggressive, coming by every 5 minutes asking to remove my plates. Banana egg roll. Well that gets 4 stars. Will I be back to this L & L? Too many good choices at the Biltmore to give it a second try. Scottsdale L&L I love. What happened here???

Fifth time here, so I am really getting to know the menu and I usually insist on sampling from my guest plates. Chips and salsa free, but I also automatically order the guacamole which is chunky and rustic. My new favorite is Paella and at $8.00  a perfect meal The Al Pastor tacos get 6 stars, the best in town. A strong recommendation; The Inca salad with Quinoa as the main ingredient is a must order item and great for sharing. The space is beautiful as well, very clean and contemporary lines, uncluttered and a beautiful view of the kitchen where the magic happens.

I'm a fan of chef derived restaurants, so we have to start with 5 stars and go from there. We not only eat with our mouth but with our eyes and ears. The energy in this place at dinner is "high throttle" and that can be fun, but the noise level makes it difficult to have a conversation with dinner mates. Gumbo, collard greens, bread all satisfied my desire for southern food. Gumbo is outstanding, collard greens advertised "ham hocks" except we could barely find ham. All in all, Southern Rail is a must go to restaurant in Central Phoenix.
