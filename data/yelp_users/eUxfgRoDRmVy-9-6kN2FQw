Had the big nasty tonight, a biscuit topped wth fried chicken breast. Cheddar cheese and sausage gravy. Very good tasting and the service was supeb. The only flaw was the wilted salad which has the dressing mixed in which was the reason for only 4 stars. Next time i will order the dressing on the side.

Had to take advantage of the Leap Day special, any two entree's for $29, Nice touch for those who worked for free today. My friend ordered the Fried Shrimp and I ordered the Freidy Filet Steak which we shared as a surf n Turf. While I always order anything but steak here, that will change as this was as tender and tasty filet I have had in Phoenix rivaling my other favorite from Fleming's. Now for the good stuff, who would think to order Fried Shrimp from a casual Texas hole in the wall? I am glad Cathy did. These were a real surprise as she was served 5 huge, Texas size, maybe U15 or 1/3 pound of definitely Gulf shrimp which were beer battered and cooked to perfection. This was a meal to savoir and opened my eyes past the chicken fried steak they are known for. My dilemma now is what to order next time or should I order the Fried Chicken I have not tried. I recommend TEXAZ GRILL! Past Post* Stopped in for the liver , bacon and onion special and it was great. 3 slices of liver smothered in caramelized onions with 3 strips of thick bacon and a pile of fresh mashed potatoes topped with white gravy. I ordered my salad dressing on the side which left the lettuce crisp, Very good meal which has me giving that elusive 5 star on this visit.

I was excited to try for the Friday Night Fish Fry after watching the yelp reviews. Pulled up at 6:30 and a line so it must be the real deal.  Gave my name to the hostess and told maybe a 15 minute wait which was perfect as my son and his friend would not arrive till then. 45 minutes passed and I checked with the hostess as I am noticing a few groups being seated who arrived after me. This time the hostess was not the young girl who took my reservation but an older lady who advised me I had a long wait as I was last on the list and at least 6 groups ahead of me. Some how they must have made a mixup but I would not mind the wait as it must be good. Finally 8:10 pm we are seated and quickly served water and menus. I asked about the fish and was told it was all you can eat Fresh Alaskan Pollack, Cole Slaw and French Fries for $9.95. Alaskan Pollack is not too bad white fish, similar to cod where it's namesake Atlantic Pollack is not the same species and is somewhat a slim white fish with color close to the skin and an off flavor, mostly ground and used in fish sticks and imitation crab. While the fish was cooked nicely and the french fries crisp, the fish was not Alaskan Pollock and had the off taste of its namesake from the Atlantic. Service was scatter brained from the hostess mixup to the server who had the memory of a gnat and took us the last 15 minutes to get our check. Just by the sheer number of guests I think I just hit them on a bad night and maybe their fish provider made a mistake this week. I will head back to the Peoria Cafe for my fish next Friday as it is always good but I can't help myself to try new Friday night fish fry's over the Valley.

I usually have my Friday Night Fish at the Peoria Café but wanted to try another restaurant just for a change but am sorry I did.  The place was about  1/2 full of guests and I was one of three sitting at the counter only to have to wait 20 minutes for a server. Seemed like all of the servers were having a rough night as I failed to see anyone in the whole place smile, which includes the customers. My food arrived about 20 minutes after ordering and it looked great but one bite of the Cod told me I made a bad choice in changing restaurants. The breading they used tasted like uncooked flour and real chalky, I can't seem to get that taste out of my mouth. The fish itself was nice but the coating was horrible. I hope it was just a bad night but the server expressed regrets for being stuck on the Friday night schedule and her enthusiasm seemed the same as all the ladies working. Come to think of it I have my own regrets for being there, Next week I will be back to the Peoria Café!

Not much to look at outside in a grim strip mall but surprisingly the inside is clean and has a nice charm. Server was very attentive and food was served hot and quick. I had the chorizo and eggs which was maybe a little salty but the spices were spot on. The beans were as good as I have had, the rice was fresh and the grilled jalapeno along with the avocado slices were the perfect garnish. I can't wait to try more of the menu as all dishes I saw looked great! Don't let the outside scare you as the inside and food is the real deal and worth the visit.

I tried the giant carumba and it is a huge b3ef burrito enchilada style. The beef is watery and lacks flavor but sure looks good. On previous visits they usually gibve a smsll bowl of chips for the wait but maybe they have cut back. The service was not friendly but fairly quick. Hope it was just a bsd day for them and not a new trend. Bring back some flavor and ease up on the salt

Nice place with great service but the food is just so so, nothing special. Not bad but not good either, just ok. I think I will not return as there are better in the area.

My Friday Night Fish Fry to go place. The fish is beer battered and cooked right with huge servings. I opt for the fries which were nice and crisp bt a touch of salt after frying would bring out some flavor. The cole slaw lacks any flavor and is cabbage swimming in tasteless mayo, not very appetizing but the fish is the star and keeps me coming back almost every Friday. As busy as this place is the teamwork of the servers makes everyone feel at home and are very efficient. I highly recommend the Friday Night Fish Fry, just pass on the Cole Slaw.

In a small run down strip mall and somewhat cluttered inside. Looking at the awkward menu board I saw Mexican Food, Chicago Style Hot Dogs and Philly Beef sandwiches, wasn't sure if I should run or just suck it up and try something. I ordered the Philly Beef Sandwich with onions, peppers and mushrooms. When it arrived it was a generous portion on a toasted Bolillo Roll but the first bite was a wow! Nice flavor and even the toasted roll worked. I might have to go back for this sandwich and might even try some of the rest of the menu.

Ordered the 8.99 lunch special tomato soup and blt. What a mess when it arrived, made using 1 slice of stale bread cut uneven to somewhat resemble a 1/2 sandwich. Bread was crushed with no mayo, 2skimpy slices of bacon 1/2 thin slice of tomato and a shed of lettuce. Horrible execution by the cook and never saw our server again to get mayo or refills of drinks. This location has ruined me at going to Applebee's ever again. See picture of ptesentation.

What a disater and a wasre of 1 hour. Ordered the fried cod spicy and 3 shrimp with a side of fried okra. Ten minutes after I ordered I added 1 pork rib which was $3.00, wow. Ten minutes later my rib arrived without my fish. The rib was 1/2 cold and 1/2 hot, definately microwaved. The rib wss tough as leather and dificult to get off the bone. Another 10 minutes passed and I asked about the fish. They finally located it and in 10 minutes it arrived. The small filets were only partially breaded and were mushy. Rather than the fresh fis I expected, they brought back my childhood nightmares of frozen fish sticks. The shrimp were boxed frozen and tastless. The saving grace was the fried okra was ok and the elderly order taker did offer a free desert for the long wait. I declined as I just wanted out of there.

Freshest Pork in Phoenix, hands down. Great people to work with who will make the cuts you need. The Pork is good, not like you get in Iowa but is the best in the Valley of the Sun.

I have been using Thomas for about 4 years and wonder why I did not leave a review. Thomas uses a Rotovac cleaning system which does a wonderful job keeping my carpets clean and smelling fresh. Thomas has always been on time and does exceptional work at a very reasonable price. I had guests spill red wine on my fabric sofa and carpet which he made disappear to never come back. The most Awesome carpet cleaner I have ever used and I highly recommend Thomas and Awesome Carpet Cleaning.

Rough place to say the lestt. The smell at the door was enough to turn me awsy plus I don't fit the banger like profile. Everyone needs their local bar, this is just not mine.

Small restaurant tucked in a strip mall. Very clean and cherelrful lady who is server. Cook. And dishwasher. I ventured for the jerk chickken and it was great. The chicken had marinated in a fantastic jerk sauce and cooked to moist perfection. It was served over fluffy rice with red beans, some grilled peppers, onions and cabbage. The fried plantains were the perfect compliment to this home cooled meal. I highly recommend you try this place. I will be back soon.

Stopped in on their opening day where they had a limited menu and brisket was still to be had at 1 pm. I had the brisket, a pork rib and the only side available, Jalapeno cheese grits. The brisket was superb and melted in my mouth and the pork rib was just what I wanted, a well seasoned and perfectly moist and cooked rib. I liked everything I tried but while the grits tasted great, they were mushy being the reason for only 4 stars. It was opening day and I changed, giving them 5 stars on the brisket and ribs plus their service is superb, I can't hold the grits against them as the tasted great but slightly off on texture this day. I have tried their grits at the Farmers market and know it was just an off day with their quiet grand opening.  I love this place and know they will get all 5 stars from me on my future visits but I had to be honest on opening night. I highly recommend Little Miss Bbq and can't wait to try their other sides as well as the beef short ribs. Most that follow me on Yelp know I tell the truth and don't sugar coat my reviews, This place is legit and screams great Texas BBQ. Let me know your thoughts on your visit.

Ok, they have been open 1 month and I have been back 4 times! The Brisket is always the star but they also now have the Jalapeno Cheese Grits dialed in to a nice creamy texture with  fantastic flavor. The Pork ribs don't need sauce which is the way I like them. The house made sausage changes a bit but all I have tried were great. Little Miss BBQ has the best Brisket in the Valley! Keep up the good work.

Wow, called 3 times to have them repair a chain link fence, finally get a call back and the repair guy says he can get a truck to me tomorrow and the cost is $500. I asked him if he wanted to look at the repair needed first and he said it would be $500 for a truck to show up, Do you want it or not? Probably the worst customer service I have ever encountered. As much as I do not leave poor reviews this is the exception, I would not use a company like this and hope others will beware.

Nice find in the area. Taco Bar with so many options it made my head spin but the chicken hit the spot. 2 hot chicken and 1 mild. Perfect. Ordered the Nacho's  which was no more than chips with cold cheese, beans and a meat of my choice. very disappointing with the super tacos. I will be back and want to try the burritos but be assured the Nachos will not be on the menu.

Very pleasant lunch in a super clean in the chrerful environmrnt of the Peoria City Hall. Greeted with many smiles and suggestions for my lunch. I tried the banh mi (I am not sure of spelling),  sandwich with chicken and it was great. The chewey bread filled with chicken,  pickled carrot, daikon and cilantro with a sauce worked well together. I will go back to try more of their menu at this hidden gem. Try it ss you will too be a fan

Who would have thought a potato could be so tasty. The ladies taking my order were very sweet and guided me to the brisket which filled the plate. The bbq sauce, cheese were great. The sweet potato pie was worth the trip alone. When I am back in the area I will definately stop in.

This place has no clue, direction or food skills. The ambience is missing and the staff does not seem to care. I started with a Corona and Hot Chicken wings. I was served a Heinekin and bloody frozen chicken wings. I see no reason to come back till their liquidation auction. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else that cares.

Found the place on Yelp while looking for a place close by that I could grab a bite to eat and watch a D-Back game. A stand alone building in a Shopping Mall that was a pleasant surprise upon entering. Hometown bar feel that was clean, a couple pool tables, tons of TV's, off track sports betting and a huge bar. I was surprised it not being very busy being a Saturday evening but it made it easy to pick a seat at the bar in front of the game. 3 bartenders, bar back and 2 servers seen but none seemed to want to acknowledge me. The bartender who seemed to have my section was pretty intensely involve with a texting session and the other passed without ever looking my way. There were approx 4 people in my section when one guy near yelled Leanne and got the texting ladies attention. She slowly walked his way without missing a text. She gave him a beer and did ask what I would like to drink. I ordered a Corona and a menu if they are still serving. I looked at the menu and was surprised at the variety. It took 15 minutes to get the Texting Goddess' attention to place an order for the Crafty Veteran Burger with french fries. About 10 minutes later I noticed 4 baskets of food show up in the kitchen window, one was definitely a burger and I waited in anticipation. after 10 minutes of waiting I finally caught the Texting Princess's eye and pointed to the food in the pass. She ambled over and looked at the food and went back to her phone then yelled across the room, "It's not yours, Yours is not ready yet." Another 10 minutes passed when I noticed a male bartender look at the 4 baskets of food and begin to carry them out to customers. To my surprise the burger that sat in the pass for close to 20 minutes was mine. The bartender asked me if I wanted a fresh burger after I explained the Texting Goddess actions but the game was almost over and I was hungry. The burger was good, nice Brioche Bun, fresh veges, good thick beef. The fries would have been crispier fresh but were ok anyway. The condiments come in a basket but the mustard spout was so caked with dried crust nothing would come out, maybe a good thing for health reasons. Overall I would have given a 4 star review except for the horrible service from Leanna and the lack of interest of all the servers and bartenders except the one who brought my order. He was a shorter hispanic guy with shaved head, sorry I did not get his name, but he added a star to my review. The food and having sports might make me try again but my guess is Management is absent here as most of the servers and bartenders just did not smile nor care about customer service.

Wow, call the police, I have been robbed! Plunked down $17 for the tiniest lobster roll ever seen. To top that off the lobster was tasteless, water loaded and mushy with a stripe. Of mayo. The only reason for two stars was the cute little 4 inch bun was tasty.  Save your money and stick to the $4 tater tots if you must eat here.

The sonoran dog was ok, not the best I have had. The beans were missing  and loads of mustard overtook all the flavors. Will try again in hopes this was an off day. 2nd visit the Sonoran Dog was a little better but still lacking flavor. Good thing for the salsa bar. Also tried their Caramelo with Carne Asada which lacked any spice at all, again thanks for the salsa Bar. I might try again if in the area but not as a destination.

Large open kitchen with a grill behind glass in the front. Seemed to be family owned with the entire family working. I ordered the Cheesesteak sandwich with homemade chips. The order took about 15 minutes to arrive, looked awesome and tasted great with my only complaint the way it was cut. Seems the cook was trying a biased cut but did it in a way that left one 1/2 missing 2 inches of top bun and the other missing 2 inches of the bottom bun. Truly a mess to eat and confusing at best. All in all the chips and sandwich were good and on my next visit will ask for a straight cut or try one of their burgers as they looked great also.

What a gem for breakfast! Tried the corned beef hash and eggs which came with cubed potatoes with bell pepper. Also a biscuit and sausage gravy. All in all the service was good and the food above average. I will be back to try more.

Sadly, today I have to take back 3 stars from my other visits. I ordered a blt sandwich with french onion soup. The blt was broken over cooked bacon bits, the thinest sliced tomato and a leaf of lettuce. How can one screw up a blt is beyond me. Now to the soup that arrived 10 minutes after my sandwich and uneatable. It was like someone took beef base added some onions then filled the cup with salad croutons. I am guessing they microwaved it allowing the croutons to disintegrate like mush. My server was pleasant but the kitchen staff were yelling and seemed a lot of horse play going on, must not have had a manager on duty. Now to top this visit off the large cook, I think I heard his name Steven yelled a few times, with dirty uniform walks to a few tables to shake hands and talk with guests only to go back to touching food in the kitchen without washing his hands. While I have been here 4 other times without problem and even giving them a Yelp of 5 stars, This visit made me take back 3 stars and it will be hard to come back anytime soon.  previous post! What a gem for breakfast! Tried the corned beef hash and eggs which came with cubed potatoes with bell pepper. Also a biscuit and sausage gravy. All in all the service was good and the food above average. I will be back to try more.
