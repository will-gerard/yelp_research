I hadn't been here in 10 years and was pleased to see it was still a great place to eat dinner. There are a lot of options on the menu, no matter what you're in the mood for. The eggplant sandwich caught my eye, and I was glad to have ordered it! The crispy eggplant with the jalape√±o jelly was delicious and unique. The fries that came on the side were hot and crispy. I also ordered a red sangria and it was one of the best sangrias I've had; it was a little drier than most, which I liked. I'll be coming back to try more items on the menu!

Sadly, I don't think I will be coming to this place anymore. I loved the concept of the all you can eat option, and the sushi itself is pretty good, but the terrible service and iffy sanitary status really kills it. I've been here a few times, and it was fine, but the last trip was not a great experience. I do want to say that the busser was very friendly and helpful, so shoutout to him. However, our waiter was pushy (we felt pressured to put in our order before we were ready) and rude. Everything was extremely slow, from getting our drinks, to actually getting our order right, to receiving our rolls. There was a steady stream of customers, but nothing to warrant the 2 hours and 15 minutes we spent in there.  And just to top it off, one of our water glasses had a suspicious slimy gunk on it, the bathrooms are gross, and someone in our party noticed the waiter putting his hand in someone's wine to fish something out of it, rather than pouring a new glass.  I think it's time to find a new sushi place!

This was my first visit, and I was really happy with the care they gave to my dog! The staff was friendly and really cared about making my dog feel at ease; she gets really nervous at vet visits and they were very understanding and kind (and provided treats, which she loved!). I had brought my dog in for a routine checkup and the whole process was very easy; it was quick and efficient but they were thorough and took time to ask questions. We got everything done in about 40 minutes, including shots. I'll definitely be coming back for our yearly checkup, and if anything comes up before then!

Absolutely terrible service. I stood at the counter waiting to order for almost 10 minutes while the employees said "just a second" and then proceeded to ignore me. I understand if you are short-staffed, but a little communication goes a long way. They had a really inefficient system with the employee taking orders and then making the whole order before moving to the next person in line. There was another employee working, too, so I'm not sure what he was doing; mostly he seemed to just be standing around watching. I felt bad for the one worker doing everything.

The food is some of my favorite in Arizona. It's my go-to place, because most everything is delicious (the one thing I'm disappointed with is the guacamole, which is really bland...I can make it better myself, and that's definitely not the case of anything else on the menu) and it's really reasonably priced. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because sometimes the service is really slow, to the point that my food has been cold when I have picked it up after calling in an order. I get that they are busy, and I wouldn't mind waiting, but when my food is sitting there ready and I'm standing there wanting to pay but not being helped, it can be frustrating.

Good service, lots of options. I have always been happy with my food here. Really like the veggie hashbrown skillet. The food is a little expensive for what it is; you can probably find comparable food at a cheaper price, but the restaurant is clean and comfortable, so, worth it.

Came here before an ASU football game...it was not completely packed like the other places around, so we were seated right away, which was awesome. Great happy hour specials, including half off appetizers and very reasonably priced beer on tap.   I loved the baked chicken wings with the sweet Thai chili sauce, and there are tons of beers to choose from! Mirror Pond Pale Ale is a fave of mine, so I was excited to see it on the list.   A great option for game days!

Great all around! Excellent service, as well as lots of delicious drinks and foods to choose from. Went for brunch at 12pm on a Sunday and there was no wait; we were seated right away and our waiter was very attentive. Will definitely be coming back.

Good selection, great prices! I love that the smaller plate sizes let you choose a bunch of different options so you can really try everything that looks good without worrying about spending too much.

Always worth the wait. Few places are good enough for a 45 minute to an hour wait, but Snooze is! I have loved every item I've tried. The staff at this location is always friendly and attentive. Get a pancake to share before your main course; it's like a reverse dessert!

The food and drinks here are seriously amazing. We had some dumplings and the chicken and waffle steamed buns to start. I am now obsessed with those buns. Genius idea. The chicken ramen was also delicious and just what I was craving. The drinks are STRONG; seriously, they are pricey, but you will get your money's worth! I had the Mai Tai and loved it. I can't wait to come back and try the others. Just a really fun place--cool atmosphere, friendly service, and unique dishes.

Honestly not sure what all the terrible reviews are talking about. I've always had good food and generous pours of beer. The servers are friendly, too. The only negative I've experienced is that the wait to be seated and to get food/drink refills can be ridiculously long, even when they are seemingly not that busy. This is definitely not somewhere you should come if you're in a hurry.

I wish I could comment on everyone's reviews who say this place is just like Jimmy John's to tell them they're crazy. These subs are unique (the cranberry wasabi sauce is delicious!) and the bread is soft and delicious. I literally came here because I didn't want to go to Jimmy John's and I got what I wanted! Can't wait to come back and try something new!

Not sure what the negative reviews are talking about. Every time I've come to Fractured Prune, the staff has been friendly and the doughnuts were delicious! They are good any time, but eating them fresh, when they're still hot and gooey, takes it to another level! My favorite is the Carnival--a simple classic.

Yay! So happy to see Mad Greens has made its way to Arizona. I became a fan when I lived in Boulder.   Love the salads, of course (the regular size is more than enough food, only go for the bigger one if you are REALLY hungry!) and the hummus was a nice surprise. The one hummus that I wasn't a huge fan of was the beet; it didn't have a lot of flavor, which was disappointing.   The only downside is that it is a little pricey, which makes it more of a "once in awhile" place.

Stopped by this new location for the first time today, and was pleased with the service! I used the drive through, and got my drink quickly. The cashier was very friendly and we had a nice conversation about my dog, who was in the car with me. I'm not often near this Starbucks, but I will definitely stop in again the next time I have a chance.
