These guys are awesome! Super educated on product! They are eager to help and when I was leaving... they actual said, "thanks for coming in, we appreciate your business".   Wow! How many businesses will say that to a customer!  Their inventory might not be as large in all product categories but they are happy to order what you need.  However, when it comes to Rock climbing gear... NO ONE will have a larger selection... it's awesome!   I can't say enough about the quality of the staff... The best!

OK... lets start with the obvious... they aren't cheap.  But if you have high quality clothes... they are the only place in town to take them.  I have over 20 dress shirts, each over $250 and there's no way I'd take them to a discount cleaners.  They also do a great job getting stains out.  If I'm going to spend $2500 on a suit, I've got no problem spending a little more to make sure it gets cleaned properly.

Had dinner and drinks at the bar last night... the female bartender never smiled once... she looked pissed every time we asked for another drink or a water refill.  Never asked if we needed anything, how was our meal etc.  Back in 2007 - 2010... they had truly professional bartenders.  They knew your name, they'd anticipate your needs etc.  They've moved down market with the current staff... last nights bartender belongs at Zipps.

Let's cover what's good...  Believe it or not, their food is very good for a sports bar. You wouldn't think it would be but it is. In addition, lots of TVs so every seat and table has a good view of several different games playing.  But as everyone knows, it's how they run the restaurant that makes it or breaks it.  This is where they fall down. I came in for Monday Night Football and they ran the Suns game through the central speakers instead if the game.    Asked the manager how come... His answer, "because that was what was first requested".  So I asked, "whoever comes in first, sits down gets to decide what gets pumped through the speakers"? He said yes.  Unbelievable! I sure hope nobody comes in early on Sunday and requests figure skating.  90% of everyone at Zipps was there for Monday Night Football but, instead, we listened to the Suns game.  Management needs to be changed!  I'm heading across the street to Hazzelwoods next week... I bet they'll know what to play on Monday Night!

I've been back several times since my first review... my girlfriend loves their sushi. And I agree, their sushi is really good. They have a sushi chef that makes his own special "off menu" items and they are delicious!  But again, the staff is spending more time chatting in the corner than waiting on the client. We have to request food, drinks and water refills half the time!   Most of the staff appears to be more focused on "catching up" with each other and not with the customer.

I own several rental properties in the Valley and have used Details Remodeling for several small repairs.  My tenants said he showed up on time, took great care in keeping the area clean while he worked and was very professional.    All together, Kent did drywall repair, small plumbing projects, small electrical repairs, one roof repair and installed some shelving in a closet. All the work was perfect.  So then I tried Details Remodeling for a bathroom remodel.  Kent took care of the  entire project. Ripped out the old bathroom, put in new, tile, baseboards, new vanity, toilet, sink, re-routed the plumbing, moved the bathroom door over 12 inches... He did it all and it turned out amazing.  I was tired of handyman services that when the guys show up you're like... I totally get why you're a handyman, cuz you couldn't possible get a job doing anything else.  Not the case with Kent and his company.  He delivers what he promises, comes in at what he said it would cost and he's great to work with.
