Went here after a wedding with about 27 guests and they for sure have the "we don't really care if you like us or not" vibe. The theme was pretty neat but it was so dark you had to use a flashlight to see the menu which they do have attached but only about 25% of them work so make sure your phone is charged. We came during happy hour and they told all of us it did not apply to us because we were too big of a party. Needless to say, I think 2 people ordered a $8 beer but they could have made much more money off us if they allowed the happy hour for the last 30 minutes there was left to encourage more drinking during the meal. Food was super overpriced for what you get. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good but I can make a pasta meal at home that's just as good for $20 for 5 people as opposed to $20-$30/plate. They don't split checks, so come with cash and if you want to split a meal with someone expect to pay $6 more.

I am on this recent mission to find the best place near me to get fresh and delicious coffee and I really enjoyed the place. I ordered a cappuccino and it was very good and did not require any added sweetener. The barista even asked me my preference (heavy or light) which I appreciated because I always forget to mention that I like a lot of foam. I also ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with pasta salad and it was good. The bread was nice and crispy and they used good cheese. It was a comfortable place to spend some time.

The perfect spot for a weekend breakfast. Small and cute with plenty of delicious options. My husband got the berry crepes which were light and fresh and I got the lox open sandwich. Iced coffee had a cinnamon hint and I didn't need any sweetener. Potatoes had nice seasoning and cooked perfectly. Ordered a side of bacon to split and half was the way my husband likes, floppy and the other half had a crisp like I like. It's like they knew! Nice, friendly staff. Only open on Saturday and Sunday during the summer.

I'm about 98% sure I was given hot coffee over ice when I ordered a cold brew due to the fact that the color of my black coffee was light brown and slightly cloudy and others there who had the cold brew had dark and looked like cold brew normally looks. If you run out, tell someone so they can change their order. Hot coffee over ice is gross...

Ventured here for some Sunday brunch. While a little busy, still found a place to sit easily. I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo and my husband had the grilled cheese with bacon. The burritos eggs were nice and fluffy, chorizo cooked perfectly and potatoes were good. Even came with a side of house made salsa verde with avocado in it, really tasty, and a side of seasonal fruit. The best part is their bottomless drink section which included my favorite iced coffee. Had alcohol and espresso drinks as well. Cute shaded patio areas all throughout. Not dog friendly patio due to health code according to a sign I read. Staff was friendly and laid back vibe with bob Marley playing softly in the background.

Went here last night for dinner. For appetizers I got the veggie rolls and they were delicious and perfectly crispy and my husband got the hot and sour soup which was probably the best hot and sour soup we've ever had, it was full of chicken and the broth was extremely flavorful. For our dinners my husband got the Hawaiian fried rice and it was very good and big portion, he ordered it hot and it was the perfect spicy for him. I ordered the yellow curry and it was very good. I can't wait to eat leftovers today.   I hope more people realize this place is open because it was pretty empty. The service was great, the menu prices were a little confusing as it looks like they got their menus printed without prices on it and so they had to manually write it in with marker but messed up on a few.
