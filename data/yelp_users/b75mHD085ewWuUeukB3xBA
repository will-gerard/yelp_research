I had a great first time experience with this location. I brought my new 16mo old dog in to be spayed. The hours worked great with my work schedule (drop off at 6:30am and pick up by 5:30pm). I was the third person there and the whole check in/drop of process took maybe 20 min top. They had me fill out a patient form and then my dog and I were taken back to a vet tech who did vital checks. After the vet came over, did a quick examination and said we were ready for surgery. You can't beat the cost. My total bill was $111 ($71 for surgery, $15 for pain meds, $10 for an e-collar and an extra $15 charge because it appeared my dog was coming into heat). The best part of it l was the recovery. They incision and stitches were nicely done and my dog did not appear to be in pain. They even called 48-72 hours after the surgery to check and see how everything was going with the healing process. I highly recommend this clinic and will be returning to update vaccinations for both of my dogs.

Professional, knowledgeable and friendly! I love this place and every time I go in they know exactly what I need and even ask about my dogs and how they are doing with their Flyball training. I will always shop here over any other pet supply store.

I loved the location of this place and the layout of the apartment. But unfortunately that's about it. There is a huge bug problem. My roommate and I are clean people and had the apartment treated by the big guy numerous times, but that did not stop the invasion of little roaches. It was disgusting. Turning on the light in the kitchen at night or in the morning and seeing the roaches scatter in every direction was horrible. During the last month of our lease I couldn't take it any more and ate all of my meals at my boyfriends or at a restaurant. They provide an exterminator service but if your neighbors don't do it also, than its pointless. Only had 1 scorpion (that we saw) but that was 1 too many for me!

Park looks big enough with shade and benches, but it would have been nice to know the dog park is closed on Thursdays before driving all the way out here.

I love this place and whenever I have visitors in town, this is where I take them! In fact, I've had a visitor go to Cornish twice during their 4 day trip in Arizona!  My favorite pasty is The Pilgrim. It is so good that it has really prevented me from trying a different kind of the numerous pasties on the menu.

Their pizza and beer cheese dip for the pretzel appetizers are to die for! I also love coming here for reverse happy hour and for their great beer selection.
