I'm a regular customer here.   I'm very disappointed with all the new staff they have working.   I ordered three Carmel fraps.   Workers made my drink taste like a ice Frap.  Then the worst part was them not even wiping my cup down with the left over spill that they put on the cups.   I had to take a napkin and wipe it myself and got coffee on my work shirt. I am furious!

Probably the worst Olive Garden I have been to.   After being seated it took the waitress 15mins to even greet us and take our drink order.   Next after unrolling my utensils I noticed that the forks and knives were not washed well. There was left over residue.. Disgusting I must say.   The food was cold and did not meet expectations.

I ordered a #2 pork roll sandwich.   I nearly chipped/broke my tooth biting into it.  Sandwich was hard as a rock.   Very disappointing compared to California's lee sandwiches.

Love this place. I love their milk tea w/boba.  I usually am here at least once a day.   The staff are extremely friendly.  Great place to take your family to.  They also have a ton of tvs to watch any sports games that are on.

Amazing and amazing.   Everything is good here so you won't be disappointed with whatever you decide to get.  It's a must to try the brick toast if you haven't

Love this place.  The Staff are extremely friendly and food is phenomenal.  I like going here at least once a week.  I love how you can add as many toppings as you want on the pizza

Absolutely love this place.   I love how you can add as much toppings as you want on the pizza.   I love putting the garlic herb butter on the whole pizza/edges.    The staff are extremely friendly and cool

Nice environment,but the food wasn't that great. Paid $6.00 for a burger (not including drinks or fries).  Very bland I must say. The if this is your first time I highly suggest to get a chicken sandwich in stead otherwise you'll be disappointed.
