We ordered delivery for two pizzas and an asiago cheese bread. The pizzas were fine but the cheese bread was totally burnt. I can't believe they delivered it to us. This was 8pm on a Friday, so it should've been prime pizza time.  Would not order from again.

TL;DR: I overpaid for a 2014 Hyundai Accent  and then got stuck dealing in repair center hell.  I went into Hyundai Autonation Tempe Arizona ready to buy my first car with financing ready to go. I left abused, dead tired, and with my soul to the devil. This car buying process took a total of eight hours. To break down the time, it was 15 minutes of trying to explain that i wanted the most basic 2014 Hyundai Accent. A 10 minute test drive where I assured the salesperson that is what I wanted. Then came 6 hours and 45 minutes of scare tactics. I waited for our care salesman to get back to us (while he stood there talking to his coworkers), trying to tack on extra services and fees (For the last time I don't want window tinting), and endured literal hours of boredom as I sat there for hours trying to sign the paperwork. I had been working with our sales rep but was then brought in front of the general manager for a scene out of scare tactic school. Remember, I brought my own financing, walked-in knowing the car I wanted, and had called ahead. I finally drove away paying over MSRP for the most base model car, without a spare tire, and with my crappy warranty that does nothing. I really hoped I would never have to return.  Then the A/C problems came. I really hated my buying experience and did not want to go back to Hyundai Autonation Tempe. I hoped it was a simple A/C recharge, so I went to our local Goodyear. They recharged the A/C but it went out again. Goodyear told us their was probably a leak in the line, most likely in the dashboard. Goodyear asked us to go to the Dealership and use our 60,000 bumper-to-bumper warranty that Autonation had sold me on. I thought I was safe, but Autonation proved once again how much they want to gouge their customers.  I walked into the Hyundai Autonation after scheduling an appointment. It only took five phone calls after they kept hanging up on me. I tried to explain my situation over the phone as clearly as I could. The representative, Nick Palmer, did not take notes and did not seem to care that my A/C was out. This is Arizona. In July. I brought the car in and tried to re-explain the issue. Nick Palmer explained that the issue was probably a recharge. I explained that it had been recharged multiple times to no avail. He assured me he would get the problem fixed. I asked Nick Palmer to please tell me if there were going to be charges so that I could approve them. After seeing the bad reviews I had wanted to stay at Hyundai Autonation Tempe to keep an eye on the car. I asked if Autonation had wifi, the day before I went in. The unhelpful customer support rep said the wifi was solid and that I could hunker down during the weekday because I still had to work. I came in the next day and the wifi was not working at all. I spoke to the parts representative and she explained that the wifi had been down all week. I asked about a shuttle to go home to work. Autonation explained that they do have a shuttle but it only goes 5-10 miles. My home was out of that range. THANKS AUTONATION.  I was called the next day and explained that the issue had been resolved. I asked Nick Palmer, the fine representative of Hyundai Autonation, if the leak had been found. Mr. Palmer told me there were no leaks and because the issue had been resolved he would charge me $170. I explained that the A/C had been recharged twice and sent the receipts and statement of work over from Goodyear. Autonation Hyundai Tempe did not care at all. I asked to speak to manager. It only took twenty minutes on hold to speak to the manager, Brand Reed. Mr. Reed assured me that if the recharge did not work I would be refunded. To explain my frustration, I have no problem with technician's doing work that is needed to test the system, I half expected to get charged for another recharge. My issue with this recharge is that I was not called or asked for approval, which Nick said he would do.  Finally I convinced the manager to hold on to the car for another day to see if the leak happened again. For clarity the A/C had been going out approximately four days on both of the previous recharges. Autonation agreed to hold it for two more days, where they claimed the car had been run for hours and still blew cool. I had cooled off, without a car or A/C, by this point and went to go get the car. Nick promised that if the A/C went out again I would be refunded.  This brings me to do today where I called Nick and Hyundai Autonation Tempe to explain that the A/C had gone out again. I immediately asked for a refund so that I wouldn't have to float $170 for a problem that had not been solved. Nick told me that I would be refunded when, "all repair work had been resolved." I was never told about the stipulations of the refund and that I would be stuck in Autonation Tempe Hell for the rest of eternity.

A classic diner joint. I love this place. Their omelettes are phenomenal. I can't give it a full 5 stars because there wait is atrocious, the hours are weird (9-2 every day), the bathrooms are literally a sauna with no air conditioning. If you want something greasy with eggs and coffee. This is your place.

Really great lunch menu. Portions were reasonable and even able to take some home. Our server (Kalee!) was nice, quick service, and made us feel comfortable. Packed up our to-go food and gave us bread and a to-go drink. Really good! Food was tasty. I got the Big Rig and it was tasty and not too spicy (I really like spice so try at your own risk). My partner got the Big Hot Parm sandwich and it was tasty as well. The only thing I want is for them to bring back the cream soda!

I went on a Sunday afternoon. The food was below expectations as compared to the other Chinese food in the area. For some reason the heating trays were set to high and I burned my hand on the steam rising between the entree platters. The selection is poor, bland, and did not seem to be changed out after getting old. The basics (orange chicken, beef and broccoli) were okay. Sushi bar looked weird. The interior is old and worn. Wait staff wore dirty clothes. Children were playing in the dining area and seemed to be the employees children.

I used to really like this place. It used to be really really really spicy which was the big draw. Now it's just a kind of awful mexican food place where everything is bland. The one in ahwatukee still has some spice. Please make this restaurant more like the other Los Dos Molinos.

I've been here quite a few times and it's the cleanest Chinese buffet in the area. Food is of high quality especially the seafood. The only buffet sushi I feel safe eating. Lunch is reasonably priced and even though dinner is a little pricey it's worth it.  One time I found a hair in the ice cream so that was a bummer.

I got the garlic pork and my partner got the honey chicken to go. Pork was bland and had pieces of fat all over it. The honey chicken had some flavor to it but it wasn't great. We also got two sodas which were not mixed correctly. The portions (including soda) were big but I ate less than half my food and threw the rest away. The actual restaurant was bland and old looking. Table was sticky.

I really didn't enjoy these cupcakes even though I wanted to. I love Sprinkles and didn't expect them to be as good but we didn't even finish these. We got an Oreo and Strawberry Cheesecake cupcake. We came in right before they closed so maybe these cupcakes were old, I don't know.  The actual cake of Oreo cupcake cake was moist but bland. The sugar frosting was really, really sweet. Like you can feel the grit of the sugar granules in your mouth. The frosting kind of tasted like cream but the sugar taste was overwhelming.  The Strawberry Cheesecake cake was kind of dry and didn't really taste like strawberry. The graham cracker crust was really dry and flaky. It tasted like sand. The frosting was minty and didn't taste like cheesecake. Also still super sweet.   I would avoid this place and stick with Sprinkles.

TL;DR I got food poisoning and it was awful. I went around 1am on a Wednesday so I wasn't expecting much. I got the steak omelette with hashbrowns my girlfriend got the appetizer sampler platter, and our friend got an iced coffee and a bowl of fruit. I stopped eating the omelette halfway through because the eggs tasted gross and the hashbrowns were burnt. I ate a bit of the sample platter but the onion rings were doughy and the chickens was undercooked. The iced coffee was stale coffee with hazelnut poured in and not nice at all. Once we got home my stomach started cramping and my girlfriend threw up. Don't eat here. At least at night.
