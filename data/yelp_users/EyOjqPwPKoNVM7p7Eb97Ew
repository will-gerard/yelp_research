I love coming here for breakfast, it's conveniently located and Cipriano is always helpful. I usually get the PC eye opener and it's 2 eggs, potatoes, toast and coffee for only $3 you can't beat that! It's a great place to eat it take out and I've always been satisfied with the freshly make food and friendly customer service by owner. Get your own eye opener!

Yasda is a good spot for lunch. Ever since new management the place has friendlier staff and better food. I love to eat lunch here on Fridays because they have a $5 Teriyaki Chicken Bowl Special! That's a good deal for a nice portion lunch. Just today I decided to ask for easy brown rice and extra veggies and they were able to do that for me. Overall the food is good and for $5 you can't beat a great deal or lunch! Bon Appétit!

I recommend the Wonton Soup and Vietnamese Rolls, they never seem to disappoint. The peanut sauce and sweet chili that comes with rolls is my favorite part. Soup is a bit salty but edible. Bon Appétit y'all!

This place is not what it used to be. I went with the $16 car wash and I am not satisfied with the wait time or the service. After I pulled up to the full service canopy 2 car that were there after me got serviced first. The vacuuming and interior window cleaning was awful. To top it off the guys acted as if I were inconveniencing their day at the car wash.  Anyway, I think it's time to take my business elsewhere! Not a happy camper!

I've been coming to this location for quite sometime now and their service had been gradually decaying. Team members are unwilling to help, unknowledgeable and operate without a regard and sense of urgency to assist us the customers!  Just now left the store with yet another bad experience so I decided to don something about it. I will be calling GM Joe Davis to voice my concern.

The Hero Factory is one of my favorite spots downtown! I love the atmosphere that Nicole and her staff provide! You can have a chill conversation with Nicole while you wait for your food...she's the coolest owner you'll ever meet! The food is great and everything is made fresh when you order it. Subs are big enough for 2 people and very tasty and hearty! I recommend the western omelette for breakfast and the patriot for lunch!!! Amazing place!

This place never disappoints! The owners are super chill - Kalen & John, stop by and meet them. I love how friendly they are and they take the time to explain their menu options! The food is very tasty and freshly made.  The portions are very hearty...nom nom nom I recommend trying the daily special since they always knock it out of the ball park! I love the fact that they might extend their hours and talks about possible Sunday hours are in the air, now I'll enjoy their food more. Ok enough writing, my tacos await! Bon Appétit!

This is my favorite Starbucks of all in the downtown area! I usually go in the mornings and Lucy is always so welcoming and happy which makes your visit a pleasant one. One of the things I enjoy is the fact that I can get a trenta green tea in the morning for $3 and then go in the afternoon for a refill for only .80 cents!!!!  Yeah it's like the best deal while trying to keep cool in PHX! The line can be long at times but these ladies make it worth your time!!! Starbucks product without the commercialized feel to it...win!

This was my first time getting ink done at 2012 and I had a phenomenal experience! I was referred to Victor by one of my good friends who had work done by him...which I completely loved!  I walked in for the first time to get a feel for the place and everyone was uber friendly. I kept communicating with Victor via email to work on a design and went into shop to finalize it, then the day for my appointment came! I am so excited I found Victor! He's very professional, personable and amazing artist! Overall it took about 1.5 hours and they went by really fast. Place was really clean and I felt comfortable. I look forward to keep working with him, the attention he pays and dedicates to details will blow your mind! PLUS, his name is Victor! Such an awesome name!!! Haha Thanks Victor!

It was my first time here and we came to celebrate a friends birthday. The wait was lengthy even with reservations and they did not accommodate all of our party. The food took over an hour to be brought to our tables and it was cold, vapid and overly greasy. Not impressed by locale, staff and food. Will most definitely not come back. Oh and as we speak I've been waiting for a water refill now for 35 minutes! #fail

This is the second time I visit V's since they opened their downtown location.  The owner Rob is very pleasant and once you walk in his store he literally rolls the red carpet. Today Richie gave me a haircut and shave and as expected from V's the service was outstanding.  You can't beat the deal they have going on a cut and shave for $35 plus $2 beers and ESPN!!! This is the best man cave to kick at in downtown area! Stop by get a beer and ask Rob for Richie!
