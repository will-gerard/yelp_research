Been here 4 times and everytime I've enjoyed what I've had. Very local and fresh, kind of a hipster type of place. Local art on the wall, wait staff seems stoned, and the mango tea, is addictive. PESTO PIZZA add chicken is the BOMB!!! Do not come here with out ordering the cilantro/jalapeno hummus......orgasmic!!! I would pay big money for that receipe!!!

SERIOUSLY, the best happy hour prices I have ever seen. I've been here 3 times and my bill is always around $20. Always packed, food is perfect and always a cool vibe. Dont know about the regular menu during lunch or dinner, but Happy Hour RULES!!!!!

Liked it, I've hit a bunch of new places in Gilbert lately and Im on a streak. I had the omlette with green chilis and salsa in the middle.  99% of breakfast places, this wouldnt of been good, but the salsa was freeking perfect. Be preparred to wait, there's always a line. Worth it tho.

Only reason I came here is because I had a $100 gift certificate, I still spend another $100 on top of that. Your paying for the name.....there's better steak houses for the $$.

It's no RA, but it's local, small and personable. I've been there multiple times and it's been great everytime. Dragon roll is great, Nancy roll and the cute fruit dessert at the end. I keep it local, and I'll be back.

Loved my visit here. I was talked into the meatloaf for dinner. I have never ordered meatloaf at a restaurant, but tonight I did. The combination of meatloaf, and a bit of mashed potatoes and gravy on my fork......HEAVEN. I was sure to chew in every corner of my mouth....my taste buds were going crazy.......

You know the food is bad when your kids wont even eat it. Came in for lunch one day, food was horrible. The waitress took away 3 plates of food that were barely touched, you would think she would ask.......but maybe she already knew.  Come for the drinks, stay away from the food.

Scott Rich is one of the best. I have trusted him to finish my sleeves and have been blown away from his work. He has taken my business from my tattoo guy that I have had for over 5 years.  Clean studio, great work, and they always have movies playing to watch while you get your ink done.

Service......5 stars. I love a bartender that remembers what Im drinking.  Food.....REALLY good for bar food. Everything I've had has been delicious.  Decor.....Ehh.....dive bar? Kinda?  Clean place, good for me.  Kind of a sausage fest tho, I've been in here about 10 times and never any women. Oh well, Im never there more than an hour at a time anyway.   Live music on some weekend nights, no one really seems to pay attention to the band, too band, I've heard some really good groups here.   Local bar and will be back. Week after week.

Fall off the bone perfect flavored jerk chicken. Off the beaten path a bit, decor is nothing special, but the food is a 10!! The little jamaican ladies always come out and ask how the food is. So nice that they ask.  They do take their time getting your food out, but anyone that has been to the carribean knows....well thats just how it is. Always worth the wait. I'll be back time and time again!

Biker Dive bar, love it. Drinks we priced ok, service was quick. Live music the night I was there, so it was 4 stars for me. The bathrooms are a one person type of thing, but it was great. Lots of Bikers, but they dont bother anyone, so dont worry about them. I'll be back!!!

House of brews?? Ehh.....standard at best.  Just because you have 20+ taps, doesnt mean you need 10 of them to be Bud products. Food was good, sewer stench as we walked in at 5pm. I'll go one more time, but if I smell that again, I wont come back

Yeah, it was ok, pizza was tasty, so was the salad. I wasnt BLOWN out of the water about anything. So thats why I give it 3 stars. Great, attentive server (Suzanne) answered any questions I had, polite and friendly, because of her, I'll give an extra star.

Well, VERY pricey. Burgers not very impressive at all. Sweet potato fries were the highlite of the stop. Odd selection of soda's on the fountain too. I'll pass and wont be back.

First off, I try not to write bad reviews or say anything overly terrible about a local business, because I try to support them as much as I can.  BUT......  Come on guys, stop what your doing and save your business. Fire your ENTIRE staff and start over. I've been here 3 times, each time worse than before.  First stop.....New Years Eve....the only decent time I had here.  2nd......My girlfriend got here 30 min before I did. She was completly ignored at the bar THE WHOLE TIME!! The bartender was running around looking for a certain bottle of wine for some girl. When I got there she was so pissed, we left.   3rd......quick cocktail before we headed home for the night....I ordered a margarita, the bartender looked baffled like "holy crap, what the hell is in that?' Tequila and Roses lime juice is what I got. YOUR A BARTENDER FOR PETES SAKE!!! Its not some brand new drink I threw at you......dont they teach this in bartending 101? Or at least made this at some point in your life at your house?  In his defense, I did send it back and he filled up a tunbler of Don Julio for me, and I got 4 shots out of it.......good save sir, good save.  Finally, I have never seen any type of food on a table or anyone in the actual dining room. Put the live music in there, not right next to the bar!! I feel like Im being eye balled by the band the whole time Im sitting there.   Your in a legendary location. You have big shoes to fill. Read the reviews on here, and learn from it. The community WANTS to support you, but read what the customers are saying. Its all pretty much the same.  I wish you the best of luck.
