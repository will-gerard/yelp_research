I definitely would not recommend this place to anyone. The rolls were put together quite horribly, every time I tried to pick up a piece, it would fall apart before I could get it a few inches off the plate. Also, the fish was very mushy and honestly just felt like it was low quality. Ordered like 5-6 rolls and everything was like this, so it wasn't just one kind. To be honest, it was more expensive than RA but a much lower quality. Definitely recommend avoiding.

I must say, the coffee and atmosphere are definitely awesome. However, there is one staff member who is just downright unpleasant to work with; the man with the  weird ponytail (not the owner). On multiple occasions he has spoken with me and my group in a very condescending way. Once a large group of us had walked in to get drinks, and one guy in our party had a soft drink from the restaurant we had just ate at, and the weird ponytail employee immediately told him he has to get rid of it or get out, little did he know that the guy was going to finish his drink and order something in a few minutes, but the employee's rude attitude cost the business a sale. On another occasion, I was having a meeting and while waiting on everybody to arrive, the weird ponytail employee told us, very rudely, that in order to save a table, at least half the table's members must have drinks; I looked around and there was only one couple at a table, the other inside tables were all completely free. Maybe when they are packed that makes sense, but when we were waiting on people to arrive for less than 10 minutes and the shop was empty, there is no reason to be so rude about it.   I'm very disappointed that an outstanding coffee shop like Coffee Rush allows this employee to be as rude/annoying as he is. There are other reviews complaining about him as well, so I know that my case is not just isolated.

Went during lunch on a Sunday, there were three customers in the restaurant and I had to wait over ten minutes for a couple of chicken sandwiches because they had a "rush". They put the fries out and then had to wait for the sandwiches so the fries got cold. No apologies for the wait. Have to have them get you refills and restrooms open into the eating area.

Decided to come here to try some new food. I was not disappointed at all! The food was absolutely amazing, I highly recommend the chicken skin, beef tongue and the ramen. The sushi was also really good, but nothing too special. The atmosphere was really pleasing, it was very clean. Also, the service was amazing. Our waitress was very friendly and extremely helpful in helping us decide what to get. 10/10 experience!
