If you get service,  it's not good; it's more delivery service than customer service.   I'm in this airport weekly,  rarely stop in here unless with friends for a drink,  always filthy, tables piled with trash and they just keep moving from table to table.   Cleared my own table today,  but never got it wiped down while the staff just watched.

Horrible service, too much attitude and disgusting bathrooms!  Used to love coming here, will not go back again.

Yes, the Resturant is small but they just opened a new bar area that offers much more seating and they have some great speciality cocktails on the menu. The bar manager is great, very friendly and a great mixologist!   After some wonderfully prepared and great "bar-food" in Maximus a few days ago, we went back today for brunch  The cocktails we had the other night were great, only to find the best Bloody Mary in town this morning.  As recommended by our wonderful server, I had the steak scones whereas others in my party had the eggs Benedict and the Spanish Skillet, all of which were nothing short of magnificent! We love this little place and will surely continue to return over and over again!

Step out of your box and give something new a try, Short Leash is your opportunity to give a hot dog a chance. I experienced the Bear my first time at the truck, now I'm on a mission to try them all.  Fun, friendly service. Small, but fun atmosphere.

We love this place!  Great food and a fantastic team.    The meatloaf dinner and sandwich are great, and try the pot roast!    The best patio in downtown Phoenix.  If you haven't been here, definitely give it a try!

The bolognese on the ravoli,  amazing!   Lasagna of the day,  cooked to perfection.  Bottle of wine,  great food and our server, I wish there were more like her.  A definite must try.

Really slow service, even the hostess avoided welcoming us into the restaurant! If you crave just something simple, forget it  sometimes some basic nachos would be great, or a chicken quesadilla maybe, but not here. How about counting 5+ servers, only 6 tables and they all walk by and say nothing!  Service is nothing short of extremely horrible.  Oh then chops and salsa, nope!!  No tipping is the only positive thing, that's only because its to be earned!

Just gotta love this place!  Love the beer sampler.  You can try so many different types of beers I've never even heard of.  Now I have about a dozen new favorites.  Great time, every time!

Love Pomo!  Finally, great service downtown!  Pizza was perfect. There were four of us in our party. We started with a salad to share, good and plenty for a starter. We wanted to try two pizzas to share, our wonderful server suggested ordering one, then when about ready, she would bring the second.  Timing was perfect and both pizza's will make us all come back for more.   Then, the owner came out to the table with a light desert, on the house!  A few minutes later, he reappeared with a homemade Lemochello Cream...he was super nice, friendly and both of our treats were the perfect ending to a perfect dinner!  Thanks Pomo...we will be back!

Since opening, in the first location, we have ordered about 10 pairs of pants.   Not once have anything been delivered on time!  Yet,  loved our jeans once we received them... Usually about 8 months later.  Right now,  we are awaiting One pair of new jeans, one pair brought in for repair, and our friends who come in from California are waiting on several pairs of jeans.... And we are getting no return emails, calls.... Nothing!   Again, like always,  the the weeks to get the pants is now over 4 months!    We are now disputing credit card charges to get our money back from these people who have disappeared from existence.  Customer service and communication have never been good, Roman had always tried to make it up to us, but now?  What the hell is going on?   Take or money and don't deliver the goods?   Never again will we go here or recomend Lawless.   Don't get robbed and go through what we are now, out several hundred dollars and nothing to show for it.   Steer clear!
