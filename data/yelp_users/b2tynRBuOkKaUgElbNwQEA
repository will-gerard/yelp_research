I used this airline for the first time to fly into Idaho falls this last Friday. I have never used a small airline like this, I normally fly out of Phoenix Sky Harbor. However, Idaho falls is a very small town and it was the only way I could get here without driving for 3 hours.  First thing that was kind of weird was that I spent nearly 30 minutes waiting in the check-bag line, at the very front of the line, and there was NOBODY THERE TO CHECK THE BAGS. It was 11:00am and everyone was standing in line like "what?" I wasn't in a big rush because I was really early for my flight, but I could see other people in line getting really annoyed.  Of course my bag was a couple pounds over the 40 pound limit so I got charged $50. Which, totally my fault. I knew of the charges. But $50 for a couple pounds? UGH.  Then, we were told that there was something wrong with the plane so we had to have it switched out. It didn't push our flight back but any plane issues leave me feeling uneasy about flying. And, after reading other reviews about their planes being super old and breaking all the time, I am NOT looking forward to my flight back to Phoenix.   After looking at other reviews, I was surprised that I had no delays at all. We left early and arrived at our destination early. Normally on bigger airlines I find myself waiting around for the plane to take off but with this flight we were headed to the runway and I found myself thinking "we're leaving already? What?"  I felt pretty good about the actual flight, until the landing! I have anxiety about flying in general, but was feeling really calm as the flight had been very smooth so far. It wasn't bumpy, there weren't a lot of climbs/falls (which I'm sure are normal but always freak me out!). So when I heard that we had approached our destination and we're coming in for a landing, I felt so relieved. Landing is my favorite part, because it's when I finally feel safe again (lol). Not this time! I swear, this pilot did not even care. He had turned the plane towards Idaho falls and, while still being at our highest point, starts letting the plane nose dive towards the ground. I kid you not, we were falling out of the sky.   I was getting EXTREMELY light headed and thought I was going to pass out. It felt like I was on a drop ride that never ended! Finally the plane stabilized and I felt like I was going to throw up. I thought that was it! I thought we were all going to die. It happened a few more times and each time I felt SO dizzy. Worst experience flying ever...never again after I get back home. REALLY hoping my flight back to Phoenix won't be as scary.

*Sigh*  I feel bad, because Riley's has been my nail salon for a few months now and I have loved going to them. It's cheap, it looks good, and the people there are friendly. They made me justify getting my nails done every couple weeks, something I love to do but had stopped doing for a year or so because it was an expensive thing to keep up with.  Well, I guess you get what you pay for. I finally had to take my acrylic nails off today because they were just too grown out and I wasn't going to get a new set done for another few days. Unfortunately when I got to my my right thumb and index finger I saw what I'm assuming is either a form of nail fungus or Pseudomonas, a bacterial infection.   I have never, ever in my life had a bacterial or fungal infection in all my years going to salons. It is obvious that there is a problem with the way they are disinfecting things here, and I was unlucky enough to get this. Now I can't get my nails done until it's gone, and who knows how long that will take. And, as you can see in the picture, my nails are TERRIBLE from the acrylic (Not their fault, just sad I'm going to have ugly, painful nails for a month at the very least).  Nothing against anyone who works there. But please, please sanitize your utensils! I cannot recommend that anybody try this place now. The cheap manicures are not worth an infected nail. Sorry Riley's. :(  TL;DR: Cheap manis aren't worth fungal/bacterial infections
