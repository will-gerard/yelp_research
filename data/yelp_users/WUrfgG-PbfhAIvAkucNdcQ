I've brought my Ray Bans here twice. Thankfully, both times it's been an easy fix and cost less than $15! Very impressed.

I've been seeing Heather H. since I moved to the valley 6 years ago.  We've done all different things with my hair over the years. I'm very particular with my highlights and I walk out happy (and perfectly blonde) every time!  I moved from Scottsdale years ago but she's is 100% worth the drive. I would recommend anyone to Heather! You will not be disappointed.

I've gone to this car wash a number of times. The first few times I went there everything was just ok. My car left cleaner than it went in, but not as clean as I would have liked it. The last time I was there I entered the wash bay and it never started. I didn't have time to go find an employee and wait in line again. My mom said she had experienced the same thing before. I really wish I had better things to say, there aren't many places to get a quick wash on this side of town.

I love this place. In the past I had called on a car and Tim told me to call the manufacturing company because he was certain that it was a recall. And it was!  My family and I have had several cars fixed here for all types of issues. They are honest and will explain everything to you in detail.  Recently, I had my car towed here and they were extremely friendly and accommodating, even around a busy holiday weekend.  Thank you for the excellent service! Nice to have someone close by you can trust.

I've been going to Precision Dental for 3 years now. Dr. Goates is very kind and gentle, everything you would want in a dentist. I have referred both my parents here and they love it as well. And 5 stars for Ashley who does my cleaning! So happy I found this place.

This was my first time to Bare Necessity and Elaine took extra good care of me. I received a 60 minute customized facial, my skin looks and feels amazing. The location is cozy and the decor couldn't be cuter. I will be returning for more!

Originally, I had gone here with a group of friends. It was a rainy day in the spring and they had a few cancellations. They were nice enough to squeeze our group of four in on the patio. The service was extremely slow but I wrote it off because we were an unexpected party.   This weekend I had a group of 8 meeting here. I called in the morning to try and change my 11:30am reservation to 7 guests. I couldn't get through all morning, when I finally did the lady who answered the phone informed me that they were closed due to a circuit breaker issue in the kitchen and that the manager called all the people who had reservations. I did not get a call from anyone regarding this issues. So at 11am on a busy Sunday I had to find a new place for me and six other people to get into.   I will say the food was very good the first time I went. But the service and this very inconvenient event probably won't have me returning.

I've been taking my dog here consistently since I adopted her in February. She is a smaller breed and they usually have her done in 3 hours. They do an excellent job grooming her and she always comes back to me as the same happy pup. Sophia always rips her bows out so now they put a cute (sometimes seasonal) bandanna on her!

This is by far my favorite place to have my car washed in the valley! It's super quick and my car always comes out clean. The complementary air freshener is an added bonus.

I was referred to Verve Wellness to see Dr. Erin Hill who specializes in acupuncture and Chinese Medicine. I went in today for my first appointment and was pleasantly surprised. Bethany, who I also made my appointment with, checked me in and Dr. Erin took my back right away.  I can't say how thorough Dr. Erin is! I've had acupuncture before but this was a whole new experience. I loved her attention to detail and her concern for my comfort.  As far as the facility- it's very pleasant and clean. I will definitely be returning!

I've dined here twice this week! I brought my parents along with me the second time, they were surprised by the decor and cleanliness of the establishment. I'm new to the pho world but so far I have enjoyed what I've ordered! I will be coming back for more.
