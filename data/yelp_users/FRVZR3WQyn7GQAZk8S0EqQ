During my 5 day stay in Phoenix where I ate in 15 places that ranged from dives to 5 star restaurants, my lunch at La Grande Orange was the favorite.   The bustling lunch crowd, the tight quarters, the booming sound system, the servers screaming out orders, the merchandise displays all cause sensory overload.   This place has more than a mere deli counter could possibly provide.  Like: sandwiches, sushi, salads, fresh made pizzas, pastries, beer & wine, etc...  I ordered 5 different items and all were absolutely delicious.  I'm a 5th generation NY'er from Manhattan.  Snide about food.  And I'd rather eat here at La Grande Orange than 120 year old Katz Deli on the lower east side.  Yeah La grande orange is that good.

Well prepared, nicely plated, generous portion, tasty food.  Service is upper crust, smart and well timed. Hints of Italian cuisine with a solid backbone of American staples.    I ate here twice, both dinners.  Re-said:  I over-ate here 2X because the food was so good & so big.   Outdoor patio dining area faces an ugly parking lot & adjacent homely neighbor restaurant, but you'll forgive that when the food is placed before you.  Decent wine selection, full bar.    Adult, serene dining in old town Scottsdale.

Wow! This is a breakfast restaurant on steroids.   The food is big (portions), the selection is humongous, the calorie count of most dishes is super high, and so is the flavor!  Prices are reasonable, really about Denny's level. Bambi & I ate, & ate & ate for $25.  I don't give out 5 star ratings liberally, this place earned my highest recommendation.

Destination worthy restaurant.  Amazingly good Thai food at uber reasonable prices.  Squeaky clean dining room & restrooms. The room in this little mom & pop place is actually pretty.   Friendly, smart service.  I live in the SF Bay Area which is loaded with Thai restaurants.  Cha da is better than 99% of them.

See all the 5 star reviews?  This cafe earns them.    I ate here 2X. Breakfast & dinner.  Both meals were tasty, refined, nice portion, pretty on the plate.    Small selection on a focused menu. Best quality ingredients used.  For dinner, bring your own wine bottle (be a sport - a good wine).  Corkage: $8.  Charming!

An older property that has been somewhat rehabbed and hip-i-fied.  But rusty bathroom fixtures, scuffed woodwork, clogged toilet plumbing, a non-working TV in my room are evidence that keeping this place up as a first class destination is a losing battle.  Other minor annoyances: Rowdy guests who scream 11pm,  constant loud Electronic Dance Music at the pool, long lines at reception check-in with just 2 desk clerks on duty.   The #1 asset = the location in the nicest part of old town Scottsdale. And just a 5 minute walk to the SF giants cactus league spring training camp stadium.   I stayed 5 nights. Would I return?  Probably not.
