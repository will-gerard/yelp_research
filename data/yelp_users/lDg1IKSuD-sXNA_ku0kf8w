I have been in this store a few times It was always a very average experience Today I worked with Patrick and this young man blew me away Patrick's level of knowledge his depth and breadth across the store and his expert listing skills made me want to buy everything in the store ! Super star service excellent personality . I will be back to work with Patrick again !

I can give one star for the size and selection. Be forewarned. You will receive no  help that  means ZERO  help  with any issues after the sale. Poor measurements were taken. I was charged to ship back a defective window covering and no one will respond to any issues. I warn you to be careful. My drapes are one and one quarter inch to 3/4 inch too short I was not given a choice in that matter. Product is not the quality it should be .Service has been nightmarish. My credit card company has been notified. I am a home remodeler and flipper so not my first go around. The installer is an independent contractor. You are better off to find a small local company that has a work room and people that would be held responsible. The sales people are just that. You will not get any call back or service follow up. e mails have gone unanswered Over all nightmarish experience

Zach. I'm glad you were able to 'reach out' Who did you reach ? it was not me. I had to 'reach out' and let your sales staff know that my level of frustration was now to the point where I was going to cancel with the credit card and have them issue a charge back. There is an enormous gaping hole in your process. The disconnect between the store experience and after sales service leaves me feeling like I shopped at two different stores. As a last note . Your sales staff are frustrated with this situation and are aware of it. When you are practicing managed dissatisfaction you are not providing customer service.

Situations arise and bad things happen. Mistakes and lack of communication and cause client frustration. I have to say the Shade store pulled it out of the black hole and saved the day ! In end it is all about how you handle the issue and they took care of me ! I am very happy with the product and finally I am satisfied with the end results In the end All is well that ends well Thank you Shade Store for stepping up and making it right !   I would recommend people based on the way you handled the situation and for your product as well.

Remember when the adults on the peanuts sounded  like Wa wa wa wah " that is what i am hearing in regards to Harkin's response   Parking is awful. The seats are gone before you get there and the prices are beyond . Here is what I want to hear Hey Joel " we are doing a 5.50 Matinee like AMC " We are going to bring back the Indie moves once in a while. Give me action not more words to cover up the mess. PS I live in midtown NOT driving to Shea and Scottsdale Road But thanks for suggesting that as a solution .
