My family and I have been coming for decades! We love the food and the people who work there! Very friendly and fast service! I recommend getting cheese on the chips they bring out!

Look else where! There are several things wrong with this complex.   1. Terrible parking! They only give you one spot (even with 2 bedroom apartments). The visitor parking is so limited there isn't even enough for the guests to all park there. They have some spots outside the gate but there are times when you have to park at the bar or business complex next door.  2. Awful office staff. They switched office staff a lot when I lived here. No one ever seemed to know what they were doing and were awful about giving maintenance repair messages. They take advantage of you as much as possible and try and get every penny on you from their polices and fees.  3. Not luxury apartments. Carpet/lament flooring needs to be replaced and appliances are not up to date. Nothing luxurious about them at all. Just below average apartments.  Pool and spa were also closed a lot because of maintenance.   For what you pay here, it is not worth it. I'm not one to be super picky or write reviews a lot either. But this place really gridded my gears, and I would never want anyone else to go through the experiences I had with this place... I would HIGHLY recommend elsewhere.

Hands down my all time favorite pizzeria! I've been going to this place since they first opened and I haven't found a place that some closes! Friendly staff, amazing food, and decent prices. If you get their pizza make sure you get ranch or their joes sauce to go with it!

It's an okay place if you are looking to save money on clothes. They have a wide variety and it's a good sized store. But their prices are similar to Ross and TJ Maxx's. So for me, I'm going to stick to those stores and get something unworn.   Also, I would never sell here. I brought in some stuff I was given and never worn and felt like the prices they offered weren't fair. If you sell to them make sure it's in style from the last few months and in season. And you'll get about $2 an item from them. So for me, I'm going to just stick to donating to Goodwill!
