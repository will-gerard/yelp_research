Service is friendly and fast.  I was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes even after being 4th  in line to order.  It's very clean.    But my sandwich was just ok.  Hard to eat.  Lettuce and onions are oddly chopped together in chunks that keep falling out of the sandwich.  The wheat roll was hard and chewy.  If you are going to make a great sandwich, you need fresh bread.  It's kind of a no-brainer.  The fact that someone else pointed out the stale wheat bread in a review from 3 years ago makes it pretty clear that they don't really strive for greatness.  Also BRING CASH.  There is a 35 cent additional fee for cards.

We always come here. It's a great quality cut in a fun atmosphere. I would rate it 5 stars if they'd allow appointments. The wait can be ridiculous.

We started our son here when he was about 12 months old.  I wish we had found it sooner!  He loved every minute of it!  They really treated us like family, especially Miss Sue.  She nicknamed my son "The Mayor" because he liked to stop and greet the other children as they came into class.  Since my husband and I both work, we would take him to the evening or weekend classes.  There weren't a lot of classes in his age group that fit into a working parents schedule so, shortly after his 2nd birthday, we had to quit.  The only class available was on a Saturday right before his nap.  Not optimal timing for a two year old!  We were very sad to leave.  If they had more evening and weekend classes, we probably would have stayed longer.   Go down and sign up for a free class! Your child will have a blast and make sure to tell them "The Mayor" sent ya!

Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like this place.  On our first visit, shortly after they opened, I ordered the Homestyle Turkey Club, my husband had the Chicken Salad sandwich and we ordered Chicken Tenders for our 2 year old.    My son's CHICKEN ARRIVED RAW IN THE MIDDLE.  Luckily, we had broken the tenders in half before giving them to him so he didn't eat any of it.  My husband took the chicken back to the counter and the manager came over and apologized.  She was extremely nice and I could tell she was mortified.  She assured us they would be slicing the chicken more thinly in the future.  She brought back the chicken now cooked perfectly and offered us a free dessert.  Our sandwiches were delicious but it took a long time for us to go back again after that,    We chalked it up to a new restaurant, new cooks, etc, and recently decided to give them another try.  We decided to get lunch to go and my husband went to pick it up.  When he got home we opened it up to find that the bread on my sandwich was completely burnt.  Not dark, burnt.  It's sad because the menu is good, they are friendly, its a good location.  They just seem to have no standards.  We won't be back.

Saw the Chef on Channel 3 and everything he prepared for them looked amazing and so fresh.  I was very excited to try it.     The service was great, we were seated quickly, our waitress was very friendly and helpful.  We ordered an appetizer - the fried gnocchi.  Great!  Crispy on the outside and cheesy gooey on the inside.  The caesar salads were ok, nothing special.    My husband ordered the veal manicotti and I ordered the eggplant rollatini.  The manicotti filling was a little under-seasoned so it was just ok.  The eggplant however, tasted like the freezer.  Weird.  Why would they freeze eggplant?  I thought it didn't make sense so it must just be me.  I ate the filling out of it and pushed the weird tasting eggplant to the side.  Then we decided to split the desert sampler.  The Sfogliatelle was DELICIOUS!  But the Rum Baba had that same gross freezer taste again.  I asked the waitress and she confirmed that the desserts do come in frozen...blech.  Don't waste your time on that one - (unless it is for the visuals because lets just say - it's a great looking dessert for a bachelorette party).    I don't get all the 5 star reviews for this place.  We must've ordered the wrong things.  After tax and tip we left $100 lighter and I really don't feel like it was worth it.

The worst!  Usually only 3 or 4  jets are turned on at a time.  With a kid sitting or standing on each one and the rest of the kids just standing around waiting for a chance to get wet.  Don't waste your time and save your child the frustration.  Go down to Downtown Gilbert under the water tower.  All the jets are on, lots more fun!  The only downside there is no shade so slather on the sunscreen and have your kid wear a swim shirt.

We couldn't be happier with our decision to enroll our son at IKM.  It was a long drawn out process of researching, reading reviews, and visiting schools but in the end I believe we have made the best decision for our son.   On my first visit to the school, Ms. Diana greeted me for a tour of the classrooms.  As we toured the building,  I was impressed that she knew each student's name and I saw more than one student come up to give her a hug or show her what they were working on.  I could tell that she takes a hands-on approach as owner.     I was also impressed by the beautiful and clean classroom environment.  The rooms are well set up to encourage the children to explore on their own in the true Montessori fashion.  It was better done here than at some of the other schools I toured.  Ms. Kim's class was busy at work - all of the children engaged in their own activities.  I did have an opportunity to talk with her and was happy to discover that she has 10 years of Montessori teaching experience.   What also stood out to me about this school is that they put a great deal of thought into their aftercare program.  My husband and I both work full time and we needed a preschool that offered extended care for working parents.  At some of the schools I toured, the children went to a separate room to play with toys until their parents arrived.  Not so at IKM, they have a structured program with activities scheduled every day.  It could be a cooking activity, a science experiment, an art project, etc.   My son loves going to school every day and his progress has been astounding!  At three, he is able to recognize sight words and sound out words and he is working on handwriting as well as basic math concepts.  More than that, his social development has improved.  He did struggle with sharing and had some aggression problems.   But the staff at IKM, especially his teacher, Ms. Kim, has been patient and loving, helping him to use his words and redirecting him to other tasks.  My son adores her and even asked if he can invite her and Ms. Dulce (her assistant teacher) to his birthday party!  We get weekly updates from Ms. Kim as well as twice yearly parent/teacher conferences.  I can email any of the staff at any time and always get a prompt response.  All in all, this first year has been a wonderful experience and we can't wait to see what next year will bring!

I don't write a lot of reviews but I really felt the need in this case to let other parents know about Nancy's course.  Like the previous reviewer, our son struggled at commercial swim schools.  He was not progressing and the instructors were content to let him practice the same 3 or 4 things week after week, never pushing him to do more. We'd sit there frustrated, behind the glass, watching him treat the class as social time.  After months of lessons, our 5 year old still lacked the confidence to float unassisted.    Well we just had our 5th lesson with Nancy yesterday and I am thrilled to say that not only is he floating unassisted, he can flip over and float on his front and his back.  It's taking time to "unlearn" the improper techniques he had developed with his other lessons but he is gradually learning how to breathe properly, how to float, and how to tread water.  Basic survival techniques that were not taught at any of his previous lessons.  Nancy is a wonderful instructor who knows how to get the best out of him.  She keeps the lessons entertaining and challenging.  She doesn't allow him to get away with half measures.  She will stop him if she sees him doing an exercise improperly.  She explains to him why she is stopping him and why she wants him to do it the way she does.  When he finally executes the move perfectly, BOY DOES SHE CELEBRATE IT and I can see his face fill with pride at his accomplishment!  Best of all, now that we are able to actually hear what is going on, we can better replicate and reinforce her lessons in our own pool.  I didn't think we could afford private lessons but now that I see the difference in the level of instruction and how much can be accomplished in a short amount of time, I feel sick when I think about the $$$ we wasted at the big name swim schools.
