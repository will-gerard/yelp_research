Came here today for the .49 cent wings with co-workers. Wings were good, but the service was bad. Very slow. Rarely got drink refills. Food took forever to come out (upwards of an hour for wings). Nice enough person, but we rarely saw her.   Most other Natives are great, but this one in particular has consistently slow service.

Charleston's is always good! My wife and I had a great dinner here tonight after a road trip and we couldn't have picked a better spot. I had a delicious bison burger and it was perfect and my wife had a salad. Of course we are way too many of their honey drizzled croissants. Those are amazing.   Also a huge compliment to our server Danielle. She was super professional, friendly, and nice. The food and her service made our night! Thanks Danielle!

This is some of the best Italian in the entire valley. It's a quaint place with really nice atmosphere and friendly staff. The food is where it really shines. I can't say enough about it. The Pasta di Trio and Lasagna are amazing! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. It is a bit pricey however.

I'm finally writing a review, this is the last straw. I don't know how I can trust this dealership. I've brought my Jetta in numerous times for oil changes and routine maintenance and ever time I've felt that they've tried to take me for a ride and rack up unnecessary charges. I always dismissed it and chocked it up to "the dealership service is always more expensive", but never have we been flat out lied to...well at least that we are now certain of.  I work quite a bit so I asked my wife to bring our car in for an oil change(being a Jetta TDI they are actually cheaper than going to Jiffy Lube and the like for this service). Apparently they thought they could take advantage of her because they told her that the battery was bad and needed replacement (roughly 8 months old) and that there was a nail in the rear right tire and causing low pressure and it was in a place that couldn't be repaired. When I took it to Discount Tire across the street the found that, while there was a nail in the tire, it could absolutely be repaired and they did it for free. We did not need to buy new tires. Either he didn't know what designated a irreparable spot or he was just trying to seek new tires.   I wouldn't post a review unless this happened many times before, this had just been the most blatant. I will never take any of our cars there again and I'd advise no one else to. They will try to sell you other services, whether it's necessary or not.  *update* I decided to give the dealership another chance. I had an issue with my ignition and a local shop was giving me s really high quote. I called Berge again because they are so close to my home, just hoping to get a quote. The service advisor I talked to, which was the same as previous, told me that his manager does not want to do business with me because of the above review. I've been in the customer service industry almost my entire working career and I've never heard of this before. I was giving them a second chance to make things right and instead of taking that opportunity they decided to show me the door. Wow!

This was a decent place. I really liked the atmosphere, the server was really cool and on point. Cool Irish pub. The burger I had could've been a bit better. Wasn't bad, but wasn't all that great. Would definitely come again to try some fish and chips. Cool place.

I've been taking my work truck here for the past two years. Sure they try to sell you on more repairs then what you bring it in for, but I could care less about that (it's a work truck nothing gets done that's not OK'd anyways).   What I do care about is someone being took lazy to put down some paper when you get into the vehicle and you're covered in grease and oil. Really? Oil and grease all over the carpet on the floor, the door, the trim, the mats, the base of the seat. This is unacceptable. It should be something that's automatic and very easy. I will not be going back to them again. Only gave them an additional star because they are generally very fast and they get me in and out. I cannot however allow them to cause damage to my work vehicle.

My wife and I did the "cut your bill in half" promotion and switched from AT&T. We saw that we would get a great rate and it would be locked in for 2 years. Fantastic. We come in and get everything switched over. While the sales lady is filling everything out with us right there in front of her we made sure that we did not have insurance put on our phones. It's a complete rip off anyways. Get everything finalized, get our new phones, walk outside...realize that we aren't on a 4G network...just great. I knew there would be problems.  First of all we can barely ever connect to the Internet or any web based apps unless we are on wifi, first real issue. Next we realize that we can't talk and use web based programs at the same time....guess I should have done my homework on Sprint. Then comes our first bill in the mail and low and behold it's about 25 dollars more expense then we were told by the sales lady. After examining the bill we see that she put the insurance on our account when we told her not to. When I brought this up to an ex-sprint manager who is a friend of mine he informed me that they will always do that and if the customer has asks about whether it's put on initially they are too lie about it and put it on anyways. (one reason why he left). Guess I should have listened to him about that.   The bill is now due in 4 days (which we relieved no notification on when it would be due by any means) and I my wife and I go into this same store to resolve the bill. I tell him we won't pay the insurance which we asked not to have on there and he said, sure we'll take it off, it will take about 48 hours to post. I check it today, no dice. Now the bill is due tomorrow and the charge is still on there(what did the guy at the store do?). So I call CS and he informs me that he has resolved the issue and it will be taken off the bill in 24 hours, the day my bill is due. I really hope so.   This has not been a pleasant experience with Sprint. The network is bad, the sales reps are deceptive and issues don't seem to get resolved. I would not recommend going to this store or even Sprint as a whole for that matter.

Went there today for lunch. Good as always! Decent prices for lunch as well. Chicken was a little on the dry side today, but that's not the usual.

So I haven't been to a Macayo's in a long time. (It's a phoenix tradition) my wife has never been so I knew I need to take her. We came on a Friday night and it was ridiculously packed. To our surprise though they got us sat within 10 minutes! The staff was super busy and we got just slightly over looked, but they were amazing about and gave us a free appetizer. Everyone from the managers to the servers was super nice and friendly.  So I'm a bit of a tamale snob. I love them! I had a two tamale plate one with red sauce and one with baja sauce....thy were amazing. Two of the best tamales I've ever had. I would definitely recommend the baja sauce, was sweet and spicy, though both were great.  So my wife had a great first experience and even though they were super busy and I was a little hectic, they got us sat quickly and was super accommodating for any inconvenience! We will be back.

Stopped by here on a lunch break with a co-worker for their taco Tuesday specials. We should have listened to the reviews. While the deals were great and the tacos were delicious, the other issues were just too much.  First of all the service is terribly slow. You're lucky if you get a drink refill. The tacos, like I said, were good, but good luck getting the ones you ordered or with the proper toppings. I got completely different tacos than I ordered and my co-worker got a taco with avocado in it which he told the server he couldn't eat because he was allergic. When the waitress brought the taco up to the cook and told him about the mess up with the avocado we saw him laughing about it behind the counter.  Halfway through our meal our first waitress just stopped coming to the table so we had another server come around and help and she was great, but still it was very bizarre.  If you go don't expect to get good service or the meal you actually ordered. I won't be coming back again.

Wow, what a great place! Everything I've had here is great from breakfast burritos to hummus/veggie sandwiches. I would definitely recommend this place. There whole grade bread is also amazing and they also have gluten-free options. Sorry I don't have any pics, I will post them next time I go in, because I will definitely be back.

Wow, great place. It's slightly expensive, but really not any more so than Cold Stone and I think much better! I would come again and definitely recommend.  I had milk and cookies and peanut butter chip, I would recommend both.

Amazing as always! Royal With Cheese is quickly becoming one of my favorites. Definitely recommend that one. It's amazing how many times we've come to this place and they've always remained consistently great.

What a great place! The ice cream is always delicious and it's cool to watch them make it. It's a great place for kids too with the great cartoon movies they always have playing and because again, it's really cool to watch them make it.   Definitely a great place for a family dessert run.

This is my wife and my first stop here. All I can say is delicious! We both had an egg/pancake meal and it was one of the best breakfasts we've had...and we're breakfast people. Surprisingly it's actually really affordable as well, even with added drinks and specialty pancakes!   My wife had the strawberry pancakes and I had the protein power pancakes, both were great! They are apparently know for their pancakes.  It was a bit of a long line, but that's to be expected with how busy it is. We will definitely be coming back again when we're in the area....or even if we're not, we'll make the trip.  p.s. My wife wanted me to mention that they serve Harney and Sons tea. A hot commodity apparently among tea drinkers.

This place is very good for s quick, affordable sandwich. I'm sure there's better sandwiches out there for more money, but this beats the pants off subway, Quiznos, any of those. Definitely recommend toasting your wich.

This is a really great little taco shop. I haven't been here too much and haven't tried all their menu yet, but what I have had been really tasty. Nothing mind blowing hence the 4 stars, but you definitely can't go wrong.  I would definitely recommend trying the Al Pastor meat. It's something I haven't seen anywhere else and never tasted anything like it. Very interesting and delicious! The prices are also pretty affordable.

Just came here for the first time for lunch during a work day. Had just a plain cheeseburger with chips and it was delicious. The chips were by far the best part. Huge cut chips, tasty. I wish I had gone with something a little more risky on the burger because they had some pretty interesting options, maybe next time.  The staff was also super friendly and attentive and they got us in and out quick which is appreciative when you're working. Great place and would definitely recommend.

This is a great place. Delicious food. Good service. I had the Green Eggs n Hammie, would definitely recommend it. My wife's yogurt parfait and grapefruit creme brûlée looked equally delicious. They also have a really cool outside patio area with games. Would come again.  The only downside is it's a tad on the expensive side for us. Other than that, it was a great experience.

This place is amazing! Just discovered it. The guy who owns the place is super cool and he really likes to bake and it shows. The food is delicious. He has 3 different savory baked bites and some sweet ones as well. The to savory ones that I tried (burrito and green chili pork) were delicious!  I definitely recommend this place. He makes everything fresh, from scratch. It's great to support a local business and this one is legit!

This was a whole lot of fun! I never even knew something like this existed until a friend brought it up. We went with eight people and it was a blast. The best I can describe it as is a interactive IQ test. It's fun to work with your friends and family to figure things out and you feel like you really accomplished something by the end of it. I definitely want to come back and try the other room!  If you're looking to do something fun and different with a group of friends I would definitely try this place out. Bring a good size group too. Even with 8 I feel like everyone had something to contribute and the time went by fast. Fun stuff!

This was the first and only time I'll be going to this theater. First of all I can't really even call it a theater, it's more like a cocktail lounge that happens to play some movies down its sterile and cold hallways. No movie cutouts, no warm, inviting look, just lots of wood paneling, and overly sharpened, poor looking, digital movie posters. The luxury seats weren't as comfortable as cinemark down in Mesa.   Oh and speaking of cinemark, this is about 5 dollars a ticket more! 14 dollars for your basic movie ticket! Are you out of your mind? IMAX3D at AZ Mills is 12. Not only is this one of the worst feeling theaters I've ever been to I'm also paying a premium price for it but, you know.....it's Scottsdale.

So glad a coffee shop finally opened near my home. This is a great Starbucks. Not much really to share new on the review, if you've been to a Starbucks then you know what to expect.   This particular Starbucks is very roomy however, on the larger side for a Starbucks. Lots of seating and lots of plugs for phones and notebooks. There's definitely other Starbucks with more comfortable seating, but the environment is still relaxed. The workers are very friendly. Check out my picture for a delicious drink recipe that they shared with me. I get it every time now.

Ok, so this place is amazing! If you are an old school gamer or even a new school gamer...go check this place out. I've been playing games since the late 80's on my Sega Master System and its so awesome to be able to see all the old systems and games I used to play...and yes they have master system games.  The prices are also very affordable for an indie games boutique. I just picked up a copy of Tetris Worlds for my GameCube. Seriously folks, go check this place out. The owners are super cool too. Just go in and chat with them. I spent my first trip there simply sharing our love for video games, I'm sure they'd love to talk video games with you. If I had all the monies I would never leave this place...or at least frequent it daily. Great place!

I really liked this place. I've never been to another Dickey's so I don't have any reference how they usually are, but I've been here 3 times since they've opened and every time it was delicious.   The staff is really friendly and it smells so stinking good when you walk in, I want that smell piped into my house. It's decently priced, not the cheapest place in the world, but I've been to more expensive BBQ. It's also great that it's so close to home.
