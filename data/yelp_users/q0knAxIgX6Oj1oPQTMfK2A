food is great here no matter what you order it  speaks volumes when the actual food is better looking than the pictures.

Came here for a VIP event and Id have to say that's was the best all around experience I've had at west gate. Brianna was our server and she went above and beyond for everyone in my group. The music was good and the crowd was friendly. If you haven't stopped by here yet its definitely a place to visit.

the food here is amazing the portions are great and the prices are right on point. it is difficult to find good foreign restaurants in this area but this is one of them.

So I've been frequenting this fine establishment for the last few years and I gotta say this place never disappoints. There service is amazing they're always smiling and making you feel welcomed and there food OMG there food beats the service which is impossible to comprehend but it does!!! I lve tried a few different items and have always left satisfied today however I went in with a different mindset as in I needed some comfort food. This is where Pita Kitchen excels, I ordered the gyros entree and Greek bruschetta, first time for the latter which came out 1st and I'm so glad it did because it was one of the most pleasant surprises I've encountered in any food establishment in a very long time. Soon after the entree showed up and like I said I've had it many times before but that didn't matter because it tasted like the very first time again which needless to say is pretty epic. I could write a novel and not do this gem of a place  justice so I'll leave with the tip that if you love amazing food and great service it doesn't matter what part of the valley you are in, it is definitely worth the drive and some.

What's the point of keeping the drive through open if only two menu items will be available after closing the doors. I understand trying to limit closing costs and running out of stock but it seems a bit farfetched that they just so happen to not have certain items ready heading into closing hours. I've been to plenty establishments but only had the same issue in the old central location. Sad to see this is becoming the norm of an old childhood favorite.
