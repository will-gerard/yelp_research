Been coming here for 14+ years. Love everything about this place! Being Italian love coming to pick up some Italian products and grab a lunch too.The pesto pasta is the best! My sons love the Italian beef sandwich.

This has to the worst breakfast place ever!!! The food was gross!! Although our service was good. First off the coffee was ok and there was no fresh cream only package cream, second we asked our server about the chicken fried steak. He said it was the best thing on menu. But it comes frozen!?!? After our food came we asked a few more questions because it didn't taste right. Everything they have and serve is FROZEN!!!!! Even the eggs are not real eggs! They come in a huge bag!!! My eggs Benedict I took back because the eggs and hollandaise was all watery!!! I don't get it. This place was packed?!?! We will never eat here again!!!! Waste of money!!! It only gets one star for our server!
