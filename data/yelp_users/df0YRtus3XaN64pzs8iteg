I thought the food was average. Nothing special but nothing to complain about. But I felt really gross after eating it. Tummy bloated and a lil achy. I don't think I'll be returning. I think I'll have to settle with PF changs or panda for my chinese food cravings... Real big bummer cuz i love authentic chinese cuisine.

I didn't come here til after dinner and they still had every flavor available. We got 2 cream filled, an old fashioned, chocolate glazed and original glazed and of course their famous fritter for our friends. I tried the old fashioned and the fritters and thought they were delish. My friends loved the cream filled. Great job Greenbush!

if you don't know, you better ask somebodayyy!  BEST brunch ever! the steak &eggs is freaking delicious! The plate comes with fresh fruit, toast and obrien potatoes (BOMB). My friends ordered the buckwheat pancakes and LOVED them. The service is awesome too.   fyi... On weekends, prepare to wait at least half an hr before being seated. This place is packed! Parking is okay.

Great place to have dinner if you're in the neighborhood. This place doesn't take ressies which is a bummer but they were able to accommodate us fairly quickly. I had a great time here. Food and drinks were good and service was great. I had their old fashioned (of course), bloody mary and their cherry ale. As for food, we got the bacon mac & cheese, fish fry, beef jerky, sausage platter and fried cheese curds. Everything was great. I especially liked the curds! A must!

Fun atmosphere, good food and great service. I always order baby back ribs & beef ribs at every BBQ joint I visit. Bobby Q's is very good. You get a ton of food for your dinero. The sides were just okay for me though.

Arizona definitely lack cool spots, but luckily they have The Vig. The venue has a nice patio area--perfect for warmer nights, but the inside tables are fine too.     My friends brought me on a Sunday night where all their bottle wines are 50%off... which is pretty awesome. The service was friendly and the food was legit. Try the "Good ol' Steak Salad" and Crabmeat Artichoke dip!   btw the valet is $3.

I don't typically go to chains for brunch but I was pleasantly surprised with Mimi's. Service was good and accommodating. I wouldn't say they were as good as other independent brunch restaurants... but overall, i had a good experience here.

Ive been here a handful of times and food and service is always good. There's nothing special about their food selections-- everything is traditional and simple. I really do like this place if i'm looking for a fast and healthy bfast. and best of all, everything is less than $10.

I really like sushi broker. Don't expect authentic sushi here but it's mad tasty! Best of of all is their happy hour menu. It's 3-6:30 everyday. They offer reverse HH too. There's 20-30 food items and discounted drink specials. My favorite roll is the surfer and I think it's the most expensive one on their HH menu at $12.75, def worth it though! Another plus is that they have tons of tvs for your sporting needs. Really fun atmosphere!

This restaurant is contracted with the Hilton Garden Inn as their dinner room service. I had their salmon, spinach, artichoke pasta for dinner and it was great. It came w a side salad and a baked potato. There was enough food for leftovers the next day. They charge a $1 delivery fee + an automatic 18% gratuity. So worth it! Definitely a better option than what the downstairs kitchen has to offer.

This lil hole in the wall is amazing and always hits the spot after a long weekend of partying on the strip.  its seems like a family owned business which i love bc the food is usually more authentic and yummy that way.   prices are super low and portions are large, service is good, plenty of parking. the end.

Came here immediately after landing. I was bummed out by their flight selection bc they had about 15-20 different drafts on the list but more than 50% were crossed out bc they were considered seasonal. Nevertheless, the ones I chose were good and HUGE. Service was good and the atmosphere was laid back.

Came here for the Saints & Lions game a couple days ago w a few friends and I'm glad we did! We got a nice table outside in the patio area where we had the tv right in front of us. It was also happy hour so we got great deals on drinks and appetizers. I recommend the dirty chips... those were really good. Our server was nice and chill. I would definitely come back.. I had an awesome time.

This place was PACKED! so I assumed it was going to be delish. But was sadly disappointed. The flavors were off. I always get the original tart everywhere I go, and yogurtini's version just didnt taste right.   If i were to ever crave some froyo, i'd rather go to pinkberry or yogurtland.

Such a fun place! Came here for a bday shindig but was way more captivated by the Chargers game. There were plenty of tvs which I very much appreciated. The staff was attentive wo being annoying. Drinks were cheap and crowd was not too shabb. This would be a fun spot for Sunday football as well. Not sure if you need to pay for the cabanas.. But it's a pretty cool concept. Would def come back

Subpar food even for an airport location. Got their house special fish fry. It came with 3 small pieces of fish and some fries. Really nothing special. The service was alright. I really wished I grabbed a quiznos sandwich next door instead.

THE WORST COMPANY EVER! DO NOT BOOK THEM!!!!  My friends and I purchased the 3 day EDC shuttle pass for $45 each, but because of their awful organization and lack of resources, we did not even get to use our pass once!!! We waited over 3 hours on Friday and ended up paying $20/head to another bus service to hitch a ride to EDC. On Saturday, we decided to try them again at 11:30 and someone said they stopped rides. Their tickets said they would be transporting every 20-30 minutes... WRONG! That night,  we ended up paying for a $100 cab ride. On Sunday, we thought of using them as our ride back to the Strip, but again, we had to find another way. We paid another $20 each to return.   The man who was dealing with this company said he would be giving our money back but now, he is dodging all phone calls and emails!   They are THEE most awful company ever! COMPLETE RIPOFF!! i'm pretty sure any positive review is from their friends and family!!! they suck!

Perfect place for Sunday football! They have tons of tvs playing every game. Heaven for fellow fantasy football participants. The staff was on point and the food was really good. I def recommend the chicken and waffles from their breakfast menu. The chicken tenders were cooked to perfection and the waffles were so fluffy!! All for like $9 or something. They have a pretty good Bloody Mary for $4 on their early bird drink menu as well. My friends and I had a great time here! If I lived in az, I'd def make this place a regular spot for football sundays.

OBH is the nearest legit breakfast/brunch place in the 85050 area code. I always order something different and am never disappointed. I've had their omelettes, French toast, chicken fried chicken, pancakes, and many other dishes. Service is great and homey. The wait is pretty nuts on weekends so prepare for 30 minute wait time, minimum. The price tag is super reasonable with just about everything under $15. Def a must if you're in the area.

My tummy always has a good time here! Food is so good, I've probably had 6 different burgers and they're all so delish. Definitely a solid spot, and you always leave so satisfied!

Came here for restaurant week with some friends and every one of us were glad we made the decision to come here! I got the pan-seared scallops on corn grits with the chopped salad and bread pudding! I also had the pleasure in trying the chimichurri chicken, scallop chowder, short ribs, mozzarella fondue and chocolate flourless torte, in addition to 4 different whiskys. Every thing was really good except for the fondue and bread pudding. I could have done without, but everything else was amazing! Our waitress (Courtney) was a doll, she was so nice and helpful! With drinks, the bill wasn't cheap but def worth the experience. I'm a whisky fan so this place holds an extra special place in my foodie heart.

My bf surprised me w a couples massage here and it was amazing. The ambiance is perfect. I loved their Moroccan themed d√©cor. The staff was really nice and the massages were great. We didn't get to spend time in the pool or anything since it was a little cold and had engagements after, but I heard its fantastic. Overall a great experience! Would definitely recommend for special occasions!

Came here to try their ramen. I ordered the tonkotsu and spicy miso. Both pretty good. The broth was flavorful. Ramen had a more chewy consistency but not bad at all. The hospitality is so awesome here! Love the servers! Super polite and friendly. FYI, if you're going for the yakitori, they only serve that in the PM. Overall, a legit place especially for a city not known for Japanese cuisine.

Overall a fun experience. Right off the bat, i noticed their decor resembled Snooze's with all the fun colors and shapes. The wait for a table is reasonable before 9 am on a weekend-- maybe 20 minutes. The bar made delicious fresh orange juice-- great for mimosas and screwdrivers. The coffee was also nice and strong. My only gripe is the service seriously moved at a snail's pace! The wait just to take our order was at least 30 minutes, and then another 30 minutes to get our food. Though, I have to say the food was worth waiting for. Everyone was raving about it around the table.

I'm not sure if this Living Room is linked to the one in Boston, but I'd have to say this location is much better than its counterpart (if it is). We came for brunch after Halloween. The food was not memorable but I really enjoyed their $5 bloody mary bar. The service was also good and I did enjoy the seating arrangements.

Even an hour before they close, great donuts and fresh chicken is still available! I tried a slew of donuts... The Wisconsin, poppyseed lemon, lemon maple, glazed and rose meringue. My fave was the poppyseed lemon and Wisconsin. I think all the donuts plus an order of chicken came out to be a lil less than $20. My friend said its the best chicken she's ever had. In my opinion, it's def not thee best, but it's very good.   I would like to come back and try the other donuts

Don't expect to find fancy pants donuts here. They only have the classics stuff. But the stuff is tasty. My bf and i got 4 donuts thinking we could eat one now and then another one in the morning... that wasnt the case.. we killed them all in less than 30 minutes.

One of my least favorite places in the hood. The establishment charges similar to an upscale bar but does not give an upscale experience. Service was basically non existent. We weren't served at all, the bartender ended up coming to grab our orders because she felt bad for us. When the food arrived, it was really bad-- no one in our party of 8 enjoyed their food. Drinks were normal-- but took forever for us to order and get. I don't recommend coming here, there are too many other options around these streets.

Came here to catch some Saturday NCAAF games. It was pretty amazing that the staff was willing to change the game channels by customer request. We sat at the bar and every bartender we came across were friendly and extremely efficient. We ordered a slew of burgers and shakes and everything was delish! I am the biggest carnivore but decided on the jungle and it was sooo good! Everyone else ordered a real burger and enjoyed it too. Oh and for the sides, go for the sweet potato tater tots!

This place is awesome! Its super laid back and its perfect for Sunday Football! They have tons of TVs & seating-- indoor & outdoors . The drinks were good and so was the service. Because this is a new place, I heard the food is iffy. Hopefully, it gets better cuz this place has great potential!
