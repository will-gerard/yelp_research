There are far better Mexican places in Phoenix than this place. The atmosphere feels like a run down diner, their margaritas are not good, and the fajitas were alright I guess. Been there twice and I felt the same coming out both times.

New type of place for me with giant, not frozen, hotpockets? I'm down. Was excellent and the service great also. Been back twice since going here a couple months ago.   Is really small so plan on a wait. Or go to the Mesa one which is huge compared to the Tempe location.

Beautiful place. Just wish the taste of the food matched the decor.

"Meh. I've experience better" is pretty much all I can say about Chili's now a days.

This place used to be good but the new owners have gotten worse every time I go. The guy that serves you is nice and always friendly but it takes multiple times asking to get a refill on water. The quality of meat has slowly gone down hill also and today was the last time I will go. I usually either get Pho or the Deluxe. Stopped getting Pho because the beef was cheap and really fatty. Got Deluxe today and the sweet patatoe cakes were burned(black), noodles overcooked, beef was fatty and couldn't even chew it, and the chicken was alright. Also ordered the spring rolls and they were half the size of what they used to be. This place has been deserted the last few times I have gone and now I am sure I know why. They also used to have music playing all the time or the TV on. Last two times I went they didn't and this last time I could hear the cook banging stuff around while I was eating. Gave it a two because the spring rolls were at least good, even if they were very small.

BAD Bingo was a blast and the place was clean. Not somewhere I would go outside the Bingo room though.

Absolutely gorgeous! Farmers market, juice stand, bakery, eating areas, fresh roasted peppers, local grain fed beef jerky, etc were all awesome.

Had gift certificates so figured, why not? Got the sampler, some beers, and some mashed potatoes. Nothing in the sampler was particularly good...and the mashed potatoes tasted like nothing other than undercooked potatoes.

This place reminded me of Cracker Barrel, but the food wasn't overpriced and was actually good! Went here for "brunch" and wouldn't have known about it if it hadn't been for Yelp. Got a ham and cheese omelet that came with home style frys and toast. Also got coffee and with tip was only 11 bucks! I save 5 stars for when I am really amazed but would definitely go back.

Been twice now and was even better than the last. Have had the pot stickers, spring rolls, spicy nut chicken, cashew duck, eggplant beef, and all where fabulous. I haven't had good thai in a long time and this hit the spot. And my house is within their 3mile delivery area! But I would still probably make the drive as the place is nice and the service is excellent.

The Perch has a lot of things going for it:  1) Atmosphere is unique and exotic feeling with the birds being a great touch! 2) The craft brews are excellent and different from the other options in town.  3) The food menu is fresh and everything I've had is delicious...  but holy cow their service is unbelievably bad. Been here three times over the past two months and these were the experiences:  1) Saturday brunch a few months ago. Few tables but restaurant wasn't busy by any means. Table of three and it took us almost an hour to get our food and we sat with empty beers for half that time.   2) Saturday night about 3 weeks ago - Place was packed but didn't get served in the over an hour we were there. We started walking out and someone asks us if we wanted anything. No thanks - went to Coach & Willies and got served in under 5 minutes.   3) Sunday brunch. Swore I wouldn't come back after last time but like I said, really like the place aside from the service. There was 1 bar tender and 1 bar back for the entire downstairs bar and restaurant, which every table was full. Bartender was really doing his best but absolutely over worked. Took almost 20 minutes to get the sampler flight I ordered (we are sitting at the bar by the way). Took over an hour to get our food, which he kept saying would be out in 20 minutes and when it finally came out...very obviously had been sitting under the heat lamp for at least 10 and although it was good, it was warm at best, borderline cold. Probably would have sent it back elsewhere but I was hungry and didn't want to wait another hour.   As you can tell, this isn't just one bad night for them but ongoing for at least the past few months. Not sure how long they have been open either because I just moved down to Chandler but seems that they definitely could use some help in the management piece...and everyone I know that has been has come out with a similar experiences.   To the owners...you have a great place, please hire someone who knows how to run it and you'll be flying high with SanTan and FourPeaks in no time.

This location needs help from the Biltmore location. Cilantro was withered and not nearly as fresh as I am used to, tortillas were overdone to the point that part of it was actually crunchy, and the Horchata was really bland. Asked the girl to just put the pico on the taco but she insisted it had to be on the side - not a big deal but I didn't really understand why she had such an attitude about it. I had been raving about this place to my new coworkes (after going to the Camelback location once a week for the last 6 months) and although they thought everything was great, I am sad that I am going to have to find a new go-to place for Taco Tuesday.

Walked in before they were officially open and ended up getting a free meal! Got the burger they had on special for the month (forgot the name but it had a fried pickle in it) and it was delicious...and huge! Ops Manager came around and gave me a pumpkin pie shake as well. Will definitely be going back when I want a gourmet burger!

This place is genius - now build more so there isn't a 3 hour wait every night. :)

I've lived in Chandler for two years and pass this place all the time but always thought it was closed (the sign is a bit haggard). Anyway, I started a new job and some of the girls were talking it up so I decided to go to Taco Tuesday with them. $5 for 3 carne asada street tacos with a drink! The fresh salsa bar was great also and although the line was a bit long, the food came out quick and hot. Definitely will be back!

Been here twice now and definitely hits the spot! I've tried the standard Gyro and the Chicken. The chicken had really good flavoring but a bit too dry and the Gyro was phenomenal. I like that they don't overdo it on the tzatziki sauce like a lot of places and the amount of meat they stack on the thing is great, especially for the price.

Used to dislike dark chocolate but apparently I had just never had real chocolate to begin with! Did the factory tour last week and the owners were great, very open about the process and very passionate about what they do. No more Hershey's for me!

Took my mom and step dad here last weekend after hearing great reviews from my friends. Food was excellent, place was clean and the server was pretty attentive. We got King Crab Legs, Snowcrab legs and a whole lobster with the trifecta sauce. It was all excellent and the sausage and corn were as well. Mom had some ribs also and those were great too. Bit of a wait on Sunday night but was only 10-15 minutes. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the way the menu works - I really wanted to try a bit of everything but Angry Crab only lets you order a minimum of 1 pound of each type. So unless you come with 5 or more people, or have a huge appetite and $200+ to spend, there is no way to have more than 2-3 things of the 9 different kinds of fresh seafood on the menu. It would be nice if they had a some type of combo offering like Joe's but other than that - it was excellent.
