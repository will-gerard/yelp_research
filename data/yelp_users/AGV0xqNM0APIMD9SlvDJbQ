Great place to see a show with a diverse crowd. Metalachi was the band that played and they did not disappoint. The acoustics at the Rhythm room were top notch. Views were good as I sat at the corner of the bar and could see the band just fine. Staff was friendly and fast.  I'd go back to see a show anytime.

Another great trip to Mrs. White's!  Had the southern fried chicken with mixed greens and Mac n cheese.  Everything was fresh and crispy. Chicken was crunchy but not greasy and the greens, well they were phenomenal!!!  Mac n cheese is always creamy but not runny like some. Washed down with a great glass of red kool aid and I drove home drowsy!!!   Thanks again to the staff!!!

Had yet another great experience at Baci. I had to run out early and they boxed up all my food to go and gave some free desert as well. I got home and my gnocchi and chicken Alfredo pizza were still as warm as it was on the plate. Always a nice place for dinner!

We just keep coming back for the excellent food and service here. I took a party of 30 (reservation was made) and everything went off without a hitch!  Can't be happier with this place!

Great 1st time experience. Staff was friendly and courteous. Food was awesome. I had the mozzarella and tomato pesto panini and it was phenomenal. Spinach was abundant and not overly drizzled with pesto. Bread was fresh and hot. My wife had the turkey and Brie with fig. Another excellent panini. We split our meal because they were that good! Can't wait to go back.

Looking forward to the food!  I couldn't get off the sweets! First off the staff was very friendly and the place was extremely clean. We ordered the strawberries con creme to start. Very fresh as we watched them prepare them in front of us. Then we got some strawberry ice cream. Gotta say, we enjoyed their ice cream over stonecold. Finished off with a lime slushy.  Real Lime Juice!!!  Very refreshing!  Great place to get those "Kravings" out of your system.

This is just personal preference however the truck was an awesome atmosphere. The guys in the truck were very friendly and courteous. The Strawberry Lemonade was great as well. However my Carolina pulled pork frites were lacking as the Carolina sauce was heavy on the mustard and not enough tang for a Carolina bbq. The fries and pork however were top notch with a nice shred for the pork and a nice crisp but not greasy on the fries

Probably the worst car wash I've ever gotten. First it took 20 minutes to get to the vacuum station as I watched my truck sit outside as three employees sat around drinking energy drinks and chatting. Then the poor guy who was vacuuming was working on three vehicles. He gets the only star as he actually worked. The trick finally went through the was and I literally watched the attendant dry he truck then called for it to be done. I had to ask them to do the tires and rims as part of the upgraded package I purchased.  The mirrors and windshield were spotty and the interior want even wiped down.   Don't waste your money on this place.

Service was horrible. Not only did the server talk me out of the Chicago style deep dish (he said it was going to take over an hour) and recommended a pan instead but the pan took over an hour anyway. When I got the pizza finally, everyone had already gotten their food and ate most of what they had. Funny thing is I saw the table next to me, that was seated after me order the deep dish. Their deep dish came 15 minutes before I got mine. Pizza was average at best.
