Eeeeee. Long yet important message to follow!!  If I was blind and If this place gave me the ability to see again.... Eeeeeehhhh I still wouldn't go back.  The first time I went, a few years back it was good. Good food! Then got take out and yeah, just well cooked good food. Nothing to write home about but still good.   This time... Wild tiger turned into wild sloth. Arguably just as cool in animal comparison but the tiger could, if he so chose to, rip apart the sloth with vigor.   The hostess was hard to find and inattentive. Se really wasn't present or rememberable. We sat down and ordered. Waters came out. Then our app. It was some roll thingy. It tasted like frozen shrimp wrapped in rice paper for 9 bux. Oh oh oh it tasted like the rolls you get at the sushi place in Safeway. Yea no thanks. Plus the waiter seemed to disappear. A while later the food was delivered. Hhmm. Pad Thai you say? Uh nope! Well if you call over cooked noodles shoved under a huge pile of cabbage pad Thai the yeaaa.. I guess.  Curry you say.... Hmmm nope just over spiced over cooked and tasteless except for the over spice thing.., which is just down right confusing.   The waiter never came back to check on us. My lady dropped her eating utensil on the ground and I went inside to get another. Standing at the empty hostess station looking around....looking....still looking....oh oh hey  hostess can I have a.. She cuts me off. "I'll be back" denied!!!! By the drive by host from a terminator movie.  Well waiting still. Find someone. Utensils. Cool. Thanks. Sorry to be a bother as a paying customer.    Then I sit back down. Take a few bites and realize everything tastes the same. Cold, over cooked and over spiced.  So in effort to try to salvage this meal I try to ask for some limes. Guess what... Shocker..... It took me getting up to find someone. Cool got em. Cool, great, not real limes. Just little ones, like the ones you use for Mexican food!! Wtf!!!   Anyways. Forcing it down cuz I'm sick of the search party of two game that they have thrust upon us, the waiter still never came back. The lady bussing the tables cleared our stuff except for the untouched pad Thai. We actually tipped the bus lady she was nice and a very hard worker.  Still Wait Ing  Oh wait I forgot the rules of the game.... I got up to search for the check. Yeaaaa! At what point do I win? And really what could the prize be?   Oh nothing. I guess you could say I win by not ever having to go back there.   Sad really. Was a good place. I understand running a place like this has challenges but no care was shown from beginning to end about the customer experience. Oh well except for the bus lady she was cool.... Maybe she should own the place? Winning!   And I'm out!

First, I'm only rating 1 star because they don't have a negative 5 trillion. The fact that they use " New York" in the title is a down right insult!! New Yorkers would spit on this pizza, actually it tastes like they did! I would serve this to some ny rats but I would be scared for their health!   Now for the specifics. Who do you think you are charging that much for a horrible eating experience! If you are going to charge 2 bux a topping it better not taste like bacon bits! We ordered wings and asked for extra crispy. They came burnt, over cooked and floating in oil! Just not edible!   The pizza crust is rubber and just strange tasting! The sauce is filled with sugar, and it was runny! Watery and not filled with goodness. Toppings were not fresh at all.   The location is ify,when you walk in its dark and filled with sadness. It took 5 mins at the counter for someone to even say hi   In closing I can not believe this place is still open let alone a chain that people keep pouring money into!   Seriously though I had better pizza at a gas station for 2 bux! You should be ashamed of yourself

Ohhhhh  I visited this establishment for a take out pizza experience. I did call a head. I walked in to an environment that was not well lit. I waited at the counter... No one was around. I waited some more... No one was around. Finally a kid comes out and asks what I need. I tell him, he gives me my order and then I pay and then I leave. The staff seems unfriendly and the establishment felt uninviting.   This is not pizza or any edible form of what any Italian would call pizza. No passion, no care, no zest for or importance placed on quality of ingredients.  Really? I cannot be the lone wolf that tastes how bad this is? Lack of quality.   I am sorry to be so harsh but it just gets annoying to see all of these business get away with mediocrity. Sometimes I feel like we need a champ. Someone to step up and fight for the little guy. Well here it is.... "Rocky music playing in the background"   Don't go. If you like pizza and respect yourself then do not go. Raise your hands high turn around and walk away.   Sorry, not sorry.   The Sarcastic Truth Villain.   P.S. Check the restaurant inspection report.

Great Scott! Holy sliders batman!   This place has it all. Sliders, dogs, fries, fried zucchini, chili, brat...   It's just delicious. The food becomes addictive so be careful. You will get cravings.   You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. I have been there a few times and it is always fast and friendly and hot and yummy!  They do get pretty busy but they are still always fast. I really can't say enough good things about this place.

Wow!  The staff was attentive and friendly. The server was excited to share his input and help make an informed decision. The food was unreal!!! We had green chile kettle with tortillas.. It was amazing!!! We tried the restaurant week menu and had oven roast shrimp and grits with bacon. So so good. My gf had half a rotisserie chicken with corn bread stuffing and I had almond crusted rainbow trout. We could not stop eating!! This place is a must visit!! Don't miss out. The prices are decent too because the quality of the food and service is so un-parrelled it is rare.  Loved it.

Worst food... Chicken lettuce wraps taste like rotten fish. Took one bit a spit it out! Even heard a kid at another table eating the same thing say, "mommy is there fish in this" dumplings were soggy and tasteless and the sauce had to much onion and oyster sauce. The vegetable chow mien is really just poorly made lo mien. Very runny sauce no flavor, did not taste fresh or properly prepared. To top it all off the bill was 24.50 an I gave her a 20 and a ten. She said "Ohh 50 cent an I do not have five maybe you just wait?" haha wait for what another table to leave? You are crazy!! I'm sticking to china chili...

This is the worst service. It cuts in and out all of the time. They change your speeds all of the time. They do not help or fix the problems unless you pay more money even though it is all on them. I pay 70 a month for inconsistent service. I have called dozens of times and have done everything asked of me. I bought a new modem, all new cables, and the best router money can buy. Cox service still doesn't work right. Also every night at 9pm it goes out... Not slows down but goes out. They say they don't know why. They can't send anyone to help either because techs stop working at 7. How convenient for them. So I'm stuck paying for bad service and no one cares. I can't wait for goole!!

I'm giving this a 1 star for a few reasons. -Food is not edible. They need to really take time to add natural and fresh ingredients to their food. It tastes and looks very processed like they purchase bulk items, overcook them then serve them. They pair food that does not at all go together. I have tasted food that costs as much as they charge and I would say that this place is not worth it for people that enjoy fresh well prepared food. It might be good for some people.. I guess.   The employees are very nice.  We were sent a survey and responded with honest specific feedback. The owner actually decided to not take the feedback or focus on the customer experience but rather decided to blame us for waiting until the survey to provide the feedback.   That was sad. I guess some people have a hard time seeing feedback as an opportunity to improve or "wow" a customer.  The other bad review made us worried before we went. We thought lets give this place a chance it was probably the customers fault. After trying this place we can very much see it was not the customer.. But just a serious lack of care an passion or even business acumen on the part of the establishment. Hopefully they do not see this as a negative post but as a chance to take feedback and change.

I heard about this place many times from many different people. It's a great idea to combine deli and restaurant this just doesn't seem to be executed very well.   The place is nice and comfortable. You can sit inside or outside. The staff is nice. You order at the counter and pay at the near by register. After paying they give you a number to place at your table so they can bring your meal.   So like I said, it's nice decor, it's cozy, and the employees are nice....  It's really just the food that's not good. We ordered  pasta fagioli to share and we each had a sandwich. My sandwich was eggplant parm.  First let me say the bread was pretty great!  The eggplant was stringy and mushy, and the sauce was so sweet it wasn't edible. They brought the sandwiches before the soup. I guess it's not that big of a deal but it would have been nice to have the pasta fagioli first. Well, that is what I said in my head before I tasted the bowl of beans and olive oil the brought us. This was not edible.   The sandwiches come with a side salad. One of our side salads had a hair in it. Not ours. Not edible.  The mozzarella cheese tasted home made but not good homemade. It was extra mushy and runny.   Oh I also ordered a slice of coconut cake. It looked amazing! All of the baked products looked amazing. I had to stand in line again to get the cake even though I had paid for it previously. The first bite... Sadness... Stale.. Hard crusty cake.   They gave me the money back for the cake but not for anything else. I didn't ask though. Oh well, you win some you lose some. It's never fun to leave a restaurant hungry.

This was our first Persian food experience... I have to say the food was amazing! Great hummus, the pita was done perfectly!! Nice and warm. We had the Cornish hen filet mignon special with rice and a Greek salad,,,, lots of food,,, I mean lots of food enough to feed 6, and it was yummy!!  The server Shawn was extra cool. He was stuck there all by him self and he did a great job multitasking,,, he was very polite and we would go back there just because of his excellent service!!! Thanks Shawn !!!   The only thing we would change is the decor, it looks like it used to be a sushi place,,, not very Persiany feeling.. That's the reason we gave it 4 stars..

My girlfriend and I have tried Luci's many times. Like dozens, because we live close by and it would be so cool to have this place be good. If you like good coffee skip it. A couple of time they sold us regular coffees and were actually out and we had to wait for them to brew more. One time we tried the baked goods and they tasted like they were sitting in that case for weeks! So nasty. Most recently we tried the breakfast we tried the buckwheat pancakes and were charged a dollar for 4 extra blueberries. I tried a cappuccino and the foam was so thick I had to scope it out into the garbage can. The first 4 times we went the staff was rude, un-attentive and very unorganized. The staff seemed to be nicer this time but still unorganized.   In the end, too expensive for such a sub par experience. Too bad so sad.

It takes a lot to impress me.... Like a lot a lot... No really. A lot. But Heidi nailed it!!!   From years of working in a high dollar customer service industry I have ... Hmmm how do I say... Maybe... Unrealistic expectations that everyone just understands how to treat a customer.,. Um I am a human just like you... Well sorta.   That being said----  I never really cared about my hair-- did the super cheap crapycuts thing forever. Until now... I realized I didn't care cuz crappycuts didn't care....    This place is perfect. I love the environment, fun and friendly staff. Its like a place i might actually chose to just go chill... It has a great sense of community, like it just belongs there.  Heidi is amazing. She always pays attention to detail and explains all of your options. (Ps.. Keep in mind they are your options, just like any other experience you chose to partake in,,be grown act grown..what!,)   You can see how much care and passion she has for the craft. The price list is on a chalk board (yea! thas cool) and wait they actually take the time to set expectations right upfront.   For me, it is always hard to find somewhere you feel comfortable let alone some one who does good work. Fun place...  This place truly has a good thing.. Customer service..check!  Talented and professional staff..check..! Awesome location..check! Free drink.. Check!  Done done and dizzzun!!  Jsnow out!

I love this place. Cupcakes should be sweet, moist and flavorful. That's what they are!! Normal sized and worth every penny. I wouldn't care if they sold them on a cart on the side of the road in the ghetto! So to me the place is fine and the lady is always nice, even if i have to wait a minute or two i understand. The cupcakes are filled and delicious. Anyways they are addictive! I tried to go one Monday and they were closed so I tried urban cookie and there is no comparison! Urban cookies tasted like something I tried to make when I was five but I messed up the recipe. This place is magic! And I'm glad I found it.

This place is perfect. It feels like community. Tracy is the best thing since sliced bread. Everyone that works here is so nice and welcoming.  Tracy is a miracle worker. Sort of like Miracle Max from the Princess Bride, only different. Ahhhhh I'm relaxed, rejuvenated, muscles don't hate me anymore. She got rid of all my brain pain.   I will never go anywhere else. I promise...  Peace Signed The Sarcastic Truth Villain.

Boom-Pop-Pow-Bam  Holy enchiladas Batman!   This is a nifty location, a funky idea, and yummy eats all thrown into a clay dish and roasted over a fire.   The menu is fun, great selection but controlled enough to do what they do exceptionally well. Menu-drawn in chalk, not a unique idea I know but boy does it just fit this place.   You walk to the counter... Kinda like chipotle. Pick your stuff, they cook it in the dish... In the fire.... Right in front of you.   I had a chicken burrito with green chili and a side of con bread.... Oh sorry I'm from the south... Corn bread.  Man it was good. Just a cool experience with a helpful staff and good food.   Nuff respect. You should try it at least once. Cuz cuz cuz I said so. What's the worst that could happen? I'm mean really.   An I'm out....s

Sad bagel.   You have all the potential to be my best friend. We are not best friends though because your never there when I need you, you are inconsistent in your advice and you take more then you give. I just, as a friend, do not feel like you really care.   The first few times I visited this place was great! Lots of accoutrements. The New Yorker was delicious! Cream cheese, tomato, onion, lox, capers all piled high on a fresh egg bagel! Yes please! Where do I sign!!!   Now, I'm not going to state credentials on being a master of bagels or an aficionado.   I will say that this place feels overpriced for what you are getting. I am speaking of quality of ingredients and care of composition not portion sizes.   Sometimes the bagels are stale, sometimes they are cut wrong and sometimes they are toasted wrong. Sometimes the capers are fresh, some times the lox is fresh. All this being said the opposite of all of those things are also "sometimes" true.   Sometimes I get that little thin slice, which is supposed to be the top half but it's not... I dislike that thing. The employees should pay more attention. If it comes out like that how about cutting another?   They stopped making egg bagels. Really that was the best part, the reason for going.   In closing, everything bagel doesn't have everything nor do they everything well all of the time. However, they do tell you everything you want to hear and then break your heart.   We had a good run. See you around kid.  P.s. Selling day old bagels is a great idea, but incase you didn't know day old bagels don't have mold on them. Good luck!   The Sarcastic Truth Villain.

The excitement of going to this place was way better then the experience of actually going.   The food was mediocre. Nothing to write home about. We had an appetizer and two entrees. The pasta was well made and well cooked.  The sauces had no flavor, everything was just bland.   The service was non existent. 10 mins to refill my water once. 20 mins to take our order, 25 mins to get the order, 20 mins before anyone checked on us, 20 mins before I had to go inside and pay. We were planning on getting coffee and desert but gosh the waiting was just intense.  It's like they were trying to write a suspenseful story but nothing ever happened.   Sitting waiting sitting waiting...   The atmosphere is confusing. Part chain restaurant and part sports bar. I can say that nothing about this place reminds me of great Italian cooking nor does it have enough of anything that warrants the insanely high prices.   It's sad when you are excited to try a place and you as a customer seem to care more about the experience then the establishment that over charges you.   I'm giving it two stars because of the homemade pasta. That is all... Caio.  P.s. I do not mind paying insane prices for an exceptional dinning experience.

Thank you, thank you..... Um........for proving my point.   Fusion places are a bad idea.... Add the fact that its a chain to that and wow = disaster.....  We had a party of thirteen. Great service, considering the size of the table, the server was awesome... Meaning nice, and attentive.  The food however, and I use the term "food" loosely, was horrible. Why do they feel the need to mix, Mexican, southwest, southern, and Chinese!!   Really what is that?  Can't you just do one thing amazing and not twenty things just mediocre?  Anyways...13 people and not a one finished their meal. Not a one had the same thing, not a one, took anything to go, and not a one liked what they ordered..... Ehhhhh   Food is just weird, prepared weird, looks weird and tastes like an expensive chili's  Okay, okay.... I am done. Sad but true, such a waste of an amazing local community location...... :-(   P.s. don't ever tell someone from the south that you serve the best cornbread in the country........well, unless its actually true. Okay thanks.

I was so excited!!! I just couldn't hide it!!!   Why you ask? Well, I was excited when I heard this location was opening. You see I live close by and geeezzz I loved the other locations. The other locations offered an amazing product with addictive flavors and unparalleled passion for detail and consistency.   Then my excitement faded. It has taken me a long time to write this review because I kept my hopes alive - time after time and try after try. After 15 or so attempts at this sterile location I finally throw In the towel... I quit all the things...   I accept my last stage of grief.   15 or so visits and not once has the flavor or experience been even sort of reminiscent of the original taco shops. Nothing tastes the same. Seriously, every time you go.  You can order the same thing and it tastes like a completely different place. Even the guacamole!!! Every thing is even made differently each time. Tortillas are filled different rolled fm different. It's just strange.  Isn't there a recipe?   You can feel the difference. No care or attention to detail.   It's like the had an authentic amazing grandma with great recipe and passion and fired her just to replace her with someone from Taco Bell.   And that is being nice because at least with the bell you know what it's gonna taste like. Not like I would eat there either but still.  Anyways. Sorry if this is harsh but by golly.., you had magic in a bottle and I'm disappointed that it seems like the bottle was packaged sold and then it forgot where it came from.   P.s. I gave it two star because it still hurts. I Love You!

I'm not sure where to start. So I'll start at the end. Disputed charges, 18 phone calls, refunded money, and two months of life wasted. All because they sold me a couch that was not made of the same material as the couch in the show room.  Seriously the foam inside was different used and dirty.  Technicians they send to your house don't even know what they are doing and they don't speak highly of their own company. No and I mean no customer service at all. They play games with you on the phone. They use super nice statements and happy tones to try to calm you down before your even upset. Then they state policies and try to get you off the phone ASAP. I guess this is why the stores don't have direct phone numbers.   Bottom line. This company only cares about money and not you!   This was the worst shopping and customer service experience of my life. The products are no good. Spend a few extra bux and go somewhere that sells quality. When making large purchases customer service and peace of mind is worth every penny.

It brings me joy. Oh wait that's the opening for a different review.... Ehem. (Clears throat)  It brings me great indifference.  "What does?" You may ask yourself.  This place. I swear I was kidnapped and transported right into a Polo catalogue. It's got a cool layout and the patio is nice with a pretty great view.  The yelp said it was $$ and the menu actually says it's $$$. Which is fine. Well, by fine I mean money is worth spending on goods and services that have an equal and fair market value. Half a butterflied chicken breast an two 4oz sides should not equal $18.   If you go here and you like artichokes. They have grilled ones. If you don't get them. You will feel like you are missing something.. Like how it feels when you lose your keys.  They were perfection on a plate. I would go back for these.   I ordered dessert. The menu said chocolate cake!! What! Who tha! Yes come to pappa.  When the cake was delivered it was shoved in a small mason jar thingy. Ok cool, be hip and innovative and all that but what happened to being amazing first, like pre innovation? Chocolate cake. Bake the thing and slice it, then put a slice on my plate. If you do simple amazing it doesn't seem so simple.   Overall the experience was a welcome one. Ohhhh wait. Let me back that thing up. So it was not busy, yet from the moment of inception till the moment of completion took almost two hours. 30 mins of that was spent waiting for the check.  Ehhhh to sum this up- "meh"  And I'm out!

If, when, how, the, what the!   Who the heck. (Dramatic pause)   Came up with this flavor driven tastebud amusement park for My belly!!!!   Any way you try it. Any thing you place on it.  Your not going to regret it. Well if you eat too many in one sitting you might .,, uh yea just trust me on that.   Great service. Friendly staff. Always smiling and working hard. They love to help you with fun pairings and recommendations!   They have all kinds of dogs.   (In slow mo)  they have Chicken dogs, Beef dogs, Pork dogs, Veggie dogs, Shriners dogs, boiled shrimp wait not that last one..     They use Naan bread instead of buns (freakn amazing). Picasso had a brush they got NAAN!!!   I've tried them all. Loved them all and lived to share my love with the world through means of verbal and social communication.   How dare you not go here... You should be ashamed... Bad doggie!   And I'm out!!!

Meeehhh. "Shrugs shoulders" I don't get it.   So follow me on this one.   You walk up to the door and someone opens it for you. That's nice right?  Well then you don't really know what to do next. There is a path in front of you, one to the left and one to the right. Hmmmm I didn't go out to eat to have to make these kinds of decisions. There is no hostess. So you keep walking straight. Then you see a big kitchen. Above the kitchen counter they have a big board which displays the menu. By default you stop moving forward and look. This causes a traffic jam and people behind you also become confused. Then we were asked to step to the counter. We do as instructed and the cashier asks what we would like. I say I have no idea this is all happening to fast. I have never been here and the choices are vast.  Anyways. We order and apparently you have to take a piece of paper with you to find a table that matches the number they write on the paper. I asked the guy where table 96 was and he had a hard time explaining it... That did nothing for my confidence, being the one who actually had to do the finding.   So.., then we find out we have a server. Oh but not a regular one. This server only brings your food and refills your ketchup. Also you have to get your own drinks at a fountain far from your table.   The fries were yummy that's the one star. The burgers were raw not medium well and we had them send them back multiple times until we gave up and went somewhere else. We didn't have to pay because apparently you do that after you eat instead of when your in line ordering??? So weird. I'm not a fan.   So take all of that and add to poorly cooked burgers and I shout a big no thanks to you kind sir.
