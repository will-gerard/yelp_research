What a great find and thanks to Yelp! its small, but food was good and just the right amount and at a great price. Will definitely be heading here again even if its out of my way for breakfast. They have lunch and dinner too, menu looks good, so I'll have to try them for lunch and dinner too.

Was dissapointed in this last job and wasn't so impressed the first time, so my fault for going back. First, if I am paying $18 to have a simple hem done on pants, I would hope that would include them pressing the pants. Second, when I put the pants on, I am positive they didn't even hem them. I will not be taking them back for them to charge me $18 again, and will probably be doing the hem myself.

Today was my first time getting my hair cut here. I was a little shocked when I went to pay ($70), but that was my fault for not asking when I called. I was in need of a haircut as my 3pm appointment today fell though and I am not going back (see my horrible review for Tony & Guy). I was able to call and get in with-in two hours. I don't expect this all the time, I just got lucky due to the Memorial Holiday. Rene was great. I wanted to change my style, she walked me though the grow out process and what we would do. It was great. $70 was more than I wanted to pay, but the service compared to the last place I went made it worth it.   I will mostly likely be going back to her regardless of the cost. I would have given it 5 stars, but the price was a little steep. Yeah, I know, its Scottsdale, but still...

I had a completely different experience than that last review. I had a massage here last night, first time coming to this place. She did a great job. I came in with a knot in the middle of my back and a little of a stiff neck. She was very good, paid attention to my back and the knot which is what I asked her to do. When she got to my neck, she said the soreness was coming from my jaw not my back. She really seemed to know what she was doing and 50 minutes was NOT enough! I will be going back!

After searching the web, I settled on Camelback Moving. Called about two weeks ahead for a saturday move. My move was scheduled for noon and they called about 10:15am asking to come early as they had already finished their earlier job. I was not ready, so they got lunch and arrived around 11:15am. My move took about 4 hours which was more than I expected, however, I was moving from a 3 story townhome so I guess acceptable. Jake and Chris helped me out, showed up with a 24 foot truck and did a very good job. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a moving company. They even asked at the end about helping to move anything additional.
