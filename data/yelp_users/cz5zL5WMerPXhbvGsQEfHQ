This is the best place to have a foot canal. Nice office with very pleasant staff members. Dr Carlson took very good care of me when I was in pain. Dr Hales also took care of my daughter a few years ago. Very caring and modern office.

I have always had the best service here. We drive from Gilbert and have for 18 yrs. they have done all types of services on our animals. Eat clip on my boxer. Eat infections. Spay neuter c section for our  boxer. I can't tell you how well they have taken care of our dogs and cats through the years. I pass a lot of vets to see them. They are caring and compassionate from birth to crossing the rainbow bridge. Thank you for caring for our pets.

Like the third time I've been here and they are out of croissants. It's ten am. Last time I got the last ones. Kind of disappointing that you drive over and they are always sold out.

Dr carter helped me and he really was not very helpful. He kept saying I had a burn when I had been bitten by something. He gave me an antibiotic and a couple of pain pills that did nothing for the pain  I went to see him because of the excruciating pain and was left suffering for another week. Probably should have seen someone else but didn't really care to and hoped for the best. Finally pain subsided after 9 days.

The worst waits ever. Wait to check in then wait for them to help you then wait some more. Even wait when you buy thousand dollar phones. Not a fan of the waits and the 50/50 chance they can solve your issue.

The worst experience ever getting a passport. The shrew who does them at this location is miserable. We waited for hours to be told come back tomorrow. We got there the next day an hour early and finally were able to be seen after two hours waiting. She wouldn't do out passports even though we had documentation asked for on web site. Uncooperative agent who is just miserable. I finally ended up going to courthouse and had a quick pleasurable experience. Do not go here . Go to courthouse. You will not regret it.

Wow. The slowest fast food ever. Waited 40 minutes for food.When we get to the window she hands me our ice cream and we wait at the window for like 12 more minutes as the  Ice cream is melting.  Total wait for 2 burgers and fires and ice cream 45 minutes. Ice cream is totaLLY melted. Not sure how long it sat before we got to window. And price is ridiculous for OK burgers.

I have never had a facial that lasted twenty something minutes. The technician was competant but the experience was poor. Cold brightly lit room. When we went to treatment room she said I could put on robe but I didnt need to. I opted not to since it was chilly in the room and my expectations were pretty low from what I was experiencing. I did not see a blanket on the table. Facialist was pretty good with technique but while steaming she did not offer to do hands, etc she just sat there looking at something. She did not include neck area in facial which I have never not had done before-strictly face. She told me we can do galvanic next time but never explained what it was or anything.  I did purchase a groupon-you almost get what you pay for which is too bad since the location is great for me but the level of service was poor. I did notice they gave me the "price " $125 to base my tip on. I have had facials all over the world and never paid 125 for 27 min. Boulders Spa here in Carefree is expensive and their facials were cheaper than that and that was quite the experience. Overall disappointed with what I got since they should actually provide service they would normally give but the obviously prefer to offer mini facial and say it is full service which it was not. I have to say skin felt nice after mini treatment and tech was competant just not really a wow service. I am left wondering if I pay full price will I get more but not really wanting to take the risk. As a business owner they are probably running more people off with the groupon and not getting new clients.

In the past 2Drops did not get a 5 star from me, however they do now.  I gave them another chance because of their location and was pleasantly surprised. The service is so much better than previously. I had an excellent facial and also brought my daughter in for a facial. The ease of making the appointments was better than before when they had long wait time to get in due to groupons. The astheticians were great.  I would recommend them highly at this time.

Do not come to urgent care extra. They just send you elsewhere. They don't have a dr available. We were seen last night the pay was nice but she did not know how to diagnose a broken bone that was clearly broken on the X-ray. She told us my son had a bruise and gave him a sling. When I looked at X-ray you could see it is broken. She gave me a number for follow up and they were unable to see him. I got in with another dr this morning and they will not accept the X-ray taken last night. So you will pay twice as your insurance will not cover the same thing twice. Pretty much the same thing happened last time I went to urgent care with my daughter but the next dr used the X-ray they took. These places are a scam to take your money and not do anything for you. Stay away. I will be going back to ask for a refund and for them to not submit to my insurance as their services need to be repeated. Ironically I asked if they could treat his bone if it was broken and they said yes. They lied. They did not know if I could just pay cash they are only concerned with how they can milk your insurance for payments and the. They balance bill you as they take your credit card.

I am giving them one star because they got me in with my son who had a broken clavicle. I was able to be seen by Kelly Connor the PA. When we arrived with the X-ray from urgent care the told me they needed their own xrays and they would need to retake it. So much for limiting radiation on a young patient. We were seen by Kelly the PA who was somewhat condescending to me and my son. He was in a lot of pain and they confirmed he had a fracture in the collar bone. I told her he cried all night and I was wondering if she could give him something for pain. She told me they do not give pain medication to children. I told her agin how the Motrin alternating with Tylenol was not helping and she told me I would be in for a few sleepless nights. I did not think that children could not be prescribed pain medication so I went to pharmacy to ask if that was true. The pharmacist assured me children are given pain meds all the time. I had to call my pediatrician to get something for my sons pain. I think that Kelly Connor was unprofessional to allow my son to suffer. She never told me to call my pediatrician to get a medication to alleviate my sons pain. She told me to allow him to be uncomfortable and that no one gives pain meds to children anymore. Had I believed her my little boy would have continued to suffer. I wonder how many other kids seen by her have suffered unnecessary pain. I would advise against seeing Kelly Connor. As she is a heartless provider. The office staff were friendly enough though.

I come here all the time but never look at front of car to realize it is still dirty   Did bug wash today to get car actually clean and looked after the wash and it was really still dirty. Went to josh and he got me to run it through again. Guy that sprays car didn't really bother to spray front second time either even though josh told him and so did I. Car was still dirty the second time. Josh said sorry. Since I was my car 2 or 3 times a week it really is never that dirty. I will stick with detailed that comes to my office and does inside and out for 20 bucks. Disappointed.

Yo waffle has waffles and frozen yogurt. I was disappointed the waffles are made and sitting under a light. I would prefer to have them made to order like waffle luv. To be honest I did not even get a waffle when we went since it looked like it was sitting there for a while. Frozen yogurt was good and they offered several favors. I got salted Carmel. Kids liked theirs as well. Just wish waffles were made for you. Yo waffle responded to me and let me know they will make the waffle fresh so I look forward to trying one.

I broke my tooth and it was over the holidays and Dr Call came in after hours to take it out and put in an implant. I am super scared of the dentist and he was great. He is very gentle and I didn't feel a thing. I am so happy to have found such a good caring honest dentist.
