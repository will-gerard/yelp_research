Best salon in town. Hands down. Christopher has transformed my whole family!  My girls look amazing and he gives the best men's cut I've ever had! Worth every penny!  Great atmosphere and wonderful staff!

I took my partner to Firesky to celebrate his birthday.  I had some unusual requests and they were accommodated WAY beyond my expectation, and our whole stay was perfect from check in to check out!  I travel a lot for work and have stayed in some of the finest resorts in the country and I have never received service as good as we got here.   The room was perfect. The staff was incredible. The property was gorgeous!  I will definitely come back again and again!

Seems like a great deal. And it is if you're ok to wait in lines. We went to Flamingo first... Got in quick but the food was not very good AT ALL. Unsatisfied, we thought we'd go give Planet Hollywood a shot. Waited in line for about an hour and a half then thought we were in, to go down the escalator to find another LONG line.  We left. For dinner we went to Rio. One of the best buffets in Vegas. They shut the line down literally as we walked up. Said there was an hour wait and they close at 10. It was 9:00. The line disappeared in about 15 min. At that point, it was to late to find another and get on by closing time, so we ended up finding somewhere else to eat. We will have breakfast in the morning. Probably at the the Rio, so $114 for 2 of us. 1 bad buffet and hopefully 1 breakfast. The line at all the strip buffets is at least an hour in line. Total rip off.

A little off putting at first, look, location, etc.  The staff was VERY friendly, and there were overall good reviews, so we gave it a shot.  Ordered the spring rolls... not so good.  We also ordered Panang and Yellow curry.  By far the best yellow curry I've ever had.  The panang was awesome too!  The owner replaced our spring rolls for egg rolls.  Great service.  Mango sticky rice was great!  Price was very reasonable.  I'd definitely go back again!

There are few words to describe Jane!!  She has truly saved my family on more than one occasion!  After a rough divorce, she helped 3 of my kids navigate their way through, and helped us all learn some amazing communication skills!  They LOVE her!  Then a few years later, when I was in need of some couples work, Jane once again helped us learn, see, and understand each other in ways we couldn't.  I owe her SO much!  She is VERY easy to talk to, an incredibly down to earth woman, and deeply passionate about helping people be better people!  I have referred many friends and clients to Jane, and each one has loved her as much as I do!  I could go on and on... let me just finish by saying, that if you are experiencing challenges in life, Jane is the one to help you navigate through them!
