Washing my hands with this dealer. Went to buy my second vehicle from them and wasn't feeling like I was getting a loyal customer deal. I was right. I went to the next closest Chevy dealer and was offered $2500 more trade in than the dealer I bought it from originally. Plus, I was quoted $2900 less for the EXACT same make and model vehicle I wanted and purchased. That's almost $6k. No Freeway I don't need tint, nitrogen or sealant at your ridiculous inflated price. I'm giving you 2 stars because your service department is good the couple times I used it. Too bad the sales department can't learn from the crew that actually WORKS for your money rather than work to TAKE your money!  Note to the public, go to a dealership that is owned by shareholders.

I've been to Pho Cao many times and have always enjoyed my experience! My girlfriend and I love the PHO and Saki Bombers! I'm kind of new to Yelp and don't usually leave reviews unless it deserving and Pho Cao is as good as it gets if your looking for Vietnamese food that is priced right!
