I love this store!  very underwhelming, which i love being able to get in/ get out... their produce prices, and chili prices are amazing!  The staff is funny and awesome.  the music makes me dance in the isles LOL.  literally.   they also give you free marinade with any meat purchase which is way cool. I don't like their prices on bread, cake mixes, and things like that, but their produce more than makes up for that, prices are awesome, and its absolutely fabulous and fresh. Ronney

if I could give this place -10 i would...  here is the deal... we live not far from here, so me first, went a few years ago, so this isn't want this is about.  husband went about a year ago.  he injured himself.  gave him an Rx for advil and was sent on his way.  (Turns out, he actually had a torn muscle, and needed extensive PT and was in so much pain, etc...)  This morning is when it all comes to a head...  my daughter had this "pimple' on her chin that felt like someone punched her in the jaw she said.  So i looked at it, thought it might be an ingrown hair so i did 'surgery' on it... for lack of a better phrase.  used tweezers, a sanitized stick pin and got the 'ingrown hair" out (although did not find a hair)...    So my daughter wakes up this morning, her whole chin is swollen.  She is a Navy Veteran, served in war and everything.  She is NOT a complainer.   The doc came in and didn't even look at her for more than 2 minutes.  It was a female doc and didn't introduce herself.  Did not put gloves on and examine it, just basically looked at her, and gave her an Rx for antibiotics told her to not squeeze it and said that if it wasn't better in a couple of days to go to the E.R..  Say whaa??    as the day goes on, my daughters face becomes more and more swollen.  More and more red, just doesn't look right....   i said, "honey, I need to look at that"  i barely put any pressure on that, and a bunch of green puss (yes tmi) comes out.  it did not take much pressure for me to get a bunch of infection out.   i contacted a friend who is a PAC...  She said I did the right thing and that daughter needs to see a doc soon and keep taking the antibitoics.  So that is what we are doing, she is making an appointment at the VA and will continue to take the antibiotics as prescribed.  This actually looks like some sort of bite!  i am outraged at this place for not inspecting this further!  This young woman is NOT a complainer, and deserved an exam.  i mean I just barely touched it and stuff came oozing out!  wtf is that?  shouldn't the DOCTOR have done that?    so after my experience, my husbands experience, and no my daughters experience...  we will drive further to get quality care!    STAY AWAY FROM HERE!  Scottsdale Osborn is not too much further, and there is another urgent care up the street about 52nd st and Thomas Rd.  please, do not waste your time and money.

woohoo!   We always go here on Tuesdays, and sometimes on weekends.  their food is so good.  The burgers are the best in town!  And if you like wings, try their honey hots... grilled (they are not on the menu but they will make them and they are so good)  The staff is awesome, their drinks are great.   I love how they have 2 bathrooms for such a small place.  Always have music going (unless a game is on) and if the game you want to watch isn't on, they will turn it on if you ask them, and gladly do so.  We love Mandy and Brandy, And other poster is right about them greeting strangers as regulars (as we were strangers once).     on the weekends its 5-5-5  which means 5 dollar pitchers, 5 dollar wings, and 5 dollar burger and fries:)  yummie!  love it there!  Thanks Drummer!  Ronney

wow! I gotta say I am surprised at the reviews when I read them.  I went to I Do I Do (first stop in my wedding dress shopping).  Heather was my consultant.  She was amazing.  She didn't mind that I tried on dresses that I knew I probably wouldn't like, but had to try them on anyhow "just to make sure"  She said that is a good idea because what you think you don't like, you may be surprised.    So I tried on this dress "I didn't like"  (i told her to pick something if I came in here and had no idea what i wanted, I totally was like, 'no effin way') And now its a very top contender!   I LOVE this dress, its like she knew me, or at least what would look good on my body type. I haven't made a decision yet as I am beginning VERY early looking for a dress because I do not want to be stressed out as I'm trying to do everything else.  There is one dress that is my "DREAM" dress and Heather said they ordered it and should have it within a couple of months.  (which is good since I am having major surgery and will need recovery time, another reason I am doing so many things now).  Heather knew I wasn't going to purchase that day, I told her flat out, but I feel she didn't treat me any differently than if I had a million dollars to spend.    My only complaint is that they do not allow pictures.  Right now I am trying to decide between 4 dresses... one is one from I do I do.   But I have no pictures of me in the dress to compare it to the other 3 (davids bridal and group usa)    Other than that I had a great experience.  I do not know who your consultants were.  I just say request Heather.  She was bubbly and upbeat.  She somehow made a size 16 dress fit on my body in a way that I could tell what it looked like.  I have a tattoo I want to cover during the ceremony and was concerned about it, she took the time to explain that we can add straps and showed me the different kinds of straps. it was just nice.  (no i do NOT know her, I am not a friend of hers, and have no affiliation with her outside of this experience, I got her card and that is how I remembered her name)  I plan on going back to try on my dream dress and others, she told me that it would be okay a lot of people take a while to decide:)   I still don't even know if I will buy a dress from there or not, but we will see...  Anyhow...  I am sorry you all had the experiences you did (like I had with Azteca Bridal Plaza, seriously do NOT go there, you can get better service at Goodwill)    Ronney

VERY VERY Long Post, I am like ... LIVID, ANGRY, SAD, SHOCKED, AWED, AMAZED, BOTHERED  take your pick:)   I am amazed that they are still in business.  Like how can a place with this kind of HORRIBLE  customer service still be in business....  ZERO ZERO ZERO STARS!!!! ZERO... NONE NADA... IF I HAVE TO MAKE ME GIVE A STAR I WILL AT THE END OF THIS POST! BUT NO STARS IN FACT... I GIVE THEM -(thats minus)100 STARS!   Let me preface by saying this, I am a plus size bride, a 16 - 20 depending on the cut/shape/etc, I am friendly and things do not bother me life is what it is, and so it is, this is my philosophy on life....   I had been to a couple other stores and was treated well.  Okay, so now it comes to todays Fiasco!  Oh good Gawd!  seriously...  i should be pouring a glass of wine first LOL  Let me start at the beginning... the phone call yesterday.  Called to make the appointment, the guy on the phone asked alot of questions (so I, like the other poster, had high hopes that this was going to be a positive experience)  I explained that I was a plus size bride about an 18 and I asked if there was dresses that I would be able to try on.  He assured me that "they had plenty of them".  I was very happy and excited to go here, they have been in business for years so I thought they must be good.  I showed up, was there about minutes before a guy (not sure if he was the owner, the guy i spoke to on the phone or what) said can I help you.  There was no one in the store, NONE, no one, so why it took about 10 minutes I don't know, but it did.  Then he calls bridal down stairs.  This little woman walks down... I was still standing there, she said NOTHING to me.   After a few minutes I asked if she was from bridal, she said "yes" and to come upstairs  (no introduction).    I showed her some pictures (she took the pics and never gave back) of what I was looking for.  She basically pointed to the dresses that were my siz(ish) and said here are your sizes (she barely spoke english).   I pulled some dresses.    She took me to a room? (yea if curtains hanging on shower rods makes a room,then yea, i guess it was  room), I had to ask her for a bustier,  She asked what size, i told her, she STILL brought the wrong one. Then after I was ready, I'm like "okay I'm ready"  She hands me a dress! I told her i needed help with the bustier, she hooked it finally but not tight enough, so whatever... I made do by this point, I knew my experience should have ended.  I had had enough, but it is what it is, and maybe its my perception, so keep going with the flow...  Tried the first dress on, or tried to, I had no volunteered help from her.  this dress was obviously too small, but she was trying to get my to buy it, saying how beautiful it looked...  uh, no!  it didn't.  it didn't fit (too small), and the style was wrong.  so onto the next dress... again, it didn't fi (too small)t, and she told me how beautiful it was and even got one of those little veils to prove it.  Now comes the last dress.  WAYYYYYY too big, she wouldn't even put the clamps in the back so I could see what it looked like, and AGAIN she was telling me it was beautiful and i should buy it.  Give me an effin break...    I decided maybe something in bridesmaid since I wasn't looking for anything formal.  So same experience.  BUT... and get this, not making this up... LOL, now its funny...  NOT.  I grabbed some dresses.  I went into a shower stall again, and she said "i'm going to lunch, she will help you, and pointed to the seamstress"    Thats it, I walked out....  No one said good bye, have a nice day, kiss my a$$ or anything!  Their lack of customer service is rather disturbing.  I do not understand.  I am wondering though if they are prejudice against white people?  I know that sounds bad, but I do not know how else to explain my experience.  I was dressed nicely, Clean, and no other store had treated me so horribly....  What do you all think?   Could this be the case?  I know they probably have alot of hispanic clientel(sp) and I just can't figure it out...  I didn't want to end the day upset, so I called Davids Bridal on Ray Rd and they said I could come in:)  I did, and may have found the dress...that has yet to be determined.    DO NOT GO HERE!!!!  Ronney

when i first moved to AJ i started going here...  I now live in Phoenix and STILL make the trek out there to see Dan Finney PAC.  He is attentive and open with his feedback.  He listens and i just have nothing bad to say.  I have had to see a couple of the others over the years, and have never had a bad experience...  another plus...  in and out, very quickly, not a long wait time!  Ronney

EXCELLENT PLUS SIZE COLLECTION!!!!!!!!!!!  Had a great experience here!  Holly was awesome, she was very patient even though she knew I was not buying a dress that day.  I think I found my dress there! it is probably the ONE!  the one for the cruise and my 20th anniversary.  I am happy.  I did not expect to get this kind of service in this kind of shop so I was very pleasantly surprised.  the prices are good, and the variety is awesome!  I recommend it.  If you are looking to be completely catered to, this is not for you.  But if you are on a budget and looking for a great dress, and decent service, this is for you.  GREAT PLUS SIZE SELECTION!!!!    good luck! Ronney

yum!  I love their food,  their lunch buffet does not taste like buffet food.  The tables are kind of "sticky" but its the finish on them, and if htey would just put like a coat or 2 of polyeurothane on it, that would make the difference in the world.  But the food was really excellent.  Service was good, which is always the #1 priority in my book.  So over all a pleasant experience.  That creamy chicken stuff was soooo good (sorry dont remember what it was called) and I had this other kind of chicken stir fry stuff that was REALLY super excellent, It was called "pan something"  The pork dish was good too, it had greenbeans in it, and their veggies are cooked just right!  Really good and worth a trip!  YUMMIE!

I won't be back.  My son needed to get Vaccines for school.  So I made an appointment for here, as it is close to home and they could get me in quick.  I also had him do a physical, which is good.  The doctor was very good with him, my son has Aspergers (ASD) and the Doctor that saw him was very particular in his words, and he really understood my son, So this is not a reflection of Dr. V.  I am giving this a one star because...  When I walked in, the lobby was EXTREMELY small, clean, but small.  Then I realized why, This Doctor office shares a lobby with a WIC office and a Lab that takes walk ins.  We had a 3:15 appointment, didn't get home until between 5:30, and 5:45.  So my son and i walk up to the counter sign in, wait to be called.  They see everyone there from newborn on up.  So it was a very chaotic lobby and LOUD!...  its a cold lobby.   So we got there at 2:45 (as suggested for new patience) I signed in for our 3:15 appointment.  I finally get called up to fill out paperwork, they give me Spanish paperwork to fill out, I had to ask the woman at the front for English instructions.   She says something, and I say, I'm sorry, what?  She barely speaks above a whisper and this lobby is LOUD!  being so small, no carpet, cold furniture, etc...  So finally after a couple of exchanges, I realize she wants my insurance card.  I give it to her.    So I sit down and finish my paperwork.  I realize, there nothing on there asking about the health of anyone.  it was all about insurance and payment.  I thought to myself 'that's odd, every doctor i have ever been to always has something there about medical history...  but here... nothing -  wow, they care!    So I turn in my paper work and sit back down.  We don't get called back until about 3:30  (remember, my appt was 3:15)  so, they take my sons vitals, normal enough, but then we had to go sit back in the lobby...  Where we now wait until 4:00 when they call us back.  Well, the doc must be just about ready for us.  I wish...  The doc comes in at about 4:45, where then he goes over medical history etc..  Get a physical, needed vaccines, and seems to try to upsell me on 2 other vaccines that he doesn't need (chicken pox, which he already had, HPV which he doesn't need at this time, and another one)  When I denied them, he tried to talk me out of it, but I stood my ground.  So the doc does the physical, and the MA comes in and give's my son his vaccines.  Then someone else comes in to give me a piece of paper saying the vaccines he received so he can get back into school.  Finally after all that was done, it was about 5:20.  We leave the room, and the place is kind of confusing, so I am just walking around trying to figure out the exit and no one takes it upon themselves to ask me if I need help, so finally  I had to ask someone and (what seemed like bothering them) where the exit is, once we finally found the exit we were able to leave and then we went home.  So i got home about 5:30-5:45.    So i am looking at the paper as my husband asked "what shots did 'j' get?"  I take out the paper and tell him, he got this, that and the other...  THEN... the thing of ALL THINGS!!!!...  seriously, I can't believe this.  They scheduled us another appointment WITHOUT EVEN ASKING!!!!  yes I am serious.  That is gutsy.  Good news is, my son got his needed vaccines, and he can go to school now.  However the doc and the MA was really good.  The check out girl was super nice.  But this place is just one giant factory, that seems to put money above everything else.    pro: The doc seemed to get my son, which can be difficult at times  con: I didn't appreciate the 'upselling' of unnecessary vaccines (for the moment).  I don't appreciate them scheduling another appointment without my consent, and the LONG wait time, 2.5 hours in a doctors office is just rude!   All in All I just feel like they didn't respect my time, didn't really care about my sons health all that much.  And why do they have such a small lobby with sharing it with WIC and a Lab?

Dr Fucci is an amazing Dr.  He has a way of putting things in simple terms so that us regular people can understand it.  He has a great sense of humor and is personable.   I have had balance issues for the past 10 years or so. I lost hearing in my left ear.  I spoke with my PAC about it and he referred me to Dr Fucci.   I had to wait 3 months to get into see him, but it was worth the wait.  I have called the office with questions, and the medical Assistant Jessica always returned my call (when I had to leave her a VM) that very same day.   All the staff is friendly and the office is awesome.    I am having my labrynthectomy tomorrow in my left ear. and couldn't be more excited!    Thanks Dr Fucci!

Generally, I am NOT a breakfast person, but I LOVE this place.    Pros:  Good Service, seating quickly, good time,  always taken care of .  They definitely do know the meaning of Customer Service! Always greeted right away, not too long of a wait, etc...  Cons:  my husband is not a fan of the biscuits here.  He thinks that they are more like dinner rolls than biscuits.  The juice leaves a weird after taste in my mouth, I don't know what that is, it's almost kind of 'soapy'   The chicken fried steak is better than good!

First of all, if you go here, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check your bill when it comes!  honestly.  We went here 3 times.  all 3 times we were over charged....  either the menu's were out of date, or we were "past happy hour time" (BS)... oh and the other excuse... we just changed our menu.  blah blah blah  P  then they always have to "get a manager" to come to the table, which takes forever!  (I am sure they hope we leave)  PLUS! THE SERVICE SUCKS ASS!!!!  this is a definitely bait and switch!  1st time it happened we just dealt with it, and was like, whatever...  2nd time it happened, my daughter who just got back from deployment (Navy) wanted to do something special for us and took us all there.  My husband looked at the check and noticed it wasy CRAZY over what we thought as we were there for happy hour.  The waitress had to get the manager which took over 20 minutes, (gimme a break)  finally we took a 30 dollar gift card because we were so sick of 'arguing about it.  We discussed it about 20 minutes and we were finally like, whatever...  3rd time...  took a friend there.  again we ordered devils ale.  on the menu it was listed at one price... when we got the bill, it was almost twice as much.  We waited for our server to come back, she never did, she totally ignored us.  I gave her a dollar tip (which is NOT like me, i tip very well, too well)  and I wrote on the recept why she got such little money as a tip.    If you are looking for a fun time go caddy corner to San Filepe's  that place is fun and the staff are friendly and fun.  We much prefer there, we wll never go to Caddilac Ranch again.  They say 3rd time is a charm, Well, it is... its a charm to know you are overspending and its a big gimmick and they dont give a crap!  oh and if i didn't have to give a star, i wouldn't have.

Yum...  Great Service, Great Food, and they took my "special order well.   My special order was this: The Tuscan Chicken Salad. YUM... but it came with mushrooms and Gorgonzola, I am not a fan of either, so i substituted Feta for Gorgonzola and omitted the mushrooms.  The portion was just right, I ate about 3/4 of it and took 1/4 of it home.  So it wasn't over done.  I have nothing bad to say about this.    this was the most fantastic salad I ever had in my life.    The wine list was fantastic.  Definitely a must go!  Ronney

I was so excited to find this store and made an appointment today.  Tried on tons of dresses that fit.  I still have no direction on where I want to go for on my perfect dress (its for my 20th anniversary vow renewal) but Ann assured me this is normal, so now I don't feel like all hope is lost.  She is aware I will be making multiple trips.  I am glad I can try on any dress I want, and it was a great experience.  Can't wait until I finally pick a dress...  it will certainly be from here.

picked a dress.  ANN... YOU ARE AMAZING!!!  thanks for being awesome!  the patience of a saint.  Seriously, if you a curvy girl, and you do not visit here, you are doing yourself a diservice.  AND... if you think their prices are out of range, they are NOT...  They are right on par with Davids Bridal, but are much better quality AND much more original gowns/dresses.    I am so thankful to have found this place.

I really enjoyed this store and the prices of the store!  I actually put a down payment on a gown, and then got Cold Feet, and let it go.  But looking back on the photos, i made the right choice.  There was no pressure to buy, they just wont hold a dress to give me time to think about it, so if I wanted the dress, I HAD to put some money down on the dress to think about it.   The plus size section was not very big, but was okay.  I felt important even though the consultant (I think her name was Sue) was helping 2 of us at once.  The dressing area is huge, they do allow photos.  yay!  that is very important to me now, after being to a few salons that do not allow photos.    This place is over all great on selection and budget.  The ONLY downside was it was kind of hard to find in the complex so I am telling you right away....  Park near the sign, then walk down the outside hallway, its on the south side and that is where the store entrance is.  I first went on the outside of the building and walked all the way around and couldn't find it.  That is the only fault I can say about it.  Other than that, I had a really great experience, especially for just walking in without an appointment.   I just happened to be in the area and stopped by.

The sushi was great!!  We have nothing bad to say about it...  However, the service, TERRIBLE.    About 30 seconds go by When she asked if we knew what we wanted.  Got pissy When we said no.  But we did order sodas and crab puffs.  When she brought us our drinks, she slammed them down, so hard, people turned and looked.  Didn't come back for probably 15-20 minutes later we are waiting on them, she comes back and takes our order.  I order a corona,  she brings it back, slams it, and an on the rocks glass next to my husband and diagnal from me...  Not to me....  She still has no smile, and never did.    The Rangoon was brought with the rolls.  Not as an appetizer.  She keeps coming back every 5 minutes to try and get us to close out the tab.  I couldn't eat fast enough to get out of there.    If you are ok with good food and the most non friendly service ever, then this place is for you.  However, Service is very important to me, so for this reason only...  We will never go back.

WOW!!!  so I was trying to find a bar near where I live and lo and behold, this pops up!  Hubbie and I went there tonight.  The guy behind the counter (gonna assume its the owner)  was awesomely friendly and the beer? fantastic!!!   Camelback IPA:  Not quite as bitter as other IPAs.  It has kind of a citrusy undertone to it.  Its quite good. Watermelon Ale:  Was good.  Reminded me of a hard cider.  Very Light and refreshing.  My Favorite!   Freitz nonfiltered ale:  very good.  Prices are super great for the quality.  Go on in and support local businesses, and especially support local breweries!!! (and beer)    They do not have food, which is okay because they let food trucks park there.  The food truck tonight was good;)  Cajun Food:) yummie.
