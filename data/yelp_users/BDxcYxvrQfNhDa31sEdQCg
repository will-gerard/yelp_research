I've ordered here from twice for lunch being both of my boss' are huge fans! The soynami (vegan version of a blizzard) is absolutely amazing! It ruined my life becuase I think I may be addicted. I got it with the crunch (vegan version of butterfinger) and chocolate chips. Sooooo good!  The last time I order the spicy peanut tofu sald. It was definitely yummy but could stand for a bit more veggies in the salad itself.  This should be a national landmark for vegans!

I hosted a small baby shower brunch in their downstairs room. Everything was perfect. I made arrangements with Tony who was super professional and accommodating. Every staff member from the host to our server and bartender was friendly and helpful. The food was amazing and the atmosphere perfection. This restaurant is a small gem of Phoenix and I can't wait to go back!

First let me say, I would give Dr Pottgen 50 stars if I could. She was always amazing with my twins. She was super attentive, listened to my concerns and communicated clearly.   However, my issue is with their billing and insurance. They charged me for every well visit when my twins were born although my insurance covered it at 100%. It took them months to catch on, so by this time I had shelled out $50 for every appointment. They owed me over $200. BUT rather than giving me MY MONEY back they said they would put a credit on my account. I didn't have time to argue with this and let it go. However, every time I came in for a well visit they would ask me for my co-pay?!?!? I repeatedly had to go back and forth with them. After my children's one year check up, I had had it with the billing banter. I requested a complete print out of my account credit and visits from billing to be mailed to me so I could request a check and be done with it. I never received it. I called their billing office requesting the paperwork again never received. NEXT I called and spoke with Maria (I believe) and officially met the RUDEST MOST IGNORANT PERSON TO EVER EXISIT. She argued with me about everything. She cut me off. Would not let me finish my explanation. Jumped in every chance she could get to be accusatory. Said I owed them money. The things that came out of her mouth would flabbergast anyone. After over an hour of conversation she was set to mail me my billing information for the past year along with my account credit. She promised it within two weeks. Guess What? I never received it. I called again and had the same battle. I asked for her manager. She transferred me to a generic voicemail where I left a detailed message and never heard back. I went online and used their automated system requesting a call from a manager. GUESS WHAT? I never heard from anyone. Finally, I simply walked away from the office and MY EXISISTING CREDIT and never looked back.   It's a shame because their doctors are five star, their billing staff.... so below par it's ridiculous.

We were recommended to Cranial Tech by my pediatrician. As a new mom of twins I was extremely nervous and apprehensive. Upon my first visit the staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. At the first consultation they took pictures using a stocking cap with an open area for my son's face. They reviewed the photos with us in detail and gave us plenty of information to read later. We were made aware that it could be a cost to us as many insurance companies do not cover it.  When we decided to move forward, the billing staff was in constant contact and moved very fast in submitting paperwork to our insurance company. To our surprise it was covered in full by our insurance. This was an absolute relief.  We had weekly visits to their office being my son was so young. I could not be happier with their technicians. Theresa was always smiling and so gentle and friendly with my son. He smiled and laughed joyfully every time he saw her. We continued the treatment for 9 weeks and saw such an improvement. My son's head looks perfectly round and symmetrical. We even see an improvement with the placement if his facial features. He has officially graduated today!  I would recommend their office to anyone!  As a side note, we used the Wrap Shoppe in North Phoenix to decorate the DOC band. They do this for free and are amazing! (They do take breakfast and lunch donations. )

Called ahead to check price on international shipping. After quote I headed in and dealt with Andrew. He was unable to process the shipment stating it was not allowed to be sent to the country. I was shipping paper. He said there was a glitch in the system but refused to get on the phone with anyone or call his manager. He told me to go to UPS. I went to the fed ex on power rd in Mesa and they shipped it just fine. Incompetent. No customer service. Complete waste of time.

The best customer service. I had some issues with a special order and Kim the manager took special care and solved my problem. Employees are always friendly. I've been to other locations, but this is one of the best.

Wow!!! Absolutely incredible experience!  Immediately after meeting Dr. Coffey, you know that something will be very different from all your previous chiropractic experiences.  Dr. Coffey is patient, friendly and above all else- at the very top of his game.  He took his time to explain the different techniques that he offers along with the benefits. All I can say is that I left his office a believer.   I will not go to anyone but Dr. Coffey and would travel a great distance to see him if I ever relocated.  This is not an exaggeration, this truly has been my most pleasant experience at a doctor's office ever!  I left my appointment feeling more educated and most important of all, I was pain free shortly thereafter.

I've been a member of Litetime for years, but Gilbert is one of my favorite locations. The employees in the child care center are great and really care for my children. BUT the best part about this gym is My trainer Shannyn. I've only been with her for five months and have seen such a dramatic change in my strength and body composition. I'd highly recommend her!

This salon was recomended to me by a coworker. I have been super pleased with every visit. I usually will get a pink polish pedi and a shellac mani. The mani will last about two weeks... I love no having to worry about my nails chipping but if you don't keep up with it your nails feel somewhat thin without it.  Despite the downside of a shellac manicure every employee here is super friendly. I've never had bad service. The older lady that I had the last time could make my foot crack in places I never knew could. I always feel like their main focus is on relaxing the patron and not upping their sale to make a tip. Love love love this place!!!! It's decor is beautiful and is super clean.

I have to make an appointment for an hour later to ask a basic price question while there are employees just standing around. Now that's customer service.

Made the trip with my two toddlers to get the car washed and was told it would take close to an hour. Person who greeted me was neither pleasant nor did he smile - he just asked the basic questions and tried to upgrade me on everything. I also experienced the typical badgering from the auto glass company... no thank you! Knowing it would take a bit, I came prepared to wait with my children. We sat and watched the cars go by inside and then waited outside for well over an hour where they continually yelled out for the cars that were finished. After over an hour my car was nowhere to be found. Finally I ask the clerk for help and she grabbed the manager. The manager then led me to my car that was parked although I had been at the location the entire time. When I got to my car it was NOWHERE NEAR CLEAN. They missed obvious spots or should I say entire areas on both the outside and the interior of the car. When I attempted to say something to the manager he completely ignored me and ran off.   BOTTOM LINE... it was an absolute waste of $20 as my car is no cleaner now than before. Don't expect any sort of customer service either.

This is not my usual place, but when in town it's the only nail salon I will go to. I can always walk in and get service. Everyone is friendly and I love that they use OPI products. For a pedi with scrub I only paid $27 + tip. It's cheap and definitely worth it!

This is a review for the Starbucks inside. I ordered a Vanilla Rooibos  tea from an employee named Taylor. (A branded item from Starbucks) Taylor said, "This ain't Dutch bros lady!" I was appalled. I let him know it was a drink Starbucks has and he said he didn't know how to make it with a rude tone. I was so blown away by the rudeness and lack of customer service I left and went to the Starbucks down the street at Bashas.

Amazing business and staff! They designed and wrapped my son's DOC band free of charge. Super friendly and welcoming. I would recommend them based solely on their friendly customer service.

They've been out of vanilla roobois tea for three weeks now. Who does inventory? Stevie Wonder? Also there's also 6+ employees, 4 who just stand and talk and it takes an average of 5+ minutes for a drink. Most inefficient Starbucks I've been to.

Company calls me nonstop after I've requested to be removed from their list. Sales associates are rude and call several times in a row on purpose. When I've asked for them not to call,  they then ask what time I would like my appointment for- just to be a smart ass. Would NEVER do business with them.

I've been a big fan of over easy before the expansion when it was just a small hole in the wall and you waited over 2 hours just for a table. Since then I've visited several locations and have been somewhat satisfied with the food. It's definitely changed over the years and not necessarily for the better. However, this location has now become the absolute slowest of them all. I type this review as I'm going on over an hour wait after ordering my food and am staring at an expediting window with an overflowing printer full of tickets while a man who appears to be a manager rolls silverware and has no regard for the kitchen being so overwhelmed. Plates have been sitting in the window and our server has disappeared for the last 30min .... Probably because of her embarrassment for the longest wait time in breakfast history.
