Great store and cheap prices. They have all the games you can possible imagine, reasonable prices. Also you can play any game all day pass, login online use Xbox live. Play multiple players and save game.  Also arcade games if you like old school, once I walked in I felt like a little kid once again. I will definitively come back many times.
