Such a cool book store. It has books, trinkets, journals, incense and much more. Stop by this place and find a cool gift for a friend.

Store is always clean. Every staff member is helpful and have good recommendations on products. The check out lanes can be pretty busy at times. I've only gone in a couple of times when they were out of something I wanted.

This place has great decor but that is where the greatness stops. The service was very slow, the server Michelle only checked on us twice and she forgot to bring creamer and it took one of us to track her down im the restaurant to get some creamer. The food took really long to come out, for some simple brekfast items it shouldn't take 40 minutes. When the food did come out it wasn't hot, it was warm but it seemed like it was probably sitting at the window for a while. My friend ordered the "Minimum Wage" breakfast and it only came with one piece of toast. I had the french toast, which had too much cinammon on them, kind of cold and the fruit that came with it was stale. I was excited to try this place out because I live near by, but I definitely won't be returning or recommending this place to out of town visitors.

I've been here twice and both times the food has been eh. Today I got the chicken club. The bread was not toasted and saturated in the grease from the chicken.  My friend described the pizza as a Totinos and my other friend said the tacos had a good sauce but the seasoning was just off, salt was needed. The beer is good of course, so come here for the beer, but eat before you come. The manager was nice, he said he would exchange the food, but I was already turned off.
