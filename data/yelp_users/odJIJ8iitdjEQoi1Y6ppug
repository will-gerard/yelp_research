I am not a huge fan of Sushi but I have eaten here a few times. I really like the decor and the whole atmophere of this place. Every time I have eaten there the staff have been great and the food as well. I would recommend Sekai to anyone who loves sushi and wants a less corporate / cookie cutter sushi experience.

Today was my first day visiting this office, my initial impression from outside was to be a little skeptical. As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a very nice looking office that was very clean and a little stylish.   The staff greeted me with smiles and we're very helpful and polite. My appointment was prompt and Dr Jacobson was very detailed in her assessment.   As a new patient I noticed that in the initial paperwork they asked me some stuff about how I felt about Dental work and things I didn't like. They also asked me about what I do for fun and some other small personal questions. I was pleasantly surprised that Dr Jacobsen took t he time to read these questions and she knew right away that I did not like needles.   I do not like needles , every time I have to get one of those stupid shots its a really bad experience for me. That being said, i didn't even feel the shots I got today, Dr Jacobsen made small talk with me (some things from my questionnaire which I really appreciate) and was very gentle in this regard. This was so much better than other places I ask myself if I have maybe just had bad dentists before!   At the office today I had a filling that had fallen out , they got me in on a days notice, fixed my issue and had me out in less than an hour!   I had just spent the previous day at a different dentist who was trying to convince me a small filling needed a root canal. They offered me no explanation as to why at a technical level and would not budge that it could be something else.   My experience at Dr Jacobsen's office was a completely different one. They got me in on time, gave me a small filling for my tooth and explained in detail why I likely only needed a filling instead of a costly and painful root canal.     Everything about my appointment was great and I have to say this was best dental appointment of my life.

Ate here for the first time tonight.  My son got the fish tacos. They arrived (delivery) cold and were honestly about the worse Fish tacos I have eaten. The fish isn't battered and there is no sauce of any kind on them. The fish tacos came with rice and beans which would have fit in at any workplace or hospital cafeteria. My wife described the rice as the worse rice shes ever eaten.  We also got a steak Chimichanga (which cost like 9.50!)  this was pretty good nothing to write home about but still decent.  I got a Gordo Burro it was pretty good but again nothing special. We also ordered the Medium chips and salsa which was 4.00 and the amount of salsa they give you for that is pretty tiny.   Also our food came with NO hot sauce.   I can't say anything was awful but I also can't see myself every eating here again.

We stopped by here a few weeks ago and received a completely burned to a crisp burger. This burger cost around 7 dollars. I was pretty annoyed because we don't always eat fast food but we decided to this night because we we're running short on time. By the time I had went through the drive through and got home (and now had the need to return my food) I could have just made it on my own.   What is really bad through is that I attempted to contact Wendy's and when they finally responded to me they promised me that someone from the restaurant would be contacting me.   Its been about 3 weeks not and I have contacted them back multiple times and no one from this restaurant can even bother to send me an email saying "Hey we're sorry we looked into it and took care of it."   Really poor service I do not plan to eat here again.

This theater is comfortable, you can pre-reserve your seats, it has fair prices and great food!   I've been going here for years, it is the only theater I will go to. There were a couple bad years where the service was awful, I definitely am going to this place FAR less because of that but that last few times I have went the service has been awesome and the food is great.   AMC has done quite a bit to improve after a couple bad years.

This is the worst doctors office I have every been to. At Family first you will never see an actual doctor, in the years I was going there I never once saw the actual physician.   If you ever have ANYTHING you need a follow up on, this is not the right place for you. In the time I have been going here I once had some labs I was anxiously waiting on and had to call them six times to get anyone to talk to me about them. This office has literally never returned a single phone call from me. The only thing they do well is schedule you for appts and then collect your copay.   Every time you go here you should expect to wait for 30 - 60 minutes past your appt time. If you ever do make an complaint about this the staff does not care.   Also After writing a review of their services on their facebook profile, they  removed reviews from their entire Facebook profile. That REALLY shows what kind of an office this is.

Went out for dinner tonight at garcia's.  I have been here a few times recently and it is looking a little weathered.  Tonight we arrived and waiting in the entrance I noticed that no one bothered to greet me.  When it time to be seated they took me to my booth which sad a pretty loud section. After being left at the table we waited a few minutes but noone showed up to get our drink order.  At some point someone brought us chips.  We waited,  decided on our order, chatted and ate chips.  While we waited saw other people getting served.  Eventually after about fifteen minutes and most of the chips,  we decided to leave.  On the way out someone tried to take our order but we went to  Serrano instead.

Went here for the first time tonight. I have a family of four and we all got an entree along with some egg rolls and Crab Angels. I am really happy with this place the Crab Angels were the best I have ever had. The Egg rolls were fabulous. All of our entrees were on par with or better than any Chinese food I have eaten in years.   I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived to see that it was very clean and they have a window right into the kitchen.

I have used Eat24 to have them deliver to my house and while the 3rd party delivery service are slow (60 - 80 minutes) and rude, most every time the food has been delicious. I just finished eating the best fajitas I have ever eaten from anywhere and it came from this place.   So far I have tried the Carne Asada Burrito which was pretty good, Carne asada fries which were just delicious and the Chicken Fajitas which as I mentioned were the best I ever had.   Enjoy!  ***Update we have eaten here many many times since my initial review.***  This place has the best fish tacos I have ever eaten. They have a deal where you can get two Fish Tacos and two Carne Asada tacos for around 7 dollars. Some of my other favorites here are the Grande Breakfast Burrito which is the biggest Burrito I have ever gotten from anywhere, the Chilli Releno pepper which is just $2.99 and smothered in cheese and the Super Nachos.   This is my favorite place to get Mexican food in AZ.

We have been looking for a good Chinese place out here in Mesa for a long time. It looks like we found it.   We have ordered twice from here and both times the food was on time and was very good. We have tried their orange chicken which is as good or better than anywhere else I have had it, their chow mein which was better than I have had it anywhere else, their Tofu which was again delicious and finally their Kung Pao chicken.   You get alot of food for a good price and it comes hot! Try these guys out and hopefully you will be happy you did!

I've ordered from Frankies several times. I really like their pizza. It's hard for me to nail down what it is that is different about their food than other places but All in all I think they do good job.

I needed to get a haircut on Saturday and used their online app to check in at 5:45. It let me know that I would need to arrive before 6 because the shop was closing. I arrived at 5:55 , the second I walked in the door the two people who were rapidly cleaning up immediately say, "SORRY WERE CLOSED" I told them I had checked in online. They told me that it was too late.   To me it seemed like they saw my check in and both decided that they didn't want to stay later than 6 (despite what the app says). I can understand that feeling but it was just as much inconvenience for me to drive all the way there as it would be for them to cut my hair. If the same said "sorry were not taking anyone or even if I had arrived after the time it specified I would not be upset. But that is not what happened.

Ordered takeout, 2 orange chickens and a Kung pao chicken. The food got here on time but nothing was very good. The orange chicken had to be the worst orange chicken I have ever ate. The Kung Pao was not spicy and had barely any chicken.

Tonight I ordered some food from Brooklyn V's. When the food arrived they packed it all into a pizza box to hold the individual containers. Along with the food was a fairly large roach dead in the box.   When I called the restaurant they did not sound surprised nor did they even bother to apologize. I have to think that this says they have some sort of problem over there.

I have been here one time and I got a sandwich along with the 2 lbs of vegetables. The thing to know about this place is you pick your food and then you pick how spicy you want it. I chose the level 4 spice which is named Ghost pepper or something like that. I like spicy food and can handle a high amount of heat , while I wont say it was too much for me I will say that I was amused at the predicament I had placed myself in. The veggies were great but the spice was pretty intense.   My vegetables had a nice variety which included pineapples. You might thing that pineapples would help you with some of the heat but instead of help the pineapples were more like little bombs exploding spicy sauce all over my mouth. When I go again I am going to try the level 5! Angry Crab sure seemed to be alot better than the other crab shacks I have eaten at!

I have had food delivered a few times now from Fresh Millions. This is probably my favorite place to get a sandwich these days! I don't think I have had a authentic Panini before eating at Fresh Millions so maybe thats part of it but they have to have the best bread I have eaten that wasn't homemade.   My personal favorites here are.   The Steak Panini:  This is kind of like a Philly Cheese Steak but with not in a hoagie roll. We have ordered this a few times now and each time it has been delicious.   Chicken Tikka Masala:  This was a little like curry on a sandwich. It was delicious.   Buffalo Chicken Salad: Wow this was a great salad. Their buffalo chicken sauce was great!   Each time I have ordered the deliver guy has showed up in less than an hour.
