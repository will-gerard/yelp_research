This is one of the best Chinese food places in Scottsdale.  Highly recommended. The staff here is AWESOME and I love coming here

I would have to say that 80% of the time I come in to get pizza "the hot-n-ready" philosophy is not true. I have to wait for the pizza and it does get old and that's why I do not come here very often anymore.
