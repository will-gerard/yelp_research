Second time ever at this location and will be my last. It's lunch Tim and they are dead should have been the first sign of a problem, but ignored it and ended up with room temperature orange chicken and burnt fried rice. Last time I was here the rice was burnt then too, was hoping it was just a single bad incident but nope, two for two.

Worse KFC ever!!! Drive through takes forever they only do one car at a time a each car takes about 5-6 minutes. Service is horrible. The inside is filthy. And there phone is disconnected so you can call to complain.   Today they have someone who has a very strong accent over a horrible speaker so you can't understand anything she says.   Don't waste your time as it will take a lot of it if you do.

This is the worse Panda for service ever.. Every time I come in they have a line to the door. This is not because they have a lit of customers but because they can't handle more than one customer at a time. From rice to register one person at a time. Son instead of stacking people up at the register have them wait for ordering. They have enough employees, tonight I've seen 4 other nights I've seen 5. However usually just one working the line and two cooking and prep. The other one or two are either just standing around or doing less important thing than serving customers. I've been waiting for 15 min with one 3 people in front of me and now I have one in front. So another 10min and in may get or order.

Freaky Slow... Slowest Jimmy Johns I've ever been to. There was no line when I walked in only about 4 booths taken with existing customers and it takes the guy about 3 min to ask me for my order then another 10 minutes to make the sandwich.  It is also the dirtiest one ibe ever been in as well.   I will be avoiding this location in the future.
