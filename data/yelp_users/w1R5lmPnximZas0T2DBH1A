This is what I've come to expect from Waffle House. Great food with excellent customer service. My new home store since the one two blocks from my house is run by a cranky, sarcastic non-clean district manager (Kyle I was told is his name)

Normally great food and service. Today was a different story. Employee cutting/making food without gloves. I asked him to put gloves on before he prepared my food and I was met with attitude. He sarcastically told me he has been busy and washed his hands 9 times already. When I asked for the manager, he told me he was the regional manager. Continued with sarcasm and rude comments. I walked out with my 2 starving kids.  I live 2 blocks away and I. Won't. Be. Back.

Walked in, got super excited as the Newcastle vs Everton game was on the television. Downhill after that.   Not a single customer in the place, but every table was dirty, trash on the floor, seats in disarray. Took 25 minutes to get our food. Still haven't cleaned. Ugh.   Next....
