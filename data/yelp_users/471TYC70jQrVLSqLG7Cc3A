Pretty good food for a quick breakfast.  Prices are normal for the location and industry.  Saturday and Sunday mornings they are really busy.  If you are in a hurry, it can be a bit frustrating.  Parking is limited, but people tend to get in and get out fast, so parking spots tend to open up quickly.        Standard leaded coffee is good.  Recommend the breakfast bagel sausage sandwich on a six cheese bagel and their fresh squeezed orange juice.  Service is good.  Everyone is hustling and trying to get people thru as quickly as possible.

I've been coming to this location since 1998.  Morning breakfast.  Mandarin Orange muffin and a large Mango ice tea everyday for nearly 5 years when I worked at the office building next to the mall.    Cookies are awesome.  Soups are great and sandwiches are wonderful.  I highly recommend the club sandwich and tomato soup.  If you need a snake size sugar rush, grab a box of chippers.  Comes in 15 or 6.  Also makes a great gift for your sweetheart.    I've never tried their decorative party cookies, but the look amazing in the case.  Free refills on sodas and tea.    Almost forgot,  try the lemon zest cookies.  Never found anything as close to perfect as this cookie.

Let me start by saying, the DMV employees have a thankless job.  However, the customer service here is not the greatest.  There systems aren't terrible.  You have to get in one line to get a number for another line, depending on what you need.    Building is pretty plain, but clean.  Pretty typical of a government run office.  Parking is limited.  I'm here on a Thursday afternoon, and it's slammed.  I recommend calling ahead and finding out when the off peak or slow days/times are.  I'm guessing mornings are much slower than afternoons.  I was hear just to get my license photot updated.  Evidently, licenses are good for something like 40 years, but your picture expires every 10 year?  That sound strange to me.    I had to speak to three four different people for a simple photo updated.  And after all of that, they punched a hole in my license, and gave me a sheet of paper to serve as my temporary license (that will be fun to carry in my wallet).  They said my new license will arrive via the mail in 10-15 days!  Crazy that in todays day and age where we have 3-D printers, that it takes the DVM to 10-15 days to print and mail a new license.

This is a great hike for those that desire a less busy mountain.  Always open parking at the commercial corner off of Lincoln and 32nd.  Grab a coffee before or after your hike.  Unlike echo canyon they allow dogs.  They are supposed to be on leashes, but the trail is rarely monitored and many hikers let their dogs off their leashes just after the parking lot.  It's a better kike for dogs that the Cholla Trail on the East side of Camelback (which also allows dogs).  Especially for small dogs, given that it has less boulders that Squaw Peak or Echo Canyon.    The trail is easy at the beginning but gets more difficult towards the top.  Toward the top of the first peak, the trail gets narrow so passing people can be a challenge.  After the first bench, you'll go into a draw and they back up a steep hill until you reach the second bench.  From here you can see Squaw Peak.  If you want to make it harder, take the trail to the South west once you reach the second bench.  View from the top is amazing and you will likely have the peak all to yourself.  Not sure what the rules are on being on the mountain at night, but I often start this hike at dusk and finish in the dark.  It's really great on nights with a full-moon.  Once your eyes adjust, you really don't need a flashlight and the city lights are amazing.

These guys are the best repair shop in the Central Valley.  Quick, flexible, always very polite.

I've been here 4 time now.  The building has a lot of turn over before becoming "The Stand".  The new owners did a great job of working with what they had to make the building inviting (paint, planters, etc) to customers to get over the stigmatism of a dive joint.    The burgers and tacos are premium grade!  One of the best burgers in central phoenix.  The fries are also good.  One of my favorites is the Salted Malts.  It will set you back nearly $5, but it's worth it.  One added perk, they serve their malts with a wide straw!  Few things are more frustrating that having to suck a malt thru a narrow soda straw.  I shouldn't have to turn red in the face just to enjoy a malt.     Most of the seating is outside.  It's shaded, but I'm guessing that it will be less desirable during Arizona's summer's months.  The service is also very good.  They do have modern kiosk cash register systems that are quick and convenient.  Definelty a must try if you're a Arcadia/Central Phoenix local.

This softball complex was named after the 18th Govenor of Arizona.  Rose is 92, and still alive living in Globe.   It a good location for softball tournaments.  Various national orginaization hold tournaments here.  I've been here coming here for 6 years, as I have three daughters playing club softball.   Fields are well taken care of.  They have fences (some softball complexes don't).  Snack bar is full service.  Try the breakfast burrito!  Delicious!  Parents, no alcohol allowed.  Pets are allowed at the nearby dog park, but no pets on the softball grounds.    Parking can be a bit of a problem during Saturday tournaments.  However, by Sunday (as teams are eliminated) parking presure is limited.
