We have been going to the Macayo's in Surprise for 8 years now, and we have never had a bad experience.  There is never a wait and the staff has always been wonderful.  Our kids love it there.

We came here tonight with friends for the Friday night fish fry.  It was the most horrible dinner.  We sat there and waited for our meals for over an hour.  Then when we got them, 1 of the fish fry's were still frozen inside and the other 3 were still raw.  The waitress was really nice.  They ended up comping our dinners.

We've had their pizza delivered and have gone there for lunch.  It has always been awesome.  The staff there is always friendly.  Never had one problem.
