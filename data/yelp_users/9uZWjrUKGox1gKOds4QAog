I love Chinese food buffets. I have been Pokemon-ing them around Phoenix for years. Needless to say there are some bad ones. This is a good one. They had soooo many types of chicken.  Okay, so I was pregnant and craving chicken. That doesn't make my review any less valid. I had three plates. I would have kept going but my husband looked bored.  Nothing seemed stale and there were many options. It seemed clean for a Chinese Buffet.

I live by the original America's and have been a faithful diner there for years. I was running errands today and finally decided to try one of the franchises. I apparently chose the worst facsimile.  First, I noticed the guy who had ordered after us got a triple taco plate and a burrito. He seemed confused and told the cashier, "no, that's okay." the cashier then delivered my husband and me one plate of triple tacos, despite the fact that I had also ordered a burrito. Fine so they mixed up the order and I had to wait.  When I finally received my char broiled chicken burrito, it tasted like I had left over holiday turkey and tried to make a burrito out of it. Though I couldn't quite put my finger on it, it did not taste like Mexican food. I had to pour a whole lot of Tapatio on every bite just to eat it.  If you want America's, go to the original 7th st location.the historic house is part of the charm and the food tastes authentic. If you're on 16th st. And camelback and you want quick food, go anywhere else.
