Our favorite place in the north valley for Vietnamese food! Great pho and bun and good service. The owner is friendly and the food is always fresh full of flavor. If you have not been here, you must go!!! The only thing missing is a beer or wine option....the it would be worth 5 stars!

I really like this place! It's super cute and clean inside and they have a GIANT selection of both gel and traditional polishes. It's a bit further of a drive from the place closest to my house, but after visiting again over the weekend I'm fairly sure i will be making the extra drive. My only complaint is that it's a bit pricey for a shopping strip salon vs a spa.

We recently joined The Village after locating to the neighborhood and left a smaller declining gym in Cave Creek. WOW, what a difference. From the moment you walk in, you feel like you are at a resort! The service and employees are excellent. The equipment is too notch and always sparkling clean...dirty gyms are my worst nightmare! The womens locker room is absolutely fantastic and had everything you could need. And the yoga. The yoga studio and teachers far exceed anything I could expect out of a non-speciality yoga studio. AND a hot studio is being built! The monthly fees are pricey, but you really get what you pay for here!

I have NEVER had a bad meal here! Amazing food, wine list and overall a great little gem in Cave Creek. My husband and I frequent this place for dinner (the tenderloin trio is amazing) and I would recommend this place to anyone who loves a fantastic meal. It's also very romantic in the winter, cozy with a nice fireplace!

We have been twice. Both times the food has been excellent and tasty, with fresh ingredients. I have had seafood both times and been very pleased with the quality and preparation. (cioppino is very good) Reasonably friendly staff with decent service. My only complaint was that the waitress this last time really had no knowledge of the wine list and that was really a bummer.

Always a wonderful meal at Dominick's! Have dined here several times since opening. Never a bad meal, always great wine and the service is absolutely stellar. A great place to celebrate something special!

Had a dry style for a wedding over the weekend. My hair looked absolutely horrible and as a member of the bridal party seeing the pictures is very upsetting. It was stringy and kinky and looked awful. The stylist admitted to me it was her third day....(she also asked very personal questions which I found very inappropriate but was a nice young girl) I should have asked for someone to fix it but I was already behind so I just left. I should have done it myself and saved the $35.00.

A brilliant concept! Fresh tasty food and drinks (and a yummy looking pastry bar) all while you get the best car wash of your cars life! The wait for the car wash was well worth it and I happily passed the time while having a delicious lunch (crap cakes on mixed greens) and browsing the stores cute little market section. I just moved to the neighborhood and this will be my regular spot!

What an absolutely fantastic concept! We were referred to Jon from our Triathlon coach, Klas who had nothing but great things to say. We have hopped from shop to shop in the Scottsdale area, always searching for the best service and convenience....I think we have found the best of both worlds. Fair pricing, he comes to you (work or home), he is knowledgable, friendly and fast and can order anything you can imagine for your bike. I would highly recommend using Thrill Bikes!

We stumbled into this place after finding the doors at The Grind locked....what a fantastic surprise. Organic and local ingredients, a great craft beer selection and an owner/chef who was a delight to chat with. We just moved to the neighborhood and having a place like this with some healthy options is a huge plus for us!

Hands down the best tri store in AZ. Brooke, the owner is patient, kind and so helpful to someone like me who is new to the sport! She is great at ordering product if you need something in your size, and up follow up is great. She also gives great tips and an honest opinion, which is rare in todays world. I can appreciate a locally owned small business and will continue to help support their store while they continue to support the local tri community.

What a great find! We were sent here from a local chef/owner who RAVED about the fish here. Being a self proclaimed fish snob, I couldn't wait to check it out. They delivered! Fresh, delicious and generous portions of some of the best fish AZ has seen. (finally)  I also love that my husband can get his taco fix and I can stick to something healthy with a salad if I'm not up for tacos or fish and chips. Yum!  Also, great staff every time we have been in.

Finally! A "healthful" restaurant that is actually HEaLTHY! Great menu, fresh ingredients, friendly service. Prices on the entrees were fair and filled me up! I'm so happy to have this place in my neighborhood. I have yet to try the juices yet....prices seem a but high but I guess I'll need to go back and try them out.

Cute place! I was surprised when I walked in at the size, variety and over decor of this store. Part wine store and part bar. Father and Daughter owned and operated, both with great knowledge AND personalities. The wines we tasted and purchased were all great...we will be back!

We had been awaiting the opening of this after watching the slow crash and burn of the former wine bar. We were hoping for a fresh new spot, with great service and a more extensive wine and food menu. The Living Room delivered! We stopped in last Friday night for a glass of wine and were shocked that there was a wait! They were able to squeeze us in the packed patio and we were able to enjoy our drinks there. Live DJ on the weekends is a nice touch. Service was good....needs some work but I will chalk it up to it being new and them working the kinks out! Hoping to try out some food next visit!

I waited very patiently for this place to open. Big fans of Local Bistro we knew we would be in for a treat with this place. The decor is fantastic with a large outdoor seating area - that is very dog friendly, always a perk! It's an order at counter place, which I don't always love, as it rushes me to choose what to order but now I have been several times I have a pretty good grasp on the menu. The menu - gah! Soooooo yummy! Each meal has been tasty, fresh and thoughtful. My only complaint is the choice of oil they use in the kitchen, vegetable. Gross and doesn't really fall into the line of organic and fresh eating. Hopefully that changes one day.

Meh. They were stale and the guy working there was pretty off putting. I've had macaroons in Paris and at Essence locally and these were not near as good and overpriced. Next.
