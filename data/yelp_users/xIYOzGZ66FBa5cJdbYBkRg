Nellos rules!  I don't think the people who disliked it chose the right pizza.  Get the all meat one that has bacon, meatballs, sausage, ham etc and you will fall in love.  That or their fish pizza...it sounds kind of gross but it is really good. Their salad dressing is good too, I bought a bottle for $5.95 to take home.  Give them a shot, great food, great service, good prices and you only need to eat like 2 pieces to be stuffed!  Ignore all the NY and Chicago comments, good pizza is good pizza.

The staff is great but the beds...not so much.  The place could use an overhaul.

I'm moving to Scottsdale in a month...you know where I will be going for my haircuts?  Electric Haven.  This place is amazing, the guys inside are funny, friendly and full of stories.  They'll even give you beer too while you get your haircut.    It may seem really weird at first walking into this place...I'll admit I stepped out of my comfort zone the first time I came here but I am glad I did and you will be too.    The attention to detail your hair gets at this place is amazing and they get you ready for showtime.  Come in here before that hot date you have, before you go out for a night on the town, before a job interview or before accepting your Academy Award and you will be standing a foot taller knowing that you look your very best..  Oh yeah...try the shave too...it's a great price for a shave and the best I've had in town.

The staff is really nice, the burgers are fantastic, he portions are enough to satisfy even the biggest appetite and this all comes at an excellent price point.  Also everything is cooked right in front of you and the place is immaculate.    Some specifics about their food now: Burgers: fresh meat, seasoned perfectly, has great fresh condiments to accompany them.  Fries: you get loads of them and they are tasty.  Italian Beef: this is my favorite here with the hot peppers.  Get their burger combo, eat there in the nice clean atmosphere then unbuckle your belt because you will be stuffed full of great food!

This place is fantastic.  I have used them for Doggy Day Care, Grooming and long stays while gone.  They have been very accommodating to me and my dog Penny, especially in some emergency situations I have had to deal with.  All of the staff are great, Penny gets excited to go here (which makes me a little jealous sometimes) and she always comes home happy.  I couldn't recommend them enough!
