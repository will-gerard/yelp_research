I'm a big fan of this place.  I love the wholesale prices and I save a ton of money here.  I go through so many pet supplies for our Pet Care business (potty bags, wipes, medical supplies, toys, etc....).  I recommend it to each and every one of my dog owning clients.  The cons are the no air conditioning, and the $25 minimum purchase.  Also, I have made numerous trips to find that what I wanted was out of stock.  However, they usually get it within a week.    Overall, a great place with great prices.

Great food, and affordable as well.  My wife and I get it to go.  It travels very well.  I've had better Naan, but overall.  It's great Indian when you have the craving.  Tip:  Don't get the Meat Naan.

LOVE this place!  This is the place to go for any music equipment.  They even have weekend guitar lessons for free.  Also, they will price match with any competitor.    I understand it can be kind of intimidating to talk to the staff.  They are like the Genius Bar of the music world.  But they really are just there to help you.    I buy all of my guitars and equipment from here.  I always receive a follow up email about a week after purchase just checking up and making sure I like the product.   That's top notch customer service.

As far as a company, Famous Footwear treats me really well.  But this review is specifically for this location.   The selection available at this store is just terrible.  This might as well be an outlet store.   After stopping in several times over the past 10 years, I've never even seen a shoe, sandal or boot I actually wanted to even try on.    I order most of my shoes online through Famous, but the location at Tempe Marketplace usually has a decent selection.  Head and shoulders above the selection here.

Hadn't been in a couple of years, so we stopped in for dinner last week.   Hasn't changed at all.  The food is delicious, yet overpriced.  And the chefs are great at what they do, and are performing comedians as well.    Benihana is more an experience than anything else.  We took our nephews who were in town visiting.  It was their first time, and obviously they loved it.  Watching the chefs cook is really why you dine here.  It's culinary entertainment.  If you've seen one show, you've seen them all.  But I like to stop in every couple of years to see it again.

I've been here twice now, and I think this is my favorite Sport Clips location.  Yes, yes, it's only a haircut...  But if it isn't a decent haircut, you have to wait 3 weeks to attempt to fix it.    Anyway, Michelle did a great job.  Plus, it's conveniently located on the same corner as Dunkin Donuts...  If you have to wait in line for a haircut, it's better to wait with an iced coffee and a chocolate cream donut.

I've been a patient of Dr. Carr's for almost 5 years now.  Finding a great dentist can be quite an achievement.  Finding the best in the business can be a miracle.  Thankfully I have done both.       When I became a patient, I had very sore gums.  I was actually in the beginning stages of what could have become Periodontal Disease.   Without hesitation, Dr. Carr and his staff began treatment on my gums.  It only took 2 visits and minimal discomfort to get my gums back in shape.  I was amazed.  I've had other dentists before who had the bedside manor of a rabid badger.  It's actually nice to visit the dentist when it's Dr. Carr's office.  You will LOVE Beverly, the office manager.  Sometimes I go just to see her.       Enough rambling.  The point is, I'm 31 years old without ever having a cavity.  I credit this to Dr. Carr and his staff.

I'm not even a picky person...  I've had many bad haircuts in my life...  You just suck it up and go someplace else the next time.  But the person did such a terrible job that I had to come back in because she missed an entire part of my head.  Wow...  I'll still visit Sport Clips, just not this location.  If this person continues to cut hair, I may have to invest in hats.

One of my favorite breakfast places.    Heads up, to prevent sticker shock on your check...  Expect $20 per person.  Some people don't think that you should have to pay $20 for breakfast.  Then again, this isn't Denny's.    The food is always delicious.  Try the biscuits and gravy, nothing too complicated.    Most likely, there will always be a wait when you get here.  This is a very popular breakfast place for tourists.  I'm not sure how they find out about it, but you won't find any special priority seating for being a local Scottsdalian.     Enjoy!

I don't need to prove my awesome writing skills in my reviews.  I don't like to waste people's time by typing, typing and typing.    So...  Great food, a little pricey, awesome staff...  Just a little short staffed, so remember to bring some extra time with you when you dine here.  4 Stars!

This is my favorite vet clinic.  As a Professional Pet Care Specialist with Absolute Pet Care LLC in Scottsdale, I understand the importance of finding a great vet who truly cares for your pet.  This is the place.  I recommend them to all of my pet clients.    My dog LOVES Dr. Wright.  He has helped her tremendously.  He even diagnosed her food allergy and she is very grateful.    The staff is amazing and Sammi loves them.  They are so patient and pleasant with her.  I'm sure it helps that she is the cutest Bull Terrier ever, but they are always happy to see her.  I wouldn't take her anywhere else.

After getting a full 'tune up' from the dealership last year (Chapman), I was told I probably had a year left on my brakes.    I noticed the front brakes squeaking a bit, and a lot of brake dust on the wheels, so I made an appointment here at Whitey's for new brakes.    After dropping it off and walking over to Denny's for breakfast, I got a call telling me that the brakes were good, just dirty.    So they just cleaned them up and gave me an oil change as well.  Less than $60.  I thought I was gonna spend about $250 that day.  Saved about $190.    That's good stuff!   I'll take my car, and my wife's car to Whitey's from now on.

I realized that I drive by Carlsbad only about 12 times per average workday, and haven't been here in 8 years.  That's nearly 35,040 times, give or take a few.  SO...  I decided it was time to give it another try.    Then I realized why I hadn't been back in 8 years.    Bland food, bland food, and bland food.   Sorry, but it's true.    Will probably be at least another 8 years.

I must have walked past this place hundreds of times before I even knew it was there.  I was invited here for a meeting of a local pet welfare group I'm involved with.  Our meeting was a small group, so this place was perfect.    Great location, great food, great prices and great service.  They even have a $5 food menu.  Cons - Very small.  Seats maybe 20 people.

Just like all of my reviews, I will be honest.  I've been a member here for 5 years.  Not a big fan.  Never, I repeat, NEVER go after 4pm.  For some reason, they have a DJ.  Yes, it is the absolute most annoying thing I have ever experienced at a gym.  Even though you can't hear your iPod because of the DJ, you still need to have your earbuds in your ears to prevent unsolicited conversation from some of the weird members.  btw - There are a TON of old creepy guys who stare at the ladies.    But hey, what gym is perfect?

The food is 5 stars!   Absolutely delicious!  BUT 3.5 stars overall.  Negatives include the SLOW service.  DO NOT go here if you are already hungry.  You can literally feel yourself aging while you stand helplessly waiting for your food.  It's not uncommon to wait a good 20 - 30 minutes.  Also a negative - Price.  I'm guessing they probably do have all of their ingredients flown in from Italy, because the price reflects it.  I guess you do get what you pay for.  Typically you'll spend $10 for a sandwich, $3-$5 on sides and $2-$3 for your drink.  The happy hour prices seem okay ($2 beer).  Seating is extremely limited.  Barely any room to even move around in here.  Also, your table is so close to the other tables that people are participating in your conversation.  Kinda creepy!  The outdoor seating is basically lawn-chair, patio furniture.   And Location/Parking.  Not the best, especially with the crazy road construction.  But I guess in the end...  It is what it is.   I still return and will continue to help support local businesses.

My review is for the service department.    Yes, I'm one of those super patriotic Americans who will ONLY purchase American-Made vehicles NO MATTER WHAT.  So of course...  I own a Chevy.    I didn't purchase my vehicle here, but I ALWAYS bring it here for service.  They are happy enough to honor the warranty, and it doesn't cost me any additional $$$ whatsoever.  (Another great reason to buy American!)  Anyway, anytime I have an issue, I call this location and ask for Len in the service department.  He has always been available, has gotten me in on short notice, AND gets it taken care of.  As a car owner, I really can't ask for anything more.  I would love to give them 5 stars, and may do so in the future.  However, the last time I was in, they didn't have the part I needed in stock.  They had to drive to another location to pick it up, which was great, but I had to wait for 4 hours.  Yes, that's 4 hours of watching divorce court on the TV in the waiting area...  Excruciating!  Also, they ran out of donuts before I arrived for my 10:30am appointment, and I was starving.  C'mon man...  I REALLY wanted those donuts!

As a fellow CheeseSteak Lover, I have to try it when I see it on the menu.  Not a fan here.  First, if you want me to come back, Why do you nickel and dime me as a customer?  That's just bad business.  $15 for my meal?  It's fast food!  Anyway, I'll sum it up...  No thanks.

This place is the definition of Artsy Fartsy...  I've attended a few movies here with my wife over the years, and I've yet to make it through one without falling asleep.  I enjoy the popcorn, but they have always been understaffed.  I've waited through lines to get in, and through long lines for refreshments.    Enjoy!

Any true Starbucks fan has visited probably 50 different locations.  Well, I'll just say that out of the 10+ times I've been here, this is still the worst.  I don't want to sound negative, so I'll just admit that I've never received quality customer service, and that parking here is an absolute nightmare (which is NOT their fault, so I gave them 2 stars).    Their customer service is more painful than a kick to the face with a golf shoe.  On a more positive note...  Hey, the sun is shining!

Love this place!  The chicken and waffles are better and cheaper than LOLOS (which is just down the street).   Disappointed I couldn't substitute my eggs for another waffle or anything, but that's just how life works, I guess.   The food is delicious.  The prices are decent.  The service wasn't bad.    4 stars!

As a Professional Pet Sitter, I've seen my share of Dog parks.  This is my favorite park in the entire valley.  The location is great, very easily accessible.  The layout is very nice and spacious.  Parking isn't very difficult either.  I like to run around with the dogs as well.  We run and play like overly-hyper 4 year olds, and just have a blast.  Great park!  I LOVE it here!  Absolute Pet Care LLC, (local Scottsdale Professional Pet Care business), will also arrange to bring client's dogs here for a great Dog Park Trip!

This is one of my favorite theaters.    It's a little known fact that the first showing of the day for any film is only $5.  This keeps my wife and I coming back.  One of our favorite things is to see a movie at 9am and hit a great spot for brunch afterwards.  And yes, they don't mind when you show up in pajamas with Starbucks.  A great time!

Discovered a leak on our water heater around 8pm on a Friday night.  Yikes!  Had to shut the water main off and call plumbers.  Luckily, I remembered our HOA uses city wide for all plumbing issues.  Their office didn't open until 8am the next morning (Saturday), but they had someone here by 10am.  Fixed the issue (wasn't the actual water heater itself).  Cost $180.  Not too bad, I guess.  Especially when you need water!

I am a fan of Stax.  I've been coming here since they opened.  Delicious food, especially the Sweet pots, Tots and Mac & Cheese.  Who doesn't like Mac & Cheese?  And obviously, the Sliders...   My only con is the happy hour.  It is from 3p-6p daily.  However, it's very difficult to get in right at that time.   Sometimes we get in at 2 or 2:30p.  Honestly, the food is great, but if you're not getting the happy hour prices, you are overpaying.    We visit for happy hour about every 3 weeks.   However, if the happy hour were extended from Open until 6pm, we would definitely visit at least once per week, maybe even more.  I really wish the owner would consider this, because we would love for it to happen.  Also, as far as the reviews regarding poor service...   The secret is to sit at the bar.  - FYI  AND...  During one of our visits...  We actually met the guy who walks around dressed as a Super Hero.  This time it was Batman!  I asked him what he was up to.  His reply, with a roll of the eyes, "Fighting Crime!"

On your first visit, you will probably go into shock.    This is one of the most amazing stores I have ever visited.  I'm not really much of an outdoors guy, but this store will turn you into one.   Just walking around it is awesome.  A great place to visit even if you aren't looking to buy anything.

4 stars for the food.  Everything we ate was Quality!  I do love the location.  Not far from my house, great neighborhood, not sketchy (so you don't have to look over your shoulder as you walk to your car), quiet area which closes down around 10pm.    Like the atmosphere and the service.  Only negative is how small the place is.  Dining at 7pm, the tables were full, place was packed, and so incredibly loud it was impossible to participate in conversation.  But oh well.  Monday Night Football was on the TV, so no conversation was actually necessary.

After our third visit here, I HAD to change my review.    Decent food and service, but we had an issue with the check.  Which is perfectly fine, we dine out often, and have worked in the restaurant industry, so these things are no big deal.  However, the manager/owner decided to argue with us, and was incredibly rude.  After arguing for a few minutes, we were ready to simply walk out and never return.  He then said he would adjust the bill, took our credit card and ending up charging us an ADDITIONAL $20!!!  After he was supposed to (and agreed to) take the $20 OFF!  Trying to charge us an EXTRA $40.  I guess he didn't think we would catch it.  After he dropped off our credit slips, he disappeared.  The server explained that he knew what the owner did.  He apologized profusely, and explained that this happens all of the time.  The owner constantly overcharges people and tries to take advantage of customers.  The server fixed the issue, and of course we tipped him well for his service and even more for his honesty.    We wish the employees the best, but we will NEVER return due to the shady actions of the owner, and how terrible we were treated by him.    In 2013, I can't believe customers can still be treated so terribly by a place trying to earn repeat business.    I just don't want any other people to be taken advantage of here.

Geisha has become my go-to when I need to satisfy the sushi craving.  2 things that keep this sushi-lover coming back regularly...  Quality sushi, and affordable prices.  Aside from the decor, karaoke, and the service...  The happy hour has great pricing which make it affordable to visit once or twice every week.    If they were open for lunch, I would probably visit more often.

I used to LOVE this place when it first opened.  It was a great afternoon hangout with friends.  They had great happy hour pricing, and great music (especially the old hairband videos showing on the TV's).  The food was really good as well.  Until...   Last year the happy hour changed dramatically.  Making it quite an unhappy hour.   Very poor specials and terrible pricing.  The service became worse as a result as well.  They can't keep good staff anymore.  The food has become very bland.  And once I was told that happy hour was only on the outdoor patio.  Yes, the SMOKING patio.  The same one that has become overrun with Loud and disrespectful ASU students.    I'm not sure how this place went downhill so fast.   I won't go back anymore.  Will miss the decor though.  It's by far the best thing about this place.

The location really hurts this theater (being in a mall).  2 things will be guaranteed with this experience: Crowds and Kids.  Things that can ruin any cinematic experience.  Additional tip: Assuming it's because of the mall location, but this Harkins Theater charges more than the others...  It's true.

This is my spot.  Great food, I can watch my game with no problem.  I have to have sound.  They really treat you right.  Oh, and did I mention the awesome food.  Plus, they'll get you home safe with a free ride.  If anyone else asks you, tell them that Sunday football there sucks.  Only because we don't want it to get any more crowded.  We don't like waiting for our beers.

Great American bar with great American cuisine.  I love having a place like this in Scottsdale.    They have a fantastic happy hour special.  You can get a burger and beer for $6 any time of day, any day of the week.    They also have a GIANT burger where the bun has been replaced with grilled cheese sandwiches.    People here aren't trying to impress anyone, they are simply here to enjoy the atmosphere and the experience.    I would feel comfortable here in my pajamas, robe and slippers.  And actually might wear them the next time I go.

I had been going here for my haircuts since it opened.  After 20 - 30 haircuts I found out that I had been overcharged.    I noticed the price kept increasing.  Each time, I was told that it was a corporate increase.   It started at $20 for a men's cut.  2 years later, I was being charged $40.    It was a great haircut, but now I go to Sport Clips.

Wow!  The happy hour is AMAZING!  If you're a fan of burgers...  try the Gladiator!  Friday happy hour is half-price burgers.     I fear I've ruined myself from ever enjoying another burger, now that I've had this one.

I LOVE the Scottsdale Greenbelt!  I've lived in Old Town Scottsdale for 6 years now, and I truly love our community.  The Scottsdale Greenbelt is a fixture which represents how beautiful and peaceful it is here.  There are many great people who enjoy it on a regular basis, and I always enjoy meeting friendly people.   I'm a professional dog walker, so I walk the Greenbelt nearly every day.  If you see me, feel free to say hello.  I don't bite, and neither do the dogs I walk.  People rollerblade, dog walk, ride bikes, skateboard, run, play disc golf, etc....  There is so much to do here and I appreciate it very much.  Sorry if I sound a little cheesy, I'm just passionate about our community.  CONS - There are many homeless people who camp out around the Greenbelt area as it runs into Tempe.  Be careful.  Not sure what the Politically Correct terminology is anymore, Bums? Transients?  Homeless?  I've heard of a few muggings at night.  Anyway, if you spend a lot of time on the Greenbelt you will run into them.  Once, while dogwalking, I saw a guy showering in the sprinklers.

I am a HUGE FAN of this place!  All caffeine lovers have to try it at least once.    4 shots in every drink with no additional shot charges!    Located in the heart of Old Town, a.k.a. My Hood!    They also sell $12.50 gift cards for only $10.  You save $2.50 instantly.    Only cons -   Be patient, drinks this great take a little more time to make.    Not open on Sundays.

Delicious!!!    I was able to stop in here between dogwalking appointments yesterday, and I'm very happy I did.  Great food, great staff and great location.  I am a die-hard burger fan, and LOVED the sweet and spicy burger.    Try it!  The parking lot can be difficult.  There's a lot going on in that little strip mall area.

I really like RnR.  My wife and I have brunch here occasionally.  The food is delicious and I like the atmosphere.  It's classy, yet comfortable without being too trendy.    I haven't been after dark because I'm not a fan of the late night crowd.  But I can say that it's a safe place to enjoy during the day.    In fact, I have just talked myself into going there today.  See you there!

I was very excited to see something nice move into this location.  Fresh and Easy is relatively inexpensive, but I'm always reminded that they don't accept coupons (they only accept their own coupons) or award a bag credit like most of the other grocery stores.  I do like that they have a hybrid parking space right up front for me.  Pros - This store attracts some really nice people to this rundown strip mall area.    Cons - Most of the produce here is neither Fresh nor Easy.  In fact, I've seen many items pass their expiration date while they're still on the shelf.

My wife and I tried this place last week.   We really enjoyed the ice cream.    The alcohol and ice cream combination is an amazing concept.    This is a place where adults can enjoy ice cream without screaming children around, dropping theirs on the floor and making an uncomfortable scene.    The staff was friendly and very helpful.  I always feel like I'm wearing them out while trying so many free samples.    I've noticed that when people give businesses a negative review, it's mostly to blame on the reviewer.    People have a habit of bringing expectations with them when they are trying someplace new.  Many reviews start off with...  "I was so excited to try this place..."    Well...  Stop That!    Leave the expectations at the door, then judge the experience for what it is.  With so many local 'mom & pop shops' closing, hopefully this place will stick around.  The ice cream is tasty!

Stopped in for a quick bite on our way to the movies.  Food was decent, but extremely overpriced.  Most likely due to the Tempe Marketplace location.  The customer service was rough!  After dealing with the people behind the counter, I was reminded that having a customer service based conversation with a teenager can be as pleasant as a kick in the teeth.  I don't see a return visit in my future.

I know Sue personally, and she is amazing with pets.  If she lived here in the Old Town Scottsdale area, she would definitely be my pet sitter.    Our pet care business doesn't travel north of Shea.  We receive many calls every single week from pet owners who live north of our service area.  I happily refer all of them to Sue and her staff.  Too many people don't truly understand what it takes to be a professional pet sitter or dog walker.  We aren't random people found on Craigslist trying to make extra money or steal your things.  We are true professionals who are licensed, bonded, insured and most importantly, certified.    All pet owners should be registered with a quality professional.  I highly recommend Sue.  Go ahead, give her a call.

The small plates on the happy hour menu were great.  The staff was pleasant and helpful.  Very disappointed that overall, The Mint is desperately trying to be the next flashy, trendy location in the neighborhood.  As a person who actually lives in Old Town, and not just a visitor who is impressed with flashy clubs, I saw little effort or focus on return clientele.  Most businesses strive for returning customers.  This place is just desperate to be the hot spot for 'Right Now.'  With most of the clubs closing around here, Old Town doesn't need any more trendy places.  Just more relaxed and enjoyable ones.  I don't see this place being here 2 years from now.

Not a fan.  The food was dry and bland.  Not sure how someone could make a bland burger.  Just add salt and pepper.  Too pricey for such limited return as well.   Too many other great places in the area to come back here.

I've been here for lunch twice.  I'll be back!  For some reason, and I have NO CLUE why, there aren't many great options for asian buffets here in Scottsdale.  This place works for me.    Great variety, traditional dishes, very well done.  They keep the food freshly rotated and will toss out the food that has been sitting.  They have a lot of sushi options as well.  I LOVE sushi, but can't bring myself to eat buffet sushi.  Though it looks great, I just need my sushi to be freshly made to order, so I will hit Stingray or Geisha for my sushi fix.  But that's just me.  Definitely don't let me stop you from trying it.  It's kind of pricy, but it's worth it.  Usually when a buffet charges more, it helps keep the riffraff out of the restaurant, which helps make the experience even better.  No one wants to sit down for a meal only to look across the aisle at Honey BooBoo.    Try this place!

Great happy hour food & drinks.  The bar staff was great as well.   I typically hesitate to write a great review for most places because after I do, they become overcrowded and I can no longer enjoy them.    But I will be back!

The dog food prices are very affordable and beat the large stores (PetSmart & Petco) by quite a bit.    Also, I really like that they specialize in quality food instead of the cheap, conveniently found food that is really dangerous to pets (like Kibbles & Bits, Ol Roy, etc.).   I approve!

FINALLY, More BBQ here in Old Town Scottsdale!  Food was great!  They even let you try a sample before ordering.    Staff was 5 Stars!  There is NO wait staff.  You order your food, get your drink, sit down, eat, leave.  Really awesome concept.  You can get in and out at your own pace.  A nice change from most of the restaurants here in old town.   I'll definitely be back.

As an Old Town local, I think I've been to every single restaurant/bar here at least once.    I can honestly say I have never been treated so terribly at a restaurant in my life as I was treated here.  There was even a situation where a sauce ramekin fell off my wife's plate, and the bartender was extremely rude.  He blamed her for the mess and said she should clean it up.  He even made a scene in front of other bar patrons about it.  I'm not sure what his problem was.  But the staff made this a terrible experience for us.  We ended up leaving after that.  Staff - NO STARS.   Drinks - Overpriced for the little return.  This is another place where they came up with "signature" drinks that aren't anything special but overpriced.   Food - 1 star.  The chef tried to be too creative here.  Keep the food delicious, not too experimental.  We tried the fried cauliflower.  Yes, it was just as it sounds.  No thanks.  Also, just a side note:  I'm not sure if it's a hipster thing or what... But the employees seemed kind of dirty.  Like they didn't shower regularly.  Not someone I want to handle my food.  Not good for a place hoping to earn repeat customers.   Just my two cents.  Just a bad experience overall.

Only here once, but will definitely be back.    The food was good.  4 stars.    This place would be MUCH busier if they had happy hour on the weekend.  MUCH BUSIER!  If fact, I would probably be a regular.    They have a great beer selection.  Staff was okay.   They did a great job of creating a fun environment in the back.  They have darts, washers, tetherball, jenga, ping pong, etc.  It seems like a great place to hang out.  The real negative here is that they make it a little too kid-friendly.  I wanted to try out all of the fun things in the back, but too many kids were out there just running around and hogging the ping pong table.  Not cool for people wanting to have fun and a few drinks.  I'm certain they would make more profit from selling more cocktails instead of milkshakes.   Either way, I'll be back.  - UPDATE -   I appreciate being contacted regarding my review.  I always try to be honest and fair.  I was told that kids usually clear out by 8pm.  However, as a long time Old Town resident, I know that Old Town is a day drinking location.  ESPECIALLY with the locals.  Locals like to enjoy their city by heading out early around 10am, start with a bloody, have cocktails and food throughout the day, enjoy the outdoor bar patios, and be home by 6pm.  That's just how we locals do it...  Old Town residents practically have it mastered.    My visit here seemed like I was trying to enjoy a beer in the sun in the middle of grade school recess.  Kids were running around, being loud and crazy like kids do I guess.    Just my two cents.  But of course I'll be back to try it again.

One of my fave places to come get a burger, tots and enjoy happy hour.    I waited quite a while to write a review though.  As an Old Town local, I've seen many restaurants come and go.  Way too many actually.    But I waited because the same thing always happens.  When I find a great place, I need to keep it a secret because when I come back, it's bombarded with patrons and I can't get the same experience I had before everyone else found out.    Honestly, I don't like crowded places.  I like to enjoy the experience and relax.    Only 4 starts because I really like the food & the atmosphere, but the place gets too crowded.  The patrons are squeezed in so tightly that I feel like we're all dining together.  Not cool when other customers can breathe on the food you're eating.

If you know me at all...  You know I don't like to waste your time writing extensive reviews.  I'm just not attention-needy enough to force you to keep reading, reading, and reading about my opinions.    So here you go...  The biscuits and gravy were a little dry.  But unless you're having B&G in the South, it will never be the best!  So it's a pass.   The meat-lovers Benedict was great.  Try it.  DEFINITELY go here for brunch and get the Breakfast Burrito.  The BEST I've ever had!  Just do it!  In fact, get off your freaking computer, drive here IMMEDIATELY and get the Breakfast Burrito.  NOW!    You don't even have to thank me.

I always attend the festivals here.  They are usually put on really well.  This one was hot.  No fans or misters in any of the tents to cool us off.    However, I do know the secrets to having a great time here.  And ALWAYS have an absolute blast!    But instead of sharing them with everyone, and making this event even MORE CROWDED next year...  I'll just keep them to myself.

We purchased a new home this year which had been vacant for a few months.    Obviously, a few uninvited guests made it inside.  We saw spiders, silverfish, ticks, etc.  We called Insectek and they took care of it.  Lucio is our guy.  He comes every other month and takes care of business.   Also...  We have 2 dogs which we prefer to have gone while they spray our home with poison.  So their scheduler was able to schedule our appointments at the same time of our dogs' grooming appointments.  Which helps out a ton!

This place is exactly what you think it is...  It's a sports bar, but it's a large chain of BWWs, so everything is corporate.    You definitely don't get that feeling of a neighborhood sports bar like Duke's, Zipps or Pranksters where you can really feel at home and be appreciated for being a regular customer.   The food is pretty average.  The servers are all nice, but they are all pretty young, so there are some mistakes.  Just bring your patience and leave your expectations at home.   One thing I was REALLY surprised by:  So many parents brought their kids with them.  No sports bar (or sit down restaurant in general) is kid friendly.  Imagine people drinking beer and yelling profanities at all of the TVs.  That's exactly what happens.   I guess that's why it's so strange to see kids in a sports bar.  During my visit, there were so many kids, you couldn't walk to the restroom without tripping over one.   Just weird.

I really like this location.  As a long-time, Old Town resident, I love supporting all of our local restaurants & bars.    The staff was really nice, overly nice actually.  Kind of strange, but I'll take it.   The food was pretty good.  I'm not a pasty guy, but I can't complain about it since I decided to dine at a place which specializes in pasties.  That's on me.    The only con is that this place seems like a hipster hangout.  Each time I've been, I've noticed quite a bit of those annoying types.  They can ruin any environment.      But overall, I like this place.

This place is great!  To keep it simple, I love the food, the drinks, the happy hour, and the bar staff was excellent!    I don't know what is wrong with most yelpers, but if you want to review a restaurant as an actual critic does, you need to not bring expectations along with you.  Too many yelp reviews have been based off of expectations, but those are completely wrong.    Just go dine, take it all in, and then present your review, if needed.  Also, we don't need to hear every single detail of your bun, sauce, taste of the burger, crisp lettuce, blah, blah, blah, blah, BLAH!!!!   We get it!!  You think you're a creative writer!  But no one cares!   Just go here, eat some food, have some drinks, and enjoy yourself!  You're welcome!

The food is delicious.  The staff is really nice and friendly.  I'm not a big fan of the ordering system how everything you order is literally ONE instead of one order or serving.  Therefore you have to order a lot, and if you don't eat it all, they will charge you an additional amount for what you didn't eat.    Also, just a heads up, when they get busy, you will wait a very long time for your food.
