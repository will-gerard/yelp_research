Well I guess it serves me right getting a breakfast burrito from a "Sandwich" shop, but the flyers were all over my workplace but lesson learned...It never looks as good as the picture. Hit up The Burrito Company or Filaberto's for a good breakfast burrito.

Great food and curteous staff! Support local businesses; no thanks Denny's or Starbucks I'll take Cafe 25:35 any day!!!  I had their Buckeye a Big Boy breakfast and coffee, honestly I couldn't find anything to complain about. It was very good and more than reasonably priced. My wife and I will become regulars of Cafe 25:35 going forward.

Service was subpar...my chicken pesto sandwich had MOLD on the bun...the boar & pork tacos were cold and the coleslaw didn't taste fresh...my other friend had the chopped salad which she was was just "okay"... I don't believe we'll be back.
