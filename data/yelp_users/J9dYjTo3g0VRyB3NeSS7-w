I hope I happened to stop by on an "off" day.... Ordered a meat lovers pizza over the phone and was quoted a 20min wait. I showed up after only 15 because I was near by, but then had to wait another 25 min before my pizza was ready. When I got home with my pizza, the crust was so thick and the whole thing was under cooked (I'm not sure what was cooking for the 40min I waited for this thing!) Even after throwing slices into my own oven to try to crisp them up, they were still mush. The flavor wasn't anything to write home about.... It was just "eh".

Way better food than any of those blah blah blah-Berto's places at still fantastic prices. Some if our favorites are: shredded beef chimichanga, California burrito, breakfast burrito, and any of the aguas frescas. The tortillas always taste fresh and the salsas are full of flavor.

We started with the butcher's block (literally a wood block FILLED with the most delicious cheeses, olives, hummus, dry aged meats, bread, and heaven) then followed with the bruschetta plate.  We chose 4 different selections, but our favorite was the one with arugula.  We had planned on order a pannini to split and a cup of soup after this, but we were so stuffed we did not get passed the apps!  And for location and clientele (valet parking usually scares us off.... haha!), we were surprised we walked out of there with full, satisfied tummies and a slight buzz for less than $50!  We cannot wait to get a sitter again and check it out.  Right now they have a deal on Monday and Tuesday evening for a bottle of wine and the bruschetta for like $20. Whoa!

Walked in with a pair of sunglasses that were "stretched out" and requested a hot sand treatment to reshape them.  The guy behind the counter said he could do that, but they would most likely bend out of shape slowly again and would cause discoloration over time (they have a really unique tortoise type coloring in the plastic and I would hate to distort it).  He came up with a better solution that only cost $12, took 5 min, and is pretty much permanent.  Amazing!  I will definitely be back with any future frame repairs I need for my other sunglasses or eyeglasses.

If you're in the mood for anything Mediterranean, don't bother going any where else. We have ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and LOVED every single thing we try. Not only is the food delicious, the staff is always welcoming and friendly. Even after moving to the East Valley, we come back any time we are nearby and have yet to find anything that comes close to all the deliciousness this places holds.

Such a friendly staff and great food.  Pretty much anything you order, you are guaranteed to be full and happy!  Tip: pass on the waffles, and go for the cinnamon roll!

Service is always friendly and attentive. I will admit the prices are slightly higher (maybe $1 or so higher) but the portions are perfect and the meat is never oddly colored or mysterious cuts.  Chef Andre, the owner, picks out quality product to make quality food and will never accept anything but the best for his customers. I'm glad we finally live within 15min of this place instead of driving 45min each way... which we have been for the last 7 or so years.  We even had them cater our pre-wedding event about 5 years ago.

1. TERRIBLE SERVICE: the waitress never checked on us because she was busy talking to a group of guys sitting at the counter, the same guy (manager?) Cooked the food, bussed the tables, and took orders at the counter. 2.DIRTY: luckily I didn't visit the restroom til after lunch, because I almost lost my lunch in there from the filth that covered every square inch of it. The table and menus even smelled of old mildew water.   3. LET'S MAKE UP EXTRA FEES: they charged me extra for CHEESE on a GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH. When I asked her about it, she confirmed with the manager that "yes, we charge extra for American cheese" even though it was a listed choice on the menu.  Again, not EXTRA cheese, she charged me for cheese being on a cheese sandwich.  WHAT THE WHAT??!!

Don't bother with anything but the sandwiches.  My husband was sooo disappointed in his pizza (the Old World "Spicy") and jealous of my Smokey Joe and my brother's Pesto Grilled Chicken.  Although the pizza was ok, it did not compare the the layers of flavor and freshness in the sandwiches.  Even our 4 year old loved the Smokey Joe.  She kept commenting on how "so much good" it was.  The boys also enjoyed the bottled beer $1.95 special, and I had a hot caramel macchiato (so delicious... there was a hint of cinnamon or hazelnut or something- overwhelming goodness!)  My brother picked up some cookies, which they admit are not made in house, and they were also delicious.  They had more of a cookie DOUGH goodness to them, rather than a baked cookie flavor/texture.  It really worked well.  I overheard one of the girls talking to another patron about the cinnamon rolls and how hard it is for them to keep them on the shelves.  I am hoping the next time we go, we will get to try one.

I get it, you are at Fashion Square in Scottsdale, but you are also thee shittiest store in the mall. Don't look your customers up and down as we walk in and then nit-pick every time my daughter gets too close to one of your piles of clothes and tell her to stay away. I will drive to Arrowhead next time I need a pair of your shitty $3 leggings because there is a larger selection and nicer people. GTFO.

I live exactly in the middle of this location and the location at Desert Ridge on Tatum, and we decided to check this one out hoping it would not be as busy and more quiet since it was a week day night.  It sure was not busy at all, maybe 5-6 tables seated in the restaurant when we walked in.  Yet my family of 3, including a toddler, was sat in the bar in a booth that was currently being used as an arm rest for a homeless man (let's just leave it as .... he smelled....) I would have chosen a million other tables for us, but the hostess chose that one. Okay, let's roll with it.  Our waitress quickly greeted us and took our drink order and gave us a minute to decide on food.  By the time she came back with beverages, we put in our order for 2 pizzas.  Those 2 pizzas took almost 45 min to cook.  I get it, they are fresh made to order, but I have never had to wait that long for pizza!  And not once while we sat there trying not to stare at the obnoxious bartender or cringe at the smell wafting from our homeless over-looker did our waitress stop by to see if we needed refills or give us the ol' -your food will be right out- line.  When the pizzas did finally come out, they were piping hot.  I was glad to see that was the only thing this location had in common with the others-- the food is still pretty darn tasty (and worth the usual 20min wait- not 45 min).  We will not return to this location, but will continue frequenting the other locations.  Poor poor poor service....  P.S. Don't order a mixed drink.  My $10 Mojito must of contained the finest mint and simple syrup in the world because that's all the really was.

We have been a fan of their donuts for quite some time and is often a breakfast choice on special weekends or when we have out of town guests that we want to impress. But, recently we discovered the croissants. Hot hammy, cheesey.... Amazing. Even the regular ones are so flaky and moist and delicious. Also, the donut holes are another delicious (and cheap) choice. I keep meaning to try their boba drinks, but I always happen to already have a cup of coffee in hand when we stop in here.

They closed early but opened the doors for us so my mother could use her long awaited Groupon. They were very friendly, and even better... The gelato was DELISH!  Can't wait to stop in again and try more flavors!

Let me start by saying my husband and I have been OBSESSED with Chef Johnny Chu since the days he stood in front of an open flame in a 6ft open kitchen in a little 900 sq ft house on 3rd St known as "Fate".  We have been to most of his other restaurants after the tragic end of the Fate era, but have not been as satisfied.  Until last night.... when we finally had a chance to step into Sochu House. Walking in, we were a little intimidated by the soft neon lights and huge sheets of hanging white cloth (we had just come from a movie and were in the very definition of casual attire).  It took a minute to be seated because the wait/host staff could not see us standing in front from behind some of that stated white cloth, but once seated we were quickly brought menus and cucumber water.  I asked about the reverse happy hour I saw on the website from 10:30pm-close, but apparently that was only offered in the bar.  Our waiter did offer to move us to some chaise lounges available in the bar area, but we decided a proper table was necessary to stuff our starving faces at the point. We ordered: Wasabi Soy Chicken and Friend Tofu tapas and the House Dynamite with chicken entree (this was our favorite at Fate).  I held onto a menu because of the warnings of small portions from other reviews, and from our experience at Sens (his other tapas-style restaurant), I figured we might still be hungry after these 3 choices.  Surprisingly, these portions were pretty darn big and very filling! We walked out of there with a $50 bill (after drinks) and FULL, happy bellies!  We were especially please to find Johnny's home cooked goodness style we fell in love with at Fate had made a return at Sochu House. Before we had even finished our meal, we were saying how we could not wait to come back again!

The prices are high for the tiny portions that are provided. I'd understand if the sandwiches were good.... But we have yet to try one we like. The first time we stopped in, the girls that helped us were very rude. This last time, the guy and gal that helped us were actually very friendly, but still the sandwich was nothing to write home about (and was toasted to much the bread hurt the roof of your mouth).

I love their happy hour: decent prices for decent sushi (and apps and booze!) We have had terrible service and sketchy fish once (on separate instances) out of the half a dozen times we have been in there, but typically it satisfies the cravings. I suppose they specialize in those fancy rolls, but 98% of them contain cooked fish or imitation crab, neither of which I am a fan of.  It gets very loud in there, but they have plenty of televisions broadcasting sports which keeps the hubs happy.

It's weird that they choose to serve beer in a plastic "glass". The food is good. Not great. But here's a pro tip for ya- add an egg on the crispy chicken sammie!

Second trip in: The fried fish sandwich is delish and ask for a side of the fermented jalapeño sauce. It makes everything it touches AMAZING!

Fantastic pizza and you can't beat the lunch special (2 slices and a drink for $5). The slices are huge and FULL of flavor! I took home a menu so we can take advantage of the other specials and specialty pizza selections for a go-to dinner.

So many glorious flavors. And they really are all glorious. AND they have special flavors of the month to switch things up every month. You get more for your money here (we are officially Gelato Spots defectors) Every single person that works here is so genuinely kind and even will bring out water and remind all the patrons to stay hydrated.

I left my baby, Duncan, there for the weekend and boy did he have a great time! I loved watching their Facebook page for photos and videos. They were very attentive with his behavior and needs (he's a bit of a shy guy sometimes and definitely has some confidence issues...) Mirna made check in incredibly easy. Same with checkout- The gal that helped me had a very specific report for me since she had a chance to spend a lot of time with him. And he didn't come home smelling like a dirty dog park like he has coming home from other boarding places. They don't have a bunch of hidden fees and extras that they try to tack on. I actually found them through Groupon and honored the Groupon special without me having to purchase it (Groupon takes a huge chunk fee out of what you pay for it) I cannot wait to keep bringing him back for day care play dates. I actually think he is disappointed to be home with humans instead of surrounded by dogs! So worth the price even without any specialty coupons.

I wish I could buy everything in this store. They have the most amazing housewares for your own home, or to give as gifts. The owners are so sweet and very helpful.

Love their sandwiches and salads. Super fast, convenient, and FRIENDLY! Also, the store had a huge selection of things you may need to pick up, from candy bars to dish soap.... And Icees :)
