I've been frequenting Pizza By Napoli since being first introduced to them by my wife some 20 years ago, and I must say that hands down, there is no other pizza joint that meets the measure of quality in their food preparation.  As soon as you walk in the door you are greeted with a hearty "hey buddy" and a request to take your order. That, in and of itself, provides the kind of feel good atmosphere that my family enjoys. Couple that with the time frame in which it takes to put out your order and you leave feeling as though you have made a group of friends for life.  From the steak, cheese, and onion subs to the meatball calzones, and last, but certainly not least, the family favorites - large sausage, onion, and cheese, and extra cheese pies - these fine gentlemen have always surpassed our expectations.  Over time, some of the faces have changed, but by and large it is the same group of men (and in some instances, women) who have taken care of us.   Pizza By Napoli will always be our go to pizza joint, as - from our experience - there has been no other that can compete with them.

Being an avid music fan, I've been to many venues in the Phoenix area over the years. Once hailed as the Red River Opry - a venue that provided Branson like country music fair - it exchanged ownership and brought in a plethora of national and local music acts.   A patron for some years, I've seen several concerts at this venue, and aside from the occasional out of hand drunk or the one off fights that break out, I thoroughly enjoy myself every time I walk through their doors.  Up close and personal doesn't begin to describe the vibe of The Marquee Theater. There is a never a bad place to watch the show, and if you keep your eyes peeled, you may encounter one of your favorite musicians milling about watching the other acts or at the merchandise booth signing autographs and taking pictures.

My wife I stayed at New York New York for three nights in May 2016, and must say we has the ABSOLUTE best time ever! Not only was the hotel staff courteous and helpful, they went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant as possible. From the moment we walked through the doors, it felt like we had flown from Arizona to the Wonderful Land of Oz.   From the Bar at Time's Square and the sizeable gaming floor, to the many restaurants, it was a virtual playground for the young and young at heart. Everywhere you turned, the atmosphere was filled with electricity.  We stayed in the Park Avenue room and I must admit, I had never slept as comfortable in a hotel as I did there. The ONLY downfall was the night the B-52's held a private concert outside below our 33rd floor room. Loud doesn't begin to describe the vibe as we were trying to rest. But then again...it is Las Vegas, right? You don't go there to rest (much).   I would highly recommend to anyone a stay in New York New York. Generally speaking, you won't regret it - that is unless you are of the mindset that this is a place to tuck yourself away for a few nights. For that, I suggest the Comfort Inn Suites somewhere far removed from the strip location.

Loved, loved, loved The Bar at Time's Square. The ambiance. The comradere. The $15 cover charge...all well worth our time, as well as an amazing experience by what appeared to be all of the patrons of the Tuesday night crowd spent with dueling pianos.   Despite what the naysayers are chiming off about, this was one of the highlights of our entire trip. Singing along to the many song favorites while meeting new friends from near and far made the experience that much more enjoyable. If you are going there expecting a relaxing atmosphere filled with smooth jazz and martini's, you have clearly picked the wrong place. The Bar at Time's Square is a loud and raucous place packed with party goers and song lovers of all ages. If you don't like to sing...this is NOT the place for you. If you are interested in quiet, meaningful conversation...again, not for you. But if you want to have a great time. I highly suggest you join the masses and walk on the wild side. You won't soon forget it.

Having used the blue Super Shuttle van in the past, multiple stops and being crushed and crammed with wheezy, sneezy, hacking, and gacking patrons from around the valley of the sun is something we decided we would never do again.  That said, for a few extra dollars, my wife and I have decided to utilize Super Shuttle's executive car as a means of traveling to, and from, the airport. Not only is it a more comfortable and spacious ride, but the drivers have been early, and there are no stops prior to reaching our chosen destination.   The drivers we have encountered thus far have been friendly and courteous, as well as conversationalists who keep things light (unlike another source once used while on vacation.) The gratuity is paid for in advance when booking the vehicle, so there is no need to pay according to service rendered or bags handled.  If we were traveling in a large group, for the money and space required, I would recommend the blue shuttle van, otherwise, for the hassle and inconvenience involved, I highly recommend the executive car as a pleasant exchange.

What a freak show the Fremont Street Experience turned out to be.  Very much looking forward to a stop there during our recent stay in Las Vegas, we were sadly disappointed to find street freaks, half nude women (and men), the homeless begging for money, and worn down casinos.   FYI: A word to the wise, if you have young children, this NOT the place for them to be. TRUST ME!  What was more troublesome was the fact that everywhere you turned, sideshow street workers were in your face, all but forcing you to stop in order to hear their spiel about the gadgets they were hacking. The only way to stop it from happening was to sink to their level and become just as rude as they are.  Very disappointing.  What once was the talk of the town, Fremont Street has become nothing short of a hodge podge of sub-culture look-a-likes stabbing terribly at their feeble attempts to bring back Michael Jackson, Elvis, and Kiss (yes there was even a Gene Simmons wanna be hunched over in a scooter.)  While I understand that all of the concerts, zip lines, and light shows are in place to attract the upper strip crowds, it does nothing for my wife and I. We are currently planning another stay in Las Vegas and have both decided to stay well enough away from there.

I have had service on my Xterra twice now, and I must say that dealing with Ben and Bruce regarding my repair needs has been a pleasure. Not only did they expiditiously perform my repairs, they pointed out additional issues that I should consider repairing in the future. Superb customer service, and fast quality workmanship have been key and I appreciate everything they have done.

As the newest location, one is led to think that the nice, modern decor and friendly atmosphere are up to par with their flagship restaurant located on I-17 and Cactus, however, after having experiencing one dine-in with my family, it quickly became apparent that the phony smiles were merely a rouse for an over compensating and all too eager to get you out of their restaurant staff.  From the moment we sat down we felt rushed.  We had very little time to decide on drinks, never mind browsing the fairly large menu for what we all wanted to order. It was only after shooing away the waitress four times that we were able to reach a decision as to what we wanted to eat and placed our order.  After what felt like an eternity waiting for or order to be prepared, my now starving family was brought a single plate of egg rolls, later to be followed by another single plate of pot stickers. At this point we are beginning to see how we are to expect dinner - plate by plate rather than in one complete order. This went on through out the remainder of our dinner, to include the waitress forgetting an entire item we had ordered only to laugh it off and blame it on her ink pen. Yes. You read right. Her. Ink. Pen.  The food was no where near as good as it's predecessor on Cactus and I-17, and the wait staff left a great deal to be desired.  A few bones found in the sweet and sour pork, dirty stem ware, my wife tripping over a hole in the floor near our table and we FINALLY receive the check and concluded we won't be revisiting that location any time soon.  The ONLY thing pleasing about this experience was the 15% coupon found on their website.

I've brought both of my vehicles to this particular location (primarily due to convenience) and found that on both occasions I was treated fairly with regard to price and that the front desk staff were courteous and knowledgeable when asked questions regarding repairs, symptoms, etc.  What had been a random visit because of location soon turned me into a loyal patron. Thank you for your honesty and quality service.

I know, I know, I know.  I know what you're thinking: a "Buy here, pay here" auto dealership. There can't be anything positive to say about what they are peddling, right? Wrong. You're absolutely, 100% wrong.  Our oldest was in desperate need of his own vehicle and as a direct result looked to Cactus Jack's as, well...really...a last resort in the auto buying market. Not because he had mixed emotions about the notion of it being a buy here, pay here, rather because he was unsure as to whether he would be able to get a conventional loan from another dealership with minimal to no credit.  He did his research, found a couple of vehicles he somewhat liked, and after looking at them at their current location wasn't entirely sold on either of them. That said, he asked if we could go to the location on West Bell Road in Surprise. I willing drove him out there and we browsed the parking lot for a little while before we met up with their sales person. He asked the routine questions about price range, payments, etc. to get a better feel for where our son was financially. After viewing a couple of cars he showed our son he opted to introduce him to a vehicle that, for two hundred dollars more down, would do well for our son's purposes.  No haggling, No nonsense. Just straight talk and our son was sold.   Our son took it for a test drive and absolutely loved it. Thought it would be perfect for his needs and opted to spend the additional money to take the leap. An hour and a half later, he was driving off of the lot in a shiny 2009 Kia Rio.   I would recommend this dealership to anyone who is struggling with financial restraints and finds difficulty in getting a traditional auto loan. They are fast, honest, efficient and friendly.

I've been a follower, as well as a patron of the owners of Om Ink Gallery for quite some time now and have traveled to all corners of the valley to have work done by Duane Rhoades. A class act and overall great guy, he captures your tattoo ideas well and manages to deliver them in a way that not only keeps you satisfied but finds you wanting more of his work.   I am excited to see that they have opened Om Ink Gallery and expect great things from them. If you get the chance, stop by and see them. Entrust them with you ideas and watch as they come to fruition.

Our oldest came from home work one evening and absolutely raved about this place so, seeing how we are always looking for something fresh and new in the West Valley, naturally my wife, daughter and I thought it might be a restaurant worth looking into.  High priced doesn't begin to describe this place. Over priced is more like it. At a whopping $15.00 a sub (most subs are, on average, between $13.00 - $15.00 for a large) the amount of meat to vegetables and bread ratio is ridiculous. First off, the dressings they use are hardly existent. Couple that with the staples of the sandwich and for the price you would expect a healthy serving of the meats of your choice. Instead you get freshly shaved smatterings of both meat and cheese, and when it comes to the vegetables you almost have to beg for additional lettuce, tomato and pickle. The bread itself appeared flat and overcooked, and unlike it's competitors in the sub sandwich market, fell short of being light and full.  The one and ONLY thing I can say that was a positive regarding my visit was that having chatted up the General Manager as he made our four sandwiches, he appeared to be a genuinely nice person - someone easy to get along with, friendly and courteous.  As for the Jersey Mike's Subs experience as a whole...let's just say for my money I will not be going back any time soon.

Knowing my wife, and the fact that she loves Mediterranean cuisine, I was excited to learn that Avondale, Arizona is playing host to Zeta's Grill.   Having moved to West Phoenix in 2008, it has been quite some time since we have been able to enjoy a restaurant that prides itself on authentic flavors, as well as solid customer service. Zeta's Grill has both.  We arrived in time for lunch and were seated immediately. Our server was attentive and quick to refill our drinks, and she was patient in allowing us to fully view the menu - although we had done so online and had a fairly good idea as to what we were interested in. Our order was prepared quickly and delivered to our table in a timely manner, and we were pleased to see that along with her other customers, we were not made to feel unimportant. Everyone received the same type of courteous and timely service from the young woman.   Upon completion of our meal, we were provided with the check, which I must readily admit was a little pricey for lunch. None the less, we felt that given the nature of the cuisine, and the service provided, it was worth the additional money we could have save by going elsewhere.  As a whole, we were satisfied with our meals, the atmosphere and the courtesy Zeta's Grill provided. While we agree it is not a weekly hot spot for us, we will definitely partake of their cuisine again.  **One side note: the website leaves a great deal to be desired as most of the page links are defunct and unable to access. That said, if you are interested in trying authentic Mediterranean cuisine, Zeta's Grill is a great place to experience.

OK...so I've read the reviews, complaints, and compliments given to Chronic Taco, and - based on my experience today - would have to say that hands down, Chronic Taco has its competitors beat.  Not only was the staff friendly, they were quite helpful when - as a new patron of their establishment - it came to me placing my order, answering all of my questions, and recommending particular favorites they have tried.  The portions were quite generous, and, despite previous reports to the contrary, were heated accordingly.  While similar in nature to its competitor's menu, Chronic Taco's flavor choices were right on the mark - savory, and full of favorable spices and herbs. There was enough heat in the food combination to provide excellent flavors, yet it strayed from being offensive to the pallet.   If you're looking for something quick that will satisfy your appetite, I highly recommend trying this restaurant. You will not be disappointed.
