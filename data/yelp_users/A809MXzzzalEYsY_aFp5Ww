Worst customer service ever! Horrible attitudes and don't keep their promises. Don't order your appliances from Home depot if your getting them delivered from this company!!

Best wings ever! Love how they treat customers. Always great service expecially from the bartender. Never keeps us waiting and always on top of things. Waitresses are amazing and go out of their way just to put on the game you wanna see. Def highly recommend and if you go on the discounted wing days shoot your really getting a good deal!

Amazing place to eat!! great wings, great bartender, and wonderful waitresses. Go out of their way to put on the games you want, respectful and always aware if my glasses getting empty. Bartender is absolutely the best. Always has my food ready fast and always makes sure I'm happy with my drink. Def best place for wings and a good time with friends and family
