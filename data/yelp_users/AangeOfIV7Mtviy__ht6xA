Prime rib was fantastic, calamari was also very good, my friend had ribs and a salad, the meat was flavorful but not fall off the bone. Price point is a little high but i wouldn't hesitate going again.   no tank tops

Went in today with a yelp deal on my phone. They would only except printed deals. Even though i had a conformation number. Food is average at best. Probably won't go back.

John did a fantastic job on figuring out my overheating issue on my Infiniti after Grelichs failed to fix my car properly. John is more than fair with there pricing and are extremely knowledgeable. He has a customer for life from me.

The food was great, i would highly recommend the carnitas burrito. I plan on going back and trying the taco salad.

I had a very poor experience here. My car was over heating and had to get it towed in to the nearest repair shop. I dealt with Cliff and explained to him of the problems and concern. They charged me over a thousand dollars to replace a radiator thermostat and hoses. They over charged me about an hour and a half on labor and failed to fix the problem. Then stating i blew a head gasket. I then towed my car out to another shop. MILE AUTO REPAIR in Tempe and they found that they didn't properly bleed the cooling system. I will never go to Greulichs again. They don't know what they are doing over there.
