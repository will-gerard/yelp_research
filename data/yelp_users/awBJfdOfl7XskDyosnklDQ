Misdiagnosed the problem. Didn't even seem to want to fix it. Dukes was much more professional, fixed the correct problem and even gave better pricing for the blower motor, which wasn't even broken.  The worst part is that I know the ac guys tech most likely had a generic relay in his van. And even if he didn't, I'm sure hq has them in stock. We went three days without ac because of the holiday, waiting for a shop to buy a motor from.

Rick came out within the appointed time and fixed the dryer. Nice guy, straight shooter, no complaints.

The owner Cody is a cool guy. Plus this is the only meadery within 100 miles or so. I mean, it serves alcohol, it tastes good, what more could you ask for? Service is quick, prices are fair. No complaints here.
