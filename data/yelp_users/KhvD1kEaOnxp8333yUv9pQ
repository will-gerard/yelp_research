As my first meal in Vegas, I was pleasantly surprised with Circo!  The menu has very little for vegetarians, and nothing for vegans, so I asked the waiter if he had any suggestions.  He suggested an eggless spaghetti with fresh tomato sauce and basil, and I was sold.  It was light, flavorful, and satisfying.  I was so grateful for the waiter's knowledge, and how kind he was to me!  He knew I wouldn't be able to share in the appetizers everyone else ordered so he brought my food out sooner (awww!) and he made sure I had a comfortable and delicious meal.  Even though my dish was simple, I felt spoiled rotten.  Thank you for accommodating me, Circo!!

I came here with my in-laws who were visiting from India and were so freakin' tired of pasta, raw vegetables, and cheese.  Oh, America.  I tried to tempt them with Japanese food at Mizumi but raw fish wasn't up their alley, either.  We stumbled across Red 8 and their eyes lit up.  Pan-Asian, it was!  As a vegan, I was absolutely delighted to be dining at a Wynn restaurant, knowing there would absolutely be delicious food for me to eat.  I started with a soy Thai Iced Tea and I nearly lost my mind, it was so good.  I ordered two vegan dim sums, the white lotus and jade dumplings, at the waitress' suggestion.  I don't remember what's actually in them (spinach?  mushrooms?) but they were both fantastic.  For my main, I had the Vegan Tofu Shiitake.  It was okay, but a little boring!  We had some hot chili paste with the dumplings so I liberally spooned that over my food to give it some oomph.  Even boring tofu and mushrooms can still hit the spot, and I left quite full.  My in-laws loved their food and everyone had a great meal.  The prices are exorbitant but nothing worse than any place else in the area.  Next time I'm in the area and craving something similar, I think I'll have to check out Wazuzu.  Similar menu, but more vegan options (including sushi!).

Sometimes, on a Saturday afternoon, my husband will whisper to me, "You know, if we leave now....we could be having brunch at the Wynn by tomorrow morning."  Don't tempt me!!!  Oh, he knows my weakness for hearty vegan brunches.  Terrace Pointe Cafe pulls out all the stops, and I had to resist ordering more than one entree.  I had the french toast that is, to date, the best french toast I've ever had.  I was a little wary that the batter had banana in it (such a hippie thing to do) but it worked!  After a few bites, I didn't even really taste the fruit, and was left with a perfect interpretation of eggy french toast, without the sadness.  Well done, Terrace Pointe!  I had originally made reservations for Tableau, but when the rest of our party dropped out at the last minute, and there were no reservations available for two people, we rolled the dice with Terrace Pointe and were so delighted.  We were seated within 10 minutes, without a reservation, and had a lovely seat by the window.  The attire for the wait staff is a little too "Disneyland, Carnation Cafe," but I suppose they're just trying to create an atmosphere.  5 stars for the best french toast.  I'll probably be back for more soon.

Not going to lie, this place is way too expensive for me, but if someone else is paying the bill..... count me in!  This gorgeous restaurant in the Bellagio is the most vegan-friendly establishment in the hotel, and they really feed you well.  I was tempted by the tofu "scallops" and they did not disappoint. Great, light flavors, and it was easily the healthiest and most satisfying meal I had my entire trip. Service was impeccable, the wine was lovely, and the atmosphere was so cool. I loved the open kitchen and water features throughout the restaurant.  Make sure to talk to your server if you have any dietary needs! They have a separate vegetarian menu with lots of vegan options, and the server will happily steer you towards a good choice.

Umm...I got front and center for the fountains that danced to Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" and I might've squealed like I was 13 again.  Sam epically rolled his eyes but MY HEART WILL GO OOOOOON AND OOOOOOOOOOOON.  So cool, and definitely worth staking out a spot.

I hit up Nami twice while in Arizona - once for a famed tsoynami (a vegan twist on a Dairy Queen blizzard), second time for breakfast.  It's such a great gem in the desert, and I love that it's right by where my only friend in the area lives, haha.  The second I started crossing through Phoenix (after 7 hours on the road!), I found my way to Nami to get a cookies and cream tsoynami.  It's a cute little bungalow with way more parking than I anticipated - except this place is popular so it's still not enough, haha.  Everyone working there is so sweet and upbeat, you can't help but be in a good mood, too.  I got my treat and headed to my final destination in Scottsdale.  I found the vanilla soft serve base really disappointing.  It was really icy and melted almost instantly.  It's not the creamy, thick base of blizzards or McFlurries I remember at all.  But it was cold, and I was hot, at the cookie bits throughout were perfect.  I was determined to give them another try on my way out of Phoenix, to grab breakfast before my journey home.  This time, I went with a caramel "mockiato" and a McBagel Sandwich.  10 outta 10, on both counts!  The mockiato was a dead ringer for my former favorite at Starbucks, with a little whipped cream and everything!  I'll be real, my sweet tooth has subsided these past few years (maybe thanks to veganism?!), but this was such a treat and the perfect trip down memory lane.  I also looooooved the McBagel Sandwich.  I've got a soft spot for breakfast sandwiches and this was one of the best I've had.  Fried eggy tofu, veg ham, cheddar daiya (I think?),  and spicy aioli on a bagel tasted like something out of my LA favorite, locali, except fully loaded.  I headed on the road to California right after, and didn't need to stop for food the whole way.  That's impressive!  I'd definitely come back here when I'm in the area!  They have so many vegan goodies, that even if the tsoynamis don't impress me, I will not leave empty handed (uhhh s'mores bars and twinkies, anybody?).

When we were making last minute plans to take my cousins to Vegas, I prayed and I hoped that we could find an affordable room at the Wynn (vegan paradise!), but with the cheapest clocking in at $900/night (*SOB*), it just wasn't going to happen this time.  So we booked at the Mandalay, knowing there'd at least be the best pool in the world to soothe the pain of not being at the Wynn.  What I didn't know was that there'd also be Slice of Vegas to make me SO SO happy!  It's a casual Italian eatery, and coming from the suburbs of Philly, I felt right at home.  Nothing fancy, not too much hoopla, just standard American-Italian fare that fills your belly with a warm light (and maybe acid reflux) that you'll carry with you for the rest of the day.  This, my friends, is comfort food.  What sets Slice of Vegas apart from the pizza joints of my youth is their amazing vegan menu!  Not even kidding you, it has everything you could possibly ever want at a place like this.  Pizza, pasta, salads (really? you're eating a salad?), appetizers, sandwiches, DESSERTS.....oh lordy, they thought of everything.  They left no stone unturned.  I was lured by the meatball sandwich, and went high to hog heaven with the first bite.  A great roll (they even call it a hoagie roll, like my people back east!!), a rich balanced sauce, the perfect amount of daiya mozzarella, and gardein meatballs, which are probably my favorite outside of homemade.  It came with sweet potato fries, and our darling waitress said the magic words, "Would you like a side of ranch with that?"  WOULD I?!  Gimme gimme gimme.  Sam was perfectly content with his spaghetti and spicy marinara, and would've come back for it every meal if I'd let him.  We stuffed ourselves silly and had no room for dessert, which was the saddest thing.  I even tried to come back later after a night of dancing, but they were long closed.  Alas, I can add this place to my repertoire of super vegan friendly restaurants in Vegas, and I'm very happy that I don't absolutely have to go to the Wynn to be well fed (to the point of bursting).

Addendum: The owner contacted me to let me know this server no longer works at Hula's, and didn't represent their standard of service.  Based on the owner's willingness to communicate with me and make amends, I'd be open to returning next time I'm in Scottsdale, and hopefully will be able to update my rating!  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Hi!  I'm vegan.  I try not to make a fuss when I eat out with friends, but Hula's made it difficult.  I've never met a more exasperated waitress in my entire life.  It started off fine enough.  "Are your hashbrowns made with butter or oil?"  "Butter."  "And they can't be made with oil?"  "No."  "Okay, I'll have avocado and toast."  I got avocado and a buttered English muffin.  Two things - thought it was pretty clear based on our previous conversation that I'm not into butter, but also..."I'm sorry," I said.  "I can't eat English muffins.  Do you have toast, like sourdough or something?"  Siiiigh, sure, okay.  "Sorry," I called after her.  All of my friends turned towards me.  "Why are you apologizing?!"  "I don't know...reflex?  She looks annoyed with me?"  Then when she came back and said the toast would be coming up, I clarified that I didn't want butter on the toast, remembering the English muffin situation.  She stopped in her tracks, sighed, and then went to the kitchen, without saying a word to me.  Oh...wow.  What I got was Texas toast ("no butter!") grilled where they grill buttered Texas toast.  Okay, I'm done.  I almost ate it anyways, but the smell of butter and the hardness of the avocado stopped me.  "It's not worth it, dude," I said to myself, nauseated by the smell.  Had I made it clear I was vegan, it might've been a different story.  I was trying to be easy (avocado and toast are usually so fail-safe!) but it just didn't work this time.  I have zero complaints about the $2 mimosas, and they do have a clearly marked vegan option on their dinner menu.  Both the English muffin and Texas toast were removed from my bill, so props to at least being aware that I was unhappy.  But the situation was bad enough that none of my friends wanted to go back, even though they all had great food.  I have pretty awesome friends.
