I visited the convention center as part of the expo for the Rock N Roll marathon/half marathon and this review sprawls across both of these entities.  As for the convention center, it's certainly in the upper half of "Convention Centers I have known". The rooms are spacious and it's easy to get up and down floors. The design is nice with easy access to the stairs and escalators and they have the exit-only designs that are conveniently located. It may not be the greatest endorsement when I say that the convention center can be quickly exited, but I appreciated these benefits.  The Rock N Roll expo was also reasonable: they have a similar set up at all their races and the number and scope of vendors is impressive. Now, I've always considered these things the equivalent of runners' porn and typically try to get out as quickly as possible. It only takes a momentary distraction to have you stop in front of a stall and decide that you must have the new Saucony socks ("But these are ULTRA wicking!")  I've taken the Jason Bourne in an embassy in Switzerland approach: when you walk in the entrance, you put your earpiece in, rip the diagram of the building off the wall, analyze the quickest route between the points you need to go and then march. This typically works fairly well and you can navigate through the whole affair in a few minutes. Not too shabby.  A friend of mine has a different philosophy. He claims that you want to take the more circuitous route through the hall since people tend to congregate in the center of the place. He probably has a point (although I'll never admit that to him): there's actually a hierarchy of vendors and the less desirable ones tend to get stuck along the back walls. When you navigate this path, the crowds are sparser and the vendors are listlessly standing next to stalls of "Used Running Socks" and "Backwash Gatorade". I tried this manuever at the Phoenix expo and found that I could exit the building a little faster. An idea to try the next time you're at one of these things......

The Desert Botanical Garden is a wonderful place to while away a few hours. I'd wandered by after a race and was looking for a calm activity that would stretch my legs. And this choice turned out to be perfect.  The Gardens are a mix of several different trails, each with a different theme: these range from a trail based on lifestyles of the ancient Sonoran Desert dwellers to a path based on desert wildflowers. Each path is a mixture of different desert plants mixed with educational exhibits. Highlighting the flowers are various sun-seared rock formations and distant mountains.  It's a very easy trail which is well marked; you won't get lost in the desert. A visit around sunset is also worth considering: the mix of light and shadows adds an extra dimension to the surroundings. The outer trails do close after sunset, although the inner path (The Desert Discovery Loop Trail) is lighted and remains open.  They do rent this facility out and I think it would be wonderful for catered events, weddings and the like. The Gardens definitely are a jewel for the Phoenix area.

Skyharbor is one of my favorite airports. Not so much that I love spending a lot of time here, but in the fact that it gets me to where I want to go with less hassle than other places. In fact, in 2009, it ranked 3rd in the nation in on-time arrivals and 11th in on-time departures (out of the 31 major US airports).  I tend to fly through Skyharbor a lot for someone who lives in the Northwest corner of the country. Some of this is due to my strategy of only connecting through warm-weather airports during the winter. This tends to avoid the episodes of being out on the tarmac and having the captain announce: "We're going to wait here a few minutes because I think we could use a second coat of de-icer." Or being delayed by freak snowstorms. Or icestorms. I've got a second correlary to this which reads about not connecting through coastal airports during hurricane season, but that's not really relevant for this review...  Anyways, I'm going with four stars since this is the first time I've dealt with the check-in routine at Skyharbor. I have two minor complaints: the first is the actual check-in and the second was security.  As for the check-in, it could just be an airline thing, but I saw this at several counters. They have the echeck-in booths, but were having people with luggage and carry-on both using these things with only a few counter people. What this does is make everyone wait while the (overworked) counter person tries to run around and check everyones' luggage in. I guess I'm used to having separate lines for those of us with carry-on only. Waiting in line behind the guys and girls with eight suitcases sort of defeats the purpose of travelling light (at least in this sense).  The second complaint is security. Hardly a new complaint, but it seems a bit tighter here than at most other airports I've been through. In the x-ray line, the person working the machine was very slow and was calling for a bag check on every other person. I considered even jumping into another line to see if it improved, but figured that might be considered suspicious behavoir and get pulled out for some sort of horrific interrogation (*light shining in my face as a person in the shadows asks questions* "Doug C., I couldn't help but notice that you had a receipt from Taco Bell in your luggage." *slams fists on counter* "ARE YOU A MEXICAN SPY? DO YOU WORK FOR THE FEDERALES?")  As it turns out, staying in line didn't really work much better. Despite not setting off the alarm on the walk through, I got pulled aside for a pat-down. (And, yes, I have been working out. Thanks for noticing buddy.) Then the x-ray watcher stopped my bags to have them inspect the fluids that were clearly dangerous*. But after listening to a lecture and promising to floss three times a day, I was finally allowed to leave and exit for my flight.  I only have one experience with this, but I guess I could sum it up with: nice airport, but arrive early.  -----------------  *As shown in the equation: 1/2 sample tube crest + 1 oz. Pert shampoo = Pl-239

Jobing.com Arena is unlikely to ever be named as one of the Wonders of the World (or even the most cleverly named venue), but it's a great destination to catch a sporting event.  It's conveniently located near the freeway and has abundant parking near the arena. They advertise $10 parking which seemed to be a bargain for most sporting events, but when I got here I found out that they have large free lots right across the street. Free parking? I can't even park on the street for free these days.   Access to the stadium is easy and there's even a few shops around one side of the place (think mall food court on steroids). Inside they have a healthy dose of vendors along the walkways which are conveniently located. The seats are fantastic: even the $15 upper level seats have a nice view of the action. With the free parking and reasonable seat prices, you'll definitely spend more on concessions here.

I guess the highest positive I can give is that the Sands Convention Center has a lot of space. Then again, so does the Sahara.  In terms of being able to set up a convention, sure, there's plenty of room, adequate lighting is available and the temperature can be controlled. It's nice since you're next to a number of casinos so that there are a number of activities for conventioneers.   However, it's hard to really recommend because the signage and layout seems haphazard and it's a little difficult to get around. As another minus, I happened to wander here from a ground street only to be told that people could only enter through the Venetian. (Thus requiring an extra 10 minutes of wandering around only to be "let" in)   Just doesn't seem visitor friendly......which is a minus for a convention center.

Along one end of the Luxor in the center casino area is the Pyramid Cafe. It's mostly a small area raised a few feet off the pyramid floor. There aren't really walls, so it does give you a view of weary, ragged-around-the-edges folks mindlessly working the slots at 3 am.  There's a fairly broad menu ranging from burgers to 24 hour breakfast. Out of sheer convenience, I ate here twice; once a breakfast type meal and the other dinner. Although different foods, the experience was similar.  Both times service was pretty slow, even when the place was only partly full and the number of patrons barely outnumbered the servers. Breakfast came with a nice helping of ham but runny eggs and wilted hash browns. A burger for dinner was okay; I rather liked the fries that came with it, but it was a pretty small helping. Prices had the expected resort markup.  I give two stars here, not that it's a particularly bad place, but it just seems to do everything a little below average. There's nothing egregious here and I'd eat here again in the right circumstances, but everything is sort of a C-/D+ level. I'd say that this is best for a basic meal if you're in the Luxor area or for a 4 am chowdown after a night on the town.

Swinging through here during a march through Old Scottsdale, it seemed like the perfect place to pick up a quick desert.   As for the desert itself, that was acceptible: a brownie with ice cream on top. Nothing too exotic, but I thought that the brownie itself would be worth three stars.  But lousy service drops this to two stars. It took a while to find a waiter and the one that I did was pretty bad. Despite there only being a few people here, it took a pretty long time for him to swing by for an order (15? 20 minutes?). When he did, in the middle of the order, he got distracted by one of his buddies who showed up and he wandered away. He actually only came back to deliver the bill; another server actually noticed his wandering and came by to apologize and take the order.  I'd consider giving one star, but the food is respectible. Thus the average of one star service and three star food quality makes two. Realize that I'm considering the service one star based on a single server; other patrons, hopefully, may have a better experience if they got someone else.

I wonder about restaurants named after cities. Is it considered a slight against the food in the transplant city? Is Boston's saying: "People of Phoenix, your food is so non-descript that we're bringing in the menu based on a city whose Irish-American citizens are most famous for eating potatoes." Or does it really matter more which city it is? So if a restaurant opened up that called itself "San Francisco's", it might not be that much of a snub? As opposed to a place called Detroit's ("Featuring cuisine inspired by the people of the Motor City"), it would be a civic smack in the face?  An important question. But since I'm not a Phoenix native, I had no skin in this game and felt it was fair to visit Boston's to dine. It's billed as a pizza place, but really this has the feel of a sports bar. And not a bad one, I should add. There is a really wide area of large tables set out in front of the bar with a number of big screen TVs for your convenient viewing pleasure. I also liked that they had a number of high tables; there's far too many tiny seats these days that make you feel like you're low-rider dining.  The interior design is a bit generic: the comparisons to Applebee's or Chili's are fair. There is room for an upgrade here. Since this is more of a sports bar, some memorabilia could help; maybe Kurt Warner can donate a jersey. Or better yet, now that he's retired, perhaps they could employ Kurt Warner as a greeter.  The tabletops have a number of coasters with questions on them that range from "Hottest Actress" to "Best City". Apparently designed to provoke a generic discussion on an awkward date, I felt that the "Best City" coaster was a bit of a trick question: is the correct answer Boston or Phoenix? Or should I just say screw it and go with Seattle? (TAKE THAT PORTLAND! YOU'RE NOT EVEN ONE OF THE CHOICES!) Anyways, conversation starters if you're desperate.  And speaking of starters, I went with an appetizer: the Southwest Ravioli. It's a ravioli (no false advertising here) stuffed with cheese (Monterrey Jack and cheddar) with jalapeno peppers and ranch dipping sauce. It was greasy and decadent. I loved it and even considered ordering a second round.  Instead I went with a main course. Now I know that it's a pizza place, but I'd just finished a half marathon a few hours before and wasn't certain if my stomach was yet up to pizza. So I went with the.....Bacon Cheeseburger. This works well as a stand-alone menu item: it comes with cheddar and mozzarella (I love the cheese emphasis at this place, the owner must be a mouse), onions, lettuce and mayo. There may have been tomato also, but I think I disdainfully tossed these away. Regardless, this was a fine burger cooked just right.  Service here was also prompt and my pop refills were frequent and performed without me having to notify them. If I lived in the Phoenix area, I would consider this a nice place to catch a game.

Encanto Park is a pretty good city-center (almost) greenspace for Phoenix. I use the term greenspace loosely, since all the grass was dead when I visited.   Besides the groundskeeping issue, there are a number of nice options here. There's a few paths for strolling, a small lake/lagoon for boat riding, as well as an adjacent golf course and tennis courts. In addition, there's a small amusement park with a train ride for kiddies and even a carousel.   Although I didn't jump on the carousel horses or other rides, the amusement park seemed entertaining (in the way that an adult can guess what might seem interesting to a kid). I would also mention that they have a small old school arcade at the side of the park. I almost kept on walking, until I saw that one of the games was PunchOut. Since I spent a small fortune playing this in younger days, I stopped to watch someone start playing; only to get quickly knocked out by Glass Joe (the first boxer). I fished in my pocket for a few quarters and smiled. "Hey kid, let me show you a trick or two for this...."

One of the classic stadium destinations in college football.   Since I was here for an event, not a game, I can't really comment on the sightlines or seating. However, it is one of the few recognizable sights: situated between two mountains, panoramic shots of the stadium will be frequently shown on TV and the stadium is easily visible entering Phoenix airspace. Since it's only a few miles from the airport, you get a nice close-up on approach.  Although they have apparent pay lots, event parking here was free which I greatly appreciated. As a bonus, there are a few different ways in and out of the area, so there wasn't much of a traffic jam after the event.

The Rock N Roll Marathon series has fourteen races in their tour and Arizona is the first in their schedule. I've done three of the races in their series and all of them are very organized and are recommended for pretty much any type of runner: they have prize money for the hardcore people at the front and plenty of entertainment for the novice runner.  Logistics: The start line is in downtown Phoenix and ends in Tempe for both the marathon and half marathon (the full marathon has a larger loop in North Phoenix and runs through Scottsdale). There were no shuttles to the start after the race and they recommended parking at the finish line before the race (they did have shuttles to the start before the race). The shuttles were very efficient and they had a number of extra buses: I didn't see long lines or people waiting (although I arrived two hours before the start) as I have in some races.   They also stagger the start with people placed in corrals based on their expected finish time. This works pretty well, especially for races that attract 30,000 or so people. I was in Corral 2 and it was still fairly crowded along the course, I can only imagine the chaos if it wasn't staggered.   Water stations were liberally sprinkled throughout the course and cheer groups and bands were also about every mile: there were a few less bands than what I've seen at San Antonio and Virginia Beach, but still plentiful enough.  Course: This is the only reason that I'm going with four stars instead of five. In terms of running, it's a pretty easy course: very flat and on pavement. Visually, there isn't too much to recommend it. You're mostly running through light industrial sections of Phoenix and out along the desert. Much of the scenery is therefore foreclosed buildings that give you an idea of how bad Phoenix is hurting in this recession. Understandable, but a more interesting or scenic course would get five stars.  Miscellaneous: For those people thinking of running the race from out of town, I think your best option is probably to stay at a downtown Phoenix hotel. You're right next to the expo and the starting line is a mile or so away. The light rail line also runs by the expo and close to the finish: if you had a one way pass, you could just take it back to the hotel from the finish. Probably the second best option would be to stay in Tempe: there are shuttles to the start and you could take the light rail to the start and expo as well.  Overall, this is a well organized race and makes a great sunny vacation in January.

The naming of Asian themed restaurants is in need of a serious makeover. I think this is the next frontier for marketing gurus; a potential fortune could be made here. Most restaurants fall into the category of being painfully bland ("China Food"), vaguely insulting ethnic caricatures ("Mr. Yings' Happy China Meal") or horrific puns ("Pho Sure"). Names like these don't inspire a lot of confidence in the quality of their food, even though that's not always the case (for example, "China Food" was actually pretty good).  So when I saw Thai Elephant, my mind immediately reversed the name which sounds suspiciously close to a parasitic disease (elephantiasis). Plus the fact that it's located in a strip mall is a bit of a red flag. But a growling stomach can overcome these biases and so I pulled into the lot......  ......And was pleasantly surprised. This is actually pretty good Thai food. The inside is a little more ornate than you would have expected; there's the whitewashed walls that fits the strip mall theme, but the furniture is darker wood with slightly dimmed background lighting. A large screen TV was playing the Suns game in the back room and a small bar is present in the front part of the restaurant. There are a few tables as well as some seats with a mix of wooden booths and chairs.  Still wary, I ordered the hot tea, Thai sweet potatoes and chicken Pad Thai. All of these were above average: the Thai sweet potatoes were perfectly fried and mixed well with the slightly tangy sauce. I may have eaten more than ten times my body weight in Chicken Pad Thai over the years, and this was definitely above average.   Although I was just here for dinner, I did see that they have a Happy Hour which runs from 5-7 pm.   All in all, it's a pleasant place that belies its' strip mall exterior and is worth a visit for respectable Thai food.

If you're wandering through the Venetian, and grow hungry, this is a nice choice for dining at a reasonable price.  While marching through on the way to an expo nearby, I'd stopped in here for an impromptu lunch. The waiter was quick and helpful and my chicken fettucini alfredo appeared soon after ordering. Almost too quick....  But it was tasty and the portions were large. Enough that I didn't need to eat dinner that night. And the price for this gargantuan portion was in the range of $13.   The menu appears expansive and the place is open until 2/3 am (and opens in the morning at 6). If I was staying at the Venetian, I'd see no need to eat anywhere else.

Yogurtland is a chain self-serve frozen yogurt entity. The way it works is simple: you walk in and grab a cup. Next you meander along the wall where they have a variety of yogurt flavors and put whatever ones you want into the cup. As you continue along the line, there are a number of self-serve toppings that you can add into the yogurt. Then you take the cup to the cashier and have it weighed; the price is based on weight.  There's a fairly impressive variety of flavors here and most of them were fat free (and doesn't that mean that it's okay to eat twice as much?). They have a number of toppings that range from healthy mango and kiwi to oreo crumbles and gummi bears.   I actually didn't see the prices marked anywhere, but attached is a picture of the cup I made (don't judge, I like M&M's) which was a little over $5.

The Las Vegas RNR Marathon/Half Marathon is a well executed race. The same people coordinate races in different cities and their experience shows. The expo works smoothly and the race has the appropriate number of water stops, gu, coordinators, etc.  PRE-RACE: The expo is held in the Sands Convention center, which is a bit of a chore to get to, but otherwise is run pretty smoothly. The start and finish line are close to each other near Mandalay Bay. For the out of towner, I'd recommend staying at the south end of the strip.   Although you'd have to travel to the expo (but presumably you're up and about the town anyways), but it's horribly convenient to be able to get up and walk to the starting line. And possibly more importantly, walk to the hotel room after the race. If you're staying in Mandalay Bay (or Luxor and Excalibur since they're connected by tram), you're probably in good shape.  RACE: It's a pretty nice scenic course. There are some races that have rather forgettable scenery (e.g. interstates, endless routes through subdivisions, etc.), but running down the Strip certainly leaves you enough to see. It's basically a flat down and back course going from Mandalay Bay out past the Stratosphere and back. And there's plenty of water, bands, spectators, cheer groups, etc.   Note that this is for the half marathon and the first half of the marathon. I did hear from some of the marathoners that the second half of their course was less exciting. But since that's second hand information, I'll defer that to their Yelp review.  On a personal note, I set a New Years resolution to run a half marathon in a different state every month and so this completes 2010 for me. Please excuse me while I ice my knees for the next week.

At Skyharbor, the car rental agencies have been combined into one gigantic off-site location. They are housed in an opulent palacial estate at the margin of the airport. A number of shuttle buses stand ready at the terminal exits to whisk you away to this monument of temporary automobile ownership.   Suffice it to say, the place is huge. Most rental places that I go to seem to be housed in tin shacks that look like they could double as a mobile home. Considering its' size, I assumed that some sort of politician must have gathered the money to build this edifice: I searched for an Ozymandias-type poem at the entrance, but sadly could not find it.   Yet, the place does run smoothly; from the quick shuttles to the numerous employees at the counter, they will have you off and away in a matter of minutes. I will hand it to Thrifty, they were renting economy cars at a $15/day rate that beat all of their competitors. A rental car for the same price that you may pay for lunch isn't a bad deal. Be wary of the typical mark-ups (e.g. if the tank isn't full, they will charge you over $7/gallon to refill, etc.)  They have all the cars for the different agencies stored on the level below: a mixture of escalators and signs will guide you to the appropriate part of the cavernous storage floor. In the storage area, the staff were housed in small metal shacks ("now that's more like it") but were also quick and efficient. I had the keys to my quasi-stylish Chevy Aveo in moments and was rolling off the ramp onto I-10.   As far as rental return, this is close to as easy as you get. Anywhere within a short distance of the return hall has a blizzard of signs pointing you in the correct direction. There are so many signs that I was looking for a pamphlet that had some sort of bizarre factoid like "more steel was used in the signs to the Skyharbor Rental Return than in the entire Empire State Building" or something of that sort. Again, I could not find such a thing (although I'm convinced it's true).  These signs will guide you back to the rental return floor where you will use the reverse escalators to take you back to the mammoth greeting hall. Shuttles will once again take you back to Skyharbor for your return flight. Now, they have three separate terminals (2,3 and 4) which are both color-coded as well as identified with desert type creatures (e.g. one is "roadrunner" another something like "gecko", etc.). I'm not sure why you'd correlate "roadrunner" with terminal three (or was it four?), but you can always ask the helpful drivers: they know which flights go to which terminals.
