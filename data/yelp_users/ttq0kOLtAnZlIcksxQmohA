I have lived here for over a year. I actually lived here back in 2008 also and decided to move back due of the good experience. I have. It had a problem. The staff is very nice and made sure all my maintenance requests were taken care of. Overall good experience. I gave them a 4 just because parking can be horrible, but nothing that can't be resolved. Other than that, I would recommend this place for single people.

Even though the place looks a little rundown the staff is courteous and the food is delicious. Been coming here for years and love going there. Always a great experience.

This has place a horrible server! He talked back to our table and got an attitude, even though he was the one that forgot to place our order. After letting him know we were disappointed in the service he got an attitude and never came back to out table. Red-head server/bartender.

After the manager read my review he contact me and apologized. I have yet to return to the place, but the manager assured me my experience will be different. Since then the server that served me was terminated. Looking forward to going again.

Went on yelp to find a Pho place near my home. I found this one and decided to try it out judging by the reviews and rating. Let me tell you that I loved the place. Very clean, fresh, and quiet. I was greeted right away and my order was out in a reasonable amount of time. I would return there again. It is a little pricey compared to other PHo places but it was delicious.

Have been to this place many times. Would visit it twice a week. Such a regular that the server already knew my order. Last time I was there I found a worm in my soup. All they did was offer an apology and that's it. Even though I did not even eat half of my food they still made me pay for it. It's unfortunate that the food is good but treatment to loyal customers is so bad.

Been going there since it opened. I now live in Tempe and drive all the way to central Phoenix for a haircut.

I have visited other Petcos in the Phoenix area and have always had a great experience. After taking my pets to get groomed at this location for a couple of times I was not satisfied and would tell the staff about what I was unhappy about. They would then do fix what they did wrong. The last time I called to schedule an appointment I was refused service due to the fact that I was never happy with the service. I was refused service due to the fact that I demand my money's worth. It seemed the heavy set woman was the one that wrote in my file not to service me anymore. Very bad experience.

I have to say that I am very satisfied with the service I am receiving from this place. The food is amazing and the portions are very fulfilling! It's only my first week and I already feel healthier. I am on the accelerator plan and if anyone is looking to lose weight this is the plan to do. I recommend it. It can be a little pricey, but I was honestly spending more eating out.

As soon as I got my first treatment I noticed the difference, but after I got the the peeling my face changed drastically. People would say I had "HD" skin and it made me feel good. All my pictures looked like they had been photoshopped when in fact they had not   Magdalena knows what she is doing and knows what to recommend for your skin. She makes you feel comfortable and very good about the treatment. The prices are very reasonable and you definitely get more than what you pay for.

Originally was going to paradise bakery and decided to stop by here instead. Boy did I regret it! It took 20 minutes to get my food. If you are in a hurry avoid this place.

Had a burrito from here after coworkers recommended it. The owner let me try everything since he knew it was my first time there. I'm definitely now a customer. The green chile pork was good! Great customer service and great food. What more can you ask for.

Had been going to the location in Arcadia for years. I'm so glad they have a location in Gilbert! Now I go there after work. The service is amazing and Liz is great. This place does not disappoint! It will be my new location.
