Horrible experience for a mothers day lunch. They crammed us in a corner where they shoved industrial metal tables with picnic table covers...  Literally sat 32 people in an area they would normally sit 16 people. Way understaffed and over crowded showing they only care about top line sales, not customer service. Probably should call the fire Marshall to see this as I have to keep moving my baby seat whenever the table next to us needs to go to the bathroom. Good news is we have been here 45 minutes and I have not gotten to eat yet...  Guess this is an all day experience today...

Yummy.....  Love the New York Egg rolls and the consistency of the food.  Unfortunately, I have not tried a lot on the menu, but everything so far has been great.

Does a great job for the money!  Even with a black car they do a good job drying and cleaning. Definitely a fan.

Ordered food an hour and 45 minutes ago for delivery, and they don't show up. Call to see what the problem is and they so oh, there was a problem with your food, we are going to remake it. When I ask why they didn't call, they say they were going to. I say forget it, and they don't even care. They may claim that local, family owned makes a difference. I used to think it did, but service is equally important. Unfortunately, Lorenzo hasn't learned that lesson yet and now I have to go get McDonalds for a 2 year old that is two hours late on her dinner.

Troy is a rock star!  He is reliabile and inexpensive, knowing how to complete virtually any task.  I have used him several times on everything from routine maintenance to heavy-duty repairs.  Would strongly recommend calling him for whatever task or project you have in mind.

Troy is a rockstar!  He has helped me with work at my office, personal residence and rental properties.  Sometimes I feel guilty because he charges so much less than others, but I think that is because he does a lot of the work himself, or brings a helper to keep the amount of time down.  Without all of the overhead some of the other companies out there have, probably helps Troy stay so reasonable in his pricing and bids.    I would highly recommend Troy to others and have.  If you need any sort of handyman service from as simple as paint to as detailed as some basic rebuilding or repair, Troy is your Boy!

The worst car wash I have ever had... For $18 I would expect the truck would actually be clean, water would be dried. There is still dirt in bed of truck, back window is covered in water spots and there is still dirt on mirrors. Manager was too busy listening to another complaint for me to bother. Very disappointing as its so close to my work.

This place sucks...  It's really that simple.  The build out is decent, but the staff and bouncers are rude.  Someone needs to tell them they are in North Scottsdale, not LA.  I give it until the summer begins before they are out of business...  Sorry, but it's no tea party.

Unfortunately I am having a very similar problem as Ed R.... Card was charged multiple times for different amounts with no accounting to show why. I have asked numerous times for an accounting of what work has been completed and have not received a response. I have made a final request, but have discovered that work I was being charged for was not actually completed. I was initially very pleased with Tyler, but after talking to a tenant and learning that work was not actually completed (even though I was charged) I am pretty frustrated and worried about fraudulent practices. I was not planning to make a negative review, but after seeing Ed R have basically the same experience, I don't want others to be in the same situation. Beware, and don't pay with a credit card where you can later get false charges... Additionally make sure work is completed, properly.   Formerly very happy Customer, now disappointed I cheated on my good handyman because he was too busy. Guess that's why he was too busy.

I hired Gorilla Builders to complete an extension for my garage.  It was an unusual job as I was adding onto an existing building.  Thus they had to work to match finishes and the existing structure.  I worked with a lot of contractors prior to the hiring of Gorilla and chose them because they are a builder, not just a contractor.  What i mean by that is most of the people on site were employees of Gorilla, not just subs.  They did a great job and I am very pleased with the quality, pricing and service. The project took a pretty long time to complete, but we had many rain delays which is unusual for Arizona and I changed my mind on the original plan.  I would certainly use the Gorilla again for future projects and am confident that they would do a great job.  Special shout out to their concrete team.  They had to do some pretty impressive changes to the grade and design of my driveway.  they warned me in advance how things could go wrong, and the risks in the design.  But, it turned out great at completion.
