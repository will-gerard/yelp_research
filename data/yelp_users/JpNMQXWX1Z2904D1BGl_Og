Finally got to try this place! The decor of the restaurant is definitely casual...very simplistic. Great for grabbing a quick bite. Everything was served extremely fast! Wonderful menu with mostly Asian influence. Huge portions, and the veggie meat was quite tasty. We ordered the spring rolls, the pad thai and the NY charm. I absolutely loved the ny charm, and the pad thai was ok.  I WILL be back to try some more of their meatless creations!

All around great cleaners, a little pricey, but you can find coupons if you look for some. Consistently well pressed shirts, easy bag drop system, great hours and their turn around time is usually about 1 day. They are right in the same area as Arcadia tavern, so getting through the parking lot can be a headache during busy times, but overall great customer service and very professional.

This place rocks my socks. My two faves are the healthy Beth wrap and the light tuna wrap, their bagel with lox is delish as well. It is very busy, but definitely worth it. I wish they had more locations, but when I am in FH, I make heading to DJs a priority!!

By far the easiest car repair I've ever had! On my way to Payson, my car broke down, and i had to get towed to the nearest auto shop. They have an overnight key drop, so I simply wrote my concerns on the bag i put my key in, and dropped it in their secure box. This was so convenient for me being that i dont actually live in fountain hills. I would have had to paid a lot more to get it towed to my part of town. I got a call mid morning once they had a chance to check out the car, and heard the bad news...radiator was blown. They informed me that they could get it finished by the end of the day! Awesome. I still wanted to price check a bit. So i called infiniti, and they quoted me an estimate of $250 more. So this place is super competitive. I got my car back as promised that day, wallet a little thinner, but i was on the road again! I couldnt recommend Jim and his staff more. If you are in the area or looking for a professional mechanic, check these guys out!

This place was great! Came in for a good/unique Christmas idea for a family member, and ended up getting some super special cigars.  Scott was extremely helpful and walked me through some nice box selections.  For a Saturday morning, the place was pretty busy! They definitely have a good following and a great business established. I cant wait for my brother to open these up!

I walked in here on a whim to see if they could do some custom chocolate dipped pretzels for me. The staff was so accommodating and had my order ready for me by the time i was done shopping. They look beautiful! Im so excited this turned out and i know where to come for any other creative sweets!

My girlfriend and I started looking for a new, great nail place in old town when we had experienced a botched full set manicure 2 weeks back. We went in on a Sunday, when they were pretty busy, and not only did we get in and out w in an hour, we both were so happy w our fill! The lady was efficient and she fixed my horrible nail job. I will be back, and I will try to aim for the morning hours so they aren't so busy.

This place hit the spot. Wanting to dine italian tonight got us remembering out past couple visits to the grotto (both which had us wanting to come back). Im going to give the food 4 stars, and the service 5. Our meal started with the fried artichoke which were good, but i would have liked to see something more creative than an Alfredo dipping sauce. The Caesar salad would have been a lot better if the dressing was homemade. The baked ravioli and the chicken dish were good. lots of heavy cream sauce on the chicken alfredo, but that's what the meal is. The server made our experience worth the $70. From the greeting to the small chuckles through out the meals he was great! We will be back, and with such an extensive menu, id be excited to try another good dish.

Definitely the place to go for a breakfast burrito...anytime of the day! My go to is a potato egg and cheese. However, all of their burritos are scrumptious. Service is quick, salsa is fresh, and amounts are huge. Love this place for a quick bite.

I walked in to uni nails pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a typical salon w a short wait, and walked in to 11 pedi chairs and 15 nail stations, and my technician greeting me by name (right after i signed in). They had plenty of color and brand choices for polish, and the whole place didnt smell atrociously of chemicals. For $26 i got a fantastic massage with some pressure point maneuvers, and a sugar scrub. Super happy w my pedicure. I will definitely be back to try uni nails again.

Love this place. This is my movie theater of choice. Even though its a little further away, and a little more expensive, amc dine-in is the way to go.  My favorite thing to order is the veggie dipper. Its a perfect fresh nosh, and when im in the mood for a meal, I love the shrimp tacos (but sub fries, instead of chips).  I've been here a handful of times, and the cinema suites are the way to go. Fork and screen seats are a little less comfortable, but you can bring family under 21.  Their popcorn is serious....ly awesome, and i would highly recommend it if you want a delish salty snack thats 100% addicting.   We signed up for the stubs program and have gotten such a reward back, that it pays for itself 5 fold! Great investment, and definitely the way to go.  Love this place. Its a prefect combination of ipic and harkins.

Binkleys is a one of a kind dining experience.  This was our second time dining here, but our first with a large group (14 people). We made reservations a month ahead for a 30th bday extravaganza, and i was blown away with their attention to the small details that made the bday boy feel super special.  The courses were some of the most savoring flavors, and everything was cooked to perfection. So in that regard i will always give binkleys 5 stars.  The front of the house is where my disappointment lies for this review.  We spent 5+ hours here. The restaurant was packed, and we got there promptly, however we didn't even get our first course until 2 hours and 15 min in to when we sat down! Our server was clearly a little overwhelmed and ultimately we were waiting w plenty of libation and ready to eat our left arm by the time our first tasting arrived.  A little bit of advise--if dining here with a group (i wish our waiter would have recommended this)...either all do the same amount of tasting or all do a la carte ordering. The two people who simply wanted the meat course were left waiting, while the rest of the tasting party caught up to this course, until 1130p for their perfectly cooked rack of lamb!  At one point i needed to request to our matre d' that we needed to leave by 11:15, however by midnight i was left stressed out that we were still trying to inhale our cheese and dessert choices due to lack of planning on their service side.  All around I'm glad the bday boy had a good time, but a 5+ hour meal is approaching on just bad service. As a comparison, when we came here on our 1st visit, as a party of two, we had an enjoyable 3 hour meal which was a perfect amount of time.

I love this place! It is a great after work place, great wines by the glass, or buy a bottle from their wide-selectioned store. They have delicious small bites (made by the altas bistro) to nibble on .  On Thursdays, they have wine tasting, and the crowd is awesome! Young, fun and interesting, where as the other days of the week are more calm and relaxing. The sommeliers are what make this place special, and keep me coming back to learn more about their wines. I highly recommend this place, and hope you have as much fun as i did.

The technicians were nice, very pushy on mani/pedi combo, but nice. I would recommend going earlier on in the day. I went after work around 615 and my experience was definitely rushed. My mani took a total of 7 minutes, and it looks like it. I went in w long nails and ended up w short crooked nails w the nail polish starting half way up the nail. Two stars, because my pedicure was pretty enjoyable. The hot stone massage was nothing to write home about, especially on my shoulders (from the mani). She attempted to put the stones on my back from one side-while i was still sitting in the pedicure chair- and didn't even bother moving my hair out of the way...ouch!  The facility was clean and they had a good selection of polish colors and brands.  My friends love this place, unfortunately i dont see the quality.

For years after moving to AZ, I would still travel back home just to see my dentist due to some unfortunate experiences w dentists in the valley.  After 9 years, I decided to find someone local, permanently. Dr. Liu is by far one of the best. He is extremely meticulous, caring and very good at what he does. I've had more than a handful of fillings done by him, and every single one has been as pleasurable as an appointment to a dentist can be. Not only is he a great dentist, but a good business man, who understands customer service and honesty.  I would strongly recommend him!

This place is wonderful for a nice, affordable, sit down restaurant. My go to dish is the pho w extra noodles and veggies, but when I'm not in the mood for soup and noodles, the menu offers curry, stir fry dishes and many other Vietnamese dishes which are excellent as well. Its a family run business, and you can tell. Their attention to customer service and quality makes me come back time and time again. They do serve wine and beer, but i always go for their jasmine tea. It can get kinda busy around dinner time, but I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes.

Miserable people with no souls work here. I never thought changing a name on a license would be such an ordeal. Make sure you show up EARLY, before 8 or you will be waiting for hours. I will be going to a different mvd in the future.

I love this place. You cant beat the price at happy hour, and the crowd during the evening. I would recommend coming early if you are looking for a good table during the busy times from 3-7 and 10 and later. I always get the veggie or chicken wraps (which are a meal in themselves) and the rainbow rolls... All are delish! Drink specials are really great. Went a few times on the off happy-hour hours and it was substantially more expensive but still a good time. I will be back time and time again because of the consistently great experience.

We had an absolute blast on the night hunt! I want to do this every weekend of my life. We surprised the bday boy for his birthday and it was such a fun experience! Great idea for large parties. There was plenty of time to have a drink at a bar but also run around finding answers to clues. I hope they change up the challenges so the next time we do this we will have just as much fun!

Delicious concept. Fresh, clean dishes with amazing taste. Loved the cauliflower starter, and found my funghi pizza so yummy! The ahi salad was flavorful, but definitely on the spicy side. Don't discount their label of a Chile vinaigrette as a mild side sauce. It has a kick! They have a great wine list and an atmosphere which is wonderful for a good date night or a fun time out with some friends.  The menu left me wanting to try more. I will find an opportunity to come back and do so!

Im giving this place 2 stars because the experience is fun, but zero starts for the quality of work. I have been to this location more than a handful of times, and i want to like it so much, but each time i get a pedicure, the polish doesnt even go to the cuticle. Right when i left, i took a closer look, and my toes looked like i had a 3 week old grown out pedicure! When i had a mani, the polish didnt stay more than 6 hours and started peeling off. For $35 I am really only paying for the experience, not cute digitals.  As for the experience, you need to make an appointment, but once you get there, the ladies are super accommodating. Very patient, personable, and sometimes almost too talkative. I had my bachelorette party here. it was so much fun to be able to book the place out, and have me and my besties and some champagne to ourselves!  I will not be coming back here to get my nails done, especially since theyve raised the prices.

On my search for my wedding dress, I made an appointment with mariees to check them out. I loved the selection, and the boutique was beautiful. It seemed too easy to have found my dress after the first stop, so I decided to think it over a bit. I was shocked that they never followed up with me, and when I made an another appointment and went back, they didn't even remember me. I would highly recommend them, however I ended up going elsewhere.

When I became pregnant, I started the search for a doc who would be more convenient for me, and after looking on my trusty yelp app, I found Dr. Reuss. Yelp steered me in the best direction, yet again!   My entire experience w Dr. Reuss and his staff was professional, personable and nothing like I've ever experienced from a Ob/g. From getting a chance to see my soon to be bambino on the ultrasound in office, to thorough prenatal care, and a visit from him in the hospital a few days after i delivered, this Dr. went above what i expected. He has great bedside manner and truly listens to your questions. He provided me knowledgeable answers to my concerns with out forcing his opinion.   Although I initially found him for my pregnancy care, i will continue to come here for all my Gynecology needs.

If you are looking for a delish restaurant in old town look elsewhere. If you're looking for a place with overly priced bar food, bad ambience, and decent service, welcome to RnR! We have come here for game days and drinks which are pretty lively, but extremely loud. It is a good bar, but the food is sub par.   We most recently came on a Wednesday night. Made it in time for happy hour which entails 1/2 off all wine, beers, wells (i believe) and a select few small bites.  We ordered the animal fries and ate what seemed like day old fries smothered...and i mean smothered w BBQ sauce. The fries were rock hard. Not very enjoyable but we were starving. The salad we ordered was covered in way too much dressing and the grilled cheese wasn't even melted. I don't think ill be coming back, unless it is solely for drinks at happy hour.

I've been to stand up 5 times now, and what brought me back so many times was the location, and the guest comedians. It is a great, affordable and easy date night. After the fourth time however, I noticed a routine. Right as the show is getting good the owner Howard gets up and does his bit. It completely kills the mood--from discussing his stroke (every single time) to talking about disabled children, and giving philosophical opinions on life, it was all a bit of a buzzkill. The rest of the show was ruined for me. I want to love this place, but it's not worth it to go to a comedy show and not laugh and be entertained.

I was in the area looking to kill sometime and grab a quick bite. When i stopped in and the place looked cute! Clean, nice staff, and the Menu looked pretty good.  i ordered the veggie souvlaki, and For $8 i would have expected more veggies than taziki sauce. It was basically dipping pita bread in taziki sauce and have maybe a small handful of chopped up veggies. I wont be coming back for the meal i had.

After reading the reviews, i was a little hesitant over my groupon purchase. I came here 2 years (?) ago when they first opened, and this visit back has been such an improvement! For $5 you cannot beat this experience. Sip on some wine, maybe order a burger....even compared to a normal theater (but a lot cooler) the price is well worth it. There were no bobbling heads in front of me-blocking my view, and I was perfectly comfortable.  We had great service, and unlike some of the other reviews, no questions on our bill...even though they kept trying to give us an extra side of fries...after the second time...i should have just appeased them and taken them. Id recommend the flat bread, fries, salad or duo dip. Everything was pretty good, and with the whole feast plus some drinks we came out under $50.  I may be back, but its a little out of my way, and there are other dine in theaters (a little more expensive but comfier) closer to me. Still we had a great date!

This is one of my favorite weekend places! Despite the wait, once you sit, it is always enjoyable. They usually have a nice crowd in the back patio, with a handful of furry happily wagging pups. If you're not into the dog-friendly environment, the front patio or inside seating is really nice as well. The wait staff is wonderfully attentive, and ive never had a bad experience the many times i have been here. There are great menu options and a good assortment of local beers..they have an orange blossom beer that i really like. My favorite things on the menu are the cobb salad, and the Salmon blt.  Parking is a bit of a nuisance, but they have complementary valet that helps the issue. This location. Is extremely convenient, and its right off of the canal path. One of my favorite weekend events is to bike over with our pup. Its great exercise and you get to enjoy a beer at the end of it!

I had a situation over the last week where my alarm system kept making funny noises. I finally realized it wasnt going away, so I called Knox security. They came out THAT DAY! It ended up being just a low battery, but I am blown away by their customer service. While Jon was out here, we talked about different home automation features I could add. I can't wait for them to set up my RTI and thermostat automation. So cool!

Great food, good atmosphere, and right next the yard, plenty of after fun to be had. I decided to try this gem of a place after trying it at devoured festival. I was looking for the wow that i had experienced at their booth. We shared a handful of small bites. The oysters are the real star, but i would definitely recommend the Brussels sprouts and save room for the beignets for dessert! The scallop crudo was tasty, but i found the actual scallops got lost in the rest of the sauce/dish. I would skip the octopus, i found it charred a little too much and lacked flavor. However, there are a ton of items i left for my second visit, and am definitely excited to come back and try them!

This place was scrumptious! I cant wait to be back in gilbert so i can experience their super tasty food. The drinks were decent, our whole party of 5 ordered the fresh pressed juice (agua frescas). I ordered the cucumber mint which was different, and kinda dangerous in that I couldn't even taste the vodka that i ordered it with! I would love to try another flavor next visit. The chips were good and salsa was fresh. The food was great! My friend ordered the fish tacos, i ordered the veggie burrito (which was a tad salty, but still very good) and my husband ordered the beef burrito. The portions were VERY generous. We went during happy hour, so 2 drinks and 2 burritos (for my husband and i) came out to $24! Super affordable! Cant wait to come back.

For a place that specializes in burgers I was expecting more. After waiting an hour for our meal, the beef burgers were eh, OK, and the veggie burger was unappetizing--all rice, falling apart, and bland. I needed a fork to eat a burger. The waitress stopped by a total of 6 times in a 2 hour period. I will not be coming back to this over priced waiting lounge.

This cute little breakfast/lunch and coffee place is tucked right behind the cornish pasty co. Plenty of parking, and a very quaint spot to grab a coffee or sit down and order a meal. Their outside seating has sprinklers, and inside has a few tables. Great coffees, fresh omelets, and delicious waffles! I always go for the build your own omelet, and dip the side potatoes in their house curry sauce- definitely a nice switch up from my usual ketchup obsession. Another perk is their patio is puppy friendly! I will be back!

This has been my third visit to Bei, and 2 out of the three times I have been extremely happy. I love how the menu has udon noodles and some other dishes I have not found at other sushi restaurants, and the sushi is pretty good. Also, any place that has happy hour until 7 is awesome, however an advertised $7 per sake bomb is nothing to get excited about.

Love this place! Stopped by for some dinner and drinks and was pleasantly surprised by the simplisticly tasty menu and drinks.  Ordered the veggie tamale, burratta salad, and Italian panini. Veggie tamale was delish and great for a small bite. The salad was refreshing and had some crostini, and my fiancé said the Italian panini brought him right back to fond memories of jersey with the fresh deli meat. I liked that the music was present but not overpowering. The overall atmosphere was very much a coffee house turned hang out at night. Only reason for the 4 stars is that it was a little on the pricey side, however we will be back! Oooh and they're patio is dog friendly!

LOVE this place! We probably dine here every other week...Super affordable, good selection of pasties and beers, and the wait staff is great.  I love that they have vegetarian options like the veggie pesto chicken, and my husband enjoys their spicier carne adovada option. The pasties are pretty decent in size and definitely filling/hearty...think huge empanada. There are no substitutions for the ingredients, however w as many options as they have on their menu, there's something for everyone. If your one who likes British food, you'll find some staples like mushy peas, or bangers and mash. The restaurant is a come in and sit where you please kinda place- inside or outside on their patio.  Definitely save room for their dessert. Their bread pudding is amazing!

Visited sumo maya with my girlfriend on a Tuesday night. All the tables "inside" were all reserved for the night (I would recommend reservations), however the outside tables were extremely comfortable...even in the heat of the summer.  The green mojito came as a recommendation from the waitress. I would have never normally picked this off the menu, but what a great suggestion! It was refreshing, a little on the sweeter side, but awesome mixture of coconut and mint. I would definitely get it again.  As for the meal, we were told that everything was served tapa style, so we decided to share a few items. The guacamole w lump crab was great, and the chips had a great flavor. We also ordered the Hamachi ceviche and the Suzuki roll. Both were delicious, however when the bill came, I was left to reflect where the worth was. Although the food was good, for $80 I wish I would have tried something over-the-top, melt in your mouth good.   I will come back, but I think I would try something different like the Chilean sea bass.

I got to try this gem of a place at the Saturday night food trucks in old town Scottsdale. I selected their sea salt caramel cupcake, and it was the best thing i have ever eaten. Salty, sweet and very fluffy...and any other adjectives that would help to describe cupcake perfection. She had a couple of other flavors of cupcakes and brownies, and i cant wait for next week to try my next favorite!

Can i give this place 10 stars? My husband just surprised me, for my birthday, with TWO amazing cakes! I got to over indulge in the most decadent red velvet cake, and my all-time-favorite salted caramel cake. I need to try more. Everything I try is better than the last. Thank you sugar jam for making my bday so deliciously special! This is one to remember.

5 stars for the ambiance, 4 stars for the food. We had the duck appetizer, the burrata, the fried chicken the salmon and a panini. The salmon was very well done, but fairly plain, and the chicken had a great crunch, but at the end of the day was fried chicken. Fairly priced, but nothing too special. I will be back, but im looking for their something special on their menu.

Very cute and convenient wine bar. They serve wine, beer, small bites and "sandos" (sandwiches). It was a little on the pricier side, but what was nice is that they have 32 rotating wines that you can dispense yourself as a 1.5oz, 3oz, or 6oz pour by simply swiping a card they give you and selecting your choice of white or red wine. The wines they have by the glass range anywhere from a silver oaks cab which runs $39 for a 6oz pour to a $2 1.5oz pour for another pretty good, not as well known wine. The small bites are pretty yums. We ordered the bruscetta and the cheese plate, which were both served as a pretty decent portion.  The service was a little slow, but everyone was very helpful and friendly. I will definitely be back, maybe not as often as id like, due to the price, but this place is perfect for a nice date night.

We came here on a Thursday and it was super busy with an event they put on. Aside from the loud music inside, the food was great! Decently priced, and great atmosphere, i cant wait to come back. We ordered the burrata for a starter. I would have been happy having this for my meal! Super fresh, creamy and a pretty good portion for the two of us to share  For the meal we ordered the cauliflower fried rice and kale salad w shrimp.  Both were really good! After trying the "fried rice", i was pleasantly surprised.  Excellent flavor, and a little lighter than rice would be, and such a unique dish. The kale salad was hearty and plenty!  I liked that their menu selection wasnt too much, but what they had was well selected. We didnt mind that the service was a tad slow...it was nice to enjoy the people i was with, and never felt rushed.

I love this restaurant! It is my go to place for healthy fresh food. Not quite fast food, but not a sit down for hours kinda meal. I usually pick three sides (which at times theyre out of) and a protein for my go to order...you need to try the cauliflower. This time around i tried the mushroom pho. I would recommending passing on this dish...it has a weird broth consisting of mushrooms, herbs and cinnamon (which to me over powered everything). There are better things on the menu that will be sure to impress. They do serve a limited selection of wine and beer.

Cute new place to hang out and grab a beer, or enjoy a great well put together menu. The outside seating area is amazing when the weather is nice, and the whole inside opens up to create a really nice open feel.  The menu was very straight forward...apps, salads, pizzas, sandwiches and burgers.  We ordered the fish sandwich and the California club. The California club was amazing! It was huge, and had a nice amount of fresh grilled chicken. The fish sandwich wasn't bad, but it was a little dry--I loved the sides, but i would order something else next time.  Seemed like they don't have a full bar, and i didn't see their wine list this visit, so I'm not sure it exists. I'd definitely try this place again, especially when looking for a place to enjoy a gorgeous day out.

We were looking for a good restaurant in Tempe, and this was one of the first that popped up, and boy am i happy we gave it a try! It was great! The servers were attentive, and on a Friday night it was busy, but we were still able to get a table. The ambience was not that of a fancy restaurant, but still had a good feel and nice decor. With all the amazing pics of the bibimbop, i decided to order a shrimp one, as well as 3 other rolls: the salmon and scallop, the waikiki, and the volcano roll. The bibimbop was extremely flavorful! I want to return just for another taste!  The rolls were large and full of fish, not just rice, fresh and creative. The volcano roll was definitely rich,  the waikiki was a very straight forward but fresh, and the salmon and scallop had a great semi-spicy sauce. All in all, i cant wait to come back here. The menu has a great variety, the kalbi looked like one to not miss!

So happy to have a poke place nearby! Came here for their grand opening, and was happy to see the place popping! I ordered a bowl of the salmon poke and their luau special ahi. The fish was fresh and they had quite the selection of toppings. In the future, i would pass on the rice as it was kind of hard. Al dente rice isn't  my preference when eating poke. Their house sauce is a great sesame mix and complemented their salad option well. I liked that they had a tako (octopus) option, and was happy to see not just ahi available. The price wasn't outrageous- the large was 10.95 and had 3 scoops of fish which was plenty. The regular comes with 2 scoops for 8.95. A little tip if you cant decide which protein you want..  you can mix the different l!  I will definitely be back.

One of my new favorite spots in old town! The best thing on the menu are their "balls". I've tried both their veggie balls and rice balls, and both were so tasty and really, filling enough for a meal. They come with two fried balls smothered in tomato sauce. The pizzas are pretty wonderful too. Thin crust and piled with toppings.  They have quite a bit of space, both inside and outside. I think I liked their outdoor patio more before they put up the metal fences all over...there were grassy areas and an overall very open feel. But with plenty of umbrellas, they really allow for maximum enjoyment of the outdoor space.  Great wait staff, and good beverage selection. Nothing bad to say about this place...can't wait for our next opportunity to come back here!
