The salon was very clean and very cute. Very pink and very glamorous looking. The customer service was great and the nail technician was very sweet and she took her time to do my toes.  It was slightly more expensive than other places, but It was worth it.

Sushi here is great! The fish is fresh and chilled to the right temperature.  My favorite roll is the Spicy Red Dragon Roll.  There really is no need for wasabi and soy for this roll.  It already has loads of good flavors in it. I also enjoy their spicy/garlic edamame. The manager is super friendly and environment is nice and clean. Bathroom is clean which is also a plus! Overall best sushi place in Mesa.

Last night was an amazing dining experience I've had in a while. I am very particular when it comes to sushi. I went there with a few of my friends and we had All You Can Eat Sushi. The quality of the fish is fresh and at perfect temperature.  The Sashimi was amazingly delicious, so tender.  The man tended to us frequently even though they were swamped. He makes us feel important and welcomed.  The customer service was professional like a five star hotel.  I never saw the place so packed, full house.  I had such an enjoyable night that I had to write this review! I am satisfied and will definitely be returning this weekend with my family.

I don't enjoy giving places low stars, but this experience...wasn't the greatest.  My dog is a mix of pomeranian and chihuahua.  I asked the groomer to hand cut and trim my dog's fur short, however she recommended to shave her fur and said that it might not grow the same way.  It was the same price to trim it by hand.  It took an appropriate amount of time, but when I came back, my dog's fur was still long...which was disappointing.  This place is also a boarding house for dogs. They need to do something about the odor in the lobby.  I walked in and it smelled like urine and ammonia. I don't think I would go back again.

My favorite clean place to go after the gym for a post workout treat. I love to get the Pitaya Colada Bowl and the Strawberry Passion Acai Bowl. It's very healthy and the portion is good. Great customer service and they have a punch card too which is nice. Buy 10 get 1 medium free. They also sale protein powder.

This place is always busy at lunch hour! If you have only an hour lunch, then it wouldn't be a good idea to go. The line and wait is not as long if you go before noon.  Customer service experience was good. Friendly people and clean place.  I love getting their croissant sandwiches for lunch. Comes with a small side of salad or soup. Their breakfast is very tasty! French Toast is a must try! They have this honey maple syrup that goes well with it!

If you are looking for a clean, cool, healthy place in the area, then Nekter is the place to go.  The customer service was lacking, but other then that, I would have given this place a five star.  I'm just glad they have a store near me.  I would come back for my Pitaya Bowl and Pink Flamingo Smoothie. They always make it just right.

By far my favorite spot for breakfast!! I had the Caprese Benedict which was amazingly delicious!  That plate had ripe heirloom tomatoes tossed with pesto, served over mozzarella. It also comes with 2 poached eggs (caged free eggs) with cream cheese hollandaise on top of crispy toast. I'll definitely come back again to try more items on the menu.
