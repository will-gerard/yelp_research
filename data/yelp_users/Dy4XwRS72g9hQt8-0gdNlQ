I really only wear heels and since moving to Phoenix I realize I'm going to need a great shoe repair place because this city is full of rocks gravel and concrete! I took 3 pairs of pumps and 1 pair of Aldo booties. I was worried it was going to be expensive because some of the heels, the screw was completely exposed. To my surprise - I paid $10 a pair and my total was $40. One of the pairs they repaired had satin covering the heel. They did a great job to repair and glue down the tattered satin as best as they could. They even colored in my black heels that had some scuff damage. They went above and beyond. I will absolutely come back time and time again. I also found out they do alterations and if you love clothes like I do you understand how difficult it is to find a place that can execute a tricky hem / original hem! This places offers that so I'm excited to try them out for clothing alterations next. The staff are all very friendly and accommodating. You def get the family business vibe when you're here. Will be back soon!

OH.MY.GOODNESS! I don't know that there is anything on the menu that is bad! My boyfriend and I wanted to go out to eat on a Saturday night. We were starved but couldn't decide. I usually pick the region of food and he picks the restaurant (bc he's from here and I'm not). I said hearty American food or American bistro. We decide as we're walking to the car....CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. So random.   We get to Lolo's and I'm loving the atmosphere. The art on the walls is cool. The music is good. Everyone looks happy to be stuffing their faces. I see mason jars with colorful drinks all over which really sparked my interest. BUT decided against booze and went with a traditional sweet tea. Holy cow was this sweet tea everything I hoped it would be. It reminded me of sweet tea in the south. Like Georgia south. The REAL south. Not too sugary but not super bitter. It was just right and so refreshing.   We got an app sampler platter. Fried okra, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and slaw. The fried okra was crispy and seasoned to perfection. The potatoes were creamy. The mac n cheese was probably my favorite. You know when the cheese is sharp enough that it doesn't need seasoning and does that warm gooey thing when you pull it apart. Ya ...it was like that! The slaw wasn't soggy like most slaw is at bbq joints. It was still crispy and very flavorful.   Then dinner came! We both opted for chicken and waffles. The chicken was so moist and the batter was fried for the perfect amount of time. Its like they have it down to a science in the kitchen here. The outside is crispy and seasoned well and the inside is moist and hot. The waffle was delicious. It almost had a sweet flavor too it. It wasn't chewy it wasn't soggy. It was as if the food was plated, put in the window, and whisked away to our tables immediately. Each bite I took I made sure to have an equal chicken to waffle ratio and dabbed it in syrup then in a little hot sauce. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about this meal lol. The prices are on point. The serving sizes are HUGE...so in reality you get more than what you're paying for.  We will be back again....and again.....and again...and again! Besides, I still gotta try the mason jar kook-aid!!!!

I am a Midwest transplant who loves her corned beef! They have really mastered it out east! I was craving a solid roast beef sandwich for a while since moving here 2 months ago and I work near Dilly's. I decided to quiet the craving and give Dilly's a try. I hate to say it but I was so disappointed. I think the photo really speaks for itself. Either the person who made the sandwich was in a hurry or they are cutting back on the ounces of corned beef portions for the sandwiches!! But corned beef sandwiches are normally supposed to tower in between slices of bread and be practically tipping over on its side! I am sad to say it was not a winning sandwich, my craving was not satisfied, and I'm back to trying to find a real corned beef sandwich! I will say, the employees there are super nice! The restaurant is very clean!

STAY AWAY!!! SERIOUSLY DONT WASTE YOUR $$  Being a native Chicagoan I had high hopes. As someone who has been a server and bartender for the last 10 years...I had mediocre expectations seeing as how it was game day. Walking in, the place was DEAD. I mean DEAD. The TVs were cool, the bar was nice and big...empty...nice big and empty. The restaurant was super empty. There were maybe a dozen people in here tops!   Our server was a millennial - so again mediocre expectations - even with the place being dead I was anticipating a half ass attempt. Maybe it was her unkept hair or the skirt she had on that was way to big...or that she dragged her feet when she walked as if to say "I seriously do not want to be here right now". I will nevermind the fact that she didn't even know whose football jersey she had on. Lol. The girl must have a severe allergy to smiling too because that was not happening.   The first round of beers took about 15 mins to get to our table. The waters ....about 20mins. Strange because beer comes in a bottle and water out of a tap. So...unless the entire bar was out of bottle openers and faucets...I can't see why this took so long. Whatever, overlooked it because I was anticipating authentic Chicago eats!!!   I ordered a Maxwell street polish. My boyfriend ordered a burger. His brother - a burger and his brothers wife - a salad. My boyfriend's brother had a plane to catch so we had time but not a ton of "waiting for our waitress to stop facebooking on the clock at the hostess stand" time.   The food came an hour later. AN HOUR for two burgers a salad and a freaking glorified hot dog. It takes less time to drive to Fry's, buy ground beef, heat the grill, make 2 burgers, chop a salad, and microwave a hot dog. Whatever, overlooking it because the food is going to be so good.......right?   NOT! NOT EVEN CLOSE! The burgers sat under the heat lamp in the kitchen window for what must have been an eternity, or at least thats what the burger texture told us. My polish sausage bun was so hard I could knock on the table with it. You know when you find old hot dog buns in the BACK of the pantry and say "oh we'll feed it to the birds bc its obviously old and stale", and when you do the buns just crumble into dust particles? THIS WAS MY BUN! The salad was "fine". SHOCKER  I ask the food runner (oh no wait she was the shift manager. Why the shift manager is running the food for the complacent millennial waitress is beyond me)- can you go get me another bun so i don't break my teeth on this thing. She says sure no problem and takes the entire basket of food away. My boyfriend's brother also asked for a new burger and asked to make it quick this time because he had a plane to catch. She whisks off into the kitchen and he and I wait. My boyfriend decided to keep his burger because he was starving and didn't want to hulk out in the restaurant. He ate a few bites of it and was completely grossed out. It was rubbery and the cheese was hard.   20 mins later still no new burger and no new hot dog bun. WTH!!!??!?! I go to the hostess station and the hostess is facing the corner texting on her phone. I stand and wait for her to finish......and wait........and wait........and shake my head giggle and wait. She turns around and says "OMG I'm so sorry....can i help you?" i tell her to finish her text, that I can wait. She laughs and says no its ok how can I help you. I ask to speak w/  a manager. She asks why and I want to say "to rat on you for texting at the hostess station kiddo", but tell her I have a question. I wait and wait and wait she never comes back. I walk BACK to my table and there's the manager...at the table. Wait she's the food runner? Apparently not...she's the shift manager. My boyfriend and his brother explain what an ordeal its been. She apologizes and brings a new burger and polish out. We asked what was going on in the kitchen and what is with the servers crap attitude? I mean not even pretending to be appreciative that she has a job! The manager kind of had the same attitude though. We got a very scripted apology and a $25 gift card. The manager said " i will make sure we take the second polish off your bill and the hamburger". I'm sorry the SECOND polish? I asked for a new bun not an entirely new polish sausage. Really? You really think you're doing me a solid by taking the second polish off the bill...as in...you were going to charge me for 2 but since we voiced our concerns w/ our service your manager in training etiquette and experience in customer service compelled you to "comp" the 2nd polish sausage? Get outta here.   We will NEVER come here again. We used the gift card to pay for the salad, the other burger that my boyfriend had 2 bites of, and the beers.   STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT!!! THE STAFF IS TERRIBLE THE MGMT IS TERRIBLE THE FOOD IS TERRIBLE THE KITCHEN IS TERRIBLE. I could see if they were swamped...then maybe I wouldn't be so brutally honest but they weren't! NO EXCUSE!

My fianc√© and I are always on the hunt for local joints that have both sushi and Pho on their menu. Up until coming here we hadn't  found a location that nailed both dishes! Homerun for both the sushi (lots of variety) and the Pho here! We were looking for a place that was close to home (we live downtown) and had menu options for both of us! Consider us regulars now!! It's an added bonus that this place is located next door to the movie theater. Makes for lovely impromptu date nights .   The menu items are reasonably priced (2 appetizers two beers 3 sushi rolls and Pho = less than $60) There is a good beer selection (GIANT Kirin bottles) and expansive saki selection. The sushi menu is fully loaded. There is lots to choose from: sushi for beginners and sushi for the connoisseurs. The fish tasted fresh and the sauces they use here boast lots of flavor that didn't over take the fish in the rolls. The Pho had an intoxicating aroma and the broth flavors were intense...in a tasty way. The soup comes with a side of lime cilantro and sprouts which makes for a traditional pho experience. Overall we love this place and will continue to come back and try new sushi with our Pho. We found it randomly and we're delighted that we did. Oh and the staff is friendly and professional, but even if they weren't we would still be back ;)

My fianc√© had been wanting to bring me here for quite some time. We finally had a weekend with zero plans and were able to have a cozy date night. I always look forward to an eclectic hand crafted cocktail menu and Crudo has nailed theirs. I ordered the Temporary Treuse. It was hot outside and the promise of lemon and pear sounded cool and refreshing. The drink was tantalizing and the garnish was a nice touch. Pear honey and lemon pair so nicely...who would have thought? ;)  Anyway - the concept at this place is like a cousin to the tapas theme. The plates are smaller and great for sharing w/ another person.  I really liked this concept and besides, sharing plates with my better half while on a date night made the experience even more fun. The menu is split up into 5 categories: Raw, Cheese, Antipasti, Cooked, and Grilled. We decided to do one of each (except no cheese). We did 1 Raw 1 Antipasti 1 Cooked and 1 Grilled.   The pig ears from the antipasti menu were delightful. These fun little cracklings have the saltiness and texture of a pork rind glazed with a sweet Thai chili sauce. This small starter made for an exciting appetizer bite before our other dishes came out. They went quickly so it was a good thing the next couple plates came out fast!  From the Raw menu we ordered the albacore with citrus tonnato and dill. This was by far the best albacore I've ever had. All we could do was talk about how FRESH it tasted. The citrus was so light it was the perfect pairing w/ the albacore and didn't over power it at all. The dill was a tiny garnish which gave it a little kick at the end of each bite. From the cooked menu we got the Squid Ink Risotto. This dish was fun. The flavor was great but risotto is never high maintenance when it comes to flavor - just when it comes to cooking it and this dish was cooked perfectly. And no - the squid ink did not turn our teeth black hahaha. Lastly from the grilled menu we ordered the Squid dish. This was served with some sweet nardello peppers and cannellini beans in a nice salsa. The grilled squid was a nice texture to pair w/ the risotto and helped to feel like you were having an actual full on meal instead of small plates. The squid was cooked to perfection and did not have that overcooked rubber texture - each bite was clean and crisp. The beans in the dish provided plenty of protein and helped to "fill you up".   Everything on the menu was so tempting but after these 4 dishes we had zero room! The bar staff was friendly. Busy but still made time to chat w/ us. Typically we sit at the bar because we enjoy pursuing the liquor choices. The prices are incredibly reasonable. You get a big city menu that boasts big flavor, you get big city drinks that are exquisitely crafted, and all at the cost of a boutique local spot. The bar area was def more quiet than the restaurant area which we enjoyed. The wall behind us was a giant chalkboard that had the entire cocktail menu all chalked out with small graphics of what each drink looked like when its poured. Thought that was a nice artistic touch to get the guests more involved when selecting their drinks. The lighting was soft and the foyer was inviting with its large armchairs and small library.    All in all we'll be back again to try something new from each menu! We were very pleased.

So I get a random craving for arroz con gandules while running on the treadmill at the gym. So what do I do? Finish my run, go out to my car and yelp - puerto rican food near me. Puerto Rico Latin Bar & Grill pops up so I call and place a pick up order.   Arroz con gandule, lechon, alcapurrias and a couple pastelillos. After the treadmill this is obviously counterproductive but a craving for arroz is.....well if you've ever had one you totally get it.   The food was ready QUICK! The restaurant was only 15mins from my gym and when I got there it was just about ready. The arroz was perfection. The lechon was moist and seasoned well! The alcapurrias and pastelillos were yummy - but then again if you're a REAL authentic PR restaurant it is pretty difficult to screw these two menu items up! The portion size was so much so that I had enough for myself, my boyfriend, and then lunch for myself the next day.   The owner rang me up and chatted w/ me a little bit. He was super friendly and you can tell he really cares about the success of his business. I highly recommend this place...especially if you're familiar w/ PR food. The owner gave me a coupon to use when I return. I will be taking my PR family back to try this. Caribbean cuisine in the desert...I couldn't be happier!
