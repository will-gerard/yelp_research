A nice place to eat before spending too much at the ballpark or arena. Down home service and sinful cobbler top the reasons to drop in.

When I first moved to the neighborhood in 1999, I visited and became hooked. Home made everything. Fresh ingredients, great pies, and you've got to love their all-you-can-eat fish Fridays. If you're on a diet, as I am, they'll grill the cod for you rather than fry it. Yummy! Linda is a hoot. Charming, which is to say a bit creaking, too, but you know when you go that what you get is food that is cooked fresh to order. Lots of specials (written on index cards that are paper-clipped to the menu) and an easygoing attitude. Go when you're looking to shake off the taste of too much fast food.

I love this place. It's a little bit of the Bronx right here in dusty Phoenix. The thing I crave of theirs is the stromboli, which is filled to bursting with fresh ingredients. It's often my choice for my cheats on my diet. Gotta love when New Yorkers come in and show the rest of the town how it's done.

Warning, this place is NOT good for your diet. But for your soul, it's perfect. Great homemade cooking that is flavorful and filling. The fried chicken is the best I've ever had. Seriously. The sides are wonderful, the drinks are what you'd expect to have if sitting on a wraparound porch in the antebellum south.   The service is slow, but go expecting that, and go with cash, because they are old school and don't accept plastic. It may take awhile, but they're cooking this from scratch, so enjoy looking at all of the famous autographs scrawled on the walls, joke around with your host, and be ready for a week's worth of calories in one sitting. You'll surely be glad you did, shug.

Perhaps all of the great reviews set me up for disappointment, but I don't understand all of the buzz. An Armour hotdog, half a strip of bacon, a Wonder bread bun, and, admittedly, lots of toppings for $2.75. Of course, if you're in the mood and you're passing by, I guess it's convenient.

Owner was rude. I left, but my wife stayed to look. As soon as I left, he mocked me without realizing my wife was still there. How rude owners in retail stay in business is beyond me. Avoid.
