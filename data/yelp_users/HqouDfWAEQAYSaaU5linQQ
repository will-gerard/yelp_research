The food is fine, if you actually get the order you've requested AND it's made to order the way you've requested. I've tried to do this twice and both times, my orders were not correct and the owner threw a fit about doing requests that they clearly say they are OK with honoring. The service is awful, the employees are so rude, and they don't give change. They just expect a tip on top of their delivery charge. I will never deal with them again. They clearly enjoy telling the customer they're wrong and don't care about customer service.

We had po' boys at lunch today and they were well seasoned and tasted fresh. My oysters were crispy! We will definitely be returning. Thank you, for the friendly service!

Always a great experience. Sushi is creamy, crunchy, and delicious. Can't wait to go again!

The first service was good. The 2nd one, was OK. The last one was horrible. The floors and bathtub were still dirty. The man was very nice. The last one I had a credit for and it didn't show up on my account. This company is very hard to reach. I had to send an email not really knowing if anyone was going to receive it. I logged in a few days later and noticed there was in fact a credit now showing. No one told me. Had I not checked, I wouldn't have known.
