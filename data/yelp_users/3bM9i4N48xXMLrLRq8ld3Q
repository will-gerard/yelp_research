Terrible pedicure and terrible gel nails. Not a good color selection and they don't put the polish up to your cuticles so both only lasted barely a week. On top of it lady told me only to bring tip in cash, shouldn't even tipped her at that point.

I've been tired of bad nail salon after bad nail salon and finally found a nail salon that listened to how I wanted my nails done and was personable towards me. Very clean and professional, I will definitely be going back and am so happy I found a good nail salon in this area.

I take my previous review back! I had gotten my nails filled here 3 times and then noticed mold growing under my nails! Yup MOLD! I was happy because they did my nails quickly and got me in and out but there is no price to pay for MOLD! I will never be going back here again!

Not very friendly atmosphere. Felt rushed in and out. The lady did a bad job on my acrylics they are crooked and not smooth. She also hurt me when putting them on and didn't want to listen to me about how short I wanted them. She didn't say a word to me the whole time I got a full set and pedicure. Went with 4 friends and no one was very satisfied. Will not be going back.

Love this Sprouts! It is always clean and the employees are always very helpful. One of the things I noticed is that sometimes the fruits and vegetables are mixed up between made in the USA or made in Mexico so you have to kinda dig around for the difference in the same bin. The best part of Sprouts is the produce, the prices are cheaper and they last at least a week longer than anywhere else you buy produce (except a real farmers market). Also if you bring your own bags they give you $0.05 off of your bill for every bag that you bring in. =)

I love ra and have been here many times and many locations. This ra has the worst service of all! We had to ask for our server multiple times and usually do at this location. This was a Friday night and there were tons of open tables. The worst part is that they were out of fried ice cream.. The whole reason we went to Ra instead of a different sushi place. The server did nothing. I am sorry but you shouldn't be out of your desserts on a Friday night and there's clearly something wrong with this location since it was empty on a Friday night and every other ra you go to is packed beyond belief. We will be going to the other locations from now on.

Got bagels and coffee to go this morning and was very disappointed. For a breakfast place their coffee is awful and they don't even have real half and half out or the right cups for iced coffee. They also do not have stevia or raw sugar.. They need to get an update on this bandwagon. I'll give it to them that their bagels are fresh but our bagel sandwich was half heartily put together. It was dry and they did not get either orders right I asked for a jalapeño bagel and got plain and I asked for pepper jack cheese and got cheddar.. Needless to say I will find a different place to get bagels and coffee.

I come to this restaurant all the time and the food is great. I came tonight and we were over sat at the tepanyaki table which was okay.. Although the chef wasn't aware so we had to remind him a few times. The kicker though there was a cockroach.. Crawling across our toes. We were sat at 9 and at 10 a server started.. 10 min after the cockroach was killed and swept away... Did anyone say sorry? No. We had to wait until the end of our $250 bill to get up and ask the manager if he was aware what happened. Which he said he was and was on the phone with "Eco lab" for the whole hour we were eating and couldn't apologize. No one apologized finally when we asked we got a $50 gift card... Well remember there's never just 1 cockroach there's a lot more so I will never go back and that $50 gift card is like a $50 gift certificate to a town dump.

Went here for happy hour and sat in the cantina, chips and salsa were delivered immediately and were delicious. Our server was kind and on top of it. The meal I got seemed a little over cooked but besides that everything was delicious and their happy hour prices were great.

The grocery store is amazing but the pharmacy really needs to get it together. Every time I go there I run into issues but they don't care to tell me the issues until I come back to pick up my prescription. I waited 30 mins to come back and find out there was a computer error I was then told 15 more minutes to find out that they didn't have either of my prescriptions. What were they doing for 45 minutes?

Ive honestly had it with this gym. It is honestly the worst LA Fitness I have ever been too and it is in one of the nicest areas of Phoenix/Scottsdale. They said they got "new machines and equipment" but I dont know if they bought them from a garage sale and added them in because everything is awful and so out dated. The weights are always all over the place and even though the trainers have designated weights for themselves in their "special" corner they tend to steal all the weights from the rack. There are dirty paper towels every where and theres no one going around to pick them up. Whoever put the mirrors in the building was an idiot because they are so incorrectly placed that majority of the time you cannot see yourself. Ive gone there 5 times a week for a year, and the staff half the time says hi to me or their too busy conversing with each other or eating. I do not know who the main manager is, you would think since Ive been going there so long, they would have the decency to know their members. I've tried a few of their yoga classes and they were so bad that half the class left 30 minutes into it. One class I went too the whole time we were doing warrior poses and that was it... I know gym yoga isnt the best but this was just flat out awful. Ive started to drive out of my way to the McCormick Ranch LA Fitness and the 7th Street/Moon Valley LA fitness because this is so bad. The reason that Ive had it with this gym though is this morning I went to go workout.. and whoever was supposed to show up at 7AM to open the gym, never showed up. It was 7:45AM when I got there and there was about 50 people waiting outside saying that this is the 3rd time this has happened.   PS the trainers are awful I always see them staring off or just blabbing along while their clients are in the worst form about to pop out a knee or shoulder.. Safe. Also I had friends asking for a female trainer, they were told there were none and female trainers look like guys anyway so why should it matter that they don't have any.. Yeah made them feel good when they wanted to sign up and pay for PT.  I worked at Gold's Gym in Scottsdale when I was younger, I know how a gym is supposed to work and the issues they run into. Gold's Gym Scottsdale is not a good gym but this makes it look amazing. I also agree with Jack N. the members that go to this gym most of the time should be given a discount. I have my ACE Advanced Healthy and Fitness Specialist Certification and my BS in Nutrition. I work full time as a Nutrition and Weight Management Health Coach and believe I have the right to say all of this.   Someone needs to knock down this LA Fitness and fire everyone involved and start from scratch.

Awful service. Stated couldn't split a 6 person check because he couldn't remember what each of us ordered.. When we labeled them for him still got it wrong. Manager was no help stated that he just wanted us in and out and he didn't even apologize for the issue plus HE was wearing diamond earrings with a tux. If I want to go to a nice restaurant and have a $300 bill I shouldn't have to deal with bad service and will take my business elsewhere.

Awful service. Called in to ask how much an oil change was and was told $21. Get there and am told that I have to use synthetic oil which will be $5-10 more.. Well luckily I asked the total because it turned out to be $58... That's a lot more than 5-10 more, so I asked and he said the lowest he could go was $44... That's still way more, so I left. False advertising.

I read all the great reviews from this place so I was excited to try it. I ordered it online and it said it'll be ready in 30 minutes. When we got there 20 minutes later they said that they had technical difficulties with their printer apparently and it didn't print out so we had to wait another half an hour for the food. Finally an hour later we got home to eat it and honestly I wasn't impressed. The yakisomi noodles were very dry, there were very little vegetables and the beef was not good. The drunken noodles were also dry and not very hot although we did order medium so that could've been our part but they were still dry. The dumplings were over fried and very dry as well. The crab rangoons were okay. I'm not sure I will be returning but I guess I should've guessed with the low prices.

I love sushi and happy hour and am always looking for a great sushi spot and I think it's safe I found my favorite in the Scottsdale valley. Great service, great sushi, lots of options and prices are even good too! I have nothing to complain about and I've been here a few times and will continue to go back!

So far so good, today was my first time here. They were very polite, did a great job with my nails and got me in quickly. I definitely will be going back!

I love which which in Tucson, so excited when It came to scottsdale. I ordered my favorite sandwich in large and untoasted. After waiting 15 minutes for my sandwich, they gave me a small even though they charged me for a large and it was toasted. Guess I'll just have to continue to get my which which in Tucson.

Went there this Saturday for lunch with the family. We ordered the bloody Marys which took about 20 minutes for them to make and tasted like tomato juice.. we had to add our own salt, pepper and it still was bland. I ordered the Italian sandwich in ciabatta bread. The sandwich was so dry and the bread was old and crumbling to the point where I just took the meat out of the bread.. The burgers were just "okay" and the rueben was served on a rye bun which added too much bread to the sandwich to enjoy it. The service was very slow and we had to continue to ask our server where our food was and for the bill after our table was cleaned off and we were done we were left waiting. There was about 6 other people in the whole place.. so it wasnt busy. At one point we even asked the server for our appetizer and he said that theres a lot of plates in the window.. uhm okay thats when youre supposed to bring it out. Originally heard this place was great which is why we wanted to try it, but the 6 of us were all very disappointed.

I am definitely a burger fan and this place has great burgers and beers for great prices! I am not even a beer fan but the flights are fun and only $7! You get to build your own burger with many different options or they have options on the menu if you dont trust what you would build. We've been back 2x in the past 2 weeks already and even saw Kurt Warner and his wife dining there last week. The only reason I give them 4 stars and not 5 is because they can do a little bit more work on their french fries and believe their truffle fries should come with the truffle sauce and but a little bit more thin. Otherwise delicious burgers!

Amazing sandwiches! So many options and there's even more online! The sandwiches are HUGE! My fiancé and I both ended up only eating half and he can eat, so I would recommend sharing a sandwich if you don't like leftovers. Great music as well.

The first time we ordered delivery and although the burgers were cold they were good. This time I did a to go order and I don't even know what to say. I am not sure if I am eating a burger or left over grease... It is the most burnt piece of black stuff I ate and no they didn't ask me how I like my burgers which now I learned I should've asked for medium rare. If only Hop Doddy did to go orders but I really should've just driven through in and out. They need to learn how to cook their burgers or clean their grill not sure. What a disappointment.

Very easy to schedule an appointment. I did extra strength for 50 minutes and did not see a noticeable difference in my teeth, took pictures in different lighting to make the effect of it. (I don't smoke or drink coffee or red wine so my teeth aren't very yellow, but also heard an older women complaining that her teeth didn't noticeably change either) I also got strep throat right after, it may be a coincidence but wanted to post Incase anyone else was getting sick too.
