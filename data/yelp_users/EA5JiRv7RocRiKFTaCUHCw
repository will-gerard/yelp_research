Fantastic museum. The Indian exhibits are expansive and usually heart wrenching. It is worth going on one of the free guided tours (they run frequently). My guide was very knowledgeable and provided much insight to all exhibits, including the temporary Georgia O'Keefe. The main entrance area is a nice place to lounge outside and have a picnic or something. The staff is very nice and friendly. Parking was easy.

Drive to the summit for great views!  There are some sweet hiking trails as well, good for kids and bringing your dogs too. Don't forget a water bottle though because I was dehydrated by the end of it and couldn't find a fountain anywhere.

This place is actually not good. I went here several times before finally putting my foot down. It is worth a couple extra bucks and walking two blocks to go to Stingray, or really, anywhere else. Like, this place is actually bad, I am unclear on their rating or how they are still in business. I'll give them an extra star for decent service.

PROS: This place is so fun!!! The river is a great spot to chill with and make new friends. The company makes it easy with frequently running buses, and there are a decent number of people on staff makes lines move quickly even on busy days. CONS: The river is absolute ratchet trash. I mean this physically and metaphorically: physical trash like beer cans and marshmallows; metaphorically trash like people who have tramp stamps and tribal tats.  COOL: We saw wild horses.  NOT COOL: These randos attached themselves to our pod like Somalian pirates and kept squirting us with water guns.  NOTES: You need cash money and your ID. BRING SUNSCREEN!

My favorite spot for Taco Tuesday/Tequila Tuesday. The margaritas are dankalicious. The tacos don't rock my world, but are reasonably priced. Love the quesadillas, love the outdoor seating. Service is hit or miss, more toward the miss, but I've come to accept and embrace this because overall, Dos Gringos is so fun. PS No bunnies allowed

Like a fool, I waited until my pet with critically ill before finding a veterinarian. What's more, my pet is a rabbit, also known as an "exotic species," so not all veterinarian clinics have doctors with that certification.  It was nighttime. Panda Bun Bun was behaving very peculiar, unable to sit up on her own, not eating food or drinking water. Rabbits deteriorate quickly, so I was panicked. I went on Yelp, and found Scottsdale Veterinary. What a relief to find out they offer 24 hour care and have an exotic pet vet on-duty.  After various examinations and test, they diagnosed my precious Panda with GI Stasis, a disease that is life-threatening. I checked her in for medical boarding, where they paid close attention to her around the clock and administered her medicine.  What makes Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic special is the extra care they give to their animals patients. In turn, the solace that gives its human (I dislike the term "owner" when speaking about pets). For Panda, they gave her a report card grading her behaviour and comments on her progress. They also would text me photos of her!  After this initial visit, I used SVC for rabbit boarding a couple times. They gave Panda her own room separate from the barking dogs and other things that can frighten rabbits. They were super nice to her and nice to me (again, I am not over the report card or the picture messaging). I am super grateful SVC was able to diagnose and treat her in time, and also provide affordable boarding when I went out of town.  Thanks team!

Great drunchie spot. Better pizza than Gus', but also longer line, typically.

I loved living here! San Tropez is a lush paradise haven in an otherwise concrete strip mall known as South Scottsdale. The best part of San Tropez is not the actual apartments--which are very similar to the nearby San Marin as they are designed by the same architect--but rather, the pool. It is a gorgeous, spacious area with covered cabanas and romantic lighting. I've had many a Snapchat and Instagram photo shoot here to make my non-Arizonan friends jealous, that's for sure.   PROS: - Nicole at the front desk became my therapist haha. Plus, in the office they usually have lemonade and cookies in the office #yum  - Good turnaround time for maintenance requests - The demographic of ST ranges from college-aged to families with children. It is not a huge party place compared to other complexes in Scottsdale. - On the greenbelt - great for running, golf, watching the sunset, etc. - Rent is extremely reasonable, especially compared to where I live now (the Bay Area)  CONS: - Limited parking. Only one covered spot guaranteed per apartment, regardless of # of bedrooms. - My biggest trouble was with my mail bouncing when I first moved in because they didn't put my name on the mailbox for weeks, but it eventually got resolved. - Charge you an unreasonably high cleaning fee when you move out.  P.S. No glass allowed at the pool!

This place is super good! The downside is that I can't go here for lunch because they take legit forever to make anything, even a pear salad (and that doesn't include lettuce btw). If you are in the mood for a leisurely meal, this is a good bet.

3 reasons why DJ's deserves 5 stars:  1) Owner is the nicest guy in town 2) Quesadillas are awesome  3) Miss Pacman machine  'Nuff said.

YES. So good. I'm not sure if they tell the employees to behave the way they do ( 1/2 stoner,  1/2 flirt) but it always entertains me and service is not sacrificed. Consistently amazzziiinngg food and that breakfast buzz is spot-on #worththe600calories  PRO TIP: order the Baby Buzz. it is the same as a breakfast buzz but smaller/cheaper.

Hit or miss, but usually worth the wait!  Hit: crab cake benedict (regular style is better than the Daily Dose style with the gravy, imho)  Miss: hangover sandwich (cute name, but actually unappetizing). sangria-margarita slushie looks/sounds yummy, but actually was so gross I couldn't finish it #rare  If they tweaked the menu a lil bit, this place could be A+

It's so sad no one goes here anymore. They play the best music, i.e. Bay Area music. They played D-Lo once and I absolutely lost my shit. They lose a star for unclear dance floor and unclear bottle service area. They gain one star back though because one time I caused a scene and they didn't kick me out when they probably should have #thanksMrSecurityGuard. I hope they don't go out of business, but at this rate, it looks like they might.

The food is delicious, farm to fork yadda yadda, but they put way too much sauce on every dish. How do you manage to make organic vegetables an unhealthy meal?! This was especially the case with the brussel sprouts, which were absolutely drenched in sauce and it took away from it's natural wonderful flavor. Chefs, as good as the good is, go easy on the prep. The famers already did most of the work for you.

The only reason I go here so frequently is because it is conveniently located in the Galleria. It is definitely overpriced, the woman is always on her phone while I'm order, and their POS system is straight out of 2005. I'm giving them 4 stars because, at the end of the day, the food is actually good. However, they mess up my order LITRALLY every time. I actually have to send it back for one reason or another (such as forgetting a fundamental ingredient in the sandwich) every time. I would probably not ever recommend this place, even tho I myself go all the time #yolo

Sunday morning yoga is awesome because it's outside under the beautiful palm trees. The teacher wasn't the best when I went, and it goes without saying that the clothing is overpriced. However, I buy it anyway because it's super cute and top of the line. Their pants last forever, I swear!

I've been here a few times, but it is only by default. I love SUP and kayaking, and they are the only company who do rentals in the area (water sources in Phoenix metro are minimal). The customer service is literally always sub-par. From employees arguing with each other in front of customers, misplacing our purses, or just sitting there socializing instead of helping us bring the kayaks back onto the dock... Additionally, this isn't their fault, but Tempe Town Lake smells ratchet. If there was any competition in the area, this place would have to get their act together or they'd be driven out of business fast #capitalism

Came here because my new watch was too big for my wrist and needed a few links taken off. The person working there was really chill. Gave me a few bucks off an already inexpensive service, did the job in a timely manner, and had good conversation.  Efficient + affordable + friendly = 5 star experience

High quality coffee and friendly/helpful/hipster staff, but soo overpriced. Barrier to entry is high, and for that reason, you lose a star. Sorry, Cartel, but be more affordable to the average folk.

Realllyy fun! I went on a mimosa morning and they provided one drink and complimentary coffee and pastries. The teacher went at a good pace, painting was so fun, and being able to bring it home is awesome. It is great alone or with a buddy, but would also be a great place for a team bonding event or birthday party.  My one qualm was that the instructor kept pushing us to buy drinks. It was really annoying and he kept trying to sell us. It's morning and I'm here to paint fish, not drink like one!

Great ambiance, accommodating staff, great brunch/beer or mimosa deal, unique bloody mary (they make it with beef jerky!). I love coming here for brunch and sitting outside with all the doggies. Make a reservation, but if you don't, it's still worth the wait!

Love the ambiance here. Lots of natural light, open space... Went for brunch and got the mimosa. Took a while because they had to squeeze the oranges #fresh! Everything looked super yummy. I got the superfood salad which was a little heavy on the dressing, but still great. I am going to get the crab benny next time for sure. The waitress was nice, smiley, prompt, and helpful. The live music was charming.

Great airport spot. They serve you drinks in red Solo cups LOL. Wish it wasn't so packed, but I guess that's what happens when you have the best food and drank in the terminal #hype PS I'm the duchess

This place has great food AND great dancing. You can go any time of day or day of the week. The guys that go here are insanely good looking and the girls on the bar are unnaturally fit. It's actually ~wow~ and makes me want to go on a diet but then the food is really good so then I just eat a lot instead.

It's a shame I didn't discover this place until recently. The exterior is kind of sketchy/janky, so for the longest time I thought it was a drug front. Then, one casual Sunday when I was on a Yelp-fueled coffee house extravaganza, I saw Sip had many 5 star reviews. It was only then with the assurance of Yelpers Phoenix-wide, that I dared venture inside and discovered it is a #trendy #hipster PARADISE! I love it here! Great ambiance, great cool brew, great fake flowers, great painted mason jars, great conversation, great staff, great fun signs on the wall, great Instagramming opportunities. I LOVE THIS PLACEEE and it's not a drug front (that I know of)!!!

This place is so bland. Great location, but the food and drinks are dull and consistently disappointing. Additionally, their remodel with the new outdoor patio furniture is tacky. I like bingo night, but the prizes could be better. Overall, this place is major "meh"...

EWWW this place is ratchet. Plz, take my advice, and don't let the nice aesthetics deceive you! The margarita I had here tasted like bath water mixed with Clorox. They even served it to me in a red Solo cup-- I am not sure why because other people got normal glasses. Good vibes here b/c of the outdoor patio, but the service was sh*t (granted, I only went once) and the alcohol was actually AWFUL. Please, if you want a decent drink go ANYWHERE ELSE. If you want a great drink, all you have to do is cross the street and go to RnR...

Overrated. I had been told these sandwiches were "heaven in food form." Not the case.. Don't get me wrong, they're pretty good, but I was severely disappointed. The menage a toi Ike's is famous for was drenched in sauce and just messy. I'm glad I went alone cuz I guarantee that I wasn't pretty eating it lol. Also, kind of weird how narcissistic this Ike man is. Trying to make a brand for himself with his face plastered on the wall, but it is all a little much and the whole rags to riches thing is irrelevant.. I'm here for a sandwich, not your life story and an unmade bow tie, so random. Service was great tho! I really liked everyone working there.  TAKEAWAY: I am definitely going to go back and try something new, but as for now, this place is def overrated and overpriced.
