It's a big airport...but it's also an easy to navigate airport. You won't starve with the food selections, coffee is everywhere and it's fairly clean. I fly in and out of PHX a few times a year and I have never really had any issues. Just be careful existing because one wrong turn and you can wind up on the opposite end of Phoenix and it's a hassle to get back on track.

What's better than a baseball game in 72 degree weather in Arizona?   Not to much, huh?   The Arizona Fall League is one of those things a true baseball fan or anyone looking for a cheap day out can enjoy. $8 for an adult ticket, pick your seat anywhere and enjoy the future of MLB playing in the warm AZ sun.   Scottsdale stadium is clean, the staff is super friendly and it's not uncommon to make friends in the stands. Heck, if you wave at them- the players are always gonna throw you a game ball too. (Got Maddi her first baseball)

We went to see The Avengers today, Less than a dozen people in the theater on a Tuesday afternoon, but I'm not complaining. The seats are comfy, the sound and picture quality was great and it was clean- not sure what else you might be looking for in a movie theater? The staff was also friendly and we would return here to watch another movie.

Ever see back to the future? Well this place was something like that....straight out of the 1960's and probably the using the same booths. We came to Biscuits because my mom swore it was the best breakfast place around...sadly, I disagree. It felt old as soon as we walked in...ripped booths, dirty floors, tired and disinterested staff....actually, I should mention it started in the parking lot- where we were greeted by 3 kitchen employees smoking and leaning on a car (most likely before cooking our breakfast) no one smiled, there was only a handful of other tables...none under the age of 80- and the food was okay. Breakfast is hard- only three ways it can go, amazing, average or terrible. This was average at best. Nothing to brag about and nothing to bring me back. Eggs are eggs- service, decor and a unique menu is what sets the good ones apart from the rest. When in AZ I doubt I would ever return to Biscuits, too many other choices with a lot more to offer.

Pour some water in it....  Seriously.   So last Wednesday my girlfriend took our 16 month old to this facility to get checked for a bad cough. We were visiting AZ and it was local- kids get sick....  After waiting for an hour in an empty lobby (there was one other couple) and 45 mins in a back room a Dr. Finally came in and assisted. Nothing "urgent" about this place so far...a steroid shot and a prescription later and they headed out. Good to know they can handle prescriptions in house and you don't have to go and shuttle around a sick baby to Walgreens. "Give her this, twice a day for ten days" simple enough, right?   Not so much....on the morning of the 7th day we realized that there was no way this medicine was going to last for 10 days- it was going to run out today, day seven. So we drove back down in hopes of getting enough medication to finish the prescribed remedy. Upon arriving we were told they would have to call billing??? Billing didn't help and didn't care. We had two choices...buy another FULL prescription, or as the nurse at the front counter suggested..."maybe you can pour some water in it." This was her suggestion. No thank you. I'm no doctor, but I'm pretty sure that's not how your supposed to go about it.   Needless to say, we will just take our daughter to a pediatrician in the morning.   Kind of reminded me of scrapping my knees when I was a kid and having my Dad tell me, "rub some dirt on it!"   Not exactly sound medical advise :(
