The Heard Museum has a unique menagerie of ancestral and contemporary Native American and Southwestern items in an approachable and interactive atmosphere. Most of my visits have been one of the seemingly innumerable museum sponsored events hosted for local artists or Southwestern festivals. I definitely recommend checking out the market festivals as they always draw interesting and unique local artists and products. As with any museum, the showcase exhibit changes every few months, it's currently themed Native Warriors, in homage to the Navajo Code Talkers. I've been fortunate enough to meet and talk at length to one of the surviving Code Talkers several years ago while helping build a veteran's center in Tuba City, so I'm very much looking forward to the exhibit.

If you understand the differences between absolute and program music and can deliver a dissertation on Baroque, Classical, and Renaissance styles then good for you. Drop me an email because some of it is completely over my head and skip this review because it's not for you.   If your looking for something different, a brief respite to rip you away from the grind and let your mind wander formlessly amid the music then check out the symphony. Despite popular belief there is no formal dress code however you might find a favorable response from your fellow patrons if you wear a shirt and shoes after all this is the symphony not the South. Though some people wear jeans you may feel more comfortable in a pair of slacks or casual business attire but ultimately who cares you paid for a ticket just like everyone else. Largely, the only complaint I can muster are the somewhat cramped seats in Phoenix Symphony Hall. Intermissions usually offer a coffee and cocktail bars. Also make sure and arrive slightly early, while they might not care about how you're dressed, etc. I promise you they absolutely will not let you to the hall after the doors close, you will be stuck in the lobby until the intermission.    Downtown Phoenix and the other symphony venues also offer a variety of wonderful places to dine before or after the performance. The Phoenix Symphony website www.phoenixsymphony.org offers additional information, performance calendars, and ticket sales. Unplug and give it a try.

The Desert Botanical Gardens are not what you think....  Yes, there are innumerable cacti of every shape and type as well as a great many other plants and even the occasional critter ranging from birds and lizards to jackrabbits. Forget all these things because for a great many of you they are only going to offer a very scenic well cultivated backdrop to some wonderful events that the garden hosts including Jazz in the Garden (Fridays March - May), Agave on the Rocks, The Chile and Chocolate Festival, Luminarias (December), and a host of other events and concerts that are extremely well done.   If your looking for a special night or event that blends natural serenity and entertainment into an exquisitely unified package then check out the special events on the Desert Botanical Garden website www.dbg.org (and yes there is booze).

PCG is an excellent place to relax for brunch. You will find courteous staff, excellent table service, and good food. The environment was very laid back and relaxing. Definitely worth checking out if your in the area.

While one of the best steaks I have ever eaten was in a cowboy bar outside of Dallas where there were more teeth on the floor than in the average patron's mouth. I have come to believe that most of us generally desire that unique union of a robust menu composed of carefully planned and executed dishes with a splash of unique drinks, a dazzling wine selection, excellent service that offer suggestions to round out a dining experience, and finally an atmosphere that lets us focus on our palette not our survival instincts. If your generally in agreement with me then the Capital Grille is right up your prospective alley and will definitely set the bar higher.   While the steaks are absolutely excellent, they take a great amount of pride and care in the preparation of everything. Starting with the appetizers, the oyster and shellfish platters were well done and exceptionally fresh especially when you consider we are in the middle of the desert. The Kona Sirlon was cooked to absolute perfection and the rub composed of coffee and other seasonings gave you all the more reason to linger over every bite. The dinner service was absolutely perfect, he remained observant and ensured we were taken care of without being obtrusive seemingly allowing us to dine from the horn of plenty.

La Grande Orange is one of those fantastically energetic smallish neighbor markets that offers an ever shifting and marvelous menagerie of breakfast, take home, and baked items. For years it has successfully maintained a well deserved reputation as a local favorite for numerous meals, the only downside to this quirky Phoenix favorite is that it can become absolutely overrun during breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Breakfast is my personal favorite meal at LGO but don't leave without a salted chocolate chip cookie, I'm absolutely sure that patrons could easily come to blows over ridiculously large sweet and salty treats.

This Sweet Tomatoes is one of my 'work late and try to avoid eating garbage for dinner' gigs, and it's actually very good. The large variety of salad bar ingredients are kept very fresh as you would expect, the staff is very friendly, and the establishment is kept clean. They have a small but well done variety of soups and other hot items that are rotated once a month or so in accordance with the corporate food theme. Overall the price could be a little bit better but it's not unreasonable. Reader be warned that it can get overwhelmingly packed with people during prime time hours at lunch and dinner so try to hit it at off hours.

The Book Gallery is a great cerebral maze to go wander within where a few hours could easily turn into days. Like any self respecting book store it possesses the basic pedigree of a bedazzling selection of sections around everything from the Punic Wars to grooming your Pomeranian. Unlike the most other shops, the Book Gallery manages to pull off said mind bending pedigree with a good selection of the old and the new while avoiding that whole dirty hoarder vibe.  The Arizona section is actually really interesting and includes at least one to two copies of the Kolb brothers famous tome concerning the Grand Canyon as well as more modern books about Arizona.   The layout of the shop is good but I still like the overall semi-mysterious creaky floor vibe, which constantly gives you the impression that you just might find a Mogwai around the next corner.

Excellent ride, it's kind of a mix between a social booze cruise and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Twenty dollars scores you an a leisurely ninety minute tour through a man made Arizona canyon lake with some stunning views. Wild life abounds as we observed bald eagles soaring overhead, various species of ducks quacking along, and were told of bighorn sheep, bobcats, and even mountain lions being present in past excursions. The captain gives it that Marlin Perkins feel and injects quite a lot of interesting facts along with some humor into the trip but is not overbearing as to ruin the relative serenity of the overall experience. We also got to see a few guys on water skis putting on an excellent 'Hey! I am an idiot!' show along with a 1966 Amphicar Model 770 (is it a car? is it a boat?). It was definitely a good time and worth doing again.

Alas Orange Table, your location is excellent and your menu tantalizes. It is grossly unfortunately that the food and location are considerably offset by a staff so rude that it might actually make you entertain the idea of an encounter with flesh eating zombies. The wait times can be measured in a millennial scale as well, the tables seemed to linger uncleaned for quite sometime before anyone could be bothered to tidy them up for the next round of customers. Honestly, we felt as if you could have built the Great Pyramid of Giza in the time it took to get seated. While the Jalape√±o Pecan Pancakes were outstandingly prepared and perhaps even bordering brilliant, I just can't get away from the fact I spend a small lifetime standing about for a seat and would honestly not have been surprised if the wait staff had tried to gnaw off my arm. Overall it presented a vastly disappointing experience.

My wife and I decided to check out the Comedy Spot largely due to the appearance of one of the local Yelpers. The $10 cover charge and two drink minimum were definitely a value.  I was quite impressed with the open mic talent and cordial staff, which speaks positively with regard to the overall management of the club.   The club would be a great place to take a group of people, it has an excellent location (stumbling distance) with regard to numerous restaurants and bars. The interior is a bit cozy, I would estimate seating for less than 100, so reservations seem to be a necessity as the line to get inside far exceeded what was allowed.

If you have a passion for New Mexico style hot and spicy food and you just can't seem to satiate that burning desire for those dishes that make your endorphins dance then Carlsbad Tavern is the cave for you.   Carlsbad Tavern offers a wide variety of New Mexico style dishes that tend to leave the competition behind. People who like it HOT will love this place, those that prefer mild will find it tasty and bearable, and those with no tolerance for the heat should stay away from this kitchen. The restaurant offers a unique large patio complete with waterfalls and a small dining area with a cozy cavern like atmosphere. Beware of sitting near the pick up window during peak hours as it tends to be overly noisy and relatively chaotic.

Let your nose lead the way....  This is one of the few restaurants that can draw you in by olfactory senses alone, thanks to a giant outside rotisserie that seems to excite your senses and it only gets better.  The food is simply wonderful, I recommend trying the Southwest Corn bread appetizer to start off the evening and all of the entrees are extraordinarily well done. I have dined at Bandera numerous times with everyone from in-laws to business associates trying numerous dishes including fish, chicken, lamb, and steaks. The lamb will melt in your mouth, the chicken is wonderful, and the steaks enchilada style are sizzling in more ways than one!   It's been a wonderful experience each time as far as the food and the atmosphere. The lighting is wonderful, it casts a very warm flattering glow over the ugliest of my friends and it is definitely a place to take a date or celebrate with friends. Well over 95% of the time the service is spot on, they are responsive, friendly, accurate, etc.  but there have been a few small preventable mistakes (the nights in question were very busy so it is somewhat understandable).

Defalco's has an excellent variety of sandwiches and salads all rolled up into a cozy little Italian grocery. While the shopping selection is nice (according to my wife) the food borders on fantastic!   Seriously, even the greatest carnivores among us (like me) that normally scoff at a vegetarian entree will buckle for the the mighty Defalco's mozzarella, tomato, basil, olive oil and balsamic vinegar on sub roll.   The service is friendly but the shop can get extremely crowded during peak feeding frenzies. Try to go early or slightly late if possible, you won't be disappointed.

Architecture and Wright fans will find a trek to Taliesin West to be a true treat. The tours only operate from May thru September because the Fellowship (architecture school) winters at Taliesin West and summers at Taliesin East (Spring Green, Wisconsin) beware of the summer months as the heat will definitely distract you and you will not draw as much from the experience. Several types of tours are available including tours of the student architect tents (a Wright tradition where the students had to go build shelters in the desert on the property with a very limited amount of resources) as always you should call ahead to schedule and see what is available. I have taken numerous individuals on the tour and never walked away disappointed, different tour guides see and interpret Wright style and history in different ways thus the experience is slightly unique each time as each offers an enriching perspective. The gift shop has an excellent variety of art, books, DVDs, ties, pens, and other unique items.

Four Peaks in Tempe offers a wide selection of well above average bar food and absolutely great beer in a historically unique and lively environment. Please note that lively means LIVELY, this bar is situated near ASU so you can expect the usual college crowd of students living it up during the school year. Service and security are excellent and I have never witnessed anything get terribly out of hand. If you bring a large group of friends the patio is an exceptional place to situate yourself. The quality and variety of beers (try the beer sampler platter) they offer (especially Kilt Lifter) will keep you coming back again and again.

Mandalay Bay used to be one of my favorite Vegas places, today I find myself wishing 'if only the shiny veneer went a bit deeper'. The check in process was ridiculously long on a Wednesday afternoon, the maid service was utterly dismal (left dirty glasses all over the room), the sink in the room kept backing up, and our bill was wrong at checkout (spurring the process to almost 25 minutes). If your still reading it's worth saying that when I'm on vacation, I am not staying in a bargain basement 'super special rack rate' room which is what made this all the more a bitter pill to swallow. Hopefully they will pull it together again soon, but it's Vegas and those that fall behind soon find the wrecking ball.

We stopped into House of Blues for breakfast thinking what could possibly be simpler than steak and eggs or other simple breakfast fare?   Obviously, quite a lot could be simpler, the first red flag heralding the catastrophe to come was the complete lack of anyone at the ma√Ætre d' kiosk for five minutes. The food was greasy, overcooked, and completely disappointing for the price. The service was amateurish and ghastly at very best. It's probably a better gig if your enjoying a show with a couple of drinks in you.

When your writing the 187th review for a restaurant there is a small part of you that begs to ask the question do you honestly think you have anything new, exciting, or insightful to add..... even Hemingway might have shied away until some prestigious number like 200 rolled around. But I'm sure as hell not Hemingway, so let's roll the dice.  With little doubt it's an absolutely certainty that the food has been glowingly covered in one aspect or another in the previous 186 reviews. It's a sure thing you can randomly pick almost any review and find people raving over Fez burgers, lamb kisra, sweet potato fries, and Hummus. First off the sweet potato fries are good, not just good but the kind of good that they would have burned you at the stake over during  the dark ages, the Catholic church has sins that pale in comparison to the fries. The lamb was at least equally remarkable, in my book if you kill something that sweet and innocent it should at least be handed over to a damn fine kitchen, it melted in your mouth. It was the kind of thing that made you want to go steal a truck load of the little bastards and roll them up to the backdoor of Fez so you could have it all. The desserts will not leave you disappointed, but they will put your dentist's kids through college. The chocolate mousse is so good you'll want to bathe in it, they must have sacked a South American coco plantation for that one.   The bar is well stocked and knows how to put together a strong drink as well. I'm not talking some scamp behind the counter mixing the modern day equivalent of pirate grog, the drinks are good but still nothing short of what you would use to load up dart on the African savannah to knock down a bull elephant. Definitely takes the edge off a bad day.  The restaurant interior is contemporary yet comfortable with excellent lighting. I'm sure in the previous 186 reviews some poor bastard that was hard up for something new to say has even remarked about the bathrooms being well decorated and clean. He would be right but still you poor sod, get a life and talk about the patio or something entertaining. The only issues I've ever had at Fez have been service related, while the staff have always been professional and very friendly, there have been several times when the service was a tad spotty respective to drink refills, informing the dinner party of the specials, and minor issues like the time the server expected me to tackle cutting my steak with a spoon.  Obviously, you don't write the 187th review for fortune and glory. At this stage it's all about the statistical base respective to enforcing that Fez is an excellent restaurant and that if you haven't checked it out yet then you're obviously missing something.

I have frequented ZuZu numerous times for dinner with family or friends and never walked away disappointed. While the food is essentially simple it tends to be very well done as you would expect for the price.   The iceberg lettuce wedge salad was absolutely ridiculously big, I suggest splitting it unless you plan on grazing for awhile. The grilled salmon, ahi tuna salad, and beef stroganoff have all been proven to be consistent palette pleasers and the Bourbon Mac Daddy from the bar was perfect. Dinner service has always been prompt and friendly but not intrusive. Obviously, a booth is quite nice for a small party or a couple on a date, they are relatively cozy, somewhat quieter than the main floor, and have excellent lighting. The decor is relatively contemporary, as you would expect in Scottsdale/Valley Ho with a sprinkle of Frank Loyd Wright's influence in the central columns, but largely has a very relaxed and warm feeling. As a springtime alternative they also have a wonderful outdoor patio.  ZuZu is quite popular on Friday and Saturday nights thus if possible I strongly recommend reservations or trying to go on off peak days for a more enjoyable dining experience. If you do decide to pop in at the last minute and are faced with a consequential wait there is a very relaxed bar adjacent to ZuZu in the lobby of the Valley Ho which you could easily pass the time.   Cafe ZuZu website (menus and reservations are all online): http://www.hotelvalleyho.com/content/fooddrink/cafezuzu.html

Part of the beauty of Vegas is the ambition to stuff the entire world into less than four square miles of the Nevada desert. Egyptian pyramids, pirate ships, rock stars, the Eiffel tower, and the entire city of New York all vie for your attention and coin. The Phantom represents part of the best of the best. An array of outstanding talent, seemingly flawless execution, spectacular costumes, and a dash of Vegas ambition transform a hundred year old opera into a globally accessible technicolor powerhouse. It's quite simply one hell of a show.

Dozo is one of my favorite neighborhood places to eat. The restaurant is clean and quiet, they have friendly expedient service, and a very good selection of Japanese dishes, sushi, and some desserts. The restaurant reminds me of the standard faire of cozy mom and pop restaurants that dotted the landscape outside of Amori or Hachinohe Japan in the years that I lived there. If the quality of the food is more important than a trendy location then give Dozo's a shake.

Get your game on!   This place is a 24x7 hardcore gamers paradise. No matter what kind of Magic, Pokemon, Warhammer, Warhammer 40K, Dungeons & Dragons, World of Darkness, and traditional board games, etc. gear you seek they are very likely to have what you need to get your satiate your game fix. They also have a $1 per hour game LAN set up with WoW, Steam, and all your other MMORPG and frag festival favorites. If you've just moved to the area and are trying to find like minded peeps or have never played and wish to learn do not despair as they host numerous events for various game groups including learner sessions. I have also been rather impressed with the general friendliness of the staff as well as that of the patrons as well. Check the website for event schedules and times.  http://www.gamersinnaz.com/

Take a group and go late.  There are two key issues that present hurdles to having an all around good time at Dave and Busters. The first issue is the food is terribly overpriced and the quality was not impressive as I have found it to be greasy at times or overcooked. The second issue revolves around the bloody ankle biters, why you would want to drag your kids to a bar is far beyond me (I do however see why having kids can make you want to drink heavily) so the only obvious circumvention is to go later in the evening to avoid the annoyance. The variety of arcade games is not bad. They have several group play racing and trivia games but they are missing some staple crowd pleasing games like air hockey and strangely absent are the fighting style games (Tekken, Street Fighter, Mortal Combat, etc.).     In a nutshell go later in the evening with a group for the games and stick to a simple faire of bar food or you might find yourself sorely disappointed. Tempe Market Place is a great place to wonder around in this time of year (spring) with a variety of restaurants, shops, etc. Dave and Busters is worth spending an hour or two in but if you want decent food I would look elsewhere.

Miller Barber Shop not only offers an excellent haircut but a great experience as well. The facility is clean, the staff are friendly, and the service is second to none. The barbers give exceptional attention to even the minor details ensuring that you have a first class hair cut. Individuals used to the mall style hair cut cattle calls are in for a real treat and you will be loathe to return to the corporate cookie cutter experience.  I happily frequent this establishment on a monthly basis.

In the strange tapestry of culinary Americana few things are capable of firing up the salivary glands like a damn fine burger and Lucky Boy has the MOJO! As food goes the burger is one of those things that couldn't get any more American unless of course you wrapped up a little blond in an American flag and had her working the grill. No matter where you find yourself from Manhattan to Monterey Bay you can always find a burger joint.   In a town rife with everything from exotic grinds of meat to log cabin themes for burger bars, Lucky Boy has a mind boggling simple cheap formula, a non-mad cow burger made with all the of the basic ingredients like onions, tomatoes, lettuce, pickles, and assorted other condiments cooked to order on a fresh bun. Toss in some fries, onion rings, maybe even fried mushrooms sprinkle in milkshakes for real pizazz.

The deco has a selectively modern but comfortably confused 60's beatnik feel which conveyed an overall cozy atmosphere with intelligently mixed and versatile seating that can accommodate small to large parties. The acoustics inside the restaurant are terrible, much akin to having a pair of highly sensitive hearing aids shoved into both ears and being forced to sit in front of speakers at a heavy metal concert. It would definitely be great place to take a date just not a first date where you have to actually act interested in what they are saying. Perhaps it wasn't the natural acoustics as much as it was the party of short bus corporate apes that we were sitting next to, it wasn't bad enough they had bull horns but someone kept feeding them booze.   The menu is excellent most of the dishes are targeted to sail past the mundane competition but the serving sizes leave much to be desired. Quite simply I am a fat American bastard as such I expect a restaurant to roll out a veritable pig trough full of gourmet food, european/french serving sizes do nothing to win my favor especially when I am paying premium prices in Scottsdale for flat iron steaks and house salads. Dessert was the notable exception regarding serving size, my wife and I were quite pleased to not receive a smurf sized dessert portions. In fact two areas of exceptional excess were the dessert portion size and the bar, I am absolutely convinced that the bartender is attending some type of veterinary school because the drinks seemed to be potent enough to load into darts for taking down large land mammals. While your here go ahead and consider taking the bohemian dive and dance with the green fairy (aka try the absinthe), anything that was illegal for almost 80 years has to be worth a try, I'm sure that is what our grandchildren will be saying about marijuana when they legalize it 80 or so years from now. Overall, I was quite impressed with the menu selection, staff, bar, etc.

We've done breakfast and dinner here.  Breakfast was punctuated by that awesome airy bakery smell, fresh orange juice, great coffee, excellent service, and gourmet breakfast sandwiches. Lots of people love to rave about the Breakfast Club in Scottsdale but sorry for me, Scratch has it beat.... clobbered even.  Dinner was also an excellent treat punctuated with great service and great food. The duck was crispy but not greasy and the potatoes were cooked very well but needed a pinch of salt and a little more seasoning overall.

If good food, excellent service, and bartenders that mix drinks strong enough to knock a bull elephant to it's knees aren't enough for you then perhaps all these and the lure of a mechanical bull will do the trick.   First and foremost, the food was good. The selection will definitely appeal to the man's man with a variety of bar appetizers and entrees including beef, pulled pork sandwiches, burgers, chicken, and some fish. The Bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer was decent (the cornbread was a tad dry), I found the Tempe Burger to be a tasty treat, make sure they bring your BBQ sauce on the side as most chains will slather it on obliterating the taste of the burger and my dinner companion had no complaints about the Phoenix Cheesesteak. The beer selection was average with respectable variety of domestic and imported brands and the bar did not skimp in the slightest on booze. The service was friendly and prompt, very responsive but not intrusive. The deco is the outcome of a Rock N' Roll tornado colliding with the Beverly Hill Billies (Rock-A-Billy) the Ranch also has a great deck which overlooks a busy pedestrian crosswalk near Dave and Busters (a potential spot for a bit of after dinner fun).  If all of this isn't enough and you just want MORE then nothing can top off a night of drinking or excite a designated driver like the prospect of a passenger that had a heavy night of drinking and finished it off with the ever so gentle swaying of a mechanical bull. Oh yes, just imagine the possibilities!

Let's imagine we are writing something for an Internet dating site for a minute. Obviously, unlike most people on Internet dating sites we are actually going to be honest.   Top Two Turn Ons: 1. Getting that super sexy 'I've been swindled' feeling. Yes, I totally dig paying 10-20% more than I should, and find exquisite delight in the gamer version of 'Catholic Guilt'. In fact, going to the poor house is soundly embedded in all aspects of my current and future financial planning.   2. Emotional games, I just can't get enough of the totally pushy sales hot shoulder approach and/or the total screw you, you don't exist cold shoulder attitudes. I don't know if your going to hump my leg like an overzealous puppy or douse me with lighter fluid and go with the burn baby burn approach, but I love the total honesty of how you let your feelings show.  If either one of these remotely describe your turn-ons then look no farther because Game Stop is your totally awesome perfect match! You will be poorer, pushed around, and abused at times but each of us has our own ideas of happiness and I wish you the best.

When you take on an establishment like ice cream you better have a damn good idea. Rolling out a dozen deviations of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry flavor X may work for a summer time smash and grab shop but if your going to thrive and ultimately shatter perspective you have to have an ice cream flavor renaissance.   Like bacon... or sweet corn.... or rosemary..... or a mojito recipe  When I first heard of bacon flavored ice cream, I was utterly horrified, this sounds like some fiendish experiment played out by a fictional madman like Dr. Frankenstein. But still I'll try anything once and pay my cardiologist to worry about it later. I can't possibly warn you enough, it's like crack, who knew.... But enough about my impending doom.  Sweet Republic truly soars above the competition, the innovation and product quality are simply outstanding. We have gone back numerous times and never been disappointed. The staff is excellent, the decco is dynamic, and of course the ice cream is world class. If you don't believe me just ask the flag burning liberal hippies at the New Times or the arrogant food snobs at Bon App√©tit.

Building a Ski Lodge theme restaurant in the middle of the desert can only be construed in one of two ways either your a complete madman deserving of a very long sleeved dinner jacket or brilliant with regard to a tactic respective of Sun Tzu if he was a restaurant owner. You can almost hear him plotting that the idea is so solid that you'll be hitting the cookie cutter contemporary Scottsdale crowd from an angle they will never see  coming, then again maybe they're just crazy.  The interior is roomy, comfortable, and even exuded a warm friendly feeling, it stuck me as the kind of place I would gather some friends and might approach a potentially irresponsible level of inhibriation at complete ease. The menu was an assortment of solid bar type food with the necessary additions to keep people interested and coming back to try something different each time. It was a relatively cold day outside so I tried a simple grilled cheese and soup. I thought it was all rather well prepared, mixed cheeses, tomatoes, not too greasy or watered down by the tomatoes. The sweet potato fries I gleefully stole from my wife's plate were also well done. I'll happily return.

Imagine your a hungry lion, locked in a shopping mall full of people. They are athletic, unarmed, and some of them have been good enough to coat themselves in A1 or barbecue sauce. Welcome to the Fogo de Chao experience.  Meat orgy! It's absolutely magnificent, take over half a dozen different piping hot well prepared varieties of meat including top sirloin, bottom sirloin, Filet Mignon, pork loin, beef ribs, pork ribs, and lamb stuffed onto skewers that could double as props for a film about Roman gladiators. Hand said savory redolent skewers to an assorted band of servers that seem to dance in and out of crowded tables full of people with amazing ease all at the beck and call of a little piece of paper. It's fantastic! They have wonderful sides as well including caramelized bananas, polenta, and garlic mashed potatoes. There is also a salad bar, and I think it was nice but quite honestly wasn't the analogy about the damn lion the point here?  Happy hunting.

Losing a longtime pet is an emotionally brutal experience that makes ultimate pit fighting look like a lively game of patty cake.   Without going into emotionally overbearing or even morbid detail I will say that Fairwinds exists to help you take care of the final details for your beloved companion. First and foremost, I was very impressed with Mary's professionalism, kindness, and deep sincerity. She explained and ensured that we understood the details of what was happening and what was going to happen.  The process was very well organized, and she stayed in contact with us throughout. It is also worth noting that Fairwinds offers a good array of services and resources with respect to giving you the opportunity to say good-bye in your own way.  Obviously, it's impossible to be completely emotionally detached when you're writing a review of something like this; as such, all I can say is that I felt that Mary and Fairwinds helped us take care of our family in a time of need.

The Wandering Horse is a really well done buffet that I have found to be consistently clean with an very good selection of fresh items and friendly if occasionally spotty table service. The buffet offers a standard blend of the tried and true steak, prime rib, salad bar combo with a nice blend of Mexican, Italian, Asian selections as well.  I've eaten here at least 15 times since they opened, entertaining in-laws, business associates, and friends for lunch, dinner, and brunch having never left hungry or disappointed in anything save for the soups. Service has gotten consistently better and the food has stayed very consistently good. I would love to give five stars but on numerous occasions the soups have been under-seasoned and terribly bland.

Excellent go to type of place to grab an average slice of pizza, wings, beer, etc. I've dined here for lunch and dinner numerous times. The staff have always been friendly, the food has been average but very consistent, and even when it's really busy the service is generally quick.

Flowers should not just be for a special occasions like anniversaries or birthdays or when you seriously screw up and find yourself staring into the doghouse. Overall, it was great; Rachel is very helpful, the flowers lasted quite awhile, and my wife thought the arrangement was great. Definitely a florist worth adding to your speed dial if you screw up on a regular basis. Also take note that Scratch Pastries is right down the street for those occasions when you really want to create a special moment after flooding the house or burning down your kitchen.

I've done several arrangements with Flora Unique now and it's nice to say this place still rocks. I unfortunately know these things because I am a very frequent patron of the doghouse.  Rachel is very helpful, and will be more than happy to do arrangements with a more modern feel that really set themselves apart.

This is a great little restaurant with a northern Indian and Pakistani slant.   The restaurant is unfortunately well off the beaten path and most likely struggles because of a poor location. The prices are very good with a very polite wait staff that were generally on top of things, we did have to wait a bit long for the appetizer (Pakora) from the kitchen. The restaurant was simple and clean and most importantly the food (Paya and Chicken Qorma) was actually quite good. Definitely worth checking out.

Fantastic and fun MTV music video style 80's bar located off the casino floor of The Venetian, the mood is upbeat and Mike is a friendly and fantastically engaging VJ. The bar can get a bit loud in the evening when Mike takes the stage otherwise it's a very comfortable place to chill out and chit chat with friends over drinks.

The short story is I've been going here for well over a year and it's been great.   The longer version goes like this. During the one year I have been going here, I have had my hair cut by Boris, Ruben, and several others. The experience and staff interactions have been consistently professional and friendly always showing attention to detail and overall great service. I strongly recommend giving Shaving Grace a try.
