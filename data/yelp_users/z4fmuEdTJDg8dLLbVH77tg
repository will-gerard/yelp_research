Today was my first visit to All Smiles. Aubrey was fantastic! She told me more about my teeth than anyone ever has and she is fixing them too. I will be back in two weeks so Dr. Smith can repair a bad cavity repair from the past. The support staff was very friendly! I recommend this dental practice to everyone!!

My Mom, sister and I stayed at Sanctuary Resort on the 4th of July.  The experience was magnificent!  From my first encounter with Ryan at Valet to Katy our server at the restaurant to the best meal any of us had ever had from their Iron Chef.  The room was perfect in every way for the luxury seeker!  I cannot wait for the next opportunity to stay there again...

For those of you that are not aware Macayo's has a new 'concept.'  It stinks!!  The menu is different, the chairs and tables are different, the signage and paint on the exterior is different however the carpet is the same the old tile is the same and the restrooms are the same.  A very half assed attempt.  When we asked to speak to a manager about the changes we were met with aggression and zero empathy.  As a result, we paid for our cocktails, refused the food and left the restaurant.  Even though my family and I have been going to Macayo's for as long as I can remember we will never return.  My family tradition has been ruined!

New employee made a mistake. It happens to all of us. When I called back to make them aware of the problem Kevin and the delivery driver made everything ok! The quality was great and the students of ITT Tech will continue to order from our local Pizza Hut. Thank you from Tracy!
