Very clean movie theater and self serve concessions!   I don't live in Vegas and a friend brought me here because it's his local theater. The whole connected to the casino is a little interesting to me, but it does give you something to do if you arrive a little early. They didn't have an issue with bringing in my Starbucks. The concessions are a little expensive. I live in Chicago and popcorn doesn't cost $8 there and our cost of living is much higher than Vegas.   Overall a nice theater.

Gorgeous hotel! I was here for a conference and the staff at the hotel really took care of us.   The views alone are 5 stars. Simply magnificent.  Don't worry my little yelpers, I'll attach pics :) As I'm from the chilly Midwest I took every opportunity to relax outside and enjoy the sunshine and clear skies.  My room was awesome. Being Starwood preferred has its perks. Private balcony with a view of the pool and golf course was great.   The only issue I have is the food. Not really that good. I stayed at this hotel for a week. I had a chance to sample pretty much every food concoction their chef could come up with. Every meat dish I had was not seasoned. Zero flavor. Even their carved roast had no flavor. One evening we had pulled pork and the driest chicken I've ever tasted. For breakfast, I did enjoy their chorizo, onion, green pepper and spicy cheese egg scramble. I think they may have gotten a lot of compliments about it because they served it 3 days in a row. Ugh. Also if you plan on eating at pool bar you will experience the slowest service ever. It took an hour for them to make my salad. I kid you not. Iceberg lettuce and cheese takes an hour to make.   The gym was decent. A few treadmills, elliptical machines and bikes. A lot of weights which impressed me. Normally you don't find a lot of weights at a hotel gym.   The housekeeping staff and various staff maintaining the property were extremely friendly and made a point to call me by name every time they saw me (I think the dumb name tag my company made me wear helped with this. Haha). But it was still nice to have them say hello in the halls.  Overall, a great hotel. Just need to work on the food.

I will NEVER rent from Hertz again!!  Hertz rental is quite possibly the worst rental agency ever. Unorganized and you will spend at least an hour getting a car and returning the vehicle is a nightmare as well  Talk about unorganized and slow. It usually takes maybe 5 min to check out a vehicle and less than that to turn it in. Just pull up hand over the keys, they check the miles and gas, hand you a receipt and you're on your way. Not at this Hertz.   Hertz is not the preferred rental agency for my company but I purchased a rental on Hotwire because I combined a little fun with my business trip. Cheap rental? Check.   Get to hertz after I land and of all the rental car agencies Hertz was the only one with a line. Over 50 people waiting and more were coming behind me. They didn't have enough check in agents working and trying to use their computer kiosk to bypass the line was a bust because the computers were down. Ugh.   An hour in line later and I finally get to the desk. The agent is out of the mid size vehicle I requested. Heck he's out of everything except gas guzzling full size SUVs. But he'll upgrade me for just $70/day. Heck no! I told him he'd give me a car at the $17.95 rate I pre purchased on Hotwire or else. It took my request to speak to a manager before I was given an "upgraded" Prius for the original price. Another 30 minutes of my life I can't get back.   Rental car return: pull up and wait because there's only 2 agents checking in vehicles. If you trust them to correctly document your miles and gas go ahead and leave and you should, hopefully, get a receipt emailed to you. After the nightmare I experienced at check in I decided to wait. After standing there for about 10 minutes a porter walked up asked me if he could help. He wrote down the miles and gas and escorted me to a manager. I bypassed everyone in line because of this kind gentleman. I told his manager to give him a raise and I tipped him for being so helpful.   Sadly, everyone is still waiting to check in their vehicles as I write this. Good luck catching your flights.

This place is cool in a cheesy, fun way.   Cowboys, shoot outs and your drunken uncle are all roaming around. Not kidding there's a guy pretending to be a drunk cowboy. He's great comic relief.   The shoot outs are pretty regular and entertaining. Heck if you're standing close enough  they will probably use you as an extra.   I think I ate half a cow for dinner. The beef ribs were tender and seasoned perfectly. The tri tip was delicious! I could cut it with a butter knife. I also tried their baked beans which were ok. Beans are just a filler anyway. Back to the meat. The BBQ chicken required a bib-just the way I like it. Don't tell my grandfather but their BBQ sauce was better than his!   The comedy show featuring Wild Bill was cheesy. I'm sure my little nephew would've done a better job jumping off the roof in a death fall. I didn't expect Michael Bay special effects so the show met my expectations.   Overall fun for the whole family.

NO STROLLERS ALLOWED!!! What?! Is that not the best sign ever?! No kiddies running around this casino, folks.   I've stayed in practically every hotel on the strip and I must say, The Wynn and its staff impressed me. From the smooth check-in, to the smiles that greeted me all around the casino, this place exudes class.   I'm not a gambler, am allergic to cigarette smoke, don't drink  and really only visit Sin City for work purposes. I'm not a happy person when I have to visit this place. However, staying at the Wynn I had plenty to do and experience outside of the normal Vegas activities.  The pool area is fantastic. Clean and the DJ is jamming all day. Snacks and food is available poolside.   My room had a gorgeous view of the golf course with floor to ceiling windows. Everything is automated in the room. Front the drapes to lighting. The bathroom is a woman's dream. Spacious and perfect lighting to put on my make up. And I watched tv while getting ready.   The gym has a ton of machines. I woke up every morning around 6 am to work out and never waited for a cardio machine or the weights. But it could be the $15 usage fee that no one wants to pay. Frees up machines quickly.   I didn't visit the buffets or restaurants as my company had everything catered while I was there. However, my compliments to the chef. Making edible food in mass quantities is not an easy feat. The best dessert ever? The Cupcake Experience. Oh my goodness! Every cupcake combo imaginable. I was in a sugar coma.   All this and it's located across the street from the Fashion Show mall. If you need a last minute outfit or shoes, you're covered.   The Wynn is my new go to hotel in Vegas.

Wow! It's a mini Wrigley Field!! Loving this!!  5 stars for the ambiance and seating. There really isn't a bad seat in the house. And they serve Giordanos deep dish at the stadium! It was like being at a home game. The crowd was awesome.   3 stars for parking. I'm a stickler for organization. How hard is it to regulate the parking situation? Why aren't there signs posted telling you the lot you've parked in? (Yes I'm one of those people that must write down the letter, number or animal section because I will forgot. Sigh. I can never remember where I leave my car.).   Overall, I was very impressed to have a taste of Chicago while visiting Phoenix. Good times. Sadly the Cubs lost, but then again I'm used to them losing ;)
