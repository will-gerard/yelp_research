I definitely did not like this place! I found it odd that it's ok to put your raw meat into a bowl, then go to the vegi area and mash your vegis into the raw meat and place the spoon you used, that now has raw meat juices on it ,  back into the  community vegi  bowl. I don't eat chicken.  The thought of someone's chicken juice, laden spoon being put back into the broccoli  grosses me out!!  It's very overwhelming. There are too many choices. I swear I got twinges in my stomach after I ate there.

Excellent food !! Went for breakfast, loved the frittata and jalape√±o bacon. Looked at lunch dinner menu looks tasty!! Will be back next week to try dinner. The owners and chefs attention to detail is evident in the ambience and menu.
