I go to Chipotle a lot and I've been to this location about 3 time and every time I do I regret it. Tonight was the last time I will ever go here.  I ordered a vegetable bowl and and my mom was about to ordered one as well, the veggies were old and soggy and the rice was dry. They used the last of the veggies on my bowl and said they were out when my mom ordered. We told them we would wait for fresh ones to be made and they said it was the last of them for the night, that they weren't making anymore. I looked down at my phone and it was only 8:10, and asked why not? And he said because they ran out for the night. So we get down to the register and saw them cutting fresh vegetables up and we asked why can't they use those? We thought they were out? And the girl at the register said they were for tomorrow ...-_- what? Just young kids working who don't give a shit about costumer service or pleasing costumers. Super disappointed in the lack of respect.  Do yourself a favor and just go to a different location

I work next to this location of Rubio's and I come here all the time! It's always good friendly fast service. Sometimes they even give me free chips (I love their chips so this is a plus! ;) lol) I've never had Rubio's before going to this location and I love it now.  I usually get the Gourmet Shrimp Tacos with double chips. Or the California bowl with chicken is filling and delicious as well.

I love this place. My favorite is the Rootbeer Joelatte  (Rootbeer ice with vanilla ice cream). The ice is thick and creamy and same goes for the icecream. Any time I go and they don't have Rootbeer I'm likely to get another flavor that I'll love :)

My friends and I come here every Wednesday night. It's clean, the hookah is the best I've ever had (been going to hookah bars around the valley since 18yrs old), the employees and owner are really nice and always make sure our coal is good, and the best part- they don't play the music so loud you can't hear the person sitting next to you. Overall great experience everytime I come here :)

Truly wasn't an awful experience. I've been dreading the idea of getting a new social card since I moved and lost my old one. Woke up early and went to the Mesa location just to find out they don't issue applications for social security card renewals so I drove down to Phoenix where they told me to go. The parking lot was filled and kinda hard to find a parking spot. The security guard was actually pretty pleasant, very nice and friendly man. The waiting room was just about full which obviously ruins your mood a little but I was maybe there an hour before my number got called. The lady who did the application was really nice and patient and I was out of the in no time. Pretty pleased with my experience here. I see a lot of bad reviews on Google and other locations of the social security offices so I thought I'd share mine not great, but not so bad experience.

Late at night and I locked my keys in my car, absolutely no one available besides West Valley Locksmith and thank god too! Mikes costumer service was awesome and they got my keys out in no time! Very thankful and if I do it again (which I probably will lol) I will be sure to use their service again!
