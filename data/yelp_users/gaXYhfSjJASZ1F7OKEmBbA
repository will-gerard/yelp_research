Best Buy at fiesta Mall as always they open up at 10 o'clock which is inconvenient for most people before going to work you should open at nine at least  Most of the customer service reps there don't know what they're doing,  they act like they do but they don't!.. You're better off going to Fry's Electronics in Tempe which opens up at 8 o'clock in the morning and have better knowledgeable skilled people!

More Furniture is the Best Furniture Store in the Valley.  After visiting many Furniture Stores, we found the the Nicest Furniture for the Money.  Nicholaus Voss and Brandon were excellent.

Beware of the Attitude they give you through the drive thru.  I've never been asked for an ID with a debit card purchase in 10 Years at this Panda Express location. The moment I asked why the ID, the first thing that came out of the mouth of the young girl cashier was "you don't have to give me attitude".  I asked for their Manager and the person on duty said it was a policy they sometimes do. I guess they can racially profile their customers whenever they choose too.

Awesome prices on NAME BRAND clothing! I spent hundreds here but it was worth it at 50% to 60% off!

Incredible fast professional service!  I had a flat tire situation and went to them over Discount Tire Co.  They provided me a free tire fix (bolt in threads) at no charge ( wow - shocked) I will now continue to use them when needed - I highly recommend them!

Don't pawn here.   customer service is very bad... They will cheat you on the fair market price on a pawned item...  They seem to use eBay as a reference for prices which they shouldn't!.  All other items are overpriced In the store!.  I had to wait in line for 10 minutes while the customer service reps stood there chatting amongst themselves about guns and stuff...  wow!  On my next visit which I may not do I will be sure to ask for names so that I can put them on yelp!.  Hopefully somebody higher up in corporate management will see this and maybe do something about it unless they think the same as this stores manager and customer service reps!

Today at QT...  I realized how easy it would be for some fucked up person or Terrorist home grown or not could easily poison the Sugars and Coffee Creamers with no problem (Rat Poison is the first to come to mind then some other Biological powder). How many people could or would be affected in this deadly scenario on a daily basis! I asked the counter person for their corporate number and told them my concern doubting they would do anything anyway.  What do you think?.  Should I make a big deal out of this and have their corps office do something to prevent this idea come to life ( like the Tylonal tampering that killed many people many years ago.  This concern also pertains to many other stores like #Qt  - Today I think I just might start some kind of advocacy website or Facebook page that brings everybody's daily concerns up front and heard!  At my age I'm starting to see the light and how there are so many things around that nobody ever speaks about. We live in a different world know and I understand that our government continues to try to protect us on minute by minute basis but little things that we can do can make a big difference around the world.  What do you think?. Should I try to make a difference by keeping my eyes open and saying something or just follow the pack and figure someone else will take care of it?
