Absolutely love this dental office and staff. They are the most thoughtful group. I have anxiety with dentist visits, but here they are proactive to help.    Looking for a great dentist and hygienist, come to Heatherwood.

Not happy.  I live in the neighborhood and only need plummer's putty $3.75.  Told that I have to make a min $10 purchase with a debit card.  We purchase items consistently from this store, not any more. We'll find a new place for our business.

We decided to try delivery Chinese food for dinner. The lady who took out order was very nice and patient even with the constant phone ringing in the background.  We had the Walnut Shrimp which was delicious but a small order for the price.  The Chicken Chow Mein with crispy noodles, Kung Poa Chicken and Egg Flower soup were good size portions, warm and delicious.  Delivery was said to be 45 min, but we got our order sooner.  For Delivery Chinese food, we'll keep Abacus Inn's phone number for next time.

We had our anniversary dinner at Tarbell.  The service and food was wonderful. I plan to return with my family very soon.

We were in the area and hungry. Yelped and found Caramel's. Breakfast was quick and delicious. Very homemade with great homebrewed coffee and hot chocolate.  The apple muffin was also very delicious. Seating was located inside and outside so we chose to sit outside. Weather was very nice; towards the end of our meal we came across some really bad smells from the surrounding area.  It is my understanding that this location will be moving soon. I would definitely come back for the food and to experience their new location. I would recommend for a good breakfast that is slightly high priced, but with large portions.

My friend and I after a networking event decided to get a quick bite to eat. We checked out Yelp for pizza & wine and found this wonderful place.  Loved the quiet relaxed atmosphere and great service! We ordered the pizza and wine special for the evening and had the fun talking with our great sever Adryan.  We will most definitely be back.  Great for an intimate dinner for 2 or girl night for pizza and wine.

This was my second visit but this time for lunch and with my husband. I wanted him to try the Margherita pizza which I enjoyed my first time. It was cold outside so we both got the Normandy brie soup with black truffle.  This was a little salty for my taste but still delicious. The service and food has been consistently good.  This is a place you can go with some friends or on a date.  I'll be back with my husband and friends for dinner soon.
