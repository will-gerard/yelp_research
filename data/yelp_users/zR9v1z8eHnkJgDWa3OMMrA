After getting a custom airbrush tan at Bronze Buddha Glow I looked perfect for my event. Jayd mixed the color so well the outcome was a completely natural glow. She was very informative about before and after procedures so my tan lasted.The whole experience was very professional and comfortable. I would highly suggest getting your airbrush tans with Jayd!

Unfortunately quite a disappointment, came for restaurant week as the menu looked so delicious but we not only dealt with horrible service but overly cooked and super salty food. My group had to send back two meals. I appreciate the manager trying to rectify the situation but there was definitely insincerity in his offer. I honestly don't think I'll ever come back. I am not a difficult person to please and I'm sad to say this is the first negative review I have ever written.
