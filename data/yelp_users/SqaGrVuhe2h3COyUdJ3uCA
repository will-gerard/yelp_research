Love the coffee, teas and smoothie! Worth the wait but the music is too loud. Love how they have a stamp card, your 11th drink is free!

My family and I have been coming here for over 20 years. It's run by two very nice and friendly Vietnamese sisters.   They cut very fast and the wait is never long. They do CASH ONLY. I've never had a problem with them cutting my hair. It's always been great! $8!!!

It was slow. Found a bug on the food and also was over charged on our bill

This place is just amazing! Nice and friendly staff. Will go back for sure! They also give out great tips on how to treat whatever area you're going to get wax for a better looking result
