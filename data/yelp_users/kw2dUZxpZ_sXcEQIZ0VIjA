Can I give no stars.  What a horrible place to get service work done. got an estimate for tune up on a hedge trimmer and a weed eater.   So the hedge trimmer they gave me a horrible estimate that was more than double what it should have been when I said no they told me I owed a 18 dollar fee for the estimate and said I should just leave the trimmer since it is not worth any thing.  I ended up selling for 150 on craigs list FYI with out the tune up.   they even charged to add string to test the weed eater.  Place is a total rip off I will never go again.

Great office. Had an exam and contact fitting with Dr. Kim Hardin.  Dr. Hardin is a true professional who came highly recommended.  I ended up purchasing new sunglasses too.

Great staff.   Hours of operation are incredible open really late.  Great place to bring your sick pet.

My vet Maya is amazing.   Such a caring person and truly a cat lover.    My cat benjy has been through quite an array of issues and the Scottsdale cat clinic has been amazing.

Zero stars actually.     I just called in to have my asthma inhaler refilled as I had misplaced it.  I called in early in the morning was told it would not be a problem.   I never heard back so at 3:15 I called again. After sitting on hold for 15 minutes the office manager picked up and gave me a very hard time about this saying that they may not get this out today. But she will call me with an update and told me I should go to an urgent care if I need my inhaler.   What the heck is the point of having you as my Doctor if I have to go to an urgent care.  How about do your job lady!!!!!!!!!!    Well you guessed it.  No call back and now I have to go through a weekend with no inhaler.   Oh and this office bribes people with a $30.00 incentive for positive reviews pretty pathetic, that they still have more poor reviews.

I have been under Tom's care on and off for 10 years.    He is very knowledgeable and have always felt comfortable with being in his care.   Staff is great too.

Food is great.   The Chop is my favorite.   Drink menu and bartending skills are top notch.

Great burger and fries for the money. Had a basic cheese burger and it was amazing.   The place seemed a bit dirty not horrible but they could use some help cleaning up.

One of my favorite dives in all of Phx metro.   Pizza is amazing.   The homemade chees esticks could be the best I have ever had.    Also the Italian beef is solid.

I actually go here for the sandwiches not the pizza.  The pizza is 3 star.  But the sandwiches are boars-head meats, Served on a homemade toasted sub roll.   They are amazing.    Get a ham and turkey with melted provolone.    One of the best sandwiches in town.

One of my favorite new lunch spots.  Great concept for individual pizzas.    Also the lemonades are fantastic.
