I used to work near the downtown Scottsdale area and being an Indian food lover I've eaten at Jewel of the Crown many times. Each time I was disappointed.   I've ordered lamb biryani and the rice was mushy and looked at though all of the ingredients were tossed together like a pilaf as opposed to a biryani.   The dhals I've ordered have been decent but nothing really special. A lot of the dishes taste similar with a generic flavor as opposed to being spiced individually for meats vs. dhals vs. vegetables.  My other complain is the staff refusing to believe I like my food spicy. I have a problem with this in a number of restaurants that assume that due to being a whitey I'm not SERIOUS about wanting my food spicy. SERIOUSLY, I want it HOT. Sheesh.  Their one saving grace is their neebo pani (lemon water), their spice mix for the drink is wonderful.

I think half the fun of a used bookstore is the treasure hunt.  This used bookstore is better organized than some of my old haunts in Dallas but I will survive.  I think of used bookstores similar to looking through your Grandmother's attic at her book collection - it isn't supposed to be all shiny and new.  Bookman's has a decent selection of books, I've found an entire collection of Rishdie one afternoon! Of course it is always going to be a crapshoot but that is just the way it is in used books.

When we are in the mood for some North Indian style MEAT we head to Tandoori Times.  I've eaten at both Tandoori Times locations and both are delicious. My only complaints are that some of the dishes are a little heavy on the oil but that can be typical for some Indian places - especially those that are more Pakistani in nature and they do not offer much of a vegetarian selection.  We taken family and friends to this restaurant, some of which have never had Indian food, with great success. The food is generic enough for the American palette but still delicious for those of us that huff spices in our spare time.  I've yet to try their Chaat on the weekends but I'm dying to do so!

My husband and I were meandering about downtown prior to going to the Dodge Theatre and we happened upon Thai Elephant. The interior is small and cozy with a relaxing decor.  We sat down to an extensive menu filled with rice, noodles, soups and curries and we both decided upon curry for the evening. I chose a yellow and my husband chose red. They were BOTH incredibly delicious.  The curries were a perfect mix of salty, spicy, sweet and sour and the texture of the curry was so smooth and velvety. My only complaint is upon asking for spicy we didn't find the dish spicy at all but some red chili flakes took care of that problem.  I had Thai Coffee and my husband had Thai Iced Tea, both of which were very good.  The women's restroom was not only clean but the decor was nice as well.  We will be downtown soon and we will be going to this restaurant! Highly recommended.

I am a big fan of Greek food and not only does the food taste pretty good but it's a great fun atmosphere as well. The portions are huge so it is no problem sharing but my only complaint AGAIN is the lack of *Greek* children food items. The portions are so large, though, that it isn't a big deal for my son to just share the food from my plate. But chicken fingers at a Greek restaurant????  I can't even remember all of the dishes we have had at this restaurant but they were all good. My husband always enjoys a gyro, their hummus is delicious and the feta fries...YUM.  I didn't feel out of turn bringing my sometimes loud-mouth son to the restaurant since it is pretty loud there already. So, keep that in mind.

My family and I shop at Fresh & Easy on a weekly basis. We never have to wait in long lines and the store is always clean and easily accessible.   Even stopping by for a sandwich and a bottled water while on the go doesn't take more than 3 or 4 minutes, which includes time to park your vehicle and walk inside the store.  I hope they build one in my neighborhood soon.

Cue Angels Singing.  FINALLY, a great Asian market on the West side of town that isn't in the ghetto, is decently close to my home and allows me to stock my pantry since I rarely cook American food. As soon as we saw the sign go up I was stalking that store like some sort of psycho.  The restaurant is now open and the drink counter offers Taro Smoothies with Boba - the most fantastic drink ever invented.  Lee Lee doesn't have it all but it is close. Their herb selection is incredible with bunches of lemon grass for $1 and a variety of mints, cilantro and parsley. Ranch Market over off of the 202 has a better vegetable selection but I figure that beggars can't be choosers. I'll take it.  Today alone I re-stocked my pantry with groceries that spanned the globe. Curry leaves and dhals for Indian dishes, Shrimp paste, curry pastes and green papaya for Thai foods and stocked up on standard Chinese ingredients such as light soy sauces and rice.  They also have a pretty decent sake selection. Bevmo charges outrageous prices for some of the same items.  In terms of fish smell - of course - they sell FISH. Fresh fish that they will remove the head, guts and clean the skin. No complaints here.

My husband and I ate lunch at Kabuki restaurant and while it served it's purpose the meal wasn't much above mediocre. We ordered the following:   Husband:   SAMURAI DELUXE - $10.95 Beef Teriyaki, Chicken Teriyaki, Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura   Me:   DYNAMITE ROLL - $4.25 (6 slices) Sauteed Vegetables, Crab   VOLCANO SUSHI #1 - $3.75 (2 slices) Baked spicy Tuna   VEGAS - $10.00 (not on menu) (6 slices)   SEAWEED SALAD - $4.95 Marinated Seaweed with Sesame oil and seed   MISO SOUP - $1.50   The sushi was just *ok*. The dynamite roll was the best in terms of flavor, the Vegas roll was tasty although Stingray's and Ra's is much better. I found the Volcano to be a little lacking in flavor and texture.   The seaweed salad was great, just like the kind I purchase at the Chinese market in the Cultural Center and priced comparatively.   The husband's tempura was sort of bland and the chicken and beef were fine. The green salad with miso and ginger dressing was very nice.   The decor is nice and the wait staff was attentive except towards the end when we were waiting for our check. Bathrooms were clean and orderly.   With food and drink and tax our check came to roughly $40. For lunch and considering the quality that was kind of pricey. There are other Japenese options on the west side of town that are much better.   If I were going for a work function and not footing the bill, I'd eat there. Otherwise there are too many other options at Westgate with the same view and better food.

The husband, toddler and I all went to Shane's for lunch yesterday at Westgate. We are fans of Honey Bears but thought we'd try this out since it close to our house.  I ordered the Smothered Pork Sandwich (coleslaw on the sandwich) with a side of baked beans, my husband ordered the pork sandwich on the texas toast with fries and my son had the cheeseburger.  First, let me mention that I hate it when the child menu doesn't offer the primary specialty of the place. My son ate half of my sandwich and not  a single bite of his burger. Perhaps my son is an odd-ball but he actually likes the same food we do. Next time I'll just order him a pulled-pork sandwich and call it a day.  The sandwiches were great and my son's burger was DELICIOUS. Their sauce is pretty good but I do prefer Honey Bear's sauce as I think it has a little complex flavor in comparison.  I think it will be a place we will use to pick up sandwiches on nights we don't want to cook - for sure.

Prior to eating at Grimaldi's Pizza in Peoria I was a fan of the Scottsdale location. I was very excited to learn that a location would be opening up near our home.  This is the best pizza that I've had in the Valley, hands down. We always order a large Pepperoni Pizza with the occasional purchase of a White Pizza. We've also ordered salads and and antipasto and have been pleased every time.  The crust is thin and a little chewy and the quality of the toppings come shining through.  No, the pizza isn't weighed down with tons of toppings, there are enough toppings for every part of the pizza to sing.
