We have driven by here so many times and finally stopped in. Got three burritos and two street tacos. Verdict...so good!!!  Meet was tender and juicy and the girls behind counter were helpful with all of our questions. The burritos the kids loved and every last drop! They have a fabulous creamy red salsa and there are just no words to describe how good it was!!

I was in desperate need of a cut as my hair has a pixie cut that should stay short. I found this salon and Holly. I was nervous as I have been going to the same place for almost 15 years, but sadly they were booked out. So I bit the bullet and tried a new location. Holly did a great job on my hair and it is super cute. The prices were very reasonable and the staff were uber friendly. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the salon it self was somewhat messy with chair taped together to hide holes and such. I am looking forward to future trims!!! Thanks.

Food was good, but service was terrible!!  Waited like 10 min before we were asked out drink orders. Another 15 went by before we got them. Asked for a beer...didn't get it all...asked again...still nothing. The owners or group of guys that looked and acted like owners were chat chitting and eating two booths down while we were waiting.  Large group came in 15 min after we did and got appetizers and drinks before we got water!!! Seriously!!! Food was good and filling, just sad the service was lacking.

First time here. Really like the open and fresh feel of the place!!! Yummy Bellini to be had!!!! Had eggs Benedict with jalape√±o English muffin and hubby had chicken fried steak. Super tasty!!!   Server was really knowledgeable about all the items on the me u and was able to give great recommendations base in my vague explanation if wants. I would totally recommend this place.

Wow...where to begin. Classic bar feel...but omg!!! The food is GREAT!!!! We order nachos for an appetizer...the ground beef was seasoned to perfection. Dinner was corned beef and cabbage...didn't know it also came with fresh veggies and another side!!! Lots of food. Corned beef was so tender and seasoned so well...not too salty!! Cabbage was a little salty but had some great seasoning going on. I got Mac and cheese as my side and its not your kids Mac and cheese!!! Gouda and noodles...nuff said!! Hubby got bacon burger and waffle fries...fries were SO good..crispy on outside and soft in middle. Hamburger...well fist off they brand the burgers...the patty is mixed with a little pork for added flavor...so good. Waitress was very knowledgable of all the beers...too many to comment on!!  Big TVs every where to see game... Needless to say, come check it out!

Wow...this place has really gone down. New menu and chef...very sad. Meat pie was burnt on top raw, on bottom, liquids in middle.  Very disappointed. We won't be back.

First time here. Pizza is super yummy.  Kind of reminds me of Chipotle in that you make your own pizza at the window and they cook it. Crust is light thin crust...yummy!!! Lots a ways to make a pizza...I had Italian meaty...very meaty!

Cute place!!! My husband and wanted a sweet treat and this was in our neighborhood. Lots of people enjoying themselves. I am not sure what I got...Sambores I think. Fresh mango ice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yummy!  Wes got a strawberry sundae...which was gone in 5 seconds!! Check it out for a place to beat the heat.
