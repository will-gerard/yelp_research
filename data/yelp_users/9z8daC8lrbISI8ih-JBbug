After signing up for their free text message deals of the week, I was left disappointed after sharing it with friends. The service was slow (under staffed) and their attitude was "they were doing us a favor"! Customer service needs to be the priority folks! Chandler will not support a restaurant establishment with such low standards. This town is too small to have BIG city attitude. Stay in Scottsdale.

Being a technician myself, I'm comfortable saying this salon has been my own go to place. Personally I think they take pride in their work while maintaining a friendly atmosphere without the "chatter" of private conversations over you (if you know what I mean) My guy prefers to have conversations with me as oppose to awkward silence & I enjoy our banter. Each time I'm there I usually run into neighbors or my daughters friends - so it's exciting to sit back and let him do his job, while I get to visit.  Besides wanting a clean towel at my appointment- I'm as happy as can be. Thanks for making time for me "J"!
