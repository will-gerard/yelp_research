I loved this store. I came here every week growing up and when I came back to visit Arizona after a year or so, my heart was broken. I believe Gracie's is closed now and they're building condos in the area.  EDIT: Gracie's has moved to the plaza over right next door to Food City. The old location is being built into low-income apartments with Gracie's future location on the first floor.

SO MUCH BETTER THAN PHO 68! I've been going to Pho 68 since it opened, but Pho Van blows it out of the water. Service was great, but slightly slower than what I'm used to. Decorations were beautiful, and most importantly - the food was delicious. I liked that the menu has kid sizes, that was super cute. The owner is very friendly and nice, I'll definitely be back when I'm in Arizona again.

I seriously thought that Montreal bagels were going to be some overhyped thing that only existed in people's minds. I could not have been so wrong.  Once upon a time, I thought there weren't too many differences in bagels. A bagel was a bagel, and as long as it had a little cream cheese (and not too much), it was fine.  And then I had a bagel from here. Scratch that, two bagels. I watched the employees work the dough into a circle, dip it in honey water, and throw it in the oven. I watched them artistically slather cream cheese on it (unfortunately I asked for only a little and ended up wiping a lot off) and deliver it to me in a little white paper bag.  I loved the thinness of the bagel and its vague sweetness. It's 100% superior to NYC bagels and I really just can't wait to come back to Montreal for its yummy food.  I suggest grabbing some bagels from here and eating it at the top of Mount Royal. Watch out for the raccoons.

Thank you to Maestro SVP for making a romantic weekend in Montreal a success!  I heard from a friend that if you want to eat out in Montreal, you have to make a reservation. However, with limited wifi and no cell phone service, that can definitely be a struggle. After checking on OpenTable and seeing no availability, we decided to give it a shot and hope for the best.  Though there were two tables with 'reserved' signs, Maestro gave one of them to us! I was so excited. The decor is intimate - dim lighting, oysters hung up on their Wall of Fame, simple white tablecloths. The servers were all very charming and friendly, and kept us served with fresh tap water and warm bread.  We got the two promotional oysters by checking in on Yelp and ordered two more (YUM. YUM YUM YUM.) and ordered the Maestro Platter (Hot Platter) for two.  Holy shit.   This platter was HUGE. It was so much food and it was beautifully arranged! Even now, days after, I can still remember which sauce goes with what.  The marmalade = coconut shrimp Gin and Cheyenne (white sauce) = calamari Peanut sauce (sweet and brown) = shrimp satay Garlic butter = shellfish Lemon butter(?) = shellfish  The platter includes half a lobster, crab legs, TONS OF MUSSELS, clams, coconut shrimp, and calamari.   I literally inhaled the mussels, they tasted so good with the two butters. I wasn't a big fan of the calamari - too salty for me - but my boyfriend loved it. Guess it all worked out!   We both thought the coconut shrimp was just okay. Too much breading and dried coconut flavor, not enough shrimp.   The crab and lobster were delicious and the meat came out super easily.   Hats off to Maestro, we'll definitely be back next time we're in town!

I waited in line at the takeout for about 15 minutes, not bad at all! Yes, it's $9 for a sandwich. Yes, you may have doubts because every tourist loves this place. Yes, it looks just like a regular sandwich that you can get in any deli.  BUT YOU'RE WRONG!  Schwartz's smoked meat is something I have never had before in my life. The meat was stacked so high, I couldn't figure out where the little halves of bread were supposed to go! The flavor was so good, I was licking the dripping juice off my wrist (I know, gross). The mustard went so well with this sandwich that I was drooling for the next one as I had just started my first half.   I tried to get another sandwich to go for my drive back to New York, but alas - they only open at 10:30.  I'll be back for you, Schwartz.

This is the second time I've been here and I have to say, I wish I lived here just so I could get routine cuts from Kai.  He is very skilled and trained as a stylist and barber so he really pays attention to the details. I came in two weeks after my last cut with a very overgrown pixie. Kai transformed it into a fresh, clean, badass cut.   He cut the damaged parts off and listened to what I wanted, but also offered feedback on what would look best on me. I really loved the service and quality at Beauty to Beauty.   10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND

I love this place. I needed to desperately change the haircut I had, and he was so perfect. He was fast, efficient, and knew exactly what to do. I showed him a few pictures since I don't speak Korean, and he really delivered. Very happy with the results, and the price was pretty affordable too! Thank you!

I'm Chinese, and I have traveled to Japan many times...this is some of the best ramen in America I have ever had! I had to move away, but while I was living there I was literally at Republic Ramen every single day. Their boba is fresh and flavorful, their edamame is perfectly prepared, and each of their ramen dishes is absolutely wonderful. My personal favorite was the miso ramen with naruto, pork, and the usual toppings with a black milk tea. Everyone who works there is super nice and chill, always friendly and courteous.   It just doesn't get better than this!

I asked for a long bob, emphasized that I did not want to cut my hair short. I said again and again that it seemed like he was cutting it too short, he just said "ok" and kept going.

I REALLY wanted to give them another shot. The woman in front was so nice and friendly, after the cut ended up too short I set up an appointment with Holly to just make it a pixie. I'm here now, and the salon isn't even open. It's MLK day and I specifically asked when I called if they would be open, and they gave me a resounding yes. So...miscommunication? I don't know?   Sigh.

Literally stumbled on this place while walking down the street checking out the Plateau at night. It's a small, humble black door on a big flashy street with just the words "BAR" in Kanji and English in gold in small letters.   Ended up only waiting about 5 minutes (we got there around 9pm on a Friday) and entered a mysterious dark hallway with a red carpet.   It feels like a magical secret club when you enter and are greeted by the rows and rows of candles. The wooden maze that takes up the entire room creates ample room for seating (well. as spacious as a speakeasy can be) with swiveling chairs that help create an intimate setting for two people.   If you come here with a group, don't expect to sit together. It's more likely you will find one empty seat and others will have to stand.  Drink wise, it was tasty! I don't drink so I had the diablo de menthe, which was refreshingly minty. A+ in my book. My boyfriend had some kind of sake cocktail and complained that it barely had any alcohol in it. Still, BIJ was a perfect way to wrap up an accidentally romantic evening.   I'm surprised that my first speakeasy (does this count as one?) experience was in Montreal instead of NYC, but delighted that we were able to get in with no wait.

LOVE IT! I always have shave ice when I'm in China, and it's great to see it finally land here in the Valley.   For those who don't know, many countries and cultures in Asia and across the world have shaved ice desserts. They may range from Filipino halo-halo, to Korean bingsu, and to Chinese bing-sha. Most of them involve finely shaved ice with sweetened condensed milk, fruits, beans, and other toppings.  Snoh takes it one step further by providing flavors of shaved ice! I loved their green tea and taro snoh, especially paired with toppings like mochi and red bean with a glaze of sweetened milk. Highly recommend this place.  The decor is bright and trendy with cool artists displaying their work on the walls. There are TVs on the walls and overall, it's a great place to socialize with friends and just chill.

Low quality, SLOW, and not worth it!   Blegh do not come here!   Came here for dinner with my family, I was looking forward to it because of everyone else's reviews. The tuna sashimi was old, had stringy parts, and was mushy. Couldn't stomach it at all. The salmon was a little better but all of the sashimi was cut way too thick and big which reduced the quality.   The lovers roll was forgettable. Not worth the $12.   Finally, we were still hungry so we ordered a ramen soup and an udon noodle soup. We waited almost 35 minutes for it before being told that they were still going to take 5 minutes. It's unbelievable how slow this place is, the sushi took a long time too.   I wish I could get our money back, what a wasted meal. PLEASE don't come here,

This place literally saved our lives!   I've never dealt with such fantastic customer service with people who really went out of their way to help a customer. Long story short, we were stuck with a rental car from hell that needed an oil change, new brake pads, and new rotors. (P.S. Never rent from Action Car Rental in NYC)   Steve S. at Firestone solved our problems quickly and made sure to make us feel safe and cared about. Although the rental company agreed to reimburse us, he helped keep the costs low. Turns out all four brake pads were essentially gone, and grinding metal on metal.   Thank you Firestone for being so fast with the repairs, so friendly, and so honest. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who has any kind of car trouble!

I haven't been out and about in Phoenix in almost 5 years and Valley Bar completely caught me off guard! I never would have expected such a cool spot to exist here. I'm a sucker for speakeasies and hidden bars, and Valley Bar hit every mark I was looking for.  The ambiance was quiet, intimate, but super chill. Everyone was there to have a good time, meet friends, and enjoy the secret basement. No one got super drunk or messy, and it was a really nice night. The drinks were affordable and tasty (according to my friends since I don't drink) but the doughnuts REALLY won me over. I ordered the orange-something and the maple bacon. The maple bacon was literally inhaled by my friend and I, and the orange one a close second.  I also got the fried pickles and my friend got the classic dog. Unique, affordable, foodie eats in a secret location? It doesn't get better than this!  I'll be back before I leave to check out the music section.  I love you, Valley Bar!
