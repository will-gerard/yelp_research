There are very few places where my girlfriend and I can agree to eat. We have completely opposite tastes in food, so going to dinner usually leaves one of us feeling a bit unsatisfied.   We've agreed on Nandos three times in the past two weeks.   The food is always excellent. As soon as you sit down you are given chips and salsa that are entirely too easy to fill up on. Both the fajitas and the quesadilla had a very generous portion of steak, easily the biggest I have ever had at comparable places. As a diabetic, I almost never eat sweets, but the fried ice cream is just too much to resist. It is so good that I happily sacrifice a day's worth of insulin to eat it.   The service is outstanding, and the atmosphere is bright and friendly.

I went here last night with my girlfriend.  The Staff:  The woman at the counter was clearly put off by the fact we chose to eat at their establishment. We came in without a "hello", or a "welcome", she walked up the counter and stood there staring at us silently, waiting for us to order. We had to look at the menu first, which took about 90 seconds, she was visibly annoyed. She took our order and money without a word, or even a smile. On the way out the door I even said "thanks much", and still she remained silent, instead looking up briefly with what I can only call contempt, as if she was doing me some favor.   The Food:  I had the spaghetti and meatballs. The only way to describe it was sub-par. There was almost no sauce, and the meatballs tasted like they had been soaking in a Sun City hot tub since the time of biblical creation. The bread was burned, and not just a little, it was black on 3 of 4 sides.   The GF had the veggie pizza, and she said it was good. I didn't try it.   Conclusion:  I won't be giving my money to them again. Reading through the other reviews, I have to agree with Joseph S. You can get better food for less money from people who are happy to have your business.   In all, the experience was so bad that it prompted me to write my first Yelp review, but I don't know, maybe I'm just a jerk!

I absolutely love Tott's. On average I eat there once a week and I have yet to have a bad experience. The food is great, the building is clean and inviting, and the staff is very friendly.  What is more, Tott's offer student and military discounts; they even employ a ginger! Humanitarianism like that really plucks my liberal heartstrings?  Judging by the crowd that always seems to be there, and indeed, the reviews here; it appears I'm not the only southern Tempe local to have discovered this gem. If you find yourself craving Asian food in Tempe, you would be wise to skip the Pei Wei located in the same lot, and try Tott's.   Besides, everyone knows Pei Wei is a relationship killer.
