Saw Dr Kristina Jay yesterday. I had 2 ingrown toenails. They hurt. She treated one. The next one U.S. In 2 weeks. She said I would need a week to heel. Well one day and all good. She did a wonderful skillful job on my toes. Couldn't be happier. No more pain.

We have always gone to Mastro's  for special and not so special days.  Alway enjoyed our dining experience.  We were there for my Wife's 60th birthday on April 26th.  As usual the food was great. What was not was the service.  I brought a party of 12 people. So needless to say it was an expensive evening. In the past we would have 2 sometimes three servers attending to our needs. This time barely one. It really made for an unpleasant evening.  Masto's if you are trying to cut staff to save $$$. It will kill your reputation.

I am at the BAR many an evening.  Staff is great.  Menu is always changing and interesting. Organic local food. It is great to have a neighborhood "bar" you can relax and shoot the breeze at. North Scottsdale had been sorely missing a place like Calistros.  .

Calistro's One of my favorite restaurants. Being local I am here often. Their happy hour rocks..Bar menu 50% off regular menu.   Try the Lamb Meatloaf. Excellent.  Make sure you try The Sassy Stinger....a drink for 2.

Summer Concert Series***Very Poorly Executed** We bought good seats to see ZZ Top. I have seen then in concert before.   The chairs were so close together you couldn't even move you legs. The sound was awful. So the state of the art sound system they say, Not existent. I really felt taken, gypped. The concert was less than an hour. Yes I get it they are old, should have had an opening band. I'm not blaming ZZ top, I don't think Talking Stick has the expertise to put on these concerts. They need professional help.

I just had 2 windshields replaced by Safepro. First time using them.   1) Honda CR-V. Fast and friendly service.  2) Audi A7. They put the wrong window in. The day/ night sensor wouldn't work after replacement. I called a few days after the install, told them the problem. They said they will get back with me. A few hours later I received a call back. Indeed the wrong windshield was installed. They came out removed the wrong one and put in the right all us great now. My point is, errors happen. Audi has several windshields for the same car with very minor differences. I ordered my car from Germany so the info is not translating through by vin number. Thank you Safepro for a great job.  You have my future business.

My family and I went to brunch there on Sunday late morning. The place was pretty empty except for the bar that was full. Nice enough place. Been here for late night but never for Brunch. Well the food took almost 40 minutes to come out. The bacon was mooing. It was disgusting. I almost had to tackle the waiter to get his attention. Very very expensive for a I don't really care attitude by all who work there.

I live very close to DC Ranch. I invited friends from downtown Phoenix to join us at a new restaurant in DC Ranch. I made a reservation on OPEN Table, easy enough.  We all got there about 1/2 hour early, we had no problem sitting at the bar. We wanted to sit outside, but there was no available. Again OK.  We ordered Apps. Cheese plate fantastic, Mussels excellent, Crab cakes soso,    Dinner was mixed.  I had this, very tasty:  'Red Bird' Rotisserie Chicken  Tamale Pie    16   My Wife enjoyed this very much:  Alaskan Halibut  Corn Flake Gremolata,  Candied Tomato-Jalapeno Salsa    25   Two people had hamburgers Inedible So well done Problem: waiter never came over once to see if everything was alright.   That is not acceptable.   Enough said
