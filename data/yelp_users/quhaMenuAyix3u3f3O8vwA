We will never go there again. We waited for an hour once we sat and our order was taken we waited again. When the server brought our breakfast my eggs were cold, the tortillas were cold and my husband meal eggs with chorizo had not taste. As we were leaving we asked to speak to the manager and asked if the had a card to give my review and he said to go to yelp and write. He asked was there an issue and I told what my concerns were and all he said "OKAY". I expected to hear I'm sorry to hear that please give us another try but now. I do not want to spend my time or money here!! It is also overpriced!!!

We were very happy when Singing Panda opened up. The food was very good. We have returned various times but after awhile the service was not good. The owner does not even talk to the customers only too a few not like at the beginning. My favorite appetizer calamari is not as good as before. Not happy!
