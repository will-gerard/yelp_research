Camelback Volkswagen came to my rescue last Friday and I couldn't be more grateful.  On Friday, March 8th 2013, I went to leave for work in the morning and unfortunately came out to a flat tire. Seeing as it was raining and I just don't trust myself changing my own tire, (let's be honest), I called AAA to come take care of it for me. The man who arrived began to take off the tire but found out that my car needed a particular piece to remove this one special lug nus that was on it. And sadly, he didn't have this piece, so we set off to the closest VW dealership which was Camelback.  We get there to purchase this piece but they apparently make all different types and a master set would cost at least $70. I hated that I now needed to dish out all this money for one tiny little piece to change a flat tire for a service my insurance covers. Well,  Don was standing at the counter and said that he had a master set we could borrow if we promised to return it. Mind you, Don had no idea who we were and still lent a helping hand to a girl in need. I traded my license as collateral and we were off to fix my flat!  When all was said and done, I promptly returned to Camelback VW to return Don's tools (and retrieve my license). Don wasn't there but George was at the counter and remembered us. He asked me how everything went and I explained to him that we were never going to use those special lug nuts again and simply switch to the standard ones. Well, he goes to the back and gives me the one I was missing, completely free. I know it's maybe a $5-6 dollar piece, but it was still a huge gesture. This kind of business will absolutely make me return.  Don and George's hospitality deserve this review and I couldn't be more appreciative of their help. Thanks to you both and to Camelback VW! Absolutely recommend!

I went here a few times just because it was conveniently close to my house. My nails turned out okay, but the last time I went was the last time I'll ever walk into this place. After 2-3 weeks, I needed an acrylic fill, and 2-3 weeks is the normal amount of time to come back, as everyone knows. For whatever reason, they decided (without telling me it was going to happen) that all my nails needed to be removed, so the lady took one acrylic nail, shoved it underneath my acrylic nails and ripped them off one by one. It was horrible. And if that isn't horrifying enough, they charged me $10 on top of my fill for the nail removal! Seriously? My nails were sore after that and I knew I wouldn't be going back.  I'd recommend you just skip this place. I may pay a few bucks more now, but it's worth the service I get at my new salon. And they'd never rip my nails off like that. Ever.

Oh Miracle Mile.. This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix. Super awesome deli and everyone who works there is so nice. I order something a little strange and off-menu because I'm a vegetarian, and they are always so accommodating. My boyfriend usually gets the pastrami and loves it every time. The mac and cheese is delicious and just like a deli should, you always get a free pickle!  They are moving to their new location in June which will be less then a block away from where I live, so I'm concerned that I'll be there every day. We'll see what happens. Looks like it's gonna be a cool spot though!  Stay awesome!

We've been taking our dog, Carli, to Camelback Animal Hospital since we got her 2.5 years ago and we absolutely love Dr. Cruz and his team. A couple months ago around 7:00pm on a Friday night, we noticed Carli was having some breathing issues and needed to bring her to a vet right away. We knew the office would be closed but took our chances and called anyway. Luckily, Dr. Cruz was still there and answered our call. We explained what was happening and even though the office was closed and he was the only one there, he still let is bring Carli over so he could take a look at her. That is exceptional customer service. We have been so happy with them for the last few years and will always bring out pets here! Carli loves everyone there - and she's doing just fine, too!

This place was such a good find! It was my turn to choose something for date night and I was looking for an open mic night somewhere and landed on this place. We didn't take part in the open mic night, but it was still fun to watch!  They have a lot of really great beer options available, and the best part about this place is their token system. They have a $15 minimum if you're paying with a card and if you don't reach that, you can pay for a few extra drinks and you'll get some tokens that you can bring back and use for your drinks next time. Totally awesome. Their menu looks really good and unique too!  They also have a lot of games - darts, video golf, and tons of board games. This place is definitely a hole in the wall. It's kind of behind the Baskin Robbins, to the left of the party store. Also, the staff is really awesome. We came back for open mic night a week later and they remembered us and our drink orders!  Definitely check this one out if you're in the area. Oh and the open mic night is on Tuesdays in case you were wondering!

My boyfriend and I just discovered this place not too long ago and it turned out to be a wonderful experience. I was craving some chocolate cream pie and this place popped up in my search with some positive reviews so we decided to check it out, and I couldn't have been more pleased. It was the absolute perfect chocolate cream pie and I honestly don't think there's a lot out there who can compete. The crust was flaky and buttery and perfectly complimented the chocolate cream filling. Might I add that the sliced are a generous QUARTER of the entire pie. So there's that too.  So we definitely found our new spot for pie and playing cards. This place has such a 'homey' feel and you can tell it's been around for a long time - in a good way!

All these negative reviews on here are absolutely right. I would have picked 0 stars if I could. Let's just dive right into this, shall we?  -I'm moving out in a month. If it weren't for me getting my mail one day and mentioning that I was leaving, I would have never known to sign their 30-day notice before leaving, otherwise they'd charge me the month-to-month price which was ENORMOUS.    -My ceiling was POURING water constantly where the air filter is. I had to switch out bowls and pots around the clock because they were filling so fast. I even had to leave work to pour out all the water. Oh, and I put in TONS of work requests to get it fixed. If you want anything fixed around there, call the emergency line - twice. I submitted 3 online work requests, called twice, and finally after about 3 weeks, they came and 'fixed' the problem. I say 'fixed' because about 3-4 days ago, it started leaking again. It's unreasonable that they couldn't fix the problem the first time, or even when I asked to have it fixed in the first place.  -Bugs. When I first moved in, there were ants. Now there are fruit flies. And I just cannot get rid of them. No matter how much I clean, these bugs just won't go anywhere. Maybe this has something to do with the fact that I never got a screen door AND the lock to my back door was busted before I moved in, so bugs found an easy way in. Neither of which were fixed/replaced, by the way. Thank goodness I live on the second floor, otherwise I'd feel even more unsafe...  -It's loud. You can hear EVERYTHING that's happening outside. Dogs barking, kids screaming.. even people just walking around. If you want peace and quiet, this is not the place to go.  -There is a gate at the entrance, but I'm pretty sure that thing NEVER closes anymore. How safe is that? What's the point of having a gated entry if the gate doesn't work. I'll come back around 9 or 10 at night and it's still wide open. When I first moved in, it'd be closed around 7 or so. I should also mention that my code to the gate has never worked. If the gate does happen to be closed (which is a rarity these days), if I don't have my clicker, I'm locked out until another car happens to come by.   -When I first moved in, one of their maintenance trucks would constantly park in my designated parking spot, forcing me to illegal park somewhere else. If you have assigned parking, you know exactly how frustrating this is.   -It's expensive. It's not worth paying that amount to live there. Maybe if the security worked and they fixed things in a timely matter, it would be worth it, but it just isn't. You can find better cheaper places anywhere.   Take my advice: use this place as a last resort. It's honestly not worth the stress and your money could be much better spent. Once you sign your lease, they forget you exist because they only care about getting paid. I'm glad I signed the shortest lease I could and I'll be so happy when it's finally up and I can move out next month.  Good luck in your apartment search.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Update:  Just received a call TODAY saying I owed $125 for cleaning and move out fees from Scottsdale Springs. Total garbage. I paid everything in full when I moved out in NOVEMBER.  I know the move out fees were paid because I physically went down into the office, they gave me my total balance, and I paid it all right there. And my apartment was spotless when I moved out. A piece of advice - leave your place a mess when you move out because they will charge you this cleaning fee regardless. So why not at least make it with your money and put them to work.  This place is the worst. Do not move here. Don't waste your money. You'll seriously regret it and wish you lived in a box on the side of the road. You'd get more for your money that way and the box probably won't report you to debt collectors when they 'forget' to send you a bill. I promise you that much.

This place is always incredibly busy, but that's nothing to take stars away for. I come here a lot late at night to get work done and never have a bad time - especially when you can get unlimited coffee for $2. If you're here for breakfast, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to not get their sweet dutch pancake. Holy Moley that thing is worth wrecking diets over. Their homemade whipped cream is to die for.   Anyway, check this spot out. Great location right on Central, cool vibe, great food and drinks, and everyone who works there is nice. Never a bad time at Lux.

I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I was there this past Saturday. We waited for over an hour to get into this place and it was not even close to being worth it. It was packed and crowded and completely disorganized. Not to mention we were in the Guest List line. Awful.   Anyway, thank goodness we got in for free. Cover would have been $30 bucks and I would have hated myself for paying it and having a terrible time inside. I did manage to pay $16 dollars for a watered down Vodka Red Bull. Thanks. The music wasn't good either. I recognized maybe one song. The rest was a terrible concoction of whatever the DJ was making up. When we did make our way to the dance floor, it was chaos. And NOT the good kind. There were way too many people trying to fit into too small a space making it simply impossible to dance, let alone move. We were out of there within 20 minutes tops.   I rarely take the time to write reviews. So seriously, don't waste your time at this establishment. With all the other clubs to choose from, use this as a last resort.  Terrible.

Definitely the best Chinese food around. I'm a vegetarian and they special-made me everything using vegetarian ingredients. If you're ordering vegetables, be sure to ask that it's not made with chicken stock. So happy to find a Chinese restaurant willing to accommodate my diet. Really appreciate it!

This place is phenomenal. It's tucked away so be sure not to miss it as you drive by! Their patio is beautiful at night and they sometimes have live music. Anyway, their food is absolutely amazing. I am a vegetarian and they have an incredible off-menu item; veggie enchiladas. A little spicy but perfectly delicious.   We've been there a few times and have always had a great experience. Service has always been wonderful. Nothing to complain about. Definitely try this place. I'll certainly be back.  A note to vegetarians, their cornbread has bacon in it. But if you're not vegetarian, it sounds like it would be a mistake not to order it. Everyone raves about it!

I had a great experience recently at the Carmax in Gilbert. It's quite far from where I live in downtown Phoenix, but it ended up being worth it both times we drove down there.  The first time I went in was Saturday 4/6. A few days before I had inquired about a Mini Cooper that I found doing a car search online. Keith was quick to respond to me and I made it out there as soon as I could. When we showed up on Saturday, Keith was busy with a customer so Denise took care of us instead, and she was absolutely wonderful. I was able to test drive the Mini Cooper I wanted and test drove another one just to confirm I liked the original (which I did). After that, my trade-in was appraised and it ended up being lower than I had hoped, but there were a lot of factors taken into account. So later on, I got approved for a loan very quickly and just needed to go home to get some documents.   I returned on Monday 4/8 to finalize everything. Keith was available to help us that time and he was very professional and really knew what he was talking about. It took a few hours to get everything done, but that's just how this works. As a first-time buyer, it was absolutely amazing to drive away in my new Mini Cooper. It's the perfect car for me and I find any excuse I can to drive it now.  My suggestion is this: do your research. I work in an industry where I'm very familiar with car dealerships and how they work, and at Carmax I never once felt like I was being pushed into a sale or being scammed into buying something I didn't need. It was an independent decision, and it was exactly how I'd like every car-buying experience to be in the future. I will without a doubt recommend Carmax to anyone looking for a car. Thank you again Keith and Denise for making my Mini Cooper happen! It had been a long search!

This place is the absolute best. It's got such a great ambiance and it's a fun, homey little place to eat at. If you don't know where it is, it's easy to miss, but I'm sure that's part of its charm. I never deviate from the veggie quesadillas because they are the absolute best quesadillas I have ever had. I'm sure you can't go wrong with choosing anything on the menu. They have all-day happy hour on Saturdays which you just can't beat. The staff is really nice and will remember you if you go there enough! It's got a great vibe and I will always recommend it. I'll definitely be heading back soon!

I'm convinced this place has THE best margaritas in Phoenix. I came here with some coworkers for happy hour once and discovered their amazing grapefruit margaritas. Then a few weeks later I went back for dinner and got their veggie quesadilla which was insanely good. Actually, it got really busy while we were there and our orders got misplaced so we waited about 30 minutes to get our food. We weren't in any sort of rush, so it was fine, but the server actually comped our meals which was unexpected, but totally awesome.  Be warned this place is TINY so if you've got a big group, prepare to wait. But trust me it's worth it. They also have a salsa bar in the back - my favorite was the pecan. Amazing.

I'm very pleased with my recent experience here. A few weeks ago I came to the optometrist they share a building with for my eye exam, and decided to pick out some glasses. I ended up being there for nearly two hours (including eye exam time) trying to find the right glasses and completely lost track of time. I didn't realize, but the store had actually closed by the time I found the right frames! They didn't make me feel rushed or pressured to choose frames so they could leave - it felt more like they wanted me to be happy with my choice. So finally when I did find the right ones, I asked if she could just make a note so I could come back in the morning to finish paying, etc, and instead, she said it was no problem to stay open for a few more minutes to allow me to finish checking out. Incredible customer service. There were two people closing up that night, unfortunately I don't remember their names, but they were totally understanding of my indecisiveness and were so willing to give me that little bit of extra time inside the store.  I came back the next day a little bit earlier than they suggested because I had to be somewhere else, and they were already finished with them! The woman working helped make sure my new glasses fit right and made a little alteration to them to make them perfect. Now I'm very satisfied with my new Ray Bans and I'll be back in a year or so when it's time for new Frames!

I came in a few weeks ago after booking an appointment online. It was super easy to make the appointment and they sent me plenty of reminders which was awesome! When I got there, everyone was really nice and helpful! Eyes tend to gross me out so I was nervous about how the appointment would go down, but Michelle definitely helped me throughout the whole thing! She was fantastic! I especially LOVE that they do not do that puff of air in the eyes! SUCH a relief because that's honestly the worst part about going to the eye doctor. Dr. Babu was awesome too! I've been to plenty of eye doctors but they are by far the best place I've been to! I can't wait to go back to pick up my new glasses next week! I'll be back to get sunglasses at some point too! You guys rock! Thank you!

Came here a few days ago and was really impressed. They press tortillas when you order them, making them taste extremely fresh and delicious. I like this place better than Chipotle. If you don't get their queso, you're making a huge mistake. Best queso around.

Absolutely love this place. It's so cute on the inside and run by this super nice brother and sister duo. And their food is out of this world. We usually go for breakfast and I get the french toast. It's probably the best french toast I've ever had, so if you're a french toast connoisseur, do yourself a favor and head over to this place.   They also have really good coffee. They recently got a new coffee machine and that thing is wondrous. They have tons of little pastries and such that are so hard to pass up when it's time to leave, so yes, you should help yourself to a cookie or an oatmeal cream pie. There's also a cute little patio in the back with a garden.  This is a wonderful little spot in Phoenix that you should definitely take time to visit. My only complaint is that they aren't open on Sundays! Crossing my fingers that that changes in the future!

Stopped in after checking this place out online and saw they had a lot of vegetarian options. When I got there I was totally overwhelmed with all the options so I just went to the counter, told them what I was looking for, and the found the exact sandwich I wanted. It happened to be on a menu from one of their other locations, but they are able to make just about anything you could want. As a vegetarian, it's difficult to find any place that's overwhelming with veggie options, so this was honestly a breath of fresh air. I initially thought it was a little bit pricey, but once I got the sandwich and saw just how big it was, the price definitely seemed fair. So my only advice would be to only go when you're really hungry, 'cause you're about to get more food than you can handle.  I'll be back next time I'm around Mill!

This place is truly authentic. It's a brand new little restaurant downtown and the perfect lunch spot if you work/live in the area. I ordered the Margherita pizza which was cooked to perfection. The basil was fresh and the sauce was sweet and perfect, holy moley. We also enjoyed some wine and obviously had to have some tiramisu and now I've been craving tiramisu basically every day since.  Everything about this place is fantastic. The pizza was a great size (I had plenty to take home and enjoy later). You can choose between their red and white wine, and we tried both and they were excellent. Tirimasu was to die for. And the owner/employees (who are all Italian) were all so friendly and made it a point to greet everyone who walked through the door. They've created a wonderful little Italian atmosphere in downtown Phoenix and I can't wait to go back. I want to try one of their delicious-looking paninis if I can stop myself from ordering a pizza first!

Super underwhelmed with this place. Came here a few months ago and didn't have the greatest experience as our order was incorrect and the food was just okay. But alas we decided to give it another try because I had a hankering for cheese fries. We ordered, sat outside, and waited for our buzzer to go off. Once it did, we went to the counter and not only was our order wrong again, but they were out of the cheese fry cheese. They were so kind though as to substitute their regular cheese with what looked like mayo and was quite possibly some white cheddar slices melted in the microwave. Super off-putting, especially when we only came for these dang cheese fries. We should have been reimbursed, but they didn't even say anything. Just handed us this weird cheese concoction without batting an eye.   Obviously, I'm quite passionate about cheese fries, but also passionate about businesses making a good impression. As far as I'm concerned, New York can take Shake Shack back.
