I have ordered Red Devil's pizza and wings for takeout for years now, but today was the first time I dined in the restaurant.  We started with the potato skins which were served slightly overcooked and without any sour cream, which Red Devil does not carry.  (Really? Who serves potato skins without sour cream).  For our entrees, I ordered the baked lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the double bacon cheeseburger.  I only took about two bites of my lasagna which was so overloaded with flavorless marinara that I could not bare another, and my boyfriend only ate about half of his double cheeseburger that looked comparable to a McDonald's burger and tasted like a "slightly better quality school lunch burger".  These three items and one Pepsi cost us 32 dollars before tip.  All in all, we left hungry and forty dollars poorer.    We will not be back for anything but the occasional pizza and wings.

I love Da Vang! I always order the lemon grass chicken, but have found myself forced to veer from it when they run out of it.  From what I can tell, the meat is low quality (hence the great low prices), but still prepared to be totally tasty!  Service is not especially speedy or friendly, but given the atmosphere, that is to be expected.

Chen & Wok on 7th street is the best!  Not only are the prices super low ($3-$4 ) the portions are huge! My boyfriend and I have been going there forever, and have never once had a bad experience.  The owners are wonderful, and the food is delicious. The only issue I have ever experienced is order accuracy with deliveries, I think there is a slight language barrier that makes phone in orders difficult.  However, they are quick to hurry back with the correct order.  All in all, Chen & Wok is a great deal for amazing food!
