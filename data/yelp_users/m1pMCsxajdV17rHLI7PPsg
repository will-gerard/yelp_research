Okay, so they sell out of class packets, fine. But then they send an email informing you that the packet you ordered is ready and to pick it up at the express will call station which is reportedly open Saturdays. It is not. Super unhelpful, especially when you can't even leave a message and are instead faced with an unending loop of ringing followed by a request to leave a detailed message which is followed not by a beep but another round of ringing followed by the same message....ridiculous.

Had lunch today at D'lish with my boyfriend. We ordered the tuna sandwich and the early bird burger (which is not a burger, but a patty made with quinoa) and went halfsies on them, which is easy to do because they come cut in half already. To drink I got the kombucha, which I believe is GTs Original, and my boyfriend got the lemonade. Overall, our experience was excellent. The tuna sandwich was fresh and well flavored. The early bird was also good, but for me it was a little bit too spicy (and I love spicy), though my boyfriend who loves-loves spicy thought it was excellent. The ingredients tasted fresh and the food was reasonably priced for the quality and portions. The service was excellent and the staff very helpful. Our food came out quickly and so we were able to enjoy a healthy, delicious lunch in less than 30 minutes.

A jewel. Truly. Trisha is an amazing massage therapist. I have been going to her for therapeutic massages for over a year now and I have been continuously impressed by the quality of my experience. Her understanding of the body and her evident skill at massage is coupled with a professional and yet friendly demeanor that puts you immediately at ease.

I adore Wedge and Bottle. I'll start with the #3 cheese sandwich because I have eaten it a lot. A lot, a lot. Why? Probably because I love horseradish and cheese and together they are magical. If you're feeling particularly hungry, get it along with the tomato soup for a gourmet comfort food combination. Other reasons to love Wedge and Bottle include, but are not limited to: the ever-changing selection of quality wines and cheeses and the knowledge of Krista and Troy to help you choose among them; the selection of craft beers and ciders; the grocery where you can get small batch chocolates, quality crackers, spreads, salts, honey and so much more; the wine and cheese of the month club, which I have had the good fortune to take part in 6 months running and have not once been disappointed in; the frequent and affordable wine tastings....I could go on like that for quite a while. There is always something new next to our favorites and we are always welcomed with a smile.   Go here often. You won't regret it.

I've been to NCounter a couple of times now, and i am pleased to say I rather like it. The first time I ordered the pear omelet, which I remember scarfing down in a state of sweet, cheesy, eggy bliss. I also had a greyhound - fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and vodka - which really made my day for two reason: first, it combines three of my favorite things (grapefruit, vodka, greyhounds), and also because the juice is fresh.   My second time there I got the Farmer's Market, which is there vegetarian version of eggs Benedict: English muffin, tomato, spinach, avocado, poached egg, hollandaise. Yum. Most of the dishes are paired with potatoes, and I am happy to report that these are also excellent. Many of the breakfast potatoes around are mediocre at best, but there are nicely seasoned and cooked just right. I paired my meal with a cappuccino, the only disappointing part of my experience. If you want a cappuccino made the traditional way, with equal parts espresso, steamed milk and foam, then order it dry. Otherwise you will be served a latte. Send it back and you will be served another latte. Say something to the barista and you will be informed that you are wrong. Ah well, this really isn't such a big deal since there is a clear way around it.   NCounter will likely be making it into the regular rotation of breakfast places, especially on days when a breakfast cocktail is in order.

I can't speak for the lobster entrees since they were sold out, but the lobster bisque is over salted, fishy and over priced. $9 for a cup (8 oz) of mediocre soup. The fried haddock was served on a doughy 10 cent bun slathered in mayo. Not worth $12.

Bangkok Bloody Mary. Do it. They are delicious.   After trying and failing to get into Snooze on a weekend, we finally made it on a Tuesday morning. There was still a little bit of a wait, but we managed to swing a couple seats at the bar where we stayed to eat. They generally seat the bar as part of the list, but it being a Tuesday and the wait not being very long, the bartender put in a good word and got us some menus. So here is my first bit of advice: if you want to go here on a weekend, make the time for it. Don't arrive starving. The place is regularly packed and on a wait and the food does not come out quickly. Take your time and enjoy.   I read a lot of great things about the pancakes at Snooze, but when it comes down to it, I am more a savory breakfast type of girl. I went with the eggs Benedict. I could not decide between the Chilaquiles Benedict and the Havana Benny, and so it was a very good thing that they do half orders! The Havana Benny ended up being my favorite; I found the chilaquiles a little bit under spiced for my taste. The hash browns were delicious, though I think the best thing about them was the presentation.   Overall, the experience was excellent and the bartender went above and beyond to make sure we got the right drinks and the right food.

Went here for brunch on Sunday with my mom. She ordered the open faced egg sandwich and I got the Veg and egg hash. Her sandwich was wonderful. Mine was eventually wonderful, but came out the first time with undercooked eggs (I like runny yolks, but not raw egg whites). I took it back and they just slapped the eggs back on the grill and overcooked them. Finally they got them right and the people behind the counter were very apologetic and cool about it. I really hate taking food back, especially twice, because I feel like I'm being a pain in the butt. On the other hand, I think it's important to give the restaurant a chance before giving a bad review or not returning. All in all it was a great experience - the coffee was good, the food was delicious and fresh, and everyone was friendly. Plus, they have a dog friendly patio for all of you dog owners out there.
