5 stars cause the atmosphere is great. My boyfriend and I stop in a quite a bit and have gotten to know a few servers in the short time we've been going in. It's so different from the ASU night life we all see on Mill Ave. and that's why I keep coming back. Plus, it's a minute bike ride from my house! You can lock your bike up outside or bring it inside and hang it on a bike bar. Patio is dog friendly. The food is good too. I've tried quite a few things on the menu... Pizza is delicious.. pulled pork was decent.. calzones are great... Burgers are great... The guacamole is delicious too!! Beer prices can be a little high but it's a good trade off for the experience I have everytime I go in. And their music is always catching my ear! Def. planning on being a regular.

Hector has been a tremendous help and has provided great customer service. I shopped for a good interlock company and I found one. They've always answered my questions and have been available for assistance when needed. Definitely recommend these guys.

Two stars cause the food is good. I have been here on a few occasions and the food is delicious but the service freaking sucks. The guy behind the bar was really rude. I asked if there was a smoothie for ashley, he sarcastically responded with "I dont know, IS there a smoothie for Ashley?" This is your job. You get paid to smile, be nice, and take food orders. I work at a very busy and local breakfast spot here in Tempe also so I get it. You guys are slammed. Believe me, I know the feeling.. but at least act like you care. The pretentious attitude from the young girl at the counter was enough for me to never return. I gave her a twenty and she didn't bother to give me my change. I had to ask for it... after I already put money in the tip jar. Are you kidding me? Take that shit to Scottsdale.

Bird and his staff are great. I've referred a few people straight to e cig city. The prices are awesome, they have a good selection, and the staff knows what they're doing. The atmosphere is also great. I always feel welcomed and comfortable when I go in there. Not one bad thing to say about the shop! Check out the new Tempe location!!!
