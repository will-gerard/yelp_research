The food was AMAZING! We tried so many different kinds of Sushi from The Tootsie Roll to spicy tuna rolls and they are all delicious! The frozen oranges were the perfect after dinner treat!  The song and show for the next tables Bday was a hoot and our waitress was extremely attentive and on top of her game.  It is a small place but didn't feel uncomfortably crowded even though all tables were full.

My husband surprised me for Valentines Day and we went for dinner. The atmosphere is refreshing and engaging.  The live band was fantastic as was our waitress and all her little helpers.  Then the food came.... WOW! SO delicious! We loved everything we tried from the pupu's and tidbits to the amazing entree and the mouth watering red velvet cake for dessert.  A nice adult place for dinner where we were still able feel comfortable in jeans and enjoy delicious food and great music.

We went to the Science Center for their body exhibit and then walked around to find something to eat. We chose The Rose and Crown because it was close, not too fancy and the music pouring out was great. We ate out on the beautiful porch of this amazing house and although we don't drink, we were welcomed and enjoyed the experience. I asked the waiter for his dinner suggestion and went with it (fish and chips), my husband ordered the shepherds pie. Both were quite delicious. I even took the time to use the restroom and to see the inside of the restaurant and enjoyed the ambiance throughout the pub.  I will definitely be back with friends to enjoy again.

I would give the food a 4 the price a 3 and the service a 1.  Not sure if I would go back but I can't say the food wasn't good.   Probably wouldn't be too bad if I had a couple hours to kill watching how NOT to treat customers.

We were trying to choose a new place for lunch at work and this was mentioned. We all LOVED it! (that is saying a lot!) We ordered off the online menu and I called it in (she was VERY friendly) it was ready in less than 10min and was hot and delicious!!! It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg and is close enough to go there fairly often. We will be back!

This place was amazing from beginning to end. Loved the name and thought we would check it out, Had no idea it was a get seated and sit down restaurant. Waiter was completely fabulous and very attentive.  The food was SOOO delicious!!! The drinks come in a large quart jar with many to choose from.  Husband had catfish (said it came with 2 pieces but it actually was 4), smothered potatoes, cornbread and mac n cheese.' I had smothered chicken breast with waffle and cheesy grits on the side,  The smothered part (gravy and grilled onions) was amazing. The chicken was huge, the grits were mouth watering and the waffle was perfect.  We left with a HUGE box of leftovers after stuffing ourselves and couldn't even order their famous red velvet cake. We'll have to leave room for it next time.

Although the artwork is amazing and the place looks modern and sleek, the service and care is not so great.  If a great look was all that was important in healthcare, they would win hands down but when sick or injured or worse...dying. These are not the things that matter to me.  When your loved one is hooked up to many many different wires, needles, bags, machines, etc. and the alarms are going off, it would be nice to actually have someone act like it matters.  Its important to know that your loved one is being cared for as if they were the caregivers own family member.  I actually never met or spoke to a Dr. but I did visit several times and each time the alarms would go off and after waiting several minutes we would have to go get a nurse. Some were well within hearing distance and we were always told they would be there when they were done with whatever else they were doing which was never with another patient.  Sad to say but If I ever need medical care in the future I don't want to be taken there.

Was told by a friend that this was the best Mex in town. The hubs LOVES chips and sauce so we checked it out. It was obvious that they are new and have a few kinks to iron out but the food is not one of them. I ordered the quesadilla with fajita style pollo esado and he ordered fajita style carne asada tacos w/ rice and beans.  Plenty of chips and sauce we delivered to the table and the chips were freshly made. Salsa was delicious and not too spicy.  I'm sure it will only get better as they are open a while longer. I will def. go back and also tell my friends about it.
