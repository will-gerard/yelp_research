I've been taking my Honda to Tait at Hon-Man since I turned 16. I have always loved how reliable Honda cars were, but when my car broke down three years ago, one of the main reasons I bought another Honda was because of this auto shop. His prices are extremely fair, and he is always completely honest about what needs to be done. As a female who knows nothing about cars, it would be so easy for a mechanic to take advantage of my ignorance and charge me for it, but I know I can trust Tait and all of the staff at Hon-Man. Honestly the best shop, people, and overall experience! I highly recommend you check it out for all of your auto needs.

Literally the only good thing about this restaurant is the location. Aside from that, I honestly have absolutely nothing good to say. We waited 45+ minutes for food, & when the food FINALLY arrived, 3 of the 4 orders were wrong AND cold. It was so bad we complained, & waited an additional 25 minutes for one replacement order, & an hour later we're still waiting for the right eggs. When I told the MANAGER that we were still waiting on eggs, we were told that we had just put the order in, when in REALITY we had put it in over an hour & a half ago. After complaining, we were told we wouldn't have to pay for any food, which then changed to having to only pay for 2 of the four meals, & yet, when we received the check, we were billed for 3 of the 4 meals. We complained, AGAIN, & now only have to pay for drinks. But the damage has not been remedied, this was a TERRIBLE experience. I personally witnessed one table next to us walk out, & another on the verge of following in their lead. I want to preface this by saying that I only write reviews when they are either really good or really terrible, but that being said, I would highly encourage you to avoid this restaurant at all costs. In fact, I would rather go digging in a dumpster.

Deana is not only an amazing hair stylist, but she is an all around awesome person. She does great work & I feel very comfortable with her & trust that she knows what she is doing with my hair. She takes the time to make sure she understands what you want done, & also offers helpful tips & advice of what she thinks would look best. My hair always looks amazing when I leave, so I love scheduling an appointment before a fun event or party. Deana is also a great person to chat with for a couple hours while you get your hair done. She is awesome & I would highly recommend her!

There is just something about Josefa that makes working with her such an uplifting, magical, and enlightening experience. I have been seeing Josefa for life coaching and various readings since 2012. I have been trying to put my finger on what exactly makes her so unique and special, and have come to the conclusion that it's actually a multitude of things. Josefa has a special ability to be able to relate and empathize with any issue I bring to her. She is able to shed light on any situation I'm in and help me see it in a way that better serves not only me and my life, but also the specific situation or relationship. When I leave a session, I am always armed with practical and useful tools that I can begin to implement into my life immediately. (This means a lot to a person who always wants to feel like they are in control and is continually looking for ways to grow as a human!) To this day, I find myself utilizing things she taught me two years ago. She has a wealth of information and is constantly learning more to better serve her clients. I have had several breakthroughs since I've been seeing Josefa, and I have seen real, lasting changes in my life, attitude, and relationships. (She even helped me manifest the man of my dreams and bring him into my life!) She has a knack for being able to see the bigger picture, and also for making you dig deeper to find out what is really going on - the root of your problems or desires. But most importantly, she really, truly cares about her clients. This is evidenced by not only the feeling you get when you're with her (that lasts long after the session is over), but also by her follow through. She always checks in to see how I am doing, and she remembers things that I tell her. She truly is amazing and well worth the investment. I give Josefa my highest recommendation, and my deepest appreciation for continuously helping me change my life in the most positive ways!

This training studio has it all! The GroupFit classes are affordable and offered at convenient times. Not to mention, you can add on yoga for cheap, & the instructores are great! Nick is the owner and trainer, and his is awesome. He is knowledgeable about fitness, supplements, nutrition, and more. Since I began training with Nick, I have gotten much stronger, and I can see and feel the difference; I even cut 18 minutes off of my half marathon time! He has helped me change my diet, and I feel healthy and energized. He really cares about his clients, and even in a group setting, he works with you individually to get you to your goals. He is extremely helpful, & I would highly recommend this studio & all it has to offer!
