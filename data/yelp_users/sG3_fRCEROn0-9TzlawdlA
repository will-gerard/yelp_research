I love going to sporting events and one of my favorite places to go is Us Airways for them! It could be because I am a huge Suns and Mercury fan but I would like it if all the AZ sporting events were here. Why? Because it is centrally located! I like that it is fairly clean (depending on what you are going to see) and kids friendly. I am also a fan of how many eating establishments there are near by now.

Popes round table is the best place to sit with a large group! Out of everywhere my book club has tried this is our collective favorite. We can see and hear each other, our service is always good and so is our food. I know we will be back in the future!

I am not usually the Trader Joes kinda gal, with four kids I usually shop in pretty large quantities but lately I can't seem to stay away.... from the wine section.  No but really, it is now my favorite store to grab what I need for dinner, along with a bottle of wine and fresh flowers!  Often I find what I am looking for but sometimes they don't carry some of the items I need.  If you need a special item I would suggest calling to see if they have it before heading there.  My kids like the little shopping carts that are perfect for them and they LOVE finding the lizard, when they find her they get a prize out of the treasure box!  The staff is always kind and helpful.  I am sure I will back again sometime this week!!

I am not much of a Yogi but I do love yoga now and then. When I feel the urge to put on my yoga pants and do a few sun salutations I head over to Gilbert Yoga. I have been there for several workshops as well and even my kids have enjoyed the kid's yoga class. I highly recommend Gilbert Yoga!

Green is the new black, just don't tell my husband! Actually, he might agree with me. Finally got the meat eater to come to Green for the first time and he was in heaven! It was my third time there and this time I got the Spicy Thai dish and my husband got the Kung Pao. Both meals were delicious, filling and satisfying.  We may actually head back there for dinner tonight!

Oh, Macayo's you used to be so great.     I have been to Depot Cantina many times and it used to be my favorite place to get dinner and drinks before heading out on Mill Ave. But over the years it has really started to decline. Our server was nice but not very informed or attentive.    I was extremely disappointed in the food. The salsa tasted like someone accidentally dumped a bag of salt in it and my  veggie fajitas only had broccoli, carrots and zucchini. It wouldn't have been so bad if there were saut√©ed onions and bell peppers to go with but nothing about it said "Mexican food."  Food aside, I have to say that the entertainment was really good. It was one guy and a guitar who sang Boys In The Hood by Easy E and Lovesong by Cure (or Adele depending on how old you are).  I am sure that I will be back at least for drinks but I hope that they work on improving the evening service, Depot Cantina is a staple in Tempe and I would hate to see it go any further downhill.

I got Banged again last night and it was great! We went to Big Bang to wait for our friends to meet up with us, and ended up staying for almost the whole night. Our server, Shelley was AWESOME! She let us know when a bigger table became available and I was never without a drink in my hand. The crowd was completely into the show and it looked like everyone was having a great time, not a sour puss in the place.  The performers are all so talented they even rocked Paper Planes by MIA!

The first time I was ever here was with my book club. It is a little small for a group our size but that's my only complaint. I have been there a few times since then and always received good service and great food.  The desserts are AMAZING! This is one of my go to spots in Gilbert for a solo lunch or dinner.  I would give it 5 starts but I was reminded that just because I thought my waitress was really hot that didn't mean they get an extra star ; )

This is a place for families! They accommodate large groups easily and have a great family oriented atmosphere.  Their servers are always on top of their game and very friendly.

I never thought I would say that Ethiopian food is my favorite food but a few years ago I met a woman from Ethiopia who introduced me to the cuisine.  Over the years we parted ways but my love for the food was still there! Now anytime I am craving the earthy hearty vegetarian wat and injera I just head over to Tina's. Not only is the food great Tina herself is lovely and always willing to answer any questions I have. Sometimes the wait is a little long but it is totally worth it!

I have been going to Desert Springs dental for years and have not had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and available when I need them. It almost feels like I have a dentist in the family now... I highly recommend them!

I was so disappointed the last time I came here. I ordered a vegetarian dish with fried tofu and had a piece of chicken in the dish.  The cooks need to be a little more aware and make sure nothing remains on the wok before they prepare the next meal. I would like to note to that it is not an issue because there is a dead chicken in my food but because if I eat meat I get a terrible tummy ache.  And no one wants a tummy ache.

I have been going to Urban for a few years now. I love to sample all the different teas and of course indulge in the delicious food! I have gone with kids and adults and have always had a pleasant experience. Plan ahead, good food can take some time to prepare, but as I always say, it's worth the wait.

Indian food is one of my favorites, and I don't know why it took me so long to try Guru. I have been there now several times and I opt to order off the menu instead of the buffet. Every meal I have had has been very good and has all those warm comforting spices I love in Indian food. And of course who can forget the garlic naan, delicious! The staff have always been very friendly and answered any questions that I have had. Guru has become a regular lunch spot for me!

Took my kids here last summer and although my older two (11 and 9) were a little too old and "too cool" for it  and my two little ones (4 and 6) LOVED it! Their favorite things were painting the castle and playing with the sand light box. My favorite thing was watching all the kids take on life roles in the grocery store and restaurants. It was amazing to see how quickly and easily they all chose a job and fell right into it without conflict or questions.   I was just recently back for Yelp's pleY Date event and I have to admit it was more fun as an adult sans children ; ) I always climb the tree house with my kids but climbing it with my adult friends was a blast! We will be visiting again this summer, at least my little two and I will be!

When I first went raw I was worried it meant that I would never eat out again so you can imagine my excitement when I found out about 24 Carrots. I went for Raw Wednesday (although I believe they have a raw option everyday) and had the "Cheese Burger." It was so delicious that I ended up ordering the other raw option on the menu to take home for dinner. The atmosphere was casual and welcoming and the staff was willing and able to answer all of my questions.  This is one you should add to your list whether you are raw or not!

I LOVE Noca! It is my favorite place to go in the valley. It is so amazing just thinking about it makes my mouth water. The food is always fresh, they use the best ingredients possible and it is obvious.  I am a vegetarian and there is always a veg option on the menu.  Everything from the wine pairing to the background music has been perfected to the finest detail.  My favorite is dessert though... Salted Butter Gelato, it's orgasmic!  So satisfying, if I were a smoker I'd need a cigarette when I am done.

Yummy pizza and ok wine, but not a place for large groups.   I went the other day with my wine/book club. We had made reservations but when we got there the hostess told use that she could not seat us till  of our group was there.  Unfortunately when we were finally seated the table did not accommodate the size of our group. It would have been really nice to not have to worry about this and instead be able to come in sit down, enjoy a glass of wine and wait for the rest of the party to arrive and relax more. (I would have drunk more wine btw.) I know that there were a few issues with the orders too, although my order was correct.  Maybe it was an overly busy night, short staff or poor organization?? Anyway, I would go back if someone else wanted to go there but it would not be my 1st choice.

I am updating my review and giving Grimaldi's  2 extra stars for customer service! Shortly after I posted my review I received an email from the Restaurant Manager and he apologized for the service and offered for me to come in and meet with him to discuss my review.  I have been too busy to take him up on his offer but we have exchanged emails. I now look forward to trying Grimaldi's again, maybe with my family (which is still a good size group of 6) and see what changes they may have made and what they can offer!

Gordon Biersch is now one of my favorite go-to spots because they have vegan, vegetarian and gluten free food menus. It is a great place to go with a diverse group with diverse needs. And of course, they have BEER. Beer is always good.

As much as I like to support small local businesses I don't think I will be back anytime soon to Baci. Very few vegetarian options, it was a little pricy and the service was sssslllllooooowwww.  It might be ok for drinks at the bar but not for a family dinner, which is a bummer.

I have only been to this Massage Envy location a couple of times but this last time was the best! I was able to make my appointment easily and we greeted kindly by the front desk staff. My therapist was great and did exactly what I wanted her to do, help me relax.  Hummmm this reminds me, I need to make another appointment, time for my next massage!

I heard people rave about JP Pancake for a while now so one morning we decided to check it out. The place is cute and homey feeling. Our server was nice but the poor thing was spread very thin and had a hard time keeping up with her tables. We all ordered different things from the menu and we all agreed that the food was average.  Although, it was not the best experience, it was also not the worse. I have them on my list to try again.... Maybe next time I will try one of their famous baked pancakes!

'Wine run' just doesn't sound as good as 'beer run', I need to come up with a better rhyme. ... I love wine but I don't know much about it and that's why I like to go to Total Wine and More. I can walk in and just get what I know I like or I can ask one of the staff there to suggest a wine. They are FULL of information and very helpful. They also have a pretty good cigar and of course liquor selection. This is my go to place for purchasing wine.

Sometimes it's difficult to really feel satisfied with a raw vegan diet , but every time I go to Pomegranate's I leave more than satisfied.   The atmosphere is welcoming and delightful, although very busy during the lunch rush. I did have to share a table with a stranger last time I was there but the stranger turned out to be a great lunch companion.  This is a must for anyone who is considering (or already is) a raw and/or vegan diet.  Everything is so yummy you won't know it is good for you!

I heard that Thai Chili was good but I never got around to trying it until this week. And I gotta say they were right! I love the fact that you can order it as spicy as you want (or as mild as you want for you whimps)  and that they had a few vegetarian options, not just 1. I will be back.... I may even become a regular!

I didn't even know this place was here until my husband come home one day and said he ate a ghost pepper  After about a week of referring to him as "spice butt hole" he decided we should both go check out the place. When I got there I was pleased to see that he had invited a few of my friends and family to celebrate the start of my new business!  The group was of about 10 people and our server did a great job, our beer glasses were never empty, our food was yummy and quick and he separated the checks without any difficulty. I go places with groups often (like book club) and these things are important and all too often rare. It's not too far from home and a great place to just hang out. I recommend it and will be back!

I love Thai food so when I was up in the North side of the valley I figured I would give this place a try. I ordered the yellow curry, it was good but not as good as I expected it to be based on the reviews I read.  I won't be making a special trip to go there again but if I am in the area I will consider it and maybe try something else off the menu.

I LOVE THRIVE!!!! They are my favorite place to go for a yummy treat. It tastes sinfully delicious but it's heavenly good for you! No added junk, just healthy delicious fruit pureed to a soft serve consistency with oats and honey for an extra treat! My favorite is the peanut butter! What kind are you going to try?

We celebrated my daughters 11th birthday at Monsterland last week and she had a blast! We went for dinner on a Wednesday night and made reservations in advance. All the kids dressed up as zombies for the occasion. Even though it was our servers first day on the job she did great! The food was average bar type fair, but I am a vegetarian so I did not try any of the meat times which I was told were good.  The homemade chips were yummy and the adults had a great time trying the different beers. I know we will be back, but next time it won't be with the kids, I want to see what this place has to offer at night!  Maybe I'll come in costume....

My kids LOVE  PS Yogurt! This is the perfect place to go to cool off after a hot day or just as an afterschool treat. The kids love picking their favorite flavors and toppings. They also really enjoy the chalk wall! Personally  I would really like  it if they had a vegan frozen treat like coconut milk or banana (hint hint)  I am sure we will be there several times this summer!

What a fun date night! I have not gone to a shooting range in in YEARS so when my husband planned on us going for date night I was a little apprehensive. The minute we walked in we were greeted by the staff. It was a pretty full night but we did not have to wait long for our lane and while we waited the gentleman behind the counter explained the rental gun choices to me and helped me pick one. All and all the service was great and my zombie shooting skills aren't too bad either ;)

I have been here a few times since they opened.  The wine is terrific, the food delicious but boy was it crowded! I have gone with large groups and the wait is always at least 2 hrs. One time we sat on the grass area and were still served, which was like a picnic, very nice. The second time we all chose to eat somewhere else but came back for drinks after dinner when it was much less crowded.  It would be nice to be able to make reservations so next time we can all stay and get the full experience.  It delights me to see a place in Gilbert as happening as this place is! I will be back to try with a large group again at the end of the month BUT I might just have to treat myself to lunch there before then, it's not possible to go there too often is it?

So I am going to let you in on a secret, sometimes (meaning once a week) I drop my kids off at school, ignore my other responsibilities for the morning and  go to The Good Egg for breakfast. I always know what to expect, great service, great food and great prices. They have yet to let me down. Can't wait for school to start again, so I can get back to playing hooky and hang out at The Good Egg.

I love to eat healthy but when I am out and about it is very difficult to stick to a vegan/ wheat free diet and that's why I LOVE Uprooted Kitchen! I go as often as possible to the Gilbert Farmers Market  for many reasons, but I always save time for breakfast  I have had some delicious food there and some that they are working on perfecting.  They have a creative menu and I can only see them getting better as time go on.  This is REAL food made with LOVE, and it's obvious to see and taste.

Chocolate covered strawberries with my meal as a treat? Yes please!  I went there for the first time last week and had the Thai salad with tofu and it was very yummy. They are quick, efficient and my pocket really likes their prices. The only problem was that we don't have a location near my house (aawwwhhh) BUT I just found out that they are opening another location in Dana Park (Val Vista and Baseline ) wwwwweeeeee! Do you know where you can find me for lunch in the near future?? Caf√© Zupas!!

I was so excited when I saw that Caf√© Zupas was going right by my business. I have now been there my fair share of times for lunch and the food is always yummy, quick and for the most part healthy. I love that I know which items are vegetarian without asking   and can get any type of protein (like tofu) on any of the salads. My favorite thing to eat is the mushroom soup and who doesn't love the chocolate covered strawberries they give out with each meal! One of my favorite things as a mom for 4 kids is that when our whole family goes there it only costs us around $30, that is cheaper than getting drive thru food! Definitely a win in my book!

Love. That is the only word needed to describe Lisa of Sacred hArts! I have been to many workshops, celebrations and yoga classes she has offered and every time I leave feeling better about myself and more connected to universe. I also use essential oil blends and skin care products from Sacred hArts and love the scent and feel of my skin after I use them. If you are well on your path or just starting Sacred hArts is the best place for you to get what you are seeking, Lisa is knowledgeable and able to help you with whatever your needs are. I am excited to see what she will be offering next!

When I first walked in I fell in love with the decor. It is clean, fun, trendy and still felt high end. There was only one couple in line in front of us and they let us order first because they could not decide what they wanted to eat. The staff was nice, clean and had a hip vib.  We ordered and found a seat easily and our drinks came out right away. I had the Sandi, a breakfast sandwich with honeyed bacon, cheese (I cant remember what type), arugula with an egg. The flavors played off each other well. I think for the type of food being served their price point is spot on. The only thing I did not care for was the coffee, it is probably a great coffee for people who cream and sugar but not for black coffee, in my opinion. Our food arrived in a timely fashion too.  There was a steady flow of customers and everyone seemed to be pleased.  I plan on trying it out again next time I am in the area.
