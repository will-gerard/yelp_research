Ordered a beef and cheese burrito ( once the waitress decided it was time to saunter over) for my son- he got an all beef burrito and an eye roll from the expediter when I asked for a side of cheese. The carnitas ( bland) were to come with guacamole; no one mentioned they were out of avocado, and I only found out after I received my meal without it and over-hearing another table ask where Their's was. Had to ask for refills- from the expediter ( really another waiter who had to take up the slack). Really, really disappointing.

The food is great, but have to concur with the customer service issues of late. Guy at front forgot to ring up the fries we ordered, treated like criminals when we asked where they were. Look at the ticket, not on there. Husband goes up to reorder, guy says on him, his fault, says will take care of. 10 minutes later, nothing. Same guy in back has same attitude, takes another 10 minutes to finally end FryGate. Really?

Atmosphere- charming, converted house. Music- older hip hop, any band Q-Tip was in, some surprises. Two TVs, a localvore approach down to the draft beers, and the best BLT around. Looking forward to returning!

Service, all stars. I had the spicy dragon bowl with tofu and kelp noodles ( pro tip: ask for sriracha if you like heat), and it was delish. I'll be back- likely tomorrow!  Not your average vegan restaurant ( i.e. Bland)

Amazing food, the kind of place that knows you by name ( certainly me, I eat their food every week, usually more than once!), and they aren't afraid to bring the heat. I go between Thai hot and a 4/5 ( I notice that it's hotter when I'm in person), and can't go wrong with the pad siew, pad thai, or any of the curries ( the panang is stellar). Oh, and they deliver!

Great orange chicken, soups, and summer rolls. The curry and pad Thai is...not what I'm used to, but not bad as long as you expect something new. However, the service could not be better. Oh, and try the boba!  Update: if the owner isn't working, service is not quite the same level

This would be a three but the drive through service has been so wretched ( maybe hire people that actually want to work here) I can't give that rating.

Excellent, enthusiastic service, the BRI beers were legitimately tasty, and the food did not disappoint. "Meat candy"- sriracha candied bacon- need I say more? The fries seemed from scratch and disappeared before I could really get a feel for them- more 'research' is in order. ;-)
