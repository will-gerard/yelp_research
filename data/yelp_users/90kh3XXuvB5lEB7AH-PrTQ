Like today I had the delicious veggie burger and last week I had the monterey omlet. All very good. And the pamosas are awesome. Oj pomagrante juice and champagne. So tasty!

This is my new go to brunch spot! Tom the bartender (whos super cute) hooks it up! Let him have his way with you(r drinks) and he won't steer you wrong. First beverage he brought me was a blackberry champagne mojito super light and refreshing. The second was also a champagne cocktail of sorts, I believe it had some sort of peach puree in it. It was absolutely delightful!  The coolest thing about it was it had a sphere of ice in it that looked like a crystal ball. Magical!  As for the food it also didn't disappoint. Tom suggested we start with cheese stuffed jalapenos not fried. Oohy gooey and oh so tasty. My entree was the huevous rancheros pretty straight forward but lighter and crispier than I've had before served with roasted root veggies. Surely palate pleasing!

This is the closest coffee shop to my house. It's  super cool that it's a retro gas station where you can actually pull up to the pump to get your cup. Not only with tasty beverages they also offer yummy treats, gluten free and vegan options as well. Copper star coffee is a must try if you are in the Melrose district.

pretty darn tasty if you ask me!  I picked up to go on the way home, i really wanted to go to Bangkok Thai but its not really on my way home so i thought i would check out this little gem.  Of course my order consisted of Chicken Green Curry med and Pad thai combo and usually I get Tom Kah but I went for beef satay this time cause the bf, who has never had thai before, asked for something with beef.  The green curry tasted just as expected, creamy and delish with just the perfect amount of spice for med, i prefer it hotter but again the bf is new to thai. The pad thai was lacking on the protein front for being combo but the flavor was quite nice even though the noodles were a little too sticky. Im not a huge skewered beef fan but my bf enjoyed every last bit of the beef satay. I do have to say the peanut sauce was lacking a little heat even though it was tasty.  Whenever I have a hankering for some thai on my way from home work i will definately have this place on my radar.

Great food, awesome atmosphere.  Love this place.  The salmon superfood is to to die for as well as the squash with goat cheese, a must have.

I love this grocery store. Fresh prepackaged items. They're lemon cilantro hummus is killer, I love it with they're pre cut packaged jicama sticks. They also have a fabulous and well priced wine section. The store is located right on the corner of 7th ave and Indian school, perfect location to swing in and grab a quick after work fresh meal. I love you fresh and easy;)

So I have tried this place twice now and I am still not a fan.   I do have to say the ambiance is quite beautiful, but the food and drink are a total rip off. 3 half dollar size tacos with no sides for 16 bucks blows my mind. And $12 for half a cup of guacamole is outrageous. I'm sorry!

This place has incredible Thai food!!!!!!  The only reason I dock this place a star is because when I stopped to pickup my take out the lady kept my change as her "TIP", ALL $9 OF IT!!!!!!. Who does that !?!? Yes I should of asked for it back, but the balls on this woman I figure she must really need it!  Anyway the food is a must on flavor. The green curry is some of the best I have ever tasted. The Tom Kah was a tad greasy but so delish, and the pad thai was actually light and pleasant compared to most places where it is super over whelming.  I will return to Bangkok Thai Bar-B-Q time and time again for delicious what Thai is supposed to taste like food. I am super duper impressed.

I really really wanted to love this place. Great location, super cut atmosphere, food looks good. But it really fell short. The salad was eh and and the pizza WAY under seasoned. I read in another review it was too salty, I wish I had some of their salt. Even though the food was just mediocre the service is really what ruined it for me. I chose to sit in the bar, as im a bar fly, plus I think they have more specials in there. Anyways, all the tables were occupied except for two dirty ones, a high top and a booth. I opted for the high top, im sure I sat there a good 15 min before anyone stopped to help clean the mess. Sure I got lots of eye contact but no one seemed to want to serve me. So I moved to the dirty booth. It was cleaned quickly. My server showed up with menus and wanted a drink order stat! Whoa nelly! i asked if i could have a couple mins to decide on wine ( half off btls of wine on mondays) and for my guest to arriive. well bad idea cause then it took her like an hour to return. and this set the mood for the rest of our meal. at one point we had to get the busser to grab her and another i had to get up to order another bottle of wine from the bar. towards the end of our vist we were hoping for a pizzookie, well turns out the kitchen had been closed without our knowledge. too bad, i doubt ill be back

I was sadly disappointed, after reading all the excellent I thought it was shoe in. not so much. Long wait for food then it was just ok. Id rather pay more for food that tastes amazing and doesn't take forever to get.

I visited squid ink this past Saturday for my friends birthday and lets just say my socks were rocked.  A friend and I shared the sashimi platter and the cougar roll both outstanding! The sashimi platter came with salmon, yellowtail (my fave), ahi, octopus, and because the server told me there was albacore even tho there isn't albacore. The fish was some of the freshest I have had in phoenix.  The cougar roll consisted of spicy crab mix avocado and some other stuff with a cucumber wrap. Light and delicious. I also had the pleasure of meeting the owner, Schuyler, very nice and pretty darn cute too ;)  I will definitely be back. Squid ink is my new go to for sushi!

Snooze is a-maze-ing! I have not had a single thing that I didn't even not like a little bit. The pancakes are to die for. Get a flight so you can try 3 different kinds. The OMG French toast is seriously "Oh My Goodness this is delish!" Each and every one of the Benedict's are a knock out, its so hard to choose they let you get to different kinds on one plate!  The only thing I think could be a little bit improved on is the hash browns they don't wow but it doesn't stop me from enjoying the shit out of them with a perfectly cooked over medium egg on top.  I've yet to try the drinks but I'm sure they won't disappoint! Snooze is a definite must!!

I don't know why this place has bad reviews.  Its an old apartment complex of course its gonna have a few minor issues, its old. I moved in here for the very fact its old, its got character and charm. Everything that has ever broken or needed to be fixed has been, the very day I ask for it to be. If you want a shiny brand new apt move into a shiny brand new apartment.   The floor plans are a great deal for the price. Utilities are low. And I have never had a problem washing my clothes.  You knew when you moved in it had laundry rooms, sometimes you gotta wait or learn to do your laundry at less busy times. Not hard at all.  Devon in the office is awesome and she's a wonderful property manager.  You people try running a apartment office and listen to people bitch at you all day long. Its a tough job and she is doing it very well. Thank you Devon;)  I love living here and I will continue to do so for sometime.

I am madly in love with the lavender white chocolate latte.  Its creamy and delish with the perfect amount of lavender where its not over powering and you can still taste the white chocolate.  I also highly recommend the breakfast burritos. The veggie Is my fave. Fluffy scrambled eggs laced with cheddar cheese and seasonal veggies.  The tortilla its self is something to talk about. Its fluffy and light almost like a pita in style. It really adds to make this burrito the stand out it is. Served with a side of salsa and big enough to share.  Not to mention this place is built on charity.  Part of the proceeds go to help refugees and all of the arts for sale inside are made by the refugees themselves.  This place is a definite on the list of places to go.!
