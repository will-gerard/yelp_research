I try to judge a place by how good it is at what IT does and what they do they do well here. In terms of quick and affordable buffet Indian eateries they seem to have it down.   I work in the area and often need a break from the Biltmore and Esplanade fare. When I head over here I tell the guys in the office and I always have a couple jump to go with me. The guests' first reaction is the same every time; we pull into the strip mall and skeptically get out eyeing the place which is unassuming on the outside to say the least. We open the door and walk in and you get the inevitable, "Wow it smells good in here". You are shown your table and asked for your drink order and then asked to help your self. You will find 8-10 entree dishes + salads, chutney and desert waiting for you that has all been consistently fresh hot, well prepared and thankfully light on the heavy cream that all Indian places pour into every dish to make the, um... crackers eat exotic foods. They bring fresh Naan bread (included) to your table and have a full menu available as well.   The place is owner run and they are polite and attentive. Indian movie dance scenes run the background on a TV set a volume that does not interfere with your conversation and you can get in and out quick between meetings if you need to. Your guests who picked carefully on their first trip return to the table with a second, full, plate and eat until they complain they ate too much because it was so good. Lunch for 2 with iced-tea is about $22 - quite deal as well.

Ok, I've been a big Richardson's fan since back in the day and love the Rokerij as well. I've been going there since literally before it opened (the dry run) and have always had good food and service that ranges from acceptable to great with one notable exception. On that occasion I called and complained just to make the manger aware and she made it right and made it impossible to complain any further. This is an insider place that I tell and take out of town business guests to as well. Although I liked it more before the remodel when it was a bit more formal and different from Richardson's. Now the menus are much more similar but Rokerij has tapas items, I think they call small plates almost all of which are awesome, especially the Brie Toasts with Steak. I remember when they first changed the menu we went in and someone said, "Wait a minute, this is the same as the damn Richardson's menu", we looked at each other and said, "Sweet" and enjoyed our meals anyway. My cork-dork friends like the wine list and I like the cocktails. The atmosphere is nice but casual, dark wood, big booths, fireplace and etc. they have a decent bar downstairs (and one upstairs as well) where you can also eat if you want to sit in a line at the bar (also three booths and another fireplace with couch and club chairs) but it makes me a bit claustrophobic to be locked in there. Parking is easy with the new lot they added and the place is busy most nights of the week so if you are going with a group call ahead.

I eat here at least once a week due to convenience and time, it's near my office. The service is uniformly excellent, the menu is basic but changes slightly almost daily and the prices are reasonable most of the time. They often have surprises at lunch on the specials menu and are very accommodating with changes, dietary restrictions and general fussiness that sometimes happens when everyone is on a diet. The GM Robin and Asst. Lise are a pleasure to deal with as well. Yes, it's a chain, and sometimes feels like it, but the beauty of chains is a dependable level or service and consistent value and food quality, they deliver on all three.

It's Houston's what kind of revelation were you expecting? Uniformly excellent service administered by the manager "T", who is always gracious and helpful; and every dish prepared exactly the same way every time. My favorites are the Hawaiian Rib-eye, french dip, and Thai Beef and noodle salad. Ice tea is dark and fresh and cocktails are strong. Nice outdoor space for lunch as well, despite a bit of road noise from Camelback. I eat here at least once a month, typically more and have never had a bad meal or service. True, it's a chain a foodies like to bitch about "the man" but they do what they do very well.

I have been eating here since they opened 10 years ago. Very good consistent food at an amazing value. The owner Sam is there most of the time and takes good care of his diners most of whom are neighborhood regulars. We get take out from here every week and have tried most of what is on menu at least once. If you are unsure what to order definitely consider the various family  dinner options and come hungry. Easy parking, full bar, simple neighborhood place with emphasis on food not décor.

Dr. Nick Warner is great at what he does, concerned about care, not just billing and works harder on me when I'm in his office than any other Dr. I have seen. He is a guy who seems to be aware that he is providing a SERVICE - and delivers it with great skill and compassion. Take it from a reformed skeptic like me and see him for help when you need it. I have also bought massage gift certicicates as gifts with 5 star reviews. He treated me after some stupid cow slammed into me at full speed while I was stopped at a red light and helped reduce chronic and agonizing pain pain I suffered for almost a year.

I've been a Char's patron since before we were legal to be in there (many years ago, previous owners). It has always been a lively place with a diverse crowd of aging black hep-cats, college students, bikers, tweakers, college students, heavy middle aged white women who love black men, the ocassional tranny and Hispanic couples on dates with a sprinkling of occasional stippers/hookers. In other words - everything you would want to make a blues bar entertaining and just seedy enough to be interesting.   They are one of the only places in Central Phoenix with live music almost every night of the week and the cover, if any, is typically only a couple of bucks. The place is small and dark and crowded, like a blues bar in an old converted house should be. Talent varies by night but anytime you go it's passable. Personal favorites are lady J and Bam Bam and any combination thereof, which is what you usually get any way. Wander in on a random Monday night and 11:30 and you will find music, cruising, and drinks waiting. There is a small enclosed patio up front for smoking, about 16 spaces in their lot and street parking available on the residential street, but watch the signs and don't block driveways. You can also cross 7th Ave, but be careful dodging cars. The neighborhood looks scarier than it is so don't be alarmed by a transient or two wandering down the street but they don't bite unless you pay extra. Close to lite rail as well in case sneaker pimps want to try to cross over from Central, but hopefully they won't.

I'm a card carrying (literally, they gave me frequent diner card that's supposed to get me free stuff, haven't seen it yet though) fan of Malees, the real one in old Town Scottsdale, not that B.S. up North. Consistently GREAT food and good service, large portions and well priced too. Our most recent Trip was on mother's Day, we saw Stomp and came out hungry around 4pm - we called and got in before the crowd w/no reservations and had yet another great meal.   The atmosphere is casual but nice and the emphasis is on the food. Malees is located on 5th Ave just west of Scottsdale and has a TON of street parking available as most of galleries that surround it are closed at dinner time anyway. They also serve lunch, man I need to go there more often! Favorite Standout dishes include the traditional soups, Thai Stick appetizers, the best fried tofu in town with peanut dipping sauce (a really simple dish that's apparently easy to f*ck up based on what I've had elsewhere), beef panang (not on the menu so just order it), of course pad-thai and a dish I think they call candied fish that is two HUGE whitefish fillets that are very lightly breaded and flash fried and drizzled with a sweet chilie sauce, to call it sweet and sour would be insulting, way better and more nuanced. They have anice little patio when weather permits, can take parties from 2 to 8 with no problem and take and actually KEEP reservations. (Am I the only one who gets pissed if he makes a reservation, shows up on the dot and waits an hour?) Crowd is mixed and widely varied from new age sandal-foots exploring the East by eating noodles to tourists, locals, first dates, and of course the usual assortment of Indian and Asian families that lets you know they know how to use spices. I'd give it five stars as pefection if the decor was a little more exciting, it's not bad, just not all that it could be on that front, but here I am really looking for one thing to complain about - this is one of my favorite places in town and a place I always take visting guests.

Great NORTH Indian food, not to be confused with crappy South Indian food. This place has been through a couple of location changes since it first opened in Phoenix in 1985 at 44th St. and Camelback just down from Cork & Cleaver. Its current home in the Scottsdale Civic Center is easy to get to with lots of parking in the adjacent garage. The décor is the nicest I have seen at any Indian place in town and the owners are usually there and make sure the food is consistent and good. They have a wide range of both meat and vegetable dishes and the "Jewel Dinner" at only $25 per head is a great way to go for both experts and novices. It includes a rack of grilled meats and fish as an appetizer, a sampling of four or five dishes and even dessert! Also, be sure to try the stuffed breads or "naans" they can be had with potatoes, lamb, chicken, etc, and are phenomenal.

Old School Arizona Mexican place with lots of quirky nooks and crannies. Great place to take out of town guests to show them something uniquely AZ and watch them sweat as they suffer through their spicy carne adovada that's so delicious they can't stop eating it. Large menu with all the familiar family Mexican classics, reasonable prices, a variety of combos for those that can't choose.  Lots of patio seating too but it's mostly in the sun. Margaritas available by the glass or by the pitcher, delicious.

Consistently good food & service. Modern Asian Fusion in case you don't know what they do. Healthy options available, lots of great choices in both meat and vegetarian dishes. This location is owner managed which always makes me happy and heopeful that somone is paying attention to details. They apparenty have a pretty great happy hour and small plate program as well althought I go there and order full meals. They also have a nice private room for meetings with AV set up and etc. I can only hope that Brenda, the owner, will re-open the Biltmore location that somone else had, I'll come at least once a week - promise.

Eh. Had a business lunch there recently and was underwhelmed. A couple of things were good, one was great and couple were absolutely undistinguished.   Lunch for 4 was $200, and a couple of people left hungry.   Great dish with grilled fish on brussel sprouts in horseradish cream sauce, and one of the sushi rolls was great, look for teh one with Saracha. They don't have ice-tea. Atmosphere is a bit like dining at a restaurant in a mall, because that's where it is. Oysters were the smallest I've ever seen, literally. Service was passable.

Good Arcadia/Biltmore area place that's in a neat setting off 40th St. and Camelback - you know, behind the gas station.   The place is very popular and packed at lunch and early for dinner. Come at 11:30 or 1 or expect to wait and have to valet if the lot is not full. Food has been consistently good, fresh and well portioned. Place is loud and casual but upscale. I described it to one person as the kind of healthy fashionable place where the wives, mistresses and exes of all the guys eating at Houston's are eating ( I pause here to make a cougar claw motion with my hand), when they are not clogging up Postino's parking lot or backing into my f*cking car at La Grande Orange. They even have some similar menu items and do upscale "American" grill food like salads, burgers, pasta and the other usual suspects with a couple of surprises thrown in.   The nice thing about the kind of generic menu is that there is something on it for every taste and dietary restriction no matter how fussy. I'll clarify, I don't use "generic" in the pejorative sense, I'm just saying they have all the usual stuff of a place of this type. Lots of loose action in the house here.

Mediocre - best thing that happened to them was Richardson's fire, perhaps they can get over flow from Dick's while Rich Brown rebuilds.   The place is decent inside, has a patio where you can't smoke and a bar and more parking than you would think given the awkward lot it was shoehorned into. My issues are food and service. Food is average & inconsistent and service is typically light on attention to detail. God forbid you go in for a late dinner. They bang stuff around, move chairs and stare while you are trying to finish. If you f8ckers want to close at 8, do it, but change the sign on the door and stop taking orders at 7.

Olive and B.S.   Once again the hype outlives the product. I had lunch there again today and left disappointed again. I eat lunch out 5 days a week always at nice places mostly on business. This place does not stand up against others in the neighborhood and price range. Parking is always a hassle the valet is a mess and takes too long because the garage is a way off by Urban Outfitters. The cafeteria'-like ambiance and small tables are awkward for business and because the place is always packed service is slow but always friendly with the exception of the vapid 16 year old hostesses. After putting my folder on the floor, no space on the table, I ordered. Veal and spinach ravioli, four very small excellent ravioli for $15, one of which was gristle and which I had to spit out. The portion was a ridiculous excuse for an entree portion. I'm done with this place and don't see going back. It's just not worth the price or hassle, especially given the 100 other choices within a three block radius.

Amazing view, possibly one of the best in Vegas from the 64th floor of THE HOTEL.  Great food, great service, in a dramatic room with modern lighting, furnishings and floor to ceiling glass. The waiters were going all out to earn their tips and everyone left happy, full and delighted. Frankly one the better experiences I've had in a "high end" Vegas eatery in YEARS! Menu has a wide variety from mild to wild. Standouts included lobster ceaser, tuna tar-tar, foie-gras, chicken surf and turf with stuffed chicken breast and crabmeat...  After, or before, spend some time in the amazing bar that is attached with the same outstanding strip views. AAA wine list and good strong cocktails. Worth the wait and every penny, I'll go back. figure $75-100 per person + drinks.   One small gripe - we made a reservation - they did not have it when we got there - they seated us the lounge, we had a drink and they gave us a great table w/in ten minutes, so -  no harm no foul. Also, the chairs are weird. Small and high design, but too low, so that I, at only 6ft tall, felt like I was squatting, legs kind of tucked under me, they should allow full leg extension but don't so I'll assume a small Asian or Itallian guy picked them.

I've been to Hana about 6 times, once at lunch and the rest always at dinner. Each time I have been there I have seen the place full and the diners mostly happy. On two of the occasions we came in with large tables, about 8 people. Frankly the place is a bit small for that, but they accommodated us cheerfully and took very good care of us. Our last visit, on Saturday about a week ago was with 8 people. When we arrived the place, including the sushi bar and patio, was full and they had two other 8 tops. We were seated in about 30 minutes (they don't take reservations but if you have a large party and call ahead they do their best) and were immediately given drinks. Our waitress VOLUNTEEERED to split the check (unheard of!) and did so perfectly into four and with great care. While we were waiting they took our wine and Sake and Chilled it for us and brought it out immediately after we were seated, even splitting the sake into warm and chilled carafes at their own suggestion. The food came out quickly despite the full house and was well received; about 6 of our guests that night were first timers. Every morsel of every dish was eaten and then we ordered more. I see other complaints about the salads and etc. in other reviews, I can't comment I have never eaten anything but sushi there and it has always been excellent, fresh and carefully prepared. My favorites: Dynamite Scallops, Tempura Roll, Spider Roll, Vegas Roll, Poki Chips, Caterpillar roll. It also cracks me up that they sometimes play MXC on the flat screen at the back of the restaurant. Also, the last two times we took 3 or four bottles of wine and were not charged a corkage fee, I assume that this was a courtesy as we spent a couple of hundred dollars on food, but it was appreciated and noticed.

Weak. We took a couple there for dinner recently for a special occasion. The service deteriorated through the meal which was OK at a few points even good. My main issue is the service. Our waitress was inattentive and another server stepped in a few times to fill drinks and provide for my unreasonable requests like a plate to eat the damn appetizers off. Before we finished our $230 meal they started sweeping, cleaning the kitchen, moving chairs and bar stools and generally making it clear they wanted us out before both severs sat down at the bar to eat their dinner and start texting. Taking the hint I suggested we leave and when I checked my watch I realized they were "open" for another 20 minutes plus. I live literally a block away but would rather drive to Richardsons or another place that does not rush you out on a Friday night.

We were very happy we came. Went for dinner  last Saturday at 9 pm at the very strong recommendation of a friend who is a chef.   I'd passed it for years and wondered if it was any good. I typically avoid Italian restaurants because they can't compete with what I and my friends can make at home.   We were seated immediately and greeted by the chef-owner (who I think got whacked on the last season of the Sopranos) who checked on us and other diners throughout the night and had three appetizers, all well prepared. My wine snob buddy found something he liked and the cocktails were good & strong.   Four of us dined and we were each very happy with our entrées which were "Sunday gravy", Joes Meatballs, Gnocchi in pesto and a fourth I can't remember. All but the famously large eater took food home from our large portions. Plenty of easy parking and a nice atmosphere with dark lighting in a simple, well maintained space. Dinner for 4 with 3 appetizers, a couple of cocktails, one bottle of wine and one huge slice of cheesecake was an affordable $200.00. Service was attentive and consistent, and the place seemed full of happy regulars. We will be back!

Went for lunch forth first time after several trips for dinner, all good. My lunch guests enjoyed their food and took home doggie bags. Both said they'd be back. Large portions avg. entrees were $9-15 and many of the dinner favorites were available in lunch proportions. The BIG news is that they also serve their pizza, which is take out only at night, at lunch!

The place is a bit unassuming in terms of the room, simple, light colors and large pics of Sinatra and his cohorts. Service is solid, portions are decent but up sells on small items, like a "side" of a 1/2 cup soggy spaghetti in meat sauce for $10 was silly, and mediocre at best. Like most places in Vegas these days they are not providing what you'd expect for the money. Passable, but not worth a special visit by any means. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the abundance of good, reasonably priced restaurants here in AZ. See my review of Aiellos in Phoenix - that was what I expected here - but did not get.

Great sushi in an odd and easy to miss location. Better than most places in town, reasonably priced and always consistent. Standouts include the crazy roll, baked scallop dynamite rolls and many of the others on both the extensive sushi menu and large Japanese Menu. I consistently to come here out of my way instead of the "fancier" places simply because their food is better.

I called Frenchy late and asked if he'd eaten and he said no. We picked a place that was close, a new joint on Camelback opposite Best Buy that used to be a hair Salon. He said it was a pizza place but that is not on my healthier new eating plan so he checked the menu and said they had lots of other choices and that if  it looked lame we could go somewhere else. I left the Esplanade and was there in two minutes and was pleased to pull into a BIG new parking lot with plenty of spaces and cars that clearly belong to people who are gainfully employed. Every new place in Phoenix seems to think that parking is optional.Get real, if we wanted that sh*t we'd move to Santa Monica. I like the freedom of having my vehicle and not getting on the light rail or any other b.s. on someone else's schedule.   There was a young guy in the parking lot attending to details and making sure the place was buttoned up. I asked him if I should actually go in and if the place was any good and he cheerfully said YES, with such enthusiasm that I marched right in. I was immediately surprised by the shaded patio which had cool tables, block walls and plants, and the surprise continued when I went in and found a cool, sleek simple space with good music and a lot of happy looking people working, eating and having a late Friday lunch. The service was good, two friendly people greeted me as I looked around to see if my friend was there yet, and I was immediately seated, given water and olives and provided a good fresh iced-tea. I sat at a large wood table in the window overlooking the cool patio and notice the other room had a large bar a bunch of high top tables that seemed to seat six. This was not what I expected when he said "pizza joint" it's way beyond that and very pleasant and open and light.  The menu was simple, a lot of great pizzas, half a dozen fancy salads, some sandwiches and about half a dozen app choices. They also had a good one page wine list that will be expanded and a COCKTAIL MENU AND FULL BAR!!!! Another rarity, FYI restaurant guys, beer and wine does not cut it for everyone. My buddy came in and was cheerfully pointed to me and when he sat down I could tell he was surprised as well, "This place looks pretty f*cking cool", were his exact words. I agreed and we ordered the Calamari appetizer, (had some specific name I don't remember) and I had a grilled chicken salad with tomatoes, blue cheese and candied walnuts and he had a sausage pizza with arugula and fresh sage, I think. All the food was great, I had the small salad and he had the small pizza and they were both well sized, we are both 6 foot and 200+ pounds and we were full. Eric came over and introduced himself and told us a little about the pace, his family's other restaurant (Nello's) and that they had only been open four days! For a brand new place they were doing great and if they maintain the service, food and great attitude I saw today it will be a once a week place for me. It's nice clean, casual but hip, would be a good place for a date or just lunch with a friend and brings a nice touch of a personal place to the Camelback corridor. Check it out and take a friend!

Great cocktails, comfort food, well trained staff. The Upward folks have four places nearly adjacent to each other  on central, all are packed and all are successful (Postino, Windsor, Joy Ride and Federal Pizza). Hallmarks of all are friendly staff, reasonable prices, consistent food and a fun, casual atmosphere with good music.

Great food in a small, loud restaurant and bar populated by neighborhood cougars and the men that love them, at least while they are there. As with any great steakhouse the side dishes  are the standout, at least for me (mac and cheese, spinach, mushrooms, whipped mashed potatoes etc) . Their seafood actually impressed more than the (very good) steaks and I've had halibut, tuna and the seafood tower there, all above average in quality, taste and value.  Heavy  wine list and strong cocktails lead to boisterous crowds. Severs are well trained and uniformly friendly based on at least 5 visits there. I'd go here over most comparable places in town, and PHX/Scottsdale has many high end steak places.

Called them Saturday 4/11 at around 11AM when I walked out my front door to find 1000 or so bees that were not there the night before swarming and apparently setting up their queen in a new home directly above the entrance to my home. By NOON Kevin had arrived, removed them and sealed the point of entry. Fast, friendly, courteous. Would use again.

Good fresh food in either ala carte of buffet format that is available for lunch most days. This was formerly known as Pete's Thai, which was excellent but which used a high spice level not all my friends enjoyed. Now you can use a seasoning bar with a dozen plus items to season to taste. They are friendly, trying hard and using all fresh ingredients they purchase daily or close to it. Definitely worth a try if you like traditional Thai food and really being able to taste all the many fresh herbs and spices in each dish.

Tried this place for the first time this week. Needed a break from the usual Biltmore corridor fare. Someone threw out the idea of bbq and this was closest.   Large place, lots of seating at booths or tables (seat yourself) clean, dark and casual. Sparsely decorated with no real theme or atmosphere and a couple of TVs playing quietly. You order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Meats come un-sauced and they have three or four different sauces at a central counter you help yourself to. Crowd was sparse and a mix of suits and uniforms  service was friendly and competent and they explained how to order since it was our first time.   My lunch mate had the pulled pork sandwich which is simply meat in a bun and a side of green chili Mac and cheese.   I had a two meat combo with brisket and tri-tip and the Mac on the side and ordered a slice of the gooey butter cake for us to share. Combo comes with Texas toast.   Pulled pork was excellent, smoky and well cooked. The brisket and tri-tip were ok, not horrible, not memorable and all my food, including the toast, was room temperature and dry. Mac and cheese are individual (not suitable for sharing as an FYI) a la carte portions and was tasty and heated through. Drinks are also self service and the ice tea was fresh and it appears they have beer, wine and cocktails. My lunchmate noted that the choices are "white" and "red" and are $9 a glass, cocktails are $7 and beers are $5, going on memory.   Combined this very simple meal was about $35.00+ and frankly for that much was not comparable to what you'd get for the same money at many other places in the area, for instance at OSHO a short distance away that serves really great hit and juicy pulled pork, brisket and pastrami sandwiches with good sides in a slightly nicer environment, or for that matter Hillstones at the Biltmore, where we could have eaten for a comparable cost.

First trip last week at lunch. Service gets an A, Food gets an A. The place was emptier than it should have been at lunch on a Friday, nearly all of us opted to sit on the patio facing Lincoln and Squaw Peak. Given how crowded and noisy many area places are at lunch, maybe that's a good thing but based on my experience they deserve to be busier. I never went inside as my guest was on the Patio when I arrived but the interior looked clean and modern from outside. Server was friendly and informative and we went with his recommendations on a special pizza and the appetizer of the day which was roasted purple cauliflower steak or heads, with a light cream sauce and crushed nuts. Both were delicious and came out very fast. They have a large selection of wines and a full bar as well. I'll be back!
