Staples moved across the street because their lease ended. They are now next to Ross.

I love coming to this place. Amazing pastries and food. The chef studied in France before coming here to open this place. Her fruit tarts are to die for. Gosh I keep dreaming about the fruit tarts.   Today I had the vegetarian quiche with a side of fruit. My new favorite here. Sorry I didn't take a pic of the quiche. I was hungry.

I came here almost a year ago but never wrote a review. This place serves hot, fresh food. They grow the food on the land behind the restaurant. It was so good that I went back multiple times to try different items on the menu. It's a bit of a drive from Tempe but I think it's worth the drive.

This place has awesome authentic Thai food. I spent 4 months in Phoenix and I found myself at Tasty Thai many many times for lunch and dinner. Thai fried rice was moist and full of flavor. Pad Thai was full of real authentic Thai flavor, spicy with a hint of lime. I'm Asian and I tried many different Asian and Thai restaurant in Phoenix. This place was the best.

Awesome tasting "flying saucer" sandwiches! Her desserts are diet killer! So good. The kale salad with the light dressing is full of flavor.

Quiet night, not a lot of patrons but it took them a while to even notice me. I walked in, no greeter present. Walked over to bar, no bartender present. Hmm should I go someplace else? I thought, since I'm already here, I might as well stay. Plus it's on the corporate card. So I stayed. Bartender finally shows up and takes my order. Didn't offer me a drink until I was about to pay my bill. Wow, there goes your tip. But in the end, I couldn't do it and since it's not my money, I still ended up leaving a 15% gratuity.

This is my third trip that I stayed at this place. I love the fact that it's new, just open in October 2013. First time  I stayed on the 8th floor, 2nd time was on the 9th and this time was on the 7th. I like my 9th floor room the best. Great view, low noise level. Maybe because of spring training the hotel seems a lot noisier this time. Lots of kids running around late at night.   The hotel is decorated with modern contemporary which fits my decorating style. I rather pay more for something than cheap on poor quality. The pool, gym, and patio lounge is on the 10th floor.  Roof top offers fantastic view of surrounding ASU campus. Breakfast is on the 1st floor in the morning, around the corner from the elevators. Don't eat the scramble eggs. I don't know how most people eat scramble eggs but I don't like scramble eggs to taste like watery rubber. I usually get some yogurt, some fresh fruit (if it looks fresh), cup of OJ, and a piece of toast.   I will definitely stay here again until this place starts to deteriorate. With ASU campus around the corner, the late night drunk college kids regurgitating their evening drinks is a common scene. The plus side is the eye candy around the ASU campus. Food around this area is geared towards college lifestyle. Have to travel north towards Scottsdale for quality food.

Service was great for happy hour but the sashimi did not taste that fresh. It might have been because I was starving, but I felt sick eating the sushi. I love sashimi, sushi but tonight's didn't taste good. The rolls were over stuff with rice and very little sushi.   Carlee was actually a fantastic host tonight. Maybe she was having a bad night the other night per another reviewer.

Nice brand new store that looks immaculately clean. Shelves are stocked full of products. Staff is very friendly and wants to help.
