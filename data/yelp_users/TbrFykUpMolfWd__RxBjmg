Even a non veggo can come to Green and enjoy one of their many authentic  vegan friendly meals.   Whether you're looking for a healthy bite with some friends or just grabbing a  tSoynami as a treat, you'll leave green with a smile on your face. I usually combine a mix of pretzels, chocolate, caramel & marshmallow but the choices are infinite. use your imagination and create something to suit your taste bud needs.  I must admit, i dont fancy their eco friendly recycled utensils. I feel as though they leave that cardboard flavored taste in your mouth that i've never seemed to enjoy much. Then again, it's a price im willing to pay to go GREEN.   The vegan chocolate peanut butter bars found by the register are a delicious treat to take on the go. I've always wanted to get one of the many psychedelic coloring books provided by local artists but at  around $20.00 cost, I've yet to splurge my student income. I suggest checking this place out. Whether you need a quick feed after yoga, a snack on the run, or even take-out for dinner, Greens the place to go.  There are always positive vibes flowing and the helpful employees make it an enjoyable atmosphere to kick back and relax.

Being a Jersey girl, I still can't grasp the fact that I need to get on the highway for chinese food but it's worth the journey.   This has been the go to take out chinese food spot on xmas eve for years now but I've never been inside till last night. It's got a great atmosphere and the best chinese in town!   Though i'm not a vego, chicken from restaurants usually freaks me out. For some reason I still went for two chicken dishes & I'll be real with you, they were both legit.   My freshman year roommate, Roxy- a brooklynite even munched both dishes and gives it two thumbs up as well.    GO TO DISHES: MUSHU CHICKEN (ASK FOR EXTRA SAUCE FOR SURE)  CHICKEN LOMEIN   If i could change one thing, it would be the NY egg rolls. If they were really NY egg rolls, they'd take the jews in consideration and have a non shellfish option here!

One of my first memories here was many years back when I was still a youngin. My brother,  Jared M. took me here for some dinner. We ordered a pizza and continued to play boggle and hang out..a memory I'll never forget.   So here are some of my favs;  pizza's always delicious but when you can breakfast all day, the commuter is my number one pick. Mixing the tea's is definitely a good move to make & they've e also got amazing pre-made salads for the ones who need something quick and on the go. Most recently i had  a delicious turkey sandwich & a burger with my roommate to share. Although they forgot the burger, the free cookies they let us eat after made it all worth the while.  Too bad I was too full to hit the gelato spot attached to the dining area but then again, there's always next time!!   Though parking is often a b***h you'll lose any sense of anger after walking inside their doors. The workers are friendly and the music sets tone for great times.   GO GO GO TO LGO even if your getting your food to go, they'll bring it straight to your car, uber convenient eh?

Loved having dinner up on the 51 floor last night. Amazing view of the palms sign on the tower adjacent to ours. The wait staff was friendly, helpful, and there to please.   I was with my friend Kim and they sat the two of us in a booth, I obviously scooted myself to the middle and sat next to her.   We ordered the veggie pizza and penne vodka. When we got the penne with shrimp the waiter was very understanding of my allergy and swapped the dish out for penne with chicken. The pasta in this dish was so good. Ridiculous quality , seriously two thumbs up!   Couldn't tell you which wine I had specifically but it was the only cab by the glass and I liked it.. Even though it was chilled.   Next time id like to head to the playboy club post dinner.

After four years of college and limited breakfast spots around, I finally got my butt over to essence bakery before 10 am for some grub. I won't lie to you, I expected a lot more. I got the big breakfast which wasn't big at all and was thrown off from their limited selection. Maybe next time I'll try lunch or some baked goods instead but trust me, NO NEED TO WAKE UP EARLY FOR THIS BREAKFAST SPOT. If you're really keen though, they serve breakfast all day on the weekends!

Who knew this place even existed?   I was feeling quite sick and couldn't decide what would satisfy my soul when my roommate suggested we get some soup. Little did I know what a cool scene I was walking into or I would have probably changed out of my pajamas. In reality, NO ONE CARED about my attire, the lighting was dark and the seating was said to be from an old mine however it reminded me more of a church.  The people that work here are super chill, they were playing AC/DC's, "Let there be Rock" and the pasty's reminded me of an Australian pie.   The soup was fabulous and they give you tons of bread which is delicious to dip or butter! They've got pasties on pasties on pasties to pick from as well. I decided on the vegan eggplant parmesan and although I was under the impression I specifically asked for no cheese, vegan or not, I received it. Hey, mistakes happen it was what it was and I wouldn't order that again but even if I wasn't going to eat, its a low key hipster bar scene for sure, and i'm all about that.

Been here a few times with frat boys but I never catch a good night. I mean hey, I obviously make the best of it and enjoy myself but it's never quite as packed as I'd hope it to be. Usually I find myself looking around and knowing everyone in the room which isn't what you're always looking for on a night out.   It's a pleasure getting into Jackrabbit when you're with the right people and the bouncers have always treated me well.   I remember going there last year after the Lupe Fiasco concert on a Thursday for my birthday and the bartender gave me a free drink.. or two ;)  The music's great and I've even been on stage shaking my booty here and there.   Though I doubt you'll be checking out the decor of the place next time your there, do check the wall paper its cheesy but cool!

In the word's of Spongebob Square Pants, "I'M READY!" After ten months of more Mcdonald's than I've probably eaten in the past ten years, I'm ready to leave Australia and return to my home country, the meca of fast food.   Though, I am an avid fan of the New American cuisine (vegan friendly & fair trade) I WANT SOME MEAT. I've made a list of all the fast food spots I plan on hitting up upon arrival back to the states.   This list reads as follows:   1. In N Out 2. Whataburger 3. Wendy's 4. Taco Bell   As you can see, In N Out's my number one and this is simply because it's the best. It's funny to see that Mickey D's isn't even on the list when I shamefully admit that my roommates and I eat there maybe once or twice a week.. gross, I know.   Last night over a double hamburger, fries, and a sundae all for 9 dollars, I began explaining In N Out to my house mate. In N Out isn't a place you go for just anything, most people know exactly what they like and order just that, time and time again.   Though the menu is small and simple the big tastes explain it all. The patty's aren't large in any way but the fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion combined make their burgers hard to get a proper bite in your mouth all at once.   I'm not the biggest fan of the fries so I usually opt away from them and snag a couple of my friends though I have come to In N Out alone before (which is not pathetic on any level). So yeah, like I said I get the same thing every time switching back and forth between their delicious lemonade and milkshakes. The good thing about this location is the Yogurtland in the lot right next door. So if you ever see me around the Grigio, dont be surprised if I head over for some dessert after my 'gourmet meal'.  Note for vegetarians: If you're a vego you can order off the secret special menu. This menu is not spoken about, kinda like that guy on Harry Potter who's name shouldn't be said out loud. If you know about the menu and order it theres no problem but there's no chance you're getting an employee to tell you about it! Sorry, I won't be sharing their secrets here but if you're interested definitely look up their secrets online!  Since I've been living in Australia, I've realized how condiments aren't that big over here and find it frustrating how they charge you 50 cents for dipping sauce. Sometimes I can't be bothered spending extra on sauce since even Macca's is an expensive meal but baby do I love me some sauce. In N Out's, Special Sauce is so delicious and definitely worth the extra money for a packet. Though its probably just a mixture of mayo and ketchup (kinda like big mac sauce) it's an essential add on.   This is fast food but you shouldn't expect it to be quick and easy. Every time I go to In N Out, there's a drive thru line through the parking lot. Thankfully, they've got employees who wear goofy outfits standing outside with Ipads sending your order in when the drive thru is like this.  I understand I may have gotten peoples hopes up but I suggest going into your first In N Out experience with low expectations. I was honestly so dissapointed after my first try at an In N Out near LAX maybe Arizona's In N Out's are just better? I think I had just gotten my own hopes up but whatever the reason was for it to be so bad, I swear after my second try I became addicted.

When you walk into the small door from outside your world is transformed into coffee heaven. Although I always grab a cold one on the way out, it's always nice to get some frothy espresso and enjoy a game of scrabble sometimes.  A great spot to grab a coffee off campus and to steal some time for yourself. Secretly hidden, The best way to start a hot day is with an ice cold Toddy (extremely strong iced coffee) it's got an acquired taste but it'll have you up and running in no time. Cartel's Coffee is very strong. First time I ordered a shot of espresso I even had to chase it down, definitely worth a try!!  Their addition of the Ipad in the ordering process has helped speed up order time & looks pretty cool too. So, if your in a rush grab one for on the go & if you've got some time sit down for the day. Either way, one step into  Cartel Coffee Lab awakens you. My favorite coffee joint in Tempe for sure and perfectly hidden from the close noise of ASU's Tempe campus.

good vibes & good climbs. Took me long enough to get here but i'm sure i'll be back! Last week I finally made it to AZ on the Rocks with a childhood friend. I've got some trust issues so I'm all about the boulders. There are so many different options for less advanced to advanced climbers and tons of boulder space which is nice! The staff was way friendly and the membership deal is worth looking into for sure! I think that next time I'll probably just join but hey, if you go and sign up on the day of your climb, they take your daily climbing fee off of the membership payment on the spot.. if this is confusing, just go in and ask the staff for yourself, TRUST ME it's worth it ;)

ALERT: DOUCHE BAG CENTRAL!! Like most of the people here looking to: hit it & quit it... I hit this place up  and I doubt I'll be going back. There are too many people in too small of a space so don't bother if you're not down to "get down"

I can't believe this place closed! I was so excited to write a review and use my new favorite word, "douschebaggery" when explaining the scene. Oh, this place was so seedy. Tons of guidos and I swear they LOVED to wear all white.  If I could, I would have given this place zero stars.   I guess I'm happy they closed down because it was a long time coming. This place was so over the top. The process of getting in was always annoying. You'd HAVE to valet your car and then upon entry there would be way too many people bombarding you in the entry way.   The location's a bit off the main strip of clubs in Scottsdale and I always found it weird to be on Drinkwater when I'd go out to the patio section.   Anyway, I'm just crossing my fingers now that who ever buys the property gut the inside and make into some trendy hipster bar/lounge!!

Mmmm surprised I haven't reviewed this yet but they've got pretty amazing pastries. It must have been over a year ago when I came in with my friend Roxy and enjoyed a strawberry crumble.   Just last Friday I returned to meet my friend Cole and his mom. They were sharing a mocha, espresso, and almond milk so I followed their lead and couldn't have been happier. This was real strong and I'm definitely happy I got a small especially since it costs almost five dollars!!!   They've got a back door area as well and good ambiance too but as per the usual downtown, parking is quite the hassle.

This is the perfect spot to find mid 1940's to 1970's furniture. After a full day of antiquing with Cole, we parked around the corner and made our way towards the vintage Volks Wagon. Of course this was what lurred me in from the start seeing as I'm car shopping and would love nothing more than to buy one of these bad boys and make my way from coast to coast.   Though this spot is hidden, its a true treasure as are all of the pieces you'll find inside.    The coffee tables, chairs, and sofas were some of our favorites but I also recommend checking out the lighting as well.   Our search for a wooden step ladder continues but my heart has found a home. Plan is to save up and be back as soon as we can afford some new pieces for the loft.

i love everything about this place except its location.  I got into it last summer when my boss introduced me to the thai wrap. As of recently I began getting the thai bowl though and I always get the pasta salad as my side, ALWAYS!  I love the outdoor patio area, the staff is nice & they do a 6 dollar lunch special.   They also have date night, you'll need to double check but I believe its M&T 20 dollar for two meals and a drink.. definitely something to look into.   My suggestions: Arcadia location & breakfast wraps :)

This place is life changing. Get into the cycle of regularly attending yoga and you'll feel like a goddess. Just be sure not to get too caught up in the yoga gear when you walk in because this place is pricey.   This is a good investment for people of all ages. Anton Mackey can get you flowing through the yoga moves in no time. With a combination of; Vinyasa Flow style yoga, some heat, and hip-hop / electronic up beat tunes everyone is sure to be sweating at the end of this 90 minute class.  No matter how much I get to Life Power, I'm always sore the next day. The heat helps you open up and push yourself like you havent ever before. I give this place two thumbs up.   In addition to yoga classes they have an area dedicated to cardio as well as a personal training station with pilates reformers and more. . .  It took me too long to get to LIfe Power and no ones stopping you, so GO because I've yet to find anywhere like it. Find it within yourself and get to Life Power, you're sure to fall in love with life.

This awesome café is located under one of the biggest apartment complexes at Arizona State Universities, Tempe Campus.    Whether you sit down on a comfy couch or wait at home on your own couch for the cute delivery boy to arrive, the hipster staff provides great eye candy. The new late night $5 dollar sandwiches were my go to snack when I lived on Apache Blvd.   I've enjoyed breakfast burritos after a long night, coffee with a bacon egg & cheese while walking to school, and have even brought my mom in for a late lunch.   My favorite is to find a friend and split The Summer Salad (spinach, almonds, strawberries, feta, & some balsamic) along with any of their Signature Sandwiches. Providing the best of the best Boars Head Turkey (an East Coast girls dream) I always find myself deciding between the Turkey, Bacon, Pesto Sandwich or the Traditional Club Sandwich. Either one is a sure hit and you can't go wrong with these delicious deli meats.  From shots of espresso to strawberry smoothies, their drink options provide for everyones needs.  Coffee lovers don't forget to grab a BROSENbRUS stamp card since we all love free coffee!!  All in all, BROSENbRUS' super laid back atmosphere calls for a good time and a good meal. BROSENbRUS' cafe is trendy yet casual and fun. It's great for a quick bite or even a cold drink when you need to get out of the sun. Stop in when you have a chance, they'll be waiting for you!

yum in my tum. couldnt have been happier to enjoy brunch here today on christmas. not only was everyone welcoming and the service was great but the food was delic.   come here to satisfy your israeli food needs but know, it is a milk & dairy only environment.   Paprika, the restaurant next door can prepare meat dishes though and outside seating makes it easy to enjoy a meal between the two restaurants.

While you can find some of my favorites added to my post for Green I just tried an affogoto and I am hooked. I LOVE straight espresso so found myself eating spoon fulls of it straight but by the time i got to the bottom of my cup all that was left was tons of syrup. Next time I'll mix it all up and make myself a vegan flurry for sure.   My friend Mariah works in here, if you see her or any of the staff you'll be greeted with a smile and the owners the man too.   Definitely come in here for some vegan deliciousness but be ready for the post soy gas as well.   Suggestions include peanutbutter chocolate bars, peanut butter frosted banana muffins, tsoynamis, and as stated above AFFOGOTOS!   Oh one more tip, if you like chai get their desert haboob ;)

This place is pretty legit. I'm living in the high rises around the corner and finally stopped in. I got a breakfast burrito that was nearly perfect (minus the avocado I wanted that was not available) It's a quaint little joint with a chef and a server which is nice but be ready for some oil for sure. also, 8 dollars for a breakfast burrito's WAY EXPENSIVE but hey, they are on mill and can pull it off  TIP: NOW OPEN 12am -3am for burritos  #clutch

LOVE ME SOME ACAI!   Thrive has got a great little store front with catchy slogans and what not. The menu is awesome and I definitely suggest the green bowl.   I'm not sure how I feel about the set up with the kitchen in the back and all but I'll forgive them for taking so long on an acai bowl because it was really really good.   I may try the gluten free granola next time because whatever they use regularly is quite light and crunchy. I also think they should potentially get vita-mix's or industrial type blenders rather than the little bullets I saw them using. I had a huge chunk of acai  on the bottom of my bowl & it just seems like blenders would be more useful honestly.

ALL BODIES RISE :)   such a pleasant surprise ending up here on a monday at 12 pm for yoga class.  My girl Janell & I had planned on going to class last minute around 11:45 and stumbled in right in time.   At first we were nervous the class was going to be very very basic but we both found ourselves sweating as we remained in each pose for a solid amount of time.   After a great flow, I know I'll return.

Okay so I have to admit I was originally extremely unimpressed. My brother brought home the chopped salad as well as the caesar and some pancakes over the weekend and they were alright but I expected more.   The cucumber and pickled onion side salad is delicious but messy people beware! This is a messy persons worst night mare and upon ordering you are asking to just ruin a piece of your clothing.. Still worth it though!   Anyways I got in to the cafe today with Cole and we shared the del real sandwich with a cinnamon role. The sandwich will definitely be my go to from here on out. No complaints on the cinnamon role either. They heat the pre made pastry up and top it with cream cheese frosting, yum!   Definitely go in soon and redeem your free cookie but tip: stay away from double chocolate and stick to the vegan peanut banana !

So happy I finally got myself to Nekter.   On Monday, I carpooled to yoga up at Gainey and on our way back home we stopped in for some bowls to go. I had the PB bowl - PERFECT for the chocolate lover.   On Tuesday, I drove my niece and nephew to school with my brother. After drop off, he wanted a bagel which was when I suggested Nekter take 2.  This time, I got the cleansing juice (can't remember the name) but it was great minus the parsley. I definitely became accustom to the flavor but I think I would sub it out if ordered that again. My brother got the same juice along with the berry acai bowl which he devoured.   Now, its Wednesday (7:27 am) and Nekter is on my mind again! Just found out they do $3 juices for babies. I heard the flamingo is good.   So, clearly I am hooked and hope others hop on the band wagon too!  The prices are the most reasonable for healthy fresh breakfast bowls, smoothies, & juices in town FOR SURE.  For the first time in four years, I finally have somewhere to be in Hilton Village. I guess I wouldn't mind driving my brothers kids to school more often if it means being close by to Nekter. But wait, I also heard they may be opening a new location on 44th & Indian School :)   That's my scoop. Go check it out. I love the atmosphere, vibe, ambiance, decor & they do juice cleanses as well!
