Walked in a few minutes after 5:00 and after a minute of awkwardly standing in the lobby the girl behind the counter looked up from her phone, curtly said "hi" I asked get if anybody could take a look at my check engine light, which she then responded with "we don't take in cars past 5:00. You can leave it overnight and we'll look at it in the morning. It's $70 to do a diagnosis." And that's it. Zero customer service.

This location always has the best customer service! Rather than trying to up-sell you, they always try to save you money. Definitely a pleasure to work with in the most stressful of situations. Thanks guys!

Highly disappointed with my visit to High Noon yesterday; very overpriced and tattoo artist didn't even remember the color of ink I wanted to use.   Me and my roommate had decided to get tiny wrist tattoos in the morning so I went on Yelp and found High Noon and felt confident going in considering all their 5 star reviews but man, I wish I would have gone somewhere else. First of all, they are cash only which is super annoying being that it's 2016 and all. The staff wasn't very friendly when we came in so that was a bummer too. Next Kitt (our tattoo artist) starts drawing out the tattoos and mine was smaller than I wanted so I asked if I could make it bigger but you could tell that he was annoyed that I asked. He starts to set everything up and we run out to pull out some cash really fast and when he gets back we head to the back. I notice the ink is black when I had asked for red but I thought that maybe it was for my friend since hers was black, but nope, he used the black ink on me and it was too late to say anything once he started. The tattoo itself was a semicolon that was smaller than a dime...it literally took him like 3 minutes to do and he even made a joke about it being the quickest tattoo ever! I let the ink slide because the black looked fine, it just wasn't what I wanted but then I go to pay and my total is $60...for a THREE MINUTE TATTOO. My roommates was four times as big and had more detail and was the same price. Wtf? I guess the rate for a tattoo is $20 a minute now. Yikes. It also didn't seem super clean like other establishments I've been to. Definitely would not recommend this shop to anyone. I should have been patient and just waited for an opening at Golden Rule Tattoo, where I got my half sleeve for a reasonable rate and the staff was much more personable! Super bummed with my experience.

I went to the Destroyer concert on September 21st (forgot to finish my review that night =P) and the entire place smelled of paint thinner (or something else similarly awful). They didn't have fans or open doors or anything else to try to neutralize the odor. After feeling sick from an hour of being there I had to step out to get some fresh air but then came back in as the headliner was starting their set. After an hour and a half long set my head was KILLING me. The performance was great but I don't know if it was worth the migraine and upset stomach.

After searching and searching for an auto repair shop that was open past 5:00pm in my area and being turned down by a couple of shops I was about to give hope but then I came across Anyplace Auto Repair and left a voice mail seeing if it was possible to have my check engine light looked at as I had registration and emissions due in a few days. Carter called me back within 10 minutes and talked to me for about 5 min about what the problem could be. It was already later in the day but he said he could stop by on his way home and take a look at it. He got there, fixed the problem in 30 minutes and my check engine light hasn't come on since! I passed emissions with flying colors and saved a lot of time and a TON of money compared to all the other crooks that call themselves auto repair shops. Would highly recommend to any friend or family member! Thanks Carter!!

My boyfriend and I stumbled across 24 Carrots this past weekend while in Tempe and thank God we did because this place is amazing! The restaurant itself is super cute but their extensive menus are the best part! Sasha, the owner, came over to our table to introduce herself and was hands down one of the sweetest, most passionate people I have ever met. I just.wish I lived closer to this restaurant so I could visit more often!

Literally the fucking worst experience ever. I really REALLY wish I would have done more research before choosing to go with Golden Eagle Moving Company! First off, the customer service over the phone is little to none, they clearly give zero shits. Next, they forgot our pickup time and call me an hour after they were supposed to be at our house and say "we just noticed on the invoice that the pickup time was 11:00, do you still want us to pickup your stuff?" Uhh, no shit, what else am I supposed to do with all this stuff?! When they finally get there (3 hours late) they try to up-sell my roommate on shrink wrap when literally nothing we were moving needed to be shrink wrapped; she then asks if they would compensate anything for being so late in which they then waive the shrink wrap fee. Next they go to my house to pick up my stuff, once they see that I have a TV they then tell me that there is a $25 TV moving fee since they already packed one TV from my roommates house. Seriously?! My TV is barely bigger than a computer monitor and can be easily lifted by one person. Anyway, so they finally head to our new house and once they get there they request cash payment before they can unpack the truck. Okay, sure I guess? He then gives me the total which was $200 more then they quoted me over the phone (and the quote given was an extreme time frame and was told it would likely be lower) so obviously upset at this point I asked him why it was so high when we were told a much lower amount, he then told me it was for (x) amount of time from pickup to arrival of the house, I then told him that they didn't arrive until 3 hours after the original pickup time and that he wasn't going off the actual arrival time which he then with "oh yeah" and recalculates the total. It still ended up being $140 more than quoted. Cool. I then tell him that since my roommate wasn't at the house yet and I did not have the full amount on me that they would have to wait until she got there for me to run to the bank. They tell me that they will unload half of the truck with the amount of cash that I had on me as a deposit. As they are bringing the items in the house one of the movers drops a framed art print and the glass shatters (picture shown); he then comes out of the hallway where it was dropped and simply says "one of these broke, there's glass here," no apology whatsoever. Wow, super professional. They are almost done unloading the truck and hit a point where they need the rest of the money to finish up. My roommate is still not home but tells me that she is about 20 min away which one of the movers responded "she can't get here faster?" Umm, you guys were 3 hours late and you are the one sassing us? Cool. When she gets there I confirm the cost owed and see if I can get the TV fee waived instead of the shrink wrap fee since they didn't wrap anything to begin with. He tells me no because "the invoice has already been written and once it is written we cannot change it." I then ask him what about the glass that they broke, shouldn't you reduce the final amount to accommodate the glass I'm now going to have to replace? He tells me that I can write that in on the invoice and someone will contact me to set up my claim. Wait, didn't you tell me that once the invoice was written you couldn't go back and adjust it? Ok whatever. I get the rest of the money and they finish unloading. They looked disappointed when we didn't give them a tip at the end but good God, why in the hell would we tip after such a shitty experience?! The thing that was most frustrating about this is I could have gone with a really reputable company that had wonderful customer service and great reviews but had turned them down because they were more expensive than I wanted to spend. In the end they were only $15 more expensive than what we ended up paying with Golden Eagle. Also, two weeks later and no one from the company has contacted me about the broken glass claim. Awesome.  Ugh - DO NOT go with this company!
