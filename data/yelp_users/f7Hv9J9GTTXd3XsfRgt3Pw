I've been a customer here for several years.  Fantastic shopping option versus PetsMart, PetCo, Pet Club, or any of the other pet store options where you get riipp,er......to leave with empty pockets.  Granted you can NOT purchase pet food here, I don't believe they have cat litter, and they don't sell Pinkees either,  but treats are available and the selection is fairly good.  Pet shampoos, tools of various types for trimming nails, leashes, collars, harnesses (do you really know what a harness is for?), tons of great toys for destuffing, chasing, snuggling, or gifting.  Stimulation games too.  Urns for your beloved pets cremains that come in various sizes. Did I mention nutritional supplements?  Books on grooming.  Oh yeah, and grooming tables, tubs, and all of those ridiculous accessories (bows, nail polish, hair color -OMG, just makes me RME) for those froo froo doggies. Hey, I'm sorry, but that's just not my thing.  Their price on crates will cause you to roll your eyes at what people on craigslist charge for a used crate.  And if you already purchased a crate from, say PetsMart, well you'll probably choke on the thought of what you paid and, --oh well I suppose that's enough.  Now before your eyes glaze over from the joy of saving some bucks AND getting lots of great things for your heart dog -or cat, be aware that this is a WAREHOUSE.  There really isn't customer service here folks.  If you found this place, drove here, and have money to spend on your pet I really want to believe you can at least try to find what you're looking for.  If not, there are employees wandering around, stocking shelves, filling orders, pulling merchandise, etc. and they are always willing to direct you to where a product would be and if needed, help you get it off the shelf, to the register to pay, and then loaded into your car.  This is not a place to bring snookums to pick out a toy, but you can bring your pet with you to shop.  Just be aware there may be others with pets and not all are friendly, so listen to your pet and do NOT play that card "snookums wants to say HI! to your dog" cuz it's just not cool and you really don't want to embarrass your pet.  Last thing.  You are not allowed to carry anything into the warehouse.  No backpacks, purses, nada.  I suspect it's just easier to prevent products from accidentally slipping into these such things.  Now go buy your puppers a big fluffy stuffy, a pig ear or some other Red Barn snack, and they'll be so happy you finally stopped by here.

Location isn't easy to find if you're not familiar with the area.  Just be aware. Parking lot has limited spaces on one side but there's more on the gravel side.  There's also at least one huge pothole too, see keep your eyes peeled. Service is polite and helpful. Salsa has a nice bite and tortilla chips taste like they're made in house. Margaritas are perfectly potent. I came for the Groupon Tamale Class for two and was very pleased.  If you like tamales a d have ever wanted to make some yourself I suggest you jump on board.   Elizabeth was a great teacher.  Polite, detailed, offered assistance where needed and provided enough instruction that gave us confidence to move on at a good pace and practically leave the others sinking deep in their masa.   The masa smelled so good and once we added the sauce the meat was in it just upped it 5 more notches.  We, my friend and myself, we're having a good time.  Some others were sporting the face of a sour puss and seemed to disapprove of the fun time we were having.  What is up with that?!  We actually thought there would be some light hearted chat in between sipping Margaritas and making our tasty creations, but the majority of the evening we saw glares from a couple people across the room. Must have been cause I wanted a double shot in my Margarita after getting off of i10, a mere 1.7 miles away and it took us more than a half hour.  I was only half kidding. Overall it was a positive experience, the lesson was informative and our instructor made it very easy to follow along. I enjoyed it so much that I'd be game to do it again.  Would be a great tram building experience.  I even suggested she offer similar classes through cities nearby. And fwiw, for what homemade tamales cost me just a few weeks ago this class would be a bargain without Groupon. I took almost 2 dozen Beef tamales home.  And we even got a warm Churro as a thank you for for participating.   I don't think I've actually ordered a Churro before.  Nom nom -love me some cinnamon.

I've been coming here since 1997.  It was then that I decided this was the right place for my animals.  Dr. Weaver was gentle with my dogs, open to treating naturally and even offered suggestions for natural items that might prove beneficial in healing of wounds.  Since Dr. Weavers retirement I've continued coming to this practice and have been able to work closely with Dr. M. Ferrera, Dr. E. Clinton,  an Dr. Agnew to care for my beastlies   I WISH they would get equipment necessary to run same day progesterone and how about some U/S equip while I'm wishing. I WISH I didn't have to battle with Starbucks for parking.  They monopolize the parking lot.  GRRR. But in closing, Cindy is the greatest, but don't call and ask for her.  LOL!!  Seriously, the staff ROCKS.

Walking out of this place with my face buried in two large plants of (Amethyst and Pesto Perpetuo) Basil.  Life is good. No need to smoke this stuff  -feel like I'm in heaven just inhaling the fresh, live bouquets fragrance. Okay, let's get down to business. If you're serious about gardening, you care about the earth, want organic and heirloom, to reduce chemical use, be offered guidance, and more -this is THE place to start. Staff is helpful, knowledgable, and have the resources if there is any doubt. They have fruit trees from Dave Wilson Nursery.  That is a huge plus cuz planting trees that will survive AND produce is the goal. They plant from seed some of the stuff and some gets shipped in.   And if you have chickens I recently learned that the organic feed can be picked up here too.   I wish they had gardening classes or simply a schedule of dates in which they set up and plant their display gardens.  They are lovely to gave at and the production I've seen has been impressive. So in case you didn't figures this out yet, I really do LOVE this place. Of course I'm a DBG member and probably a future volunteer there so I guess that helps explain it.

A fine Mom & Pop Polish Deli in a neighborhood strip mall with nice selection of deli meats you're not going to find at many other delis and certainly not at any grocery stores. Sandwiches are hearty and satisfyingly good -and would make a great start for a picnic for two.  Get a salad, fruit and a bottle of wine and you're good to go. Oh, don't forget the date. They have assorted cookies/biscuits, candies, pasta, and beverages in the store too.  Important note for some, this place is CASH only. I suppose that keeps the cost down.  I'm really enjoying the Garlic Loin I picked up.  Would make yummy sandwiches but I'm snacking on it plain.   Whoever thought of Pork Tenderloin as a deli meat.  MMMmm.  Lean and flavorful but not overpowering. You can pass on the Ham and no need for Turkey cuz Pork IS the "other white meat" ya know.  If you're in the area and have a thing for Deli, give 'em a try. This is supporting the area economy in a good way.  Good for your belly and good for business.

Great selection of fresh produce. Choice of conventional or organic and the occasional heirloom variety. Helpful staff.  Good prices too. You need to sign up if you want the heads up, or hook up with someone who's already on the list and split cases.  You can also pick up individual items that are priced on the box. If you plan to do all your produce shopping here you need to remember to bring a bag, basket, cooler or something to carry it in as you select from the options available.  The staff will grab a case for you and put it aside so you don't have to worry about carrying that around.  Just remember, you need to check the contents of the case before you pay and leave or you actually could be getting bad produce.  Things spoil.  It just happens.  This is the place that supplies Bountiful Baskets so it's all the same stuff you see in the weekly baskets -conventional or organic. And as someone else had mentioned you can get on board for Bountiful Baskets at this location.  Parking is limited to one lot and it actually does fill up.  Most transactions are fairly quick so be patient if you can't find a parking spot ASAyouarrive.

Okay, I haven't been here in years and had been wanting to check out the area "stockyards" again since.  So Arizona Restaurant Week had them on their list and I thought, 'what better reason is there to go than this?" Maybe it was the option I chose but I wasn't very impressed.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good but I was hoping for something more like the meal I've had at the Silver Spur in Tucson (OMG -Gooooooood stuff).  My prime rib was a small portion and seemed to have a lot more fat than mere marbeling.  The sweet potatoes were okay but heck, just leave 'em in the skin and serve 'em if you're not going to make them something special. Cornbread and Baking Powder Biscuits served before the meal were fine, but I make better cornbread right out of the box.  And what do they mix in the butter that created red looking drips?  Honey? I liked the crudites - cukes, jicama, celery, carrots, black olives.  My son, who happens to be a good eater, ordered the rack of ribs and hardly got through half the rack.  He said he was hungry but apparently didn't like the flavor. And he was about as impressed with the sweet potatoes as I was.  Desert was alright. Brownies a al mode for myself and son and hubby had the shortcake.  The special online menu that I viewed said it was mixed berries but the server said strawberry -that's what he got, strawberry.  It was all fine but I just felt that being one of the restaurants on the Arizona Restaurant Week meant those businesses were out to impress. I just wasn't impressed.  I love steak but about the only time I order it when I'm out is when we're at a steakhouse.    Love the decor and the history of the place.  Service was fine -except when I asked for a couple of biscuits to be thrown in with my leftovers.  That didn't happen.

I've always had great food and good service here. Sushi bar, table, or teppan, it's all good. Items are very fresh and all have been tempting.  Something I have noticed here is that when you sit at the bar they have never given us something to sample.  Hmmm.  Maybe it's just my fading memory. But overall, this place is my fave.

Prompt seating by hostess, two servers (?!) -Cass and Cassie, but haven't seen her yet.  Meals options look good, and they're CHEAP.  I figure it must be small portions so we will see.   Place is busy and the volume level is up there but that could be because there is no obvious music playing. Meals arrived promptly after ordering, portions were fair size too. Service was good but the idea of having two servers is unusual, especially when you only see the same one.  Overall it was a good experience.  Not a long wait. Plenty of yummy menu items to decide from. Efficient service.

Appointment at 130 for paperwork, evaluation for repair that needed to be done, work started immediately upon my approval.  I'm out of the chair before 5 p.m. with a crown, not a temp either.  Jann had an ease in her technique.   Dr. Faran was pleasant and charming. Today is my last day until next year.  I've had a root canal & crown, a cleaning, and another crown since the first appointment.  Yes it had been a while.  Glad to have found a dental office that's relaxed, mostly on schedule, and they don't give me the impression that they're trying to sell me on something more than what is needed. My son also comes to this office and says they are much more gentle than what he dealt with at the pediatric dental office.  So what does that tell ya?

Same Regency Cleaners staff and locations,  just new business name, ownership with more focus placed on a more environment friendly product and more current style.  No price changes.  Great chance to catch up with manager to get an idea whats going on, how the change affects us as customers, and get the low down on the product used.  Hoping to see an improvement from previous ownership.  I know the staff makes great efforts to provide customer care and service.  In the past I watched some good employees walk away and I am certain it was because of upper management aka previous owners.

Sunday almost 3 pm and it took just over three (3) minutes to get two corndogs, large tater tots, and two large fresh fruit slushes. Service was efficient and young lady was polite too. Nothing like I had anticipated after reading other reviews.  So hurray for that.

This place has been here for several years and I popped in one time after a visit from my dentist.  That first visit had me sold and it wasn't long afterwards that I was talking about the place while visiting my dental office and telling  them how good it is.  Well to my surprise not one of the people that worked in the office had ever had a taste of Nielsen's Frozen Custard.  *gasp* Could this be true?! I mean how is it possible?  This place is not even a quarter mile from their office. So I brought in several varieties prior to a follow up visit and the staff was thanking me profusely.  REAL frozen custard.  It is delicious, has flavor you can truly taste and real substance that doesn't wimp out immediately when exposed to the AZ weather.   I've had Freddy's and Carver's and although theirs is tasty there is something about the recipe that just falls short of Nielsens. And that Rita's place, c'mon.  The staff there uses a mix and couldn't even tell you the difference between ice cream and frozen custard.   And someone was telling me I need to try it, it's good.   When I indulge in something that is going to pad my hips and thighs I prefer authentically delicious, not false a representation.

Good flavor sauce. Pulled Pork is sad. It's excessively moist, like water was added to increase volume/weight. The taste of the pork alone was unimpressive. The "Hot" sauce doesn't even have a bit of nip of fire. So many other barbecue places in the Valley that have flavorful meats and sauces.

Server was not efficient and didn't seem to have a clue.   I ordered a Milk Stout that was on the board and she brought me something I wasn't expecting.  She didn't know they had anything else but I sent it back after telling her about the one that's being promoted. No glass was brought with the beer but I wasn't too concerned with that. We had a salad before our meal and then husband ordered spaghetti with meatballs, a calzone (?) for my son and pizza for me. She passed by the table and dropped of condiments -ketchup and mustard.  WHY?  Multiple tvs surrounding the dining area. I don't recall any volume... I don't think of this place as a sports bar but with what I saw playing on tv I think it probably falls into that category.  My pizza was primarily crust with sauce and a bit of cheese.   I had maybe 6 pieces of pepperoni, total, and this was the Classic  (Loads of pepperoni, mushrooms, Italian sausage, roasted garlic and Mozzarella).  The food is okay, but there are so many other places to go in the Valley for food that's "okay".  I would rather hit the Olive Garden or one of the many neighborhood Italian restaurants where the food it better than just okay.

Unaware pool service was scheduled I arrive hone to fund a van parked in front of our driveways. I call out in both yards to see who is back there and no reply. I cover half the yard and call out again and finally get some sort of response. I ask the guy to either pull into the driveway or move vehicle so it's not blocking drive.  I also inquired about what he was doing to which he replies "um, and who are you?!" I am officially po'd now. 'scuse me, you're trespassing and asking who I AM?! I am the home owner - NOT liking.

Location is alright cuz it's near Ultra.  Product selection is alright too.  Prices vary but if you shop enough you know a good price when you see it.  The check out can make or break your experience here.  Today it was a bust.  I was not going to stand in a line that went to the back of the store.  I'm thinking they need a couple more cashiers on the weekend.   I left what I was going to purchase and just left because I didn't want to stand in such a long line.

I walked in this afternoon CRAVING the (insert long name) Chicken Shawarma, walked by a table while we were being seated and I know I was probably gawking, but I wasn't drooling -yet.  Why in the world would Caramelized Cauliflower with Tahini cause such a reaction?!  I mean it's Cauliflower.  I have a thing for Cauliflower, so we ordered it.   This afternoon I decided to try something new and this was just a start.  My lunch choice is Beef Kafka. The starter was good.  I want the recipe or at least the basic instructions.  Nice touch with the Pine Nuts and Onions. The Beef Kafka is what I would call a Mediterranean version of a Tostada, or maybe Nachos.  Lavosh topped with cheese, beef, tomatoes, grilled onions, jalapeños, green onion, Pine nuts, and a creamy sauce lightly across the length.   The flavors blended well.  If possible the flavors blended TOO well.  I enjoy being able to differentiate the flavors of the various items that come together to create a dish, this one wasn't giving me that.  May be one of the reasons I like Shawarma?   Don't get me wring, the Beef Kafka was good but I couldn't keep my gaze from wandering over to my sons meal.  What do you call that?  Oh yeah, Pesto Pizza on Lavosh for $1.50 more. Maybe I'll try that next time.  Our server was super sweet and darned efficient too.  We talked briefly before I ordered cuz my son had stepped away momentarily.  So yah, uh huh, she thought it was a date scenario  and didn't realize that I was the young mans mother.  Oh Jiminy and Jay Jose' Phat ().... Yep, Mom here.   So we giggled for a minute and it was back to business.  Pita Jungle is one of those places I like to go to occasionally cuz I don't want to get bored with the menu. The relaxed atmosphere appears naturally well lit which makes being able to see the menu a real possibility.  Art by local talent is promintly displayed, the nearby water feature provides a peaceful view, and the decor is eclectic (?), Bohemian (?), or simply a crazy mish mash of someone's personal style.  I'll be back again soon for the Jalapeño and Cilantro Hummus and Chicken Shawarma. OH yeah, that Cauliflower dish I mentioned, I saw several more orders go out while we were there.  Must be a popular item.  And I almost forgot to mention something I didn't like. Soda/tea for almost $3.00. -I almost spit up. I guess that might be a way to discourage people from drinking soda, but tea?   Or maybe they're trying to encourage customers to order a beer or wine instead? Basically I just really dislike the idea of paying more than a buck fifty for soda. K, 'nuff from me.

We arrived so early that we were the first customers on this particular day.  Greeted promptly and seated at the bar.  Our host, the waitress, and our sushi chef were polite and efficient.  The music I would classify as synthetic meh and the restaurant very small but the décor was pleasant.  The food was real and very tasty.  The Copper River Salmon nigiri was rich, dense, fresh and delicious.  Agadashi was served like a soup with a fried Serrano garnish.  We had a couple of the Happy Hour rolls -Shimogamo was fresh and had a surprising hint of lemon.  Crazy roll was wrapped with rice paper so it even presented very differently. The Eel & cucumber was also very nice. As a whole the food and service were very nice, but I think the prices were a bit above what I may have paid elsewhere.  Or maybe it's possible the prices really didn't seem to match well to the portions or cut of a couple of things.   It's was $70 for two of us, two beverages -not cocktails, two rolls, one nigiri, and agadashi.  Just seemed a bit steep, especially with two of the items being part of the happy hour savings.

IF you go here for lunch don't park in area that is continuation of the drive thru.  One person taking orders = a line that rapidly grows and a longer wait for something that shouldn't require a wait.  The drive thru is typically the way I come through here and will be the only way from now on...

I was lured in by the National Cheesecake Day deal of half price cheesecake.  How can you go wrong with a deal? Service at the bar was okay but kinda slow because they had to get the salt for my Margarita and that took longer than it should've.  There were vacant seats at the bar and a couple took a pair of seats to my left and the gentleman waited until I got my drink so he wouldn't crowd me.  Another lady swooped in and was rude, bumping and crowding me unapologetically so she could have the vacant seat I opted to not be sitting in while I got my order. I was very glad to get away from that scene. The hostesses got us a table in just over five minutes and seated us promptly.  There was a lot of activity there on this particular day because everyone realized at the last minute that today was the last day for half price cheesecake.   Our waitress was sweet and kinda adorable too with her positive approach, bringing me water without asking, and helping to select menu options for hubby and myself.  I couldn't decide on dinner and asked for her to give me a recommendation.   I went with a salad, I think it was their version of an Asian salad but truly I just can't remember.  I had asked if there was a salad with strawberries and chicken and what she suggested is the one I had, but she got the kitchen to add strawberries so it was more to my liking.  Excellent. And hubbies pasta was served up as he had requested too.  Very nice. French fries that were supposed to be part of my sons meal were overlooked and didn't make it to the table until he was almost done with his sandwich. And the manager actually stopped by to apologize for the French fry oversight too. Here we were enjoying each others company and the food, discussing the day and such -not at all in a fuss about the overlooked FF, so it was a surprise to have him check in on us. It seems the spicy chicken sandwich he ordered was not what he had hoped for because it didn't have enough spice to really qualify as "spicy", but otherwise he said it was good. Now the cheesecakes, omg, there are so many options it's difficult to decide. I went with my first impression and got the Mango and Key Lime.  Not being a fan of Key Lime pie I wasn't so thrilled with that part but thought the Mango might make the Key Lime a nice blend.  Eh, not the case.  I felt I was eating a Key Lime with Mango cheesecake. Still good and after a couple bites with some coffee I decided I should have the rest packed up and it was time to go.  Prompt seating even through there was a huge crowd. Really good service, but the times I've been here before I guess this is standard and to be expected. Yummy meal that was ordered up with specific instructions and delivered as such.

Quaint looking place, but I don't understand the draw.   Food is okay but nothing special and service was below par.  Now I haven't dined with this business since it moved to this location.  Last time I ate at The Farm House it was a tiny farmhouse alongside the road. Server was kinda slow and really not familiar with the specials cuz "she doesn't usually work on Thursdays".  Whatever.  I mean there are only two (2) specials and Juevos Rancheros can be complicated. Well I will get back to the food... The ambiance is kitschy, simple, and sorta rustic.  The restaurant is small so it is no surprise to see long lines outside this place on a weekend morning.   So I ordered the Juevos Rancheros special and my son ordered the pancakes with eggs and bacon.  We determined we could have had a better breakfast elsewhere. Seriously.  Pancakes seemed to be from a mix and my Juevos Rancheros were nothing more then eggs to order on top of corn tortilla and topped with red enchillada sauce (canned?!) with refries (canned?) and a sliced potato on the side.  Oh my, don't tell my NM, Mexican, Tex -Mex food fans. Now canned isn't such a bad thing if it is done well but this seemed straight from the can.   And on top of the less than mediocre meal a guy in the booth behind me was kicking on my side of the bench, talking loudly on his phone the entire time we were there to his homie about a girl with issues (HIS words).   Prices didn't seem appropriate for food.  Maybe because of the location but certainly not the food. Not coming back.

Lawn a little long and squishy in some places from being overwatered, but seems to have some less wet areas for practicing handling with a pup for an upcoming show.  Night time makes it hard to get clear view but park has fair lighting in most areas and better in others. Plently of people walking their pets and the majority mind the law and have their pets on a leash.   Location has easy access and plenty of available parking spaces during the evening. Clean and nice overall.

Natural Whole Grain bread loafs that normally sell at AJ's Fine Food, Sprouts, etc. for $5.00+ every day.  Ive hears about this place from a Bountiful Baskets coordinator but just never made it here -until today., and thats just a good fluke.  So apparently on Wednesday and Friday at 1:00 p.m. the fresh loaves go on sale for $1.00.  A recent occurrence has caused them to put a limit of 10 loaves a day for the $.50 loaves (2 day old bread).  There is not a limit, currently, on the $1.00 (day old) or the $3.50 fresh bread. Great selection of breads too.  New varieties including a Honey Chia.  And most important thing I need to add, these are all ORGANIC bread loafs.

Came to Carr after a freind referred me.   Had crowns done in addition to regular maintenance.  Painful work, and I had never gone through anything like that before.  Ugh. My crowns are wearing alright ftmp but one broke while I was sleeping.  There were other things I experienced that just didn't rub me well when I was going there.   I don't go for all the gadgets or magazines. Dr. Carr himself had made some comment that I was over reacting or something to that effect made me feel uncomfortable.  His bedside manner isn't what I would classify as professional.   I had referred a few others to this location as well and they also quit going to this office. Personally, I haven't gone back cuz of the amount of discomfort experienced.

When I don't want to settle for fast food this place has lots of good options. Not cheap but generally good.  Soups, stews, chowders, chili, salad bar (hot and cold), and more.  They're not all located in the same area so if you haven't ever shopped here before this is your heads up.  They used to have raw for dogs that they would grind but it seems that's history now.  I do like to shop in the holistic area for "meds" for family and dogs.  Often refer others to Whole Foods for such things.   Like the cheese and wine selection as well as some of the things in the bakery area.   Not a full time shopper at Whole Foods.   It puts on a front that what it sells is natural or organic when in reality many of the products contain GMO's.  That's not very organic and so not worth the price.

Marg was good, sandwich was okay, service was alright but  OMG the kitchen is  S.  L.  O.  W... Really now, more than 45  minites to wait.  Shame.  After looking at our watches and determining the time my husband arrived and when the order actually had been taken it was closer to an hour. One last thing that sticks out is the patio umbrella situation.  Four tables, at least three umbrella stands, but only two umbrellas.  I had asked if we could get an umbrella for our table since we had been there more than an hour before our food arrived and it was noticeably HOT.  Being in uncomfortable conditions doesn't make for happy campers.  And waiting an unreasonable amount of time for the food doesn't help.  Would have spoke highly of server had she jumped on bringing an umbrella over from a recently cleared table but that didn't happen, no, we got up and got that cement base holder and rolled it over and pulled the umbrella and got that set up. And did ANY of the staff offer to lend a hand?! Hmpf.  Yeah, right.  Fix your patio too cuz it sounds like a few of those boards are gonna break.  They're definitely a hazard to walk on even if they don't break.

The water taste bad.  Give me a Margarita.  ándale The chips are fresh, warm and crisp.  The salsa mild and bordering on sweet.  Other reviews rave about their chips and salsa,  I wonder if those reviewers are seniors that just don't routinely eat spicy food. My Albondiga Soup was okay.  The meatballs had good flavor but we're really firm. The flour tortillas on the side were super hot and the butter I requested on the side was forgotten so I had to ask again. Server brought out some melted yellow stuff that was flavorless and grainy.  I did manage to talk my server into trying again and this time he succeeded in delivering the goods.   So while I'm enjoin my tortilla with montaquia I notice there's an abundance of silk plants all over this place.  Pictures on the wall include photos of what I suspect are menu items.  Subliminal sale perhaps. The dining area is somewhat dark, perhaps to help disguise the excessive decor. Hmm.  Well I need to look away from all of that and focus on my dinner. I will tell you this, the soup I had served wasn't even half as full of stuff as the one I saw pictured on Yelp.  I did take a photo and the difference is obvious. I needed to use my spoon to bring the contents toward the surface.  That other picture shows a bowl heaped FULL of veggies and such.  But even though it lacked in content the flavor was pleasant and filling. We come here maybe once every couple of years and I think with the price of menu items, the dated atmosphere, and the mediocre food that will be more than enough.

I so needed a beer.  Not hungry, just very thirsty for A BEER. And maybe dessert.   Love Nello's Pizza, like that they have a good selection of microbrews (sorry Barro's), fantastic Caprese salad, draft specials, and growlers too on top of everything I didn't mention. Happy Hour 3-6 pm Tuesday through Sunday with $2.50 domestics and $3.00 premium.  On Wednesday it is half off selected appetizers.  Limit 1 per table.

Usually here for the occasional diet Coke and occasionally an ice cream cone for the dogs, but since sometime around 7:00 a.m. this morning the place is gone -completely demolished.  Now why does that make me all happy and giddy with joy?  I imagine it's simply because it's too much of a temptation. Well I don't know this to be a fact but I'm fairly certain they'll be back.

C'mon, you are being much too hard on this place.   Great prices on most necessities, groceries not so much but I very rarely buy that stuff here.  Lame wine selection, but okay in the beer and alcohol department. Not quite as many strange characters as those you see in "The People of Wal-Mart" video (darn?). Generally this place has what I stop in for, except for chicken feed and quality kibble that is safe to feed your dog. Really folks, stop buying your dog food here. So TP, pain and allergy meds, cleaning supplies, Hanes socks and underwear for the men, Leggs nylons... Oh yeah, and a Subway too! Not much else. See?!  It's all good.

Decent location.  Rude employees... they only want to sell you stuff, not necessarily help you learn to minimize problems, and clearly returns are not a simple option.  We've been a customer here for a few years to maintain two pools.  For supplies and repairs we pay a few hundred every month.  Don't like how I'm treated by young man working morning/afternoon shift and have taken our business to a place where prices are much better and service is ample. They bought out Shasta Pools, good or bad, we'll limit our visits here to warranty stuff.

Great place and good bread selection.  Oroweat, Entenmanns, Boboli, Red Mill, Thomas', Bilbo, and various snack cakes and cookies.  Prices very reasonable.  Good place to save a few bucks if you haven't given up wheat/bread.

They get through a line of six or more customers in a couple minutes, prepare your order while you pay and wait.  In about five minutes they have your order packaged, call your name and then BRING it to you.  If you are eating your food here they bring it to your table.   .   I like this location, great service and friendly staff every time.

I've been coming here for years and have had three stylists at this business, but only one I've been coming to for a few years now and she does my hair as well as my sons. Very personable, serious interest in doing whatever it is that makes me happy.  I've referred her to many others inlcuding my sister-in-law and mother-in-law. My stylist has been there and available on the same day as my call.  In the past I've had to schedule weeks in advance. About the location: Nice and clean, plenty of stations for hair as well as nails.  Average level of noise.  Good location -but I have to say, I have a serious dislike for the parking lot.  Yeesh! This is kinda trivial but I actually like that my stylist offers me something to drink if I come in empty handed.  She even suggests I grab a bite if they have snacks out. She has become more like a friend than just a stylist too -and this is coming from a woman that was forever unhappy and unsatisfied by anyone that did my hair. She's introduced me to good products that work with my hair type and make the whole routine of doing my hair actually worth the time and effort. And of course the cut and style make a huge difference too.  I would tell you her name but then I would have to kill ya.

I'll take my business to FedEx or the USPS after my experiences with UPS stores.  They are expensive, lack decent customer service, manager is rude and micromanages the staff.  Hello, if they can't do the task without your "help" maybe you shouldn't have hired them or maybe you need to alter your training program. We have gone here merely for the convenience of the location(s) and have had to take business elsewhere for various reasons (purchasing stamps, mailing packages, etc.) Most recent visit, I arrived with a fax to send but a third customer that came in had hers sent first instead of waiting for mine.Had to wait for transmission receipt before they could send a new fax.   Business where my fax was being sent closed during the wait for the other customers fax and mine never went through.  Thanks for that. I have got to remember to stop going there.

Great thin crust pizza.  Fair beer selection.  Blah wings.  Clean place.  Super friendly staff. This is my favorite pizza here in the Valley. Dump the chains and support a GREAT local business. It isn't what I think of when you say Chicago style (crust) but we keep coming back for more.

I would bring my Sheltie here to be groomed.  They always made time in their schedule to groom him exactly as asked. No perfume-y shampoo, close sanitary, trimmed ears and paws. I used to purchase food here in bulk but had since changed what I fed. They have reduced the products a bit and seem to have put their focus on grooming. Interesting to see the condition how some of these pets are brought in for grooming. I've seen several dogs and cats brought in with matted coats and nails so long I couldn't believe the animal could walk on its feet. Unfortunately the only fix in some situations is shaving the coat off.   These ladies do a great job cleaning up these animals, making them more presentable and much happier too.

Delicious treats. Impressive selection.  Cream puffs, Napoleons, fruit tarts, quiche, dumplings, apple fritters, cookies, Alligators, etc. The selection is classic, the quality ideal, the taste is delicious. I hit up this place every time I'm in the area no matter how hungry I am.

This place is alright.  An old Taco Bell converted into a donut shop that's put the drive through to use, that means your weekday donuts get there not long after you've arrived.  Hehe!   Seriously though, the drive through seems like a good option but I haven't tried it because I fear the decision making process will then come to a screeching halt because I would be lacking the ability to actually SEE what they have. FTMP, all of the donuts they sell here are a glazed donut, some with a different twist (literally) and some with the addition of spice, fruit, or flavored gel.  They are good, but I gotta tell ya, my first job was in a bakery so I have a liking for more than a simple glazed donut.  Oh alright, I'm picky.  Listen, if I'm paying I can be picky.   I'll give this the thumbs up for location and the drive through has to be a bonus for some.  For me, I'll stay with my personal fave and go to Bashas.  Still baked in the store, good and fresh, and quite possibly cheaper than what they sell here too.

This place is super awesome! This place is also super chaotic because the prices are great and the selection is good so it draws a LOT of customers.  You bump carts almost every 5 to 10 feet, aisles are always full, sometimes you have to wait to pass -unless you used to cocktail waitress and you know how to get through the crowd.  Haha. Not really conveniently located but well worth the drive.  If you want to can some produce, have company coming, a big dinner, or something else that requires a bulk purchase, this IS the place to hit.  Love it and wish I had come here a long time ago.  Oh yeah, good size parking lot to accomodate all of those customers.

First thing, this place is way out in the East Valley.  That's only one downside. They have a large parking lot.  So you think people can drive to an area where its obvious that there's a vacant space?  No, seems parking near the door is preferred and some folks can be obnoxious about it too.  Great prices makes us cuckoo I guess.  I come here when I get the bug for canning something.  Keep in mind, if you have guests, a party in the works, or maybe you're putting together a dish to pass for a family reunion, this place can help minimize the expense.  Once inside you'll find fresh produce, fruits and veggies, with prices so low you'll take a second and third look.  They also have jams, sorghum, honey, cheeses, bread, candies, and much more. Organic Strawberries were 3 for $1.00 today.   Blueberries were 3 for $1.00 (6 oz.) or .79¢ for the 8 oz container.  Raspberries were 2 for $1.00 Cherries were .59¢ lb Just really great prices on quality produce.  The place gets busy but after 2 p.m. it's just chaotic.  Parking lot is the worst. In the morning it's busy, and with shopping carts filling quickly it's easy to understand why you may ocassionaly bump into or get bumped into while reaching for something or simply turning away. So be careful, don't go to fast, try,not to be in a hurry.  I think everyone's first time here is a real eye opener. Get there soon, you'll kick yourself for not going sooner.

When we arrived a gentleman was power washing the laundry carts.  He asked if we could relocated the vehicle cuz he was also cleaning the parking spots. Not a problem.  It's good to see this kind of maintenance. So you have to purchase a card to run the machines since this place is coinless.  Cards cost .50 and the fee is deducted from the amount you spend.  For example, $20.00 got me a card with $19.50 -but they can be reloaded, so don't throw it away if you think you'll be back here ever. Location is clean and there are plenty of machines available, except for the single load uprights cuz a few of those had out of order signs posted. In order of size, prices are 1 (load) - $1.59, 2 - $2.59, 3 - $3.99, 4 - $4.79, 6 - $6.09, and 8 - $7.25.  Seems the average wash time is posted as 23 minutes. .....Cold morning and they have the doors open in front and in back.   So far the rinse cycle is looking good.  No suds visible like what I saw at Tempe, Rural & Broadway, laundromat. Dryers also vary in price based on size.  Six load dryer costs .80 for 20 minutes and the larger 8 load was $1.00 I assume for same amount of time. Although I could tell the washers rinsed efficiently, the dryers didn't seem to dry any quicker.  I will say that the dryers actually got HOT and didn't seem to waste minutes ($$) on a cool down cycle.  Again, the Tempe laundromat we previously visited had dryers that really weren't efficient at drying. Sorry for making comparisons but trying to locate a decent laundromat in the area is challenging enough and  i find details to be beneficial. What cost about $10 to dry at other laundromat cost $3.20 here.  You do the math. Clean, maintained, and appliances functioning as anticipated.  No magazines, and you have to use your card to access the restroom if attendant isn't nearby. I spent less than $20.  Not great, but not as bad as I expected.

Service - very nice, efficient, informative, and no pushy sales (jk). Wait - mmmaybe ten minutes.  We dined in so we certainly weren't in a hurry.   Food - started with chips and salsa.  Best tortilla chips ever.  Thick, but crispy so they break clean and easily but no threat to breaking teeth.   Salsa was innocent, until you least expect it and then it sneaks up and says hello.  A nice bit of flame to lure you back for more.  I think my Mother In Law might like this stuff. My breakfast was Juevos Rancheros and it was prepared much differently here than anywhere else I've had it.  Those other places must be fakin' it.  Crisply fried flour tortilla topped with two eggs and their green sauce, refried beans and some fantastic fried potatoes on the side along with a hot flour tortilla wrapped in foil to keep it hot. I think I heard myself say, "Get in my stomach" outloud!  I'm so embarrassed.   Okay, not really.  It was smelling so good and several steps from the norm, I was happy to have a fork in my hand and doing its thing. I couldn't finish my breakfast but my son was happy to finish the task and lick the plates clean.  I enjoyed talking to the owner and the wife of the gentleman whose art graces the walls.   I enjoy seeing nice art by local talent on display, and how cool is it that he's part of the business too.  Great food and a feast for the eyes as well. Love having another fantastic dining option.

Greeted and seated immediately at 8:30 a.m. on a Holiday weekend.  Major plus in my book. The place is hoppin' with retirees and small families for the most part. Food was served in maybe five minutes.  Amazing. Eggs, hashbrowns and the corned beef were okay, the gravy on the biscuits was fine too but the biscuit was tasty and darn near perfect. Marci was our server and she was prompt, polite and efficient.  Kudos to the pleasant staff.  We've been back once since initial experience and still a good place to have breakfast.

Kinda busy and slow upon entry, but service was prompt and the noise level soon dropped as the "old men's clubs" gradually departed.  Okay, jk, but there were several groups of older men here today.  I noticed on the menu that the corn cake is a Midwest favorite.  I've never had it and ftm, I had never heard of it before either.  So after a few questions I decide to give it a try.   I'll preface the rest and simply say I'm not gonna order it again. It was, um, well it was just bland.  I couldn't figure out how to enhance it (butter, syrup, bacon, salt, catsup, etc.) so it had some appeal. Yeah sure, maybe it's something you grew up with and you developed a taste for it but to me it was little more than being totally non-descript.   So unless you're a fan, I recommend that you stick with the more traditional items on the menu.   Biscuits and gravy -good Waffles - good Chicken fried steak - good Hash browns - good Coke products -works for me Food has been consistent, served in less than ten minutes.  Service every time I have been here has been what I would call ideal.   Friendly, prompt, attentive but without hovering.    And kudos to the owner who came out to chat with me when I had a thousand questions.  He was kind enough to give me the low down on the Midwest favorite. Maybe I should've asked him to add cornbread to the menu. Well we will keep coming back cuz it's all really good stuff.

It's alright.  Walk up window and a drive through.  Improvements are being made to the sidewalk or patio area.   I had the Shrimp and French fries after seeing the fish was a thin, square patty.  Shrimp was okay and the fries were good too.  Wish their Pirate sauce had a bit more substance so it could hold up to catsup cuz the flavor was good.  BTW, their Pirate sauce is their cocktail sauce.   I might go back.  It's not bad at all. Probably most disappointed that I couldn't get a small soda refill without chucking over more than half the price of a small soda.

Been coming here for years.  Miss a couple of the girls that used to work here.   Still, ftmp,  we get good service.  I drop off bags full of men's shirts to be laundered along with womens suits for dry cleaning in addition to the few assorted things that need to get done. Occasionally things have happened but they fix the issue and tend to get things worked out. Overall I've been pleased with the service, staff, and work done.

Not cheap but they are efficient and make the effort to provide good customer service. Anything not completely cleaned will be redone, and if necessary it will be done a third time and with a different method upon customer approval.  They do good work. Been coming here for years and have seen the changes brought with new ownership, most of which are nothing to brag about. Miss the girls that used to work here.  What I'm not happy about is they mention a discount on Facebook and I have mentioned not being able to find said discount on the last four or five times I've been in.  Whomever handles the Facebook page -please make that discount EASIER to find. I've asked that you tag me the first time I searched for it. I also showed the gentleman at this location the hundreds of photos (why?!) on your Facebook page and still have not found the discount that you mention on the entrance/exit area of business. I still haven't found the thing.

As stated previously, we've been coming here for years.  Well before the management from CA came in and took over.  We have a lot of cleaning done here routinely and because of this we get a bag to toss all our stuff in and they give us a small discount.  The discount isn't a lot but the fact we get it with every order makes a good difference.  Any piece of clothing that has come back with a spot has been brought to the attention of the person behind the counter, the item is sent back to be recleaned and if necessary I sign off so the item can actually be laundered. To date I've had more luck and success with this dry cleaner than I have with some of the other local (CHEAP) dry cleaners.  One such place totally lost my entire order and treated me like I was a raving lunatic.  Damn I should've called 12 for Action on them, but I was upset at my loss at the time.  Anyway, a couple of recent rants and bad reviews, including one that suggested that the person giving this company five (5) stars must've been "compensated", caused me to come back and update my review with additional details.  I've worked various jobs in customer service over the years and I can tell you it's one thing that hardly exists these days.  However, when I've had an issue I brought it to their attention and things got straightened out.  And believe me, I wasn't happy in those situations.  But they rectified the situation and that IS the customer service which causes me to be a happy and satisfied customer. My 20+ years of going there is by far a more realistic view of this business. So IF they did a poor job you need to send it back to be done right.  If you don't do that then you only have yourself to blame.

Same Regency Cleaners staff and locations,  just new business name, ownership with more focus placed on a more environment friendly product and more current style.  No price changes.    Hoping to see an improvement from previous ownership.  I know the staff makes great efforts to provide customer care and service.  In the past I watched some good employees walk away and I am certain it was because of upper management aka previous owners.

Haven't I reviewed this place before?!  I LOVE HOT!  Reason I came on this day is because a friend from Napa, CA was in town for shows and I brought her here last time she was in town and it was her request that we come again.  Like I said, I LOVE this place and you'll have a hard time getting me to decline.  However, on this particular visit I have to say my meal was just okay.  Generally it's fantastic but what I ordered just wasn't up to par.  I had the chicken and dumplings as my entree.  Again, everything else was very nice.  It was a very cold evening but we kept shuffling closer to the heat lamps and sharing our jackets, doing whatever was necessary to keep warm. So the meal I wasn't so satisfied with -the chicken was dry.  I prefer dark meat because it's moist, white meat is always risky because it gets dry and I can't choke that stuff down so easily unless you make it into a chicken salad.  Dry white meat = not great.  The dumplings were DEVINE and I want the recipe.  Mmm mmm MMMM!  Our server, Greg, was wonderful and was on top of the recommendations and descriptions. Suprisingly it was very busy on that chilly eve and that kept him busy too.  My guests from Napa, Oakland, and Paso Robles enjoyed their meal and the experience.  Hopefully they'll have an opportunity to come again when it's a bit warmer and we have more daylight hours to enjoy the views that surround.

Chips and bean dip are good. Salsa doesn't have a bite so to me it's lacking. Came in here around 3 p.m. and almost expected them to be closed but nope, late lunch crowd.  That would be us and another party of six? Beverage delivery to our table was super slow.  Busgirl asked our drink order, then server asked, and yet it felt like it was forgotten. That is until server finally shows up, with the wrong drink. Entrees ordered and they arrive.  Two entree with one side combo wasn't quite prepared right.  It appears they served a cheese enchilada with meat on the outside to make up for the fact it was suppose to be a meat enchilada. Mexican veggies side and black beans had cheese all over them.  Enough already with the cheese.  I was trying for something with fewer calories. Server was kind to stop by to fill sons soda but overlooked water glasses.  Did return, took one of the glasses and filled it from the sink behind the booth. Lovin' me some tepid tap water. Hostess/manager passed by to ask how everything was.  I always say, if you really don't want to know how the meal is you visit the table right when someone puts a bite into their mouth. Food was alright. Service wasn't what I would have expected.  We used to come here pretty regularly as a family but the quality just hasn't been up to snuff and now the service.

It cost for air?   Close to Marcos de Niza which may contribute to the things I dislike about this location.  Bad drivers, too fast and out of control.  Messy store, dirty, sticky counters.   Congested when more than a few customers.  Routinely out of things and the staff tells me one item is no longer available (Hershey's Chocolate Carmel individual creamer) although I have gotten it at several other locations recently.   Coffee burner under pot off and so coffee is not hot. Overhead music playing AND a radio playing different music loud.  Location pluses - access is not so difficult, and they sell alcohol from airline size bottles up to full size bottles.  Overall though I feel this is just a poorly managed, dirty, messy store.

Slow service, unless you're a regular.  :-( I was here before 6 a.m. and there were two people behind the counter and one that was just walking back there.  The two that were behind the counter just looked at me but didn't say good morning or we'll be with you in a minute.  When the third person came around the counter one of the other two said something to him about something in one of the ovens and so he stops and tends to whatever that was.  So finally he makes it to the register and takes my order. Nothing difficult, three bagels toasted with cream cheese to go.  A customer came in a few minutes after me, placed his order and had his drink and food before mine was ready.   Seems regular customers get more priority. But from the looks of other recent reviews they really should focus on getting their act together because in this area we have more than one option.

Slower every time I come.  Today order was done wrong.  It is not busy so why must we wait for service (to order and to pay) and then receive order half right. We hit another location in the area and always get better service so we decided that's just where we'll take our business.

Picking up my ride after having service done and what appears before my eyes, a clean and shiny ride.  They removed the protective cover (dust, bug remains, dog slobber which runs the length of the rear window to the tailgate, road crud, etc.) and I almost didn't recognize my own vehicle. The a/c is cranking out the cold air once again now that the belt has been replaced.  Other regular scheduled maintenance has been performed and I think my handsome beast of a car is feeling happy too.   We are good to go. Off again to battle traffic in the VOTS.

I had made an appointment at Chapman but I guess because they were a bit overwhelmed dealing with recall work I was directed to come here.  And then I can't find them on Yelp?!  So I come over here, get checked in, and then go to town adding this biz.   Melissa was super awesome getting me checked in and aiding with bringing my hackles down.  You know how it is when things don't go quite as planned.  So she got my vehicle checked in and kindly suggested that I help myself to coffee or water in the lobby.  She also explained to me why the switcheroo took place.  Here before 7 a.m., oil change, tire rotation, AND a car wash.  Send me away a happy customer.

They have the fitbit aria scale here!   So it's $129.99.  The fitbit flex in slate or violet is $99.99.  Yeesh! I don't shop here routinely but this is one of the stores I come to purchase cd's when they're on sale.  For whatever reason they have a much better selection than Mall Wart and they usually have a new release, that I might like, at a low price every couple of months. What I don't like about Target is their cheezy baskets of seasonal items on display near the entrance.  Lots of poor quality, Made in China items, sold for next to nothing.  I see most of this stuff as waste that frequently winds up at Goodwill and/or landfills. The store is generally clean and shelves stocked.  The staff is pleasant enough. Not sure how much profit they've generated now that all employees walk around attached to walkie talkies (you remember those right?  I mean you're old enough to remember those, right?), but wish they could turn the volume down on the things and possibly refrain from following me while talking on them.  I always turn around to see if they're talking to me because like I said, I don't shop here regularly.

I can't believe I'm considered a regular here.  Service is lame to pathetic.  There is no customer service, it's more like a question and answer at the drive through.  Curt.  No explanations.  No apologies.   Nada.  This is what it costs and then the obnoxious and sarcastic "Have a good night."  Ya know DQ, I could get a cheaper cone at McDonald's or even better, a frozen custard from Freddies.  And there is Rita's too.  So many more options -it's not just DQ.  Get your stuff together and teach your staff to get the job done and add a dose of common courtesy to the "customer service."

The croissants had improved so nicely since my previous review. Size, filling, texture and taste are ideal.  So I felt drawn back to that light flakey texture, buttery deliciousness....  Previous visit: Yesterday (weeks ago) was not consistent at all.  The croissants looked like blobs.  I even asked if they had a new Baker working today and the guy helping to get our order to ld me no, he's the same baker.   I picked up a dozen to take to my vets office and we ate one on our way.  That croissant was more like bread.  It was not flakey, airy, buttery.  It was more like bread.  Even the almond flavor was off. I had specifically requested the chocolate and Bavarian cream (?) filled croissant for Cindy at the front desk of the office.  What arrived was the Chocolate Chip filled one.  Not such a bad deal but she finished while I was still at the office and told me there was not a single Chocolate chip inside. P. Croissant, you're working on a record low. I could've picked up doughnuts, or hit the bakery (Karls) closer to their office, but I thought this would be a good stop on this day.  This morning: Went in to see croissants that appeared about 1/3 smaller and almost flat.  Just blob looking things. I was trying to decide which to have packed up and just changed my mind and left   Just very bummed. We used to come to Pleasant Croissant when owned by the original owner and they may have run out early but there was always delicious consistency back then.

Helpful staff.  Good prices on most things here. Decent location. Parking is kinda lame but eh, that's not a big deal really.  I'm all for supporting a local business. Oh, but hey, we need bigger containers of chlorine. Those 25 lb bucket just aren't enough for us.  Can you do that sometime soon?

Back in the 80's I worked down the street at Old New York and lived across the street at Villa Manana.  I enjoyed coming here with friends and co-workers, sharing pitchers of Margaritas and trying my first Chimichanga.  Fast forward 30+ years and this place is now more of the occasional, sentimental stop.  The chips and salsa are yummy, house $3 Margs are rather tasty compared to many other restaurants house Margaritas.  Listen, I'm really picky about such things.  I don't want syrup and flavor on ice -tasteless, expensive, and lacking that kick that takes the edge off of the day. Lunch was tasty and really satisfied my desire for a taste of the past.  I had the Red Chimichanga, which comes with sour cream AND guacamole.  Other restaurants charge extra but here it's already included.  Two thumbs up. Service was just okay.  Kinda slow but always courteous and professional. Overall a very positive experience. We'll continue to make our visits here at the TeePee part of our random routine.

Small OLD, venue.  But that's what I love about this place.  Great memories from the 80's.  Ahhh. Room to sit and listen and room to get up and dance.  How can you not love that?!  The radio station that hosted this event had the bass cranked so loud you could tell the equipment couldn't handle it well and it sounded HORRIBLE.  H O R R I B L E. Wavering, uneven, loud bass sound ruined the (radio?) music making the lyrics distorted.  Sadly a long anticipated performance kinda went down the tubes too. It was bad enough that it was unusually cold, but when the bands that were performing, the ones I had waited years to see, it was like the sound system just crashed. You could see on the face of the vocalist their surprise too. Just unbelievable. Was it Mesa Amphitheatres fault or the bands light and sound mans? I don't know but I suspected it was just part of what was going on with the music when we arrived.  So sad.   I heard the concert held the day prior which was part of this event did not experience the same issues.

The place is small but they have a patio that appears to accomodate as many folks outside as the actual dining room.  Menu is above register which is also where the baked goods case is located.  Makes it difficult to come in and view the case while someone is placing their order.  Intersting menu items and decadent looking desserts.  That Napoleon LOOKS impressive.  If I make it back here I WILL be having one of those.  I ordered a scramble with spinach in it -can't recall the name.  It was just okay.  It was more like a fluffy, undercooked omelette.  That could be a HUGE problem if I had been dining here with my spouse but for me, eh, no worries.    The macaroon was interesting but not like a traditional macaroon, much bigger to start.  Have to say it was rather tasty too.  My issue with this place - It took so long to get our food.  For almost $24.00 I could get a full breakfast served and my coffee refilled.  I just don't think you get your money's worth here and the long wait just took it off of my places I bookmark.  For a week day the place was hopping and the parking lot was crazy -and it wasn't even close to the lunch hour.

Okay, we are back.  My favorite places to dine I try to visit a few times a year cuz I don't want to ruin a good thing by od'ing on it.  Ya know what I mean?  We have dined at Yupha's when it was in the strip mall behind Olive Garden just up the road for 5 1/2 years, and more routinely at this location which they have been at for more than five years now.  Yep, we have been dining at Yuphas that long.  Almost hard to believe they've been around that long, but I'm very glad they have been successful.  So onward and forward.  Tonight I was seated promptly and given a chance to review the menu options.  Was pleasantly surprised to see new items on the menu AND a wine list with a selection that's much improved ---that alone was long overdue.   So many tasty sounding options, that alone makes deciding a difficult thing to do. I opted for a salad with duck, red onion, green beans, etc. and my son chose Pan Ang Curry. Our server was polite, efficient, and  she did not hover excessively.  I could only ask that she returned sooner to take our order but part of that is our fault not being able to decide quickly.  I blame the new menu options for distracting me.  Favorites: Himalai Pra Ram Pink Diamond Tofu Song Krung Thai Jerkey -the Papaya Salad is an acquired taste that I haven't acquired.   The Curry's are also fantastic but our favorites are the Red and Panang.  Occasionally I like to have the Drunken Noodles or Yupha's Fried Rice.  Yummy stuff.  Conveniently located near the Tempe Pollack Cinemas makes it all too convenient to catch a movie before or after a delicious meal here. We have been tempted to bring a meal in with us from Yupha's but I think others might be distracted by the fragrant aromas of real food.  Glad this restaurant is in my neck of the woods.

The place was open on Sunday -two thumbs up. Especially after I drove to Mesa to hit the feed barn over on Main and saw they were closed.   The young lady working this particular early afternoon was pleasant and helpful.  She sold me on some wood shavings, provided me info on the chicks they had in the store on that day, and unbeknownst to her, almost sold me on a turkey chick.  Wouldn't that be fun? Seems like the place got crazy busy during the time I was looking at the chicks and the poultry supplies.   Shop is kinda small and well stocked so a few customers make it look busy quick. She gave me info about the Gilbert HS program that might prove useful in the near future too. I walked in only needing wood shavings but left with a small hen feeder, an apple scented Jolly Ball, scratch for my hens, and a huge bag or wood shavings for the nesting boxes.  I don't like the parking set up much.  Seems there are a select few that feel they must park right in front of the entrance to the building.  I am talking less than 10' from the entrance.    Can I suggest that folks avoid buying and giving their pups a 5 in 1 vaccine here? A combo vacc is hard on the babies system.  Look up Jean Dodds vaccine protocol. Best to give your pups a good, healthy, start in life.

I've been coming here for a couple of years now and like a few others it has become a habit.  I am NOT one of those freaks that comes here on Thursday and waits outside for the place to open so I can run in, grab a shopping cart and fill it with every single item that has a specific tag color and then makes the rest of the shoppers stand in line for eons while the cashier has to ring up their 100+ item purchase. WE come here looking for bargains, yes, but just a couple things here and there and often times the full price items.  What don't they have? Well that really just depends on the day.  This place has darn near everything, including empty liquor bottles.  Why?! Yeah, even Goodwill has trash on the shelf for sale sometimes.  Some things are priced fairly, and then there are things that are just outrageously priced.  You must be a good shopper to know if you're being ripped off. For example, I can get dog beds at Costco for less than $20 and they had the same one here, used/dirty, priced for $20.  Now tell me that's not ridiculous.  I will suggest you not feel conned into giving any more of your money when the cashier asks you to make a donation.  Do some research and you will see that Goodwill already makes a great profit and what they give to the community isn't nearly as much as those commercials say.

Came here for a meeting of the Working Dog Club of Arizona.  Accidentally left my purse and didn't realize this until I was across town.  Called and spoke to Brittany and confirmed it was still there, sped across town again to pick it up.  Arrived about 20 minutes after making the call. Was pleased I was able to get my purse back. Was NOT the least bit pleased to find my payment for a previous day judging assignment had been depleted by 20%.  Hmm.  Now who would have done that?!  Thanks so much for staying there so I could retrieve my purse.  A small compensation would have made its way into my hands had there not already been money missing.  Who knew they had a "finders fee"?! Extremely disappointed since this club plans to meet at this location monthly. I will be making a call in the morning. Will also encourage the club to put further consideration into meeting elsewhere.

What a great experience.  I am really glad we stopped.  You made a new fan of us.  Parking lot sucks if you go there during busier times of the day.  People are just crazy, overly enthusiastic about getting a parking spot, or just plain rude.  Once you get parked and you wander inside is actually rather impressive if you're the type that likes book stores.   I guess I am. But this place isn't your typical bookstore.  First thing you should know is it's a used book, cd, album, audio book, magazine, instrument, toys, childrens books, games, crafts, games, accessories, collectibles, and tchotchkes of just about every kind available for purchase here.   It's like a bookstore, rummage sale, warehouse here.  Folks bring their things in and hope to walk out with some cash in exchange.  I spend an hour or two in here each time we come and more often than not we walk out with at least one small purchase.  Love finding older issues of magazines and assorted, random knick knacks.  This place is almost like an antique store.  You can reminisce about so much that they have for sale. They have their own t-shirts, aprons, mugs and water bottles.  They host events for adults and children ranging from music to entertainment.  My favorite time to come here is right when them open on a weekday because, well, that's how I roll.  It's peaceful and if I come in with one of my dogs we don't get bothered like we're some kind of side show in a traveling circus. Truthfully, my dogs love the attention -cuz ya know they're soooo deprived.   So to wrap this up I have got to say I am so glad we stopped to check things out.

This is my third time to Zipps, second visit to this location.  It is hopping.  NBA Finals today -- it's LOUD (certainly there must be a movie playing around here somewhere cuz its like booming Dolby surround sound) and the place is packed.  Really though, good food, good selection, good prices, and good cocktails, no surprise this place is busy. Being a fan of Margarita rocks I have to tell you their Zipparitas really are something special. I also like their Buffalo Wings.  Their hot is the perfect level of hot for me too.  Not wimpy and not the acid burning stuff either.   And can't forget to mention that their wings are meaty too.  Gawd I hate paying outrageous prices for wings that look like they came from anorexic hens.  Sheesh!   So we arrived during unhappy hour and got a few minutes to enjoy a Zipparita while deciding on our dinner options. Hmmm, what sounds good tonight?

I rarely shop here but was quite surprised to find all the great bargains today.  Is it possible those things I'm shopping for just weren't here before?   Sure that's possible.  So I'm picking up a scrip for my boy AND I learned they have/can get Baytril here too!!!

So Emily at the PUW couldn't answer my question about a salad that was on the menu so she says "just a sec" and then disappears without any explanation.  Then a young man continues the conversation.  I ask the weight of the salad and he tells me "just a minute."  He comes back and tells me they aren't a set amount, they all vary.  I inquired about the type of apples on one of the salads and I'm told red and green. I'm tired of ordering food and the employees knowing nothing about what they're selling.  No clue how many ounces in the beverages, no idea the weight of meat on a sandwich or what toppings are on it so they have to put you on 'hold" so they can ask someone else. I accept this lack of info, complete my order, pay, and as I begin to drive off I observe two guys and at least one girl finding this situation particularly humorous. So the (clueless) customer is funny now?  Bleu cheese on my salad was warm which seems strange. Thanks for making my dining experience after a long day of volunteering, painting, and then yardwork a pleasant end of the day.

I get so frustrated when you get home and most of the order is incorrect or items are missing. What more do I need to say about that? The interior is surprisingly dirty/messy, especially considering the location.  The last time I dined at this location I said out loud that I can't believe the condition of this place and had I known I would make the choice to go elsewhere.

Sorry Cliff but I get better customer service at any of the other locations. Decided I'm not going to be hitting this stop any longer since the manager is charging more for coffee. All of the other locations give you a break on filling your own mug. Here they will charge more if your mug even looks big. Gas is cheaper up the road too. I'll just stick with the other locations.

This evening I came for pick up.  Decided a glass of wine and an appetizer to share before we would head home with dinner would be nice. Apparently something went wrong in the kitchen cuz after about 20 minutes our appetizer was handed to us in the To Go container and the rest of our food order maybe five minutes to completion.  I opted to leave them packed and just take home with the entire meal.  Manager was quick to remedy the situation by breezing by and dropping off a couple of appetizers cards to apologize for the mishap.  He really was apologetic and it was obvious he had the best intentions. They also offered a comp'd Lettuce Wraps for us to dine on while they finished our order but since that was my husbands meal I declined the generous offer and said no thank you. Mgr did tell me our appetizer was redone and offered them to us again but I figured that since our meal was done I should just take it home so the family gets fed.   Was super delighted to get home and learn my husbands chicken portion of his ck wraps was not what it was supposed to be. Ck chunks, bits of corn, and I don't know what else. So he basically didn't eat Pei Wei tonight and decided or get himself a burger....

The gas was $.02 cheaper than Gas Buddy had posted.  That's a plus. The area where the fountain drinks are located was just disgusting.  Every step was echoed with the sound of pulling your shoe/foot up off of the floor.  It was almost as if they had mopped the area with fountain soda and left it to dry. Just gross.  Everything else seemed fine but couldn't understand why they seemed to be fully staffed and the area by the drinks was in such horrible condition.

I just don't get why people come here to shop. A lot of Made in China products and other things that make me think filler for landfills.   Most of the stuff here you can get elsewhere for the same price. Someone I know mentioned reader glasses but I think as hard as I am on them they would be trashed by the first couple of days of use. I have purchased one thing here, pumice stones, and only because I liked the color options. A friend told me about those green bags that are for extending the shelf life of fresh produce and that's the only reason I can into this store.  And darn it, they don't sell them.

Good prices on many items, but not everything.  I like that you can get boxes of full size candy bars in which it calculates to about. $.51 a bar.  Sometimes they have a deal on whole cases of fruit, like bananas for $0.47 lb instead of the regular price of $0.57 sale price per pound.  And they have tomatoes available like this too.  As a past cake decorating instructor I will also tell you this is the place to get Pastry Pride, non-dairy whipped topping that you use in homemade buttercream icing.   Mmm. Check the ads and compare prices.  Good place to come if you plan to entertain a crowd.

Not cheap but it is good pizza. My family   likes white pizza  and since the place where we used to get white pizza  is no more this is the next best thing. Monday and Tuesday are THE bargain nights.  For something like $15.95 you can get any 3 item 16" pizza .  They're regular $21.50! And for $5.00 more you could get a second. They also have slices that are about the size of an entire pizza .  YOWZA!!!   Good location too. I just pop in here, order a couple pizzas  and stroll over to Zipps for a beverage  and some music  while I sit and peruse the stuff on my smartphone, then go back to pick up MY delivery order.   Parking lot can be a challenge depending on time you're here and what game is on or what Holiday  we're celebrating. You know what they say -it is what it is.

Love the raw milk. I initially started my search for raw milk when I began making my own milk kefir.  Since that time I have gone from a craigslist person offering their cows milk to Save Your Dairy.  A major improvement in service and quality.  Okay, I'm joking cuz on Craigslist you can't really expect "customer service" that a business/employee might provide.  Anyway,  I like the milk here quite a bit and my son can consume several gallons a week. I like the option to have milk that has NOT been treated (pasturized and hogonized) to a point that the natural, beneficial enzymes have been destroyed. Here I can get raw organic cows milk for drinking, making milk kefir, making cheese, and sharing with friends   Milk that doesn't spoil.   What's old is new again.

I kinda miss Sunflower Market but Sprouts is very similar to me, a non regular health food grocery store shopper.  Yeah, that's what ya call 'em.  But really, I like the fresh, ripe produce, the spices and herbs you can purchase by the oz., the extensive selection of vitamins, supplements, and homeopathic items.  This is one of my go to places for  Boiron.  They have raw milk here too.  And let me just tell you this, their prices beat Whole Foods by at least a buck ($1.00).  How's that for a bargain?

So here we are, Tuesday night dinner and I'm not really hungry.  I mean I've normally got a healthy appetite (healthy appetite -you know, something more than just a salad or a nibble of something)  but tonight I'm not so hungry so I ask if I can split a quesadilla with hubby.   Steak please.  He comes home with that thing and at first I'm thinking this isn't right cuz the container is too light.  Yes I know a tortilla, cheese, and beef really shouldn't weigh a lot.  Don't ask me what I was thinking.  Besides, by then it was probably my stomach talking. Opened it up and revealed the toasty, fragrant tortilla with Mexican cheese and chunks of beef.  *inhale*  A small nibble and my taste buds were telling me to stop multi tasking and just eat.  The tortilla was darn near perfect tonight.  The cheese was buttery, and not too much either.  And the ideal amount of tender beef was included.  The green salsa caught me by surprise tonight.  A little fire there.  I used almost an entire bullet for a half of my meal.  I don't understand, I really wasn't that Hungry tonight. I still had to have some red salsa.  I was torn.  The quesadilla was delicious by itself.  Warm, toasty tortilla with cheese and beef.   Mmm mmm. And here I wasn't very hungry. This place is consistently good.   Fresh salsas. Green Chile Burritos. Breakfast Burritos. Thin, crispy, tortilla chips. And the staff is courteous,  knowledgeable,  and have been pleasant every time I've been there. It all keeps me (us) coming back for more.

Fantastic selection of STUFF.  I'm not an hunter but I think the display is interesting.  The big aquarium is neat for checking out a few of the various kinds of fish that inhabit the lakes and streams of our country, but it's kinda hard for me to actually tell em apart.  They have a good clothing selection for men and women as well as some good deals on the off season apparel. Bass Pro Shop also provides seasonal activities for the entire family. There's the target for adults and kids upstairs.   A great selection of camping supplies.  Grills, dehydrators, coolers,  smokers, meat grinders, fishing supplies, traps, just so many different things. This place is a store within a museum.

Ordered two 44 strawberry fruit slush and one corn dog.  Gave 5.39, bill was 3.39 and Serena tries to give me $1.00 and change back and two 32 oz drinks.  :-( I brought change to her attention and had to check size on cup. On a more recent trip through the drive through I again had a similar experience in which the cashier at the window did not give me all my change.   I'm not tipping a buck to these people when I come through the drive through.  Seriously, this is ridiculous that they even attempt to pull off this little maneuver.

A bargain if there ever was one.  A/C is cranking almost year round.  Sometimes want them to turn it off cuz it can get chilly inside the theater.  Popcorn is okay, somedays it's better than others. I like that you can get a big popcorn and bring the bag back another time for the second fill.  We rarely eat all of the popcorn but because we can bring it back for a fill we keep getting that one.  We get the refillable theater cups every year to take advantage of the $1.00 refills too.  Another really good deal.  We try to get there real early so we can sit in a preferred area of the theater. I so wish everyone would arrive before the movie begins because there seems to be a constant flow of interruptions within the first 15 minutes of the movie with people in and out the door, standing in the aisle discussing where to sit, turning on their phones to create a flashlight.   Then you get the groups of people whose movie let out prior to the one you're watching.  These people come in and here we go through the whole thing again.  Like that they have a convenient ATM machine out front but dislike the fee.  Regular selection of hit movies, most of which are no longer at the high end theaters.  If you missed it there you've got a second chance to see it here and for less than half the price of a matinee.  Yeah this place is old and the seats aren't as luxurious as say Harkins, but this IS a bargain cinema.   I still like a bargain.  I really enjoy getting out to see a movie, and Tempe Pollack Cinemas is cheap and convenient. And you can bet I refer my friends, especially those with kids.

To the person from CA who posted in 2009... I'm sure organic was a lot more expensive in '09 simply because there were fewer businesses producing organic.  These days it's not unusual for the conventional baskets to contain a percentage or organic. I've volunteered since I first started. Produce varies based on the season, just like the grocery store.  By being familiar with what's actually in season can help you determine if you want to contribute or not.  But one of the neat things about BB is they frequently surprise me, still, by what I would call a rabbit out of the hat trick.  Something different or just plain unusual shows up.  I had never hear of Seckel Pears before I participated in BB.  I would never bring home Artichokes, Bok Choy, Oro Blancos, Daikon Radish, green Bananas, or Plantains.  Well the truth here is I wouldn't choose to bring home green bananas , still. It's a bargain to participate and the produce is more often than not, perfect.  If it is not, that would be the site coordinators fault. And like one other mentioned, volunteering even for BB is rewarding.  You get a little bonus of something extra to add to your basket and a chance to make a few friends too.

Since I'm not a big fan of pancakes I have to tell you this place makes some marvelous pancakes.  Made with real cream -you can taste the difference.  Deliciousness. And they're big too. This is a darn good breakfast place so if you come during regular breakfast hours on the weekend I'm pretty sure you're going to encounter a crowd as well as a wait. Servers are usually pleasant, skilled, and efficient.  Food coming out of kitchen seems to be consistent. Parking lot is iffy, but c'mon,  that seems to be the only bad. You want some tasty, comfort food?  Give this place a try.

Like Famous Daves since I first dined at one in Utah. They don't fill you up with peanuts or bread, just yummy, slow cooked bbq. Came here on this evening to take advantage of the birthday deal they send you when you sign up on their page.   I like the St. Louis Ribs cause they're meatier and jucier than the Baby Back Ribs.   Gimme some of that Devil Spit sauce and things are all good.

Shopping carts throughout the parking lot and in spaces where you want to park your car. It's after 800 am and the garden area is not open yet.  I don't get that.  Areas in garden are blocked off for an operating fork lift so I can't pick up garden plants.  :-(  Then I pay for my items and the only open registers are by the commercial area and this exit is at the opposite end of the main entrance.  Dislike.

Review based on drive thru experience and Green Chili Burrito only.   Good service in drive thru albiet occasionally slow and a delay acknowledging you even pulled up to order.   Delicious Green Chili Burrito.  Not too hot (spicy) and not so bland (BORING). The drive thru is sorta wonky cuz  1) it brings you alongside the front of a plaza where you would enter business(es) and 2) you could have a head in collision with someone entering the parking lot if you're not paying attention to where you're supposed to exit.  And I must say again, delicious Green Chili Burrito. (°  °) And the Chorizo Burrito is not greasy gross like the ones they give you at the Guadalupe & McClintock (Tempe) location.

The service was incredibly slow.  Granted, we had a relatively large party, maybe 12 total.  But some people didn't eat, some (three, maybe four?) had ordered well in advance of my arrival too. It took forEVER to get my margarita and I waited for her to take my order too. She seemed enthusiastic about us being there but the part about taking care of your table(s) must not be her priority. I waited as long for my food to come out of the kitchen as I did for her to actually see if I wanted to order. She never even asked if I wanted another cocktail or to have my water refilled.  The entree I ordered was the Scallops and Shrimp with pasta.  It was tasty too.  One scallop seemed to be on the undercooked side but overall I would say it was satisfactory.  Of couse I like Nigiri too so what doesn't bother me could be a real big issue for someone else.  The restaurant was SLOW.  I believe that there were maybe as many customers in the bar as there was in the restaurant. Guess that makes sense why my drink took so long but doesn't really explain why the rest of the service was "off".

General Tso Chicken, Steamed Pork Dumpling, free Egg Roll... Today adding Pineapple Chicken to the mix. It is all good.   I mean really, it is ALL good. Meal for one is more than enough for two hearty appetites.  Great way to share a couple meals with family/friends.

Been here a few times and like it for multiple reasons. 1.  Convenient 2.  Good food 3.  Good prices 4.  Most entrees are enough for two. 5.  They deliver. 6.  They have coupons right on their menu. 7.  Lunch specials. 8.  Polite staff.  And there are probably a few other things I may have overlooked. So thankful for the few people that originally posted reviews that brought me to this place.  Even the recommendation for General Tso Chicken was right on.

Been here maybe six or seven times since it's been here.  Rather tasty so I don't want to spoil a good thing. I've had breakfast and lunch items from the menu and so far it's all been rather tasty.  Update 5 12 13 Server Mike, the muffin does have raisins, and it shouldn't take longer than a couple minutes for you to bring it to the table. I guess you got a bad start when you decided to take the order from the table that was seated well after we had been seated. Hoping it improves. The NW corner table booth has the ac directed right on it.  Might be good to know during hot summer days.

Farmers markets here in AZ seem to be more of a craft fair.  Very limited in the produce department.  But what they do have is good and those working their booths are polite and helpful.  Like the tamales.  Tasty variety.  Parking was the pits, but it seems they've modified that situation a bit.

Been a regular here for more than ten years now.   We come by a few times a month usually for lunch or dinner but I also come with friends about once a week for a beer. I don't think of this location as a "dive bar" but more of a neighborhood restaurant.  I frequently see families with young kids dining at this establishment.  I used to say the Vine has the BEST french fries.  Lately they haven't been up to par AND they've been holding out.  Portions have decreased.    Most of the items on the menu are pretty good and they have set special every day of the week.  What I don't like about the Vine: *They charge for a ramekin of anything extra.  Really?  You have to charge me for buffalo sauce?   I swear it takes longer for them to approach the table, then you got another wait for them to bring the drinks.   I realize part of the fault could be the kitchen but the other delays are exclusively the server. We don't come here to watch the game or just drink a few beers, we come to enjoy a meal and then we our out of there.  Wish they had a better selection of beers on tap. Also wish they would put the races (drags) on when they're playing instead of multiple tvs playing assorted ball games.  Really, a little improvement with the service would be a welcome upgrade.

Glad to finally try this place.  The aroma of barbecue will make your mouth water if you're hungry.  The prices made me wonder why we hadn't come here sooner. Great combos and options that offer a sampling of more than one item on their menu. And did I mention cornbread?! Or for those that live dangerously, fried pickles. I got the slider combo of beef, pork, and chicken and it came with one side.  I opted for corn bread. Good stuff and big portions too.  I couldn't eat more than one slider.  My son let me taste his green chile mac and cheese.  Yummy stuff but the mac and cheese reminded me of KFCs mac and cheese -kinda processed tasting. Overall the food was tasty, selection good, and prices reasonable.

No wait inside but receiving our order seemed to take longer than necessary.  I asked about the Elliot & McClintock location and didn't get any info about that store bit did learn this location is moving East to Elliot & Priest around August/Spetember.

Good stuff.  Unusual, for me anyway, but always enjoy trying something different. I've never ordered anything from here but what they have on the shelves has been tasty and fresh. We've had breakfast or lunch her on a few occasions and that's good.  Nothing fancy though. One thing about this place is it's very small.  Like maybe two tables that seat four and maybe a two top too.

Starting off by saying this place is expensive.  Yeah, having a bathroom with a hand dryer is a perk, I'll admit that, but paying for a wash that doesn't really rinse your laundry (very visible soap suds during rinse cycle) and dryers that are unable to dry a t shirt in 16 minutes when set on high heat is ridiculous.  Four dollars ($4.00+) to dry a coverlet?!   Place is clean, but it is expensive and inefficient.

Great service and pleasant staff. I have gotten the stuffed cabbage every time I've been there now because it's something my husband would never eat if I did cook it at home. It's so good!  Maybe I'm hooked. Nice selection of desserts and gotta love that they have both beer and wine in individual size bottles. Double plus is the coupons I find online.  The only downfall to this place is that they close early. Yeah for the staff, boo for a customer with a late night craving for good East Coast style deli.

Tonight I had the special - pulled pork quesadilla.  It's the tortilla, pulled pork, green chiles and chess with a garnish of shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes. It was okay, but I think I prefer chicken or beef over the smokey flavor of pulled pork.  The french fries here are not good. And the burger apparently tasted like one of those patties you purchase in bulk at Costco.    Server wasn't bad. Beer options were okay. I understand the cocktail selection was pretty good because they had some of the most current liquors needed to make one of the latest cocktails.

Good location but parking is not ideal.  You can park at the pumps if you aren't opposed to annoying someone that wants to get gas.  Seems to be a common practice at many Circle K's.   Watch yourself here cuz too many drivers aren't paying much attention.  Almost got hit pulling into the driveway over the weekend.  Also saw one of the gas pumps had been crashed into a couple weeks ago so they had to tape off every pump so no gas was available.  I've come here on a few occasions and had to wait for coffee and one time I waited just so I could find someone to make the coffee.  Seems the "beeper" on the machine wasn't working. It seems more than one customer partially filled a cup and then left because the crock ran out.  Wouldn't you think they would notice that? No thanks for bringing to their attention that four urns -that's equivalent to 8-12 coffee pots folks - were empty.    In the past, at my regular location that is no longer open, if I had to wait for coffee they would give it to me for free.  C'mon, it's $0.96, so not a huge deal.  Oh yeah, and the 32 oz fountain drinks are back up to the regular price of $0.79 as of Monday.

Those big metal urns of coffee are cool.  Seriously, no more waiting for a single pot of coffee to be brewed cuz they have 8 huge urns.  And they have gotten it down so that it's a rare occurrence to have an urn empty.  Yay!  Two regular, a Cinnamon, probably one decaf and the rest of their usual flavors.  They also have a hot beverage machine that pours Hot Chocolate plus three other type of hot beverages.  Rewards gets you One free after you've purchased Ten.  That's alright.  Bring in your own cup and it costs ya just over a buck for a cup of coffee.  That is a good deal, especially on those 32° mornings.

Scott was extremely helpful, answering my myriad of random questions about the products and how do you determine which bed is right.  Very pleasant demeanor.  Knowledgeable about the product.  Was able to point me right to the product he determined would best suit our needs. Looking forward to delivery and getting it set up cuz we have been missing out on a good nights sleep for way too long.  Darn Select Number bed took a beating when our tree was struck by lightning and surged the outlet where the bed was plugged in, the doorbell, and our big screen TV.  Yep, all true. But that's not gonna happen with the new bed. Totally walked into this place just to look and walked out only after I was convinced that this was the best place to purchase a new mattress.  Sold!  Delivery is scheduled to happen early in the week.   Can't wait to switch from hammock to a bed once again.

It's like a gamble, sometimes you win big and sometimes nothing.  I think I'm hooked.  Sometimes I drop in just to see what there is. I used to be anti thrift store cuz I never found anything decent, but now that I go more routinely I have had some success in the "finds" area. An awesome chaise that numerous friends want, shoes I've picked up for a friend in N. CA, purse that turned me onto a brand that's made in LA -that means Made in the USA!  Great shoes that I'm guessing just didn't work out for the previous owner, stuffed toys for my dogs, comforters for my car -because of the dogs, my kids fixation on books means we can fill the need for even less than what I would pay at Changing Hands.  It took some time but clearly I am a fan.

Took myself cuz I didn't feel I was getting better.  Pleasant front desk staff, minimal paperwork (Yeah!!!), and not a long wait. I wish they had earlier hours but at least they don't close at 5:00 pm. Good experience as far as a visit to the doctors office could ever be.

Well generally food is good.  Service is about the same here, not particularly special but they get you out the door without much hassle.  This occasion was not the norm, other than the music so loud you can't communicate without repeating everything or just deciding "whatever".  Well this evening the little, skinny dude behind the counter didn't like me asking why I couldn't get an extra item on the side so I could determine how much I wanted to put on my sandwich so he offers the sarcastic "Have a good night" comment.  Had to let him know I was having a good night and that his personality really glistened, like the stuff on a pooper scooper.

Delicious options here.  I visit the counter most frequently here and service is typically exceptional.  Fantastic prices on bagels and toppings are generous too.  I go out of my way to eat a Chompies bagel.  I spent years at a first job at a bagel shop back East and I know a good bagel.  They know a good bagel here too.  They also know good deli.  Yes!  Pastrami on rye, and so many more items to help make the decision difficult.

Alright, my first job was in a bakery where we sold the most popular doughnuts in town so I think I have a decent idea of what is a 'good' doughtnut.  I can only imagine that those who like these just haven't eaten doughnuts anywhere other than Krispy Kreme.   Mostly raised doughnuts, primarily the glazed variety.  Small, greasy flavor and barely anything inside the filled doughnuts.  Not worth the money for the selection of mediocre.  You want a delicious doughnut? Check out the neighborhood Basha's grocery stores.  Their filled doughnuts are filled.  Custard, creme, raspberry, cherry, sometimes apple too.  They have apple, cherry and blueberry fritters.  Their buttermilk sticks are twice the size of the ones they sell at BoSa.  The selection included cake and the raised variety. AND on Fridays you get a half dozen free when you buy a dozen.   I'm sticking with the area Basha's.  Yum.

Had been here once before when it first opened and was not impressed.  Small portions + big prices turned me away. Today i thought i had a coupon for this place bit apparently there is a different Biscuits in Mesa.  We were seated, place was busy, figured we might a s well stay. Our server was slow to greet but in every other way she was polite and efficient.  Probably one of the best servers we have had in a long time.  Thank you Lisa! I had the biscuit & gravy entree with eggs, bacon and grits.  Grits were a bit too salty/buttery, but still alright. Son had South Mountain Scramble and said it was pretty good except for the little bit of burnt ham that shouldnt have been in it. Overall it was tasty and pleased we tried it here again.

Okay, besides there being an occasional wait -weekends/breakfast/holiday, this place is consistent.  Wait typically isn't too long, hostess is quick to recognize new guests, customers are called several times until located and the promptly seated.  Waitresses are usually quick to approach table for beverage order and if not, the busboys serve as efficient backups and assist with getting the table started.  Coke products at this location.  Did I mention that yet?  And the waitresses are good about making sure you have something in you glass/cup to drink.  Biscuits are good.  Sausage links, no patties here, are okay if you like that stuff. I'm used to Bob Evans or Jimmy Dean sausage so most restaurant sausage doesn't taste good to me. Bacon, crispy CRISPY.  I like mine on the rare and wiggly side so no bacon for me. Ham is okay. The Polish sausage is on the greasy side but has good flavor.   Chicken fried steak is hearty, crisp, and smothered well with gravy which compliments it nicely. Potatoes are the shredded hash browns or the cubed type which I think are the O'Briens or country fries. Grits are buttered but I think they're yummy.  Nothing like grits, biscuits and gravy, and  chicken fried steak to make you feel that your were born and raised in the South. In this case, living close to South Mountain.    One last thing. They have a fish fry on Fridays so they're open for dinner.

I don't do happy hour anymore so it was nice to just kinda stumble upon this place.  Decent drink specials along with a menu of tasty appetizers. A few bites of various items on the menu and we were happy campers.  The decor is fabulous.  I was wishing they were a little closer to where I live because I would go there more often. The restrooms were, interesting.  I got a chuckle out of passing through the shared washroom but thought it was rather ingenious -less space needed and thus more room to seat more customers.  ;-)   Saw even more to appreciate as we were leaving through the patio.    We decided then we would be back.

Well of course I'm a fan.  I mean really, who's not?!  I dig that I can find an occasional DEAL on yelp so there's an additional plus. Location is convenient -almost too convenient.   Love the trivia question although most of the time I do get it wrong. The staff is ALWAYS polite, friendly and helpful.  HELLO!  Anyone listening?  Good customer service does exist, but you have to be purchasing ice cream at this location.    BR should be my BFF.

Been coming to Andrea for several years now.  Shes generally able to work me into her schedule, occasionally trims my son's hair in between processing and cut/style.   She's worked with me and all my special requests.  Nothing extreme but certainly not the 'norm'.   She's willing to get me product I can't find elsewhere too. I would say she's up on all the current styles, capable of bringing out the best in those vintage styles your gramma wears, and creative enough to incorporate something unusual without making it appear weird or just wrong. Of course this review is coming from a "mature", adult woman that realizes my hair will grow out and I can do it all over again OR go in a totally different direction next time. So now she's the business owner and I am thrilled to support a local business, a small business owner, and the local economy.

Quaint set up.  ALMOST reminds me of HOT (my personal fave).  Menu items look good and there's a good variety. Newspaper on hand to read which I really like.  Courtyard/patio dining, with misters, option.  Very limited seating indoors. I had the pulled pork and it was fantastic. I will be back.

Great food. I just can't believe that as long as we've lived in the area we only recently began dining here.  It's in a strip mall and I've known long enough that many of the really good restaurants really do occupy spots in strip malls.  So why did it take us so long? Well I can tell you the reason we did finally come here is because the sushi place across the road had no vacant tables and I wasn't going to stand where there was no lobby or seating and wait for a table.   So Yelp and my fellow Yelpers to the rescue. This was the closest restaurant open and we're typically game for trying something new.  And here we are today. Happy customers and we keep coming back to enjoy original favorites and trying new things too.  They haven't disappointed us yet. Polite staff, good service (sorry but I don't like a server to gravitate over me before I have a chance to taste my food, nor do I need them checking on me with every bite -they don't ignore or avoid your table and they're not outside smoking or gabbing at a bus stations), great selection, delicious options, FAST to go -you don't need to call in if you're not opposed to waiting like five to ten minutes.  The cook is fast.  The rice is always moist and sticky.   We've done the lunch buffet and personally, I don't like buffet, but this was good.  It was later in the afternoon and she was ready to break it down but allowed us to decide if we wanted to order of the menu or eat from the buffet.  It was alright, even with it being later in the afternoon.  The Sesame Chicken was my favorite.  I had never had it before and when we ate here next it was one of the entrees we ordered.   The vegetables in each dish have been fresh and colorful.  The meats varied quite a bit based on the dish.   This place inspires me even more to try different (unusual to me) things on the menu so I always ask for both menus. I was considering the chicken and salted fish option but went with Beef Bok Sum -simple dish.  Maybe next time I'll try the fresh fish.

Nice theater with some nice little perks. Seating is comfy but the seats aren't really deep enough to really relax because you can't really recline in these chairs without propping your foot on the seat in front of you.  I know they are similar to the seats at Harkins but they are not the same. Since you are sitting through the entertainment it is important to be comfortable. I liked the concession AND cafe option.  The sandwich and hummus was pretty good.  Really wish they had an option to purchase a cup and get inexpensive refills for the year.  Saves on waste and you get a real idea who your loyal customers are.  Will probably go back again to take advantage of the specific event but I remain true to Harkins Theaters.  ;-)

You come inside, stand in a line to pay a cashier about $12 per person (does not include drink), and then stand in a different line so someone can tell you where to sit. I constantly ask Why?!  Why pay that kinda money when you can go to a restaurant where you'll be seated and given a menu, place an order, served, checked on, and then dishes cleared from your table instead of dishes gathering -and all for the same price. Yes, I realize you get so much more variety, but the quality??? In case you haven't picked up on this yet I am not a fan of Chinese buffet -anywhere.   Quality is always sub par and price just seems to cover the excessive waste and not actual product.   Oysters are dry, over cooked, and some are so bad I had to remove from my mouth. Shrimp is over done.  Baby octopus were whole.  That was interesting. My husband and son said the bread is really good. Lmao.  You gonna make bread your meal at a buffet? More often than not my husband and I could split an entrée and still have leftovers, if we could ever agree on eating the same thing.  So variety IS good, but for me this place just doesn't seem to do a single thing on their buffet really well.   Unless it's the bread my son and husband seem to like.

Very polite staff. Donuts are okay I guess -I'm kinda partial to those sold at a grocery store bakery so what do you expect? Coffee is good, ice coffee is really good. Nice, clean, and easily accessible location.  I believe they even have a drive through here.

Business hours are posted 8-5 but they were closed when I drove past. I called and got an answer on the fourth ring but was told they weren't open on Wednesday "this week".  Dislike they have hours posted as open but drive across town and learn they are routinely closed during regular operating hours. Also could see by reviewing on Yelp the only check it was the business owner.

I like to fuel up here cuz it's usually one of the lowest prices on this side of the Valley.  Use my Shell Rewards and I save an additional .03¢.  And IF I have Fry's Rewards I can save a minimum of .10¢.   And the option of a well priced soft drink.  :]  Entrance can be a challenge.  Gas pumps have limited area so that adds to the challenge -and the reward of a good price.  Ha!

Mark's Cafe, overall, is good but it's not great.  The wait wasn't so bad, hospitality is positive, service is okay, food is good, water seems like unfiltered tap, and table cleanliness was questionable. I like the location.  Parking isn't such a challenge, atmosphere is simple, dining area wasn't overly crowded. Staff greeted us very positively and made us feel welcome. We waited for a table to be cleaned once a party left and were then allowed seat ourself. Menu has a promising selection but seems a tad overpriced.  I didn't realize the going rate was $2.45 for a fountain soda.  I'll stick with water. Had to wait for server to take our order, and it was a bit of a wait for our food to make it to our table as well.  Wait would have been less of an issue IF our food had all come out together.   The potatoes had a bit too much herbs and spices for our morning palate I guess.  They entree itself was tasty.  It's Sunday, first I heard Christmas music but then the Christmas music seemed to transition into Christian music. Christian music I guess is not a problem on a Sunday but I guess this occurs every day of the week there. Overall it was okay but the reviews lead me to believe it was much more. May go back but no huge draw.

It's difficult to be a fan of the DMV. No matter what day you go there a line has formed at the entrance before they've opened.  You go inside and there's a line throughout the day. You get a number and then stand in another line. Staff is cordial at best.

What do you do when you order one thing and bring home something different? The Pick 2 Combo of an Adult Grilled Cheese came home looking like a plain grilled cheese. It is 830 when I walked in and they don't close until 9 p.m.  You would've thought it was 855 p.m. cuz they had everything put away and was working hard on clearing the rest. She couldn't even find the cookies that go with the sandwich orders. Yeah um, don't come into a restaurant to order food during business hours.

Parking lot is somewhat small and seems poorly laid out based on the way people had parked.  Just seemed like too many cars were incapable of maneuvering between the painted lines.   Restaurant looks fairly large and buffet tables are visible upon entering. There is a meeting room in the back which we used for a club meeting. Didn't seem as if they were even prepared for our group to be there. Rugs were in a pile in the corner of the room and the floor was stick gross.  My shoes were stuck and made noise each time I lifted a foot.  Annoyingly gross. Tables were basic conference type tables with napkin holder and soy sauce bottles strategically placed. I think they could do a little more to make this a very useful meeting area and potentially create a better draw.  Start by mopping the floors would be a good place to start.   I did not eat.  Food smelled alright but I'm not very fond of buffet Chinese and I just feel sushi doesn't belong on any buffet.

I didn't know what to expect but had hoped that with a name like "garlic & shots" that maybe it was going to be fun and creative.  The $5.00 off coupon stuck under the windshield wiper window was the deciding factor.  Hostess was overly enthusiastic about seating us.   Chairs look like banquet chairs that had a cover over them.  Nicely done.  There's a lit, glass display case in the dining area that contains spent bottles of wine and champagne.  I would suggest they dispose of those bottles and find some theme for tchotchkes and/or floral arrangements to display in the case to add a little more ambiance to the room.  Printed menu on a 8 1/2" x 11" paper included appetizers, salads (?), and three entrees.  Another piece of paper was handed to us with todays specials -Fish & Chips and a Salmon entree.  Wine selection was okay. Ordered a glass and had already begun to drink it when server asks if we would like to try some shots.   Wine with shots, no thank you.  No salt or pepper on any of the tables, but we were asked if we wanted it.  How do we know if we haven't had a chance to taste our food?! Was served a bullet of ketchup when requesting some for my fries.  Not all servers are knowledgeable about their products on the menus.  Our server picked up our coupon but didn't apply it to our bill.  When I inquired about the discount he asked if we told the hostess.   Our transaction needed to be voided and rerun with the discount.  Music sounded like Muzak until live musician started performing in the bar.  He played one song and then excused himself for a few so he could find the right balance (I forgot exactly what he said) for the room.  He played a few bars and sang a few phrases of various songs and then I believe he resumed his set.  MIGHT give them another chance.

It's ooooookay, but I don't think we'll be going back, especially with Rudy's right across the street.   I didn't want to compare the two but it has become our go to for BBQ.  No hostess to greet or give direction or guidance to first timers.  Dislike.  It started out a tad confusing.  The method in which you order is almost like a cafeteria.  Kinda like Souper Salad or Bonanza (remember Bonanza?)  Seems awkward.  Maybe that's because of the service that was behind the counter. Came here for linner  (late lunch/early dinner) and we both went with the #3 combo.  Carnitas and tri tip, mustard greens, jalapeno corn bread, corn on the cob, and peach cobbler for me, sausage and Carnitas, green beans, jalapeno corn bread, corn on the cob, and blackberry cobbler for my son. Method used to weigh meat was questionable.  Both Carnitas and tri tip had too much fat on meat.  Corn was soggy. Other veggies were mediocre. Son wanted to leave as soon as we were done eating because he said he smelled formaldehyde.  I know a few friends like this place better than the competition across the street but that's fine with me cuz that just means fewer people in line to order -at Rudy's.

Okay, generally good food and pleasant service overall. Tonight it was not that.   No baskets for the peanuts in either of the boxes.  I asked if they had any and they eventually put some in one of the boxes. Order placed was slow in delivery.   Three orders came in after the order I placed, with minutes in between, and I watched them get called and leave the building well before my order was ready. My order:  one (1) small burger, plain, and one cheeseburger with catsup,  mushrooms, grilled onion, jalapenos and one medium french fry.  In case you hadn't heard before,  they are known for their large fry orders. I got home to a small fry and my receipt shows i did pay for the medium size which is supposed to be enough for 2 - 3 people.  I also asked for nutrition information at the same time I was placing my order and the person taking my order showed me a card with what comes ON the sandwiches but was unsuccessful finding one so she asked another guy (the manager?!) behind the counter.  While he's scavenging to find one she walks to the other register to help another customer.  Not once does he acknowledge me or say anything to me about never seeing them in the store but he is digging around at the front counter just like she had done. I ask if I can just pay for my order and that It'll be okay if they can put the brochure with my burgers to go.  He completes the payment transaction and then promptly disappears to the back room.   So now I've waited for my order I ask again about the nutrition information brochure because there's nothing there.  Guy (manager?!)  once again disappears to scavenge for one, without saying a thing like "ill be right back, i couldnt find one, maybe look online"...,  -nothing.   A girl follows him into the back room after I ask IF they actually have them or am I standing just around waiting for the fries get cold.  She returns a few minutes later to tell me they don't have any. The other questions i asked of the two that were at the counter went in one ear and out the other.  They looked at me as if to acknowledge my question but turned and walked back to pull napkins.  I was surprised to the point of shaking my head and laughing at the situation. FWIW, I picked up son and hubbies food here and got myself a sandwich at Jimmy Johns.  Had much better service there too.  Oh yeah Five Guys, way to represent.

Great prices, delicious options. Two sause options, both of which were really tasty.  The bottles on the other hand and the dispenser top were lame but it works. I liked the sample before you decide option.  You come in and if this is your first time they allow you to sample a few of the meats before you decide.  Great opportunity to taste before you order. So many great tasting meat options too.  I like the moist beef brisket which is well marbled.  Unfortunately sometimes it has more marbling (fat) that I would prefer. You get what you pay for here.  Meat is cut and weighed and charged accordingly.

Small parking lot with an entrance that flows right into the drive thru line depending on time of day.  Problem is if people in drive thru dont hug the curb you can't get around them to park.  Almost as soon as you enter the parking lot from the East you will arrive at the drive thru order board.  If you're not familiar with this place you will completely miss your option to order. Parking is very limited to less than twenty spots. Menu isn't too complicated and really not much out of he ordinary. They have symbols beside every item that denotes vegetarian, gluten free, dairy free, protein packed, and balanced. Both entrees we ordered fell into the protein category. My sandwich was pretty good and only wish i could have had my eggs cooked to order.  I had a bite of my sons frittata and that was nummy and i will probably order it next time. Patio has more seating than there is inside.  Music is eclectic with jazz, funk, and a rap blended in which provides a more hip, youthful feel to the place -not that you need any more youthful and hip in an area that is so close to the college.  *g* Overall a decent change of pace and will probably come back again so i can try the frittata.

More than I imagined here and 10 times better than that $1.00 Store associated with Wal Mart.  Sure they have plenty of things Made in China but they also have some quality products too.  Veggies, dairy items, and much more. This is a big store. And to think I only came here looking for those bags that extend the life of produce.

I could have printed the completed form off and brought it in but didn't understand that was an option cuz this was the first time applying.  But fwiw the ladies here were polite and helpful in getting me pointed in the right direction. The expedited process is supposed to take between two and three weeks.  I hope that pans out ahead of schedule since I'm headed out of town at that three week mark. Want to say parking right along Arizona Avenue made accessing this place so much easier (quicker) than using the parking garage.  For some, parallel parking is not a learned -or mastered skill, so maybe they should park elsewhere because there is traffic going by this parking area.  One of the other options is the parking garage which does provide covered parking -SHADE, almost a must in the hot summer months.  So even those it's maybe a block away at least you can park without testing your parking skills  ---too much. Keep in mind, parking garage is like many others and high profile parking isn't going to work here. There is a lot right across the street.  And all three locations are FREE!

Good location, but not really accessible if you're headed East on Elliot. Parking lot is often full and parking is limited. Good, fresh coffee. Store typically clean and fairly busy too.

Dated furniture and nick knacks that aren't old enough to be cool.  Some decent shoes and clothes available, just depends on your luck.  Lots of trendy purses, belts, scarves.  In an effort to run this place like some high end store, or maybe some obsessive compulsives house, they tell you to leave your have food or drink at the door.  LOL!  How old are we?!  Um, with BR on the corner I like to browse while I eat my cup of  one scoop of ice cream.   They shoo'd me and my guest out of the store once, person wasn't very polite and there was not a no food/drink sign posted on the door.  Now seriously, this isn't a department store it's a consignment store.  They pay a small pittance on items you bring them to sell. Similar items can be found at a thrift store as well.

Ah yes, I remember when this place used to be the original Pleasant Croissant.  Like a bleached white hole in the wall bakery with croissants so perfectly wonderful that they sold out almost every day well before noon.   Not we have the Crepe Bar occupying this suite.  An interesting addition to the neighborhood and an intriquing option I felt the need to try, at least once.   After reading reviews and then scanning the menu we decided to share a savory and a sweet crepe from the menu.  Darn good too. May not be worth the price for he papa k with egg.  A three egg omelette will cost you about that much, with toast and hash browns. But this was a welcome change from the usual and darn near ideal for the weather and the day. Will be coming back again to try one of the other options on the menu.  Hopefully soon. I think the yelp symbol for price range should be $$... I guess I'm sort of a fan but I don't anticipate becoming a regular at this place.  Prices just didn't seem reseaonable for the options available. Also, the first time we came in there were no crepes because of an event the were participating in or something.  That wasn't so good. ONLY because of the location did we decide to give this place another try.

I've used this place fairly regularly.  Generally it's alright.   They "upgraded" to include an option in which you can scan a credit or debit instead of dropping like 50 quarters to wash your car.  I think that's a plus. I washed my beast completely and had moved on to the Spot Free Rinse and what should have been water came out as a foam.  I thought it was the pressure combined with chemicals needed to make it spot free,  but it wasn't starting to dry spot free.  In fact I had soap streaks completely covering my washed and rinsed vehicle.   My vehicle is huge  so this is not a small issue.  It takes more time and more money to get it all clean. My clock ticked down as I went to find the employee that was working.  You know he's not gonna make himself visible when ya need some help. I covered most of the lot looking for him and went back to the office where I had to BUZZ the office until someone appeared. He walks over with me to the stall and says something like let's check it out. Puts a few quarters in and runs the sprayer, which is still sett on spot free rinse, at the ground until it starts to run clear.  Hands it to me and says there ya go. ??? I don't know why it appeared to be working right them but not when I had paid. Well anyway, I finish that,spot free rinse again and pay $2 to go through the dryer. Arrive home less than 15 minutes later and I see streaks covering my vehicle.  WTH?! I'm too tired to go back there right now. Annoyed I took the time to get it cleaned so that darn bird poop was off the hood only to drive away with it looking just as bad as when I got there.

Sorry Rita but I've been spoiled by real frozen custard. Even the burger chain with the frozen delicacies is a few notches up the ladder but still doesn't rank with my favorite local frozen custard. But to hear your staff has no clue what makes a frozen custard really isn't a big surprise once you understand it all comes from premade mixes.    Gotta say your location is a good one though.  At the edge of a strip mall, visible from the road.   Seems like a great way to lure 'em in. And the table and benches outside are a nice touch.  I didn't have the Gelati but it did remind me of something we used to get years ago.  Maybe DQ had something like it made with slush and ice cream.  Can't exactly recall, but it brought back yummy memories from 20+ years ago. May have to try that here.

I was going to give three stars because its  chicken fingers and French fries.  I decided this place deserves only two stars because they have only four items in the menu -oh, five if you count the kids meal.  Chicken fingers -quality.  Two thumbs up. French fries -okay, but not great. Cole slaw -no clue cuz I gave mine to hubby. Texas toast - short and thick white bread that's been toasted or grilled and it is white bread good.  The special sauce that even they can't describe. I would have preferred Ranch dressing, or Devils Spit BBQ sauce, or blue cheese dressing, or mustard or Catsup. It just wasn't very good.  I did feel it was nondescript.  It's all okay but not good enough to bring me back anytime soon.

Something's were appealing, like ground beef for $1.88 lb in what appeared to be a 10lb roll.  That's a bargain I can't find anywhere else.   The bulk items are kind of a turn off.  Here I'm thinking people are sticking their hands in to nosh on a few goodies and sure enough, some guy sticks his hand in and pulls out two gummy candies.  Clearly he is mentally challenged and couldn't read the "DO NOT...." sign that's applied to every few barrels.   I was surprised by the variety of products they carry.   There was what appeared to be a massive selection of coffee on the wall but I didn't get a close up view. I picked up some Greek yogurt, Bolthouse Farms beverage, Kefir, and a couple other items which were priced much lower than any of the other Valley grocery stores.  Not knowing the types of meat cuts and prices I couldn't compare WinCo to any of the area grocery stores.   Overall feeling, I am not going out of my way to shop here.  I I was also surprised to learn they have limited payment options too.

I go for the garden area, so that means I enter and exit the garden area.  Now what I don't understand is their garden gates don't open until 8 a m, regardless of the season.   In the Spring and Summer months the seasonal  annuals and perennials out front are frequently dry, wilted or dying.  Isn't there some sort of job requirement like the most basic garden experience required?  Dried up, over watered plants, plants that have been grown in a greenhouse or a climate unlike ours are put in direct sun and fried to a crisp.  And these people are supposed to be a source of information when I have questions about a plant or planting something?!  Can you tell me why the overhead watering system is turned on when entry gates are opened.  Especially when the gates don't open until 8?  That folks is how most Home Depot garden centers seem to operate.

Called this morning at 826 am and was told I would have a technician out between 12 and 2 pm.  Tech called at 1232 and said he'd be here in approximately 15 minutes. The tech arrived and promptly went to work. He came across an aftermarket starter switch and some wiring that didn't make sense. Not once did he talk down about the other company we used. Was glad he made it out, had the required parts and was able to fix the situation in a timely manner. My questions were answered and he took the time to explain the hows and whys the breakdown occurred. Yelp reveiwers came through once again.  Thanks so much.

Took advantage of the Happy Hour deals and glad we did.  Sampled a little of almost every category on the menu.  Fantabulous.   Becca Roll, Dragon Roll, Unagi Sashimi, Calamari Steak, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and Green Tiger cocktails.  Delicious. We will be back -hopefully again soon.

Management here is slacking. It's visible in the parking lot and inside the store. What a slob of a location.  Want dates and times?  In this area you would expect better.  I certainly expected room in an outside garbage cannister to put a disposable cup but nope, no room there, because it was over flowing.  And this trashed look followed me from the gas pumps to inside the store. WTH, I know your third shift (?) employee(s) do almost nothing, and this was clear proof too. Hey, why do some work when you can just let the next shift do it -and that person is there alone during the busier hours of the day.  I was just surprised by such a mess that I couldn't even put any focus on wth happened inside the store.

Well they weren't open.... I've gone by here multiple times and keep saying I need to see if they have anything good.  Well time was permitting so I pulled into the back parking lot, parked my vehicle and went to the rear entrance -the only entrance... Door was locked but a gentleman opened and helped me to understand they're ONLY open on Fridays and Saturdays. So I suppose I'll need to be going back soon.

How can you go wrong with a beneficial program like this? For a $10 contribution you can haul away up to 60 pounds of produce.  If you go to the I-17/Rose Garden Ln location there may be additional items besides just produce.  I have brought home things to share with family and friends, items that can be canned/frozen, things for the beastlies (Danes), as well as treats for my hens and even the waste gets gobbled up by my compost pile and the invasive hens.  Liking this program. Wish it was year round in our area so I wouldn't have to drive across town to participate.

Dined on the patio with friends on this one particular evening. One waitress was nice enough but  service was slow, or intentionally ignored us on multiple occasions.  It's possible she was tending to tables inside as well as the other two that were outside but I had gone inside and I believe I only saw customers at the bar.  Who knows.   Beer selection was good.  Prices on the beers and the size of the pour varied based on the alcohol content of the beer.  That's new to me. Happy Hour menu was okay, but the actual items was less than okay.  Pretzel was blah.  I can't believe I even ordered it for what it cost.  The tacos were interesting and when I couldn't identify what exactly was on those tacos I asked the server and she didn't appear to know although she had told us they're her favorite. She also delivered a beverage to our table that was not what had been ordered.  She passed the blame onto the bartender but in reality she could have seen it was incorrect if she had actually looked because it is visibly different.  There was a table of customers with multiple canines creating a ruckus on that evening.  Terriers sparring and such.   I generally think of people that bring their dogs to places that allow them tend to have pets that have had some training and will settle down peacefully.    This isn't going to be a go to place for me.

Registered with this business more than a year ago and got an email for an opportunity to "audition". My impression was this is more like a bait and set up.  They lure you in and if your animal doesn't perform to the owners level of acceptance you are then given you information for someone they work with who can give your dog obedience lessons and then they imply after which you will be put in their files for future consideration. The standards in which they test vary from one dog to the next.  The person that sent the email extending to me the opportunity had made assumptions about my dogs temperament . They allowed an owner to run their dog in an agility area while asking for specific behaviors, but they did not give any information about the location, environment, activity, or anything of location.  You're simply asked to come. All of these things made it look like they're drumming up business for someone else and in turn getting some kind of a return on any business sent that way.

First -I don't know where all the previous reviews have gone because I've reviewed this place AT LEAST twice since the location actually opened.  That was about a couple years ago now.  Service here has gone downhill, or else they just have better employees with more social skills and customer service skills at different times of the day.  Seriously folks, I went in there to place a to go order and Dana and a couple guys at the counter just stare at us.  No one said, "what can we start for you?" or "how can I help you?" -NOTHING. So since they just stood there in a state of stupor, and I knew already one menu item that I needed to order I siimply told them.  It did seem to register because I was finally asked "half or full?"... Then she asks if it's for here or to go and I told her to go. My guest gave them his order, and then I had a difficult time making up my mind about what I wanted when it occured to me that the last sandwich I had here was one that had roast beef on it.  So I figured I would ask how much roast beef is on that specific sandwich.   Fortunately the manager (?) is nearby and after I repeat the question again I get an answer. I decide on my sandwich and after all of that I am still seeing gapping mouths and blank stares from everyone, except the manager type person, that's behind the counter. Seriously, because I asked a trick question or something?  Da-yum, my behavior threw them for a loop.  Oy vay kiddos, I already knew we were gonna have problems in the future but just didn't realize how bad it would be.  Hmmm, thinking I'm gonna make a call.

YUM! So glad I made the decision to give this place a try.  Tasty, satisfying, fresh, reasonably priced, and a couple of really great guys behind the counter.  Theses two are providing guidance and info about the food, directing to the best place for menu viewing, taking the orders, and cooking it up to order. Did I say FRESH?  The fish was fresh and tasty and the light batter was very complimentary, not a lot of fluffy filler.   The salsa/condiment bar was far from what you might typically see (Baja Fresh, America's Taco Shop, etc.).  Not to say anything bad about any of those but this one is just different.  Loved the cilantro sauce and the hot habanero salsa.  You can choose between chopped cabbage or a (dry) slaw as one of your toppings too.  But really, what's a fish taco without cabbage?   And let me tell you, their version of tartar sauce is not what you might expect either -creamy, light, refreshing compliment to the fish.  Wish I could just order the first alone just so I could enjoy some of their tartar sauce with.  They also have a hot oil.   Interesting.   I went with the Full and and one other.  Forgot to get pics cuz i was hungry and anxious to try these.  My son had the Gobernador and Campechana.  I tasted his quesadilla and give it two thumbs up.  We were very satisfied with our choices and glad we decided on this place for lunch. We will be back.

Overall, good service.  Our server was patient and offered guidance in making my decision. This evening the restaurant was fairly empty except for the large party that was there celebrating a child's (?) Birthday. After we finally decided on what we were having and ordered I realized they actually close fairly early.  Eight p.m. seems like an early hour to close. Our dinners were delivered moments after our beverages had been dropped off and they looked so good.  Mmm.  One of the items delivered was actually not what had been ordered.  She brought two (2) of the Tortas del Ray and one was a tally supposed to be an omelette.   It was discussed and then decided it would be consumed instead of sending it back and waiting for the correct entree to be made . All of it was tasty. And it was just too much.   So of course we had to split the Esquimo.  I honestly can't recommend one thing because the few times I've dined here I've always had something different and they've all been really good. So I would suggest you be adventurous, try something new.

Alright, here's the facts.  Pizza place with tasty pizza, fresh toppings, and yummy crust.  Ice cold beer on tap - and now they have Four Peaks Kilt Lifter.  Ahhh!  They can dump the others for all I care.   Staff is ALWAYS nice and it makes it a pleasure coming in.  I don't mind having a beer while I wait for our order. It is a family environment which has its highs and lows.  Seems it doesn't matter what day or what time you come there are kids here with their families.  Yes families.  Plural.   So sometimes it's screeching loud and little kids running about.  C'mon parents.   Multiple TVs on all walls playing sports or the latest, overplayed current event(s). So they do have other menu options besides pizza but I've only had the pizza and wings and quite honestly the wings were just mediocre. There's also bottled beer, wine (cough cough -sad attempt but I have seem some people with a glass.  White, white Zin (gag-fyi, this is Koolaid, not wine), and a red.), and Coca Cola products -Hurray for Coke!!!  Oh and I hadn't mentioned this yet -Udi Gluten Free pizza crust.  I was told it only comes in the small size though. So pizza, wings, appetizers aka salads bread, kids menu, desserts, beverages, booths and tables, kids play area complete with kids television programs and arcade games.... What did I omit? Hmm. Oh yeah, they have GREAT pizza.   Nom Nom Nom

Upon parking we see a trailer, empty boxes on the sidewalk, extra booth/chairs outside the bar door and one of those huge linen carts where you toss the dirty laundry. Entering the restaurant it was kind of dark but the bar was well lit and set for what appeared to be a private party. The hostess greeted us and ushered us to a table,  in the dark.  Since it was our first time and we do wear readers I asked for a table where there was actually some light that was good enough for us to actually see the menu.  She joked, that's what cell phones are for.   So she does seat us in one of the many vacant tables with sufficient light and we are promptly greeted by a cheerful waitress.  What was her name? We discussed Margaritas and after a second trip to the table, and the use of the flashlight on my phone, we were able to make our decision.  A Cadillac for me and the Skinny for hubby.  They have a $100 Margarita that reads it's served in a medium glass and I guess you get a free tshirt with it. Sad to say but Zipps Zipparitas have more flavor and alcohol than the drinks we were served. Chips and salsa were served and we were given the lowdown on the three varieties of salsa. The most generic salsa was bland, the hot red was just chunky and kind of bland, and the green which was supposedly the hottest was lacking depth and really not hot either. I just thought all the salsas lacked distinguishable flavor. For dinner I decided to try the Chile Relleno BECAUSE I thought it was actually going to contain meat of choice. Nope, my dish arrived and the meat was put onto the plate and the Chile Relleno was placed on top.  The Chile Colorado was good but greasy and the pepper itself didn't taste like a Hatch Chile. Everything was sprinkled with cheese. The calabacita veggie blend tasted like they were pulled out of the freezer and just boiled. The sopapilla was tasty and we all agreed that it was probably the best part of the meal, but sadly nowhere near as delicious as those I've had elsewhere.  Wish Garduno's was still in the East Valley.   Overall the food was quite bland, lacking distinguishable flavor of each item that went into preparing the various dishes. I like a salsa where I can actually taste the ingredients that go into making it -tomatoes, jalapenos, onions, garlic, cilantro.   Gimme something that is HOT AND flavorful.  It is possible to have both together.  I felt the food here was bland, missing the slightest amount of flame from any peppers and lacked flavor.  The tequila selection was interesting but that's not a good enough reason to go back for the food, or a Margarita ftm.

Since being told about this place it has become a favorite shopping location for livestock supplies aka chicken feed.  To think I drove around the Valley less than a year ago to find food grade diatomaceous earth  (DE), hitting up garden supply and pool supply shops.  Here I can get a 50 lb bag anytime.  In case you weren't aware DE is a safe and natural form of pest control. Okay, enough about de.   They have chicks and ducklings too.   Nice selection of boots, grills, tack, tools, house cleaning supplies, tools for garden and yardwork, feeds, bee keeping supplies, assorted canning suppiies, vintage style soda pops, western attire for work or play, and much more. It's huge, and it's spacious. Staff is knowledgeable and seem very helpful too. Yeppers, I am a fan.

The burgers vary greatly but they're so delicious.  I never would have thought I would like a mushroom burger.  And no way am I gonna like a chicken burger.    Well I was proven wrong.  The mushroom burger was my absolute favorite followed closely by the Ahi burger and the Continental (chicken).  The beef hamburger didnt seem nearly as appealing to my palate as the mushroom or Ahi tuna burgers. French fries with a truffle aoli will give you a new found appreciation (truth here -it could be love) for French fries.    Salads are delicious, fresh, combinations of the season.   The taste of summer watermelon in a salad of baby kale.  Fantastic. Sodas from Maine that are made with pure can sugar and natural favors instead of a lot of dyes and chemicals.  Kinda makes you feel like a kid again.  BTW, i hear the blueberry soda ( yeah, bet you've never heard of that before) actually tasted like real blueberries.   And then there are some special cocktails and deliciously tempting shakes that are unique to this place too.   And the service is impressive.  The staff is knowledgeable of the menu items including the ingredients of each.   Food is delicious and different.  Service is polite, knowledgeable,  and efficient. AND prices are comparable to places like Fuddruckers. I'm already planning to bring my family here.

Cheery guys working tonight.  All were courteous and helpful.  One wanted us to come back in a half hour to give us a coupon cuz he thought we were dissatisfied with service because register wasn't printing receipts and all I was wanting was an address so I could add them to Yelp.  ;-) Unfortunately I was unable to make it back there cuz I had to take hubby some gas for his vehicle.  Oh, what I didn't like was the extremely loud, high pitched, door bell that sounds every time the door is opened.  Yeesh that was annoying. Turn it down boys.

Great customer service deserves five stars. The young man working tonight was in top form.  I popped in to waste time while waiting for my Chinese food to go order.  I was offered help in finding something I may have been looking for, offered a sample of a sports drink, discussed various supplements and inquired about the purpose of some.  And I even picked up something my sister in law sorta directed me to.  AND he even politely listened to me ramble about dog shows -I was hoping he might encourage his Mom to get out there and start showing her Aussies. Now if only I could've remembered if I have one of those gnc cards. Probably on my keyring.

Located on the NE corner of Lindsey and Warner Rd. is a location I've never been to before.  Surprisingly clean but way too much of that frangrance being pumped in.  Nice products but it doesn't appear that they've got the knack for displaying the stuff. I picked up several things I didn't need, mirror and another waterer for the chicken coop, an unusual card display I can put on my desk and use for pictures or whatever, and a dehyradtor so I can crank out more treats for my puppers. Yep, I feel like I scored. Using my 20% off coupon upped my savings AND I even shared it with a fellow shopper to help save her some pennies too.

This place is always a great experience.  The brew selection, the menu items, the casual ambience, and of course the beautiful birds. You can learn something here. Seriously, you can, cuz they have classes ocasssionaly.  The Bird Food appetizer is tripping.  Why don't they have this stuff at theaters where they NEED it?! Nice server/bartender and informative brewers. Groovy.

I've come to this location a couple times and arrived back at home with the order wrong.   They're quite pricey too, so when you drive off with your order you expect them to get it right. The burgers are okay, the fries are good, the frozen custard is pretty good too. Most recent order was a frozen custard with brownie pieces.  My cup came out with the brownie pieces in the bottom of the container and the custard was simply filled on top of the brownie.  I thought the additions were mixed in. I know you're not supposed to make assumptions.

Kewl concept and probably a much needed option too. I originally thought this place may have been affiliated with a salad restaurant in Tucson but it's not.  It is a Gilbert based business.   Perfect. I got the Strawberry and Roasted Almond Salad with the additional grilled free range chicken.  My son got a Spinach & Smoked Bacon wrap with the added chicken.  His disappeared before i could snap a picture.  Mine is a good size salad bowl with a good portion of chicken.  Disappointed that it had so few strawberries in it cuz it's like a buck fifty more than the other salads without any extras.  Also one bite tasted soapy.  WTH did that come from????  Also came across a couple hair like fibers in my salad like short animal hair or something.   Maybe bristle from a produce scrubbing brush?    Natural afternoon daylight really helps improve my vision bit that's not always a good thing.  :-p.  We'll try this place again I suppose.

ANDREW and Samantha were the employees working the day I came in to see what they had and load up on more food.   They turned out to be uninformed and the complete opposite of polite or helpful.  Basically Innova Large Bites is on sale for $19.99, regular $51.99 -----depending on which Pet Club you go to.   After loading up fourteen (14) 30lb bags of Innova Large Bite kibble to take advantage of a BOGO deal that ends May 31st I was told that this particular food was 19.99 -an even better price.  Saved me about $150 bucks.  THIS location had displayed at the entrance Salmon & Herring "on sale" for 39.99 along with a second sign that says Buy One Get One Free (the current deal).  However, the guy tells me it's not BOGO and that's the price for one (1) bag only.  Um, it's a sale price so you can't mark it up.  What is that?  Bait and switch.  I have photos of the signs as they were displayed too. And even though earlier today I picked up more than two dozen bags of Innova at Pet Club for $19.99 they will not honor that price because basically "any customer could come in saying anything about prices", additionaly, only the manager can enter a modified price.   Well I thanks for insulting me and basically calling me a liar.  Andrew,  or was it Anthoney?  You passed judgement, made assumptions, and copped an attitude cuz you thought this average dressed, fat, old lady came in to rob your stores profits.  Here are some details about should realize: I'm purchasing a few hundred pounds of dog food every couple of months.   I also purchase chicken feed/supplies and rat feed/supplies.  I'm a regular customer and I refer my pet people here. I'm a member of various breeds clubs in the Valley along with dog activity groups. I promote and encourage responsible pet ownership and feeding a quality kibble. I breed/own/exhibit several Great Danes.  I'm active on social media and I routinely post when/where kibble is on sale. For more than 20 years I've been doing this and I don't come into Petclub to just say food is on sale so I can save a few bucks.   Because the coupon said it was limited to stock on hand I passed on dinner on this particular occasion so I could take advantage of what they had and see if they had any 10% more bags.  There were no 10% more bonus bags at this location AND they were not on sale for 19.99 according to Andrew.  Price he could sell them for was $51.99 each bag.    Pet Club, get it together.  I got the a similar story last time I came to this location.  Quit putting your staff in this situation.   Quit causing me to waste time, gas, and get angry cuz this location is poorly managed.  Management decided to take advantage of a three day holiday weekend and hasn't come in for a couple days to bring staff up to date.   Your prices vary from store to store. Your management doesn't pass along information in a timely manner. Your computer system isn't even linked between stores to show prices at other stores,  what's on hand, etc. Same food at one store is a different prices at another store in the same city. Employees must call another store for details.   And then there is limited authorization ability in stores.  However in this situation I have come across those who are willing and capable of making a phone call to their boss or another store. The guy at this location was adamant.   Customer service and sales doesn't seem to be his forte'.  Yes even I want to save a few bucks, but I don't come into your stores and LIE about the price of food. Insults. Implying I was a liar. FTM, customers are liars. Quality customer service happening here.

So many five star reviews really gave me an unrealistic idea of what to expect. Had I read the reviews and it may have had greater influence on my decision to come here.  I wanted oatmeal for breakfast and so many 5 star reviews gve me cause to bookmark this place.   So when I got a hankering for oatmeal the other day this place seemed only logical.   Our time of arrival was good cuz we only had one couple ahead of us.  A young lady approached and asked if it was our first time visiting there and then proceeded to school us on the menu.  Sounds good and it looked interesting too. I do wish they had a menu that provided more details of the various mix on combinations.   That would have greatly influenced my choice and possibly my opinion of the food. Upon checking in I see a Yelp perk FREE COOKIE.  Yippee.  We order, pay, grab a seat and do our phone thing. The coffee took a few minutes and i was glad we had our phone thing to keep us occupied while waiting.  I mean there was only one other customer. The cookie was devoured while waiting for our meal. The oatmeal was NOT even close to what I anticipated. It was palatable but it seemed more like a treat I would offer a horse.  I mean you're basically eating this stuff dry because they use the minimum amount of liquid. Eating my oatmeal required some serious mastication. Flavor was good but it was so, well I suppose just too dry for my taste that I ate (chewed and carefully grinding the oats)  maybe half of mine and just took the rest home with the intention of feeding it to my hens.  It was like eating an oatmeal cookie recipe sans the eggs and butter.  It wasn't pleasant and i just couldn't eat anymore.  The disposable dishes and utensils for dining in was strange too and apparently they provide an explanation why but it doesn't seem very earth friendly.  Yes I know the recycling concept appeals to many but I suspect it helps to reduce labor cost more than it benefits our environment. Overall I was far from impressed.  Sadly Iss' didn't even come close to satisfying my desire for a hot oatmeal breakfast and I can't imagine ever coming back and not likely to recommend. Az

Another burger place.  Don't get me wrong, I love hamburgers, but I don't need more temptation to eat another burger.  This is the third one within a mile, not including McDonlds and The Vine.  It was not easy getting into this place either if you're East bound on Elliot Rd. I drove around that parking lot looking for a way on that doesn't currently exist.   :-p  I will tell you service was prompt and polite.  Menu appears to have some decent options. My fail was to combine some toppings on the burger that just didn't blend well.  I don't understand.  Blue cheese, spinach, tomatoe, and onion is GREAT as a salad.  On top of a burger it was blech.   Burger was well done, as in overcooked.  And greasy. The egg bun is good. French fries are alright. Shake was tasty, but how often do you encounter a shake fail.    Personally, I dont think we'll be back here very often.

Good selection of donuts and a baker that will make something if they don't have it if you order in advance.

Slow.... Well they did just open so maybe the staff is fres, er, new too. Our order - Venti Hot Chai Tea Latte and a Grande Iced Mocha.  Chai didn't take too long but the  Mocha was finally served after the Chai,  two drive through customers and two or three customers ordering inside the store. Hmmm. Nice if they could get both out at the same time. Atmosphere is roomy, open and dark.  I think it is really nice and appealing.  Maybe the expansive size of this location will mean quicker drive thru service.  Maybe, eventually, it will pick up inside too.   I foresee it will soon become the hangout for students from Corona and the nearby schools.  Good for business, sure, but I just get the impression that it will soon resemble the malls.  I'll probably keep with the other location North of here.

Same Regency Cleaners staff and locations,  just new business name, ownership with more focus placed on a more environment friendly product and more current style.  No price changes.  Great chance to catch up with manager to get an idea whats going on, how the change affects us as customers, and get the low down on the product used.  Hoping to see an improvement from previous ownership.  I know the staff makes great efforts to provide customer care and service.  In the past I watched some good employees walk away and I am certain it was because of upper management aka previous owners.

New location.  Five stars.    Closest Circle K to the college.  I think they needed this.

This location officially opens 03.05.2015 but they had a VIP today.  What?!  A VIP Event that doesn't include local Yelpers?  How can that be?!   Well even though I've got a very early dental appointment you bet your sweet treats I'll be there to help open the doors...  on Friday.   Cuz they open to late for me to help tomorrow. Kneaders is similar to Wildflower and Paradise/Panera in that you can get tasty baked goods (cookies, muffins, loaves of bread) but they also have what I would call higher end pastries like Napoleon's, cheesecake, Cannoli, Tarts, Eclairs, Macaroons, and so much more.  The selection is devine.  So many temptations to help you forget any diet. I like the Irish Oatmeal here, mostly because they accomodate you in the toppings department.  So good I want 2nds. The Greek Omelette was unique.  Tasty and a refreshing blend too but not exactly enough for me when I've got a hankering for an omelette. Lunch/Dinner options are ideal.  I like the sandwich, salad, and soup options. And the gift area seems to be a weakness for me.  I enjoy checking out all the tchochkes that are so nicely displayed.  Seasonal and otherwise.  And they'll put together a gift basket for you too.   So neat.  Don't come in here if you've got a weakness for impulse buying.  Hungry now.  *Open*Open*Open*

It was 230 p.m. and there was a wait. Of course I understand this.  Their menu is kinda complicated if you've never been here before.  Shouldn't they have a place on the menu board that says exactly what comes on a sandwich?  And you may order soup with your sandwich and they give you a salad too?  It doesn't say that on the menu board. So like I said, it can be complicated. So anyway, there's a wait. We order soup, water, and a dessert to share.  Why does it take as long for soup as it does a sandwich? Soup was nothing close to homemade.  In fact, it was very similar to soup from a can.  The Chicken Noodle was viscous like Campbell's soup.  Even Progresso has a better broth.  The noodles were kinda pasty.  The Tomato Basil Ravioli had my kid telling me Chef Boyardee.   Normally we have sandwich and soup so I've never focused on the soup.  This time I only had soup to focus on. I do like that they have soda water on the fountain.   We shared a slice of the Berry Cheesecake.  Super dense, creamy, and tasted like a marketed cheesecake complete with the flavor of the cardboard still on the graham cracker bottom. Hmmm. Must've been today's cook, huh?

Movies are not getting any cheaper.  Well let's be real, nothing is.  So I prefer the matinée, I bring my annual soda cup, and I make sure we have our refillable popcorn bag from previous visit or that's what we order up with getting a soda.  I like that I can come inside and purchase tickets from a machine instead of waiting for an employee to do the task.  We generally get there early to find our seats and get comfortable while the lights are still on.  This particular day we didn't plan so well so I was a bit perturbed that the guy at ticket booth was taking his sweet time. I've not based my review on the service for this particular day because generally my experience here is very satisfying.
