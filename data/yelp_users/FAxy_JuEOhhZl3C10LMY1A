I cant pronounce Rokerij but you don't have to be able to pronounce it to enjoy the amazing food.  Rokerij like everyone on here prob. explains has their own full menu + Richardson's menu.  Both menus are amazing in their own right also side note according to the server in just over a month Richardson's will be reopened directly next door, so look for that to finally happen.  Things I love about this place?  The atmosphere is amazing upstairs and down (downstairs is a underground cellar like bar, super cool i posted a picture a while back they serve a full menu as well), you really have to see it to understand how cool it is!  Taking in the restaurant from the outside is kinda strange its really closed in looking (no windows which is normally ok.. if your at a strip club) but once your inside its really calming and pleasant.  Now that you feel comfortable inside we can talk about the food which is equally as amazing.  Richardson's menu is heavy on the garlic so if its not a 1st date go nuts because its worth it, actually F it if she doesn't like you because you like good food then drop her/him.  The Rokerij menu is less heavy on the Mexican food side, its more Americanized burgers, steaks, fish.  I had the mahi-mahi with pineapple salsa and it rocked my taste buds(in the most positive of ways), the fish was cooked perfectly as well as blackened, I recently had eaten fish in San Diego as well as New Zealand and this fish was just as good if not better quality, very impressive.  Another thing they do is cool is you can get these "small plates" 1 for 9 or 2 for 17, it goes on its basically a bunch of tapas like tacos, ahi tuna, prime rib sliders, scallops, steak tartare, etc.  I love tapas and for social settings its a great and delicious idea.  Overall 4 stars for now because i need to eat more items off that tapas menu to upgrade this review, something im looking forward to taking advantage of next time

It was silly to only give this legendary place 4 stars, I stand corrected by myself

Croque is a very different as well as delightful kind of place.  Legitimately there is nothing else out there like Croque's.  You think it should be some kind of Louisiana style restaurant full of fried Catfish and gumbo like dishes or maybe a French restaurant full of less interesting French food but instead its a place that serves sandwiches, soups and various Asian themed bowls.  They have 18 different kinds of sandwiches that are American, French, Korean and German motif, so there is a lot of variety and each sandwich is of the highest quality.  I've only had the Bulgoki myself(people I've eaten with their have had the Madame and the Tuna but say there were equally amazing) but I've had it in the less traditional "sandwich" form as well as the bowl and the flavor is spectacular, rivaling Bulgoki I've had at excellent Korean restaurants all over the valley.  I'm looking forward to trying the other sandwiches as well as various soups of the day (ex Mushroom Brie looked amazing), overall this is the best new sandwich place around, forget about boring Subway for lunch and try a sandwich worth eating at Croque's

I had to run here on lunch to get my oil changed and 2 tires replaced before i left on a trip the next day to Flagstaff and i couldnt be happier.  The people i spoke with over the phone were very accomodating gave me a great price and most importantly got me in and out on time to work.  I really must say i will go back here again when i get my brakes done, as well any other routine maintence im too lazy to do myself, and back to the tires they beat the price on tires for the same tire everywhere else and had them in stock for me the same day!

I've been a long time Bank of America customer, almost 15 years which is upsetting cause either I'm old, started working too young or a combo of both.  Either way the people at Desert Schools are amazing, they actually seem to care, are personable and seem to be looking out for the customer.  Also there is a chuck e cheese nearby which is where a kid can be a kid, so thats a plus.

Its like a Jamba Juice but with heart.   The owners are very friendly and as I always say we must support our local business's!  The wheatgrass here was clean, fresh and delicious ( well as good as wheatgrass can be) I also had a juice but none of the food... yet.  The juice was fantastic!  You can tell they really fine tuned their recipies and made something you cant make on your own.  That being said if the food is as good as that juice (which btw gave me CRAZY energy) i will be raising this to 5 stars.  The menu for food looked great, huge selection, no bland sandwiches but i was im a hurry so i didnt have sandwich time :( NEXT TIME 4 sure

They do up to $50 cash back here, that's unexpected.  This was orig a tip but YELP wants me to review so based on that fact alone 4 stars.  On top of that if you need anything in a pinch like for travel or something its always a good place to go.  Plus you can get balloons here, who doesn't love balloons.  Price range here is literally one dollar sign #JOKES

To clarify I'm not the Justin V below, whom sucks.  I'm the one who posted the picture which rocks.  That being said what I'm here to talk about is Rivas and the amazing quality and flavor I've grown accustom to upon each and every visit.  Regardless of me being high or drunk when eating within the superb culinary landscape that is Rivas,  the food is spectacular.  I would say even sometimes better when I'm intoxicated (due to high endorphin rushes) or partaking in recreational drugs of which the after effects could increase pleasure.  Either way Rivas is A-OK #1, don't listen to these haters whom believe they can build credibility by changing their names to legit people like myself, mazel tov

I've been trying to eat here for months but only end up getting there on a Sunday which sucks because they are closed on sunday!  Either way I got to go yesterday and it really lived up to the hype!  Playboy roll 1st off is amazing, the freshness and quality is something I've never experienced in the "avenues" ironically good food is usually found in the "streets" ( that's funny to me) but really food was great from the rolls to the miso soup all great.  Another plus is the price which is low for the high quality food you get, this is def in my top 3 sushi places.  Only complaint was the creepy waiter who stood behind us the whole time and wouldn't speak to me he handed both waters to my girlfriend as well as was unable to answer questions about rolls and stuff but was with her which is just odd, food was amazing service needs some work :)

Starbucks has terrible coffee but they make frozen "coffee" drinks full of sugar, whipped cream and any other flavor but coffee so fat people love them and we are stuck with one to 4 on every corner.  Coffee Bean has delicious coffee, if you don't drink those milkshakes other coffee places have and enjoy Americanos and other drinks actually showcasing the coffee which is not bitter and gross like starbucks you will love coffeebean.  I just wish there were more around and supposed coffee lovers will put down a double carmal mocha and just enjoy an iced coffee (we are in AZ).  Tell me something else amazing about the iced coffee? OK, Crushed ice!!

OH MY GOD THIS PLACE IS GROSS! These taco bells have all been knocked down and rebuilt due to conditions that no longer make them sanitary enough to eat at.  Now this being said i like taco bell and I eat their healthy options because im not obese, as well as i don't go there much but this particular location which is unfortunately near my work i have been to several times.  The workers are illiterate which i spelled wrong and used spell check taking away all credibility but really scummy workers, gross place and my order has been messed up every time ive gone, go else where but not culvers because they SUCK TOO, and i dislike you if you like culvers honestly they shouldnt be in business

I like this place, its cheap as hell and delicious for what you pay for.  Now many may disagree like my girlfriend or others who have not great reviews but the chicken dishes are good, especially the amazing chicken which is nothing short of it, amazing that is.  They have an un filled fish tank and an Asian man whom was pot bellied gave me my togo order both of which are unsettling but the food was good and the price was right for example wonton soup for a dollar full meals under  7 plus a cool name like table tennis, think about it forrest

1st off there are great breweries in Arizona, a place where if I didn't live I would of never guessed, 4 peaks is one of them.  I fell in love with 4 peaks back when I lived in Tempe and began my 10 year college career (I took my time :) / :( ).  My roommates and I heard the beer was delicious and they had a bunch of different kinds to try on happy hour, some beers with higher alcohol content which is really what got me interested.  The RAJ IPA was amazing and is one of my favorite beers there but after a few times of getting drunk faster than everyone else and going home early ( or falling asleep in, on, under or around tables)  I decided to branch out and try the other beers.  Being brewed here in AZ they are all superb, fresh and delicious, the food here is also good, not amazing its not gourmet by any means but its a little "different" than typical bar food (wings and sandwiches), think Zipps.  For example Four Peaks has beer bread, Zipps has focaccias which isn't like focaccia at all but its good and different, there's nothing like it anywhere else than these 2 restaurants, you will have to see it or try it to really understand.  Either way if you feel like beer, good beer look no where else, unless your in Flagstaff then you have to go to Beaver Street Brewery which is also an excellent brewery in AZ.

I get cheap food that's good at the time then you feel like death later.  Haji-baba has cheap food, insanely cheap food, food so cheap you would debate eating there due to the cheapness but have no choice but to give it a shot because.. ITS SO CHEAP.  The quality of the food at Haji-Baba is parallel to high end middle eastern restaurants, its FANTASTIC.  The chicken shawarma wrap I ordered was 3 dollars and change, the size of a glove box ( exaggerating but its BIG) and incredibly delicious!  I cannot recommend this place enough so good, so delicious and the price doesn't factor into the quality at all!  Go here and love it!

I have waited up to 15 minutes in the drive thru here for an iced coffee...  I gave this place 5 stars  I have been late to work, threatening my career with a company I've spent almost a decade with...  I gave this place 5 stars  I love D'lish, the food, the drinks, everything here is fantastic.  I could eat the California club 3 times a day and only drink their coffee and be happy the rest of my life, I've considered moving to be in walking distance and due to the housing market have almost rented a commercial space to live out of even though it will cost me 3 times as much.  I think I'm gonna do it, and quit my job.. I love D'lish

It was the afternoon so I said why not try a non breakfast sandwich, so i took a chance on the "chicken panini" (added avocado because as you know which you all should avocado is a gift from the gods) AND IT BLEW MY BRAINS!  I ate it so quick I couldn't take a picture or I would upload its deliciousness to it can stimulate your eyes as it did my stomach.  This place never disappoint's, EVER!

I hate driving a uhaul so much until today I was able to avoid it.  The staff here was great!  Friendly, helpful and attentive.  The uhaul was in great shape for a uhaul which is pretty much the scariest thing to drive EVER IMO (at least with a normal license). They also full propane which is also a plus, def would recommend again to anyone looking to move their own junk :)

This place is cool, huge selection of premade foods, alcohol and everything.  Its like a crazy mexican market but the majority of the food is actually edible, also they have covered parking and if your a real jerk valet.  Covered parking is cool, on the other hand valet is a bit obnoxious for a grocery store no mater how cool it is.

I moved and this is the closest LA Fitness to my new home (feel free to congratulate me on my home purchase :)) The equipment at this LA Fitness has been the same for nearly a decade, i know cause i was forced to go about that long ago and in short that sucks.  They have nice locker rooms though and a pool if your into that (honestly i think its kinda gross, esp seeing naked fat men in the locker room and knowing they swim in that pool/use the spa).  Considering the location its shocking this club is so terrible, if the upgrade their machines I would have limited complaints but they are so limited, old and/or working improperly I cant do it.  Either I have to go way out of the way to another "ok/better" LA Fitness or join that minimalist gym youfit off Tatum and greenway it starts at $10 dollars a month and all the equipment is new but from what I hear limited to some degree ill update on that later either way please skip this gym, its terrible.

It was Sept 18, 2012... oh you say whats that?  National Cheeseburger Day!  Ive heard great things about Wally's and have been to its sister restaurant quite a few times Grassroots (which is fantastic) and decided on such a momentous occasion why not give it a shot.  First off the place is really cool, Irish bar styled, really comfortable feel to the place.  People here are very polite and friendly (staff and patrons) it really gives a Cheers like vibe (the TV show not the shitty bar in Glendale, oh you don't know about that? THANK GOD).  I tried the wine burger which is slowly grilled with red wine sangria, topped with Swiss and sauteed mushrooms annnnnnnnnnnnd its amazing.  Really flavorful and def worth eating bad for, it made my Cheeseburger Day easy.  It came with mixed fries (sweet and reg potato) I don't have fries much (cause they are so terrible for you, then again so is the cheeseburger but its a holiday so F it) but they were crispy and flavorful so also fantastic.  The menu is full of lots of other tasty looking options I'm looking forward to trying in particular the caramelized vidalia onion and guinness soup, I mean how great does that sound?! Oh you think that sounds gross? Go to hell, everyone else try this place :)

Great service great food! The pizza isn't for everyone so if your a jerk who likes dominos you won't appriciate this amazing pizza! It's thinner than humble pie (at least the rustica) but not as thin as sauce ( which is nowhere near as good as this place) GO NOW!

Paul's Ace hardware is excellent, forget about HOME DEPOT and their big box baloney (or bologna), we gotta support these smaller local businesses.  Personally I have never met Paul but based on the customer service I've experienced as well as free popcorn I'm gonna have to go on record and say he probably is pretty kick ass.  Quick story: When I was there last 2 kids came in after school because they saw the free popcorn.  They politely asked and the man at the register if they could have some and he said go ahead, didnt make them buy 2 x 4's or a bucket of paint :).   Its nice to see some community and customer support/respect at its forefront!

Only been once so more of a full review will follow.  I was waiting for a movie and got an espresso because I'm C&C, yeah that's right, cultured and classy.  Coffee was very good, menu looked great as did the actual food I saw people eating around me while I was staring creepily.  The overall place feels pretty legit too, the waiter had an Italian accent which reminds me of the old country ( I've never been to Italy but I've seen The Godfather and they sound like this guy).  Either way I was impressed def gonna go back, also they have biscotti the side of a loaf of bread here! BADA BING!

I LOVE THAT DINOSAUR, I mean that dinosaur actually gets me wanting to gas up and purchase various convince store items like candy bars and gas station cheeseburgers.  I don't even eat candy bars or gas station cheeseburgers but I would do anything for that dinosaur, I swear to God I'm not drunk I just really like Sinclair Gas :)

Maybe I've never owned a pickup truck or slept with my sister but i don't get this place just the same.  I might as well see stellar reviews for burger king or Wendys.  This place is fast food, processed, greasy, nothing special.  In n out it gourmet to this like a burger from roaring fork compared to mcdonalds, not to mention crazy over priced I guess to pay for their fancy sign.  Keeping it real there are so many good burger places and I'm glad fat people with no taste go here to save the good ones for me.  This being said I went because I work close and was dragged to for lunch.  I had the processed chicken sandwich and a bite of the butter burger.  Honestly should have got a happy meal from McDonald's plus would of scored a toy, that's like a free star.

THAI HOUSE IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE BEST THAI FOOD IVE EVER HAD!!  The flavors of all the dishes I sampled blew my brains, and the cost to quality was insane, which means the food quality is excellent and the price is insanely cheap.  They must get a lot of business otherwise I cant see how they can make any money turning out this amazing food at such a low cost.  I went with 2 of my friends and we split 3 items, we got the Chicken Panang, Beef Pra-Ram and the orange chicken.  Now before you judge about the orange chicken, F U it was amazing this isn't panda express this is high quality deep fried and battered chicken! HAHA but really its excellent (mainly the sauce) for what it is which is what I just said.  The Panang which should be ordered anytime upon entering a Thai restaurant was the best I've never had and the Beef Pra-Ram hidden on the back on the menu was like nothing I've ever had.  It was in a delicious peanut sauce that I wanted to pour all over my body and use in the lovemaking process OVERALL A+ AMAZING RESTAURANT!!!  P.S. the good for kids part, I would say yes as far as the setting but I don't know a lot of kids who like Thai food.  ALSO the $$ is for dinner, $ for lunch, mad cheap, mad delicious, GO!

What can I say about trader joes that hasnt been said before, its great and this review is more so for all trader joes of the world that equally rock faces.  And by rock faces I dont mean that in the UFC way where you will get injured or injure other customers in the store because thats rude and completely ridiculous but it rocks your face with deliciousness.  Its hard to find something I dont like at trader joes and at some times I'm like hey this is over priced then I buy wine thats fantastic and half the cost or a regular label at a normal store like Albertsons of which i truly hate.  I hate Albertons, im sorry they are terrible, that is all.

Bathrooms are made for high traffic so they are pretty well maintained, other than that who really cares your taking a bathroom break here on your way to somewhere unless you live near here which if so, I'm sorry.  You can also buy a 20" off brand TV mad cheap so if your in the market which is weird for the target demo of Love's get on it.

I love this place, sure its kinda creepy and in the middle of an odd office complex but DAMN those donut holes chocolate cake not the glazed ones are good!  Not to mention the NINJA BOWLS!!  Good God get the Sizzling ninja, top that off with a fried egg, and pineapple, get healthy with some brown rice and white chicken and then DRENCH that bowl with NINJA SAUCE AND SRIRACHA (which comes standard btw) AMAZING! Don't waste your life away without having one of these ninja bowls at this donut shop, i never thought i would be able to say that statement with a straight face but i did!  And for those wondering they don't serve pirates (some will understand this fact)  Also if you come back a few times they might throw some free donut holes at YOUR FACE LIKE NINJA STARS!!  I joke they don't throw them but you may get some for free (really though)!

I love pita pit the food is always fresh and the size of the pita is huge, the dude below whom "throws fist in the air emphatically" must weigh around 350 or so or is just retarded to confuse the size of a large pita and a mcdonalds snack wrap. The pitas are big and worth the money then again u can get like 6 snack wraps for the same price but those are crap. Oh yeah and no toasting option . . . ? Who cares haha

Aside from the fact that Rebecca N. is into Mike the bartender which i don't have any background on other than the review this place is delicious and to be honest the best burger ive had in a long time.  I love deluxe and also places like Stax which is good but not great (deluxe is great btw not Stax), either way the food was great not the service or annoying people next to me but i cant hold the restaurant responsible ( the people behind me made me want to stab myself in the ears with an icepick, service was crap but...)  the quality of burger was GREAT!  Its the best high quality restaurant burger ive ever had, its pricey but really worth it for a great burger.  I cant say enough about how good the burger was, me and my girlfriend whom have different tastes in burgers loved the ones we got and ate them in their entirety, which never happens we always have left overs or split it but we went for it and it was great!  If you need a burger and are tired of eating healthy its a great get away!

This place is fun and im not just saying that because im intoxicated but because im a season pass holder and cannot drink there which in most cases is a deal breaker but this place is a good fun time.  I live in a development where the condos have a community pool and its great well not really i say that because i dont live in an apartment, either way i pay 40 dollars for unlimited pool access with crazy slides, its fun and in my book worth it being so close to home.  Some things are boring like the lazy river which is more action packed at golfland sunsplash in Mesa but overall lots of fun i def recommend it esp the kids area which is more fun then the wave pool anyday although im not sure if im allowed to use it.  MY HELPFUL HINTS!!! PLEASE READ ON!!! 1. Locker rentals are 7 dollars and stuff is left all over so im pretty sure you can leave your stuff anywhere and no one will touch it! Save some cash! 2. Your feet will be destroyed, really its sad the cement is either hot or "spikey" you will understand, get cheap flip flops again like before no one will take them its comfortable and safe! 3. The roller coaster ride is scary and the 6 rainbow slides are a quick line and fun, hit them up first because it sets you up to get excited for the crazier slides!  Those are my tips! BTW DONT GET THE CHIPSTICKS THEY ARE POTATO CHIPS THAT ARE NOT GOOD OR WORTH 5 DOLLARS, really they are not good, look cool but not good!

Fresh and easy has been a good market in a pinch, it's not a full grocery store substitute but if you want something fresh and pretty flavorfull it's worth the trip.  Fresh and easy has been helpful many a Friday at home night supplying things like Brie and other delicous and low priced cheeses.  Honestly pices for goat cheese and feta are cheaper then any supermarket and better quality it's worth it for cheese's of the world alone.   Also you can technically try anything in the store, I'm sure toiletries as well as some pastas don't count but they have a huge selection of really good pre made meals, which until recently weren't really healthy hence the fat woman in the picture I posted.  Either way I'm not proof reading this and writing it on my iPod touch so I apologize if this review is not my best but overall I really like fresh and easy, they have good quality foods not usually found in grocery stores, are healthier than take out( barely) and great on a stay home Friday or weekend, check it out you will find something you like or something good for lunch at work. :) that's a smiley as if to show this place is friendly and I welcome you to visit.

I love Hawaii and I love rum and Tiki's and like Polynesian sauce from Chick Fil-A and I like Pineapples and cool looking glasses and happy hours.  I love Hulas because it has all these things.  What really makes this place is the drinks, I haven't had such good tropical drinks since i visited Hawaii, seriously they hold up and hold up well plus they come in awesome glasses that you can purchase or if your a real douche steal ( I don't condone that).  The only reason Hulas doesnt get 5 stars from me is the food, its been hit and miss for me.  Not bad but not AMAZING, and when you build a place like this with such fantastic drinks and an excellent ambiance you would only expect the food to follow suit.  That being said I will go again and try something new again and hopefully I'll find that dish that blows me away but for the mean time I'll enjoy drinking like I'm on a tropical island in the middle of the desert.

I always forget how quality this place is, they use all boars head meats and have an excellent bagel selection.  Their lunch special is also incredible for 5.95 you get a huge bagel, loaded with quality meat accompanied by a fountain soda (I refill like a mofo, I'm thirsty) & chips!  Way too much food needed for the average bear but at that price I can't complain.

The journey to Buzzberry started off crappily.  I was on my way to work and couldn't turn left at Hayden and Indian Bend due to construction forcing me to drive south (further away from my projected destination) and towards Mcdonald.  I was already running late to work so I didnt have time to eat or drink anything when i passed by Buzzberry and said to myself, damn yo imtired slash hungry what's this all about.  The building is inviting and with an attached drive thru appealing to someone in a hurry/on the go.  The coffee was great and actually gave me some energy, the breakfast burrito was great as well, flavorful and fresh!  Try it out you won't be disappointed, support the little guys F Starbucks, for serious.

I like coffee and dunkin is where its at!  It takes a few times to get use to the coffee its different than Starbucks (which is bitter and terrible but i still like it) or coffee bean (WHICH IS GREAT!) but its own flavor is origional and i appriciate it.  Its crazy close to my work which is good they have great breakfast options as well (aside from donuts), the flatbread breakfast sandwich is really good and under 300 calories so you can afford eating delicous dunkin' donuts by saving the calorie intake on that.  Either way the service is quick i love the coffee and im mad caffinated up so maybe thats why they got 5 stars.

I always feel awkward going into a goodwill but this place is great!  Huge selection of tons of stuff from electronics to clothes.  That being said I would never buy the clothes but I needed a tv small, color, cheap.  For 6 bucks I got a tv I have hidden at work to play video games can't beat the price and it works great!  One mans trash is truely another mans treasure!

I'm 1000% contradicting myself reviewing a fast food restaurant but this Burger King being new looks fancy and according to recent new articles may start selling beer which I approve of.  Also honestly a whopper Jr is amazing for $1.00 + w/o cheese and mayo (I use w/o which my mom taught me from secretary school in like 68' that's shorthand also to clarify she didn't teach me in 68 she probably learned it then because I did not exist) is only like 260 calories so it's a quick, delicious, drive through option that saves me from hunger in transit, thank you Burger King. Go the hell Culvers oh yeah i said it!

Before you look at the stars and don't read on let me tell you I loved El Chorro I went years ago before it shut down and reopened and i yes i was saddened when i came back.  They kept true to the sticky buns and the relish tray (which truly isn't great but i eat it and appreciate it being there because im hungry and with family which is lovely HAHA, also rolls on request, really on request and they are worse than grands, yes i wish i was joking) but really the new place is better in some aspects!  Its huge and really pretty but the food is not good.  I wish it good and hope over time it will be but the food was terrible and ive eaten good food i got duck it was so bad and  their signature fish dish which we were told that the workers came in on their day off to eat "pan seared escolar" was Eh, i would rather get Sea Bass at a good restaurant like Ocean Club.  I didn't go in like someone expecting to get blown away i expected a good Easter dinner based on the fact ive been here before years ago and enjoyed it so i went in expecting the price per dish to be as good as it was, well its not and its sad because the place is pretty and it looks like horses can get married in the back grassy area (check it out, it makes sense).

This pizza is the only official Versace Napoletana pizza in Arizona.  Although this could be a fictitious award it doesn't mean it's not delicious.  This pizza is amazing, the ingredients are quality and the flavor of the sauce is what really puts it over the edge for me, sweet but not overly complimented by in my case buffalo ( or bufalo, im not sure) mozzarella. I got the bufala dop and their meat fried pizza.  Yes fried pizza, it's like a calzone that's fried in sweet dough, def worth trying but next time I'll try 2 different pizzas. Great location and decor, also a cool looking oven!  My only complaint is horrible parking, not their fault though and I prob needed a good walk anyway after eating so much, so maybe I should be thanking them.

If you have read my reviews in the past one could peg me as a alcoholic that being said I LOVE LEE'S CREAM LIQUEUR!  Seriously this ice cream regardless of the alcohol is top notch!  Its homemade not processed, below average ice cream you find in chains all over the valley.  For you kids out there they also have regular ice cream (which i haven't had cause I'm an adult and adults drink their calories) on top of the alcoholic flavors so no ones left out.  The alcohol really does compliment the ice cream nicely, its not overbearing and I'm pretty sure it doesn't get you drunk but it tastes fantastic which is the most important thing anyway.  The service is spectacular, friendly and its in a great spot (by like every good old town restaurant) so save room for dessert even though cowboy ciao makes that difficult and try out Lee's!

I like coffee because I like caffeine, I like caffeine because I like to feel strung out but without the stigma associated with illegal narcotics.  Due to this fact of my life I always am trying new coffee places all over the country, even in New Zealand where if you order an iced coffee they assume you want ice, cream and on top of the ice and cream actual ice cream, that's just crazy to me.  Anyway back to Elevate, 1st off the place is huge, lots of seating that's really comfortable (couches and such) they also have a great menu of food items which all things considered could be good or bad.  Ive been to many a coffee shop with terrible food but Elevate ironically  "raises the bar" (GET IT HAHAHAHAH OH MAN THAT'S HILARIOUS, GOOD GOD I CANT STOP LAUGHING HOW ABOUT YOU? OH ITS NOT THAT FUNNY? yeah your right) and actually puts together some delicious food.  All their baked items appear to be made there and are spectacular as well as their sandwiches.  I had the french dip with blueberry coleslaw for the side.  What the hell is blueberry coleslaw?  I don't know but its F'ing amazing, so was the sandwich (ill post a picture in a minute).  Obviously the coffee is good too, I mean thats how they got me to go check out the place, its to me the level of coffee bean, really good not bitter like the hell that Starbucks serves *HATE STARBUCKS BTW*.  And they have a nice menu of different coffee options to satisfy any coffee lover, Elevate = Great :)

There are few places that are delicious hole in the wall chains.  In fact there really are no hole in the wall chains except Two Hippies and they do it right.  Upon entering two hippies you will see all kinds of crazy decor like a twister mat on the ceiling, chairs... on the ceiling, etc.  Your food options consist of Burgers, Hot Dogs and Tacos, where as your beverage choices consist of regular stuff like various sodas to flavored tea and lemonade.  The flavored tea and lemonade is AMAZING, the flavor in the flavored teas is so good you don't even need to add sweetener, that's impressive.  The food is equally as delicious, I had 2 tacos one was fish (not fried, baked tilapia -so good and healthier) and green beef, they have a red beef and green both are cooked with different peppers and marinades,  The green beef was amazing I'm def. looking forward to trying the red beef as well as the "cactus" taco which is just insane sounding.  Two thumbs up, bring cash though because that's all they take :)

EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS UNDER 475 CALORIES!  That itself is a feat let alone making the food taste good and Seasons 52 succeeded on  all counts.  I am use to going out for dinner and realizing that I can only afford to do it Friday or Sat (once a week) because chances are I'm about to eat 3000 + calories on delicious food at a fine restaurant and I don't want to get so fat I would require wheel chair access (no offence people who are actually handicapped or fat due to genetics, I'm sorry its not your fault).  So finding a place like this that actually has amazing food that's healthy is AMAZING.  I had the buffalo burger which was delicious and full of so many flavors as well as the Basil and Parmesan cheese flat bread, my dining mate I was with had the Farmers Market Vegetable Plate which can be described the following ways, adorable, ambrosial, appetizing, choice, dainty, darling, delectable, delightful, delish, distinctive, divine, enjoyable, enticing, exquisite, fit for king, good, gratifying, heavenly, luscious, lush, mellow, mouthwatering, nectarous, nice, palatable, piquant, pleasant, rare, rich, sapid, savory, scrumptious, spicy, sweet, tasteful, tasty, tempting, titillating, toothsome, well-prepared, well-seasoned, yummy. (yes those are synonyms for delicious).  The servers were also GREAT and full of valuable and helpful information, our server was Madison M. I remember because the servers have business cards which is cool as well as unnecessary (although now I feel i have to ask for them next time I go in, which is fine because they were great).  Super excited to try the many other menu options as soon as possible!

I like the idea of this place more than the actual place.  In theory they could have Apple computers at steep discounts and furniture mad cheap that the university doesn't need anymore that I could possibly give a second life.  Unfortunately the stuff they don't need is normally old dell computers, old mac's and about 1000 file cabinets.  So most the time its crap, but when a dept gets in some cash they update computers and stuff so if you lucky at random times throughout the year you can get an Intel iMac for under 600 dollars which isn't bad at all or you can get a bike that is left in the bike racks on campus for between 50-75 which is actually really good!  If you need a cheap bike in pretty good shape DEF hit this place up otherwise its really hit and miss.  I'm glad it exists I just wish there was more cool stuff ALL THE TIME... that being said I'll drop by this week sometime again either way.

I drink coffee and I drink it daily so majority of the time I let quality suffer for convenience and drink the bitter, burned  stomach unsettling coffee from Starbucks.  There are usually between 2-5 Starbucks at every intersection so good coffee shops have been pushed out due to the American love of drive thru's.  ( I am part of that crowd :( ). One thing you can NEVER get from a BS coffee shop like Starbucks is a Toddy if you don't know what that is feel free to blow your brains out cause you have no idea what iced coffee should taste like.  Even the iced americanos which are brewed traditionally are amazing, no bitterness, no burnt flavor, nothing but smooth deliciousness.  The caffeine level of the coffee is also perfect, high like I like it (that sounds funny).  Either way Press is my favorite coffee shop, I was upset when they shut the city north location but I moved and this location is super close now they also have one at Skyharbor so if your trying to stay awake during that flight hit them up.  Honestly way better than Cartel, if you like Cartel Press will blow you away.

OVERALL 4 STARS ! (The bathrooms themselves which are a combination of the Flintstones and Caesars Palace get 5 stars for originality)  The only reason this review isn't 5 stars is due to the hit and miss service, 2 times I've gone I was treated wonderfully then like a tattooed junkie, which is pretty bad I think even though I'm not sure what I fully mean by that.  But regardless of how I was treated the FOOD was SO AMAZING that I cant give a bad review.  I had the veal parmigiana (which some people are against and those people 1st off haven't tried veal and\or have watched animal planet so they wont eat it but will still will eat slaughtered meat) and I have never had veal this good in my life, the thinness, the flavor, the spaghetti on the side, the sauce was all perfect.  The salad that arrived before the entree was superb, just the right salad to dressing mix accompanied by high quality fresh ingredients.  Next time I'm dying to try one of the pizza's they make fresh they have a cool looking pizza oven, in fact the decor in this place is nuts and I realize i mentioned the bathrooms which are over the top but the place as the whole is really cool due to the design.

Yes one star, I believe I even gave Culver's AKA "whats wrong with America" and Kings Fish house "canned fish on my plate for $25+" 2 stars, but this place was horrible. I'm not a douche, I don't review cruelly unless its earned and they earned this star.  First off service was fine, waitress was no issue so I'm ok with that but the problem started with the drinks.  Now I understand red wine is served room temperature because I am cultured and a closeted alcoholic.  But this wine must of been stored next to the oven cause it was hot as hades (thats hell for you morons) which although the wine was surprisingly good it would of been better below boiling point.  Now the food, first they bring you "Italian bread" which is soft untoasted Texas toast to dip in oil and balsamic vinegar. Why the hell do they use this bread is beyond me but i was starving, so I had a slice and yes it was mediocre at best #shocker.  Next came the meal I ordered the chicken marsala and my lovely date who opted for this place over Squidink #lame ordered the chicken picatta.  The Marsala was ok, nothing special but not bad served with pasta on the side - the pasta was the "standout" of everything we ate.  The picatta was so sour it was almost unedible  but being a gentleman and good looking man I traded with my lovely lady and ate as much as I could until I felt sick from the "sour chicken" which they should change the name of this dish to because it was ridiculous.  After 2 entrees, 1 glass of wine the total after tip was over $50.  Its times like this when Italian restaurants exist this bad I don't understand how Fazoli's went under in Arizona.  On a positive note they have great new big flat screen TV's, something every good Italian restaurant requires #notreally #hireachefoverbuyingTVs #facts

I'm currently working on getting in contact with the owner to change the name of this establishment to "JESUS CHRIST" due to the fact I exclaim that after each bite of their delicious culinary delights .  The menu item in particular I am referring to is the OMG!  I never thought OMG would be something I would say on the regular or even adapt into my daily vocab but this sandwich could be called a "shit sandwich" and I would still rave about it.  So basically no matter how dumb the name is the sandwich, its glory overshadows that.  The OMG for those who don't know is "Prosciutto, Mascarpone, Fig + Honey" now what that does is create a flavor explosion in your mouth similar to a pinata but less violent and more delicious.  I cant speak for breakfast or dinner items yet although the "Crispy Lavosh Pizza of the Moment" catches my eye cause I love that its named that, I will be going back to try more items.  The only reason I gave this place 4 instead of 5 stars is the coffee was good but didn't blow me away, I blame that on people building it up too much but that OMG sandwich will either change your life or save it, get it now!

Fox restaurants typically are delicious, but people like myself and other Yelpers are weary of chain restaurants and although this is the only arrogant butcher and not a chain like Sauce or True Food its easy to lump it together into a "chain restaurant motif" being a Fox restaurant.  Fact of the matter is that's not fair, this unlike a quick in and out concept like Sauce, its a sit down restaurant that turns out to be excellent.   I've read reviews where people were disappointed with the quality, I think those people just drove out of there way maybe living in the west valley or something and amp'ed it up too highly, kinda like when you see a movie and it sucks then its better the next time.  Either way I've been here 3 times and every time had a delicious meal every time.  One thing that's really cool about this restaurant is that they give you an "antipasto" menu that looks like a sushi bar menu (single sheet of papter you can mark on with a pencil) full of various cheeses, meats and extras (grilled asparagus, olives, elephant garlic, $1 mussels, etc.) this allows you to get your appetizers going right away.  Whats great about this is not only the concept but the meats and cheeses are high quality and come with bread and jam that's honestly to die for, so delicious!  I could go for the antipasto menu alone.  To eat I've tried the turkey sloppy joe, which sounds dumb, in defense of the sandwich first off it was lunch and it came with a grilled poblano chili on top, it was amazing.  I've also for dinner tried the sweet baked potato tortellini (excellent) and my favorite thing so far which I will re order is the beef short rib stew with green chiles, fried egg, cornbread.  The flavor with the egg is mindbogglingly awesome and the cornbread is fresh, moist and delicious.  I've never had a bad meal and/or experience here, after here (as far as other bars @ citiscape) is a different story because I have an alcohol problem :)

I'm the duke so i better write a review, I did a 2 week free pass and went everyday.  This place is really cool, all new equipment and its only staffed 10-7 but open 24 hours!  They give you a proximity badge thing you use and its great, you do your own thing and don't have to worry about annoying personal trainers and such (LA FITNESS - I HATE YOU).  I def recommend it but am waiting to fully sign up until more open because where im moving to soon will be too far :( , Hopefully we will meet again Anytime ...

I love sushi and I love bento boxes but the problem with bento boxes is usually I can only get them at lunch. . . BUT NOT AT YOSHI BENTO!  I got a bento box after 8PM last night and it was nothing short of amazing!  I ordered the spicy chicken teriyaki bento box which comes with a salad and some delicious tempura.  The tempura consists of a piece of Shrimp and a few vegetables in this case sweet potato (amazing) and cucumber (good but sweet potato is my favorite after pumpkin which is extra amazing - side note).  I'm excited to go back and try the sushi which seems reasonably priced and according to the pictures delicious!

NACHOBOT is FANTASTIC!  I could leave the review AT THAT, but I wont cause that's boring and unoriginal which is the opposite of this place.  Nachobot is a great concept that thrives on drunk bar hoppers and nacho fans of all shapes and sizes.  They have crazy nacho combinations that seem to run out quickly so don't get there at 3AM on a Friday (even though whatever is left will still be delicious, and if you don't like it walk a house over to Jobot and get your crepe on - ALSO AMAZING).  The owner of Nachobot is also the owner of Jobot SPOILER ALERT/SHOCKER, oops and they run their business very laid back and comfortable.  You feel like your actually inside someones home, which in reality you are cause these buildings are homes converted to restaurants and bars but you get my point.  Either way get over there when your downtown for an incredibly delicious experience complete with chopsticks (so you dont get yourself too messy, no joke interesting concept and it works) DO IT #Bacardiandcoke #startskyandhutchjoke

I really like this place ALOT, the food is all organic/free range/ hippie friendly so I respect that.  I especially respect that when the food is delicious with such restrictions and it is so good job Grassroots!  I have tried the Spit Fire Free Range Chicken which is the juiciest half a chicken I've ever had in my life, amazing flavor as well served with dirty orzo which is like dirty rice but with orzo and it translates perfectly.  Great meal overall, they also have a really good happy hour I haven't taken part in but I uploaded a picture of the menu so everyone can see before they go, any place that has "BOAT LOAD OF WINGS" on the menu deserves a visit in my book.  Also on a side note there were some hot waitresses always a +1 #google (internetjokes)

Oregano's decided to move from their classic old town location just up the road to the old Sugar Daddy's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sugar-daddys-scottsdale) which I didn't approve of because they are trading in their cool ambiance for a chain like atmosphere #superweak especially cause ambiance is what got them where they are at today.  Anyway Brat Haus took over the old Oregano's spot which in itself is fantastic because they are already winning at that location, the patio is still huge and there are still several indoor dining areas that have been remodeled but still feel homey and comfortable.  They have a huge on tap beer selection and a nice menu of crazy brat options, for example the exotic section has rattlesnake and duck brats which I'm intrigued by but I'd rather play it safe.  Speaking of play it safe I DIDN'T, I look the waitress's recommendation of the Thai Chicken brat which was shockingly delicious and flavorful, service was quick and on point, the waitress was nice, attentive and attractive +1

I despise LA Fitness, actually I despise this location http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fitness-phoenix-5 (Tatum in between Cactus and Shea) ( my review http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fitness-phoenix-5#hrid:5tp9ZlcPx1PGPGcxKKYCRQ) because they haven't updated their equipment in over a decade (that includes their AC cause its always like 80 degrees inside).  Either way I moved and I needed somewhere to go that was affordable (I'm keeping LA Fitness, hoping one day it gets remodeled, I mean its in a good area what the hell man #serious) and not very busy, youfit fit this mold (fit,fit,fit).  Youfit is pretty much empty all the time so I can do everything quickly especially cardio which you will never wait for.  The only issue is I cant do everything I "need" to do, their free weights only go up to 75lb and they don't have any hammer strength machines, both of which are vital to my regular workout.  Aside from that its clean, the equipment is NEW and nice, the people working there are friendly and there is never a wait for anything.  My only other gripe is there are no paper towels in the bathroom, they are all "green" so they only have a hand dryer which "I get" but when your sweating a paper towel would be nice, ironically (not really irony at all but just funny) the only place in the club with paper towels is in the middle by the hand sanitizer station #weird

I was in need of a delicious meal to help me recover from Oktoberfest @tempe town lake.  A bagel sandwich seemed ideal so I searched yelp for everything bagels (cause I love everything bagels) and found this place.  Enthused and hazy from many beers the prior evening around noon I got the courage to leave my bed and make the journey to everything bagels.  I got their lox bagel sandwich on pumpernickel bread (The New Yorker) and iced americano and fresh squeezed orange juice.  Everything was great the lox was perfect the bagel was like a bagel should be not like that Einstein's BS, New York style FANTASTIC. The coffee was also good in fact I was going to give 4 stars but that rude woman who gave them 1 star because they don't have a cold brewed coffee is crazy, yes cold brewed coffee is delicious but coffee over ice is not terrible it was fine.  So to help boost their star rating they deserve I give 5 stars.  I will def be back again to try the other egg breakfast sandwiches, one more thing I got a Hawaiian bagel to go cause it sounded intriguing and it didn't let down it was like a kings Hawaiian roll in delicious bagel form!!!

I enjoy video games especially games of old yore, yes yore.  I had heard about fallout games and in my mind imagined an old Gamers or Electronic Boutique but perhaps crappier (imagine that, am i rite guys - cause they were both pretty bad) this due to the fact that old games get tossed and what not (never by me but people with no remorse or care or overall positive demeanor/ taste).  Either way I was BLOWN AWAY!!!!!  Its like taking a trip to Toys R Us in the 90's!  You know back when Toys R Us meant something.  They had "isles" of toys not a weird as circular layout and the video game area had a crazy 2 sided laminated cards, ROWS OF THEM, providing descriptions and screenshots of the game.  And if you wanted it you could purchase it.... with a paper sheet held inside a clear plastic envelope that on a good day you could convince your parent to bring up to the register.  This place is a blast in the past with games as far back as Atari and as new as the current gen consoles (ps3,Xbox 360, wii u ...JK WII U ISN'T NEXT GEN HAHAHA)  So next time your looking for a virtual boy or a 3DO version of "night trap" ( best version / full screen) hit up Fallout games, I cant say enough its as awesome as my run on sentences

I haven't wrote a review in a while so my apologies for not blessing the Yelp community with my fantastic experiences.  That being said I can't say enough positive things about my experience with this iPhone repair shop!  Basically the tip of my headphone jack broke off in my iPhone which is not only weird (as that has never happened to any electronic device I own over the course of my 30+ years on this earth) it's incredibly annoying.  I went to the Apple Store and they said that to replace that was a complete loss and there was nothing they could do but replace the entire phone for 400+!  I left discouraged and mildly gassy.  I started looking up stuff on the Internet and found that this is something that can be fixed by swapping out the circuit board that houses the headphone jack and charging port.  I could buy the part for somewhere around $30 but I'm sure I would break the phone in the process which for a lack of better term would "blow".  I hit Yelp and found this place hidden in that crazy strip mall west of Scottsdale and Shea - they charged a reasonable $60 to replace the part.  It took an hour and my phone is fixed and even charging a little faster!    They offer a range of repair services for iPhone and Android- if you are one of THOSE PEOPLE (jokes).  Affordable, fast and professional- I can't recommend this place enough!

Ok so bar louie I went there a year ago and it was bad, wait not bad I mean the women dressed like whores with side boob pouring out was hilarious to look at! ( I mean if you weigh that much I know its hard for clothes to contain you but then stay home ) On the other hand the waitress with track marks on her arm and 30 min between visits was less than stellar.  Either way the place was bad and now its closed but more hilarious is the picture I posted of " bar closed " written on a cocktail napkin, oh westgate aside from the scumbags that gather your no Scottsdale.  Btw extra star was for funny people watching!
