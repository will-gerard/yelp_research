This was my third visit and it wasn't as impressive as the first time. Tonight (Saturday), there was only one server attending to a restaurant filled with customers. The term Udupi symbolizes authentic South Indian food. I ordered Masala Dosa and it was far from from its origin, and the iddli  was hard! Lassi on the other hand was the only thing I liked. The poor server was so busy running around that she even forgot our bill, and then when we waited for her at the counter, she calculated our total incorrectly! This dramatic change in their service is explained by change in management. No wonder! Anyways, I'm not sure if I'll be coming back.

If you're looking for a new pizzeria that offers pizza toppings that will leave you feeling a bit healthy without compromising on taste, then this is the place to be!

I tried Margherita Flatbread at lunch today. The strong scent of basil was refreshing. Melted mozzarella embraced my taste buds. Server was very kind and offered timely service. Overall, wonderful experience

Great coffee + friendly staff = 5-stars. Can't ask for more! Well...I can. Please open up a sit-in cafe. :)

Checked this restaurant out tonight and I'm pleased with their timely and yummy service. Mixed Grill with Rice dish tasted like it was made at home with minimal spices and not greasy at all. I can't wait to try other items from their menu.

My first visit won't be my last because that's how impressed I am with this new business. They have redefined freshness while offering a variety of popular Indian street food and desserts. It's the next "NEW THING" and everyone must try. I wish your team the very best AND see you soon!
