I've been waiting to cross the Farm Grill off my Yelp bucket list for a few years now! I'm over here in AZ visiting family so I finally had the chance to do just that  I had the Take Two foot long hot dog! It was great! I was told the dog was home made. It was top notch. I am the kinda guy who likes a dog to snap as you bite into it! The bun was great; tasted like it was home made and grilled.   My wife had the BBQ Chicken pizza. It was awesome. The bread used for the crust was definitely home made and had great texture.   The service was great! Very friendly staff! The place was super clean! We'll be back! I have two or three other items is like to try!

I have visited this TW&M a few times and really like it. The staff here are very knowledgable and are eager to help find specific items or help discover new ones. I definitely stop here during every visit to the area because of how great of an experience I have each time. They have everything under the sun when it comes to any type of alcohol. They also have a pretty good selection of cigars!!

I rarely leave a business because I'm fed up with waiting for service, but this store really is poorly established. I walked in and there are three or four employees working and they don't appear to care about customers what so ever. Yes, it was busy, yet they did little to make sure they were taking care of everyone in the store. Lack of training?  I had two pairs of shoes I was completely ready to purchase. Yet I couldn't even get an employee to help me find my size. I stood in the store waving to employees, asking directly for help and got nothing.   I now know what it feels like to be a ghost, because it was like no one could hear or see this willing customer. There are so many stores here to buy shoes, that I believe that if you want to be successful, you need to step it up and perform. Unfortunately, this visit ended with a less than satisfied customer who took his business elsewhere...   I'll be back! Hopefully it's a little different next time!

Initial thoughts upon sitting down with a beer and hitting my first 15 shots: holy cow, I want to build one of these for myself!   Getting to the nitty gritty of the review and thinking of the questions people would ask before visiting my review becomes a bit more specific.   #1 * The wait staff was hired yesterday. Or at least that is the view I had when asking a few very simple questions about the system used here. They seemed to have zero training on the system used and how to operate simple functions.   #2 * Our waitress was very eager to learn from us what we found out through trying it out.   #3 * Computer systems down. There were more error screens than you could imagine here. One of the staff even said the app has never worked here. That's pathetic. Get someone on it.   My review is sounding awfully negative (but it needed to be said, otherwise no one would know what can be improved upon), which doesn't at all reflect my experience here so the rest will be how much fun I had.   * Our waitress Michelle was amazing. It looks like she only had two tables, so you can't beat a ratio of 1:9. She was constantly making sure we were happy with what was on our table.   * The music varies a ton! A good thing! I enjoyed listening to the cult classics and party music.   * OMG The food! The food was top quality. Worth twice what it costs. No joke.     It is blatantly obvious I'm a bullet/list reviewer so here are my key points.  *Technology- 6/10 train staff and hire an IT person.  * Staff- 10/10 Some of the most friendly and eager staff I've seen around. Keep it up.  * Food- 10/10 Id come here just to eat. Period.  * Overall experience- 9/10 This place was a blast. I plan on visiting as often as I can when in the area. It is totally worth every penny.
