WOW!!! This was the great experience i've ever had when buying a car. I knew the car i wanted and they helped me get a great deal on it. They even took money off even though it was already below the retail value. They never once asked me about a down payment and they got me a great warranty. I didn't even tell them that i needed the car that day but they got me in and out in less than an hour. This place is a blessing i would highly recommend it to anyone I know and if i ever need another car. Also if they don't have what you need, Karma Cars in the same area were very cool and helpful. Love this place.

I just moved to Surprise and I was trying to find a new barber shop. As soon as I walked in I was greeted like they knew me. A little bit of a wait and John cut my hair. It was great and from that first one I knew it was the place to go. I have now gotten my hair cut by both John and Rene and they both do a great job. I would recommend this place to anyone whether you live in Surprise or not.

Wow this theatre is awesome! Right when you walk into the room you can tell the seats are gonna be amazingly comfortable. The room was very quaint so there werent too many people. I ordered a spicy black bean burger that was soooo good! You have to see a movie here you wont regret it. Also i used a Groupon and i heard they have alot so stay on the lookout for that.

Wow cannot believe all these people gave this 4 stars. I give it 2 stars only because of the super low price. The seats were unbearable (Fast 6 which was 2 hours 10 minutes), the sound and video were absolutely horrible (made me think it was just a huge tv), we could hear the loud projector in the back the whole movie, and if anyone said anything you can hear them loud and  clear. I wanted to like this movie because of the price and you can come see movies for a second time or the ones you didn't want to shell out big bucks for but I won't be coming back. If your fine with all the negatives I put then hey this may be the theater for you but you've been warned.
