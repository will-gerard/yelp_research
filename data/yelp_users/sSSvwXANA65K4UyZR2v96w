I've been here a few times when transporting patients. The staff is super friendly and they always have snacks (like cookies) and coffee available. The waiting area is nice and very comfortable. The bathrooms are always posh and super clean. The last time we went, the staff actually drove us too and from our hotel in a big SUV (lots of room for our luggage and all the people we were with). They were happy to accommodate us. I look forward to working with Cutter in the future.

Love this place! Check it out if you are staying anywhere near the strip. The live music is guaranteed to be great. The DJ at night is always spot on with very current music. I've danced the night away more than once here. It's open and airy, and you're surrounded by fun people. Good times to be had!

This place is very close to the airport. My company put me up for the night here, so I can't comment on the price. But the accommodations are nice. We got the exec suites I think. When we arrived at about 10:30 at night, there was a bit of hassle at the front desk..but it got sorted out. The bar stayed open a little late for us, which was cool. The room was nice and clean. The bed was super comfy and I literally fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. The only nit-picky thing I can think of was the room didn't have the black out curtains. The curtains that they have are basically see through...which could be an issue for obvious reasons. But it wasn't a huge issue for me. We ate breakfast at the restaurant that is a part of the hotel and the food was good :). I would stay at the Radisson Hotel Phoenix Airport again.

Not a bad place, but really pricey (even for an airport). I had a margarita and a shrimp taco plate with about 1/4 cup of rice and 1/4 cup of black beans. The shrimp tacos were ok, with melted cheese and a little bit of cabbage. But they definitely left me wanting something. The margarita was good, but not very strong for the price I paid. I would have probably rathered have a glass of wine or a beer. Not a bad place to have a meal, but not great either.

Well...it's the Las Vegas Strip...the sinner's....mecca...the drinker's resivour....the gambler's haven. It's fun...for awhile. There is tons to do and see, even if you are being good. The street performers are awesome. There's good food and booze to be had. It's definitely the tourists' part of Vegas...and there's nothing wrong with that. Enjoy!

This place is part of the Radisson Hotel Phoenix Airport. The service was decent and the food was good. I had a healthy breakfast wrap that featured quinoa, egg whites, feta cheese, and spinach. It came with a side of fruit. Yum! I would eat at this place again.
