Went here for dinner on July 3rd.  Great place to hang out for best firework show I have seen in Az (in my opinion).  Place was busy so I would to give our server a break but she vanished!!! Their management is too blame in our opinion.  We found out she was working tables all over the restaurant.  They need to section the restaurant off better for their servers.  They have people running all over the place doing their best but not really serving the customers.   The Cobb salad was surprisingly good as was the chili.  If you like greasy.. Go for the fried chicken.

Feel like I just walked into the city of brotherly love! Amazing cheesesteaks and friendly people who go way out of their way to serve you with a smile!

Great breakfast. Great cozy atmosphere with friendly people.  We had the green chili omelette. Can't even describe how great it is! Also shared some pancakes. Their pancakes are to die for!

Found these guys to be a little more expensive than most but I kind a like it.  They give better treatment to the car

Celery is the best thing on the menu. Over priced and really not as great as it used to be.

Great hummus.  I judge by he hummus and I am satisfied.  My wife had the Greek salad. Loved it.  We weren't crazy about the garlic sauce.

Tacos were amazing.  We loved the salsa bar.  They kept the tacos coming and our tab open.  We just kept going back for more. Thinking Christmas dinner here next year!

This place is starting to grow on me. I love the back patio open air seating. The coconut shrimp is off the hook!
