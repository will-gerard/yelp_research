I went to this practice at the recommendation of a friend. The initial appointment went really well and I was very optimistic about finding what I perceived to be my family's new practitioner. That was early November. In the following 8 weeks, the front desk staff bungled five appointments and I have yet to have a second appointment.  They accused me of missing an appointment when they had written down the wrong date on my card. The second time, I was told again that I came on the wrong day. The last two times I was told at the desk at check in that "we tried to reach you but your practitioner is out of state."  I am a patient person, but this is ridiculous!

The staff here are amazing. They repeatedly exceed expectations in both knowledge and service. I go there at least once a week and they never disappoint. The only time they did not have what I needed, they referred me to a local business that could help. Good, old-fashioned kind of store...reminds me of a better time.

Every aspect of working with Spotlight Signs and Imaging was exceptional. They exceeded all expectations; from the very first telephone call, through many meetings and discussions.. all the way to the point that the final product was delivered.  Everyone was professional. All questions were answered promptly and the product delivered was awesome!    It was important for us to use a local business and it really paid off.
