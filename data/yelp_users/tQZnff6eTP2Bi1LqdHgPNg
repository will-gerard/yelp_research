This place often doesn't have enough staff or if they do only one register is going. Took us more than fifteen minutes to check out each time.

I love this place!  Ask for it to go and you'll have left overs for days.  You can mix sauces to create any flavor you like.  Watch out though, it can get really hot or spicy if you put too much in!  Great for groups, family or a easy date time.

Our experience at Yupha's was bomb dot com.  The menu is a little intimidating at first since every dish has its authentic Thai name, but the numbers next to them helped.  We asked for some dishes to be spicy while others not to be and it turned out great.  The spicy dishes gave a kick wile the mild ones still gave a full flavor.    I suggest to order by the numbers though, since there is sometimes a little lost in translation.  All together I really suggest Yupha's, especially if you are sharing amongst a large group!

Great, fun place to grab some healthy food in Ahwatukee. Double check their specials and the seasonal beers. There's some good stuff here. Also, happy hour is a great time to try out all the apps!

We live a few miles away and bike here or drive by after work. The beer is great, the food is phenomenal and the staff is always the best. They've been getting very popular lately, so if you don't want to wait 15 minutes for a table during peak meal times, stop whining and get fast food instead. If you aren't looking to whine over nothing, stop by this place for a beer, food or overall company. We'll keep coming back. -@collin_reed

Food came out 15 minutes apart. Half the table was done with their food before the rest came. The waitress has been gone for 30 minutes. Waiting on drink refills. Two orders came out wrong and we asked for the sides to fix it. They haven't been back to fix anything. If this was the first time it wasn't good, maybe we consider it a fluke. Third time this has happened out of the last six we've been here...Yea, not coming back.

Just moved in around the corner with my wife and was looking for some thai food. Wowza! So excited to find a legit thai place in our new neighborhood! Staff was very nice and got us to go stuff that was hot as Hades even when we got home. Expect more photos of these dishes from us, we're going back soon and often.
