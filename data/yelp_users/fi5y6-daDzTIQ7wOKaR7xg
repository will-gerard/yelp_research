This is a great place to drop in for a quick lunch.  Everything is served buffet style, so you can arrive and immediately start eating.  I would give 5 stars, but the service is super slow and getting some naan bread brought to your table can be a chore.

Hillstone is a great restaurant.  It has consistently good service and food.  The artichoke appetizer is definitely my favorite!  Hillstone is always busy and for the longest time would not take reservations.  Now they do accept reservations and it is worth your time making one.  I have eaten just about everything on the menu at one point or another and it is all good.  From sushi to the appetizers to the entrees you are good.  In my opinion, this place is priced fairly for what they offer.

This is the single best restaurant in Arizona. I have been here several times and it is consistently delicious. Eating at the chef's island is lots of fun, Chef Marcellino is great. The servers are on the ball. This restaurant is 5 star.

I have been a patient of Dr. Michael Wolff and Gretchen Post, PA at Southwest Spine and Sports for over 8 years.  I have spent 10s of thousands of dollars with the practice.  In the past I have received good service from the medical staff, however, the treatment has gone down hill quickly.  First I will start off with the front desk girls and the phone staff, they are terrible.  Out of all the medical practices I have been to, only once have I seen staff worse.  They are almost completely incompetent.  Dr. Michael Wolff and Physician's Assistant Gretchen Post used to be very caring doctors who would do whatever they could in a timely fashion for their patients.  The practice has obviously grown too fast and is so large, that the doctors think they are Gods and walk around with an unbelievable aloofness.  I guess they are so busy and wealthy now, that they can afford to not even return a long time patients phone call in a time of need.  If you are looking for a pain doctor, I would look somewhere else.  Stay far away from Southwest Spine and Sports, they are highly egotistical and could care less about their patients.

I have been eating at Mi Patio for many years.  This place may be one of the best Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix.  The Baja Chicken Burro is awesome.  From the outside the place looks like a dump, but the inside is cool and more importantly the food is great with consistently friendly service.

I was in the area for a business meeting and a co-worker and I went in to grab a quick lunch.  The service was quick which is about the only positive thing you will read in this review.  Upon being taken into the front room to be seated the first thing I noticed was the extreme heat.  I alerted the hostess to the issue and she said that it was a hot room and would seat us elsewhere.  The other bigger room was cooler, but far from comfortable.  I am sorry but not having good air conditioning in Tempe/Phoenix is unacceptable.  Figuring we could manage the heat, we ordered guacamole to start.  I am an avocado lover and consequently eat guacamole all the time.  I have NEVER seen guacamole like this before.  It looked puke green and was completely pureed, the consistency of liquidy sour-cream.  In addition to the guacamole, we also ordered a quesadilla.  How hard is it to make a decent quesadilla? Whatever the case, Rosita's quesadilla was cold, hard, and seemed like it was just reheated from the day before.    We paid without eating 98% of the food.  I will never return to Rosita's. Disgusting hot dump.

Probably the best Chinese food in Arizona.  I would easily give 5 stars if the place was a little cleaner.  I was especially disgusted with their filthy bathroom.

Some friends recommended me to this place.  The bottom line is that if you are in the area and are hungry, you have to try this place at least once in your life.  It is an interesting bar setup inside and the hot-pockets/Pastys are so good. The portion size is pretty good too.  I was with a friend and we shared a few appetizers and one pasty and left pretty full.

This is a great Mexican food restaurant. I eat here for lunch once a week and have never had a bad meal. The "Asada y Enchilada" is my favorite dish. If you are an avocado lover like me,  this is the place to go. I always order extra avocado because they have the best and ripest avocados I have had anywhere.

Julia Baker has some of the best and most expensive chocolate anywhere in AZ.  The Milk Chocolate Carmel (almost $2.00/ea) are delicious.  You have to eat them all in one bite or they get very messy.  They also have chocolates with cake in them.  They are bite size and cost $3.50/ea.  They are so good.  They also have excellent hot chocolate.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for their coffee.  They say they have great Arabian coffee, but as a coffee connoisseur, I can tell you it is straight up crap.  In all honesty, it tasted like chemicals.  I had to throw my cup in the garbage.

This is by far my favorite lunch spot. It is a great way to go out for lunch and still stay healthy. The vegetables and fruits are all extremely fresh. I usually start out with the Vegetable Crudites with tzaziki sauce. For the main course I get the Bison Burger protein style with no cheese and a side of fruit.   The staff are super friendly and attentive. I recommend this place to all my friends and make sure to take visitors from out of town.

Love the coffee, espresso, and the establishment.  They also have awesome scones.  The owners try to remember all names and faces and are always super friendly.  This place is real close to my office, so I try to stop in at least once a day for a coffee or espresso.

This past week my wife opened the garage door and the entire belt came off.  I searched Yelp to find a good company to fix the problem and found A1.  Matt H showed up the same day I called and determined that the entire gear system broke inside the Liftmaster garage door opener.  Shortly after seeing Matt the owner Tommy stopped by with the parts and fixed the opener and reattached the belt.  These guys were super efficient and unbelievably inexpensive.  I thought for sure I would have to buy a completely new opener, but A1 was very honest and addressed the problem with no hard sales tactics.  To say the least, my wife and I are super impressed with A1 Garage Door Repair.

My wife and I, whom live in Grayhawk, visited the Local Bistro last night.  We ordered the Caprese Salad, Beef Carpaccio, Steak Frites, and a Chicken Parmesan Cobb Salad.  Once we placed our order we were notified that the Caprese Salad was sold out.  **If you like thick, chewy roast beef, get the Beef Carpaccio.  I can't say enough bad things about it.  **If you want even chewier meat that is impossible to swallow, get the Steak Frites.  **If you want an unpalatable Chicken Parmesan Cobb Salad, this is definitely the place to go.  To further my anguish, Local Bistro does not have toothpicks, so you can't even get the chewy meat out of your teeth.  There were a few good points to the restaurant, the wait staff seemed friendly and the inside of the restaurant is clean and neat.  Unfortunately for Local Bistro, my $51.00 check was way over priced.  I don't mind paying a pretty penny for good food, but being that I chose not to eat my entire meal, I left hungry.  I feel that Local Bistro will have the same future as Eddie Chan's (who had way better food) which was the last restaurant that occupied that space.  If you feel like spending $50 on a meal for two people without drinks, there are many better options within a mile radius.

Pool Daddy has been servicing my pool for over a year now and I get excellent service.  Not once have I received a bill that I wasn't anticipating.  George, the owner, is very good about calling first to make sure I authorize any repairs or unforeseeable charges.  I haven't had much luck with a few other pool services that I felt did absolutely nothing.  I would definitely recommend Pool Daddy to friends and family.

Very cool building, architecture and atmosphere.  This place is super close to my office and a great place to go for a quick lunch.  Taco Guild has some of the most interesting Taco combos I have seen anywhere.  My favorite are the Shrimp Tacos.  If you are really hungry, don't miss the street corn.  The tacos are a bit pricey, but it is definitely worth trying.

Snooze AM is certainly one of the best breakfast spots in Arizona.  The service is great and friendly.  No matter if you get eggs, the famous pancakes, or french toast, it will be delicious.  I take all my friends and clients to this place and everyone always loves it.

Prior to today I thought the only place to get a decent gyro in Arizona was this restaurant in Scottsdale.  I found this amazing gem with a few people I work with today and had a feast.  Nino himself actually personally took care of us.  We ordered Spanikopita and Cheese Fries as an appetizer which were both delicious.  The Cheese Fries had two cheeses, one of which was freshly ground feta.  So good!  Next we had Gyro sandwiches with a huge side salad, all of which was delicious.  Being a lover of gyros, I must admit that the meat was extra tender and flavorful.  Lastly, Nino brought us out very tasty baklava.  I will be back to Nino's in the future.  It was a great experience today and I am glad I found the joint.

I have been a patient of Arizona Asthma & Allergy Institute since the age of 3.  Now my 4 year old son is a patient as well.  Dr. Mittel runs the location on 32nd St and Camelback.  The office is new, clean, and beautiful.  There is a big allergy shot waiting room.  Dr. Mittel aggressively treats asthma issues and is also trained in dealing with kids with special needs.  I would recommend this practice to anyone with asthma or allergies.  You will be happy you found this place.

I have crappy tooth genetics.  I have had so much dental work in my life I have totally lost track.  I also have been known to attract some of the worst dentists.  This year I thought it would be good to get a fresh start with a completely new dentist and leave the chain I was previously going to that had new doctors every time I went.  Instead of hunting around online or calling my insurance company, I sought out a friend who is in the dental field.  My friend recommended me to Dr. Hughes and I couldn't be happier.  I had my first day of major dental work today (two crowns and 4 cavities).  Dr. Hughes has the newest Cerec machine that actually makes the crowns at the office while you wait.  It is great to go in and leave with your real crowns the same day instead of the temporary business I have dealt with in the past (cubic zirconia strength crowns).  He also has another cool machine that keeps your mouth open, your tongue depressed, and does the suction at the same time.  The cool part about this system is that the dental assistant doesn't have to be in your mouth suctioning and spraying while the dentist is also working.  There are a few other points I would like to touch on, namely very friendly and informative staff as well as a super clean office.  The people that work there couldn't be nicer.  I was there for so long today, I missed lunch and my blood sugar dropped a bit. The next thing you know, the dentist, Dr. Hughes, was serving me a piece of cake from Paradise Bakery.    I have finally found a great dentist and plan on sending my family and friends.
