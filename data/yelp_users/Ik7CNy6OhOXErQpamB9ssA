I hadn't been here for several months the place I original wanted to go was closed. What a massive mistake this turned out to be. Why? Food poisoning! I've been violently ill, from a veggie burger. It seemed a little soggy, but sometimes that's just how they are. This destroyed my evening and entire day. Thanks White Chocolate. How about get your sh*t together?! To say I'm furious, would be an understatement. Poor service or something of that nature is excusable. Making someone extremely ill because of carelessness in the kitchen is NOT. I will never return, the thought of walking through the door alone makes me sick.

Spinach con queso always resembles baby vomit, so it better taste exceptional. I could have made this at home, with a box of Velveeta and a can of spinach. Gross. Salsa, eh so so, on the soupy side. It's never a good sign when you walk into an establishment and wait 30 seconds, wondering if you should just seat yourself. I was generous by giving two stars, my cocktail was tasty and they had my favorite candy, which I took a handful of upon my departure. I won't be going back.

I've been storing my furniture here for a few months now. They are conveniently located and very reasonably priced. My unit was clean and the people were very friendly. If you don't have a lock, you can purchase one in the office. They close a little earlier than expected, but that's not really an issue. Fast, friendly and affordable. Can't beat that:)

I went in today for the cool sculpting. The staff is very informative and welcoming. Cleanliness is very important to me and this place is sparkling. During my treatment I was made very comfortable and cozy. I even got to watch a movie! I can't say anything about results because this type of treatment takes time. I'm returning on Monday to get the Vela Shape. I can't say enough good things about the staff. Great experience and I'm looking forward to my next treatment!

So, I went in for my follow up and I'm amazed. I gain four pounds since my procedures, but I look THINNER than my first visit. I don't know why anyone would undergo liposuction, when this is available. The cool sculpt did exactly what it was supposed to, shrank my thighs:) The VelaShape smoothed everything. It's perfect if your at your ideal weight but you just want the little extra toned look.

One star because, the only thing I liked about the food was the chunky salsa. The place was clean, but it was also empty. I wanted to like this place, but it was some of the worst Mexican food I've eaten. As soon as you walk in the door, you have to grab a menu, which I had to hunt for and the employees seemed to have no clue as to what's what. I asked for salsa and the boy behind the counter let me know salsa comes with the meal. It doesn't, it's hot sauce. Big difference. So, I had to ask again. This time I asked for chunky salsa, which you have to pay for. Not an issue, just know the difference. I mean, we live in Arizona, for crying out loud! I won't go back.

Just had an amazing dinner here. The chopped salad was beautiful and delicious, had every component a salad should have. The service was impeccable, so attentive and informative. Brad was our waiter, not only good looking, but considerate of our palates. I highly recommend the crab cakes, one sniff made my mouth water and when that first bite hit my tongue...heaven!!! Thank you Citizen Public House for a fantastic dining experience. Will be back for more, most definitely.

This place is last resort. I work nearby and sometimes need a quick fix. The juice...always a disappointment, protein bowl, eh it's oooookaaay. The best thing about this place, it's within walking distance. I've had better.

I used a Groupon here, and was a bit apprehensive because (like most ladies) I'm picky about my hair. I was pleasantly surprised! Tina was my stylist, she was sweet as pie, nailed my color and all in good timing. It's important to me to have a stylist who not only wants to get the color correct, but also holds concern for the health of my hair. I was so happy with her performance, I booked my next appointment before I left. This is not a trendy, overpriced, pretentious salon. The staff genuinely friendly and take pride in their work. I was happy to get a break with my Groupon, but will be more than happy to pay full price on my next visit. Walking out of a salon 100% pleased is priceless.

Tina is the best!!! Nails my color and the cut is ALWAYS perfect! Make sure to book in advance because she is a busy little lady:)... Her suite is private and she provides plenty of snacks and beverages! Great experience all the way around. Thank you Tina for being wonderfully attentive and stellar at what you do!

I love this place! I'm a Phoenix native and maybe a bit of an enthusiast. I love the mobiles above the bar, all things AZ. Such a fantastic idea. The secret room made me feel like I was stepping back in time. Our waiter, Angel was amazing. My favorite cocktail was the Rose Mofford. Light and floral. Very feminine. I went here to see a show, the venue is a bit narrow, but it was a nice intimate experience. I really appreciate the speakeasy vibe and the fact that it's in the basement. Must check this place out, if you can find it ;)

I was so excited when I found this place! I ordered Drunken Noodles and Spicy Fried rice, both level "hot". The flat noodles are my favorite! They don't deliver but offered free veggie spring rolls for the inconvenience and they are delicious! I hope people find this place and fall in love. I did not dine in, but it was clean and I was greeted with a smile. Looking forward to my next visit and I'll definitely let my friends know about this little gem.
