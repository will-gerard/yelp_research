I think the fanfare for Four Peaks is obvious...and for good reason. Brewery right? So, this means "bar food"? WRONG. The food is to die for. I get the Salmon BLT religiously, the BBQ Chicken Pizza is awesome, the Nachos are HUGE (add the blackened chicken and thank me later), and the specials are usually damn good also.   I've probably been here 40 times (conservative number) and while the service can be lackluster, I cannot give them less than 5*. When I say the service is "iffy" it really depends on the server. Some are amazing. One guy I've had multiple times frankly does not give a $hit. And other times, they can just get overwhelmed (this place get packed wall-to-wall, so I can understand some lapses).   The beers...AMAZING. If you want to get tipsy, go straight for the Raj IPA. A tasty, hoppy beer that will get the job done. I tend to like bitter beers like IPAs, so I stick to the Raj, HopKnot, and 8th Street. I do like Kiltlifter (probably their most popular beer) but it can start to get too sweet after a few.   One thing many people fail to mention; order a glass of water. I know water doesn't sound impressive, but they pour the same distilled H20 they use in their beers and it is the best water in Arizona. Just a thought.

If you want to go to a busy bar in Tempe, there are better options than Zuma. This place is no bigger than the closet in my guest bedroom and smells like the dank socks that I forgot were in my gym bag (probably due to the fact that the A/C can't keep up with the occupancy and everyone is sweating like an Olympic wrestler caught in a half-Nelson). I would like to say service is slow, but it might only seem that way since I always have to battle my way up to the bar (see closet comment ^^^). All-in-all, I really don't like this place at all and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.   BUT, the female talent in here is usually pretty good, so I give it 2* and may even go back haha.

Congratulations Bar Louie! Another 2* Review. Apparently, that's what you're aiming for. I went in tonight after I got off of work for a beer and some food, primarily because my brother had mentioned he thought the place looked cool about a week ago. Do not get it twisted; this place may appear busy on Wednesdays and any other day from 4-7 for one reason only, their happy hour prices are nice.   Their bar staff on the other hand can make Stephen Hawking seem like he has a bubbling personality. I'm a young single guy that eats out alone quite a bit because my work hours leave me eating past a normal dinner hour. I also worked industry for 6 years, so I know a bartender who's destined to work back of the house when I see one. My bar"tender" Crystal had zero personality, ZERO. I counted 5 singles and two deuces at the bar-top and she didn't engage one person in any conversation. Just pacing, making drinks, and complaining to coworkers.   Was a Wednesday night around 7:45 a little too much for you to handle (nine people, that's almost double digits...)? Need a second bartender up there? Or maybe just some Midol? Didn't receive a "hello" when I sat down, a smile with service, or a "thank you" when I was leaving. But, I did leave 20% because I know the industry and I almost felt sorry for her poor attitude.   The bottom of their receipt says "Thank you for your business. We hope to see you again soon." Maybe they should tell their FOH employees to try to make people feel like they actually mean it.   Food: Meh Atmosphere: Decent Staff: Unimpressive

What can I say? Raymundo is the man.  The business number listed is his personal number. In my opinion, that speaks worlds about the confidence he has in his work and his employees. Being a local investor, we have used this crew on multiple jobs, and have yet to be disappointed in any work done. No BS, their bids are consistently lower than other granite contractors, their fabrication is timely, and they show up on schedule for installs. As an investor, our biggest headaches come due to failed deadlines and chasing competitive bids. If you have the same experiences, call Raymundo. He's a good dude with a good business and I want to spread the word.  I'll even put my name on it...

I was here at 9 and according to Yelp and Google, they were "Open". According to the locked door and the stacked chairs they were not open. I guess I'll wait around a while...  Doors opened at 10 after and didn't get my bowl until 9:35 due to the one employee and line of 20 people. I think I'll pass on coming to this location. The Gilbert one has plenty of help and seems to open on time.

My only experience at this location was pretty bad. I've eaten at the Stately location a few times and always felt like Roadhouse was a decent place to get a good steak without spending too much. Now, I'm not so sure. We were in on the 4th hoping to grab a good holiday meal.  I ordered the 12 oz. ribeye, medium-rare and the steak that came out was thin, charred, and far overcooked. Dark grey interior and dry char on the plate when I cut it open. I'm used to ribeye being a thick cut, well marbled cut and this was neither.   They replaced my steak with a NY strip, telling me the ribeye is "hard to cook" and the strip is a thicker cut. A while later, the strip came out to pair with my cold sides and empty Arnold Palmer. While it looked to be properly cook, for some reason it sat glistening on the plate like they dumped water on it to add juice. And that's how it tasted. No salt, no pepper; a slab of flavorless meat.   My friends finished eating well before me, and the checks were dropped before I finished "enjoying", going me to consume the leather and sawdust that was in my mouth. I was surprised to look at the bill. They didn't comp anything, didn't offer to buy my appetizer, no offer for dessert, and actually charged me more for the strip than my initial order. Good up-sell inattentive server. That was $40 I'll never get back.  Happy 4th of July everyone!
