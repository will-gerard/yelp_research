Awesome sandwich shop and deli with a nice selection of kitchen items and wines to browse while you wait. There are two floors of seating in addition to a bunch of outdoor seating options so finding a spot was never a problem.  Daily sandwich specials for around 6$, regular sandwich prices around around 7-8 (still cheap) So far I've had the honey ham on sourdough and the mini genoa salami sandwhich. The sourdough bread here is super soft and wonderful with a nice chewy crust. Defintely recommend it!

Needed to make some copies of forms and my passport for an application and needed to get it done stat. Opened up Yelp to find a local place nearby.  First place that wasn't Fedex or Kinkos was JC Printing. They didn't actually offer personal copying service but did point me to Copy Works right next door.   Stopped by was helped right away and was out the door in about 2 minutes. Total cost for 4 b&w copies was 40 cents. It was so cheap I felt bad taking my change, but there was no tip jar. So I guess I'll show my appreciation with a little Yelp love.   They also offer business cards, wedding invitations, and brochure printing for those with more commercial printing purposes. Apparently also offer pick up and delivery, so they'll come to you, which is nice.

I've been here twice now on visits to Madison and each experience was awesome. Never that long of a wait, great location next to the capitol building, and a varied menu of 'wisconsin fare'.  Based on my limited exploration of the menu, I can confidently recommend the house burger and the brandy old fashioned.  The house burger has bacon, cheese, and an egg on it... so it was almost a guaranteed winner. Add a few adjectives in front of those ingredients (e.g. berkshire or aged) and you've got yourself a slamdunk dish.  The Old Fashioned's are surprisingly strong and sweet without being coyingly so, I had two and needed an afternoon nap. (an admission you probably shouldn't make around Wisconsin folk, they will judge your lack of alcohol tolerance as a sort of moral failing.)

It's the DMV for dyslexics!  Just kidding (and that's not even funny probably just offensive to persons with dyslexia so I apologize)  Why 4 stars for the DMV? Because even though it legit smelled in there, I was in and out in a reasonable amount of time and no one was rude to me. Also, you can adapt to the smell after a while.  Their ticketing system didn't seem to follow any logical ordering system, so just pay attention. Bring a book and pen and you'll survive.

Astonishingly bad.   I came here for a foot reflexology massage on a friend's recommendation. The therapist was a young kid who must've just started, or maybe it was like bring your child to work day and he decided to pitch in.  [Edited out play by play for clarity]   All in all, the whole experience was awful. I'm probably partly to blame here for not saying anything during the whole experience, but I was honestly in a state of shocked silence.   I also normally don't write a one-star review based on a single negative experience, but the level of oversight here on the management's part is astounding. Clearly, my massuese had no formal training or certification, and no one took the time to even show him how to give a proper massage before letting him loose on clients. People could be injured.  In summary, I don't even know what point I'm trying to make here. I'm just processing a bizarrely bad experience. As far as take-aways for my readers: if you do decide to go here, make sure you get someone who knows what they're doing...

5 stars for the salted dulce de leche shake here. Probably one of the many reasons I will never see a six pack on my body, but I'm okay with that. Seriously, the sweet and salty combo of this shake soothes my soul.   The burgers not bad either. Although I wouldn't be upset if an in n out were to move into Arcadia.

I'm pleased to see that the tech industry's obsession with adverbs has now spilled over into the hospitality industry. Gladly joins the rareified ranks of weebly, optimizely, bitly, and every sub-domain registered in Libya.   True to form they've adopted a semi hispter modern aesthetic, clean cool lines with just a touch of texture here and there and a few potted succulents to bring some life to it all. Coming from Williamsburg, I was a big fan of the interior/ambiance.  Cocktails here also seem to be something you come for. The bartenders all know what they're doing (and probably refer to themselves as mixologists.) The Manhattan was execellent, boozy but sweet enough to be highly drinkable. The Mule was a big winner as well, spruced up with a bit of seasonal herbs that elevated the whole drink quite nicely. I was a little off put by the mixing of multiple high quality whiskeys in one drink, it seemed a little sacriligeous, but I'm sure it's delicious.   Foodwise the big winners were:  The Original Chopped Salad* Seared Spicy Tuna Seared Scallops Duck meat loaf  The seared spicy tuna app, had a mix of sweet, savory, and spicy elements that were just fantastic. Like they should expand this item out into a full blown salad and I would eat the shit out of it.  Scallops were super high quality, large, and the bed of grits really won me over.   The duck meat loaf honestly was just a fancy meatloaf, but it was an incredible amount of food, so if you're going for value this is not a bad choice. I couldn't finish even half of it.  Speaking of value, their happy hour specials here (3-6pm daily) look ridiculous. I'll definitely have to come back for that. As well, seating on a Friday night at 7pm wasn't an issue, so that's always nice.  *The originality of this chopped salad seems to be a point of local debate, which I have no interest in entering into. So I'll just point that out and promptly exit the debate.

I came here with a friend who almost as rule gets bottle service. I'm obviously not on that level. But I'm happy to tag along if that's your jam. And frankly, if you're coming here with a group, that's probably your best bet. Not that expensive and ensures you'll have a nice space, easy access to drinks all night, and no dickery from bouncers.   Also do your best to get a table outside.   Music was good, place was bumpin, and everyone was attractive. I think that's all you can really ask for out of a bar/club.
