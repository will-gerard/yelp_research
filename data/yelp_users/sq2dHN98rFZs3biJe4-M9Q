We waited 1.5 hours for a burger and chicken sandwich and I did not see the cow or the chicken in the back.  There were only 12 people here.  The manager comped us our meal and gave us free dessert - which was nice.  The burger was bland, the chicken sandwich dry, and the dessert banana pudding was gross.  This was 100% miss for us.  This is our first DDD miss.  Guy F. What were you thinking, but hey, everyone has a bad day.

Tosh is was a DDD so we had high expectations and they came right through.  Our waitress was super cool, food was great turkey Tom and the wife had roasted pork with stuffing, only cow that was good.  We got stuffed so we could not have any of those divine desserts in the case, all made on premises.  We'll probably go back today to par-take.  Worth the trip and scarf it down!!!

The facility is good and I rated it two stars because they want you to pay $9.95 for Wi-Fi.  I cannot stand being nickeled and dimed like that.  Welcome to 2012 and throw that bad boy in for free.  Geez.  I would stay somewhere else just based on the Wi-Fi thing.  Staff is friendly and the room was clean and if Wi-Fi was free I would have given them a third or even fourth star, that's how Daddy rolls.

My wife and I loved it here.  Staff was excellent, room gorgeous, and across the street are sorts of things.  The room was overlooking the golf course and there was a large mirror on the wall (hubba-hubba).  I would love to go back right now... That's right, leave work and go back.

I am giving two stars when I would give one but the manager did the right thing.  First, my wife got a nut (the other end of a metal bolt) in her nachos.  Yep, you got that right, a metal bolt in her nachos.  The manager said it came off the fryer.  The manager comped our meal, which was the right thing to do, but whoa.  On the other end, I had the basic burger with cheddar, bland and boring.  I love a good burger and this just wasn't it.  Yes, a basic burger I did not expect to be wowed, but I was hopeful for a good.  It was boring, had little taste, and with all the burger places around, I need to be wowed.  Five Guys this is not.  The nachos, aside from the added metallic objects included, were bland as well.  Nachos are to have flavor and it just wasn't there.  Skip this one, there are other places to go.

This is a nice park and very big.  My wife and I were there for Festival in the Park and we had fun.

For an Embassy Suites this is lackluster.  The lobby is ncie and the breakfast is really good.  The room was old, the fridge did not work well (room 1030), and the area around the hotel is apparently very dangerous, s be careful if venturing out.  You had ot pay for WiFi, I hate being nickled and dimed.  Throw it in, geez.

I was in the Charlotte airport, which has really good WiFi for an airport, but I digress, and had some time so I thought I'd stop in, which I did, hence the review.  I ordered the fish and chips, stay way.  It is Tilapia and breaded to the gills (get it).  It was one piece of fish and the fries were fair.  They say the crab cakes are really good, but I have not had crabs since high school.  I will not return if I am in the airport again.
