As a person who regularly stays at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I consider 5 stars a big deal.  I stayed here, with my mom, for one night before staying 2 nights at said Ritz-Carlton, and I was upset that I didn't stay here the entire time.  The rooms at this resort far exceeded my expectations.  It's usually a timeshare type of place, so the full kitchen and separation of the bedroom was expected, but the enormous and luxurious bathroom was not.  I mean, the tub can easily fit two people AND has jets, and the shower is big enough to have a decent-sized party in!  Also, the sofa has a pull out, so the rooms are very accomadating.  This is by far the best place I've ever stayed in the Phoenix-Metro area.  I have a 3-night stay booked for the first weekend in September, and I can't wait!

I just dropped in to the Oly class, and this place is awesome! Luz is a great coach, and has a very good eye (of course, she's a former Olympian). I can't wait to join!

There's a reason this place has 5 stars, they're the best! Super speedy service, low prices, and a level of integrity I haven't felt anywhere else. If you are in the east central Phoenix area and own a Honda or Acura, do not take your car anywhere else; this is now the only place i will bring mine.  My only real complaint is that I didn't find them sooner!

Food is delicious AND healthy. Also, the bartender made great drinks and was super friendly and attentive.

I would love to rate their food, but we never got to try any.  My mother and I decided to try this place since we had a restaurant.com certificate and the reviews were pretty good. However, after about 20 minutes of waiting AND calling them from our table (yes, seriously) we never got any service, not even a glass of water! Maybe if we had brought a friend of Hispanic decent things would have been different.... Highly disappointed and offended.
