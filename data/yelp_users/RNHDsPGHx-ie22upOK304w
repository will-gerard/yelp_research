I have always heard good things about this place!  I have directed other people here, though I have only driven by it for past 9 years.  Well I found myself in their parking lot today so I wandered in for a bite. I got the salmon salad and it was very very good!  Many other.items on the menu that I want to try  so, I will be stopping by more often!

"The Mac's Attack"     I assure you this is not about Mc Donald's, But instead it is about Mac's Broiler and Tap in Tempe, Arizona  I actually crave food from here!  That all by itself says a lot!  I am a "foodie"  But I don't really crave any certain kind of food.  That is until I tried the "burger and a beer lunch special at Mac's Broiler and Taproom. At home my wife resticts us to white meat...Turkey, Chicken, Albacore Tuna.  One day a buddy and I tried out Mac's Broiler and Tap  6430 S. McClintock Dr. Tempe, AZ 85283  480-755-3050   Join their Fan page on Facebook It was a pleasant surprise!  Both of us thought the burger was the best we have had, I hear the French dip is also very good!  http://macsbroilerandtap.com/  I have been there three times in the last month and I am never disappointed,  The burger is cooked to a "Perfect Medium-Rare"  My favorite is the Jalpeno Buger, cajun fries and a pint of O'dells IPA.    The Sunday Breakfasts are fantastic too!                                                This place has ties that go back to  The Firehouse Restaurant that served great steaks to patrons of Tempe from their location on Apache Blvd. for many years.  If you live in the area stop by and give it a try.  If you visit Phoenix, make this a must do!  I wish I lived closer to Mac's!!!

Let me preface this by saying the Pizza and service are spectacular, five stars for those!  Why am I writing this and only giving one star?   For stupidity!  If the manager gave us a reasonable explanation then you wouldn't see this.  My mother ordered two shots of vodka on the rocks.  She requested two olives in it... Not an unreasonable request.  The bartender came over to the table and said "we don't have whole olives, will sliced be ok?"  Huh? A bar without whole olives? Perhaps they ran out?  Ok sure my mother said she would try sliced.  Presentation of the drink sucked...it came in a pint glass with the ice way above the vodka, no stir stick, and the olives? Were in a rocks glass, they weren't even queen olives, they were small sliced olives like you get on a pizza.  But I am not writing about the presentation of the drink.  We got the bill for our drinks, 2-16 inch pizzas, a 12 inch pizza a Pazookie and...here it comes 2 olives!  No shit! They charged us for condiments!  We had to ask why, as we have never been charged for having a lime in a beer, or 5 cherries in my daughters Shirley Temples, or olives anywhere in the world! The bartender never mentioned and extra charge for sliced olives. $0.39 each!  Now $6 a shot for vodka not unreasonable, even for rail! I am not upset about the $12 drink. The slap in the face is the charge for olives, that were not even whole!    So the manager (Carrie?) comes over and gives us some BS story that other places have figured the cost of the olives into their drink prices so that is why we have never ever seen this before anywhere in the world.    Hmmmm, how do those places know how many olives we are going to ask for? Or limes, or oranges or cherries.  You know I used three squirts of soap and three squares of hand towels when I used their restroom did I go over my limit on those? Think I should go back and have them add it to the bill?   I am only writing this because I was not satisfied with the reason given to me by the manager.  My mother ordered a $12 rail drink (not call) and had to pay for condiments. STUPID!  Dear Mark Russell, You have awesome people, great food, and service, however you need not charge for olives in drinks... Kind of stupid. Right?

Driving around looking for a place for lunch, found this by accident.  It was packed! Only two tables left open.  Quick warm welcome by staff, immediately had my drink and a delicious fresh, crisp salad with light dressing.   I ordered chicken green curry and it was great!  Very attentive wait staff! Fantastic lunch values!  I'm glad this is so close to where I now work!  I shall return

This place is GREAT!  I was greeted as soon as my foot hit the mat by the front door!  I mentioned that I was impressed with all the great reviews I saw on YELP, and that was what brought me to their shop. (I live in South East Chandler) The guy behind the counter was stoked that someone saw the reviews!  I purchased two Schwinn bikes for my daughters off Crags list, and felt they could use a good going over and tune up.  I got the gold tune up for both and when they did a quick assessment they told me I could pick them up the next day!  What I don't have to wait a week?  I'm not accustomed to such a quick turnaround!  That is great and the kids will be thrilled!  Very Polite, Very Knowledgeable, and Very Professional!  I will be back and I will send others!   I drove past many bicycle shops to get to The Pedal Bike Shop in Tempe and I will gladly do it again.
