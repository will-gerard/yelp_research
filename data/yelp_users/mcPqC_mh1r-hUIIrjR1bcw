Our group of four attended for "Restaurant week" as one of our group has always wanted to try. We got a late reservation and made the drive.  From the outside the place doesn't look like much and you might pass it by. The interior is well designed and decorated.  The food was all extremely delightful. This place is as much about the experience as it is the food.  We had several (6? 7?) courses and each was very small and presented perfectly. The food is not for the un-adventurous types. It is best described as French fusion/molecular gastronomy. We ended up full by the end but this is not comfort food nor heavy food.  We enjoyed the cheeses, the salmon vichyssoise, amuse bouche, lamb, hibiscus tea, frozen strawberry desert and macaroons. There were more but I lost count.  Each was served and explained in depth by the very courteous and attentive staff. Each was paired perfectly and the wine was explained in depth as well. This brings me to my next point. The staff was excellent. I had forgotten what truly excellent service is.  They made it a point to explain in depth each course. When they approached the table they allowed us to finish our table discussion and waited to be acknowledged rather than interrupting. They were friendly without trying to be our friend. This was very refreshing.  After nearly 2 1/2 hours our meal came to an end and it seemed like 15 minutes, which is testament to the pace and service as well as the food.  Word of caution, this is not the average establishment and they don't charge average prices. Expect $100/pp minimum. The dress while upscale was not pompous. There were suits and ties and ladies dressed well yet this is Cave Creek and there were Levis and boots as well.  I can whole-heartedly recommend Binkleys. Be adventurous and have some fun.

I have taken every vehicle I have owned here for the past 12 years. My latest car was recently rear ended and they did another fantastic job.  My car is a brand new Audi A5 and had was rear ended by a driver with no insurance. The damage looked minor but when they got the bumper off, rather than repair it they decided to contact my insurance to replace it since there was damage underneath.  The result is my brand new car is still a brand new car.  Every time I have taken a vehicle here they go way beyond what I expect to provide more than anyone should expect.  I have sent upwards of a half dozen friends here and we all share the same experience.  Vicki and her staff are helpful, friendly and professional.  No add on sales, just exactly what you need and want from a body shop.  Go here. period.

El Chorro has been in the valley for decades. This is where the wealthy old tourists and snow birds dine for a good meal in a beautiful setting.  The patio is wonderful, very old west/desert sky elegant. The drink menu is creative and original and changes frequently.  We ate here with a group of 9 and they were able to accommodate us easily. The watermelon gaspacho was interesting and flavorful and spicy. The steak was cooked near perfect for my taste and the au gratin potatoes were off the hook.  The wine list is expansive, many bottles in the $40+ range all the way up to several hundred dollars.  The service, while attentive, is very casual. Don't expect starched shirts and formalities.  The clientele as I stated is typically older, our table by far was the youngest in the restaurant with mostly 40 somethings and a few 30 somethings. Expect a lot of Tommy Bahama shirts and Rush Limbaugh conversations.  We dine here once a year or so due to the ambiance and good food. It is rather expensive so we like to keep it as a treat.  You can't really go wrong here for a nice meal.

I went during their opening week and despite the obvious challenges they faced while learning a new restaurant and concept and staff I went back because the food is off the hook good and cheap as hell.  Both times I got the half and half tortillas, I like the softness of the masa. I also got the chicken and short rib. The chicken is light and flavorful, the short rib is hearty and savory and smoky.  I chose the "Christmas" sauce, half red, half green. the green is fruity, light and refreshing while the red is super smoky and hearty. I like the red better and need to remind myself for next time but the two together make a nice contrast.  I got the cheddar cheese and then the guac and pico with the habanero on the side, its hot, and I mean hot. What I think is hot most people cannot eat. To me the habanero is edible but if you use too much you could ruin the meal.  My friend got the chicken and the mushroom and loved both. He also tried the jalapeno ranch dressing and it was awesome ( I stole some).  The first time we visited was their opening week and the wait was tough, the food ran out, the staff was over their heads.  This time the wait was non existent, the food plentiful and fresh and the staff orderly and efficient. What a difference a few months made!!  Some people complain of "chipotle with enchiladas", and the resemblance is there in the production line and the mexican flavor but thats where it ends. With the huge amount of choices and customization as well as the food being 10x as flavorful this is the clear winner.  The food is as flavorful as Richardsons or Barrio Cafe. no joke.  I am glad to see they worked out the bugs.  Eat here. Again and again.

I hate writing bad reviews. I hate it hate it hate it. But I really have only one good thing to say about this place.  Its in a great location and the patio will be awesome in the cooler weather.  As for the rest of the experience it was simply awful.  Before I start on the food, I have to complain about the service. All the servers help out with all the tables which usually works out but in this case it just meant that no one owned any table and everyone was left to languish. It took 40 minutes for our food to come. Our drinks were empty for 10 minutes at a time, several times. The coup de grace came while I was already getting irritated and the waiter walked to the end of the table while we were eating, exclaimed "pardon my reach" leaned in and reached past two of us to the opposite end of the table to pick up a napkin ring. When I said 'really/" he said "I SAID pardon my reach!". Classless. Walk around to the other end of the table. Its not that far.  Three of us dined and ordered different items.  A companion ordered the breakfast sandwich which is served on a croissant but since they were out of croissants they had to substitute a very bready mealy bread. Its a french cafe and they were out of croissants. Let that roll around in your head awhile. He didnt finish it. it was awful.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict. It was served on toasted baguette. Toasted so hard that if I wasnt so strong I wouldn't have been able to cut it. Chewing it was another problem altogether. I found it greasy and flavorless. The potatoes that came with it were of the crispy chunky frozen food variety.  Our third companion ordered the savory crepes with goat cheese and ham. This comes with a side salad. A side salad. Really. He enjoyed the crepes but was left hungry.   The quote that sums up the experience came on the way to the car "The best thing about that restaurant is the food is so bad we can now go get frozen yogurt!".   My advice, train your staff or hire new ones. Have more than two cooks on a Sunday Brunch. Order enough food so that you don't run out of the staples. Re-evaluate your menu and dishes.   Best of luck, I hope you make some changes and can pull this off.

Visited with a large group for "Restaurant Week". We were able to sit on the patio which I highly recommend if the weather is decent as it is tree covered which makes it very intimate,.  The service was simply amazing. Everything was prompt and all the dishes were explained very well.  The drink menu is nice, try the Margarita, made with chiles and awesomely spicy. The wine list is decent with some reasonable options.  Being restaurant week we were able to sample much of the menu. The burrata was a stand out as were the lamb polpettes. The flat iron Steak as an entree was amazing as was the pork chop was amazing fried in crispy polenta.  This was one of our favorite experiences for all the big "friend dinners" we have done.  The staff, ambience and food was just wonderful. Esquire Magazine rated Virtu as one of the top ten new restaurants in the country and it is not hard to see why.  Even with all that the prices are completely reasonable, especially for Scottsdale.  We simply loved it and will return soon!!
