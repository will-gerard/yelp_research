They would've been given 5 stars if it hasn't been for the horrible service given by my waitress. One of the managers helped me most of the time because he noticed she was ignoring me. Stetson chopped salad is by far one of the best salads I've ever had in my life! The mini mushroom dish was amazing, as well!! Two people could split both and be good to go-just FYI. Bartender made me a non-alcoholic mojito, which was great!! I would definitely come back, just hopefully served by a different person next time!

I had the pecan smoked salmon, and it was fantastic! Portion size was perfect for a light lunch. Nice atmosphere outside at a table by the bar.

I asked the server if I could get boneless grilled wings, and she said years so I ordered them. They came out as breaded and deep-fried balls that looked like hush puppies. So I told her I wanted grilled. She took them back to the chef, and brought them back and said "he three them on the grill for you." Really?? So I sent them back and ordered a nicoise salmon salad with the salmon cooked medium. It came out and looked amazing! I started eating the salmon and it was good on the outside, but raw by the time I got three bites into it. There were a couple of bones, which happens, and I understand that. However, when I ate a bite from the other side, there was an entire row of huge bones!! I told the server and she said the cool said there would be bones. I said well if you had told me that, I wouldn't have ordered the salmon, because you remove bones from salmon filets. Sent it back and didn't pay for it. Server was clueless.
