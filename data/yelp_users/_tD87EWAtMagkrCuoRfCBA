Buffalo Burgers are the best! Seems pricey but wow taste is incredible! Wedge fries done right..fluffy & crisp. I had the black bean side..spicy. Friendly staff, clean/ fun dine in experience. Perfect location off the highway. Spend a little more than your typical burger place & u won't be disappointed!

Picked due to good Yelp reviews & 2 $$. We missed Chevys that closed down:( Looking for more simple Mexican food..FRESH being so important. We were greeted quickly, plenty of open seats on a Saturday night. Wow amazing fresh salsa A+ chips plus bean dip. We ordered a Chimi & chicken corn tacos w/ a side of black beans. Yeah..new favorite Mexican place! Plenty of food for your $ that is made w/ love. Fresh & tasty makes me happy!

READ REVIEWS PLEASE! This Taco Bell drive thru plus customer service ( even the manager doesn't seem to care) IS THE WORST! Go to another. This is the 5th time my boyfriend has tried to order his meal & drives home (15) min to find out it's wrong!  They won't give u the $ back but not even IM Sorry or here is a free meal for next time so you come back?? Again they DONT CARE. It's Taco Bell go to another. We are calling the head manager to tell our story as well......most likely won't care either.

Went in Sat. night for early 5:30pm dinner. Wanted diner food. Seated in a nice comfy clean booth. Great server...dealing with all the tables & one server he did a great job:) nice dinner salad, id skip the soup, done right baked potato & shrimp basket for $8.99! Wow a lot of food. Hubby had club sandwich w/ ff..also done right. Large portions, fresh meal & better than Denny, IHOP etc. let's support small businesses:) 5 stars is overall a good deal for food, great service & clean surroundings. Give them a try.

Great New Look for $12! I went in for eyebrow threading since I can't wax due to having senstive skin. First time hurt some but the results are worth it! Anita knows how to shape your brows to make you look great. I'll be back in 4 weeks!

If it's Good TASTING Indian food you want for GREAT PRICES FOR PORTIONS then stop here! It may feel like your eating in grocery store but again once the food comes it doens't matter where you are. I've tryed over 8 different places accross the valley--this has very good mutter paneer for $5.99 w/rice and naan. They don't charge you for someone to clean up the table up since you throw out your own plate. Finally good Indian food that is affordable! Check it out. Samosa's are large---2 for $1.99!

Yeah.....Great New Place to eat Indian food! Clean & Friendly atmosphere:) We wanted fresh food & exactly what we tasted! You will wait 13 minutes for your homemade fresh samosa to arrive. From the way everything is served to you...to the taste in your mouth...you will want more!! We wanted to try everything! Every time we go back we will have to try something new...chef gets his lamb imported from New Zealand:) A+ Samosa, Garlic Naan, & don't leave without having the mango cake...light dessert that you won't want to share! Thank you Amanda & staff for a beautiful experience....we walked into a clean bistro & felt like we life an elegant 5 star restaurant! Worth every penny.!

Walked out feeling great again today:) Love the $55 a mth deal for 4 visits & they are open on Sundays. I have a bulged disk & need regular care. Misty asks me every visit how I feel & takes that into consideration during her adjustments. It's more than a 5 minute out the door adjustment done w/ the  same procedures w/ previous offices I've been too. I love her recommendations for after care & how I feel instantly after adjustments. I sleep better, feel better & know I'm spending so little on weekly adjustments to make me feel great! Highly recommended:)

Let's keep up the 5 star rating! Fresh & tasty sandwiches. Sandwich, soup or chips & large drink for $7.50/$8.00:) Wow...finally another fast food sandwich place with many different varieties..my favorite is the meatball sandwich! Love the grilled cheese too. Friendly service, you just know the food is made with love & they are happy to make it for you:) Id rather give my $ to small businesses & watch them grow. You will have a pleasant experience & be happy with amount of FRESH food you get for $. Enjoy!

Best deal in town & most care I've received within the last year of visiting chiropractors. She is my 4th doctor I've seen within the last year & spends the most time on her adjustments..not just a crack & your out the door. Misty is friendly & makes you feel comfortable. I have a bulged disk & she takes care of me every time. The office staff is super nice. $55 a month for 4 sessions best deal in town!!! She is my doc for life! Open M-Sunday! Misty is open on Sunday's 11-3pm....dedicated to her work!

They were very friendly when entering & waitress was super nice. Then the food came.....Salty Salty Wontons...then a bland meal..no flavor. I ordered cashew chicken & my sister had them make up a vegetarian meal without fish sauce. I order fried rice that came on the plate looking like brown rice...had horrible flavor. We both looked at each other after one bite & said "I can't eat this & after those salty wontons...let's tell them & leave to go somewhere else. The comped our whole meal plus drinks. So friendly staff for sure but I'm here for the food......Which I won't come back for Chinese sorry.
