What a joke. They would get a negative rating from me if that were possible. I stood in line for almost an hour waiting for someone - anyone!! - to just pull a cell phone for me to purchase (without plan upgrade) & the only person that talked to me was another customer??! Sales associates were walking around as if myself & several other customers were invisible. The prices aren't all that so I'm taking my business elsewhere...as apparently are the other customers that walked out also.

Seriously so much fun!! She's awesome & a very talented artist.  My henna still looked bright & beautiful after 2 weeks.
