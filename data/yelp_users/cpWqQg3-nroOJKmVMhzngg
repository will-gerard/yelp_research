I can easily give this place 5 stars. Service was wonderful, very friendly. Food was delicious, lunch portions were huge & reasonably priced. The cuisine is Latin so the flavors are a bit different than your typical Mexican/American resteraunt. The menu had an interesting and variety of delicious foods such as empanadas, Ancho dusted Wild Salmon croquettes and I had the smoked chicken poblano pepper which was amazing!  A bit difficult to find since there aren't any signs. It's tucked in between a dance studio & a hair salon. The patio is a big open courtyard shade by large trees and a nice ambiance from the bubbling fountain and music. They have live music ever weekend. Will be going back soon & want to check out their other locations.

This place is horrible!!! I gave this place a second chance because its close to home. Big mistake! Both times they hound u the whole time w upgrades going so far as to shake their heads & tell u how much u reeeeally "need" it. I told her 7 times I only wanted a basic pedi & was still told 3 more times I needed  my callus removed & 3 times how badly I needed a manicure. If they asked me one more time if I wanted f*#king flowers on my toes I was going to lose it! Also the massage was seriously less than 1 minute long!   All i wanted was to relax for a few minutes! If i wanted to be bigges to death i would have taken the kids w me. Will be going elsewhere from now on.

I am confounded that this place got any good reviews whatsoever! Wow. Maybe because it's the only restaurant anywhere in Buckeye and people don't have much to compare on.  We have 4 children (3 under the age of 6) and so don't go out to eat often due to price and hassle. We were attempting to get some nice photos taken at Verrado's nice parks around dinner time. Being as this is the only choice for food within 30 miles we ate here. BIG mistake, BIG.  The staff acted as if they were doing us a favor by serving us. Service was slow despite there only being a handful of people there.   My biggest peeve was that the Macaroni and Cheese we ordered for the kids was crappy boxed Mac n Cheese. Seriously?!!! That is unacceptable at a restaurant. I don't even make that crap at home, now I have to pay $4.00 for it times 2!! Also, the kids drinks (juice) weren't even included in the price so we paid $10 additional for 3 small canned juices.   My husband and older son ordered a pizza/calzone thing and said it was comparable to Peter Piper Pizza. Ick. The dough was ashen on the outside and undercooked on the inside.   I ordered Eggplant Parmigiana, my favorite. It was mediocre at best. Very, very small portion, no noodles, no salad, no nothing at all with it and it cost me $15.   Wait, it gets better.........  We paid $91 for this crappy meal. ALMOST $100.00!!! And, they felt it necessary to add a 20% gratuity to our bill since we had 6 people. Ummmmm, 3 of them were UNDER the age of 6 years old! My youngest is a baby and didn't even eat! I was so mad I was literally speechless.   Do Not Go Here.

My husband and I love coming here to play darts and listen to the Irish music. The drinks are reasonably priced and they have a great selection of draft beer. The patio is wonderful and roomy with a great fire pit, if only it wern't for all the smokers. The menu is mostly Irish fare (obviously) which involves a lot of meat & fat. However, they have decent wings, good home made soups and the lamb shank dinner is divine.  The service is hit or miss, usually pretty slow to refill our drinks but it's usually pretty busy there. Chrissy (waitress) is super friendly and very accommodating.

WAY overpriced, poor customer service. Advertised 25%-75% off all outerwear but after spending 1/2 hour in store & checking out, hats, winter gloves & outerwear snow pants not included only some coats. Gloves didn't fit the kids but the would only give me store credit even though I had receipt. Only shopping at Costco & Amazon from now on.

For a brand new, only been open for 2 weeks venue we were really impressed. I'm confident this place will easily be 5 stars and a favorite hang out of ours. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the food was all quite a bit over salted and they reeeeally need to work out a better parking situation. Again, minor kinks to be worked out.  We arrived around 2:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon before going to the Sun's game downtown. The very small parking lot was packed and "Valet Only" the surrounding streets were neighborhoods and cars were parked in front of houses for blocks. If I lived in one of those houses I would be pretty pissed every Friday and Saturday night.  We almost left because we thought the place would be over crowded but decided to give it a try. The inside of the restaurant was decent sized and had a very comfortable and inviting vibe. The patio was ginormous to quote Will Ferrel and lavishly decorated with plush green couches and large wing backed chairs. Large light bulbs were strewn across the covered patio along with pretty chic chandeliers making for a lovely lit canopy in the evenings. Casual? Yes, you can wear jeans here but don't mistake this place for a trendy, of the moment venue were the patrons are dressed in their very best wanna be Scottsdale attire.  Enough with the decor (Oh, but I didn't mention the bathroom shocker.......)   We were there in the early afternoon, it was busy but we were seated outside promptly.  I ordered 2 appetizers, the "Grilled Artichoke with Lemon Aioli Sauce" and the "12 Hour Slow Roasted Tomatoes".  My husband orderd the Fish and Chips with Cole Slaw.  The artichoke was grilled perfectly, charred in all the right places with a hint of smokiness and not to oily. The lemon aioli was divine. There was a bit too much salt which would have been fine if all the other food wasn't over salted as well. The tomatoes were Roma style and served whole and cold which I wasn't prepared for. They were a nice accompaniment to my artichoke but were all-in-all over glorified canned tomatoes. My husbands fish and chips had a smoked flavor which was wonderful and the fish was cooked perfectly and fell apart nicely and was moist and flavorful again, a bit over salted but still good, all the more reason to order another beer.  Our waitress was very friendly, helpful and prompt!

We were lucky enough to get free tickets here so we took our 3 young children. I was surprised at how big this museum was! Huge, open and beautifully decorated halls and several different large sections for every continent in the world. Each large area was divided into smaller sections displaying musical instruments, artwork and artifacts from countries all across the globe.   I was nervous that our kids were too young to enjoy this museum but they all had a fabulous time, even our 3 year old. We were all given head phones attached to a small pack which clipped onto our belt by a friendly girl behind the counter when we arrived. She explained to us that we needed to do nothing in order to work them and that they would automatically play the music when we stood by the different displays.   The kids loved this! The room with all of the many interesting musical instruments that you could pick up and play was a huge hit w the kiddos! I can't wait to go back w my husband for a date night especially since they have a large cafe/wine bar ;)

Upscale, trendy ambiance. Fast, friendly service. Our first visit, impression was fresh, quality seafood but a bit lacking on flavor and high priced. The two of us spent around $80 for lunch, I  had 2 glasses of wine my husband two beers. Second visit proved more successful. We ordered again off of the sushi menu. It was well presented, unique & we were pleasantly surprised by the arrangement of flavors.

We must have had excellent luck because I loved this place! I met my DH down town for dinner & movie (just doing our part to try & get dt Phx. hip & happening). He suggested Brick & I wasn't initially thrilled because I don't like most pizza but agreed to start there for a drink.  I was immediately intrigued however when we walked in the place by the rustic yet hip ambiance. The hostess wasn't very friendly but our waiter made up for it & suggested an excellent glass of wine which was priced so low for happy hour I had to have 2.  I ordered 2 small appetizers & a small Greek salad. I couldn't have been more pleased w all 3. Smoked salmon on corn 'cakes garnished  w a sliver of preserved lemon, dill & a bit of creme. The pesto stuffed artichokes w sun dried tomatoes were insanely good and my Greek salad was by far the best salad I've ever had. The dressing was a home made concoction of cider vinegar, fresh herbs and pomegranate. Who knew that would work on a Greek salad, mabey they should call it Medditteranean instead? Oh, the feta on the salad was very fresh and smooth. For 2 glasses of excellent wine, 2 premium beers, my smorgasbord & my husbands hamburger & fries we paid under $50 including tip!

I'm not a fan of you traditional American style pizza but the kids are. That being said, I don't expect much more than a lot of bread, cheese and bland, jarred sauce from most chain pizza joints. Barros delivered on that aspect, bleh. Our last visit however left me nauseous & annoyed.   As I waited in the car, my husband ran inside to pick up our pizzas to bring home. An employee, still w his dirty apron on walked out of the establishment coughing & gagging. A delivery kid passed him on the sidewalk in fro t of our car. During their quick exchange the gagging employee stated loud enough for me to hear through my closed windows that he "had just gotten through throwing up 5 times & felt like shit." Then he proceeded to cough, gag & spit right in front of my car.   Wow. Attempting to understand the facts that a. Everyone gets sick & b. We're talking about minimum wage workers here I went into confront the management and check on the state of the food we were bringing home to our children. The manager acknowledged the sick employee & assured us he had not prepared our pizza. I doubt he had not had any contact w food or food prep items in the closet spaced area.   I will not be ordering from Barros again. Or eating anything at all any time soon.

The only great thing about this place is the patio. The service is totally  hit or miss. The bartender was more interested in talking to his buddies than asking us if we wanted a drink, it took him over 5 minutes with no one else there to acknowledge us. The stuffed mushrooms were very bland and I had to send them back bcuz they were luke warm. They came back nuked and soggy.

Love the Curry Chicken Salad, Black Bean Burger hold the bun, extra Chipotle Hummus please (they're always so accommodating!) and the Pesto Turkey Lavosh wrap! Portions are very generous, always enough leftover for lunch the next day! Service is always extraordinary!

We ended up here because the Mr Good Cents near us had closed down. What a waste. The customer service was poor, they all acted like they were doing us a favor by serving us. My sister and I ordered a #12 which stated it came w sprouts & avocado. They only carry provolone cheese, no other variety. No real choice of bread either. When we sat down to eat we noticed there were no sprouts & a very small smudge of avocado on one part of the sandwich. When we asked about it the guy behind the counter looked annoyingly at us and said they no longer carried sports and that was how much avocado was supposed to be on the sandwich. No napkins, lids or straws came w our order or were any where to be found so I had to wait again to ask some one for them. The girl behind the counter, again rude, stated they were right there behind the counter (out of my vision) and told me to grab them myself.   The sandwich was bland and boring don't waste your money here, grab a sandwich from the grocery store.

We only came here for happy hour so haven't had anything but wings and beer but we are eager to go back! They make there own wing sauce as well as BBQ sauce, the wings were great! Friendly bar tender, Shannon or Jenna I think (sorry). They tout themselves as a whiskey bar with a very extensive selection of American, Canadian and of course Irish whiskey. Good happy hour and I hear their brunch is amazing with items such as South Western Eggs Benedict w a Jalapeno Hollandaise sauce. Nice, dark and clean country/Americana decor.
