Let's see where to begin, the menu states that all burgers are cooked to medium and had ordered it that way but it came out well over done! Also the chicken sandwich which is way over priced($9) for just two fried chicken strips on sandwich, come on you can get way better chicken sandwich at chick fil a for half that price! Plus to add on to it the chef/ kitchen staff doesnt know how to run a kitchen and an owner that doesnt know how to run a restaurant.... Over all will never return!!!

To start couldn't get seated because my whole party wasn't there even though there was an empty restaurant. Than three of the four people ordered beer and server said "Sorry to be a dick but can I check your guys ID" (Christopher was our server) Beers took forever to get to the table, overall horrible service! Food on the other hand was pretty good, love the fact that they use real mozzarella for there pizza.But our server rang in the wrong pizza than proceeded to blame it on the kitchen saying the kitchen is slammed and made the wrong pizza (again we where the only people in the restaurant) Stuffed Mushrooms where not the greatest thing, short on seasoning and bland. Would definitely not recommend this place...

Walking into Charr we had high hopes. They were flatten when we were greeted by the hostess who was seated behind the podium. Not only was the hostess seated,but we had to ask to be seated outside. The hostess never offered inside or outside seating.  Walking outside we noticed the many dirty tables, and the trash from previous customers littering the floor. In addition to the dirty tables, there was broken glass lying on top. The glass came from the lightbulbs above. So we moved inside.  Once inside  we were seated near a server station where you could hear the servers and hostess cursing. In addition to the foul language I witnessed a sever chasing the hostess around the restaurant with a dead bug!  I had ordered a beer on draft which was poured into a warm glass so with in minutes the beer was room temp and unpleasant. We both had burgers of course. I had ordered mine med rare and my girlfriend had ordered hers med well,both came out over and under cooked. For a burger bar I would think you would train your cooks to cook a burgers to order properly.  Truffle fries were nothing special have had better. And finally the bathrooms where so gross that most dive bars bathrooms where better then there's!! Overall would not recommend this place to anyone.

Where do I start...... After placing an order on Grub Hub at 7:30pm and getting a confirmation email that our meal would arrive an hour later, our food never arrived on time! Called Zella's and asked where our food was and the girl had no freaking clue. After finding our order and not offering any kind of discount at first and had to ask for one since this wasnt out fault they couldnt find our order(Which was half off). Pizza finally showed up 2hrs after offically placing the order and it was a complete disaster, pizza was messed up in the box and cold and everything else we ordered was cold, which doesnt make sense when we live less than 3 miles away and was told it would right out the door after it was made for our trouble. Pizza was ok, nothing to write home about and just really couldnt enjoy it. Food should have really been free and this place must be struggling because it seems like we flyers every week on our door step for this place and thought we would try it but wont be going back to this place anymore! Hope this place doesnt last because thats not how you run a business.
