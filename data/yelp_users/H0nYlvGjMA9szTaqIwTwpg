Wide selection and ok prices. I've been waiting for the last 2 hours to pick up my rental equipment. No obvious system to help service people.

They must not associate their name with pizza.

This place should be a case study of how a restaurant should be run. From the way they prepare to food to how they serve it, customer service, quality, amount, and prices of food, and atmosphere. Great.

Great service and fresh food. Take away the time you have to wait to be seated, and you have the perfect place.

The food is consistently good. Good selection of wines and pasta in their little market. Be prepare to wait about 20 minutes for your order, especially when its busy.

You know when you see someone and they look really good and you think they are cool and want to hang out with them and halfway through your first conversation with them you realize that they really don't have a character and they are really nothing but looks? This is exactly what RA is for sushi. Lots of fanfare and no essence.

A classic. Go on the early side if you want to enjoy dinner, stay late for the crowds. Get their oysters rockefeller.

Pleasantly surprised at pretty much everything: great food, wide selection of wines, and warm atmosphere.  I've had LGO's pizza, and this is better. Haven't had Bianco's yet but apparently they won an award for best alternative to pizzeria Bianco.  Will be back for sure, and if I like it again will give it 5 stars.

Brought my car in for an oil change because I had a coupon. Two weeks later I noticed oil stains in my garage where I park. I brought it back to my regular mechanic and he said that the Firestone mechanic that worked on it left the washer out when they put the oil tank plug back in and it was leaking.

I ate here often when I lived in the area. Cheap, good pizza.  Has anyone else noticed that they are not using a brick oven to cook their pizzas?

I have been to many Thai restaurants in the Valley and this is the one that I aways go back to. Their roasted duck is consistently good. Get the Ped gang daeng (801).

Needed brakes and general tune-up. Engine light was also on and dealer was not able to fix it. Just picked up the car 2 hours ago. Gene fixed everything, in a timely and professional manner. He did not overcharge and did not try to sell extra things. Gene is the man. Highly recommended.

Italian food, cooked and served by Italians with Italian ingredients. What else do you want? Best Italian restaurant in Arizona IMO.

This place is expensive and that's just it. BUT, they are also extremely professional and have the staff, resources and equipment to deal with pretty much anything your pet comes down with. Long time customer.  Most recent experience, I found a dog wondering around my neighborhood on a Sunday. He didn't have a collar so I called them up to see if they can scan him for a chip. Drove there, the staff scanned him, called the chip company, got the owners info, contacted the owner and reunited the dog with them within an hour.  4 stars because of price.

Make sure get there early or call for a reservation. It gets really busy pretty much every night, especially on the weekends.

I live in the area and Pier 54 is very popular with the Lakes residents. Nice little place right on the water with typical bar food. Dog and people friendly.

I go to the car wash to wash my car. I don't want to fix the crack on my windshield, or the dent on my bumper. When you say that you offer those services and I politely decline them, please stop keep trying to push them by offering better deals on the wash packages. It completely turns me off as a consumer and drives me to write bad reviews online.  Wash quality was not worth the $20 either. Really doesn't make a difference if you do the $10 wash.

I have been with the group for the last 5 years. The group is very friendly and the instructor very knowledgeable about Capoeira. Definitely the place to train in the valley.

Actually, 4 and half stars.  We organized a couple of fundraisers for our group. Groups receive 15% off. Went on Saturdays and Sundays. Avoid Saturdays because it gets really busy. Lots of kids running around. Staff try to supervise as much as they can but I think its an accident waiting to happen. You can have a birthday party for your kids and order food from there or bring your own. Works pretty well.   Kids will have a blast here.

We rented a car from them because our car was at the shop. Car was fixed earlier and needed to return the rental on a Sunday. They are closed on Sundays. Called their airport location to see if I can return it there. Person said yes of course, just make sure you include the pink receipt. Also, they may (will) charge you $35 for returning it to a different location.

So, apparently the reason they charge you $35 to if you return the car to a different location is because we had the 3-day special. The 3-day special has lots of restrictions.   We had to pay $6 per day for an extra driver, plus gas. So, the initial quote of $65, tax included for 3 days, for an economy vehicle was far from right. We ended up paying $106, taxes and gas included without returning it to a different location.  Get the 3-day special only if one person is driving, and you are returning it to the same location. Anything else and you end up paying double the quote.

Not worth the price but something to do with the kids when it's 1000 degrees outside. You get a discount if you buy your tickets online. It's also pretty small so take your time.
