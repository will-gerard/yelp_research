My wife and I and some good friends all went to Popos today. Chips and salsa were great. Salsa was some of the best we've ever had. Flavorful with just the right amount of heat. They had a special of 99 cent margaritas that were really good!  We started off with a cheese crisp which was excellent!! We all ordered different food and everything was really good. My wife's taco was great and my green chili burrito was outstanding.  Their Spanish rice is really good also!! Service was fast and attentive. Our waiter was really good too!  He had a great personality which made our experience even better. We drove over 30 minutes from Mesa to eat at this place and I would do it again in a heartbeat! Highly recommended!!

I had heard great things about this place so I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately , after getting our menus without so much as a hello, we waited over 10 minutes and finally walked out. I have not walked out of a place in years but we could only be ignored so long. As we walked out a female employee stepped aside so we could pass without her even blinking an eye or caring why we were walking out. Sadly I will never return to this place, What a disappointment. We walked down the block and had a great meal at another place!

Great food! Great service! Our waitress Molly was the best!  Fish and chips and chicken sandwich were both excellent. I highly recommend this place.  We will be back!!!

I needed a small thing repaired on my lawn mower and took it over to the great people at Pro Landscape and I was very glad that I did!! Not only did they fix my problem while I waited but they did not charge me an arm and a leg to do it! Great customer service!!  The next day I noticed I did not have my debit card and after a bit of research I realized I had left it at Pro Landscape the night before!! I called and spoke to Cory who told me that they had my card. What a relief that was!! I not only got great customer service at this shop but I also got to meet honest people who can certainly be trusted in any situation!!  This place will have my business for life!! Fast friendly and honest!!! Who could ask for more!! Thanks again Cory for holding my card!!!
