Wow what can I say?! These bagels are my favorite in Scottsdale. Whenever I get the chance, I stop here for breakfast. Fluffy on the inside, and toasted beautifully on the outside, these bagels are definitely made with love. They offer loads of toppings, and some of the best cream cheese I've ever had! Plus they have killer Yelp deals!!  They sure satisfy my major bagel craving!!!

Terrible. Go in for an oil change, leave with new tires and $1500 in repairs, under the assumption that everything would be fixed for my car. The next day my car starts making the worst noise I had ever heard. Went back in and it turns out my tires were not put correctly. How are you going to call yourself a mechanic if you cant even put a tire on correctly?

I came here after being turned away at pleasant nail across the street. I asked for a pedicure and was helped right away. Color selection is pretty decent, I found a color almost immediately. I sat down in one of the massive massage chairs which are nice and cozy. The lady that helped me (Bea) was delightful and has very gentle but strong hands which made for an amazing sea salt scrub massage. The only reason why it isn't 5 stars is they don't offer much with the pedicure. No hot stones, no paraffin, and sea salt was 5 dollars extra! There was nothing extra special about this pedicure, but I definitely enjoyed it! For a cheap pedi, I'll for sure be back

One star is honestly a stretch for this place. Since the first day I've moved in here there has been endless problems. 8 times and counting we have had maintenance come 'fix' our dishwasher and garbage disposal. It is STILL giving us trouble, causing our entire apartment to smell like rotten food. 2 weeks ago I called about ants attacking my bathroom. 2 weeks go by and JUST NOW there is someone knocking on my door to take care of the pest problem. On top of the slow and inefficient maintenance, the office staff is rude and incompetent. For the past month, I have had to climb the fence into my own apartment because the office staff won't put my name back on the gate call list, which was taken off without explanation.  They won't even give us a gate code for us or our guests to use to come in. I have asked 4 separate times to be put back on the list, to no avail. Even if I am lucky enough to to get into my own apartment complex, chances are I wouldn't find a parking space because they have 60% of the already TINY spaces taken up with construction vehicles. San Marin your only saving grace was how beautiful the complex was, and now you are ruining it with the ugliest paint scheme you could pick. If you are looking for a nice apartment in Scottsdale this is NOT the place for you.

By far the worst car service I've ever had. They have had my car for 2 weeks now. Every day it's "oh it will be done tomorrow" and tomorrow rolls around, they don't call us or anything. We end up having to call them every time and it's the same thing "oh well it'll actually be done tomorrow" and so on and so fourth. We will never be going back.

I would give this place a 5 but I am really frustrated. They charged me 2 dollars to get the polish off my toes. Who does that?

What can I say, I absolutely adore this place. My usual order is large green tea and a California club. Their club is by far the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. It had smoked turkey, eggs, bacon, cream cheese and more.  On top if the great food, their employees are amazing. They are always super friendly, incredibly patient, and have never steered me wrong.

My newest addiction! Nekter is my favorite place to stop for breakfast or lunch! Although I haven't found a juice that I love, I can honestly say their banana berry bowl is the best thing I've eaten. With bananas, strawberrys, blueberries, and granola,  their ginormous acai bowl has me full for hours. Not only does it taste good, when I take it to go, heads turn. One morning I was stopped 4 different times to ask what that delightful treat in my hand was! If you want to try something fresh, delicious, and healthy come to Nektar, you'll be happy you did!!

This has quickly become one of my favorite breakfast spots! A small restaurant in an unsuspecting shopping mall, Merci has made a great name for themselves. The staff always has a smile on their face, and genuinely seem like they have a passion for what they do. That passion is translated into a menu that is unique and delicious. My go to, the eggs royale, is one of the best eggs Benedict I've had. Only thing is they could add a little more of the sauce that comes on top. Also, the salad that comes on the plate is super yummy, but I wish it came on a separate plate. Too much going on in one space! But all in all I love this place, it is definitely worth a try.

I had the best brisket sandwich of my life!!! The melt in your mouth brisket comes with a great thin barbecue sauce. On top came their tangy slaw, and my goodness it provided an amazing crunch.  It came with their shoestring fries which are seasoned and cooked to perfection. I also had their white sangria which was the perfect amount of sweet, and complemented my meal perfectly! The atmosphere was open, happy, and inviting, I couldn't help but to feel at home. The service was also friendly and they had answers to all of my questions.  I will definitely be back, both here and their Scottsdale location!!
