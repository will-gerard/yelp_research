Recently went to a happy hour with some former co-workers at D&D.  I was the first to arrive and waited at the tables outside for my party to arrive.  After a couple were there, we went inside to get some beverages and went upstairs for a table.  The beverage selection was good, I was drinking beer, and while they didn't have anything on tap that I was interested in that night, there were several in their selection of bottles.  Some more of our group arrived, and a cheese tray was ordered, and it was decided that we were going to go sit outside, b/c they were starting up the heaters.  We got a table right under a heater, not too far from three dudes playing music.  I probably would have rather stayed inside, if only because of the music...I'm not against music per se, but I have trouble listening/focusing on conversation when music is being played.  Anywho, the funny part about this was that at one point, the band brought up some girl from the crowd who sang two songs with them.  For whatever reason, the conversation stopped on the patio.  Not sure if everybody knew her or what, but another guy and I just started talking...I mean, if we were talking during the band, why not talk during this girl's singing?  Hopefully we weren't too loud and didn't offend her.  Anywho, the cheese tray was good, but wish it had been labeled, because whoever brought out the tray did not do a good job at telling us what was what (I can't even remember if one of our group brought it out or an employee).  One other minor problem was that our heater went out (ran out of gas) but no one ever came over to restart it, and it got cold...    Overall four stars.  Pretty good happy hour specials and a nice setting.  Bet this would be a pretty great place to go in the evenings when it's a tad warmer.

I have to admit, I was a little nervous going to this place.  I've driven by the center literally hundreds of times over the years, and have never noticed the pizza shop.  It was only just recently that I noticed them, based on their sign on the street advertising the lunch special of two slices and a soda for $3.99.  Fast forward to a few weeks later when I was sitting at my desk pondering where to go, but being unable to decide.  My memory bank finally remembered Frank's and away I went.  I gotta admit, I was extremely nervous going in.  Here it was, right in prime lunch hour and there was nary a soul to be seen, other than the guy working there who was in the back (maybe it was Frank!).  Anywho, takes me order, and goes back to make the pie and I sat down and waited.  And waited a little bit more.  Then a guy came in and 'Frank' came out and chatted with him as they appeared to know each other.  Then a little more waiting happened.  I thought it was taking way too long as this point, seems at any other 'slice' joint I go to (Ray's/NYPD/etc.), it's just a few minutes.  Finally, 'Frank' brings my slices out and apologies to me that they were in the oven too long and would I like him to make new ones.  Well...I looked at that pizza, and all I saw was golden brown delicious cheese staring at me.  Which to me, is great when you have nice golden brown cheese.  So I told him no need, it looked great to me, and I started to chow down.  While the temperature was hot, and I kind of burned my mouth a bit (stupid lack of self control to wait for it to cool), the pizza was terrific.  I mentioned the cheese before, but the crust was also very good, being nice and crispy on the bottom.  And then, when I got to the thick part, not only was the crust nice and chewy, the bottom was still crispy.    Overall, a good couple slices of pie.  I'm likely to go back!

I first tried Spinato's about a year and a half ago.  I really liked it and wanted to go back, but for some reason, the wife didn't want to go back.  Yesterday, I finally convinced her to go back (with an assist from her sister, who is a fan).  We arrived right around 6:00pm and the wait was 30-35 minutes for a table  (Note:  This was odd as they have a patio with 5-10 tables, yet it didn't appear that they were seating anyone out there...not sure if it was because it was so windy?).  We decided to put in a order to-go instead.  Twenty five minutes later, our order was ready.  We ordered the Mamma's Signature pizza, which comes with baby spinach, diced tomatoes and garlic.  On the way back, I  was worried that the pizza wasn't going to be as good as I remembered and that I had built it up too much in my mind.  Nope, it was still delicious.  The nice sweet sauce and the crispy crust on the outside, it was great.  (The middle pieces seemed to get a little soggy, but I blame that on the drive home, rather than anything Spinato's did...).  Even the wife said it was better than she remembered, so it looks like there may be more Spinato's in my future!  The only downside was that we did not order any of their delicious garlic bread (one battle at a time!).    I give Spinato's four stars due to the deliciousness of the pizza and the fact that I'll likely make return visits.  I'm looking forward to having the leftovers too!

I met up with a couple of pals last week for lunch here.  The Park Central Deli has a lot of memories for me, as I've been going there over 20 years, first with my grandparents growing up, as a regular lunch when I worked in the area when I got my first job and occasionally visits now.  Of course, I don't know it as the PCD, it will always be Miracle Mile to me.  I mean, the food is the same, the menu appears to be the same, and I swear that the lady working my register is the same lady who used to be there during the Miracle Mile days.    I get the same thing about 90% of the time here.  Brisket on kaiser.  The quality can go up and down depending on the day (side note:  seems like the locations that kept the Miracle Mile name aren't as good on the brisket as this, one of the two original locations is), and this recent batch was pretty good.  (note 2:  I also make a mean non-bbq brisket, so I know of what I speak here).  The horseradish was nice and hot like usually, which gives a nice kick to the sandwich.  Only downside was that the fries seemed as if they weren't the freshest.  Overall a solid meal, just as I'd expect.  Due to the fries not being top quality, four stars on this visit, but whenever I have the chance, I try to stop in for the great grub and the nice memories.

This is another restaurant that is on my list of places that I was I had known about earlier in my life.  I've been going here for close to 15 years, and I can't recall ever having a bad meal there.  My most recent outing was for my birthday meal, the second year in a row Anzio's has won that honor.    My choice is usually a cheese or pepperoni pizza and hot wings.  (They have a great special w/ a large pizza and 30 wings that does the trick when you have more than two people).  This time we went with a cheese pizza, hot wings and also a side salad.   The wings were nice and crispy, had just the right amount of sauce to them, and temperature/temperature (actual/heat) were both great.  They also have a great mix of ranch they use for the dipping sauce.  The pizza was delicious, I'm not sure what the secret is, but if I didn't have a smidge of self-control, I could way over-eat here.  Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and I got another bonus of Anzio's lunch the next day, as there was leftover pie!    This was the first time in awhile I've been there for lunch, and they seemed to have a good amount of lunch specials (pastas, sammies, personal pizzas) on the menu, and the place was pretty crowded.  As usual, our server had a bit of sass to her, but that is part of the charm to this place, and it never takes away from quality service and quality grub.    Definitely one of my favorites, I also have been known to call in orders for pick-up and the food still is great after the car ride.  five enthusiastic stars!

I was back at Anzio's recently with a large party (10+).  There was no problem accommodating us.  Service was quick and very efficient, my iced tea never got below 50% full (or 50% empty for those of you).  The pepperoni pizza and hot wings were again delicious.

This place is definitely a classic. I only wish I had gone there more growing up in the area.  If I wanted to, I could catch up now though, because nothing has changed about this place!  Cheap, tasty grub.  Three video games at the front.  Bumper stickers and photos all over the place, and of course, the young high school (or recent graduate) girls working there.  I think the only difference from the ol' days is that they have some sort of ATM type system.  I tried something new this time, going with the BBQ Brisket sandwich with cheese.  While the cheese wasn't quite melted all the way, I definitely enjoyed the sandwich.  The beef was flavorful and the bread seemed quite fresh.  I washed it down with a classic, the Cap'n Cooler.    I also liked that the food was brought to the table, that was a nice touch.  If only they could make the parking lot a little more efficient...  Four stars for the good grub and solid value.

I met a friend here recently for lunch.  They had a good selection of lunch specials starting at $5.99.  Unfortunately, the entree that I ordered was not very hardy in the least.  I got Buffalo Sliders with curly fries.  The curly fries were good, but the sliders was sub-par.  Not only was there not much buffalo flavor, there really wasn't that much food.  I mean, I know sliders by nature are small, but it was almost as if I ordered mini-sliders!  I've been here many times over the years (including a memorable wing eating contest with a couple of friends where I ate 3 dozen...and wasn't in the top 3!) and the quality of food has really gone downhill as time has passed.    The service was ok, though I wasn't asked if I wanted my water to be refilled until we had been there for well over an hour.  I was also disappointed that they wouldn't accept my 'BOGOF' entertainment coupon because my entree wasn't from the regular menu.  The coupon certainly didn't qualify which entrees were eligible or not, and I wasn't feeling ornery enough to fight about the $6.    They probably deserve 2.5 stars rather than 2 stars, but I can't give halfs and since they have been on their downward trend for awhile, I figure I might as well give them the downward grade...

I'm torn on whether to give this place three or four stars...the food was definitely four star good, but the value was closer to three.  Also, the coffee, not so good...you know it is not one of their premier menu items when the couple next to you is greeted by the waitresses as regulars, order without looking at the menu, yet have brought their own coffee that they picked up at Einstein's on the way in...  Anywho, I had the breakfast sandwich, eggs, cheese and turkey sausage on a croissant.  It wasn't as big as I thought based on the description, but it was plenty filling, and probably kept me from gorged myself even more than I did.  On the side I got a fruit cup...what it is with places and fruit cups...there was plentiful pineapple and melon, and like two grapes.  Did I just get a bad scoop, did they have bad grapes that day, what is the deal?    Just thinking about the breakfast sandwich right now is getting me considering going back sooner rather than later (big ups to them for having a breakfast meat option that is not from a pig, btw)...so I'm giving them four stars.

I recently went to the Breakfast Club to meet a family member who was in town for a quick layover.  I didn't know too much about the place going in, other than it was on the wife's list of places to try.  I have to say I was definitely impressed.  We arrived sometime around 10am on a Sunday morning and were able to be seated within five minutes, which was nice.  I ordered the turkey/avocado/boursin omelet.  (This normally comes w/ mushroom but I got it without).  All I can say is wow!  This was a delicious omelet, I literally ate the whole thing (though I did slow down for a moment so my wife could taste a bite).  The service was good, though a little slow on bringing the check, though after that I did appreciate that they didn't pressure us to leave while we caught up, even though a line had formed.    Great food, this is more like a 4.5, rounded down to 4.

Love this place, only wish I could convince the wife to go more often.  My first experience with L & L was not in Phoenix, but in Hawaii.  Sister in law picked us up, took us out to L & L in Hawaii Kai and took the food and ate on the beach with the waves rolling in.  Of course, it was excellent food.  And of course, once I returned home and saw the L & L up at Happy Valley, I had to try to recreate that moment.  And normally, when you associate food with a very nice memory like that, the next time you have it, the food won't compare.  Well, guess what?  The food at the Happy Valley L & L tastes just as good as what I had on the island sitting on the beach.  That is a winner for me anytime.  Incidentally, I normally get the BBQ Mix plate (2 mac, 1 rice, no cabbage) which is the perfect amount of food to feed me for two meals...if I'm able to show enough restraint during the first meal to not reach the 'point of no return' (where you don't have enough food left for the second leftover meal...).    Five stars for the tasty grub, friendly service and clean store.  Also kudos for the cherry cola in the soda fountain.

The food is still good but the last couple times I've been there, the service has kind of lacked.  For an example, the most recent time I went there, the person working the register had a horrible time communicating with us and had no idea how to work the register.  I mean, I understand training for a new person, but when I make a change from the standard (going from 2 scoops of rice and 1 scoop of mac, to 2 mac/1 rice) that isn't that difficult, the employee shouldn't stand there looking at the register for a few minutes without asking someone for assistance.  Then the person I was with got the wrong thing based on the person's inability to communicate.  Luckily, he's not picky so it was fine...but still a minor annoyance. Anywho, like I mentioned above, the food is still good, so I'll still go there of course!

After being on our list for awhile, we finally made it out to Kashman's this week for breakfast (on a week day).  I was a little surprised when we got there, as I expected a sitdown restaurant, but instead it's an order at the counter and the food is brought out kind of place.  There was a TON of seating outside, and I remarked to my wife that Kashman's is probably the place to go on the weekend's once the temps cool down...  We each ordered a coffee and the wife ordered a egg/cheddar bagelwich on an everything bagel, while I ordered the stuffed challah french toast.  There were several choices of Seattle's Best coffee at the self serve condiment bar, and I think three different types of milk.  Coffee was good.  After a few minutes the food was served to us.  My french toast (stuffed w/ cream cheese and fried) was delicious.  It was one of the dishes where I have to tell my wife that if she wants a bite she better hurry up and get it while there is some to be had.  I finished the whole thing, no problem and wish the serving size had been a touch bigger.  The only downside of the plate was the fruit that came with it.  There was much honeydew and cantaloupe (both of which I dislike) and precious few slices of delicious strawberry.  I also had some of my wife's sandwich after she was done, and thought it was good, bagel was nice and warm still.    Kashman's get a solid four stars, and I'd probably go more often if it was a little more convenient for me, though I have a couple of relatives who I would consider making the drive out here for.

First off, I have to say that the food was pretty good, and if I judged solely on that, Greektown would likely get four stars from me.  Unfortunately, the service (lack thereof?) was not so good.  I rank this place 2.5 stars, but since 3-4 days later we are still talking about the poor service, I rounded down to two instead of up.  We were for a birthday dinner this past weekend, a total of five adults and one infant .  We arrived around 5:30 or so, thinking this would be plenty of time to have the meal, and leave in plenty of time for the child to be home before 'cranky time'.  The first problem was when we had to wait for 5-10 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was half full.  If a second person hadn't come up to us, I'm not sure how long it would have taken.  The second problem was that the service was just slow.  Maybe this is normal here, but I've been to other Greek restaurants and the meal has never been this slowly paced.  Another person in our party thought they were understaffed, but I didn't get that impression.  Anyways, after an hour and fifteen minutes, we had only received the apps and just gotten our soups (note:  The hot/fresh pita bread was fantastic!)though one person did not receive a bowl for some reason.  At this point, our youngest dining companion let it be known that it was time to go.  I drew the short straw and headed home.  I was later informed that the service continued to be slow the rest of the time and the meal was not finished for another 45-60 minutes after I left.  I also heard that it took around 10 minutes for the check to be brought out after being requested.  When my meal arrived home, it tasted very good, even though I had to heat it up in the microwave.  Bottom line, I would give Greektown another chance based on the food alone.  However, if you have some time constraint or are with an infant (it was pretty loud in there), you might want to go someplace else.  2.5 stars, rounded down.

The wife and I went here on a recent weekend after having it on our radar for quite awhile.  I expected it to be crowded when we got there around 8am on Sunday, but there was hardly anyone there, although as we were wrapping it up, business had picked up a little bit.    Service was fine, nothing bad, nothing great.  We both started off with coffee, which was average.  The wife ordered a mini-stack of pancakes, which was huge, she had about half of them leftover for the next morning.  I ordered an omelet (avocado/mushroom/cheese minus the mushroom).  First of all, not only was this omelet pretty big, it seemed like they substituted the subtracted mushrooms with additional avocado, which was very nice.  There was a ton of avocado on top, plus in every bite of egg as well.  The hash browns that came along with it were very good as well, nice and crispy.    I saved the second half of the hashed browns and the biscuit for breakfast the next morning.  Both were as good the next day as they were the first day after putting them in the toaster oven.  Overall, I enjoyed Black Bear very much and hope to go  back soon.

We have been to Bajio dozens of times since it opened a few years back.  I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed in a meal.  There have been a lot of changes over the past couple of years, with the recent change to being a 'cantina' with flat screen tv's, alcoholic drinks, etc.  The ordering is very simple, it's an assembly line (a la Chipotle).  If you want (or don't want) something, all you have to do is tell them.  The three of us went for a weekend lunch, and the place had a pretty good crowd.  The line still moved pretty fast.  I got a chicken quesadilla with rice and beans, rather than my regular nachos.  The quesadilla was good, though I'll probably get the nachos next time.  The rice and beans were also good.  The one problem with the meal (and all of us thought this) was that the sodas seemed to be on the flat side.  At first I thought it was a problem with my drink, but when I mentioned it later, everyone else had the same problem.    This visit, Bajio earned a solid 4 stars, marking them down for the odd tasting drinks.  On an overall/portfolio, I'd give them 4.5 stars.  (Note:  I did have an issue with them a couple weeks back when somehow I got subscribed to their text club.  I mean, five texts in 10 minutes is a little ridiculous, even if I had knowingly signed up.  Luckily, I talked to a manager, Jan, who was extremely helpful and took care of the problem).  I will definitely be back to Bajio.

The downward spiral is complete...the wife was going to eat Bajio tonight while I was going to pick up L&L.  Our plans were foiled as Bajio is CLOSED (letter on the door indicating non-payment).

I've been to this location twice and both times, not only did I receive stellar service but my coffee drinks were delicious as well.  The first time we went was to pick up some gift cards and we decided to get a drink.  I believe we were being served by the manager, who was quite knowledgeable and very friendly.  I also liked that while you wait for your drink (or just hang out) that they have a variety of board games that you can play.    My second visit was just as good.  The employee who took my order was super-helpful, explaining what the new drink that they were sampling was.  My drink came without whip, though I think I ordered it with...though I'm not sure.  Either way, that's probably how I should get it, just to save some calories!    I definitely will be back.  4.5 stars, rounded to 4.

The wife and I have been to this location literally dozens of times since they've opened.  We've eaten in, we've taken out.  This time, since an errand called us away during dinner prep time, we called the order in on the way back.  Got there about 10-15 minutes after we called the order in, and it was ready to go for us right when we arrived.  There was a slight snafu in paying...I have a PF Chang 'Emperor's Card' which gives the holder 10% off at PF Chang...we had also been told that it was good at Pei Wei.  Apparently it is not accepted there.  Which isn't that much of a problem...expect that it took 5-10 minutes for them to figure it out.  The person helping me called another store (or someone) to verify and before she did I told her that it wasn't a big deal, I didn't want to have to wait 5-10 minutes just for $1-$2.  She assured me it would be quick...but to me it wasn't.  Not a huge deal, but definitely not optimal.  Got home with the food, lettuce wraps and honey seared chicken with brown rice is a perfect sized meal for the two of us, and usually we have some leftovers.  Everything was good, as per usual, though they never pack enough lettuce cups, that is kind of annoying.    Solid four stars for Pei Wei, the food is always delicious, the service is always good (even with the wait this time, it was still good service and friendly).  Definitely will be back.

This was my first trip to Freddy's in probably close to a year...not because I don't like it, but my wife is a bigger fan of Culver's.  I had a meeting that evening that caused me to miss at home dinner time and decided to hit up Freddy's for my dinner.  This was my first time through the drive-thru, all other visits had been inside.  Drive-thru, even though there was a steady stream of cars, was fairly quick.    I ordered a double California Burger, with fries and a soda.  Now, I'll be honest, this was a few weeks back, and the fries and soda weren't that memorable...but the burger was fantastic.  Seemed meatier than normal (maybe that is in comparison to the usual Culver's burger?) and the taste was great.  Cooked as good as a fast-food burger can be cooked.    Oh Freddy's, I like you so, hopefully I can ditch my wife more often to dine on your delicious burgers!

Recently met a friend here for a late lunch on a weekday.  When I rolled up I was bummed that the happy hour beer specials didn't start until 2PM (two for one).  I was pleased when we got the receipt that since our server didn't ring us up until 2:15, we got the special!  The server was also good at being non-intrusive while we were catching up prior to looking at the menu.  As for the food, it was fine.  They had some nice lunch specials categories from 'single' through 'home run', which were basically an entree plus a salad and soda.  I went with a 'double', which was a one topping personal pizza, caesar salad and bottomless soda for $7.99.  Not a bad deal at all.  The pizza was good (and there was enough for leftovers), while the salad was just ok.    I would definitely go back to Oggi's, especially for a happy hour.  I solidly rate them at a 3.5 and am going to round either up or down...think I'll go up, mainly because the service was solid.  (Plus, if you like sports, there are a ton of TV's in the place).

Recently visited Greenberg's on the recommendation of one of our friends.  We were not disappointed.  Each of the four of us were very pleased with our meals, and we seriously considered coming back for additional meals later in the trip.    I got a sandwich that had brisket, turkey, pastrami topped with muenster cheese on rye that was very good.  Another person in our group got the same thing and agreed.  I think the sandwich was around $9, which was a good value.  An added bonus was that we sat outside the restaurant and were able to watch the NCAA games that were going on from the tv's at whatever bar is across the way.

After hearing a lot about all of the MBFGR's that are around the valley, I finally got a chance to go recently as part of a family gathering (which was a planning fiasco and logistical nightmare, but I digress).  This location was, well, let's just say, it wasn't crowded.  And it showed in the service, very nice and attentive.  They were very patient when our party was supposed to be 8 people, then ballooned to 12 people, then 13.  Unfortunately, one of the solutions to accommodate us was to put a couple of square tables 'attached' to our eight person round table.  I *hate* this.  It's just awkward for at least half the people, and then the people that get stuck at the 'junction'...sucks...  We ordered some apps, though the only one I tried was the saganaki.  It was definitely good and the pita bread that it came with was nice and warm.  For a meal, I ordered a gyro pita.  Now, I understand that this is a 'full' greek restaurant, and maybe I shouldn't have gone with a gyro, BUT, that's what I was in the mood for, and being a basic greek food, shouldn't be hard to make a good one right?  Well, apparently not.  I've probably gotten gyros at ten places around town, and this was definitely the worst one I've had.  The pita wasn't particularly warm and the meat was kind of tough.  The tzatziki was fine, but thought it was a little weird to be on the side.  The service was good and patient, but the lame decision to combine two different kind of tables (when we suggested moving and pushing several squares together) knocks them down a little bit.  Though not as much as the not good gyro.  Probably closed to a 2.5, but rounded down to 2.

This is my go-to place for gyros in my neck of the woods.  I have been here dozens of times since they opened approximately five years ago and can't remember being disappointed any of the times.   I also love that fact that pretty much every time I go in there, something about the place is different, whether it is a new menu board, new tile, the coffee bar is gone, etc,.  I ordered my usual, the gyro meal.  As always, the gyro was stuffed full of meat and had great flavor.  Really good pita and tzatziki sauce too.  The fries...well, the one inconsistency about Chicago Gyros is that the fries sometimes are overcooked or not super-hot (could also be a side-effect of me taking the meal home most times).  That being said, they are pretty much always crispy and taste great, and once again I was not disappointed.  If I was ranking just on this visit alone, I'd probably give it 4.5 stars and round down, but since I have a solid history and bump up to 5 stars, because I know that I'll be back, and I know that it will be good.

I've been to Over Easy three times now, twice pre-DDD (and Yelp membership) and one post.  We had a family member in town and we met up for breakfast one Sunday morning with a medium sized group.  We weren't the first to arrive, and the first people arriving already had staked out a table for us, so no wait for us.    The first thing that I noticed was that the menu seemed a lot heartier than my first two visits (including something on the menu that appeared as if it was trying to be a challenge for Man V. Food).  While it doesn't bother me particularly that they expanded the menu, I didn't really see why they needed to change from the simple menu they had.  And no JPO coffee???  (Ok, so the coffee was probably still the same, but I still liked the whole 'JPO' part).    Anyways, I had the basic brioche french toast with a side of tater tots (big plus for having tots).  It was good, not spectacular.  The tots were ample, so I appreciated that.  Service was good.  It did seem to get a bit warm, but we were in the 'outdoor' section, so that was to be expected.    Probably closer to 3.5 stars, but this was my 3rd time there, and I would go back, so I'm rounding up to 4 stars...I think it was the tots that put them over the top.

I usually don't write reviews for huge chains like this, but sometimes you just gotta vent.  Hit the drive-thru on Black Friday with the wife.  I ordered a Venti (large) caramel brulee latte, while she got a Tall (small) Pep Mocha latte.  The total was approximately $8.  I roll up to the window, and hand the cashier a $5 plus a coupon for one free drink.  I'd assume that she'd take off the most expensive one, or at least ask, but no, she didn't ask.  So I was expecting about $1 plus change, and was surprised when the cashier gave me $.18.  I questioned which drink she took off, wondering why the venti wasn't the free drink.  Her rational to me was that 'it wasn't that big of a difference because both drinks are about $4'.  I questioned her, specifically asking her if venti and tall drinks really cost the same.  She insisted that yes they did.  Of course, she proceeded to hand me the receipt, I saw that was false (which I already knew).  Yes, it was only a dollar, but this was a complete and utter customer service failure.  If I had not said anything, I could understand, but I questioned which drink she took off and she either lied to me, or was too incompetent to know the price difference.  Additionally, annoying is that I promptly sent an email to Starbucks customer service and a full week later, I have not received a response.  Zero stars to this location and zero stars for no email response from Starbucks corporate.  UPDATE:  I'm upgrading this location to a half of a star.  Starbucks corporate finally contacted me about my letter about 10 days or so after I sent it.  While the email they sent me was apologetic, they did not answer any of my questions about Starbucks policy.  Lame.

The wife and I decided to hit up Bourbon Steak for Restaurant Week 2009.  We couldn't get in last year because we waited a little bit too long on the reservations so we were definitely anticipating our visit.  The first word of advice, if you don't plan on utilizing valet parking at the front of the resort, please be prepared to be confused where to park.  We saw at least three lots that were virtually empty but we weren't able to park there without a special code or room key.    We arrived right on time for our 6:30p.m. reservation and were seating right away outside on the balcony.  It was nice out, a little humid, thought they might ask us if we'd like inside or outside...  One note about the seating outside...the tables are VERY close together, not only could I hear everything the couple next to us was talking about, anytime the server was helping them, his butt was a little too near our table.    We were greeting by our waiter quickly, and he took our beverage orders, and explained how restaurant week worked.  Shortly after he left to give us some time, another employee came up with some duck fat fries, compliments of the house.  There were three different flavors with three different sauces.  The herb fries and truffle fries were enjoyed, the paprika ones, not as much.  Shortly after this, we were brought out a nice tasting focaccia bread.  Our waiter came back and we ordered our apps, entrees and dessert from the restaurant week menu, and also added an order of truffled mac n cheese from the regular menu.  I had the beef carpaccio, which was pretty tasty. One thing I did not like about it was that there was some random things on it, but I couldn't tell what it was, because by this time it was dusk and I couldn't see my plate real well.  The wife had the greens, which she liked.  For entrees, we both ordered the kobe flat iron & short ribs.  Both were flavorful, but I have to say the flat iron was better than the short ribs, only because the fatty flavor of the short ribs became a little overpowering after eating the whole thing.  The accompanying carrots and pasta were also quite tasty and I virtually cleaned my plate.  Next, out came the desserts, wife with the marscapone cheesecake and myself with the beignets w/ butterscotch sauce (or pot de creme for the foodies).   I had heard pretty good things about the beignets...I have to say I was just whelmed w/ them, they were fine.  Okay flavor.  I didn't particularly care for the sauce, I'd have preferred a little more butterscotch, this seemed more scotchy to me (but if you really like scotch, I bet you'll like the sauce).  The wife loved the cheesecake.  I was seriously surprised that she let me try some the way she was raving about it.  It was pretty good, I have to say.  You may be wondering though, 'how was the truffled mac n cheese'?  I'm still wondering the same thing!  They never brought it out.  It's no wonder, as it didn't make it to the receipt, so our waiter must have just spaced on it.  Probably for the best because we were stuffed after this delicious meal and I don't know where we would have put some mac n cheese.  I rate Bourbon Steak four stars.  The food was for the most part great.  The service was very attentive, with one blunder of a missed order.  The atmosphere was also very nice with the exception of the close quarters and poor lighting.  I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.

I had Stacy's for the first time this week.  Due to an appointment down there, the wife picked up some takeout, as we've been talking about trying it for awhile.  As such, I can't comment on the charms of the building, though I know it well, formerly working right across the street (unfortunately, before it was Stacy's).  Anywho, we ordered the beef ribs, beef brisket and some mac n' cheese.  As a treat, the wife was a doll and got me some grape kool-aid as well.  First, the beef ribs, I opened up the container and the meat was already falling off the bone, that's how tender the meat was.  The sauce was delicious and I would not hesitate to order these again.  I only had a sampling of brisket and also enjoyed this as well, good flavor and nice and tender.  The mac n cheese was fantastic though, perfectly cooked macaroni...plus it was like cheese explosion in my mouth, which is never a bad thing.  The kool aid was a little bit watered down, but I blame that more on the drive home then on the establishment.  The only negative was that I wasn't brought any of the red velvet cake that looks so good on their website, however the wife said that one she saw when she was there did not look good.  Gives me a reason to go back though, right?  I give Stacy's four stars, but if able, I'd probably give it 4.5.  I would not be surprised to see the ranking go up to 5 stars on the next visit if the red velvet cake is good.

I went to Sauce for the second time on a recent Friday night.  This was my first time at the Norterra location and the first time in several years since I've been there.    The ordering process is similar to Pei Wei, menu boards on the wall as you are in line, with a couple of registers at the front.  The line was short, so we were ordering in no time after we decided.  We chose to share a mozzarella/fontina/basil pizza and chicken/pine nuts/tomato/ gorgozola salad.  The restaurant was crowded, but fortunately we spotted someone leaving as we were searching for a seat, so we didn't have to look outside.  We sat down, and I went to get our drinks.  This is one area where the design of the restaurant is a bit of a cluster, walking to and from the beverage station over our entire visit, I almost ran into (or was almost run into) by employees coming out of the kitchen area.  Luckily, no incidents occurred, so it wasn't a big deal.  The salad came out pretty quickly and was good.  The chicken was especially tasty, though I didn't have too much, as I was saving room for the pizza, which came out a reasonable amount of time later.  I enjoyed the pizza very much, the flavor was quite good.  I liked it so much that I had five of the eight slices!  My only minor quibble would be that the middle of the pizza didn't have the same crisp as most of the rest of the pizza.  Overall though, very good.  We enjoyed Sauce.  The food was good and was a nice value (we had a free salad with pizza purchase coupon).  Solid four stars, I'll be back.

Went to Culver's last night with the family.  We are definitely not strangers to this place, having been dozens of times since they opened a year ago.    We were dining in, so the wife went up to place the order, while I found a booth for us to sit in.  The only problem was that the seats and table were both a little dirty.  Luckily, a napkin cured that up right quick, and we were good to go.  The wife came back after ordering and I went right over to get the same fountain drink I always get there, the Culver's Root Beer.  I'm not usually that big of a root beer fan, but their's is delicious.  Every time I get it, I'm mystified that a soft drink out of a fountain can be so creamy.  The food came 5-10 minutes later.  The wife had one of their new grilled chicken sandwiches w/ onion rings which we shared (I'd rather get the mashed potatoes, also delicious, but marriage is about compromise, right?), while I had a Classic Double Cheese Butterburger.  As per usual, the double burger was very good.  Possibly even good enough to challenge Steak N Shake (which for some reason still isn't in AZ!).  The onion rings were also good, nice and crispy.  We did not get custard this time because we were full from dinner and the flavor of the day didn't particularly tickle our fancy.  Culver's gets four stars for the good grub and good selection.  I will be back.

I've been back to Culver's several times since the initial review for custard only, but went this week to celebrate a family milestone and got dinner and dessert.  I ordered my usual double burger with cheese, mashed potatoes and creamy root beer.  All were top notch, as expected.    For dessert, I normally go with the custard of the day, or make a sundae (vanilla custard, peanut butter and either reese's pieces or cups is the bomb bay).  This time, I decided to go with a vanilla malt.  And not just any malt, but one with extra malt flavoring (note:  I was mildly annoyed that the girl at the register didn't indicate that their was an upcharge for additional malt).  This was a super thick, delicious, malty malt.  Usually a dessert from Culver's gets put in the freezer for seconds later, but this malt barely made it home it was so good.    Five stars for the continued excellence on the food and the great malt.

They changed the formula on their mashed potatoes.  It took them from 'always delicious' to 'so gross I didn't even eat 1/4 of them'.  I emailed Culver's and the response was that they changed them so they could be aligned with the rest of the chain and match up with the nutritional guide.  So really, two strikes, 1/ sucky mashed potatoes now and 2/ apparently I was relying on an inaccurate nutritional guide for several years and dozens of visits...

We went here for a date night a few weeks back.  One of the reasons we ended up here was because I stumbled across a promotion where everyone in America got a free order of chicken lettuce wraps.  That's all you had to say to get me there...thank you Briny Baird!  It was a Friday night and arrived around 5:30p.  Pleasantly surprised that there was no wait and we got seated right away.  Our waitress did not come around for awhile.  It turned out that she was the same waitress that was at the table next to us just chatting away for a bit.  Luckily, she was just as friendly with us and we were treated just as well.    Our order was for the lettuce wraps and the sesame chicken, which we had never had before.  As per usual, the lettuce wraps were quite delicious and we cleaned the plate.  The sesame chicken came shortly after we finished, and I really like it.  Good flavor, nice tasting chicken, no complaints at all.  A big bonus was that it was not deep fried, but pan fried chicken.  My iced tea never reached bottom as well, so they did a good job with that too.  Four stars for the good service and good grub.  I'm sure I'll be back to Changs (or Pei Wei).  (Sure it's a chain, but it's a homegrown one, so how could you turn your back on them?).

Now two stars...  Went this past weekend for lunch and enjoyed the patio.  Nice to be outside, but they need more tables that accommodate more than 2 people.  Also, the queueing system is still a nightmare.  Still confusing.  Plus our food took a long time to come out...  Another thing I didn't like was that when I was getting silverware, I looked at the spoons and there was one with a big chunk of lettuce/spinach on it.  Gross.  If the food wasn't good and they didn't keep sending me two-for-one coupons, I wouldn't go here...

Just to be clear, this is a 3.5 star review and I'm rounding up to 4 stars (see below).   I finally had the opportunity to try Pizza A Metro last week when I met up with a friend who lives in the area.  He advised that we should get takeout since sometime the restaurant can get crowded with the limited seating and a little inconvenient with people waiting for pie with their butts right next to your table.  We called in our order for a Margherita and were told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  We stopped at the supermarket on the way for some wine and headed straight to pick up the pie, which was waiting for us on the counter when we got there.  Headed quickly back to my friend's for the grub.  All I can say...I definitely see the promise in Pizza A Metro.  I think something got lost, maybe the pizza was sitting on the counter for a bit, maybe the drive took too long to get home, but when I ate, the pizza wasn't piping hot and the crust didn't have a nice crispness to it like I would have liked.  Very good flavors and the crust still was good.  I could definitely see liking this pizza more than Cibo (which I like better than Bianco).  The two leftover slices were quite nice as I used the toaster oven to get a nice crisp on the crust.  Usually for a place I'm going to for the first time, i'd round down to three stars.  However, the friend I was there with has been many times and loves it and he is pretty spot on grub...so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.

Finally got to Sweet Republic after wanted to try it for awhile.  We arrived around 1pm or so and were the only ones in the shop (though two other parties came in shortly thereafter).  The employee behind the counter was very helpful, offering up as many samples as we wanted (I was good and only had two!).    The wife and I decided to split a 3-scoop cup, with Salted Butter Caramel, Almond Buttercrunch and Sugar & Spice (at least I *think* it was Sugar & Spice, I tried to grab a to-go menu while we were there but they didn't have any printed up at the time).  They were all good, I probably liked the Almond Buttercrunch the best (huge candied pecans mixed in!).  I also sampled the Malted Vanilla flavor, and wow...anyone ordering this as a shake is in for a real treat...  I'd be more likely to make it back here if it was a little closer, but probably won't make a special trip just to go here.  I'm sure I'll go again when I'm in the neighborhood though.

We met a friend here on a recent Saturday for lunch.  I was surprised how busy it was, since last time I was there, it wasn't quite a ghost town, but close.  Anywho, we had to wait about 10 minutes or so for our table to be prepared (party of 7), but it wasn't a big deal since we were a little bit early.    We got seated and after chatting for a bit, placed our orders.  I don't remember what everyone else got, but I got a gyro.  I do remember that my wife's food did not get brought out in a timely manner.  Either they forgot to make it, or mistakenly gave it to another table.  As a result, my gyro was less than hot, because we all waited until she had her food.  Another weird thing...I figured the gyro would come with a salad or rice or something on the side...it was just straight gyro.  But, it was still quite delicious.  And other than that snafu, the service was good.    I would return to Pita Jungle.  Thought about three stars b/c of the food delay, but both times I've been the food has been quite good, and my food this time still had good flavor.  More like 3.75 rounded up to 4.

We went to Next about a week or so ago.  I got coffee and the wife got some sort of fancy foamy drink, which I can't remember right now.  I did think that there prices for lattes/frappes/etc. were a little bit higher than the nationals.  Anywho, I got my coffee cup and went over to the side to choose from the two coffees that were up there.  I must have gone during a switch because when I topped off on the way out the door, there were now four coffees available.    The coffee was quite good and I liked the atmosphere.  I could definitely see going back here and having a coffee drink and hanging out, maybe even on the patio outside.  I rated Next 3.5 stars and was debating between rounding up or rounding down.  I decided to go up based solely on the employees.  Not only were they friendly the day of service, each of the next week we were recognized when we went to the farmer's market that is in the center and Next had a table set up.  Definitely impressed with that.

We ran into the Tamale Store purveyors at the Citadelle Market a few weeks back.  In the fall/halloween spirit, we decided to get two of their pumpkin tamales (frozen).  The next night for a nice dessert, we prepared them in the steamer.  I don't know what I was expected, but, wow, they sure were good.  Went back the next week, and decided to get something a little more savory (in addition to a couple more pumpkin ones).  We settled on two ground beef/cheese and two green chili chicken.  Again, we prepared them in the steamer from frozen.  And again, they were quite good, I cleaned my plate and part of my wife's as well.  Definitely will be getting more tamales from there, they are so good.  The only thing keeping them from a five star review is that in the two pack of ground beef tamales, there was one ground beef and one shredded meat (probably beef, but quite possibly pork).  Hopefully it was just a one time mistake, a lot of people (like me!) don't eat pork for one reason or another...

I went here recently with a medium sized group for a bachelor party dinner.  We arrived right at 6 pm for our reservations and were seated immediately.  We were given the rundown on how everything works, and then were unleashed.    My first stop was the salad.  I came in with a plan, go easy on the salad part to leave room for the good stuff (meat) and get some salad fixin's to at least make it seem like it is a somewhat balanced meal.  Overall, I have to say I was pretty disappointed with the salad bar.  The only things that I were really impressed with was the fresh cheeses (fresh mozzarella balls especially).  I guess the pesto salad dressing was nice but most of it was just average for me.    Finished the salad plate, and flipped the red/green card to go.  (Note:  I'm not sure how efficient this system was, there were times when I was green and the gaucho's passed me by, and times where I was red when they asked how I liked my cut).   All of the sudden it was a whirlwind of skewer toting gaucho's, asking if you'd like some of their meat (hmm...that sounds more like a description for a bachelorette party?).  I tried countless different cuts of meats, top sirloin, filet, chicken leg, lamb, etc.  My least favorites were the lamb (did not like the flavor, I usually really like lamb) and garlic meat (can't remember the cut offhand) which was a little overpowering with the garlic (and I like garlic).  The best were the filet mignon and the rib eye.  The other meats I had were also very good.  We were also served some cheesy bread rolls and a trio of sides, garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and fried plaintains.  I did not try the plantains, but the garlic mashed were uninspired at best (and opposite of the meat had little to no garlic flavor) but the polenta was fantastic.  I had at least three of those suckers.    Service was mostly good.  One problem with the meat service is that you get hit with 5-7 different meats in rapid succession, then you don't see another server for a bit.  Kind of feast of famine...  Also, we had one person order an after dinner coffee that wasn't deliver and an error on the check.  I additionally thought that the layout of the restaurant wasn't great, when it was crowded when we left it was pretty hard making it through all the tables when they were full and you had tons of employees running around.  I liked it.  I would definitely go back to a brazilian style steakhouse again, though if I went to Fogo, I might go for lunch (starting Oct 1) and save about $20 bucks.

We had been trying to get to Grady's for months and for some reason or another in never worked out...until this weekend.  We headed up there for some takeout on Friday night with a hankering for the BBQ.    After finding the strip mall that it is in (note to those unfamiliar with the location, it's in the same strip mall as Pappy's, which has more conspicuous signage), we went inside, which was empty.  I counted a total of six chairs at two tables (not including the two chairs in the waiting area) so if you are planning to eat there, hopefully it is during a lull.    Grady greeting us promptly and gave us a tour of the menu.  We put our meat orders in, and Grady when to the back to get it going.  While he did this, his wife (I assume) helped us as we chose our sides.  The brisket dinner I ordered came with one hot side and one cold side, but I wondered if I could get double hot (mac n' cheese) instead.  She told me no, which was kind of disappointing because the menu said something about accepting all reasonable requests.  I was later super surprised and happy when my brisket came out with double mac AND the cold side, potato salad, I had ordered.  Now that's some nice service!    On to the food, it smelled and looked great.  I had the brisket (mild sauce), *double* mac n cheese and potato salad.  The wife had a pork sandwich and cole slaw.  She liked her food and commented that she would eat there again.  My food was good, the first couple bites of brisket seemed a little chewy, but after that all was good.  I liked the flavor of the potato salad as well, though my wife thought that it was store-made.  The leftovers were also good the day after as well.  The ranking above says 4 stars, but it is really 4.5 stars.  The service was super friendly and food was very good.  I will definitely be back.

This was my first trip to the Humble Pie in Desert Ridge, though I had once been to the Scottsdale location (where I wasn't terribly impressed).  This time, however, I was quite pleased.  They had a nice lunch special for $8.95 (I think), which was for a personal size pizza and a salad (greens or caesar).  The personal pizza is supposed to be one particular flavor per day, but our waitress let us know that we could choose any from the menu, which was a nice touch.  I went with a pepperoni pizza and the caesar salad.  The caesar was nice, good flavor, and a fair amount of parmesan.  Another nice touch was the mesh wrapped lemon, keeping those pesky seeds out of your salad if you want fresh lemon juice on it.   The pizza, though, was definitely the star of the show.  Not only was it packed with pepperoni, this pepperoni had a great flavor to it.  Also a plus was the nice crisp crust...you could tell it was cooked perfectly, and that it came straight from the oven.    The worst part of the meal was that I totally spaced on getting their version of the pizookie!  Minus one star to me!  Four stars to Humble Pie though.

I went to San Felipe's at Desert Ridge for a happy hour on Friday night.  I had never been to this location, though a former version of myself may have been seen at San Felipe's Flagstaff in the club (and maybe even on the bar...).  I believe they took over the location where Fat Tuesday used to be.    I was quite impressed with their happy hour and their ability to accomodate a large group (10+).  The service was pretty good and the specials were very nice.  $2 per beer in the buckets that we were getting.  And while I didn't get any appetizers, they were half off, and the cheese crisp that someone else ordered looked pretty good.  I also liked that the happy hour ran from 4-7p.  Haven't been to Yard House for a happy hour for awhile, and it seemed like theirs ended at 6p.    Four stars for the good service, cold/cheap beers and good hours for happy hour.  Next time I plan a happy hour, San Felipe's will be on my list.

Went here on a recent Friday night to catch the tail end of their happy hour  (3-6pm) for dinner.  A lot of other people had this idea too, because not only did we have to park quite a ways away, Chuy's was packed out and we barely grabbed the last table available.    I had an order of two chicken enchiladas ($1.99), my wife had a quesadilla ($1.99) and I got a Baja Brew ($2).  With some guac on the quesadilla, and complimentary chips and salsa, total of less than $8, what a steal!    I was mad when I had the chicken enchiladas...mad that I only ordered one plate!  They were delicious.  I think what put them over the top was the strong mesquite broiled flavor from the chicken.  They were also nice and crisp with a good amount of cheese and sauce.  The quesadilla was okay, nothing special about it, and the chips weren't super fresh.   The beer was cold and had a nice flavor to it.  It had been awhile since I had been here, but I'm going to try to be back again soon for those chicken enchiladas!

I was nervous the first time I went to eat at Tiny's.  My apprehension has to do with their location...in the past three years, the spot they are in has housed no less than five restaurants.  What if I like Tiny's and they can't overcome the curse of this location?!?  The good news for Tiny's is that they have changed the model, all the previous occupants were basically fast food hamburger type places.  Tiny's is a sit-down restaurant, only open for breakfast and lunch (and I believe they are closed SUN/MON).  Last week, I popped in to try to get a to-go menu to try to convince the wife to give it a go.  Unfortunately, no to-go menus were available, so I just took a quick look at the menus.  Before I left, I chatted briefly with Tiny, who seemed nice.  This weekend, I had some family in town so we went there to try it out for breakfast.    No problem finding a table, but the restaurant was about half filled the whole time I was there.  We were quickly offered drinks and I got some of coffee.  The good news is that the coffee is only $.99 for a bottomless cup!  The not so good news is that it kind of tastes like $.99, nothing too special about the coffee.  To compare to one of my go-to breakfast places in town (The Place aka Mike & Ronda's), I ordered a similar meal as to what I'd get there.  I ordered two scrambled eggs w/ cheese, hash browns and homemade biscuits.  My wife ordered one of the daily specials, Banana Nut Pancakes.  I have to say, when the food came out, I was a little underwhelmed, my biscuits were not huge like I expected and my wife's pancakes did not have any visible bananas or nuts.  Upon eating however, the flavors did not let me down.  I made some nice egg/cheese/potato biscuit sammies which were good.  Plus, the food got better as I ate, and I always like that.  My wife didn't finish her pancakes, so I gave them a try.  I was pleasantly surprised with how stuffed they were with bananas and nuts.  They were very good.  I liked Tiny's, and even better, my wife did too.  I'm sure we will be back, though maybe next time for lunch to see how their chicken fried steak is.  Four stars for the good grub.  Hopefully they stick around.

Tried the Parlor for the first time on a recent weekend to celebrate a special occasion.  Arriving just before seven p.m. on a Saturday night, I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait and we were seating as soon as we got there.  Service was very friendly, efficient and quick.  I ordered a beer and the wife ordered a glass of wine and we decided to split the house greens and the pizza that comes with pesto/pine nuts/tomato.  The house greens were very good, plenty of pecans and chunks of gorgonzola.  The pie was also good, though it did seem a bit greasy.  Crust was nice and chewy, especially around the edges and had a good flavor.  Was also good the next day for lunch after a quick ride in the toaster oven.  For dessert we split an order of zeppoles, or if you prefer, fresh out-of-the-fryer donut holes.  I liked these and especially with the salted butter caramel sauce.  Much better than the beignets at Bourbon Steak.  One weird thing about these though...when we ordered them the server says, 'you haven't ordered these before have you?' and proceeds to tell us that they are still good, they just changed the recipe a little bit and something about orange rind/zest in the filling now.  This was weird because we specifically discussed that this was our first time in the restaurant!  Of course, I don't expect him to remember the details of every conversation he has with every table but still...  Also, out of six zeppoles/donut holes, only one bite with any strong orange flavor was noted.  Anywho, had a very good experience there, and wouldn't hesitate to return.

Citadelle's Twilight Farmers Market started up after their summer break a few weeks back.  They are open Wednesday evenings from 4 - 7pm (until sometime in May).  I went last week for the first time, and back again yesterday since it was so good.  Most farmer's markets I've been to in Phoenix are generally lame.  Mainly because there are 50% or more booths that are selling things like jewelry, knick-knacks or other things that to me belong more at a craft show than a farmer's market.  This one, however, is almost all food (the only booth I noticed, other than information, that wasn't food was a table for one of the stores in the plaza).  Two or three produce vendors, depending on the week, farm fresh eggs, grass-fed beef, bbq sauce, cider, granola, tamales, etc. etc.  My favorite though is the dairy guys with the fresh cheese curds.  You'd think you were eating a mouse the way these things squeek!  Definitely fresher than the ones at Trader Joes.  I am a huge fan of this farmer's market, and am sure all be back plenty of times over the fall/winter.  My only minor complaint is that they advertise as Arizona's only farmer's market under the stars...since I pretty sure that the Downtown Market goes on Wednesday night and there is a farmer's market now at Norterra (sucked...see above about non food vendors), it's not even remotely true.  4.9 stars, rounded up!

I was in the area recently checking out some of the stores at The Quarter and the wife and I decided to go to this location of Miracle Mile as I had some gift cards burning a hole in my pocket.  This location is similarly themed to the others ones in town, and being brand new (grand opening sign was still up on the north side of the building) everything was super clean.  I was also surprised at how many seats they had, seemed like there was probably over 200 seats.  Another nice touch in that department is that at a couple points in the queue, there were signs that said 'you will be served in x minutes'...very handy  seeing as how I'm sure they will have a lot of professionals in the area popping in for a quick lunch.    We ordered a Jax special (1.5 sandwiches) of the brisket on kaiser.  The brisket was good (even though my homemade is better :) ) and the kaiser roll was excellent.  The horseradish to supplement was nice and spicy, gave a good kick.  Also had a nice Dr. Brown's Black Cherry soda to go with it...hey when at a jewish deli...   The one drawback of the meal, which is always hit or miss at Miracle Mile, was the fries.  Seems like 50% of the time, I get fries that are definitely not old, but they are definitely not fresh.  I can't fathom why this happens so often, especially with the volume of people that they run through there.    Other than the fries, as mentioned, everything else was good, including the service.  In fact, they had someone carry our tray to the table for us, which is something I can never remember happening before.  Nice touch.  Definitely I will be back to the MM locations across the valley.

We recently tried Mellow Mushroom once we saw that it finally opened after seeing the signs for quite awhile.  Part of our motivation was a coupon for a free appetizer that we received in the mail.  Headed there for a late lunch on a recent weekend.  Thought it would be crowded due to the lunch time hour, but we were able to get a seat quickly, with plenty of tables available.  We ordered the Capri salad as our appetizer.  This was okay...part of the problem was the tomatoes weren't great (I know, not in season right now), but the mozzarella they used was so-so at best.  The slices weren't very big either.  For our meal, we were going to share a half meatball hoagie and a small Kosmic Karma (pesto, spinach, sd tomatoes, feta) pizza.  (I must not have been listening to my wife, because we only shared the pizza, and I got all the meatball hoagie, score for me!)  I also ordered a root beer from the tap.  All of the food was very good.  I really liked the pizza, and the meatball sub was quite tasty as well.  Both also reheated well the next day in the toaster oven.  Other than the salad, the food was really good, and I'm looking forward to going back to try some other things.  The service was okay, still some kinks since they had just opened.  It was super friendly though.  One thing I might be apprehensive about if I were to eat there on a regular basis...it seemed like the prices were a little bit high...not sure why, but seemed like a huge jump in price from their small to their large pies...but they tasted good so they have that going for them.  Pretty sure I'll be back.

Starbucks was having a happy hour promotion for about 10 days recently, where between 3-5PM you could get half price frappucinos.  I (or my wife) went four times over the promotion.  75% of the time our order was screwed up in some way, shape or form (whip when no whip was requested, caramel flavor when should have been coffee, venti when it should have been grande, etc.).  The drinks still tasted good, but dag, that is a pretty poor success rate.  Service was (and usually) is pretty friendly at least.    Now the question...if I want a caramel/coffee ice blended drink...who am I going to choose, McD's or Starbucks...

The wife and I went here on a recent date night before meeting some friends in Scottsdale for some bowling.  We arrived around 5:30 and were able to be seating on the patio quickly (luckily it wasn't too hot yet).  Our server was with us quickly, and was pleasant/helpful/friendly the hole time.    For starters, we got the truffle fries which were good.  Nice and warm and crispy, and I liked the little dipping sauce that came with them.  For my burger, they had a special of the day which was a turkey burger with avocado/swiss.  I liked the sounds of the topping, but not so much of the turkey burger, and it was no problem for me to get the 'special burger toppings' on the beef burger.  To wash down my burger, I ordered the Creme Brulee milkshake.  The burger came out and was very good...I would definitely go there again for a high-quality burger.  The milkshake, it wasn't great, definitely good, but not great.  There just wasn't a strong enough creme brulee flavor for me.    The wife had some sort of veggie burger that she liked and a glass of wine that she also enjoyed.  We thought that the bill was reasonable.  We would definitely consider going back to Zinburger.

Agree with the previous reviewer...meh.  We tried Fast Eddie's for breakfast with a family member who was in town.  Service was ok.  Food was okay, but the pancakes definitely seemed like they were from a mix.  I also think I had some sickness later due to the food, so that is definitely a mark against them.  At least it was a decent value.  All things considered, with all the other breakfast options in the area that I do like, I doubt that I'll be back.

I was thinking the poor experience was due to first night or weekend jitters, while they were working the kinks out.  Unfortunately, when I checked the previous reviews I see that they have been open a couple weeks now.    Was there a problem with the food?  Oh, not particularly, but we didn't get our food for 20+ minutes and it was clear that the fries had been sitting out for a little while .  I guess it was cool that they gave us a heads up when we were ordering that it was taking awhile, but this was ridiculous, considering it was not that crowded (I've seen longer lines at the Camelback location with 1/2 the wait time for the food).  Additionally, we saw at least one party who went to complain about the wait time be told that their order had been mistakenly given to someone else!    So while the food was fine...at this point in time, service is pretty bad.  Hopefully time will help solve the problem, but I doubt I'll ever see the inside of this Smashburger again.
