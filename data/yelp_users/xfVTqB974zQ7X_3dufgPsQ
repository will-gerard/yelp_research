My favorite smoothie place has always been Tropical Smoothie Cafe. They no longer exist so Jamba juice is my new go to!  The employees are usually friendly. The menu is big so anyone and everyone can find something that's perfect.  They used to have more of a selection for boosts. I like the new idea for the fruit and veggie smoothies. What happened to the acai smoothie that was on the menu?

I'm obsessed with HOT and SOUR soup done extra spicy with seafood. I could eat it every day!

This company is the bees and EEES!  I would recommend them to all my family and friends, and so should you.  I've had my windshields replaced on all my vehicles and tint install and tint was seamless.

The food was pretty good.  They had a good selections of salsas which my hubby and I live for.  Over priced TINY margaritas.  Service was HORRIBLE!  I will never come back.
