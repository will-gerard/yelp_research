Rated "10 best family restaurant chains". Fine, two reasons to hate it.

Seriously? Shut up. This place blows. Wouldn't last 4 minutes in NY. I'll bet the Vegas store doesn't last either.  This place insults the pizza.

This Wendy's is no better than any other Wendy's. However Wendy's is probably the best of the fast food joints.

Riva's is the flip side of Mexican fast food. Meaning Philiberto's can go suck it!  They seem exactly like any other Mexican fast food joint. To the untrained eye there is no difference...then you get your food and taste the salsa.   WOW! Someone knows what they are doing. This place consistently kicks out quality food that satisfies. I have always been very happy at the end of the meal, and later on as well!  Drive through as well!

"I have never gotten sick from this place" shouldn't be a positive review. I haven't...but still. I stopped going here the second time I got an incorrectly rolled burrito. I mean c'mon! The name of the place is Filibertos and the entire staff is Mexican! Incorrectly rolled burritos? TWICE!?!?! WTF?  It'll work for me if its 230am and I am in a car that is already going through the drive through. I have often made the decision to go to Denny's across the street for late night grub. They've never f'ed up a burrito there!

I really try to be understanding about food taking some time. I am very willing to wait for quality food. Its actually my tagline for yelp...however, this place takes too long to get my to go chow mein out, I mean...its chow mein! I order it because its quick.  Wouldn't be so bad if it were better, or I could get the guys behind the counter to give me duck sauce at least.  BTW, what is it with Chinese places and duck sauce? They seem to act as if they have never heard of it, every time. Although it says 'duck sauce' right on it. If you only get it when you order duck, fine. Tell me that, I can accept limitations. Its just when there is a blank stare or, even better, a "We don't have that" (when I can clearly see it) that annoys me.  You get a good amount of food, its pricey though, a drink and dish, not a combo, are over $10. Again, if it were better...

If you are a driver for Safeway, you already know about this place. Otherwise, unless you bike to AZ Mills Mall or REI regularly, you will probably NEVER see this place. Without Google maps you'd never find it, with Google maps you might have a little trouble. Hell, I lived in Tempe for over a decade and did regularly bike to REI and AZ Mills, I never saw it!  This little cafe on the north side of Alameda is just east of Priest drive on the north side of the street, across from the Safeway distribution center. There are a lot of trucks around so if you are riding a bike, be careful!  Once you find it in the unremarkable office park that it is part of (look for the tables and wind mills) park in one of  the ample spots. There is a menu above the counter but the better menu is the one on the counter. It tells you what is in the awesome sandwiches. Or just get the special. The specials are excellent.   They also make a seriously good breakfast and have some great coffee, pies, pastries...etc. Their food is just good, it comes from a kitchen that cares about making food!

The owner may claim to be simply 'politically incorrect' however that is a statement that I have heard from many a racist before. Its the same as saying, "I'm not a racist, I just believe in genetic purity."   I was unhappy to be at the receiving end of a rant that wandered from how he threw his wife's food out because she'd put salt on it. Which apparently offended him as a chef...or something. In my opinion that is abusive, controlling, misogynist behavior that is reprehensible. It at least points to an inability to communicate and a sharp need to be correct, perhaps a dangerous need.  Furthermore, his referencing 'Lousy-anna' referring to Lousiana, the Shreveport area if I remember correct, became tiresome immediately. He called the population of the area he used to live, please forgive me, niggers! His claim that he was referencing the white and black population fell short when he told a story of catching a young black child he caught stealing. He apparently asked the child why he was stealing and was offended that the answer as that "You whites have been stealing from us for years."  I had to leave to get to work, I would have left just as quickly had I not had to be at work 5 minutes later. My only regret was that I had to leave my poor girlfriend there...  Sir, if you wish to be a racist (excuse me: Politically Incorrect) you can do it without my dollars lining your pocket. I am sad to no longer have a place on my way to work that I could stop to grab a bite. I am truly discomfited riding my bike past the cafe and seeing that you are still in business.   If you like your breakfast with a side of racism and misogyny, eat here. If you are a Russell Pearce, Joe Arpaio, or SB1070 supporter, here is your place.   If you feel that people should not be judged, eat somewhere else. Somewhere that doesn't just dress up in bible verse, perhaps somewhere that embraces christian values, not just trite statements everywhere you look.

I am not sure what happened here in the valley to make this place popular enough to have TV commercials...but, it was not something that is good!   I am from the east coast, so all you east coast haters go ahead and hate (I am not going back there, I want everyone to have good food...evreywhere). If one of these opened in New York, the syndicates would burn it down as a mercy killing. It would be too poorly executed to exist.   I am not sure whether that was Marinara sauce, but that's kinda the issue isn't it. The chicken on the Chicken Parmigiana might have been some sort of tender at some point, that's kinda the issue isn't it though.   Its as if whoever owns this place worked at Denny's or IHOP and figured their cost cutting measures would work just as well for Italian food...  Whatever, I look forward to this place going under. Seems too many 'native' Phoenicians have fond memories of coming here when they were kids with their relatives though. Let it go already. Will you stop eating crap just because of nostalgia?

I am pretty sure Ted's has its status as a go to place here in AZ because of nostalgia. There are many places out here that are really not that great but because growing up these poor bastards had no good food are way over-rated at this point. Ted's dogs are passable, their brats are just poor. The fries are awful. The last time I went there I had to fight vomiting for a bit after, I had two hot dogs (not usually a nausea inducing amount). Thankfully there are better places popping up all the time now. Better step it up Ted's all those people who've been going here for years are gonna die and you'll be out of luck.   Also the teenage staff makes the experience no better!

Palo Verde is a true Dive Bar Gem, its one of those places that you have to experience to really have lived here in Tempe. Drinks are cheap, I once got a double of Glenfidich for $4.50. Its easy to bring a group and take over, the bartender will usually wrangle the more vocal regulars (as long as your group is spending cash)   BTW bring CASH! There is no credit here!  If you can make it from 2am until 6am you can begin your morning here, as far as I remember (and the memories of that night are hazy at best) with a happy hour attended by the third shift from the milk plant down the block.  This is not a bar to bring a date to, a partner that you have been with a while...awesome! If you bring a first date and she has a good time, it'll probably be with someone else.

I have had many different experiences in little restaurants that are kitchy and just off the main road. Sometimes they are awesome. This one, not so much. The service was fine and the decor was expectedly kitchy, however the food...was just bland.   My sandwich might have been the spiciest thing on the menu, Sarah had enchiladas which were sooo bland it was kind of a shock. Not sure if there how there would be a lack of good Mexican food here in Occupied Mexico, I can only imagine it has something to do with the giant 'anti-Obama' signs just down the road. Oh well, lickily there are other good places to eat in Wickenburg.   I did hear another couple discussing how good the prime rib was. It is prime rib though..how difficult is that?

The first thing you notice is that there is a bar that is like a giant aquarium in this well lit, plain little restaurant. Apparently that is how restaurant/bars can get around the new Nevada smoking laws. It did seem that there were smokers in the aquarium, and we, in the restaurant, experienced no smoking related incidents.  The staff was chaotic. We had a group of 7 including a toddler. Not the easiest group ever to deal with but...not too bad for an experienced server. We had an inexperienced server, buffered by a busboy and the manager/owner. All together, they made the experience go from bad to not so bad.  They have a great selection of microbrew beers as well as corporate domestics. However, our waitress did not know what they were (for example she listed Stone Brewery as one of their beers, when asked what beer it was she had to check...for each of the microbrews on the list). There was also no list of beers. The poor girl had to read all the beers from a list she made herself. I felt kind of bad for her but, I did want a good beer. Ended up getting Lagunitas IPA, a fine beer and the price was not bad.  The wine had a similar issue. Which was odd, most Italian places make such a big deal about wine. Again there was no list. When asked what the wines were, the waitress said there was red and white. It felt like I was in the Southeast! Finally the manager realized, sort of, what was happening and explained that they were redoing their wine list and were featuring one red and one white from an extensive collection until they finalized their choices. We ended up with an excellent Chianti at a great price.  I have an entire list here on Yelp dedicated to  Chicken Parmigiana sandwiches. I ordered the meal, as I consider myself a connoisseur of them, and got a chicken parmigiana plate over pasta. I enjoy that meal also, so was fine with eating it. However, I did order a sandwich specifically. When I informed the manager of this she happily reapplied the charge for the sandwich instead of the pasta dish. In her place I would have dropped the meal entirely (6 meals, a bottle of wine, two deserts, beers and soft drinks would have been enough for a table0. However, her decision was fine also.  I would head back here, largely to see if there was any improvement  with time or to see how hanging out in the bar would be. Apparently they have football on Sundays so perhaps next season.

Gaetano's is an Italian family restaurant. This is family style eating at its finest. Anyone who comes in is treated like a guest who entered the living room and is welcome to come into the dining room. Hey guest! What are you doing in the kitchen! (Just kidding, but don't go into the kitchen).   The food is astoundingly good and puts other 'family style italian gardens' absolutely to shame. I don't care how many plates of food those places throw at you, you only need one plate of Gaetano's and you'll have some to take home. They'll do birthdays, parties or just dinner. No matter what, make a reservation. They won't let the place get crowded enough that you can't get service.   The bar is wonderful. My sister-in-law and I spent an entire night making up martinis with the bartender. It was so much fun. The bartenders are totally engaging and enjoy making new and interesting drinks.  Go and enjoy Gaetano's. Get the espresso to end the meal and have a drink after at the bar. Its a wonderful establishment and you feel good the minute you walk in the door.

Seamus is quick sort of, easy sort of, and its not bad. There always seems to be a group of douche bags at the entry that might be security, might just be guys who are friends with the bar staff. Either way in three trips, they were always there and annoying as hell.   The food is...meh (to quote my rating). I had the Chicken Parmesan, I am pretty sure it was Chicken tenders. Either way it was not anything special.   Not a bad place to go to before going to a game or show. It won't be as busy as the spots right down town. If it is busy though, don't wait. You'll only get angry that you waited.

Let's get this straight. The ice cream was excellent. However, I had called to check the closing time and was told that it was 9pm. Although any information I could find on the internets said 10pm. OK, the internets are not always correct.   My girlfriend and I walked up there and got there around 8pm. The sign on the door listed the closing time as 10pm. The front door was locked. We could see people entering through the back and enjoying ice cream inside so went around the back. A sign in marker was on the door saying that the food kitchen was closed and all we could get was ice cream. That was fine as that was all we desired.  We entered and went to the hostess stand/'Please wait to be seated' sign. A staff member dressed in pink shirt came up and asked if we wished to be seated. We said yes and she grabbed some menus. There were many booths available. However, she led us to a half booth with ridiculously uncomfortable chairs on one side. I asked about sitting in the open booths and she explained that since they close at 9pm that section was closed. She gave us the menus and we seated ourselves on one side of the booth so as not to have to sit on the uncomfortable wire chairs. The menu stated clearly that closing time was 10pm.  A waitress in a gray shirt came by and was very helpful as the menu is complicated, apparently dips are scoops (I thought dips were the liquid that went on the cone, that's a different place though), she explained the menu and then came back to take our order after a delay that was longer than I'd expect, they were busy though.   During the interim I took a look around and noted that the 'open' seating area had filled. Now people were indeed being seated in the 'closed' area. The staff members seemed to be arrayed in pink, gray, and black (for the kitchen staff) except for one guy who seemed to be assisting in a flannel shirt and jeans. The customer seated behind me noted that he had received his sundae in a Styrofoam cup and that he remembered having them in glass previously. I did not know what he ordered. I knew that my single scoop with two toppings was costing $5.50, a Styrofoam cup would be insulting. Low and behold, our sundaes were delivered to the table in Styrofoam. The pictures I have seen also show glassware.   This was very disappointing. I am not sure if the staff had simply decided to close early for the evening or if there was some kind of issue with the dishwasher...I don't know (and we were told nothing except closing time was 9pm) what was going on. The only thing I am sure of is that no matter how great the ice cream is, it is important to run a tight ship. I am not sure if there was a manager there, if there was they should be fired.  The night was 3/9/11.   The ice cream was excellent.

Ocean Floor is an awesome shop. I wish it were easier to get to. Its weird that a store with 3 highways in proximity would be so difficult to actually drive to!  Nonetheless, the selection of aquarium accoutrement is bar none the finest I have seen in the valley. Need a 4 foot piece of would for that 150 gallon tank, its here. Need to build a freshwater rock reef, they got that. Staff is cool and courteous.   Hopefully they get seminars and fish geek meetings going again. Great place to visit though!

Home of the $30,000 millionaire, fake breasts, fake calves, fake lips hips and faces. Scottsdale is a ridiculous town full of places that take themselves too seriously and people that think their chain restaurants are 'quirky' and interesting.   Also, for some reason, they have decided that a lagging left is a better option than a leading. As if having all those extra cars at the intersection for a longer period of time is better for everyone. Secretly I think the reason that they want those making lefts to go last is because of the ties to left and sinister behavior. Only the poor have to go left, they must be punished for being poor.   Each day that I enter Scottsdale I die a little inside.

I know, its annoying to all you AZ peeps when I say, "I grew up in NY with good food." I accept that it is impossible for you to understand what it is like to rarely have bad bread, bad cold cuts, bad service or just plain have a place that isn't trying staying around. Of course, us east coaster's are leaving out all the corporate places; the same Chili's, Applebees, Boston Market...etc stores are back east as well (most of them) and they suck just as bad there as they do here. What we mean is that the places that everyone goes to in our old neighborhoods are like Defalco's.   Defalco's is like no other place I have been to here in AZ. They have amazing food, great bread, Boar's Head cold cuts, and italian groceries that I didn't even realize I couldn't find until I saw them here. Amazing...just amazing.   They have chicken cutlets. NO ONE IN AZ HAS THESE! It is kind of ridiculous that an easy to make, menu staple (in the east) is impossible to find out here. I have seen them on menus, they were actually chicken tenders. Cutlets are chicken breast, breaded with Italian spices and egg, pan-fried and then baked. Defalco's has awesome cutlets! They use them on their Chicken Parmesan sandwich as well. That blew me away!   They also have Dilusso Genoa Salami, if you haven't had it...you haven't had salami! This gem of a store is a constant stop when I am anywhere near it, or have family visiting. If you haven't been...just go!  Side note: If you are expecting to be told what is on the sandwich, give up eating sandwiches. When you order, tell them the things you enjoy eating on bread, they'll assemble it, bring it to you and then you eat it. It ain't Quiznos or Subway, this is good food. If you can't figure it out, walk away and eat crap, come back when you know what you like!

Four Peaks has been a great place to go eat and drink for many years now. Easily the best bar food menu around. Excellent bread and appetizers, very well done southwestern fare and amazing specials (I still haven't had one of their specials as they are usually pricey, they look amazing though!).   They have a great beer selection, as long as you are not looking for bud/miller/coors. Its all Four Peaks beer on the menu, makes for a nice change and a great taster! At the beginning of every month you can get the Hopsquatch, their barrel aged Barleywine, it doesn't last far beyond the beginning of the month. Seasonally they have a number of brews that are super-tasty (Pumpkin Porter, Peche...et al). You can also get growlers of their beers to take home and fill when you are there.  I finally did brunch here, it is awesome. They do brunch better than most places that specialize in it! The breakfast croissant should be a regular menu item (OK that's one special I have had).

This place is a cool idea. Its like Subway for Pitas. Only, its like Subway for Pitas.   The staff can be downright crotchety at times about what 'kind' of pita you are getting. There is also an issue with the staff knowing how to make a pita at times. I've watched them roll the pita with absolute horror at times! The pita is supposed to hold the food, not just be around it.

Its a fun gimmick but, why would I go back here? Its not like there's a paucity of good burger places around. I realized I could stop when I saw that they just had the same place everywhere, and I mean everywhere. Its kind of depressing, especially after you get all clogged with Fatburger. Seriously, give it up. This place isn't that good, just familiar if you are from the west.

I love this place for nostalgia's sake. I always seem to end up disappointed by the time I walk out.   My last two visits have been for brunch, perhaps that was my downfall. They really do not do brunch well.  First off, when someone asks for egg whites, "we have tofu" is not an answer. If you are using eggs, egg whites are part of them. If you claim to not have them, it makes me wonder if you are using some sort of egg premix that cannot be separated.  Furthermore, there is no sausage or bacon on the menu. I can totally wrap my head around there being little meat on the menu, and that there is a possibility of a religious exclusion of pork. Whatever, welcome to the 21st century! Chicken sausages are awesome! Turkey bacon and other fowl meats work beautifully!   I like some meat with breakfast, grilled chicken just doesn't cut it (to be fair, I haven't had the grilled chicken, doesn't sound appetizing).  Get the damn protesters off your street too! They suck ass!

Ah Tessios, sometimes great and sometimes not so great. Always available though! These guys make a good pie, and they'll bring it to you. There are other places that bring you pie that is no good and other places that make good pizza. No one else does so at midnight though, or 1:30 in the morning on Fri and Sat.   My advice is don't have more than two slices. That's important to know! Their sandwiches are nothing to write home about but are good, their desserts are actually very good!  Tessio's will always be there for you, that's the important part. Also they used to be T C Luigis.

This IHOP is just like every other IHOP except for its proximity to ASU campus. I have eaten there so many times that I cannot even count them. All due to proximity and availability, never due to desire.   This is the only restaurant I have watched someone get sick in. It is packed after the bars get out at 2am. It is busy all night. Often with those who are under 21 but over 18 drinking coffee and acting as though it is their living room.   Go here for sustenance only!!

After mowing over an orange and having my mower chug to an unceremonious stop, I called Phil's. I had heard that there was a great lawnmower place on McClintock. I guess this is where they meant.   The woman who answered the phone was really awful. I asked her how much it would be to find out what was wrong with my mower and she asked me how she would know. So, I tried again explaining about the orange and it stopping. She then informed me that she ran over oranges all the time and it never stopped her mower. While that info was extremely helpful, I still had no idea whether it would be worth it to bring my lawnmower in, so I asked her if I should. She said it would be $120-$150 for a tune-up, but still nothing about how much to just figure out what is wrong...  I finally asked her about bringing it in, she said she'd be there until later that day. I wasn't going to be able to head down that day so asked when was good to come by, she said any time but lunch hour. Lunch hour fluctuated each day though...so I asked if I should call first. Finally she straight up said yes!   I found another guy on the webs that does tune ups for $40 and said it was free to figure out if that was what it needed. I am thinking I'll go there...

The food here is good. Expensive though.  The Guinness pours are good. Expensive though.  Good whiskey selection...noticing a trend?  This place is expensive, especially for what it is. I mean, it is an 'authentic' Irish bar, brought piece by piece from Ireland...but aren't they all now? There are so many 'authentic' Irish bars that there is actually a cottage industry in salvaging pieces of Irish pubs and sending the pieces to America.   I don't think it should mean that everything is $2 more than it should be.   The food is good though!

Mexican barbecue, as good as it gets!  Two stories, one funny, one stupid:  Tempe Urban Legend: At one point El Pollo Supremo had a fire. The staff of East Side Records (RIP) had to evacuate as well as they shared a wall. As the firefighters arrived, one turned to the other and exclaimed, "We have to save this place! Their chicken is awesome!" Don't you want to eat at a place that the Fire Department is desperate to save?  As I was standing around bullshitting outside a friends shop in Tempe one day, a girl in her early twenties was hanging out as well. The smell of the grills at El Pollo wafted over and she asked, "What is that place? Smells good!" "El Pollo Supremo" I said, "Mexican Barbecue." "Oh I hate Mexican food!" she said...too dumb to listen to her own nose!   Tip: Don't ever let racism get in the way of eating at a place that your own nose tells you is good!  My favorite part about El Pollo Supremo is that they have chicken or beef. No substitutions is up on the menu, I am not sure what you'd substitute though as there is also a half chicken half beef option. Tortillas, red onions (eerily red), beans and salsa come with your chicken and beef.  Get some Horchata, do it right!

I was distraught when Pets Inc got rid of their dog and cat food section. I figured was now being forced to go to the corporate mega chains that don't have any of the good food anyway...  Alas, right down the block from my house was a place I had missed, Tempe Feed & Tack! I had always thought that they were just for horse stuff. Indeed, they are for horse stuff. As well as many different farm animals and pets. However they also have dog and cat food!  They have some of the best foods on the market, Blue Buffalo, Innova...etc. They accept competitor's coupons and give case discounts. They even have VIP dog toys, which are super tough (not tough enough for my lab...but what is?).  Excellent place to shop: small, local, and friendly!

Otto's is a gem of Tempe. Great ingredients make great pizza and sandwiches. You may have heard that from some other pizza place, that's because they are trying to convince you of something. At Otto's they wouldn't even think to mention their ingredients because you have no question whether or not this is good food!  Their Chicken Parmigiana is divine. Simply one of the tastiest I've had here in AZ. Excellent sauce, tender chicken, great cheese...leaves you wishing there were more but unable to figure what you'd do with it.  Get Pizzas delivered or to eat there for a group or by the slice for yourself. For dessert try one of their excellent pastries and cakes, it is in the name for a reason!

They've just never been a bike store that is really pro cycling, I mean not really there for cyclists. Everything is an argument, the work they do sucks, they have cheap bikes that are better than department store shit, but only just better...

So many people have never been to this Sacks. It certainly doesn't help that there seems to be no parking anywhere near them (there is, its in front of the business!). It also doesn't help that there are almost 3 acres of parking lot separating it from University and it is almost invisible from Mill. Nonetheless, Sacks makes ridiculously good sandwiches. They have the best ingredients (fresh crisp spinach and sprouts, amazing sauces) and excellent bread.  They also have breakfast, it is wonderful. There "Build your own" breakfast wrap (burrito) is a regular for me.  You can always order one of their sandwiches, choose an interesting special (cold sandwich, hot sandwich, or salad), build your own salad, and answer a trivia question for a free drink!   The staff is fun, especially when they are super hung-over at 8:30 in the morning! Call them on the hang over, you'll usually get an invite to a party.  They can be super busy at lunch, they get really efficient then though. The concept is kind of brilliant in its simplicity (like art). No matter what you order, it comes in sack that is the same bag they write your order and name on. They'll call out your name and leave the bag for you to pick up. You can then eat there or take it wherever you like!   Special Hint: During the summer they are open 7am until 2pm but are almost never busy so its great to go!

I have been in here 3 times in the 13 years I have lived in proximity to it.  First time to replace a rear tire that had been stolen from my bike. Turns out it is way cheaper to buy a new bike than replace that tire. Nonetheless, they were pretty aloof about the whole thing.  Second time I was looking for a nice cruiser with gears and grip brakes. They had one...but not cheap at all! They were pretty uncaring as well.  Third, my buddy's Schwinn was stolen on my watch. This was the time that they were the nicest to me. However, he decided to get a different bike. The replacement was expensive.  I have not had reason to head back there...don't know that I ever will. One not so bad time does not make me loyal.

Ambiance, excellent food, a great selection of fine liquor. It is hard to get better than House of Tricks. One of Tempe's gems that we can all hope will not be gentrificated out of existence (I'm looking at you Tempe City Council!).   This little setup of a yard between two little houses holding a bar between them is truly a place of solace in the valley. It always seems to be cool at Tricks (probably because they smartly close for most of the summer).   I have been here for lunches, nights of drinking, a wedding reception and even a fancy work dinner party. They seem to be able to deliver on the small or large scale with aplomb and style. Truly a feat to be lauded down the block from Mill where those words have little meaning.   Be sure to go on a winter night when they have the fireplace going. It feels like you are transported to somewhere that has winters!

I very rarely find anything here that I like. I respect the local business built from the ground up...just not what I am ever looking for in clothing. Also, the  employees can be pretty rude and dismissive, even as they demand that you stand there while they look through your stuff. I prefer to do other things with my time.

You want your burger brought to you as you sit there like a lump? You want detailed lists of ingredients and cooking styles...? You don't go to a barbecue for that!   The Chuck Box is a barbecue. They are the best burger in the Valley. There are a great number of things you can put on your burger. Here's the trick, KNOW WHAT YOU WANT ON A BURGER. That's pretty easy, you've just been trained to be told whats on your burger. Get a Big One with Green Peppers, Jalapeno Jack and Barbecue sauce. Get a Chicken Sandwich with Pineapples. Get one of the best veggie Burgers I've ever had!  Anyone who rates this place poorly is just not happy about standing there waiting for their burger and having to pay cash. If you are spoiled, get the hell out of this joint and eat at Denny's, they give a f$@# about what you want. You are at a barbecue, the cook will take care of you, just be nice!  Love this place!

Seems they switched their veggie burger to some sort of store bought crap. Which sucks, they had an awesome veggie burger. Oh well, its lucky I'm an omnivore!   Still an awesome place to eat, but I miss that veggie burger!

I am not sure who remembers that this place had an old location. It is now a gravel lot next to Jack in the Crack on Mill. That spot was a go to place. Some of the best food I had in AZ. It was a small place, intimate and cozy. Great for dates!  The new place...meh, not so much. Nowhere near as cozy, its more like a corporate bar. Their focus seems to be more on drinks than food, which is really unfortunate because the food was what kept me coming back.

Hard to blame the stadium for all of the sucky games I have seen here (excepting when the Mets are in town).  This really is a nice ball park. Its also great that there are almost always cheap seats, and they have a damn good view. I have sat in the lower level and the upper level, never the 200s.   I like the local businesses that have popped up in here. They are the worst of the local chains and corporate places but...whatever.  Craft beer bombers (22oz) are only a dollar more than corn and rice beer! (Miller Lite and Bud Light respectively). That is way too expensive, but nice in relative terms. I am happy to spend an extra dollar to get an American owned beer (not owned by Europe like Budweiser) that is made with barley (see above mentioned rice and corn statement).  Its awesome that there is no smoking in the stadium any more. The old smoking area sucked! Going outside the entire stadium is way better, and more fun talking to the other smokers about the game when its not on a TV right there!  Sometimes the bathrooms are way overzealous, like when the Brewers play and there are 70 urinals for me and one other guy to choose from.   If you like baseball, go to BOB er...Chase field. Yell at D-bagster (Baxter the BOBcat to me and always will be!) Boo the D-bax, at some point it always seems to happen. Hopefully cheer when they do well, even if you are there to see the other team (as most of us are when we visit Chase field) it is always polite and appreciated to root for the home team, good baseball is good baseball, no matter who your team is!

I guess if you get to the top its a great view of the urban sprawl that surrounds this poor smog strangled mountain. Of course, there are railings and fences along the way. Just in case you were actually thinking you were experiencing nature, or something like that. Of course it is difficult to think you are actually hiking or in nature with the promenade of people who should probably be at Fashion Square constantly move up, down, around or with you.  The best part, this mountain abuts Paradise Valley. THE richest part of Phoenix. There is a port-o-potty in the parking lot. No bathroom, no visitors center, a single port-o-potty in the parking lot.   I had a good laugh about how, in Phoenician parlance, ghetto that is. North Mountain has actual bathrooms and a visitors center y'know. Its also got better parking, nicer hills and a better view.   South Mountain's got canyons you can get lost in.  Papago has red rock formations.   So yeah, Camelback is Meh, I have seen better!

This place looks awesome. The smell of the maple syrup blasts the air while you wait on line to get in. Granted, outside of Vegas(ahem, Henderson) I am pretty sure their is no line.  The food, well it is not that great. It certainly doesn't inspire me to come back and try other menu items. More or less inspires me to wish I hadn't paid so much for the food!  Like so many national chain stores, great look, great concept. Just no real delivery of something worthwhile. It also tries to play the 'Olde Fashioned Game' with locations nationwide and corporate reps throughout the business...its about as old fashioned as the Casino that its in.

Mexico authentico! This is a real mexican restaurant. No gringo bullshit with sombrero statues and pictures of texan missions. Just plain old excellent mexican food. They don't drown your food in salsa, because the food is good. You could certainly put the salsa on your food, it doesn't belong there though...it belongs on your chips! Which they make there.  The Clare Burro is phenomenal, I have also had the chimichanga and enchiladas, but return for the Clare most often. Its got whole beans! So good...  Not only that, but Restaurant Mexico has been in business for over 25 years, has survived numerous losses of physical building location, something that has killed so many other businesses. Impressive, because of its impressive food!

Great little coffee shop made from an old gas station. Very old school, vintage appeal. Has a drive through and makes some tasty coffee! They usually have some entertainment during the weekend and are pretty quick. Great patio.  If you are hitting the Melrose district for some vintage shop exploration, start here. It sets an awesome tone for the neighborhood and coffee is great before walking to 7 or 8 stores.

The two times I have been here the food was very good.   The service and management are absolutely atrocious. Once we were rushed through our meal because we were sat near closing time. That time it was not the manager doing the rushing.   Even better, on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, myself and my girlfriend brought another couple that we had told about Ticoz. We arrived at 7:30 and the front door was open. The special board listed some excellent specials, some kind of Pork Chili Macaroni and Cheese (there Mac n Cheese is phenomenal!). After looking at the board and discussing seating amongst ourselves, the manager approached and told us the kitchen closed 45 minutes ago and they were closed for the evening.   Come to think of it, when we pulled up a car was pulling out after a driver got in. Also, as we left another group (5 nurses) showed up. as we got in our car another two vehicles pulled up. We counted 16 people they turned away in the 5-10 minutes we were there. I made snide remarks to the manager he exclaimed, "We had no one here for 3 hours!" Which bothers me for two reasons: first, it is very hard to believe and I think he was lying; second, of course you wont be busy on the Sunday of memorial day during the regular dinner hour. Everyone was at barbecues or pools. However, the late dinner hour will be busy. This has been true for bars and restaurants for a long time.   Ticoz might be good, if you don't get rushed or told to leave. Me, I'll spend my money at a place that wants it. If Ticoz thinks I can go somewhere else...I do too!

Its a bar in an airport so they kind of have you over a barrell. The bartenders are usually pretty friendly. The prices are over the top and the food is not so good. I'd say what do you expect its in an airport, but I have had good reasonably priced food in airports...just not in PHX Sky Harbor.

I hope you like salt and have never had Asian food before beyond Panda Express or Kyoto bowl.  The fact that PF Chang's is allowed to exist by China (to whom the US owes its existence). Here's a tip for Asian cuisine: are there Asian's there? If the answer is no...  I have never had more consistently bad service and tasting food. I cannot requisite ever going there again. I recommend yo skip it. If you are looking for Chinese food in the valley give this a wide berth.  BTW Pei Wei is also PF Changs. I would review them separately but cannot get up the ambition to discuss bad memories any more...

Stinkweeds is the real deal record shop! Local, indie, underground, staff that knows its biz. Great store and I am sad that there is only one location left. Hopefiully, it can stay around in these days of music purchasing being an afterthought to the download.   Nothing quite like hanging in a record shop checking out stuff and listening to the picks of the clerk.

After hitting some other places and experiencing Wag N' Wash more I have to lower my rating. There are two main issues that annoy me.   The staff pay is apparently commission, or at least sales, based. Which means that they will not leave you alone to just look around and make a decision about products! This would be less annoying if they were trained better I have received conflicting information from two different staff members about the same product...that raises a flag. One of them is wrong but they are really trying to sell stuff to you!  Furthermore, their dog wash area is nice and well kept. However the dog baths require you to get your dog into them. Which is tricky if you have a big dog, especially after the wash when the floor is wet and you have to get the dog out. After my first experience, when my dog slipped, I asked a staff member if their was a better way that might keep my dog from hitting his legs when he slipped...they just nonchalantly said that it was what happened all the time.  Even better, the drying area is separate from the washing area and requires you to take your wet dog into another room, lift them onto another platform and then use the driers on them. Why not just dry them in the tub?  I'd suggest going to Smelly Dog up the street, their tubs lift up for you and you dry the dog right there, also their staff is happier and friendlier!

I have been going to here since the day that it opened and even had them cater my graduation party when I got my degree from ASU. If you cannot appreciate Cornish Pasty Co you have some sort of problem dealing with restaurants.   They will not molly coddle and treat you like you are some sort of special patron. They are just too busy providing some of the best pasties ever created. Service is not what you come here for, pasties are!  Be sure to ask them what the Vegan selections are, they are usually pretty amazing. Especially if you put gravy on them! (The gravy is totally not vegan, neither am I...having evolved as an omnivore).   Now they have a patio, as well as more seating and a nice bike rack! Classing it up CP! Just kidding, this place is not classy, which is why it is so beautiful and amazing.

This place looks the part. Great decor. The food is Macayo's level. Just add $2-$4 per item. A Chimichanga for $14! Even with rice and beans...I can get a number of Chimicangas for $8-$9 that taste at least as good as this one...  I don't really know the draw to this place. The staff is really cool, its just too expensive! Especially for Mexican!

Professional body piercing. That is an important phrase people. Body piercers who are first aid certified, cpr trained and could essentially work in a doctors office. Because these people are putting things under your skin, its important that they know what they are doing!  The staff at HTC knows what they are doing. It is one of the most comfortable shops to get piercings done I have ever been. They have awesome jewelry and an awesome ability to explain what goes into a piercing and how the body will react to the damage being done.   They do not do tattoos, or use piercing guns, or sell t-shirts, bongs, or any of a hundred other things that I have seen in other grimy piercing places. This place rocks!

North Mountain? Where is that?   Its north of the rest of them!   Camelback gets all the press, South Mountain has the trails. North Mountain however has a visitor center! Seriously, its visitor center makes Camelback's port-a-potty look as ghetto as it is. It also has ample parking, take that Camelback you overrated Snottsdale bitch!  North Mountain is really one of the nicest hikes I have done without leaving the valley. Its a great 2-3 hour hike that gets blood pumping, has some cool history and some excellent views.   There are a few peaks to hit, some steep and challenging, some easy and beautiful. Along the way there are the ruins of an old restaurant that looks as though it'd have been a sweet hangout at one point, when horseback was a way to travel.   As we got to the very top, there was a bearded old man with a headband meditating...we backed off to give him is peace. I belated realized that when you encounter the old man of the mountain you get to ask a question...ah well, he seemed pretty stoked that we didn't disturb him!

This is the Honey Bear's no one knows. Its amazing that the staple of downtown Phoenix cuisine is so obscure here in what is essentially the heart of the sprawl that is Tempe/Chandler/Ahwautukee (Phoenix).  Nonetheless, Honey Bears still comes through, with some of the tastiest BBQ sauce I've ever had and a super tasty selection of meats with fries...so good!  The chicken cup is ridiculously good, it was my first intro to HB and I still don't know what its supposed to be called, its a cup of chicken with BBQ sauce! The sausages are perfect here!   If you are passing by or live near here, check it out!

This is a great little stop for coffee and some pastry. They have brunch as well, I have never been for brunch but will definitely try it some time.   Right across from the Light Rail, its hard to be more convenient! Its also a quick walk across Deck Park to the Phoenix Public Library - Burton Barr Branch...nice to get a book and then have a coffee while reading it!  They have live jazz at times and support many excellent local causes as well as being guaranteed fair trade certified!

This place is all right. They have an excellent set up for NFL football on Sundays during the season. TVs everywhere and a crowd that is mixed enough that everyone is rooting with someone (or against them). They do a breakfast buffet that is really good and pretty reasonable.   They have a card program where you get stamps for consecutive weeks of attendance during the season. It was pretty cool the first time, the second time I had to argue with the manager for my final reward ($25 gift card) and he jipped me on $5. That left a bad taste in my mouth...  Other than NFL Sundays the bar is just kind of tolerable. You must be able to handle the really young crowd getting sick and into fights. If you have any experience at bars you will probably find it annoying.

This was an alright movie theater. It had the requisite accoutrements of a theater. Just in Mesa and at Riverview which sucks. They seen to have recently remodeled to have 'luxury recliners' that not only require that you pick your seats when you buy tickets (without any guarantees that someone isn't already in the seats) but also the seats are horribly uncomfortable whether reclined or upright. I now hate this theater...

Have you ever had a Huachitlacoya? I had not either. Luckily, I long ago adopted the method of ordering Mexican food that went:  I don't know what that is. Let me have one of those, please!  So happy that I adopted that method!  Also so happy that I found Huachinanga, it is by far the best Mexican food that I've experienced in the valley. GO!  They are also one of the only places that has Habanero Salsa that is hot, but does not make you want to spit out your food. Go easy on it, it is habanero, but it is so good!

This place really is an excellent spot for doggie day care, washing your dog, or for quality dog food and treats.  Even better? Its full of people that are excited to meet your dog. I have never seen a staff member unhappy. Every time I come in with my dog they greet him by name. Its really kinda cool to go to a place with happy dogs and people!   The tubs raise and lower! That makes it so much easier to wash your dog! Its pretty awesome. Not the best location in the world, as far as dodging the homeless or trying to get home between 4 and 6 (stupid 7th Ave!). Nonetheless, we are going to try to use them as much as possible even though we are moving away from the area!

I went to eat here once...wasn't super impressed with the place or the cheesesteak, I have never been to Philly to have one, but this wasn't great. The meat is kinda bland and stringy and the bread was OK.  These guys show up at my job every once in a while to give out free samples. They should probably think that through though...their samples aren't very good.  I did see a porn video that was shot with them in the background once though. (It was an 'on-the-street flashing' video.

My family calls it "The place with the face" because Viva Michoacan is tricky to say and there is a giant picture of a guy's face on the marquee.   I have to say I am impressed that it is one of my family's favorite places to go! It is authentic Mexican. The food is phenomenal, I have had the Goat Leg soup as well as Chimichangas and a lot in between. Never had a bad time. They make the guacamole at the table and explain the process to you. I have never been here without a large group and they are always excellent, never messed up an order!   Margaritas are strong and the Negro Modelo is cold. If you are in Henderson (Vegas' Tempe) or Vegas go and get the food here! You will not be disappointed!

So apparently, some of the staff that was at the Mill store moved to the Hardy store. This happened at the same time that the Hardy store was on my way to work, as opposed to the Mill store.   I am not sure if it was the staff move or this store has always been this way. This place is better than the Mill store though. My breakfast wrap is tastier, larger, and  better put together than what I have had at the Mill store since the staff change.   Both stores are excellent, not to disparage the Mill store. They still have excellent ingredients and make amazing sandwiches.   I just feel that the Hardy store makes a breakfast wrap that is closer to what I want than any other place I have been.  This is still one of the best hangover cures you can have!

Had a great time here with the family grandparents down to niece. Of course there is a line if you go when you want to...so there is that.  I have experienced a steady decline in their food quality of late. Its been annoying. Especially since there hasn't really been a change in how busy they are.   Its a kitschy place and it will always have a crowd. I probably wont be part of it any longer but would go there if its a destination for a group.

Fast, good, and clean. Unless you are in just after the high school kids get through, which is impossible to defeat, this is a great little Mexican food stand style place. Finally a place has embraced the gringo breakfast burrito (bacon, potato, egg and cheese) and named it, New Breakfast Burrito.   If you are in the area and hungry, worth a trip!

I went here once and then went back to try it again. After entering and observing, I realized that this was going to be the same exact underwhelming experience as the first time. As a matter of fact, they are pretty much a factory of that exact experience. Kind of annoying.   The food was salty. Really salty. I've had so much better Mexican...I don't understand this place being successful here. I can only imagine that it is because we have so many transplants here in AZ and they have trouble trying places they don't recognize the name of.   Its OK people. There are real Mexican's here who have been making food for years! Go to one of your local places, check it out. It will destroy this corporate blandness that has salt as its only spice.  You are on Yelp, you could look for a place near you! A Mexican place that only exists here in your town! Has no other locations 2500 miles away from Mexico. Its OK to adventure out of what you know! Its actually why some of us are Yelping, so you can go to the places that are good, not the ones that suck.

This is the coolest little boutique! The staff here are super cool, friendly and very helpful!   When I was looking for no show underwear for a Halloween costume (Lt Dangle - Reno 911) the guy working there had me try on a number of types! More than I wanted too even!  Furthermore, if you are looking for a card for a friend, they have a collection of the greatest greeting cards ever!   Awesome!

This is a cool little place. Very pricey, food is largely OK pricey as hell though! I have been there 3 times. Brunch was excellent, but very expensive for an omelet (between $8 and $12 dollars)! Next was $3 burger Monday. It is difficult to be disappointed in a three dollar burger. It wasn't that good though. The next time I went there I just got a beer.   This place apparently has an awesome drink selection. I don't really know or care. I am a beer drinker. I enjoy beer and know quite a bit about it. For example: Pouring beer into a glass is part of the process of preparing beer for drinking. Quality beers are meant to pass through the air and build up a head. It allows the taste of the beer to come to the forefront. Furthermore, a frosty glass destroys beer. Y'know those ice chunks that appear in the beer? That is the water that is in the beer and it should not turn to ice!  To get back to Maize's two out of the three servers had no idea what the beers were on the menu. I did not ask the third as I had to work and was not drinking that visit. Even more ridiculous, they have a He'brew beer listed. That is fine except He'brew is a brewery with a least 7 beers currently produced. Its like they put Anheiser-Busch on the list, as a beer. They bring the beer in a bottle, if you ask for a glass it will come frosted. I asked for an unfrosted glass and was told that they don't have any. That is ridiculous. Run a glass under warm water for 20 seconds et voila, it is no longer frosted. I would expect this from a place that did not have craft beers on their list. A place that does have them...c'mon. Why not just have Bud/Miller/Coors?  Pricey food that is only OK and servers that don't know their menu don't add up to an experience that I want to repeat any time soon. If you invite me I'll go, but expect me to give them shit about beers!

I am not impressed with this place, my original review makes this clear. However, the fact that they were closed on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend makes them useless in my book. I was bringing two friends who had never been there, and still haven't because they were closed.  Businesses up and down Central Ave were busy, especially Hula's. They could have gotten the overflow from Hula's but they were closed at 7:30 on a Sunday night.

Y'know what? I usually try to go to a place a number of times before reviewing it. I was only here once an NEVER WANT TO GO BACK. It's just awful corporate "Irish" BS! Their burger (Mushroom Swiss I believe) was $14! So much I remarked to my friend how excited I was to try this ridiculously priced burger...it was moderately OK.   They had a Tullamore Dew mirror but no Tullamore on the menu (Tullamore Dew is an Irish Whiskey), going back to the place being "Irish." I asked the manager about the whiskey and he had no idea what I was talking about.  The best part! They had a beer menu with domestics and imports. Imports were $1.50 more and Fat Tire was listed on there as a Belgian import. Now it is from New Belgium Brewing, which is located in that far of land of Colorado! Again, asked the manager about that, he had no idea what I was talking about.

This place was Ok to bad. We had a groupon for the experience and the guy at the counter explained that the groupon did not pay for taxes so we'd have to pay the $3.36 to cover the expense.  Seriously? Two brand new customers just walked in and you are going to charge them pittance for taking advantage of an offer that you agreed to? We will be contacting Groupon about that, it seemed rather chinsy to me.   Then there was the belay class, which apparently costs $5. We have climbed before at Phoenix Rock Gym, and they give an instructional video and then personalized instruction in belaying at no extra charge...what is the deal here?   We did not take the class, as the guy at the counter let us know that he could just give us brush up on belaying for free, thankfully.  The routes here are nice, I enjoyed the various levels of difficulty and the well marked routes. However, there were a number of routes that were set on the wall but the top rope for them was not available, if you aren't sure what that means its the rope that allows you to climb the route without falling to your death.  I was not impressed with the ropes, I even bypassed some routes because the ropes were really frayed and I am not sure they were still viable if I fell. Climbing rope is dynamic rope that does have a lifespan (number of falls, or stretching) after that, it is no longer lifesaving rope. A lot of the ropes here did not look good. I noticed that a few of the climbers that looked to be regular climbers, they had a bit of gear that was not rented, also had their own rope. Perhaps that is their solution to the rope issue?  I was not impressed, I believe I will continue on a Phoenix Rock Gym. I hope nobody dies because this place has old rope. Perhaps that is why they were charging extra on a groupon? Also it was really hot in there...sure its summer in PHX but, c'mon turn the AC up, people are being active! The chinsy-ness did not end at the reception desk...

Quick, easy, and good! Hot Dogs shouldn't be too complicated, this place makes them that way. You can choose from a nice spread of toppings, some grilled (bacon, red peppers) some cold (pickle, pepperoncinis) and add sauces at will. They have 5 basic dogs, 4 Peaks Beer Brat, Andouille, Polish, Vienna Beef, Skinny (and Veggie).   Getting in and out is quick, the staff is friendly and talkative. You can grab a beer there if you like as well as any number of convenience store items (condoms and whatnot).   Great stop on the way to work, a show, or drinking around town. Cheapest meal you can get on Mill!

We got to use SHPR when we got a groupon for a two night stay. We took a tour of the place and ended up using it for our dog, Buster, to stay at when we moved. BTW it is much easier to move when your dog is staying elsewhere!  They have a great doggie day-care set up, outdoor and indoor facilities. They really pay attention to detail. All of the staff were nice and seemed to really love animals.   We got to see the Saint Bernard's that they house and care for as a rescue facility. They are available for adoption, but I can't wrap my head around having a dog that big!  When we got Buster back from SHPR he was as happy and healthy as when he went in. We would use them again if they were closer to us, and a little less costly.

Hanny's is rather exceptional. It feels like you are drinking in a department store at night. Which is fun.  I've had two experiences here and enjoyed both. Great drinks, great food and very interesting decor. Still haven't gotten into the expensive drinks, but I want to!  The bathrooms are awesome and disorienting, and the elevator shaft is a unique part of what is essentially a dinner club. Clientele varies according to events in downtown phoenix but locals are usually hipsters or scenesters. Fun place!

This Mc Donalds is no better than any of the other  Mc Donalds that are out there.

OMG! This place is awesome. Best turkey sausage I've ever had. Hands down. Ever!  Went here after hiking North Mountain. Love the style, love the decor, the service is actually great. It may not seem that way at first as you order at the counter and they give you a placard to place at your table. You get your own drinks, silverware and condiments. They have a lot of condiments!   Server brings your order to you after you sit, you enjoy your meal. We bussed our own table and then left. Others left their trash because they were Scottsdale 30K millionaires who think the world is there to clean up after them. The place is full of nasty rich types but that's not the staff's fault.  Please leave a tip as the four tables of proper ladies I watched left the poor server nothing (again the world is there for their pleasure).  Dog-friendly too!

Local Breeze is a sweet place! Somehow actually has is breezy in downtown phoenix as well! They have great food, excellent breakfast, good drinks and beer and a huge outdoor patio.   This really is a great little gem just outside of the heart of downtown PHX. A short walk from the madness of the downtown 'scene' in a nice little neighborhood that people actually live in! Its cool.  Also bring your bike and you get a discount!

This place is so cool. Its kooky and nutty. Even better, it has a nice bathroom (convenient when you are up here on Saturday for the Short Leash, Stinkweeds, Hula Hoop extravaganza).   Got my mom Skybars here, btw: Skybars suck ass!  So much cool candy and kitschy stuff!

So this is a brewery. They have an IPA on the menu, listed at 17 IBUs. I am not sure how much you know about beer, and the IBU (Bitterness basically) is a BS measurement unit anyway, IPAs usually have around a 50-60 though. It was great that the waitress understood what we meant when we asked if that was correct, she at least knew what we were talking about. Nonetheless, the beer sampler was well priced, even if the beer wasn't very good.   The food was unremarkeable, other than the sausage sampler which was excellent. My friend had Mac n Cheese, a passion of hers, and was basically unhappy with it; it was essentially velveeta.  Staff was really cool, bartender gave out free shots when the Suns won, even gave an Arizona Snowman to our DD (shot of cold water!). Unfortunately a great staff cannot save a mediocre brewery with little to offer in ambience or food.

This place is sweet. They are not big on china, glassware or silverware. They use recycled products plates, plastic-ware and drinks in the container they come in (ie a coke in a coke can). The ambiance is awesome. Sweet and funny signs everywhere, reading material, classic rock playing. They only have the radio on but there always seem to be great songs on! They have a large patio out back that is difficult to see from the front but is really nice on a sunny morning.   I haven't gotten past the breakfast bowls yet. $6 for 6 toppings, potatoes, buttered toast, and jam. Go ahead and eat carnivore, omnivore or herbivore style (not sure if there are vegan options). Seriously, this $6 breakfast bowl would be $12 at other places served on fine china and with silverware! I don't care about accoutrements like that. Especially when the food is so tasty.  The location, midway point of the Melrose District, is stellar. You can spend hours walking up and down looking at retro shops and cool little places. Two Hippies sets a perfect tone for hanging out on 7th Ave!

Not only is this a McDonald's so therefore nigh on inedible, but its a bad McDonalds! I have never had food from here that tasted good at all!  Two pet peeves: They have no bike rack. Y'know how Mickey D's is all, "We are for the active American now, come get yer carrot sticks!" Well, why don't you have a bike rack? Especially in one of the highest bike population densities in the country? Burger King down the block has 'em!  The other: They have done away with small drinks. The smallest is medium now. THE SMALLEST DRINK IS A MEDIUM. Even better? They still have lids labeled for smalls!

The Coronado Coney.  It is one of the greatest things on a menu! Get it on Saturday when you can get Vegan Chili on top, after all what is better to do with vegan chili than to put it on a giant hot dog?  The dog is gigantic as well, I have brought the other half of it home as left overs, that is a first for a hot dog. Of course it is a Shreiner's sausage so that's a good thing  The beer selection is excellent and well priced. They have a great number of AZ brews on tap and in bottle and a good amount of knowledge about them.   Get the side of fresh greens, it'll make you feel way better about eating that giant hot dog and the other choice is potato chips anyway...

This little Phoenix gem delivers everything you want from fine Mexican dining without all the touristy bullshit. The exterior has classic Dia De Las Muertas tile work and the interior is rustic, intimate and clean. The menus and prices are simple and excellent and the food is phenomenal.  The salsa bar is one of the best I have ever experienced. At least 12 different salsas. All different and all excellent, and I believe, made on the premises. We had, Pecan, Peanut Butter, 7 Chili, Mexicano, Pico de Gallo, and Cilantro salsa. If variety is the spice of life, what is a variety of spices?  The absolute, takes the cake reason for 5 stars is the Horchata! I am a fan of Horchata. I have never had Horchata like this! 32 ounces with what must have been muddled strawberries and apples and fresh ground cinnamon. So good, so good.

Ha! Only in Scottsdale could this pass as pizza.   The bruschetta was salty and soggy. The pizza was barely edible. The menu had misspellings on it...the prices were outrageous. I'll take Tessio's any day!

This place is such a beautiful breath of fresh air in the middle of downtown phoenix. Nice comfy couches and a great welcoming space.  I got there after an awful drive (my rearview mirror had fallen off the windshield shield I was at work) on the 17 post an 8 hour shift. I had an appt for a massage though and it seemed like a perfect time to get one! I saw Trankie, the owner and masseuse, after I came in and he greeted me with a big hug and told me he'd be ready on time for the massage.   I've had a few massages and mostly been disappointed. I always feel like the masseuse isn't forceful enough, or just plain hurts me. Trankie was amazing! got me very relaxed and gave me a massage that I think about two weeks later (sorry about the late review!). Definitely recommend going and getting worked on!  Furthermore, the salon did a benefit for the Grow-Op Co-Op. A local garden coop/store where you can buy crafts from artists. I thought that was a very cool thing as supporting the local community is something that really helps everyone.

I really would like to use this boarding place that is not too far off from me, also the bathing services would be nice. However the hours of operation are just not useful for people who have jobs. I called and asked if they were strict about the 5pm closing time and was told they were (many places, including Scottsdale Pet Hotel, Wiggles and Wags, and Smelly Dog are not).   I cannot wrap my head around how I am supposed to drop my dog off and pick my dog up during the time that I am actually at work. The other places I deal with either will work with you or are open 7am to 7pm (y'know, reasonable times to drop off and pick up your pet on the way too/from work).  I had hoped that perhaps the hours would expand in time, however they have not...oh well. Maybe some day the timing of this place will make sense.

Short Leash does it right. Shreiner's Fine Sausages, Flatbread buns, excellent ingredients and Faygo!   It is hard to dislike hot dogs, unless your vegetarian, or don't eat certain meats, or are into eating healthy...etc.  Short Leash defeats these issues one by one, their dogs can be healthy if you want, with fruits and veggies. They can even be vegetarian! (I am not sure about vegan, but probably) Furthermore, they can be chicken, beef, spicy beer, brat or hot dog. Moreover, they are served on flatbread! Flatbread! These guys improved on the hot dog bun!  Even better, they are served out of a truck in various places around town, but only at that place at that time. I often get them at the Downtown Public Market on Wednesdays, however I have heard they are at Central and Camelback on Saturdays often as well.   I have also heard rumor of them having breakfast dogs as well!  They even do private events, like weddings...that'd be freakin awesome!

I had been to Bliss a number of times for brunch, the experience was excellent. However, when I went there for dinner that was the kicker! This place is awesome!  Sriracha Aioli, I was thinking of ordering more stuff just to try dipping it in there! We also got a Tomato Ragout and Honey Ginger sauce, those came with the appetizers (Fried Sausage Ravioli and Coconut Chicken Tenders). They have an entire list of dipping sauces that I cannot wait to try!  Dessert was an Ice Cream Sandwich! Honestly, I don't even know how the regular menu is. We couldn't decide on an entree, everything looked too good (Mac n Cheese Loaded w Chicken & Bacon!) so we settled on appetizers and desert.   It was amazing! Go and eat!  (I have no idea how Rebar is, I wrote on their Facebook wall about their beer selection and got the answer: If you want good beer go to Roosevelt or Lost Leaf...so I do)

I can't believe I am updating my review for Bliss/ReBar with a negative experience. The server/bartender (which I think was the problem, bartenders have so much to do that waiting on 16 or so people can get tricky) was initially very responsive to our table of 7, he got drink orders, food orders and then double checked with us on the food order. However as his section filled up, his service declined. He could have handled it better, but I think this one largely weighs as a management problem. This was the day of the Phoenix AIDS Walk, we beat the rush at Bliss, but they got busy quick! Why was the bartender also serving 16 or so people? A server, or the manager should have taken over the section.  Specific issues:   I got the Bliss Scramble, which I could swear I had before and it was great, this time it was essentially a Denny's chorizo omelet at twice the price. The 'toast' was something that Elwood would have enjoyed (re: dry, white, bread), the scramble was a flattened conglomeration of cheese, chorizo and egg (the menu said veggies too, but I couldn't find them) on top of hash browns that were nothing special.  My girlfriend got the Eggs Benedict, I quote: "The worst Eggs Benedict I have ever had!" It was supposed to be served on pretzel bread. The bread it was served on looked like it would be perfect for bruschetta. One of our friends got the french toast, which is also 'sliced pretzel bread' according to the menu. However, that was obviously pretzel bread, I had some, it was delicious. I didn't even feel inclined to try my girlfriend's poor little bruschetta breads sitting under their hood of egg and hollandaise. When Matt S, the bartender/server, came by with another round of food, we asked him why the meal was not as described, he said it was, that was the pretzel bread. Even though we had an example of pretzel bread sitting on the table. A helpful guy who'd only been there a week, went to check with the kitchen for us and came back to let us know that pretzel bread and pretzel buns were different. We thanked him for that info, as another friend had a pretzel bun sitting on her plate and yes it was different from the pretzel bread that was made into french toast, and it was quite different from the sad little slices that were looking for light under their egg roof. The amount of egg on the Benedict was startlingly small as well, especially for a place that I usually feel has over-sized portions, everyone's portions (including my homely omelet) were superior to the Benedict. Which means that yes, the bread was even smaller than the small serving of eggs.  Matt was also wrong about two eggs that he brought us, he stood there at the table with them asking who ordered them, we said no one and he put them down and left.  My scramble came well after everyone else had started eating, perhaps a reason it was so blah? I added one of the mystery eggs  to my scramble to make it at least somewhat interesting. Never, not once did Matt ask us if we needed ketchup, sriracha or anything like that. The few times he swooped by, it seemed he was trying to not make eye contact. (Probably because of the non-pretzel bread).  We received a bill with errors and a few unhappy looks. Then we headed out to continue our day wondering if we should get some more, and better food at Squash Blossom next time...  I am sorely disappointed in Bliss' brunch this day, and saddened by this, I used to be able to recommend this place without reservations as an excellent brunch and dinner venue (I have never been for lunch). Now, if asked where to go...I'd probably have to say The Welcome Diner, Squash Blossom, or Denny's if you want a chorizo omelet, dry toast, and hash browns.

I've been here a number of times. I just keep giving it another chance to impress. It really hasn't though. The dogs are OK, just nothing special. Prices aren't too bad, but they don't really Do that much.   I used a coupon deal once, called in my order and let them know. Those hot dogs were worse than Circle K dogs. To be fair I did get delayed going to pick them up...they served them to me though.  I was excited to see that they had breakfast burritos as well, then annoyed to read that if you did not get them exactly as specified on the menu they would add a quarter. That implies they are pre-made. Why else charge for removing items, like jalapeños (specifically noted on the menu as costing $.25 to remove).  I'll probably break down and buy a burrito one day, perhaps the chef is an artist who is simply insulted at changes to the masterpiece that the burrito is!

There I was. IN AJ, I did not expect it...but here is a place with great beer! Awesome.  Actually I did expect it. A couple of friends told me I should check it out if I headed out in that direction. We hiked the Peralta Trail in the Superstition Wilderness and then found the place a little distance away.   From the outside, I was unsure. It looks like many other places seen from the road in AJ, like it might be open...  Inside it is a nice spot! Well crafted bar with craft beer promotional schwag in full abundance. A cooler full of excellent beer selections, a chalkboard beer list and menu. Nice setup!  The draft selection is phenomenal! I was blown away at some of the choices. I settled on the Rye Wine from Four Peaks, a buddy had the Lagunitas Pils, and Sarah had the Crispin cider (which they did pour on ice without having to be told to!).   The burgers were excellent, the brussel sprouts were awesome! Crustini's are a cool little item, especially if there is a vegetarian in your group!  The only downfall was that there was no chicken on the menu. Apparently they are trying to stay local, grass fed and organic. But no chicken is rough!   We asked about wine, and were told there was wine...but never saw a wine list. Whatever, this place is sweet! It will be a regular stop when hitting the Superstitions!

This place is upgraded to five stars! They are just so damn cool!   Now having regular events with DJs and dancers as well as movies you could never see anywhere (George Miele's From the Earth to the Moon? Saw it! It rocked).  Go here, AMC is no fun anyway!

With great fanfare The Station on Central took over the property formerly known as Empirian on Central. The property had been owned by the bank (Wells Fargo) since before we signed our lease and had basically used that as an excuse to not do anything, like fix the roof that leaks or the gates that are broken...etc. Well, thankfully Baron Properties came in, bought the place and promised change!  Well, they did change the office staff and the maintenance staff. I would be hard pressed to tell what effect the change in the office staff had as the new staff is pretty much as reliable as the old staff. As in, they tell you they will get things done and then ignore them completely. Almost two months in there has still been no fixing of the roofs or gates. Although it was promised that both were "top priority."   What else has changed? The colors of one of the south facing buildings. Apparently they are going from gray and blue to very dark brown and pea soup. That's a smart move here in the valley! Where temps reach the hundred teens. The cooling grays and blues were kind of nice. They also planted flowers, changed the locks on the gates that worked (near the office), and replaced the fence around the pool.   It is really a pleasure to see this work going on. Especially when you know that your roof has 4 leaks in it and it is just a matter of time until it rains again. even better that the leaking has been going on for 10 months so the black mold is just building! Its even nicer to see the superficial improvements when the dishwasher you informed the office about upon them taking over still hasn't been fixed (47 days later).  Then there is the trash (which is piled up by residents over the weekend because no one comes by to clear the chute) and the lack of recycling (the old management claimed that they tried it but residents were unable to comply [see above about the trash pileup, I'm pretty sure residents were using any available container instead of piling trash in public space]).   This place is not the worst place I have ever lived but it certainly has caused the most headaches. (Tempe Rentals takes the cake as the absolute worst).

Get over the girls in kilts already. Didn't Hooters already bark this tree out? Whatever, food is good, but not worth that price! The atmosphere is sophomoric and annoying. If you are some kind of douchebag go here so I don't have to be annoyed with you somewhere that I am.

What a sweet little place! It really is beautiful, large outdoor patio. The interior has a giant roll up door that allows you to sit outside, while being inside. Decor is awesome, classy and makes you want to sit and spend some time.   Timo is a nice ride up Central from the light rail stop at Camelback and Central. Up the bridal trail and just past the canal (about 5 miles of nice riding). Which is awesome because they have a phenomenal wine list, excellent beer selection and some kick ass non-acoholic drinks!  They have a wood fired oven which they use to make their own bread, and toast the sandwiches (if you think this is similar to what Quiznos does...I am speechless...please stop reading.). The bread is delightful and the sandwiches will last two meals! Appetizer menu is absolutely delectable, so many things I couldn't decide. Went with a simple olive tampenade, it was stellar!  The menu is surprisingly affordable considering the ingredients, quality and decor. If this place were 10 miles east it'd be double the price! Not that I want the prices to go up, I was delighted.  Run, bike, walk, drive, if you must,...go and check it out.

Finally got here for Brunch, which negates none of my previous review, in fact it solidifies it!  This brunch is phenomenal! From the Mimosa Flight to the Egg-White Frittata to the gigantic sausage patty on the sausage and egg sandwich...just excellently done!  Dogs are allowed, so bring your pup. Expect to see dusty people having hiked North Mountain as well as hungover hipsters et al.   Timo is so good that we left athletic gear there and they got in touch and got it back to us! This place is awesome!!!!! Go!!!

So, this used to be Dave's Electric Brewpub. It was OK at that time. Now that it has changed hands...again, so many times...  Whatever, taken on its own merits, this place sucks. Plastic cups, plastic utensils...but not a discount price. $6 for a crappy breakfast burrito. I have had better burritos from a frozen wrapper. They were out of most of the drinks, champagne for mimosas, most of the beers. I see the end looming.  I wonder what crappy place is going to be here next.

The store is very cool. Great customer service, they will do the best to get you what you need. The dog wash is awesome, hydraulic tubs with actual assistance from the owners, who have washed more dogs than anyone. They will clip nails for a little extra, and they get the nails without breaking your dogs limbs.  The groomers are the best, they have such a devoted following

Excellent repair job. This guys work out of his house. Basically you drop it off, he calls you in a few days to let you know what is wrong. You pick up and pay him, super easy. Old school lawnmower repair. I called him about a weed trimmer too, he will not work on the four stroke models because they are too complex. I haven't needed my lawnmower repaired since though.

My wife and I have been here for brunch a few times. I have rarely seen more evidence of mismanagement. Today it took over an hour, from ordering, for five people to get brunch. I have never been a stickler for quick service, good food takes time and busy kitchens are busy.   Our food showed obvious signs of having sat under a heat lamp for too long. Eggs that were just overcooked, cheese that was just a little too melted. Even better when the over-easy eggs that were solid got sent back, the place ran out of eggs.   One more time, just in case, the place ran out of eggs! During Sunday brunch. When they said earlier they they were sending someone to buy OJ for the mimosa we ordered we laughed and said, "OK!"   They ran out of orange juice and eggs during Sunday brunch. We saw the employee running up after fetching the eggs, very legit...he bought a dozen (they still had two hours or so of brunch left).   The guy who was apparently the manager, came over during the egg debacle and said they'd comp drinks and  the messed up egg meal and offered us a free breakfast coupon for later use. Apparently, they had a big wedding the night before and that messed up Sunday brunch.   After we got our checks, he did comp the messed up meal and some drinks. He also gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. No return coupon for breakfast. No big deal, we won't be returning for breakfast or at all.  He then shot my wife a dirty look as we left...cause y'know we were unreasonable customers wanting food to eat and competent management.

These guys can't seem to get their shit together. Drive through is slowest ever. Waiting inside is better, then you just have to wait for the food, which I think is pretty good and is cooked on site.  They are an example of why minimum wage should be raised  The employees here could give a shit, and why should they?  I was going to get a breakfast sandwich, but they have lettuce and tomato on them? That makes no sense, and makes me think that whoever put the menu together hasn't had a breakfast sandwich. They have a 12oz soda on the menu, I was told it was 16oz and then handed a 12oz cup of soda. When I pointed it out the employee said, "it says 16 on our thing" and shrugged. Again, why should she actually care?  Not sure why Wendy's that used to be here went down, but this place better get a little more involved in its own success or there won't be any...

Apparently this 'pizza place' doesn't serve slices of pizza. I will never understand that concept. Cleanliness was OK, a little better than when this was Roma Pizza, but they served slices. So this is worse.

This is an amazing little shop on 22nd St and McDowell. I found out about it from a Polish man who was searching for ingredients to make Polish moonshine. We were discussing the paucity of delicatessens here in the desert (a theme that transits my reviews) and he mentioned that this place was everything you wanted out of a deli. He was correct.  Much like the best delicatessens, the food is ethnic. Eastern European sausage is their specialty. You can get other stuff, and it is also good. However their selection of handmade Eastern European sausage is absolutely phenomenal.   The woman behind the counter is also terrific! You get the sense that she would rap you on the head with a spoon if she could get away with it. My first time in, I was reading the menu, she walked up and asked, "What you want?" in a heavy (likely Polish) accent. When I hesitated, she exclaimed, "C'mon, what are you hungry for?" Don't let the gruffness fool you, she is only bringing home the point that we spend too much time at places like Subway ordering their "meals" than thinking about what we'd like to eat.  I go two hot dogs that first time, they were absolutely amazing. I mean they were hot dogs, just amazing hot dogs. Since then I have also tried the polish sausage, a turkey sandwich (just a bite) and the pierogies...OMG the pierogies!   --why is it that any place that makes pierogies only sells them by the dozen? they are soooo heavy!!!--  Also there is an amazing selection of Eastern European groceries, everyting from jams and jellies to Kosciusko mustard and candy bars. I don't think there is another spot in the valley that has some of this stuff!  This place is a must hit here in the valley. People who care about the food they serve you, and enough character to write a novel about. Go and check them  out, you might find out about a sweet concert coming up from a Polish pop band as well!

So glad this little spot opened. Was riding by and saw that it was actually here, I happened to be looking for breakfast! Its very cool use of space, I think it might be difficult with a large group. Panini sandwich is an excellent way to do breakfasts...but ketchup is a good thing to have on hand if you make breakfast. It has a long shelf life and people tend to put it on breakfast. Cool spot, bike rack right outside.

This overpriced cafeteria really needs to figure itself out. It seems like a great bar but there is no concept for the restaurant. When you finally figure out what's going on you realize you have your food but forgot to grab silverware, napkins, ketchup...etc. Again, cafeteria style. Except you'll spend less at a restaurant and get actual plates and utensils.  Its got niftyness...just not value.

Wow. This place truly lives up to not being much of anything. From the 'rough carved' sasquatch family in front to the decidedly not family atmosphere inside it manages to be spacious but yet cramped. Games area outside is right next to an area that would probably be a great stage for live music but is overtaken by a lounge? Or maybe just an uncomfortable seating area? The food is mediocre but expensive. I had iceberg lettuce on a $12 burger that tasted like neither habanero nor parmesan! The green chili pork was bland (my mom would probably think it was spicy, but this is occupied Mexico).   The 'craft' beer menu is about as pedestrian as you can get with nothing truly interesting. Which doesn't matter because a frozen beer glass freezes the water in your beer anyway, why even have quality beer if you are going to destroy it before it even gets to me?  The 'lodge tea' is large (16oz) but tastes too much like the flavoring in flavored vodka, very chemical flavor. Not sure if the wood smell is piped in or what but the place smells like treated lumber. Music was just awful...bro-country mixed with contemporary pop bs. The huge tvs make everything seem even more cramped and it is impossible to hear the people sitting next to you.
