Love eating here!  We grew up in the suburbs of Detroit and miss our Hani's from National.  We've been waiting a long time for someone to come out here and open a restaurant like this!  Excellent service and good food, what more can you ask for!  Hope to see them closer to my home in Chandler/Gilbert in the future!  Now all we need to do is find a good pizza place to replace Buddy's/Loui'.

They hired a DJ for Halloween night when a groups of Friends and I were there.  Note that the demographic in the bar was mostly 35+ and after multiple request for songs that fit our demographic and several tips he refused to play older songs and half the bar cleared out and no one was dancing per the managers request!  Do they think this is Tempe?  We don't want to party to Justin briber sorry :(

Jeremy and his team were awesome at getting our loan done and ontime just as they promised! They always explained every step in detail with me and my husband and what to expect next!  I felt like they really cared about us and we weren't just a number. I highly recommend Jeremy House the House Team to all our friends and family!

We always go to the williams field location. So happy the new one is closer to home!  The blacken chicken alfredo is to die for!  Who needs Olive Garden when we have Blue 32.
