Any restaurant that proudly displays 'American Fries' and 'All-American Toast' as a substitution for 'French Fries' and 'French Toast' are just mindless and a bit moronic. I asked our server about what I perceived as a type-o. She grinned her best 3 tooth grin and kindly answered  "It's cause we don't like those French for not supporting us in Iraq." Uh. Ok.    If you want a good meal, and not feel like your IQ dropped 15 points for reading the menu, I suggest not going to Scott's Generations.

I am staying at the Tapatio Cliffs Resort right now and my car was spray painted last night. All the windows and profanity on the back. After talking with several people, a manager, security, etc., the only thing I was told (in paraphrase) was 'we can't do anything, but an insurance claim has been made', and that these things happen.. Not anything to compensate, to make me feel secure that this won't happen again, nothing. I am being treated like some idiot who is paying money to be here for several days and that's it. If you want to make sure you are secure and want a staff that works hard to make sure you are satisfied, I suggest not staying here. They are horrible and have done absolutely nothing. This is not the Hilton brand standard and I am appalled as a paying customer I am being treated this way. DO NOT STAY HERE.

I hope this resort is better than their sister property.  I am staying at the Tapatio Cliffs Resort right now and my car was spray painted last night. All the windows and profanity on the back.

I have been coming to Thai E-San for years and it's probably the best Thai I've had in Phoenix. Service is great, always greeted warmly and promptly. Food is super tasty and great portions for great prices. I would highly recommend coming here to anyone looking for a good meal (and a joke or two from Rex -- just ask for one, you won't be sorry!)

Great place! Went there for the first time last week and was impressed by the selection of teas. Holly was friendly and extremely helpful. If you like tea, I suggest checking out Fleur de Teas.
