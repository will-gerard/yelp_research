My wife and I purchased a Groupon for a haircut, mani, pedi and facial. First off...the place is depressing....it reminded us of a laundromat, and the room smelled like dirty diapers.The students look depressed, 85% of them were just sitting around doing nothing or looking into their phones. The first thing I said to my wife was, "we have to be here for 2 HOURS?!?!"  Aside the aesthetics of the establishment, the first thing that irritated me was that they separated me from my wife into opposite sides of the room. The student I was assigned was an overweight Asian woman who literally spoke NO English....so she didn't say 2 words to me the entire time I was getting my haircut, and the only way I could communicate with my wife was via text message.  Towards the end of my haircut, my wife texted me and asked how things were going. I asked her if we were going to have the same student for the rest of our treatments. She said yes, but we could switch if it was a problem. I merely texted her back that it would be nice if I had someone I could chat with. She said she would handle it, since she had met and become friendly with the school's lead instructor.   Well, apparently this cause a HUGE problem, as the owner's daughter very sternly expressed that my request had now caused an issue and I supposedly "insulted" the student, and how I need to realize this is a school....and on and on. I simply stood up, looked at her and said "nevermind...I don't want the rest of the services if its inconveniencing you that much.", and I walked out.   Bottom line....I wouldn't go back there if they were offering FREE services!!

Never received worst customer service in my life! From the phony friendly tellers to Chalise Jacobs, the Branch Manager, it was the worst banking experience of my life! I will never bank with Wells Fargo and I will avoid the downtown branch at all costs!

I have visited this store many times looking for just the right piece for my loft. When ready to make a purchase, I found a dining table and chair set that I very much liked and thought would fit nicely with my decor. The table was marked at $2,100.00 but the chairs had no price tags. I asked to speak to the owner so as to negotiate a price for the entire set and was asked to wait, as he was on his way in. I waited for 20 minutes, when he finally showed. When I casually asked if the price included the chairs, the "gentleman" literally laughed at me, turned around, and walked away without saying a word. Humiliated, I followed him into the other room and stated that I should assume that it didn't. His very flippant reply to me was, "The chairs cost $800 a piece!"...and proceeded to turn his back on me once again. I had $4,000.00 cash in my pocket that day to make a purchase and he and his business not only lost out that day, but I will never make a purchase from that man if that's the way he's going to treat his customers!

I have never had a good restaurant experience at Toby Keith's. There was a time, when literally EVERY order I placed, whether food or drink came back wrong. Not to mention the servers are a bunch of ASU chicks that are too hot (in their own minds) for their own good, and thus the attitude reflected. Ate there last night...ordered a hamburger. 45 minutes later I received my burger which was mediocre at best. Toby....stick to playing bad music!

I haven't had a Family Doctor in a number of years. Had I known about Dr Reed's practice then, that wouldn't have been the case. Dr Reed's practice is clean and welcoming and his receptionist is kind and engaging. Dr Reed himself is patient and listens thoroughly, while taking the time to understand and accommodate his patient's concerns. I would highly recommend Dr Reed and his staff to anyone looking for a doctor.
