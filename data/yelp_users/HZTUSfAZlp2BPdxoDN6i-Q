For Honors members, this a great hotel.  It's the same idea as Embassy Suites, but much more modern and well decorated (which i think is why they retained the Hilton brand name with Embassy design).  For gold and diamond members, internet is free (at all Hilton properties), the top two floors are honors floors (quieter with less kids), and preferred parking is available.  The rooms are nice and updated (especially compared to some other US Hilton properties).  With free breakfast and free drinks every night, this place is a great value.  Plus it's on a light rail stop for a 10 minute ride to Suns games and downtown events.

The most honest dentists in Arizona;  I've been going to them for years.  They will tell you if you do not need work (unlike other dentists) or give you options.  They don't believe in the price gouging of many other offices, so they keep their prices as low as possible.   When I was in college years ago, I  made an appointment with a new dentist for a cleaning - who told me I needed $4,000 in work (might as well have been $1,000,000 at that time).  The finance person sat by my reclined chair and asked questions while my mouth drooled into a blue paper cloth.  I didn't buy their sales pitch. Over the next few years, I experienced several other dentists with the same used car sales attitude toward my oral health.  Do dentists have to take a class on up-selling to get DDS or DMD?   Davinci Dental was finally a breath of fresh air.  They told me the truth (e.g. gums slightly receded, but no periodontal surgery necessary; just floss and rinse regularly).  Rachel and Brian are a married dental couple and Nancy has been with them for years.  They truly care about their patients who become part of their family.   Now damn it, they aren't part of my insurance, but I'm considering paying cash just to use them..

I love this salon.  It's great for guys as it's inexpensive, they're really fast, and they do a great job.  The staff is super nice and all speak fluent English.  My sister gets her Nails done and says they're the best in the Gilbert area.   Beware that this place is not a spa.. if you are looking for a spa atmosphere, go to Dolce.  If you want a great cut and brow wax for $22 (and still look like a man) Kelly's is it.

This was our third vet for our Olde English Bulldogge puppy. They were incredibly responsive, helpful, friendly, and most importantly, knowledgable about our breed.  The cost was a little less than the other clinics as well.   As far as pushing products (as mentioned in another review): like all vet clinics, they seemed to be aligned with certain brands, but told us our brands were great and to keep using them.  Our dog's dental health is fine, so they said to keep doing what we're doing... Absolutely no hard sales.  They'll be our vets for life.

I was on my way to another restaurant, saw the picture of #66 sandwich on the, well, sandwich board, and had to have it. Yes, boiled eggs are usually an indication of dry things to come, but it seemed worth the risk. The balance of sauce and other ingredients produce an independent item with near perfect new flavors.    About the only thing better than the food is the service. The staff is friendly, patient, and helpful - in a natural unforced manner.   On a side note: food, especially sandwiches and/or eggs, are generally either not photogenic (see: any place with pictures on the menu) or look over produced (Barbara Walters lens filter with a side of vibrant greens for a youthful effect). Zookz somehow cracked the code - the pictures are great.  Great job!

We had a really bad visit. :( - The bar said they were out of Bloody Mary mix - meanwhile, we see a bartender pouring it - They said they were out of sourdough, although several items on the menu state that they come with it. They replaced with a bun without asking.  - The food took more than an hour to come out. - one sandwich was forgotten. After mentioning it twice, 1/2 hour after everyone else got their food, a manager finally came out to ask if we'd gotten it (we hadn't). He never said I'm sorry - just said, "I'll check." - The food was gross.  Most meals were in edible. The nachos were terrible - had a pool of grease left at the bottom.  - The drinks were so weak, we watched the bartender pour.  He did put one splash of alcohol - not even close to a shot pour.  We demanded new drinks.   - After a comprehensive discussion about splitting the bill three ways before ordering, one bill was delivered.  The waitress proceeded to ask all the same questions as before, but had each of us review what we ate.  - 4 of 6 in our group said its the worst meal we've had in a long time, if not ever. No apologies were ever given and definitely no offers of a comping a single item.. We will never ever eat at Zipps again. Yuk!
