Is this the best Vietnamese food I've ever had? No, but for the price it's pretty decent without having to drive all the way to Chandler. Two bowls of pho and two orders of goi cuon for $15-16 is a steal. Very homely taste to the broth and finally a place where goi cuon is inexpensive (it's $2.50 for two pieces). The Vietnamese music in the background and the decent amount of Vietnamese people dining inside add to the authenticity of the place.   But beware of the shady area it's in. Located in a tiny strip mall in a not so great area of Phoenix, I would not feel comfortable driving a really nice car here. Or if you had to because it's your only form of transportation, then I'd recommend parking it in front of the restaurant where you can at least keep an eye on it through the windows while you're eating. Probably not the cleanest restaurant either but I'll keep coming back until I find a reason to not to lol.    When I have a craving for Vietnamese food I'll be back to have my fill until I can make it back home and eat some good food in San Jose.

I was so excited to try this place finally after seeing them on Cupcake Wars. I wouldn't say I'm a cupcake snob but I have my likes and  dislikes with Sprinkles and Kara's. I still don't have a favorite cupcakery though I do love certain flavors at the places I've been to. I have tried sweet daddy's in Glendale three times trying to like it but have come to the same conclusion each time I've been there. I don't like that place and bigger cupcakes do not mean they're better. But I digress...  I bought four today-strawberry, brown velvet, banana, and orange blossom. I couldn't even wait to get home to try one so I opened the box right in the store and ate the strawberry. I was underwhelmed. I have a big sweet tooth but the cake AND frosting were way too sweet. Not only that but the frosting had the consistency of shortening, extremely dense and greasy. I felt like I was eating flavored butter. I ate the whole thing but it didn't sit well in my stomach. I went home and took a nap. I woke up wanting a snack so I tried the orange blossom cupcake. Again the frosting was extremely greasy and dense. I had to scrape the frosting off this time because I couldn't bear to eat it all. Now my stomach feels unwell, almost like that time I came back from Heart Attack Grill when it was in Chandler because of all the lard I ate. So the verdict? I will not be back and the quest for "perfect cupcakery" continues.

Like others, what drove me to try out their cupcakes was their appearance on Cupcake Wars (even though they lost first round). All guys running a cupcake shop when many other contestants on that show were women...cool enough for me to pay a visit. Their location at the mall was another plus in that I could squeeze in some retail therapy.   The cupcake is much larger than ones you would find at most cupcakeries. I would recommend sharing one so that you can enjoy the flavor of one with only half the calories to burn off later at the gym. First one I had was the red velvet. I use that flavor as my benchmark for all the cupcake shops I visit whenever possible. Not sure why...maybe because it was the first flavor I had at sprinkles? Even though I think the red velvet at sprinkles isn't great at all.   Anyway, for the red velvet, it definitely was not a love at first bite moment. The cake portion tasted like grocery store grade cake. The frosting left much to be desired. While fluffy and light, it lacked flavor or any kind of special ooomph. I thought maybe I went on an off day so I tried Sweet Daddy's two more times. Next I tried the pink cadillac and the next time after that I had an oreo cupcake. Each time I was left with the same feeling. Glittery frosting and pretty presentations cannot make up for the lack of flavor and dry, bland cake. All style and no substance. As much as I love cupcakes, nothing except maybe a free cupcake would compel me to return to Sweet Daddy's if I ever had the munchies while shopping. Pretzels or DQ will get my business first.

Been here twice already and decided it was time to give this place the glowing review it deserves. First off, it is located in a ghetto/semi vacant strip mall. Once you get inside the store though, it is a simple looking bakery. There are many kinds of cakes and chocolates but I've been here mainly for the macaroons. I've also had a chance to try the peaches (look like the fruit but are like whoopie pies with some type of butter cream filling) and the cheesecake filled waffle cones. They are really good and I'd recommend them too. But back to the macaroons!  The first time I went, I was helped by the owner who is a very enthusiastic man. He even gave us an extra macaroon on the house! The macaroons are stored back in the freezer but he let us know which flavors they had and we picked from there. The second time a female employee helped us out and again let us know which flavors they had. These are small macaroons, which only take about 2-3 bites to finish. I believe they are 1.65 each. Don't let the size fool you though. They are packed full of flavor. So far I've tried coffee, mint, raspberry, caramel, white chocolate, mango, vanilla, pistachio, and dark chocolate. Personal favorites are the raspberry, mango, and mint.   Maybe next time I'll get around to trying the eclairs and other cakes they had but for sure the macaroons keep me coming back.
