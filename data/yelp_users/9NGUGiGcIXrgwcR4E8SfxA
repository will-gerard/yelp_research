Just went here with a friend for lunch and shared the gluten free pepperoni pizza.  It took 30 minutes to come out and half the crust was still uncooked and doughy. It was also completely bland and I was looking for gum to get the taste out of my mouth after it. The service was very slow, quiet, and reserved.  Will not be going back to this location. Only reason I gave two stars is because people have said they have good salads.

Native is one of my favorite places to go for wings, but this location is absolutely disgusting. A health inspector should go by there asap. My girlfriend and I walked into there today and a stench wall of raw sewage. We immediately asked if they could smell it and they simply stated, "oh, there's been a stench from the bathroom for a few days.  We are trying to get someone to come look at it soon."  The fact that they are cooking food while there is fecal matter floating through the air is completely unsanitary. It wasn't just a small hint of it either. It was like being smack in the face with a dirty diaper. Gross.

Worst customer service ever. Took 10 minutes to get seated and another 20 minutes before I even got acknowledged by a waiter. Food is decent, if you ever get it.  Can't wait for the Village Inn to finish being built across the street.  Once the new waitress came in, it definitely got better.

The service was great and friendly. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Gorgonzola Pizza and it was delicious and full of flavor.  Definitely will come back for more!
