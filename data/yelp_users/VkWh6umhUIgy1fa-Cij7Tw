We went for happy hour and ordered the goat cheese dip, fingerling potatoes, french onion burger, and the forbidden rice. Goat cheese dip was so so. Fingerling potatoes were very yummy with fried sage and rosemary and a lemon aioli. The french onion burger was AMAZING and ranks high on my list of delicious burgers. The forbidden rice was really good too and had a delicious sweet coconutty taste to it. Drinks were real cheap too - I got a four peaks hop knot for less than the price of a diet coke!   I'll definitely be going back.

Could be the worst service I've ever experienced. Ghost bartenders who disappear for 15 minutes at a time. Food also takes way too long.

I came to the place expecting to be disappointed given the moderately high prices, the location and the fact that it was fairly empty at the time. However, the amount of food that I was served definitely justified the price. My boyfriend and I ordered falafel fries, the spicy chicken wrap and the lentil soup. All that ended up providing us both with two meals! Pretty good value if you ask me. Plus, the lentil soup and spicy chicken wrap were delicious. The falafel fries were pretty good, but a little dry. I would order everything again.  I encourage everybody to try this place!

This place fills a gap that is definitely needed in the area. Fast, delicious, and relatively cheap breakfast food and coffee. Yesterday I had the low carb breakfast in a tomato basil wrap - warm eggs, fresh greens, potato, and pesto sauce. It was fantastic! The iced coffee was smooth, almost-carmely (not sweet), and delicious. I highly recommend this place any day. Oh, and they're open early!   Beyond the food, the place looks great and has a beautiful patio. It stands out amongst some of the eyesore plazas of Apache. The only down side - they close at 4pm.

Great food, reasonable prices and nice ambience. We sat at the bar and watched the cooks prepare our food, which I always enjoy. The cook struck up some nice conversation with us and was very friendly. The menu was just the right size - not too daunting with good variety. For appetizers we got the calamari fries and the brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts themselves are enough to go back. So good!!! For entree, we ordered the wood fire grill plate with flank steak. It was healthy and tasty and fresh - perfect if that is your mood. We also ordered the pork belly and the duck confit steamed buns. The pork belly was my favorite of the two. I look forward to going back and trying the mongolian beef bowl, the spicy seafood hotpot, and the bananas foster fritters. They looked so yummy!!!
