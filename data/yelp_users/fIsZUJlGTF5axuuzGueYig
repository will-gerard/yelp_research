THIS CAR WASH SUCKS!   The meters are inaccurate, I have timed their 3:00 for $2 and it is only 2:40. That is fraud.  I've timed it twice. Also, whenever you change from one function to the next, say from high pressure wash to spot free rinse, or hot wax, it can take over 20 seconds for the selected product to arrive at the wand. I have been here three times and left angry each time. No more chances for them.    DON'T GO HERE!

It's not fancy, but I really do enjoy their food. The service isn't always the fastest, but it's a nice place, and I always leave having enjoyed my meal. Whenever I have family visiting, I do take them here, because I know it will be an enjoyable experience!

Generous portion sizes, pleasing presentation, and nice service and nice atmosphere. The medium spice was a bit hotter than expected, and the ginger binger chicken was a bit heavy on the soy sauce. Tom kha soup was quite good, powerful onions though.   I would come again, but will check out the next few places first.

I don't know if they're just having a bad day or what, but I wanted to do a warranty exchange on my radiator, and the guy didn't understand when I had purchased the old one. The smart money would to be to look it up on my account, which I suggested they do, but the manager came over and got snippy with me and said that I was being crappy. I don't know what kind of customer service you have, but telling the customer that he's being crappy isn't very good, whether he's being crappy or not. I asked for my receipt back and left the store.
