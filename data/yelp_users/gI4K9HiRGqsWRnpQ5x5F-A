It is truly a traditional church. Very traditional. I didn't know what I was walking into and did not feel welcome. That's okay...but it is for the person seeking a very traditional service. Really, it's a conservative church, rather regressive, really.

Someone wrote me and added that the mass is not a social event or group that one needed to gain acceptance. Correct. We' re all supposed to be accepted in God's church. However, several made it blatantly clear that their judgment of us went no further than the thickness of our clothing.

First time here for me and one of several times for my wife. We ordered the chicken tikka masala and another dish with chicken and spinach along with a little dessert at the end. Our senses were poised for a good time as we approached the restaurant. The quality of the food did not let us down. It was perfectly spiced and seasoned and gave the impression of a carefully and skillfully prepared meal. My wife was not very fond of the rice pudding, representing an area of compromise between us as I differ. Upon noticing that my spoon was now invading her cup of rice pudding, the owner provided my wife with two other alternatives to sweeten her pallette. My wife and I spent a nice weekday dinner escape and found quality food, service and care for us as customers all for what "the average Joe" can expect to spend at a high volume and taste deficient place like Applebee's. That's why I'll be back to the Star of India and I may yet again have two servings of rice pudding if my wife allows me.

I was looking for a jeweler to provide my engagement ring. Being an important occasion, I wanted to get a beautiful ring from someone knowledgable who provided great customer service. On my first visit I met Ed. He sat me down and casually filled me in on the Coffin & Trout difference. I ultimately chose to work with Ed and he helped me create a stunning ring for my fianc√©. It was nice to have Ed on my corner as he helped me get the most from my investment, both financially and creatively.  He and C&T are definitely the best I encountered and I'll be back time and time again.

Pancakes and biscuits are a commodity to be found in many places. At Biscuits you're getting good food, made fresh and with an extra helping if friendly service and a warm smile, too. Imagine, someone actually smiling while they look you in the eye. Is it 1981? My wife, nicknamed "Cheekiebaby, tried their biscuits and corn beef hash and she said, "it was definitely made from scratch and it isn't greasy." I had the breakfast sandwich which hit the spot.  So much so it kept me silent for several minutes while I ate. I also ordered a pancake to go along. Hey, don't criticize, I'm writing reviews as a public service! Moving forward, the pancake was delicious. It came with warm syrup and creamy butter. One thing I noted is that the pancake is dense. That's okay with me, but it'll fill you up. For those wanting pancakes to mirror their fashionable cousin the crepe, you may want to have just one pancake or choose something else. Biscuit's pancakes ain't nothing to be messed with. Much like the no nonsense, quasi Midwestern feel I get from the restaurant's decor, these pancakes are will get the best of you if you're not ready for some serious eats. I'm looking forward to exploring the menu on other occasions and maybe next time I'll come ready for two pancakes.

Great Italian food. Nice environment, but no unnecessary pretense or snobbery.  Friendly staff. Definitely a favorite of mine for Italian fare.

Great Steak and sides.  Very trendy. Nice place to go but not if you want to talk and relax.

My father and I recently attended the smoking class. I learned a lot about cooking and handling meat, not just smoking.  You really get "hands on" in this class and learn plenty of skills. It's given me a lot of confidence and motivation to cook more. I definitely recommend it. It's fun and you learn a lot.

PHX Burrito has what many others fail to achieve. Fresh ingredients and FLAVOR! Its an attractive spot and my burrito and horchata were delicious. Their homemade salsa nailed what a good salsa should do in complimenting a burrito. You should try it!
