This place has just been on point with my special drinks and the staff here has been fantastic and friendly.

The food was decent, but I just didn't like how packed it was for dim sum. It would be nice if the cart came into our section often. So we didn't get much food and variety.

The Dim Sum isn't very good here. The chicken feet had no flavor at all. Everything just under-seasoned. Service wasn't all that great either.

Every time I come back to Chandler, I always want to come back to this boba joint. I always get Red Bean slush with extra red beans on the bottom. I absolutely love this drink. I can't really find any place that makes it like at this boba joint.

It's my first time here. I had a take out order. My sub was the firehouse meatball. It was really good. The food was made very quick since I'm just down the street. They were very friendly and the place looked cute. The cookie and brownie were yummy. I love the fact that they had the subs in a togo box and not wrapped. I would come back again.

Maybe because I'm a hard critic and from California, but the Thai Tea I had was super milky and I couldn't really taste the tea.

I really love the seats here. I love the fact that you can choose your seats so no one can take your seat and you don't have to fight for it. My experience has been great. I started to bring a blanket so I can get cozy and watch the movie. :)

The customer service is terrible here. Most of the games were broken and every card machine to reload money on the card has some sort of issue.
