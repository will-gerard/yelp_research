Where to start?  A friend recommended this place.  Service:  We went later in the night so it wasn't busy at all. However, you would've thought it was packed because we had to wait a while to get drinks; refills; our order taken; condiments after getting our food (had to ask him twice); and finally, the bill.   Food:  After reading the reviews on Yelp, and our friend's suggestion, I really wanted to try their chicken fried steak. Well, that was a bad idea because it was difficult to chew, the gravy looked like it had been out for too long and starting to curdle, and the extremely sweet candied carrots took up over a quarter of the plate, BUT the mashed potatoes were delicious.  The bf got the rack of ribs, which I got to try and that is the only reason this place gets two stars, because the whole night and all through the next day I had FOOD POISONING!!!!  I wish I had listened to Renee S.' review and steered clear from this place...never again!

I have eaten here twice, once for dinner, once for lunch.  When I came for dinner I was impressed by the food (especially the mud pie) and the service; but this last time coming in for lunch, I had such wonderful service and food that I had to say something.  The hostess greeting was quick and super pleasant. Great!  The waiter, Jacob was patient and more than happy to explain the menu and answer questions. Great!  When it came to changing our minds on stuff, he was completely professional and did not make us feel bad at all!! Totally great!  Also, when we had a question about the bill, he was good enough to listen to us and take care of the issue. THAT, was fabulous customer service!! Thank you Jacob for being the highlight of our visit! I will definitely go back there - hopefully when Jacob is working!  BTW - the food was absolutely delish!!    :)
