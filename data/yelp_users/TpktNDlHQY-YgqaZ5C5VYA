I LOVE IVY! Great instructors, great classes - variety and healing. The different classes offer different styles of yoga for needs based on now. Today I may need relaxing and tomorrow I may need challenging. They have it all in a comfortable, warm environment.

Love the good and the ambiance. Service can be a little slow, but friendly. Today was very fast, despite only two servers on, but it was a slow time of day.

Overpriced food, slow service, flavors were either just spicery or non existent. Decor was cute. We will not be returning. Carne asada was gamey, tamale was dry, torta was all bread, tilapia was greasy.

il vinaio is a pleasure! The food is fantastic - very robust flavors and a menu that is constantly being updated. Service is friendly and atmosphere is phenomenal. The owners are very involved and work tirelessly to know their customers and create a warm, inviting environment. John - the musician that plays requests on Saturday nights is great fun.  This is a place for friends, family, kids. I highly recommend it!

First time there after a recommendation from friends. Food was great,  good value,  conciencious service. Cute decor - very festive. The only drawback was the booths wiggled everyone our neighbors would move.  The cloth napkins were a lovely touch.
