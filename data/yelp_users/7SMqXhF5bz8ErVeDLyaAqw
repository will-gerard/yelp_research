Went for lunch on a week day with a girl friend and really enjoyed!  Ordered the stuffed shrimp as an appetizer and it was delicious. Ordered a house salad, it was DELISH. Their dressing is a SOOO GOOD. Very fresh!  The atmosphere was very comfortable. Had to try the pizza. Order the Margherita. Nicely done, the mozzarella was REAL mozzarella. Most places nowadays don't know how to make a genuine authentic Margherita pizza.   Only downfall was there was only two servers. They were slammed. Would have been nice to actually get a more personal experience from the wait staff.   I will be going back!

Went in late at night, got sat right away. Waiter was pretty friendly at first. Ordered our drinks which seemed like FOREVER to get. There was hardly anyone even there, there was more staff than people.   Ordered the Buffalo Mac and Cheese. Let's just say it was pasta and dried out boneless wings. It wasn't even hot and creamy like a mac and cheese should be.   My friend ordered the New Yorker sandwich. The sandwich and fries came out COLD. GTFO. We let the waiter know about how cold the sandwich was and he took it back to the kitchen. He seemed very irritated that the food was cold. We then asked for the sandwich to go after waiting so long for the 2nd sandwich, we asked for the manager. Waited 10 minutes for the manager...while waiting for the manager, our server then started with the excuses..."We don't have that many people on" "I am doing everything, busing, exposing, running my own food." Who wants to hear those excuses? What was he willing to do to make it right?? I work in the service industry I play all roles at times too...that is not an excuse. When the manager finally came he took care of everything. Was very happy that he took full responsibility for the restaurant.   I will not go back there again. Very disappointed.
