We stayed at the Pointe Hotel on a stacation and tried unsuccessfully to get reservations at A Different Point of View, so ended up here. What a disappointment. I had the Trout and, my mistake, asked for it to be sautéed, it was overlooked and tasted of butter. The potatoes and all the other veggies that came with it were so buttered that this was all you could taste. Head Office had the Salmon which she said was fine. The reason we had fish was because there was absolutely nothing on the menu that was Veggie, though our overthetop waiter did offer to make something up from another dish. Overall, a bad experience and I had been there before many years ago and also to the one at the South Mountain point and was not disappointed.

I have been a member of this gym since before it opened and I am quitting now. This gym has become an absolute dump. The membership has been allowed to increase to a level that makes the place absolutely packed in the evenings. There is absolutely no discipline enforced to members who do not follow the rules, such as putting weights back on the racks, wiping down machines after use, filling the weight room with personal bags and "other junk". The place is an absolute tip in the evenings. I made a complaint to one of the 3 "Managers" today about the increasing number of members, and he simply responded by saying that they have to get their quotas up, that was it. No consideration was givens to anything I said to him "We have to get our quotas up!!!" I need to find a good gym that has some level of concern for the customer, so any recommendations are welcome. LA Fitness you are doomed! I tried to do zero Stars but it wouldn't let me.

We tried for a second time after the first takeaway was so hot we couldn't eat it; the reviews were good so we made sure we clearly told them the spice levels we wanted. HO had Pad Thai and I had Kang Pa, which was a mistake as I like a thick curry sauce, but it was still delicious. HO2 had mild curry. Overall it was very good and tons of food! Will be back for sure

This is now another go-to Sushi restaurant with delicious food and drinks selections. The only reason I deducted a star was because of the service, it wasn't bad but the ladies who served all seemed to have the attitude that we should know what we want and they were a tad impatient. The lady on the front door was not of the atypical Japanese service style, she was a little rude and not at all courteous. She told us to wait and we would have a table shortly, which we did. She reminded me of a character out of the Seinfeld "Chinese restaurant" episode! Three of us had the Daily Special Sashimi dish which was excellent.

We had a very nice meal here last night. The curries were pretty authentic and carried enough spice to make them very tasty. Unusual location but it wasn't hard to find. Good service, though we were only ones there when we finished at 8pm.

I don't know what was going on this Saturday but the food has taken a turn for the worse at C4. There was a Horse charity event taking place at the stage out the back but this was no excuse for the food we received there last night. This place has always been a favorite spot in Cave Creek but doubt we will go there again now on last nights performance. It was very quiet also and I don't know if this is a reflection of the food or what. The service was very good.

Went to the cinema for the first time in 2 years to watch Moonrise Kingdom. It was full so we had to pick an alternate and we made a bad choice, People Like Us, which was rubbish. At the beginning of the show during the previews there was no picture at all, and there was nobody there to ask for help. The picture finally came on at the beginning of the film. Diane stayed to the bitter end, I went to Yardhouse to reflect and promise myself never to go to the movies again!

Had a very nice meal in there on 5/10. Bengan bartha was tasty and the only poor part of the meal were the nan breads, they were not at all fresh. Good prices though and good service and Fullers ESB to boot!!

We had a lovely dinner here last night and we have never been anything but happy with the food and service here. They spice these exactly as you ask them and the food is so delicious and plentiful that we have always found this a great place to dine. We especially like the Ceviche starter which is always very tasty and filling. Great place!

Went last night to watch The Full Monty, which was excellent, however, the food was terrible. Firstly I ordered a Martini which could not have had ANY alcohol at all, it tasted like fruit juice. They took it back and I had some wine. My wife and I had different dishes and they both were obviously pre-cooked; the food was bland, warm, tasteless and poorly presented. If you want to watch a great show, go and see the Full Monty, but, as other customers have recommended, do NOT eat there, it is way overpriced for the quality of food and presentation so eat first and enjoy the show with a nice drink - not Martini though!!

Mainly disappointed with the tepid, very weak coffee. Place looks OK and the interior was clean and comfortable. The waitress we had was sullen and offered no suggestions and dint smile the whole time, but then people are allowed bad days. Wouldn't return, especially as there are amazing places such as Liberty Market to compare it with (though far apart in distance and quality)! Food was only average. A lot could be done with a place like this as there is not much around, so we were disappointed as we were hoping to find a decent breakfast joint.

We dropped in last night for a snack before the Sigur Ros concert (Amazing!) and came away totally unimpressed. The waiter was extremely nice and very attentive but the food was very blah! I had the Pesto Pasta with shrimp and it was OK but not enough flavour  at all. Annie and Di shared the Lettuce wraps which were very "wet", and then they shared the Veggie sandwich which was also nothing to write home about. On top of it all Di was sick in the night but that is likely due to her having a Margarita. Won't be back there.

Had a great waitress, excellent food and first class wine and drinks at the Kitchen last night. The waitress, who is part Columbian and part Lebanese was extremely attentive and helpful. We had the Penang curry which was very tasteful and authentic, and the Farmers Market salad. The Truchard Pinot was pricey but worth it. The misters kept us cool despite the incredible heat of the evening. The AC was due to be replaced and inside it was muggy so sitting outside was a fair option. Would recommend this place and never saw or heard any examples of snootiness from anyone.

I had my staple ( yes I have it every time I go there) the Penang Curry, usually it is very good but have noticed over the last two visits that it is getting very watered down, and last night it was way too fluidic and had very little Tofu or rice in it. Not impressed, and Diane had the the roast chicken which was not very good, lots of chicken but very little else and she was I'll when we got home. Going downhill or just a bad night, who knows?

Well it didn't start off too good. We were not served for some time even though it did not seem busy. It was hot but there were a few tables full outside!  Diane's Mojito was not very memorable because it had no mint taste, but the very helpful waitress did bring more. I had the Ahi tuna salad which was very good and Diane had the Beet salad which was also good except for the Salmon she had with it which was much too salty. Their IPA was very good and we shared a crime brûlée which was delicious. The very friendly and helpful waitress even spoilt me with a fresh brewed coffee to go when I asked her to heat up the coffee she brought me originally. Overall a nice place and friendly staff and reasonably priced.

Overall a nice place and friendly staff and reasonably priced. Second visit with Mike and Karen - written up by Head Office. I ordered the Friday fish fry as the waitress told me how good it was. I was very disappointed as the fish was over cooked and chewy.  I should have known from the presentation. it was hard to tell it was even cod,shaped like a sausage and sitting on a soggy piece of lettuce. The potato cakes were tasty and I was so hungry I ate most of the fish. The sangria was very heavy - gave me a headache - not light and fruity the way I like sangria.   Our friends were not very impressed with the steak in their steak salad and didn't get it cooked the way they ordered. Our waitress was very nice and friendly but I'm afraid she couldn't make up for the unappetizing food.   I wanted to give Tryst another chance after our first visit with the much too salty salmon, but I certainly won't be going there again.

We use this place quite a lot simply because the food is so delicious. Every dish we have had from here (and most of our meals are takeaway)  has been so tasty. We were vegetarians for many years and we are happy to find somewhere like this were we can indulge on our veggie preferences.  The only recommendations are these - make the name more recognizable and easy to remember ( we have often found it hard to find on yelp and google because it is difficult to remember), and consider an alcohol license as this food goes down well with a good Kingfisher or other cold lager. But overall, we have yet to have a bad meal from this place.

I have to say that the dinner we had last night at Rusconi's was by far the best I have had in years. John the server was very attentive, not at all rushy and very knowledgeable.  Head Office had the Salmon and I had the Sea Bass, which was the best I've had, even including one I had in Chile!  Service was impeccable, the ambience ideal and the wine list was adequate.  For Dessert we shared a peach pudding which was made for the day fresh. It was delicious.  Very nice restaurant and we will definitely be back.

Had a very nice dinner here last night, with great service and lots of delicious food. We had a couple of dosai, a veggie curry and Lamb Vindaloo which was delicious. Good prices. It was very quiet there so I hope they survive as they are very close and we will be back.

What a fine place and what a fine outstanding Gentleman Vartan is, he really knows how to treat his clientele. The new store is beautiful and the humidor is very expansive, I can't wait to see the new lounge he is building. Will be back, often!
