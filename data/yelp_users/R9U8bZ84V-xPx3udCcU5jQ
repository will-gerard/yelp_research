This is the best bang for your buck pizza in downtown Phoenix.  $6 ($5.45 plus tax I think) gets you stuffed on homemade DECENT pizza and a soda...a great lunch on a budget.  It's about 3 blocks from my office so I love to walk down here and grab a quick couple slices and soda.  They usually have 5 or 6 different varieties out - a couple vegetarian options which I've never tried becuase let's be honest, why would I?  My favorite is probably their pepperoni and jalapeno pizza.  They do sell out of their pizza so you wanna get there during the rush if that's what you want...I got there at about 1:15 and they were sold out today - he said they sold out at 12:45...that's a little earlier than usual I think, but even if you get there late the pizza just isn't as fresh.  I got a turkey/ham sandwich special today.  $6.50 and it came with a soda and a cup of the homemade chicken and dumpling soup.  Great flavor and SO filling!  The sandwich was fantastic (even though absolutely not what I felt like eating) - it had some kind of oil or dressing on it that I couldn't put my finger on, but it was way better than the mustard/mayo I was expecting.  I was shocked to see a review on here criticizing the owners...these are by the far the nicest and most polite family owned restaurant I've ever seen.  My friend and I have a game where we like to see how many times they say "Thank you."  Sometimes you might get thanked 10 times!  They really do show that they appreciate your business and choosing their restaurant.  As always, I'll be back!

My wife and I were out to dinner trying to celebrate our Anniversary. Things were going well until I found a long black hair in my potatoes...gross.  I get that things happens, but I think the problem was that the manager seemed put out by the fact that I asked her to take my plate away. I had only had one or two of the ribs on the rack and they didn't replace the plate...I assumed they'd at least take the rib dinner off the bill being that they threw majority of it in the trash. Instead I get a $5 discount with an uber tacky memo reading "hair in pot"...I'll go to outback next time.  We've been to Texas Roadhouse many times and never had this kind of service...it was our first and last time at this location however.

My wife and in-laws decided to try the North Phoenix Bill Johnson's out tonight to celebrate my in-laws anniversary.  (My wife and I had never eaten there) We had been enticed to give it a shot after purchasing a deal chicken gift certificate.  Fool me once, shame on you...We were excited at the happy hour options and enjoyed a couple $1 beers...unfortunately, this is where the pleasantries stopped.  After ordering we spent over 40 minutes looking around the 1/3 full restaurant for our food to arrive.  At no point did our server, Charlean, apologize for the long wait or offer refills to my wife's soda.  When the food finally did come it was cold.  We would've mentioned it to our server but she didn't come back for 30 minutes to finally bring us our bill, and at no point did she ask us if we need anything else or if the food was meeting expectations.  I would've mentioned the experience to a manager, but after the hour and a half in the restaurant I didn't really feel like asking around to figure out who the manager was...particularly when we were trying to celebrate an anniversary.  I spent year's in the restaurant business and I don't know which is the most disappointing - slow/cold food, poor service, or the inability to locate a manager...regardless, if this is the Bill Johnson's standard of service, I will not be fooled twice.

After posting this last review and e-mailing it to the restaurant, we did receive a call from the manager.  We were invited to come back and try them again.  First they only wanted to give a meal to my wife and I, but I said considering the terrible experience we had the last time, I thought the 4 of us should be able to all come back.  He assured us, "Whenever you can make it in, just give the hostess your name and say it should be written in the book in the back.  She'll know what it means."  It made me a little nervous that they must be giving away quite a few meals if they have a code words like this.  Anyway - we mentioned it to the hostess, and she was confused and just sat us down.  We mentioned the same thing to the waitress and name dropped the manager's name.  She was also confused and at the end of the meal, came and brought us a full bill.  We ended up having to explain the whole thing to a manager which is a bit embarrassing, as we would've been happy to not come in the first place.  Eventually they comped a portion of our entrees and charge us for our sodas.   The food was faster and service was definitely better.  The food is still definitely forgettable - you're better off going to a national chain steak house or for some local BBQ try Honey Bears...Won't be back.

Best Mexican food I've ever had in Phoenix (probably anywhere to be honest).  This is my family's go to Mexican restaurant.  I get the Carne Asada burro everytime, my wife gets the Chimichanga.  I love their chips and salsa. Usually great service, although every once in a while it's a miss. They have a good happy hour too, good margaritas.  Prices are very fair, easy to eat under $10 regardless of time of day. Of course you can spend more if you'd like.  This restaurant has been here for decades which speaks volumes to the quality of the restaurant.

Great food, great service, LOVE the atmosphere with all the televisions.  The ONLY negative I dock it for is that they could definitely have better specials...which costs them a star, but everything else is great and we will definitely be back.

Just further customer service issues...sent an e-mail to Massage Envy as requested from the previous business response.  I received an e-mail a couple days later explaining that it was simply a bad match between me and my masseuse. They wanted a good time to call my phone and discuss further. I replied within an hour.  It's been a month and I've not received another e-mail or phone call. The poor communication just goes on and on.

Is it the best sandwich on Phoenix? No. Is it the best value? Quite possibly.   Cathy is the manager who I have seen in there almost every single time. After a couple visits with slow service (as mentioned in other reviews), We ended up with Cathy as our server. She took our orders quick and was on top of refills and the check. She made sure to give us her name and encourage us to request her in the future.   We learned are lesson with several of the other servers, but Cathy makes is feel like we're the most important regulars she has.   Awesome food specials on Wednesday and Thursday ($5 burgers and side and then $.50 hot wings). Great happy hour pricing as well.   Again, not the fanciest place and it's not 5 star food. But if you want good food for a great value with awesome service, swing by Steve's and ask for Cathy. Tell her Taylor sent you.

My wife and I went to Catch 22 for dinner on Friday night.  We had a great time!  We even had our 7 month old baby and we felt like the set up of the restaurant was conducive to the sports bar atmosphere, but still plenty of room between tables that we didn't feel like we were blocking any aisle/walkway.  Pros:  GREAT service! Lots of recommendations and she brought me a beer sample of the special for the evening.  (Thanks Leah!) Really cold beer! Mahi taco appetizers were phenomenal.  I've had some really really good fish tacos and some really really bad fish tacos.  These are some of the best. Wings were good...not great, but a pretty good deal for the price ($7/lb I think which was like 10 wings)  Lots of TVs - we went to watch the end of one baseball game (not Dbacks) and the start of the Dbacks game...we were able to get a good view of both games. I LOVED their patio set up.  Even though we didn't use it because it was just us and the baby, next time we may.  Nice couches and area.  Cons: We saw a high chair in the corner and grabbed it...a support beam on the bottom was broken...we asked for another high chair and we were told it was the only one they had.  I know they don't cater to a family restaurant, but any sports bar/grill should at least have a couple un-broken high chairs. Leah recommended the hamburger which was very good, however it was ordered medium and came out well done...I know this is very typical of restaurants, but if the policy is going to be to ask customers how a burger is to be cooked, it should be cooked that way.  Even though it was well done, the flavor was still great on it and we didn't complain.   We will be back.

Very very cool pub...I ran into this place off a restaurant.com certificate.   This place is an old house turned into a bar.  The fish and chips were great with an amazing price $6.99 I think.  Lots of beer options and attentive server.  I will DEFINITELY be back.  The ONLY complaint is that there isn't any parking.  We got valet parked at the restaurant next door which I guess technically is frowned upon but the valet guy said, "It's ok as long as you take care of me."  Throw in a few bucks for valet parking (which is kinda fun) and you still got yourself a great deal and a fun experience.  I will DEFINITELY be back.

My wife and I joke that this is our new "$100 store" because we can't get out of there without spending less than $100...we typically go in there for a single bottle of wine or a margarita mix and we end up with a 12 pack of local beer and a some wine.  They have wine tasting in the afternoons on Friday-Sunday.  Erika is usually pouring the wine on Sundays...she is VERY knowledgable and has gotten me onto some cabernet sauvignon....I used to strictly drink white wines.  She has no hesitation to smile and ask you if you want to "go down the line" trying all the wines.    Everyone in the store is very friendly and knowledgable, but on top of that - the prices are the best around and the selection is incredible.

I really like this place, but must admit we never pay full price.  We almost always get a $15 for $30 ticket which is perfect for a table for two...after tip we are usually out of there for just over $20 with having had a beer and a sandwich.  I love there Red Devil BBQ sandwich..it comes w/ coleslaw on top which is a great flavor with the hot sandwich advertised as "hotter than an Arizona summer".  They have $2 onion rings which obviously isn't a huge basket, but they are really good and we get them everytime.  I took off a star because the last 2 times we've been here my loaded mashed potatos have come out very cold...when I mentioned it to the servers they apologized and came back w/ a heaping bowl of potatoes...IDK if they got microwaved, but they tasted great.  I've noticed that they do run a lot of drink specials (bar only) particularly during baseball games.  We need to go back and try the HH specials which we haven't done yet but it's on our to do list.

Great Chinese food at a great price in North Phoenix.  They have a coupon you can't beat - "Free Entree after spending $18"  The "free entree" is a limited selection but when you can get 3 entrees and an appetizer for $20 you're doing great.  Big portions that always leave left overs.  We have eaten here twice for pick up and been very satisfied.  Only negative thing I can say is that my wife was disappointed with her chow mein/ "crunchy noodles"  as the noodles were not what she was expecting.  We called the resaurant to ask about it and the owner explained that that's what they were supposed to be...they weren't wrong, but she wasn't exactly concerned with correcting our disappointment in the meal (was hoping that maybe she'd offer some noodles/rice?  Not her fault that we'd never had "crunchy noodles", so still gets 5 stars.  We will definitely be back, but ALWAYS have the coupon, it's on their menu.

Better than pure IMO. Great DJ and fun crowd. Roof was closed for no known reason so they lost a star.

Every interaction with employees was terrible. $15 Wells. Horrible DJ. Only thing that saved our night was leaving and hitting up chateau. Avoid unless you have free entry AND drinks...free cover alone is not reason enough to waste your Vegas evening.

If anyone is from the midwest and you miss the good ol' Hy Vee atmosphere, you can finally get that in Phoenix at Winco.  Most of the time, the prices are much better than Wal-mart and most other competitors (though not always).  The place is clean and well stocked.  Produce is cheaper than anywhere else typically and is clearly a better quality. Hours are great at 24 hours a day too!  They have a lot of meat options and they boast fresh seafood coming in regularly, although I haven't purchased any seafood there yet.    The only 2 knocks I have on them is their beer/wine/liqour prices are a bit high.  If you need any of those, just head over to Total Wine and More! They also don't accept credit cards...has to be debit.  I like getting my 1% cash back when I grocery shop, but the savings overall makes up for it.

Only thing saving this from 1 star is the food actually tastes pretty good...they get that part right.  Have been here 3 or 4 times for the food, but consistently slow service.  There are lots of specials and coupons you can get for here, but lots of made up rules for example: I had like a $5 off coupon.  I ordered my regular priced meal which was $10+ after a drink, my friend ordered her meal off of the happy hour menu. They charged her full price + $3 to add like 2 little strips of chicken to her nachos (which she didn't tell us about until the bill came).  The server refused to split the bill even though my regular priced menu item way more than covered the value of the coupon...just terrible service consistenly.  Pros: Taste of food  Cons: Everything else

Love this little place that rivals Yen Sushi down the street for quality but dominates for price and service. Sushi Catcher is more of a Cafe or dine and the Happy Hour all day makes sushi on a budget totally doable.  As always with Sushi, we ordered way too much of it. I highly recommend the Vegas Roll and Tootsie roll...SO good.  The Rainbow Roll is OK, but for $7 (compared to $3-$5 I would definitely pass and get something else), unless you really want a sampler.  I'd skip the Casey roll too...kinda funny that the two most expensive ones were all of our least favorites.   Pros: service, price, quality, atmosphere Cons: Nothing

Went here for breakfast with my wife a couple months ago, but never got around to writing the review.  My Mama always said, "You won't always remember the things people said and did, but you always will remember the way they made you feel."  That's why SJ's gets two stars....the food wasn't memorable, we left agreeing we'd never eat breakfast there again...like another Yelper experienced, we were the only place in the very large restaurant.  When we walked in, around 9:30 on a Sunday morning, when "The Place" has a line out the door, there was nobody here...I mean, nobody.  I walked around....couldn't find anyone.  Eventually I poked my head in the kitchen and said, "HELLO????" I heard a voice shout back, "Just a minute."  Who knows what was going on...but next thing I know a young man, maybe 20, the cook - comes and takes our order.  He is clearly prepping food for the day.  At first, I think, that's kinda cool that the cook took our order, different anyway.  An older guy brings our food out, I'm guessing the owner.  He never said hi to us really, just dropped it off. The food was underwhelming, although the portion was enough to fill us up.  I had biscuits and gravy, not sure what my wife had.  I would say that if you're reading this trying to figure out if you're going to go there in the evening, the place is really low key and looked like it could be fun.  Great prices for happy hour beers/drinks were advertised...that could be a good time, but if you're the only one in there, it's just not that much fun.  Two stars....because the star rating descriptor couldn't be any more accurate, "Meh. I've experienced better."
