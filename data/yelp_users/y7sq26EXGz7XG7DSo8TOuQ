I'll preface this with the fact that I am biased AGAINST businesses that have limited hours. I work night shift and it is already hard enough to wake up late and do errands in the limited time places are open, to include doctor visits. At least with a doctor I can understand their hours - who is going to go get a surgery at 8pm? Nobody. BUt I do believe that if you have a business that is selling goods to the public that it is good business practice to stay open at least past rush-hour so that people can get off work and come in and shop.  With that said, I got to Ryan's at 4:32pm after driving from south, southern chandler (south of the Chandler Fashion Mall) and going 10mph on the highway. I walked in 2 minutes after they closed (by my watch) and didn't even think that they would be closed. I zipped into the showroom not even thinking that a pet store would be closing at 4:30 and I had the worker behind the counter yelling at me as I went in, "excuse me sir, we are closed." No eye contact. No sorry.  I needed one item.  I used to work retail. I know how it is to have that customer come in 1 minute before you close... and 1 minute after you close. I was that supervisor that had to tell them to  hurry up or come back the next day. But I feel that I did it with courtesy and understanding in how I  ran my store and what I could do within reason. I never, ever snapped at someone and just gave them some blanket statement that we were closed and insinuated to leave without even eye contact.  I am pretty sure that I wasn't the only customer there - I could have easily grabbed my item and left before they did. But at the tone that I got... I didn't even want to ask if I could get in and get out.  So I am lost of what to say. I can't really judge the store itself or the prices... because I barely got past the front door. What I can judge it on is their customer service, their attitude, and their store policy. For this, I give them low rankings. I do understand they have hours that they need to maintain... but they could have at least been nice about it.  Furthermore, there is little-to-no need for me to wreck my schedule just so I can come in and visit their store during their limited business hours. I'll shop elsewhere.

I dropped off some shears for my girlfriend and they seemed to be pretty good people despite me having no clue what I was doing.   Word of warning - they are the door that is ACROSS the way from the warehouse door. Do not go in the warehouse side. Walking from McDowell, take the right side of the drive-through thing.

Sonic, eating with you is a crapshoot. You either are oddly surprised at how good your food is or you are smacked in the face with the blatant fact that you are eating some of the most processed food you'll ever have.  You are generally quick, and sitting in your car... well, I just love it when my car will smell like a chili dog.  But your drinks. Gosh, you come up with some masterpieces. Nerds in my drink? Who would have thought!? DELICIOUS GLORY!

What is there to not like about this place? The only thing I can knock it on is that it isn't as big and bad as other zoo's. Nevertheless, you will have fun here. IMHO, it is geared more towards kids than adults as it has rides, petting zoos, trains, etc. this isn't bad as most of the time you are taking the kids too.

I jumped in for a quick bite to eat. Quick and easy. The sauces were hot (a little too hot for me, but hey I am white) but good.  Would definitely come back. Felt authentic as well. +5

So I normally go to the one in Tempe and decided to go to this one. I see a lot of comparisons between the two so I wanted to see the difference.   And quite frankly, I'm not sure what they are talking about. Both of them seemed to have generally the same stuff.   Good clean store, but as the Tempe location is closer, I will continue to go to that store instead.

I've never really had a problem at Sky Harbor. It's always been quick and easy. Airport is generally clean as well.  PS - I hate the TSA and their feel-you-up searches.

I called after-hours and Sandy took my call. She was very kind and helpful. She took my information and when they officially opened shop they called me back and made an appointment. Thus far they have called multiple times to keep me updated on any times or that the tech is en-route. Tech (Tom) arrived on time and was very good. He seemed very straight forward and honest. He was respectful of me and the animals that were brave enough to come out and investigate.  Do your technician a favor though, offer them some water when they are working - it is hot outside and blazing hot in the attic!

So one lonely night... OK wait... it wasn't lonely...  I was at a friends house...  And we were playing Mario Kart on the Wii (very fun BTW).  We got a craving for chili dogs (and no we weren't smoking!)  So, we headed out to Sonic, since that was the only place we knew that would have chili dogs at 10pm. We pulled up, looked at the menu and went... MEEEHHH...  So I wipped out my phone and opened Yelp and did a search for "chili dogs" and up popped up Mim's.  We pulled up and I'll be honest... the place was looking downright shady. If someone discharged a gun while we sat there, I don't think I would have been too surprised (this was late at night and the only thing that illuminated the weird colored building was one flickering street lamp). My friend looked over to me and was like "are you SURE this is the place??????" with a bewildered look on his face. I was like, yep, sure is! Just then, someone walked out looking normal and unmugged (I guess). I said, well, let me tell you this... 11 people reviewed this place and it still maintains a 4.5 star rating. It can't be that bad!  So we went in.  Boy was this place awesome! The menus is just outrageous. It has things on the menu that I've never seen before. It is a bit messy with things crossed out and white-out'd. But as another poster mentioned, it smelled good in there. Like, back home cooking where people made stuff from scratch, not ripped it out of a prepackaged box and  tossed it on a grill for 30 seconds.  BONUS! The place has old pinball machines and arcade games! HOLY HELL this is freaking badass! I'm actually glad the food took a while to make because it gave us a chance to be little schoolboys from 1986 and cram quarters and get our fix in!   Seriously cool and I will be back for more chili dogs and bologna and BBQ bologna sandwiches!

I've done everything from mountain biking, to short hikes, to all day hikes in South Mountain. And first let me say that I feel that I've yet to really get into even a fraction of what South Mountain has to offer.  First off, the BEST place to get information on South Mountain is at HikeArizona.com. For SM specifically, go here http://hikearizona.com/traildex.php?ID=34&sRID=52&SHOW=YES  I've done all or parts of the Mormon Loop, Guadalupe Ridgeline, Desert Classic, Pima East Loop, Pima West Loop, Javalina, Dirt Road, National, Geronimo, and Telegraph Pass. In other words, I've been on many of the eastern trails but haven't even touched the western trails. I need to get on that!  With that said, these ARE shared trails. You very well may encounter mountain bikers on these trails. Some of them are VERY inconsider it and go racing down and run over everything. If I remember correctly, a lot of people consider SM as a mecca of mountain biking and some even train for competitive mountain biking here. And from my experience, it is pretty good for mountain biking... even though I suck at it.  With that said, I am more of a hiker. I enjoy getting away from the hustle and bustle of the city and mountain bikers nearly riding by and clipping your ankle can be a bit bleh of this mountain. I want peace and quiet, yo! So I am going to say this... if you're looking for solitude, you may not find it here - especially when the weather is nice and on the weekends. If you want solitude, you'd be better off in the White Tank Mountains, especially if you can muster a 14mile trip... or the Superstitions. Neither of those places have I ever encountered mountain bikers (The White Tanks actually has a designated area for bikes). Likewise, Piestawa and Camelback mountains are always packed with people.  So, know your goal. If it just for exercise, the South Mountain is one of my favorite, partially because it is close to my house. If I want no people then it is Superstitions or White Tanks.  This should go without saying, but bring water. Let me correct myself, bring more water than you think you'll ever need. Arizona is notorious for dehydrating people. I personally bring a Camelbak 3L (100oz) filled completely up with water. I also bring a few flashlights/headlamps just in case I find the sun setting on me when I'm still out there.  Which reminds me... I've done numerous night hikes with the moon on SM. I actually didn't need a night except a few times where I wanted to make sure of my footing. So, if you aren't afraid of the dark... I highly suggest going hiking at night! It also gives a WONDERFUL view of the big sprawling city we call home - Phoenix. It's view off the National and Geronimo is supa-dupa awesome.  With that said, I give this trail a 5 star only because I think it offers so much and has a lot of diversity. It's not a trail system that you get into and go "oh ****" a mile in and have to turn back. There are so many options to match your skill level and desired activity that it almost seems ridiculous. It may take a few times going to get a trail route figured out that you like (right amount of people, no bikes, good views, etc.) but once you do then it is golden.  On an impersonal note, parking can be busy during peak times. And, the gates close at sunset. You can still drive out after dark though. Park is dog friendly but please pack out what you pack in (I'm talking about dog poop here).  Enjoy and see you out on the trail!

As little kids we indulge in painting, playing with clay, drawing, doodling, music, and all sorts of other creative things. However, as adults sometimes it seems that even listening to music can be a hassle to our busy schedules.   As You Wish is a great excuse to go and be a kid again. All those things we do as kids are relaxing and allow us to operate parts of our brains we probably don't get to in our careers/jobs. You don't need to be an artist or have any art skills to do this stuff, just come to have fun. Will your piece come out looking like something you want to put on the mantle? Probably not - but that isn't the point... the point is that you are going to have fun.  I can see this as being really fun to do with your kids if they are kind of craft/artsy. I know as a kid, I would have loved doing stuff like this.  So what removes this place from a 5-star? Price and music. Just to come in it is $8 per person and then whatever the cost of the pottery piece you pick. It is a little pricey, but meh, this isn't the place you are going to be making a full dinner set. The in-store music was kind of bleh as well. It may be advisable to come with an MP3 player or something and just zone out in your own music instead of whatever random stuff is playing on their radio.  This is somewhat of a side note, but make sure that you give yourself enough time to paint. Every place you paint has to be painted with 3 coats... and if you have a large piece, then that is going to take forever. Furthermore, if you are planning on something intricate/complicated... just remember that you are going to have to do the exact same design three times. It is more difficult than it seems.  Overall, it was fun. I'd like to go back. you can also get their cards and get discounts. Also, look online for coupons. You can get $2 off the sitting-fee or something like that.

I came in about 15mins before closing. I hate doing that, but I was hungry and I can eat fast (hey, I was in the military!)  The food was pretty good. I was a little scared that it would take them a while since it was close to closing but they got it out in a jiffy and it was well made. I even liked the veggies, which is good considering that I am picky with my veggies.

I had the Five-O, aka the Vegetarian's Nightmare. It was a good sandwich!  What I didn't like was that I felt all confused about ordering and picking the food up. I also couldn't hear what they were asking me over the music (which, BTW, I liked the Drum & Bass).  Will I be back? Sure!

I love this place. I could almost just go for the warm rolls with cinnamon butter (I know, that sounds stupid but just you wait).  I personally really like the ceasar salad there. I like lots of dressing and TR does this well.   If yelp got with the program this place would get a 4.5/5 star rating.

Honestly, I feel like many of the reviewers are a bunch of haters. The singrs can't sing? I felt that they did a miraculous job, especially for a crowd that was as enthusiastic as a bowl of dead frogs. All of them in my opinion were great singers. I actually found myself envying them - they get to play their instruments, sing, and crack jokes and make people laugh every weekend... and during the week they put in hard work out on the ranch. To me, they live life while the rest of us go to work and then spend a lot of our time killing our couch springs by watching Jersey Shore garbage (I don't watch TV, thanks). Were they some sort of 5-star band that should go on tour? No. But they were genuine - they had fun, and they were lively. And truth be told, I'm not even into the song and dance type shows.  The food was pretty tasty, but not something I couldn't whip up myself. Pretty basic, but I was full with what I got. I think everyone was in the same boat. No hungry people at my show. For the price I think I got a deal (food plus show). If the food was more of something to write home about, I'd bump the review up to 5 stars.  As for the religious tone that others mentioned yes there was a prayer before serving the food. Now, I've been ALL over the board on religion - so much that I don't even know where I stand today. There might have been a time where I was offended at a prayer... but I found it to be low key, short, and tasteful. To me it actually added to the genuine demeanor of these people. They prayed and so they shared that part of their life and belief with you. You weren't forced to bow your head, pray, or say Amen before getting your food. They didn't ask God for you to repent - they just thanked God for having nice people to eat with. Religious or not, what can you find wrong with someone thanking you for being there and spending part of your life with them as a friend? I was honored.  The only thing I can truly knock the place for is that the bartender gal was slow as molasses and hard of hearing. We asked for XYZ and she totally forgot half the order and moved on despite that we were still standing there. It took her a long time to  realize that we were standing there because she never finished our order out. I suppose we could have hollered at her but I'm just too mild mannered and laid back to say something.  Last but not least, the gun show at teh end was pretty cool. Maybe not for the young kids as the guns are loud... but I liked the show because it was funny... and I like guns. :)

I have never went here alone to eat a pizza. Why? Because 3 grown men couldn't even finish off a pizza.  The pizza is thick and they don't really screw around with skimping on the toppings. Sure, they charge you for it (as someone else said), but I've never seen anyone claim that they were "jipped" for the amount they got.  You can also get pasta but I've never ventured that route because I cannot walk in here and stray from what I know is going to leave me with my mouth watering after I order it. I've taken a few other new people here and they all liked it.  If I could, I'd give it a 4.5 stars...

My original review was in 2010 so it is time to update!  The place looks exactly the same - no changes there which is fine. It still seems like the same family operated business, which is good.  The TV is on with the Olympics on, YES!  So nothing here has changed. I still love the pizza. I did get a normal crust this time which wasn't as much as the Sicilian. The Sicilian was a total beast of a pizza - still I'd vote fit for a group of men.  The four stars on this place remains! Not the absolute best pizza I've ever had, but one of the best in my neck of the woods!

A self-serve car wash, in my mind, is generally someplace that you take a car that is beyond dirty, the automatic car-wash people denied you, or you just want to spray someone with the high pressure washer.   With that said, the car wash does what it is supposed to do. Pump in some quarters and wash away!  I sprayed down the engine with my own goodies to help. Maybe this isn't allowed, but who's going to stop me?

I like coming here in the morning and having a breakfast burrito and then going outside and sitting in the morning sun.  It is nice too, if you happen to prefer a coffee or tea instead of a juice with your breakfast burrito then you can go next door to Starbucks and get that.  Is this place super styling? No. But I like it. Simple. Order food. Get it. Eat it. And then you are off to your next Yelping location.  Maybe next time I should try one of their non-breakfast burritos!

I came in when my kitty, Heiko, dislocated his elbow. I called early in the morning (around 1am) and left a message saying that I'd like to get in that day. They called me as soon as they got in the office (730am) and made an appointment for that same day.  I got in and the staff was nice and helpful.  As others have said, Dr. Chen is a little quirky, but who cares?  A few negative notes are as follows - I had to have 2 x-rays done on Heiko. The first one was indeterminate. The second one was more explicit. However, while I think of myself intelligent and in tune with anatomy (humans and animals, at least in general) I could not for the life of me understand what Dr. Chen saw in the picture. I didn't doubt that he knew something was wrong, but being the cynic that I am, I wanted to understand what exactly was up. I didn't so I had to just take his word on it. Secondly, he prescribed my cat Metacam.  In the past the makers of Metacam prescribed it to cats and dogs alike. But recently they pulled the suggested use for cats. Dr. Chen called them and they still said it was OK for cats, but at a lower dose than for dogs. When I went to the surgery room at Southwest Veterinary Surgical Service Dr. Enwiller suggested that I don't give him the Metacam, but instead the Buprenex. She explained to me that the makers of Metacam pulled the suggested use on cats because they saw cats start having kidney failure while on Metacam. Maybe I shouldn't fault Dr. Chen as Metacam used to be used for cats... but at the same time when he saw the suggested use for Metacam on cats disappear, I would have hoped he found out exactly why.  With that said I did get a big bottle for the price of a little bottle because he was out. But still, that is irrelevant when it is something that may harm my pet. I'm pretty laid back, but I can see some people getting pretty pissed if they found out something like this.  Does all that make me not want to take my pet here again? Nah. I liked it there.

To be honest... I have no idea what these low reviewers got when they came here because I received 5-star all around. After I left I actually felt bad for not leaving more of a tip - it was that good.  I didn't expect much but the food came out lightning fast and it was very good. The service was amazing with the fella working came out to see how we were doing and even offered to put the unfinished ice-cream (that the kid didn't eat) back in the freezer while we ate.

Targets, just like Walmarts, are pretty much copies of each other. Meaning, if you know one store, then the next Target is going to be very similar. This Target is no exception.  What is there to like? Well, I actually kind of like the lack of self-checkouts. for granted, they are kind of cool when in a rush but many we as humans sure are disconnected anymore. We can't even be bothered by waiting in line and talking to someone when they check us out? C'mon, people. This is a nice change of pace in comparison to other stores. I also like that for the most part, the carts aren't trashed. They are generally clean and don't have mounds of trash in them like other stores (not just talking about Walmart here). It is also across the street from the Chandler Fashion Mall. So if you want to kick your scantily clad teenage girl off at the mall and then skip over to target, then this is perfect. Also, it is located in a strip that isn't plagued with empty stores. to my knowledge, every shop in the strip-mall is occupied. This doesn't really matter *to* Target, but it makes the place look nicer. Plus, it gives you a lot more options to get all your daily tasks done as Costco is behind it, Bed Bath & Beyond is next door, as is a sporting good store and a office store.  What is there to not like? They are probably a little more pricey and selective on certain things. However, I have found some tremendous deals here... you just have to look around sometimes. With that said, the quality is probably better than Walmart, so, you get what you pay for.  Overall, it's good. hopefully this location doesn't get too much business stolen from it with the new target on Arizona and Ocotillo.

Kona to me is the trendy Scottsdale bar that isn't in Scottsdale. Everyone dresses up and gets all fancy to get their sushi on. Fish swim around and watch you eat their friends, which is kind of sad. Good food. OK service.

My normal lanes are the Tempe Village lanes (US60 and Rural). However, this one is closer to my house and I go when I just want to work on my game.   I like these lanes, for some reason better than the TV lanes. Maybe it is fresher oil? Not sure but I have my two highest games scored here.  No comments on the food, but seems like the normal food.  I also like the bowling pro shop here.

The Keg to me is the middle ground when it comes to steaks. They are less expensive than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse. Likewise their steaks are less tasty than Durant's/Fleming's but more expensive than Outback/Texas Roadhouse.  With that said, each of the aforementioned places has their positives and negatives. Durants is really pricey but they very well may have the best steak in town to go along with their interesting atmosphere. You can cowboy it up at Texas Roadhouse where throwing peanut shells on the floor is allowed/encouraged. Fleming's is that classy place where you have a whole slew of wines to chose from to have with your supper.  So to take it all in and get the happy medium I think that is The Keg. The steaks are really good there. I would put them on par with Fleming's but obviously not as expensive. Neither myself or the girlfriend has had a complaint about the steak there. The price isn't too hateful there either. And the atmosphere can be as good or better than Fleming's depending where you are. The only thing Fleming's is going to have over the Keg in service is that at the Keg you will have one server that handles everything. Versus Fleming's where you very well may have three servers - one for drinks, one for orders, and one for food (you may not, but I've had special people come and only pour wine, etc). Fleming's isn't quite at the Delmonico's level (Vegas) as far as service.  Really, for the money I think the Keg is the best. Food is great as is service. If you sign up with them then you get deals on occasion (like your birthday, free meal).

So if you like to (seriously) cook or bake then this is the place to go. They have all sorts of professional cooking/baking goods that places like BBB will not have... Like the professional Bosch cooking tools (mixers, grinders, etc).  I can't say much for the place as I've only been there once to buy my mixer... however one of my friends is seriously into cooking loves the place. They also have cooking classes all the time and I think a lot of them are free but are subject to availibility.

If you want to bring your mutt, your pesky feline (I mean that in the most endearing way - I've always had 1 or more cats in my house!), or even your show-worthy cat/dog you are probably going to be turned away from this place. This is an exotic pet clinic meaning bring in all your reptiles, pigs, parrots, and rabbits.  Oddly enough can you guess what I brought in? A cat. Not any cat but an F2 Savannah cat so she is 25% wild. She is probably at the far end of what they will accept at the clinic. The first time I brought in my cat everyone that worked there said they had never seen a cat come into their clinic.  With that said before you bring in your dog or cat call them and see if they will accept it - we did and still amost didn't get in.  I adopted/resuced my Savannah from someone that could no longer take care of her. She is far from a lap cat and would probably rather be sitting hidden in a secret perch near the apex of my house spying on anyone that walks by than sitting on the floor. With that said she has been through two families and we had no idea what she had seen or been through. We did notice that she had some discharge coming from her mouth as to what the previous owner said was allergies. We wanted to verify this claim so we brought her in to see Dr. Todd.  Well, besides her being 25% wild she acted like she had never been to a vet. She pretty much freaked out and wreaked havoc in the examination room. The only option she left us with was to knock her out... via a blow-dart. Holy crap! Once she was out Dr. Todd got to work on her and found that she had a bad infection in her lower jaw that had rotted all her teeth out. They literally fell out when he touched them. Now she is on some antibiotics for 3 weeks to kill off her lower jaw infection.  Long story short I don't think that another vet could have done what they did there. I mean, how many vet offices do you know that have blow-darts much less have used them? Probably none. Luckily he has experience with wild cats - he used to be the doctor for that crazy guy on the Tiger Next Door documentary (check it out). Hitting a cat with a blow-dart was probably tame to what he has seen, honestly.  I've been back there twice now (initial and followup) and the second time he didn't charge me for the visit since he didn't feel there was any real benefit of taking her out of the carrier. She is eating and behaving as normal as she can so there wasn't a reason. I felt this was a good call and it was greatly appreciated that the visit didn't show up on my bill (just picked up the new lot of medicine).  On a separate note, I also like everyone there. Working with different animals seems like an awesome and rewarding experience... at least much more than sitting in a cubicle and having your superiors demand paperwork just to have them take your name off and put their name on your work.

I'm picky about textures of food that I eat so it is surprising to me that I'd like sushi as much as I do.  I've eaten sushi all over the place. I am confident in saying that I like Mikado the best. Their rolls are good sized (some places have really small rolls!) and taste great. The chefs are great too.  Almost every time I've gone I've had someone sit next to me that is a regular and swears by Mikado sushi.  So what is the bad? Sometimes when you walk in the staff is not super active at seating you. If you want to sit at the bar, then just walk over and sit down. If you want a seat then walk over to the register (it is only like 15 feet from the door in plain sight) and ask if it is OK if you sit at whatever booth/table you like. The staff all works together so when you sit at a table you will be served by all the chefs and all the servers - and thusly you will be tipping all of them collectively. So for this reason, it really doesn't matter where you sit! I'm not saying to just sit wherever, I'm just saying be proactive. It helps you and it helps them.  My favorite roll is the Crunch Roll, which you can get for cheap during happy hour (until 6pm). During HH I can get 2-3 rolls and a tea for about $12. Outside of HH it will be more like $18-20. Also, the menu has pictures of all their food (well, 90% of their food), so you can kind of browse that way too if you like to look at what you are buying.  So if you want to be waited on hand in foot and have a restaurant that looks like a million dollars then this is not the place for you. However, if you want good sushi, then this is the place. If you are curious about something, then ask them what they think. I see many of the regulars asking all the time what is fresh and good and the chefs will be very honest about what is good and bad and they will order/serve accordingly. Also, the most you come the more you will become "family" to them. You will start to get samples, especially if you sit at the bar and chat with the chefs.  There you have it... the best sushi place I've been too and better yet, it is close enough for me to walk to!

Have you ever walked into a place of business and you feel like you walked in the back door that the employees use... or maybe before the place was officially open for the day but the door was unlocked? Well, that is how I felt when I walked in here. I don't know if everyone was just busy working on a project or just a bad day but that is how I felt that day.  Now when they finally did realize I was there I asked them if they had what I wanted. They did not so I took off so I don't have a TON of stuff to say about the place. I just felt that the place catered to BMX type bikes and I was that idiot that walked in that didn't know **** about bikes and was wasting their time. Oddly enough, at the time I was quite into biking.  My experience here is being compared to Performance Bike.  But then again, maybe they were closed and I walked in the wrong door?

I see other people calling this a dive bar, to which I disagree with. To me a dive bar is a place to go and drink for cheap and there is very little else to do than drink (maybe pool, an old juke box, or shuffleboard).  To me, Sidelines is a sports bar... hence the sports reference in it's name.  I'll be honest, I really don't like Sidelines. Every time I walk in I feel like I'm not wanted. I've gone when it's busy, when it's dead, alone, with a group, when an event is on, and when nothing is going on. I feel like the staff just doesn't really care if I am there. I feel like I am in Scottsdale where if I am not belching and acting like a total jackass, I will get no service.   The food has never wow'd me. Not at all. Ever.  Sure the screens are nice to watch some events on... but I'd much rather got to Zipps or tilted Kilt to watch.

Who doesn't love a little Arbys. Their window is probably one of the slowest around... but who cares. Are you really needing your food in 3 seconds?  Nah...  PS - I dream about the loaded potato bites!

WHAT!? First off, why have I not left a review for this place. After all, it was Yelp that helped me find this supa-dupa-awesome office. Secondly, if you are looking for a new dentist, I HIGHLY suggest this award winning (litterally) dental office!  My history: My experience with the dentist hasn't been bad. I don't have many-to-any dental problems besides the fact that, like everyone else, I don't floss enough. I come from Ohio, where the waiting list always seems long to get in. Maybe, that was just one office.  In the middle of the Summer of 2011 I started having bleeding gums. Not just when brushing, but just gushing out (I know, graphic). I tried to tough it out, especially since I had an appointment with them about a week later. I woke up with massive blood clots in my mouth and so I called them at like 2am asking them to see if they could fit me in that same day.  They called me back as soon as they got into the office and said they had a cancelation for later that day to which I agreed to. I went in and it was quick and easy. I remember my mother filing out tons of paperwork but this was easy. Maybe times have changed a lot since then?  In any case, they got me in, and out, quickly when I arrived. They did a smal little clean for the area (I had a popcorn hull that had seriously impaled my gums) and signed me back up for a deeper and more extensive clean a few weeks after that. I did that, and even though they did a deep clean, they did a normal clean because I didn't need a deep clean.  Since then I've had one other routine cleaning and I love it here. It is effortless.  Bonuses - they give you nice little shades to wear so that you're not blinded by the lights. Secondly, if there is an issue, they will take pictures of it and show you on the TV screen in full glory. You REALLY get the message then.  I've dealth with Amber, Mary, Kathy, Kaysie, and Dr. Tom.

I'm still going to CDH and still love it. I just want to update my review from a few years ago to say that nothing has changed! They even found my first official cavity :( and took care of that for me without much of an issue.  This place is so professional that it almost makes me sick. Ha! They are great fun and the reviews show it - how many dentist offices do you know that have people that go out of their way to submit a Yelp review? Much less all reviews being 5-star reviews!

I've gone here three times and each time with a different group. I have never ate here so I'm reviewing on games and booze.  First off, I think every time I've walked in the door I was greeted with two things - a bouncer checking IDs and a nice strong whiff of beer. Hello, if you didn't already know it... you're in a bar.  The place is kind of broken in to 3 parts - a bar, a restaurant, and a game room (billiards, ping-pong, darts, video games, air hockey, shuffleboard, etc.). I've played them all and I've enjoyed all the games. This is a pretty good place to just mess around with friends and BS and quite honestly this kind of reminds me of bars in Ohio where I'm from, albeit a bit more upscale since there is more. There is a lot of pool tables, so I would say that if you did have to wait, you wouldn't have to wait long. There is at least 4 tables.  I don't remember my bill total, but generally I get here and just play games or only have one drink. So I can't really even comment on the pricing.

I come here every Thursday to bowl with friends. I am not on a league or anything, just some guys tossing balls down the lane.  The staff is cool (they better be cool since we come every week AND bring people with us).   The bar is fairly decent and so is the kitchen. The lanes are nice.  The Bad: I like to consider myself somewhat serious. I am not the best bowler by any means. However, since this location is close to ASU it seems to attract the jock-straps who think it is cool to shot-put a 6lb ball half way down the lane at 35mph. I cannot stand this. Not only does it fawk up my concentration but it damages the lanes. Besides, it makes you look like a douche (well maybe not to your plastic girlfriend).  Overall, permitting I can get in a lane far away from the McDouches, I have a good time... alone or with a party.

I'm not much of a dive bar person. However, the place is rather interesting. It has that "old bar" feel where people come there to just relax.  Heck, you can even chat with the bartender - try that in Scottsdale! There was even a chick that was there at the bar reading a book. Talk about chill.  Is this a place I'd go out of my way to attend? Is it a place I'd go if I lived close? I'd say so!   Also to note... I was actually confused at the bill. three drinks and my bill was like $8. $8 for three drinks... which in comparison would probably barely buy me one drink in Scottsdale. With that said, if you plan on buying LESS than $10 in drinks/food... then you gotta pay CASH.

This is a review of just a casual trip to B-dubs as well as camping out and watching an Ohio State Buckeyes game.  YES! This is an Ohio State Buckeye backer bar. And in a way, it is a B1G bar. But make no mistake about it, the Buckeyes come first.  In general their food is pretty good. I think their wing quality has gone down in that they are more-or-less wings with your sauce of choice splashed on them. This is OK, so long as you know this is what you are getting.  If you go with children be sure to see if they have any of their gaming systems available. They are good to keep the kids entertained while you eat or watch a game.  As for the Buckeye backer bar, I think this is one of the best places to go. I have gone to Bottled Blonde and while BB goes all out to cater to us Buckeyes, I found it lacking. Sure, the alumni association is there, but that is good or bad. Good if you are an alumni, bad if you are not. At B-dubs there are plenty of chairs/tables to sit at and everyone is friendly. I also REALLY like that they have raffles and drawings the entire game. Literally, I think every time I have watched a game here and it is a big game when they do drawings... I have won something.  And I am someone that NEVER wins anything in life.  The only thing that is bad is that since the Wolverine B-dubs closed, they now come to the Buckeye B-dubs and watch the games. This makes for some interesting tensions since we are huge rivals.

I had to go here to sign the kiddo up for baseball. Before we went, he told me that he didn't like Peter Piper. Whatever, kid, I know better than to believe that EXTREMELY large pile of bologna! You're 5 and your life revolves around playing, napping, and eating snacks, and playing some more!!!!!  Ahh to be a kid again!  Anyways, while we were there I figured why not eat? We got a pizza and he got a free pizza (from school). With our pizza we took the survey on the receipt and got 10 free tokens. BOOYA! Well, booya for about 2 minutes - 10 tokens are blown away enough just to wet the appetite of a 5yr old.  Needless to say, he didn't eat his pizza. He was too flabbergasted to even know what he was doing. In fact, if I had to guess his vision was something akin to someone taking Estacy. I mean... flashing lights, kids running around like they are on cocaine, and most importantly... he wanted to spend MY money.  I kid you not, I'm turning into my mother every day. I never understood why my mom said no to me having fun. Well, it is because the particular type of fun I wanted her to invest in was EXPENSIVE. I mean, $20 for tokens will get you about 15 tickets which will get you a $0.05 Tootsie Roll from the prize department.  I'll tell you what, kid, you sit there and enjoy your pizza and be thankful that you arent still sitting in the car waiting on me... the sheer act of letting you into such an establishment is a gift itself. Since you want to play video games... and eat candy... how about this... how about we roll over to Sam's Club and get a 5lb bag of candy... and you can go home and play whatever game you want on whatever console you want (spoiled kid has access to a XBOX360, a PS3, a Wii, and a computer - I had 5 Nintendos TWO YEARS AFTER the Super Nintendo came out because nobody wanted the NES system anymore!).  But of course today that isn't cool. He wants to have fun. I lost - mom bought him more tokens. *sigh* I guess I'm the bad guy again.  On a serious note the pizza wasn't bad (and the kid claims that PP Pizza is the best now, again, whatever) but the tables were filthy. I guess I kind of expected that though.

I went down here for the car show Motoring Thru Time. I had never really been to Heritage Square (once before to participate in the Zombie Walk) but was really impressed by it. Very clean and of course I loved the cars. I felt like I should have dressed up in some 1920s attire or something.

The days of gay bars only being for gay people are quickly fading into the past. While the bulk of the patrons will indeed be gay, I'd probably call you a liar if you told me that there were no straight people in the house on any given night.  The word on the street is that gay bars are fun places AND that they pour strong and cheap. And this word is true!  If you are looking for somewhere to dress to the nines, spend $500 on a bottle of vodka, show up in a stretch limo, or stay in your personal bubble... this is not the place for you. Nothing is fancy here and you dressing up will only make you a beacon to be gawked at. I have no idea if there is even bottle service here. You'd look like a goose if you showed up in a limo. And you are pretty much guaranteed to be approached.... and possibly touched/groped/fondled while here. Your mileage may vary on that last one.  This is a dive bar. You will see partial nudity (maybe full). You will be beckoned and oogled. During the summer, you probably will sweat when inside. For the most part everyone is super friendly and just letting it all hang out.   Drink specials are the bomb. $3 mini-pitchers on Wednesday? I'm not sure where you can beat that at.

WTF was that!? Did someone bring a f'n cannon to the range?! Good chance!  I've seen a little of everything here - rifles, revolvers, handguns, black powder, shotguns, fully-automatic guns, benchrest guns.... and I've heard something that I am pretty sure was a cannon. They also have a slew of programs and classes for you to join if you are so inclined for those type things.  The main range is nice... but I really like the sport clay range the best!   The range-officers have always been friendly with me, but I'm sure that they could get on your wrong side real quick if you did something wrong.

I have a few places that I like to take out of town guests and Guedo's is on that list. I'll be brief.  PROS: - Good food. - Generally fast for making on the fly  CONS: - Cash only (*** UPDATE: they now accept credit cards) - Small portions (Guedo's burrito and tostadas are probably best bang for the buck) - Weird hours. Even the outside bar closes early and is closed on Sunday and Monday.  To keep the price down I normally order 1 guedo burrito and 1 tostada and 1 small drink. you can have them refill your drink if you want, for free. This combination seems to be the best bang for the buck for me.

I recently had an issue with my cat, Heiko, where he needed to have his elbow fixed.  See: http://www.yelp.com/biz/pride-animal-hospital-chandler#hrid:iWYZtW8yfDP6ptvcnK6L6A  I was referred to SVSS. After I left Pride Animal Hospital, I called and made an appointment for early the next day, 6:30am to be exact. This is perfect for me since I work night shift and with 6:30 I could just get off work and go straight there instead of staying up half the day when I was normally sleeping.  I met with the assistants and Dr. Tara Enwiller. I loved all of the staff, including the front-desk. They were very thorough and Dr. Enwiller was very helpful in describing what had happened, whereas Dr. Chen was unable to.  They brought out the two estimates (closed re-set of dislocation or the open surgery). They explained all the risks and everything to me.  Aside from the seemingly simple procedure costing a lot, it was painless. I actually opted for the more costly provedure, which I had to put 70% down. But, I said they were to just do the less costly procedure. Then I left for home, slept, and picked him up when I was done.  The post-op debriefing was also well done. I need to go back here soon to see if I can get his cast fixed (not their fault).  So, I think this place is top notch. My cat has a cast on with an awesome looking fish decal on it and he seems happy with no pain. I will chalk that up to a good clean procedure.

Had my car towed from my work to my mechanic - the distance was 9 miles and the bill was $113. I['m no expert on prices, but I think other companies are cheaper than this.  With that said, they were prompt, courteous, and well communicated.

This place is in a slightly odd location but is worth going out of the way for! It has an old-midwest diner feel. Friendly staff. Good food. Decent prices.  I got the egg-salad wrap and man was it good. The deep friend mac-n-cheese was also heavenly!  Will be back!

Martini-Ranch is another club that is two clubs in one, kinda. Sometimes they have two stages going with two different types of music. They also have art shows here too, so they can really mix it up. With that said, I kind of like Giligans more for the dive type atmosphere and for a more club atmosphere something else in the area.  It may be a great place of comprimise for a group since sometimes it is super hard to get everyone to agree on a place.

After my failed attempt at the Blind Pig I jumped over to Sal's. After all, it looked like they were being attended to... and eating. Something that wasn't being done at the Pig.  When we walked in I thought we had walked in the back door - kind of, not really a normal hostess table. As it turns out this place was reservation only at least on the night we went. Even so, they checked their availability and sat us anyways. This took about 2 minutes to be seated despite our lack of reservations.  Within 5 minutes I had an adult beverage in my hand. If this was the Blind Pig then at this time I was still waiting on the sidewalk wondering if anyone was going to seat me. Night and day my friends.  So the service was good. And not just because the Blind Pig was terrible (read my review for that). They were good at seating us and the server was awesome.  The atmosphere was nice too. I'd call it casual romantic. Lights down, but families were there. Checkered table cloths instead of starched white.  Food was awesome too. Date and I shared a blanco pizza and each had a Caesar salad. I also got crab cakes as an appetizer. The Caesar was amazing, BTW. This sounds odd but I go out and searching for good Caesar salad. I've even went all the way to Vegas to try a salad someone suggested (OK I didn't make a special trip, but I did put it on my list of places to try when I went a few weeks later). This place's Caesar is for sure in my top three. If it tells you anything my other two are in Vegas and Prescott.  Anyways. The table bread was good. The crab cakes were great (wonderful sauce to compliment it). The salads were on point. And the pizza was demolished. The staff was accommodating and gracious. The patio was warm. Win. Win. Win.  Thanks Sal. Next time I promise to bypass the Blind Pig and just make a reservation with you!

All I can say about this place is that this place is fast but I think that is because they don't put meat on their sandwiches. Maybe this was just a product of coming in there at 10PM?  If you're looking for meat, go to Firehouse Subs. If you're looking for a lettuce on a bun, come here!

I met a friend here by their choice to get some grub and to watch some games. In short - I was neither impressed or disappointed. The food was good and the prices were fair. If I had to complain about anything it was that the TVs were too high/too far away/too small. I guess I'm used to some of the monster screens that are at other sports bars.  I didn't get into the bar area so I can't comment on that - or on their drink specials. I did get the vibe that this could be a pretty cool local/neighborhood bar if you happened to live close by (I live 30 min away).

I'm not sure how I've checked in 6 times here but never reviewed this place. Oh yeah... this place is a BAR. And generally the next day I am hungover and don't want to review someplace.  So why am I always hung over after this place? Well, their drinks are strong - namely their Long Islands and AMFs.  Almost every night I've went here I've blacked out or nearly blacked out - especially if I get ahold of 2 or more of those drinks. Even in my drinking prime I couldn't handle them - and LIs and AMFs were *my* drinks!  I actually have an ongoing challenge with my friends that go out with us that if they can drink 5 or more LIs or AMFs from Cue in the course of the night of Mill bar hopping that they win a prize. Nobody has taken me up on that offer.  I'm now thirsty.

If you are looknig for a hookah guru then you'd be better off going with my Yelp friend Taric below. I am a complete amateur and barely have any knowledge of when to do what when it does it's thing.   With that said, I have hookah'd enough to get by and have some fun.  The first thing I noticed was that the staff genuinely seemed to like doing their job. The second thing I noted was that the place was dead - like nobody at all there- when we arrived at 8:30pm.  We ordered the Pandora's Box which was one of their customer favorite's. Fruity. The two people that I went with thought it was too fruity. I liked it but then again I am the guy who thinks that Long Islands and Pink Panty drinks are heavenly  Like Taric mentioned below, they did have a hard metal screen, which I kind of liked over the aluminum foil. I need to check into that when I get my own hooka.  In all, I liked the place. It was a little blah on the eyes, but nice. My only other references to hookah are in-home and Harem. Which, Harem sucks something horrible. I hate that place. I am giving Red Sea a 4 star because I think the smoke room could use a touch of improvement (no metal office chairs, etc).

How in the world does this place only have two reviews!? This pace is on Mark Salem's "best of" list for Phoenix Transmission shops and they treated me like a queen... I mean a king here.  First off, I am a bumbling idiot. I made my appointment online. Boom, got confirmation and immediately had to change it to the day after. Done without an issue. Then the day comes and I lose my wallet and had to cancel. I rescheduled and then dropped my car off at night (that is the only time I could have two vehicles) the following day before my 9am appointment. Or so I thought.  As I got home I for some reason looked at my appointment confirmation and realized that my appointment was on Monday, not Friday. Damn. Oh well, it is already there and the key is in the drop-box already so I can't do anything about it now! I left a message saying that if they couldn't get it in to just call me and I would get it as soon as I could get back out there.   I found a friend to come get me all the way out in Northern Tucson (just kidding, but I am at the southernmost tip of Chandler) and drop me off at the shop. I talked to the guys at the shop and they said they couldn't find anything wrong with the transmission but they would like me to take it for a spin to see if I could point out what the issue was. I got there and took one of the fellas for a spin and nope... nothing. This was my girlfriend's car so I was a little "out" of trying to diagnose what she felt. We talked a bit about how transmissions age and when things are a real problem versus just a nuisance.   In a nut-shell, they were just real straight up with me. At the end of the drive around the block they said they couldn't feel anything so they couldn't charge me. Couldn't charge me? Um, you did take my vehicle in and you did spend time trying to figure it out so I owe you something. Nope. They wouldn't accept it. Who the heck runs a business like that in 2014?  I'll tell you who does - a damn good one.  And it isn't just me... look at the other reviews here! They too didn't feel like they were getting upsold or talked to like little kids. This shop is as legit as they come in my opinion. IMHO, if you have a problem with your transmission then this is the place to go without question.

Sometimes I really wonder what my fellow Yelpers are really reviewing. What do they want Fat Tuesday's to be - a gormet bar that sprinkes magic dust into your drink that helps you get laid? C'mon peeps, judge it for what it is.  As others have said, this place's main thing is their wall of frozen booze. I feel like I'm in a Quick-Trip ordering a drink. Well, until I eat that damn Atomic Cherry that has been soaking in Everclear and I sip my drink that is heavily diluted with some alcohol. then I quickly realize that if I am going to drink two or more of these things... I might want to call a cab or I'll be getting pulled over by a horse cop as I exit Mill Ave.  Is it a dance club? Sure, it has a dance floor. But I like to think of it more as a place to watch people who have had 2 too many slushies try to shake it (all in good fun of course, because I've done it). This isn't no Rain night club of Vegas, people.   What's good? No cover. People come and go so there is always someone new to talk to or watch. Outside area is a blast to sit and drink and people watch the people of Mill. Bartenders are lightning quick and make my drinks very well.  I love this place. What is there not to love unless you are looking for Scottsdale glamour.

I have taken clothes in to sell to them about twice. I don't think I've had them accept any of my clothes (hmpf!).   I guess I dress like Grover.  With that said, I love shopping here. If you are patient and like ruffling through numerous racks and trying on random clothes for a few hours, this is your place. You can score some really cool clothes for cheap if you stick to it.  I also like that they offer tokens-for-bags (or whatever it is called). You can have your clothes put in a plastic bag or just carry your clothes out in your hands. If you chose the latter, they will give you a "donation token" to put in a little bin. Your token will go towards some sort of charity. Super cool if you ask me - and I'm far from an eco-hippy.

The place is good. Think of it as going to your neighbor's BBQ. This place isn't gourmet, but who cares. It taste like normal food over the standard commercialized food, which is an awesome change of pace.  The only thing I'd change is the amount of food. I got a Guac cheeseburger and fries and went back for a little one... and STILL was hungry. Ha!

Seriously, over 1400 reviews? There isn't much I can say that isn't already said. I'm not a pizza snob either - there are very few pizzas that I dislike (even the frozen Totino's I like).  With that said, the pizza was good. It had a fresh feel to it. Kind of like it was homemade on the spot.  I sat outside so I got to hear the hosting and it seemed like people were having to wait a lot, even if they had reservations. Guess being popular is a good problem!

I took the lady here for our 1yr anniversary after hearing good things about it. She actually wanted to go to the Melting Pot since that was where we had our first date at - but hey, I'm the man here right? And I say that we are trying something new!  Entering the door and going through the kitchen is different... and weird. If I hadn't read about it here on Yelp then I would have thought I walked in the wrong door. The girlfriend still swore I was lying and I pulled a fast one on her. Even after seeing people come and go through the kitchen, she was still skeptical! LOL. It is a nice touch though - my comment was "it makes it a bit harder to spit in your food with customers walking through all the time, huh?"  I know, the way I think is weird.  The garlic bread was good. I generally don't like a bunch of "crap" on my bread but I actually really enjoyed this bread. I could have made a whole meal out of it (I've heard that from others).  The taters were good as was the steak. The searing+flavoring was phenomenal on both her Filet Mignon and my New York. It was probably one of the better flavorings I've had on a steak to be honest.  I actually undervalued the bill too. I figured I'd be hit with a Delmonico's (Vegas) tab but it wasn't so bad. Service was good too - I drink a lot and my water glass was never empty. My alcoholic drink (Long Island) was also good as well as whatever fruity drink she had. Not too alcoholic, but still very tasty on both drinks.

Meow. I saw my home-team, the Reds, play against the Diamondbacks. We got spanked. No bueno. The experience is always fun though.

I stumbled into Delmonico Steakhouse after going to the wrong place as suggested by my friend. He told me to go to Emeril's in Vegas, so I did. However, the only place that houses Emeril's name is the Fish House.  My friend challenged me that Demonico had the best Caesar salad after I claimed I had found the holy grail. So I had to try it here. First off, they make it from scratch, tableside here. They even have you inspect it before putting salad in.  Previously I thought I had good Caesar salad, but this was on a different level. The salads that I've had before were either good or bad. The flavor was just that. however this salad actually had *waves* of flavor. you could distinctly taste the pepper fade in and out, the egg fade in and out, sardines fade in and out, and other flavors until it mellowed out on your palette. WTF, are you serious? I didn't even know salad dressing could do that. I give the salad a 5/5  My lady and I shared the lamb. I am not a huge lamb eater because I generally find it too fatty and I don't like fatty texture. This was good though and I did enjoy it all. It could have been a little more charred on the outside as I found that part to be the most tasty. I probably would have been better off with something a little more traditional like steak, I suppose. I'll give them lamb a 4/5  For dessert I got this cheesecake that was akin to a smore. It was seriously yum. I was stuffed before I started it, and I still ate it - it was that good. I will give it a 5/5.  What was magnificent with this place was the service. I am very particular with service and how often the service visits your table. I was a little scared at first of this place when they announced that we would be attended by three different people. Of crap I thought, they are going to be down my throat every bite. But really, they worked it like a charm. They came when they needed to and didn't come when they didn't need to come - all three of them. My water was constantly full as well. I really appreciated this.  I want to go back here next time I am in town and do a few things differently. First, don't eat 3 hours before arriving. I was not all that hungry when I arrived and I felt like I was doing myself a disservice. Second, try something more to my liking such as chicken or steak. I have to give it a 4.5 but yelp doesn't allow a half mark. I feel that the main part of the meal was the weakest which is the main reason you are there so I am rounding down to 4-stars. Maybe if I enjoyed the main course a little more (not that it was bad) then I would have given it a straight 5-stars.  I'll be back.

I've been to Axis-Radius about 5 times and have never had a spectacular time. I will list the reasons why.  (1) If you go on the weekend then the place is nasty packed. I am pretty sure that every time a big DJ comes to town they violate fire code by packing as many people as possible in. On one instance, I had bought pre-sale tickets. Upon getting there I waited in line for nearly 2 hours and the line moved about 10 people (who were also presale). All the while, people rolling in and paying door-price-premiums got in. Fuck you Axis-Radius for not letting PAID customers in while you let people willing to pay premium prices to get them and their posse in.   (2) Prices. Drink prices are the highest I've seen. I think a long island (my staple drink) is about $12. Talk about getting raped - this is Scottsdale, not a holiday weekend in Vegas. I will say that I came here one time and they gave my group (5+ people) a FREE bottle of vodka, with bottle service. I guess Thursdays are super slow days for them.  (3) Creeper hell. I am a guy and *I* am weirded out my the creeper groups that seem to plague Axis-Radius. Can't people, especially girls, dance without you and your 4 buddies doing a Night at the Roxbury skit where you surround a girl and don't let her go. It's bad enough where I will step in and act like their boyfriend until the weirdos leave. How creepy.  (4) Trip hazard. I don't know what it is, but I've found more things to trip over in Axis-Radius, sober and drunk. I guess that is extra entertainment.  Bottom line - stay way unless you want to pay a premium to be mobbed... or are just dying to see a special DJ. As for me, I'm done with A-R.

When I go to Mill my circuit is Robbies, Canteen, and then Zuma. If I want to get ripped then I start early at Fat Tuesday's with their slushies and add in Cue clubsomewhere in there with their ridiculous AMFs (or Long Islands).  Zuma, however, is a staple. I know of very few times I have came to mill and not gone to Zuma. Even when I've been the only person in the place... I've gone. Generally if that happens, I order a full Zuma-juice drink and slam it like a shot. Weak, drink, I know, but fun and goes down easy. And remember, I'm by myself so who cares what "everyone" thinks!  The only thing negative that I can say is that at times when it is busy it can be annoying to see the door bouncer letting all his homies in while you wait. Shit, and I even know one of the main barenders and I can't do that. Damnit! My drunk is wearing off.  The place is fun though. Stripper pole in the back (off-limits to guys when it is busy... I found out the hard way, lol). When it is busy half the people are dancing on the tables and booths. I even had a guy throwing dollar bills at the people on the floor like some sort of baller... everyone was too cool to pick up the money so I did and bought some Jack in the Box on the way home.

I've been to Bobby Q's 4 times now and always have gone at Happy Hour. Why? Because it has a nice little menu. Today, two of us ate 3 appetizers and the bill was $14.  This is my go-to spot for West Phoenix (I live in Chandler). Depending on your goal Bobby Q's has it - nice bar, nice restaurant, and nice club on the side.  Club: I've gone to the club twice now on Friday (not sure the hours). Earlier in the night it is rather interesting (in a good way). The way that I describe it as - someone brought in their iPod and put it on shuffle. They play country, hip-hop, rap, alternative, oldies, rock, and disco all in one sitting. This makes for an interesting dynamic as many people who want to dance to Toby Keith's "I love this bar" probably don't want to dance to the follow-up song of Soulja Boy's "Kiss me through the phone."  Except me of course - I stay and dance to whatever is playing.  With that said, the crowd is generally older. I was boogying down with a lady that was 70+ and having a ball. Later in the night (read: after 10pm) the crowd changes to an urban crowd and has a crowd that is complimentary to that music.

First and foremost, I am writing this review as a straight guy who is very LGBT friendly (don't read that as I'm LGBT curious, I simply don't care what your sexual preference is). And in reality, a lot of straight people go to gay bars these days - it's 2013 people!  With that said, I've gone here both with my LGBT friends as well as my girlfriend. I've also always gone on Wednesdays, which have great drink specials. BSW is a great place to dance and if it so interest you, to check out the muscle-ridden underwear-only go-go dancers.  Drinks are strong. In fact, the very first time I went here within 15 seconds of getting in the gate... one dude puked on another dudes shoe. Neither seemed to care - something of which if that happened in a straight club, you would have got your ass whooped, then thebouncers would have thrown you over the fence. I turned to my gay friend and said, "you guys sure are wild party animals."  On Wednesday you buy a drink and they give you chips to spend on drinks later. Gay bars are known for having strong drinks and this place is no different. Any other place in Scottsdale is going to pour you watered down drinks - I know, because I go there too. So needless to say, you get your money's worth here, I feel, on Wednesday.  Parking is mainly in the parking garage, which is pretty plentiful. But if you go later in the night, that garage may be full. But hey, this is better parking than 80% of Oldtown Scottsdale. So get there early, or better yet, cab it there and cab it home.  The last time I was there with my girlfriend and her friends. It was good fun until the end when someone lifted her purse. The friend got a little crazy and upset and blamed us. It is unfortunate that this happened, but I can't nessisarily blame the bar for this act. I did contact BSW the next day and they were helpful.

Although I am not a stadium guru, I would say that University of Phoenix is a great stadium. I have sat in three locations - section 117 (offset behind the goal post), section 102 (right where players exit the locker room tunnel), and section 437 (way up in the corner). Amazingly, my favorite seats of the three would be the section 437!  Now of course, if you are looking to get autographs the best place is down by the player entrance. But if you are wanting to actually watch the game, the 400-seats are the best by far. The problem with the 100-seats are that they are all at a gradual slope so if anyone - and I do mean anyone - stands up in front of you during the game you won't be able to see over them so your options at that point will be to either stand up with them or to watch the game on the big screen. So essentially all 100-seats are standing areas only for the duration of the game.   The 400 seats are more like movie-theater seats. They are at a steeper incline and unless someone stands up right in front of you, there is absolutely no need to stand up.  Also, from the 400-seats you are kind of looking down on the field and thus you can see plays develop. From the 100-seats you can't really see plays happening - this is especially true when the play is running away from you. You can see a bunch of guys running around on the field but you can't see the PLAY. It is slightly better when the play is coming towards you, but not much.  In conclusion, pick your seats wisely and dependent on what you want to do during the game - be close to the players or watch the game. You can't really have both at this stadium. There are websites that allow you to view the seat's view too, so look around for those and they will help you get an idea of how it will look before you arrive.

I like gelato, a lot. I liked it before most Americans had even heard of it. This place was good. Loved it even though they had just recently had one of their freezers break.

I decided to go with the yellow curry so I could compare to other thai places. While I enjoyed it, I felt that I liked Thai Rama's better. I know, blasphemy to the Yupha's faithful.  It was a touch less spicy than Rama, which could be better or worse depending on who you are. It seems like other reviewers have reported slightly more mild flavors too, so there may be something to that. They also served far less rice than Rama. While they will bring you more rice... Rama will bring you a large bowl and repeatedly ask if you want more. Total rice in the original bowl was about 1 cup. Which maybe I don't know how to properly eat thai, but that is far enough for a whole meal of curry.  I also got the crab puffs, which were freaking awesome.  I went with a vegetarian and they felt that their options were limited. If you are a vegetarian and don't want tofu (like my company) then you can ask for more vegetables in place of the tofu if you want.  I'd go back here no problem. I liked it.  Note: beware of having a group of 5 or more. That will warrant an automatic tip added to your bill.

So there are a couple different locations and this is the second location I've been to. Each has it's own decor going on... with this one being much more loungy with big couches and chairs all over the place.  Cool place.  But gelato is to die for. Forget Coldstone and come and get something at least halfway healthy! And better yet, it tastes phenominal.  Plus, you can stand there and bother the workers to get samples of everything they have... if you really wanted to. But, if you are like me, you get tunnel vision and order the same thing every time - Amarena.  OK, I lied. Last time I went I actually tried another flavor - Caramelo.  So now I am in a debacle... because I love both flavors. Maybe this is my chance to break routine and try yet another flavor. Hmmm, we will see... my beloved Amarena calls my name ever so strongly every time I stare through that cold case window.  Alright, I need to get going... to the G-spot!  PS - check in a few times on Yelp and get a coupon and from what I hear Foursquare has a coupon as well!

Get out your Yelp smartphone app... and check-in. You know why? Because every time you do... you will receive a $1 domestic beer. That is a big deal when you are looking to booze it up on the cheap and don't want to get hammered alone in your car. Again, this is EVERY time you check in... not just every 2-3 times like other places.  The food isn't bad. I haven't ate here in a year or so but when I did, it wasn't bad. Now, it's not your 5-star food, but it is pretty good for bar food. And it can be totally on the cheap if you go at the right times. I will have to update when I've had the food more recent.  Now, the people. Honestly the ages range all over the place here. I've seen couples in their 50s come here... and then the I-just-turned-21 crowd. Everyone seems to get along. Fairly good looking staff as well (if that matters to you).  The place. This is kinda dive-bary. Kinda. I personally like it. About a third of it is outdoor and mostly covered. They have heat lamps out there when it is cold. I'm not sure exactly what days... but I've seen beer pong tournaments, spinning wheels for drink specials, and all sorts of wild things happening here. There are a few pool tables even. And the walls are laced with random things to gawk and laugh about. The bathrooms were actually pretty good last time I went, especially for a I-cant-aim-Friday-night-drunk-fest. There was a bathroom attendant there, who was pretty cool - and more dressed up then the Scottsdale clubs I've been to. You sir, are dapper.  Parking. Alright, I hate parking here in Phoenix. Downtown it is a mish-mash and some shady looking places. I never know where to park down there. Scottsdale, you better show up at 7pm, or plan on parking valet. Mill is OK, but you might have to walk a bit. Here, there are essentially 3 fairly good sized parking lots for Iguana's and Dos Gringos (next door). I had no problem finding a spot at 11pm.  Overall, this is a nice little alternative to Mill and Scottsdale. The people are much more down to earth and it is much easier to take a cab home if you need it. Plus, if Iguana's isn't doing it for you... you can always check out Dos Gringos right next door.

Alright, I have a bad habit of coming somewhere and getting the same thing over and over. I never will work through the Dilly menu for the simple fact that I am addicted to the BBQ Chicken, Blazing Buffalo, and if I am feeling quirky the Dilly Bird.  Oh, and I cannot forget about the Wisconsin Cheese Bowl. I nearly inhale the stuff. Today I actually got so excited that I took too big of a bite out of my bread bowl and cheese was spilling all over the place. Clearly... a "food foul" and I was strongly considering licking it off the table. (Yes, it is that good)! I have also heard good reviews of the Boston Clam Chowder.  I can't say much except that I've thoroughly enjoyed every trip I've made to this place.   What is the downfall of the place? For me, that they close at 8pm. And because they are locally owned, they are closed down at random sometimes.

I've drank here about 5x, played games about 6x, and ate here about 4x.   First off - I LOVE THE CHEESE CURDS. They are little greasy nuggets of joy. So if you don't like greasy food, these are the last thing you should order. But dang, they are awesome. :)  So, I like shuffleboard. Enough that I've played for shirts before (of which I won, by the way). When my opponent lost their shirt, Monkey Pants and any other patrons didn't even seem to mind. After all, they have a shirtless shot 1-2x a night anyways so it isn't completely uncommon to see shirtless people in here.  Drinks seem to be reasonable here as well, especially if you order some of their special drinks.  Food is pretty decent as well and I'd put it about one step above bar food in some cases.  I'm not sure how long they have been doing it... but they had a "power saver" night where they wouldn't use lights, but rather candles for their lighting. As stupid as it sounds, I REALLY loved it. The bartenders also dressed up and it ended up feeling like a speak-easy. Speaking of bartenders, they are pretty dang attentive. I think I've received some of the fastest service here.  Overall, I like this place. I wish I lived closer so I could just walk there. I could see this as being my local watering hole.  PS - They have a lot of board games too. So if you're looking to spice things up. Grab an old fashioned board game and have at it!

I do not have a lot of public transportation experience so take this review for what it is worth as I've only ridden a few times... but my experience has always been good. Just so you know where I am coming from I've ridden rail systems in Boston, Philly, Phoenix, and Germany.  I would venture to guess that anyone from a city with a well established public rail system (Boston MBTA, DC Metro, NYC Subways, Chicago L & METRA, Bay's BART, etc) will think that the PHX lightrail is a joke. And to be honest in a way it probably is. However, I would say that it is not all that bad! Phoenix is a huge SPRAWLING city. Just for comparison, NYC is 468 sq miles and Phoenix is 517sq miles (not including suburbs on either). Take into consider population density and you will see that Phoenix drops way-way-way down the list.  What this essentially means for the rail system is that less people live close to the rail/subway than in other cities (comparison, NYC has a population density of 27,779 people per square mile versus Phoenix at 2,797. Yes, NYC is 10x more dense). So to have a rail, any rail, that works, to me, is a feat worth mentioning. Sure, it could be better, but for what obstacles it must overcome to work it has done very well in my opinion.  To put things in even better perspective... in many of the big metro-rail cities... a lot of people solely rely on the rail for transportation. Here in Phoenix I would guess that a higher proportion of people have cars. So people are voluntarily riding here. Furthermore, Phoenix is hot as hell in the summer - so those of us riding voluntarily are waiting for the train in the heat (which I truly think that most Phoenicians are absolutely addicted to their A/C). Not so much in other cities.  The train always seems clean to me. In general, I don't see bums or people masturbating on the cars. The cars are always on time despite having to drive in traffic instead of underground or on suspended rails like other cities.  I mean, I'm not sure what people who vote this system down for? Do you want Phoenix to spend vast amounts of money to bring the train to your suburb where it would only pick up 3 people a day because everyone is in their personal car (again, it is my belief that most Phoenicians will not tolerate waiting for a rail car while standing in the heat). The only thing I wish that the rail had was later hours, at least on the weekends... or maybe a more direct route to the airport.

I was the first person to be picked up. Driver was running early and a text arrived to indicate this. Driver came exactly on time. However, they still were willing to wait until scheduled time. I was ready so we went. Two more people were picked up and off we went. Good conversation while driving so that was good too. Would recommend if you would rather be dropped off curbside and leave car safely at home. It may be more cost effective if you park and ride.

Did multiple trips here during a painting project for my new house. I like the paint center better here than at Home Depot.  Not to be sexist, but if you caompare any hardware/lumber store in terms of manliness then Lowes comes in last. So if you're looking for a place that you can get splinters and grunt about tools, Lowes is more of a hardware/lumber store with a veneer of a fancy showroom. But, maybe I am just old-school and grew up on the wood floors of Ace Hardware where everything is on the shelves waiting for you to knock them off and stab yourself in the foot.

Let us be honest about what DeVry is and is not. DeVry is a fine school if you want to fiddle with some electronics, electronic test equipment, and want a "degree" to attach to your resume. DeVry is not a school that is going to get you some awesome job that allows you to greatly succeed in life.  Let me explain. Out of everyone that graduated with me most people went into the semiconductor field as maintenance technicians of some sort. We use little to no skills obtained at DeVry and the kicker is that you don't even need a degree to be a maintenance technician at a semiconductor plant. This is exemplified by everyone you work with having no college degree... or a degree from DeVry.  So if that is the case, then why in the world would you go to DeVry and rack up a $50k tuition bill?  To make matters worse, DeVry touts themselves as a legitimate university with legitimate degrees. In the real world many businesses don't consider degrees from DeVry (at least the BSEET degree I have) to be a legitimate engineering degree. Furthermore, graduate programs don't consider it a legitimate degree either. For one to carry on to a MSEE at ASU, one will have to step back and take remedial classes to prove that you are at a caliber even worthy of entering a legitimate college program at a legitimate college. Sure, DeVry is accredited, but accreditation is entirely different than legitimacy.  This is my suggestion... if you have any inkling that you might want to continue your education, go to ASU and see if they will directly accept the DeVry degree without making you take remedial classes. If they don't then DeVry might be a valid choice. Otherwise, save yourself the trouble and just go to a school like ASU.  I wish that I had transferred to ASU in my junior year after I found out that the business community didn't view my degree as legitimate as other schools.  EDIT: I used ASU's transfer credit guide (https://webapp4.asu.edu/transfercreditguide/app/home?init=false&nopassive=true) and looked up what transferred from DeVry and here are the results by semester.  SEMESTER 1 (4 of 6 transfer): *COLL 147 *COMP 125 *MATH 150 *PSYC 110  SEMESTER 2 (3 of 7 transfer): *ENGL 110 *ENGL 110L *MATH 155  SEMESTER 3 (3 of 5 transfer): *COMP 215 *ENGL 135 *MATH 215  SEMESTER 4 (1 of 6 transfer): *SOCS 185  SEMESTER 5 (1 of 6 transfer): *ENGL 227  SEMESTER 6 (3 of 7 transfer): *PHYS 210 *PHYS 210L *SPCH 275  SEMESTER 7 (2 of 6 transfer): *PHYS 225 *PHYS 225L  SEMESTER 8 (2 of 7 transfer): *CARD 405 *HUMN 410  SEMESTER 9 (2 of 6 transfer): *ECON 312 *HUMN 432  Grand total of credits that transfer: 21/56 (37.5%)  Please notice that NONE of your CORE CLASSES transfer. The only things that transfer are your freshman math classes, physics, economics, English/writing, public speaking, and electives.

Alright, so I'm a guy and this is not a "guy" place. Sure, I am artsy... but again, I'm better off navigating Home Depot or Lowes.   I came here to check out hot women...  Wait... no, I came here to get some iron on patches. With half the store being cloth reels and a cutting desk, I was pretty lost in finding these little boogers. I ended up having to ask a worker who pointed me directly there.  PS - the women there were attractive. Maybe I need to have more projects.

Water and Ice with 5 stars? Well, I didn't expect it either!  I was packing up for Country Thunder and had my huge cooler in the back seat. I had absolutely no idea how much ice it needed. When we pulled up the owner gave us the rundown of all the sizes and asked what we needed. When we told him we didn't know he handed us a card and told us to load up and then come back and let him know what we used.  WHAT?   Someone let us take product outside without paying for it? Wow. Is this still 2012? The Mayans must be right, the end of the world is near.  I know, I know... it is just ice you say. But, I've never had that happen before at any business. The courtesy made the transaction easy and actually made me feel good about the world again. Thanks Mr.!

I've gone here for a few years. I stop by even if it is not all that busy. Staff is generally nice and quick at the bar. Drinks are tasty and you can act like a fool on the dance floor if you want (I do). The place behind it (now a country bar) definitely overshadows this place. But hey, it is a cluster-f over there and if you want to just relax, chat, and have a few drinks without all the crazy loudnes then this is a good option. Plus, you get to have front-row seats watching all the drunks stumble out (sometimes that is me!).

Like smoothies? THEN GO HERE. End of review. (And if you don't believe me, look at all the other reviews - they are ALL 5-star reviews)  OK, really, this place is awesome. I not only love their smoothies but love the people that work there. I dont come but once a month and both of the main people know me by name, where I work and what I drive. They nearly know my favorites too. Saying it that way kind of makes it sound like they are stalkers or something but what I am trying to convey is that they are some people that GENUINELY care about their customers. And I don't mean that their customers are happy with their smoothie either, I mean that life is going well for them in general.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: 5/5 In an age where most companies are about the bottom line and customer service has declined, this is a super nice thing to have on their resume. I've sat here many times and watched them converse with nearly every single customer that came in. Thanks Tom and Anita!  INSIDE: 5/5 Two tables with 4 chairs each, plus two barstools. Not many stay in there to eat so this is sufficient. ALWAYS clean.  LOCATION: 4.5/5 They are just south of the 202 on Arizona Ave by Sam's Club. I give it a 4.5 because they are probably too south for many people. I live right around the corner, so this is not a problem for me. But make a trip here a lunch run. Go get a smoothie then go over to Sam's Club (with your membership or attempt to sneak in) that is in same parking lot and eat samples for lunch. What could be better in times like this when we could all pinch pennies.  SMOOTHIES: 5/5 Clearly a 6 if I could give it. I've tried all sorts of smoothie places and all the smoothies don't taste as natural as IJ. I trust that this is true on paper too - I believe they ARE healthier than other places. Their menu is pretty diverse as well, to include some of the better wheatgrass I've tried (didn't even really need a chaser). Best yet, with a medium or larger (medium is standard) you get two free supplements. If you don't know, most places charge something like $0.25 per supplement. I also like their Acai Bowl with a passion. I get it with apple juice and it is an absolute treat. One bowl will nearly fill me up so that I can't drink my entire medium smoothie. BTW, Acai is supposed to be SUPER healthy.  OTHER: N/A They have a frequent shopper card. Your 13th smoothie will be free. They also always have coupons and (should) accept the Intel Vault card.  Bottom line is this... if you want a healthy fruit drink then come here. Like Aaron H below said, I refuse to go anywhere else. The place is great and I truly wish more people knew about it.

I love Inta Juice but things have noticeably changed since Tom and Anita sold the place. This is no more evident than in the morning. For whatever reason the morning crew just isnt as speedy, efficient, knowledgeable, or proficient as the old owners. You see, I fell in love with Inta years ago not just because of the smoothies, but also the owners. They always knew my name as soon as I walked in and had many conversations with them about eating healthy and what might give you extra health benefits. Hell, I even started doing wheat grass shots here (they are terrible elsewhere).  I just don't get that vibe with the new owners. And it kind of makes me sad.  I still love the smoothies though.

I recently bought a house. Out with their under-sink reverse osmosis system and in with my reverse osmosis system. Problem was that their water in spigot was the type that punctures the copper pipe coming in from the wall. So what happens? Their little spigot with no hose on it decides it won't fully close. If it won't close then it will drip. I can't simply take off the spigot because that spigot has punctured the line. so, I called City Wide.  They cut off the old copper pipe with the puncture in it and welded a new piece on as well as a new quarter-turn shutoff valve. It cost me $174 which seems high for a small amount of work, but I think it was worth it. The copper coming from the wall wasn't that long and the hole was close to the wall meaning not much room to cut the pipe off or to weld a new sleeve on.   Could I have done it myself? Sure, but eff that... I would have cursed myself for 4 hours and had to go back to Lowes 14 times... and I probably would have burned myself doing all this.  On a different note... here lately I've been trying to fix things here and there and been calling people trying to set things up. It seems the trend is that people are hard to get a hold of and if you do they don't call back. This place I called, they said they'd have someone out in an hour and they came and did their job.

I am writing a review based on my (second) experince with my site-to-store purchase.  Both times I went to the rear of the store where you pick up and hit the little "call" button. As I write now, 15mins have gone by with nobody at attendance. Or maybe I am just going delerious and it has really been 30 mins and I'm just good at entertaining myself on yelp.  Bottom line is - they aren't quick at this desk so don't come expecting a quick jaunt.  UPDATE - I went to the electronics department counter and they helped me out.

CFA is the cadillac of fast-food. They have great food and their service is off the charts in my opinion. They are so nice that it almost makes you feel guilty for having them help you. I guess this is what happens when you get used to other fast food places throwing sub-par food at you with a frown.  But really, get here. I love it. It is my pleasure to submit this review.

What can I say... they are open all night... and they are close to my work.  They do have a few "healthy" options... or a few options that might kill you. If I am going here late at night... I am usually hankering for something that might kill me in my sleep so that is what I get.  Love the fries as well, forget the curly ones as the regular are better.

This is one of the few car washes in this part of town as I think the next closest is Clean Freak Car Wash (not counting the ones at gas stations). I didn't feel like driving that far today so I decided to give Kelley's a try. Not bad.  It has two drive trough car washes, ones where you pump quarters/tokens and do it yourself, and even a full size RV wash. I've never even seen a RV wash, much less an automatic wash so I was impressed. They also have a detail center and a RV dump station (I think $5). So they seemed pretty diverse.  I went through the "soft touch car wash" (far left) and it seemed to do well. The automatic car wash on the right was labeled "quick wash" or something like that and the prices were the same.   I was a little confused on how the automatic wash worked as I've only gone to the ones where it hooks onto your wheels and pulls you through. This one you drive up and the machine drives around your car and does it's thing.  Here's a tip for you - before you go in grab the brush in the bucket and pre-wet/pre-scrub any difficult areas such as your grill or wheels. That way when the machine goes you have a better chance to get everything off as automatic cleaners generally do a terrible job on those items.  So why the $5 star? I felt like the prices here were a bit higher than other places. I used to have the unlimited plan at Clean Freak where I could go as many times as I wanted in a month, plus I got free and unlimited vacuuming for something like $15 a month - here, the wash is going to cost you $5 to $9.  I am no expert on pricing as I either buy the month plan and use it super frequent or I just wash it at home.

What is there to say about the Home Depot? Not sure.  The competition is generally Lowes. I find lowes to have a younger staff, maybe a bit better looking. However, who cares. The Home Depot has people who genuinely know what they are talking about.   For example, I was looking at table sanders one time and one associate came by and asked if everything is OK. I told him, just window shopping and dreaming. Then we started talking about large planers and projects we were working on. It's nice. It's nice to know that you aren't dealing with just plain salespeople but rather people who work with stuff they sell.

I like DSW. I like to find the bargains in the back.  The only thing that is bad is that when you check out they want a lot of information. They could probably get by with just a zip code.

I've been coming here periodically for about 5 years. Up until this point all I've done is mail letters or whatnot - but now recently I've mailed some packages.  One was a A/V Receiver. Heavy, bulky, and electronic. I can pack a box, but getting it there in a crumpled mess is a different story. So I just took it in and told em where to send it.  The bill wasn't pretty, but I didn't expect it to be a coupon clipper deal either.  With that said, the staff was pretty good to me. They sure took their time and made it right, especially with that receiver.

So, I admit, I found this place on Yelp. Yelp is my go-to source for everything, including health care.   As the other reviewer stated, some of the staff is Asian and they do have an accent. However, I've never had a problem conversing with them over the phone or at the desk. After all, most of your conversation should be with one of the doctors or the nurses - who as far as I can tell, speak perfect English (English as first language).  The care I've received has been good. I think the time it took to make an appointment and get in has been phenomenal. Each time I've gone, I've been able to get an appointment within 5 days, half of that by my own doing due to my own personal scheduling. But maybe this is the norm for most places... but I'm just used to past doctors that sometimes have a month waiting list. No bueno.  The main doctor, Richard Le, is good and fun to talk to... at least as a guy to guy. He's a guy I could see getting off work and having a drink with kind of cool. He doesn't have that stuck-up attitude that some doctors have and normally explains everything so that you can understand it.

My brother had never been here and I said he had to try it before someone jumped it on him. I think Panda used to be pretty good. recently, as in the last year, their food seems to be terrible - soggy and flavors are garbage.  If you are just dying for Chinese food, then go for it. If you want somehing more real, then go elsewhere.

I am not entirely sure what to say about this place except that it is my go-to store for pet supplies.  I have been in here multiple times to look for anything from cat litter, to cat food, to beds. (plus a long time ago, fish supplies).  Every time I have came I have been greeted by someone on the floor. In every case, the person seemed to know what they were talking about and made sure that I not only found the product... but made sure that I knew that if it didn't work to bring it back.   Let me say this once - customer service means a lot to me and this store has been very good to me.  So if you love your little furball at home, I suggest you come and get them some goodies here at Petco.

This is a normal Fry's Marketplace that is currently undergoing a remodel. Spacious aisles and friendly workers - many times I've been asked how I was doing or if I needed any assistance. Generally good prices permitting that you have a Fry's card - and with that said you can use your phone number that is one file if you don't want to carry the card around (I'm somewhat of a minimalist).

I think deep down I am a male shoe whore. I don't have a lot like some people, but I genuinely love shoe shopping. I love looking for those deals. DSW has all sorts of shoes for men - oxfords, loafers, boots, athletic, sandals, and safety shoes. For women, there are even more (in fact, the store is about a 30/70 split between men and women items).  I've compared the prices with Amazon and Zappose (which used to always have the lowest prices) and it seems to me that DSW always had the lowest price after taxes/shipping/etc.  If you are like me - male or female - I suggest signing up for their reward program. Look for their 2x point coupons as well. Don't be afraid to peruse the clearance racks.

Come here for the pizza... or the cheesy garlic knots... hmmm...  In all honesty... come for the cheesy garlic knots!!! I've never been disappointed and neither has any of my guests.  But really, the pizza is good too! I just happen to be so sidetracked by the cheesy garlic knots half the time that I have no room for the pizza! :(

In quiet chandler there isn't many options. This is a pretty good place. Crowd is young in the evening, especially after all the local servers get off work and come here to spend their tips. Get the tacos trio. Get the margarita special and keep em coming.

I'm more of a party bar type person. Sitting around listening to live music that I've never heard and have no idea how to dance to isn't generally my thing. I've been to FGs when they had parties going on (including St. Patrick's Day) as well as just to get lunch.  It really isn't my thing in either case. If you just want to have more of an Irish time sitting around talking to friends and drinking G, then this is your place.  Still a nice place and food is generally alawys good to me.  St. Patricks is a clusterfuck. Craziness. Fun. Just remember that if you go for this event, don't drive. Don't even drive if you've only had one beer 5 hours ago. Police will sit around FGs and pull you over, pull everyone over, that comes out of that place. I got hauled in for a DUI after the cop said that I made an improper left turn (how convenient of him to make that up so he could pull me over). Luckily I had stopped drinking hours and hours before leaving so I was way under the limit and the case got thrown out.

I live in Chandler. So Souvia is a 40 minute drive without traffic. I've been twice.  You know what this means? It means it is good. It means that I like it. But don't take my word for it, look at all the other 5-star reviews others have also given it.  Oddly enough, both times I've been here I have been slightly sick (or getting over being sick). Since I am no tea connoisseur I've always just walked in and said something along the lines of, "Hey yo, I'm coming off a cold, yo yo yo, so what do you suggest?" Alright so I don't talk like that, but they always have multiple options for me to chose from.   So, take your pick.  Each time I've gone in with my cold I've walked out feeling at the very least, refreshed. So either a placebo effect took over... or their good tea suggestion helped.  They have a lot of suggestions... and you could probably mix to make your own blend without them even batting an eyelash. You can also buy to take home... and I am pretty sure they are less expensive than Teavana.  $8 and change for two full sized cups for a friend and myself. Sure beats $8 a cup at Starbucks!

So I've gota bad habit of ordering the same thing over and over. I broke that mold the other day and decided to get a green chilie burrito.  NOT. DISAPPOINTED. DELICIOUS.  Quite honestly, I don't know why there are so many negative reviews of this place. They are always friendly, always quick, and the food has always been good. Are people mad that they have to pick up their food at the window or something?  I still love the salsa too.  Looking forward to my next visit!

$2 for a movie per person, on Tuesday ($3 other days). Awesome! The theaters are the old style - non-stadium seating - but that didnt bother me. Lots of seating and the seats seemed to be the same comfort level as the expensive theaters. The concession stand seemed to be cheaper as well. $4 for a souvenir cup ($1.50 refills for as long as you have the cup) and $5 for a large popcorn that gets you one free refill while still there.  Movie and sound was great.  I actually really liked the clay figurines of characters. I am fairly fond of Star Wars so seeing a lot of those guys was pretty cool. The kid likes pirates so he was all about Jack Sparrow and Davey Jones.  Cant get much better for a dollar theater IMHO.

Going to the MVD used to be something that was almost viewed as a threat to one's life. It meant that you'd live at the MVD for an entire day without food, water, facilities, and would be swamped with boredom and suicidal thoughts.  Today the MVD is much easier to palette. To start off, if you go online you can see the amount of people in line as well as the estimated wait time. You can do this for the MVD office as well as emissions testing (they even have cameras at the emissions testing place). In my experience, the times are fairly accurate.  When I arrived I noted the time the website said. Website says 11mins, 16 people in line at 8:57am. I was called to my first window (to retake my licence photo) at 9:05am. I was called to my final window at 9:12am. I was out of the parking lot before 9:30am.   Website estimated time: 11mins Time to final window: 15mins. Pretty damn good!  As for the people complaining about the "randomness" of the number calling. If you actually observed you'd understand that all the numbers are called in order, i.e. A-001, A-002, A-003, etc. while at the same time other prefixes may be on different numbers... T-041... So you might hear D-123, A-009, T-014, etc but that doesn't mean that they are going out of order... it simply means that different jobs categories are being processed. I had an "A" which I assume is for general tasks such as renewing licences. Other letters probably mean vehicle inspections, legal, licence testing, etc.  Also, something else that is nice is that you can do the paperwork at home and print off a "barcode" and take it there and just give it to the clerk so they don't have to type anything in. They just scan and then do the other tasks that are actually needed aside from typing.  So here is my suggestions: (1) Leave your attitude at home. You're dealing with the red-tape queen - the government. Everyone is in this together, including the workers. (2) Don't expect to be in and out on your lunch break. This isn't Jimmy Johns serving you a sub. (3) Come with your cell phone charged up to read the news or watch YouTube or a good-old fashioned book. (4) Do as much paperwork at home and bring in the printout. (5) Check the website to see the wait time. Sometimes if you drive a little further than your normal office you can save a lot of time.

I was actually one of the guinea pigs that opened this place - I was a patron that sat in and let the staff do a trial run on me.  So I've been here a few times.  To be honest, I don't really care for the whole teppanyaki experience. It is a novel idea but it gets old after seeing it for every family birthday. Thanks sir, but no offense to you but I've seen the flaming volcano before.  The food is all over the board as far as quality goes. Sometimes you get a good mix and other times it is just OK. I've never had bad food at any teppanyaki restaurant, but don't expect the food to knock your socks off. This place is about the experience over the food.  The chefs are normally pretty good. If they hate their job, they they always put on a good face and put on a solid show for everyone. Good on them... or maybe I'm simply the only one that hates my job?  Is probably give this place a 3.5, but I can't do that here so I'll round up. OK food on the grill. OK sushi. Expensive (I got one roll and an adult beverage and it cost me 25) as all hell. Overall fun experience.

I went here on a Friday after having a crappy day. I actually wanted to go to Cadillac Ranch, but they were charging cover. No thanks. San Felipe's it was.   I had fun. But, maybe I just washed my sorrow's away by the music and alcohol.   Plenty of people dancing... and plenty of people out sitting at the picnic tables. The biggest gripe I had was that for the entire place, there seemed to be two bartenders. While they did awesome, it would have been nicer to have one more for a place that was packed. Ya know?  I have had the food here before, but I can't really remember it. So all I can say is that I didn't die from it.

Alright, I am giving this place a 5-star based off one sub - The New York Steamer. Holy crap this was good.  I actually didn't even get to eat this sub fresh as some stuff came up before I could stuff my face. Still, one of the best subs I've ever had in my life despite the slightly soggy bread due to me having to nuke it.  So, I actually ordered this delicious little morsel online. They said that they would email me when it was ready, but that it would at least take 30 mins. I never received an email, but instead a phone call. I rushed over there and snagged it.  The one problem I had with this was that I had some difficulty finding the place. The main display/sign and door faces away from the road. I actually passed by it a few times and ended up further down the road. Just know that it is only a few hundred yards from the road.

Oh patties. I could have swore that I've written numerous reviews for you! Have I been so drunk that even days later I am confused as to what I'm doing? That I thought I wrote something for you but really I hadn't?   It totally is possible... and for that I hope that you forgive me.  With that said, I'm now over 30 and Patties and her insanity seem less friendly to me these days. For granted, I like a good drunk and it seems that every time I happen to grace Scottsdale for a night out I end up here - normally dead last and with a cab scraping me off the sidewalk in the front... or maybe the back alley.  Pattie, being 30 is an odd age I tell you. You are too damned old to hang out with the wipper-snapper 20 yr olds who can drink 5 days in a row and then go to work fully functioning but not old enough to be yelling at the neighborhood kids to get off your lawn. You start getting disgusted with the music on the radio these days and yearn for the good old music. You'll occasionally try to have that big drinking night at the club only to realize you are starting to feel more like a chaperon than a party goer. But you really aren't ready to stay home and have wine tasting parties where everyone's bedtime is 8:00pm, so your party ends at 7:30pm.  Where do I fit in!?  And I suppose you feel the same, Pattie. You are in beautiful Scottsdale where money is abundant. You are in the city where the reputation is that all the girls are bitches and all the guys are douchebags and that everything has a triple-dollar-sign price tag on it. But you... you aren't any of that. You may live surrounded by luxury but you don't act it. You serve drinks in plastic cups for pete's sake. You let people smoke... "inside" just because the roof is a tin roof and it can be considered "outside." How can anyone not love that? When we step into your house, Pattie, we are in your world. Forget the lavish nature just outside your doors - walk in, grab a stool, and let that stool keep you standing up straight. If you are at this point, it was a good night and Pattie will love you even when you come looking like that. Heck, get on the dance floor and feel the music. The music loves you too. Hey, maybe you play pool better when you are drunk - well Pattie will let you play a round of that too.   Pattie, I know you know this - but you know that everyone loves you, right? Even though your signature scent is old cigarettes, spilled beer, and pissed on bathroom floors. You are THE dive bar in Scottsdale. Despite your shortcomings, you have one of the best atmospheres - you have the most forgiving crowds, you have the music playing that just makes you want to figure out what twerking is all about, and you have some of the best bartenders in town.  With all that said, nobody comes here to be seen. There are no photographers that will put your picture up on some website. The only pictures you will have from here are from your friends when you make bad decisions - the best decisions.  Can't wait to see you again Pattie, regardless of whether I am 20, 30, or 50. Nobody will notice how old I am anyways!

Cadillac Ranch seems like the Scottsdale away from Scottsdale. I've been here a few times and the crowd has always seemed stuck up.  I can't comment on the food as I've never tried it... so all I'm commenting on is the bar hoppers and the bar tenders.  The bar staff was nice one time... but I think it was just because I went there when it was slow and they (she) would come talk to me. However, the other time I went I may as well jumped behind the bar and made my drink myself... I'm not even sure they would have noticed. Maybe this isn't a slam to the bartenders themselves as maybe they were understaffed... as it was to the owners.   I dunno... I just haven't had the best time here.

Ah, Harem Hooka. How I adore your decor and general vibe. Nice lounge music, good looking people, and awesome looking hookas.   But, what the hell is up with your service? Even though there were numerous people working... the place felt like one person was tending to 50 tables... instead of 5 people tending to 15 tables.  I just don't get it, especially since for the most part once people have their hookas... you don't have to tend much to them. Now, I know Harem has food and drinks and that is keeping people busy... but still!  Also, your heat lanterns kept blowing out. Brrr. That made it a little nippy outside.  The owner guy (or that is what I am assuming he was) seemed a little bit pissed about life. Maybe he was stressed or something but he just seemed to generally be grumpy. It isn't good for the *owner* to kind of be in a pissy mood... especially seemingly toward patrons. (i.e. he was a little pissy with me when our pita and hummus order was taking 15+ minutes to come out and I told him just to cancel it).  I've gone to other hooka places and I think the "hooka experience" is much better. Maybe this is because they concentrate more on the hooka aspect of the business versus the restaurant/bar aspect. So I will say it this way... If you are looking for a trendy place for hooka... this is an awesome place. If you are wanting more of an authentic hooka with faster service... certainly try somewhere else.

For those of you who grew up in the Midwest, I think you will enjoy this place. I grew up with old diners and places where the servers were scurrying around behind the counter and making fun of the customers, talking sports, and locals coming in and the cooks automatically seeing them and just start cooking their favorite meal.  If you're looking for some sort of out-of-body breakfast experience, you won't find it here. This is old-fashioned breakfast cooking. No frills. With that said, they also aren't back there pouring eggs out of a carton either - no - they are back there cracking eggs just like you'd do at home.  They are fast at getting you your food out too.  In general the servers aren't going to chat you up a lot, but don't be surprised if when you walk in people at the bar do talk to you, especially if you are sitting at the bar.  I'm guessing the owners are from the Chicago area and transplanted here. Lots of Chicago memorabilia on the walls that is peppered with Arizona gear here and there. So if you have a problem with the Cubs, Bears, Blackhawks, or any other Chicago sports team... this is clearly not the place for you.  NOTE: Each time you check in you get a 10% coupon.

This will be a short review... when BWW came out, I really liked their wings. But over the years it seems like they've moved into cooking their wings and then just splashing sauce on them as you order them. This is OK, so long as you know this is what you are getting.  If you go with children be sure to see if they have any of their gaming systems available. They are good to keep the kids entertained while you eat or watch a game.  On a side note - I am allergic to the Caribbean Jerk. LOL.

First and foremost I am not a pho master. In fact, the first time I ever tried pho, I found one of my food allergies for the first time (tripe)!   With that said, I steered clear of the tripe this time and enjoyed it. I got the chicken pho like a good white boy.  Am I the only one that sometimes gives bonus points for the patrons that are there? Hopefully that isn't racist but it simply validates a restaurant more to me. For example, no real Mexican is going to have a family dinner at Taco Bell, a real Italian at Olive Garden, etc. Likewise with this place, lots of Asians having family dinners so I can only assume that they know good pho.  The food was good. I was feeling down with a cold and this helped me out along with my warm tea.

My girlfriend and her family rave about this place. It is good, but I personally don't think it is mind-blowing (not sure what mind-blowing pizza would be for me). With that said, the place does have good reviews and it is in a hole in the wall. Seriously, if they didn't know about this place I would have never found it. In fact, even if i GPSed the location I wouldn't have found it. It's just not a prominent place at all. In any case, it was good pizza and I would go again!

Tim and TMK is the best car repair shop I've ever heard about or gone to. I actually called Tim before I even had a car to take to him. I simply called up and asked him what he thought about a car I was thinking of buying. Most shops would have told me to just bring it in and have them check it out for $50 or whatever but Tim just talked to me and told me what he thought... and all this without me even being a customer. This sold me on TMK almost alone.  Everyone always fears mechanics because they can be dishonest and totally rip you off. But, I've never felt like that. In fact, I feel more like Tim is my neighbor and he just happened to walk over and help me fix my car.  If TMK doesn't know how to do it or knows someone that can do it cheaper... they will tell you. I don't know if they have the same policy but I think if you bring your vehicle in and ask them to "take a look" then they will just do that - they will check it out and tell you what is wrong and not charge you (versus "diagnosing the problem" or "fixing the problem... which will cost you). I've never heard of such a thing but this just makes me love TMK even more.  Are they the cheapest? Not on most things. However, I am confident that they will do it right and they will tell me the truth about what my options are. I've never questioned their word and would never think of taking my car anywhere else unless Tim directly refers me to them.

Alright, so im going to try to review this as someone who practically hates casinos. I don't gamble and I don't really like the atmosphere. I find casinos to be morbidly depressing - I feel like most people are there alone, looking like a zombie, and pumping money they don't have into a machine in dires hopes to win big. Not often have I went into a casino and said "man, they are having an absolute blast, I want to join them!"  With that said, I went here primarily for BAD Bingo. My only experiences with bingo were growing up and playing when we went camping. We just played with boards and dried corn pieces. The prizes were ice cream cones, cookies, and bundles of wood. So this was the first "adult bingo" I had done.  The bingo hall is a cross between a club, a wedding reception, a bingo hall, and a karaoke club. Seriously, get there early. They have the lights off, dancing lights on and people are having dance offs on the dance floor. Then they have karaoke sing offs. Then they go around literally spanking the birthday guests with paddles (hard if they want it).  This is the same bingo where you use an ink blotter to mark your letters. You will have to either bring your own or buy from the cage (for I think $4). They roll through a series of games where you have to get different shapes. Another reason to show up early is to review the boards and rules before you are in the mix. If you wanted to you could also get an electronic board that does the marking for you - so all you have to do is watch and call bingo if you get it. This was new bingo to me, but I liked it.  When bingo starts it is done and over with in a flash. It pays to know what you are doing because they call fast and they have the dancing lights going. Sometimes those lights literally mess with you so that you can't see what you've marked or read the numbers. Ha! Because of this once calling starts it isnt a time to converse, bitch, or share the latest gossip - you are feverishly trying to mark your cards and not go into an eplitic seizure.  Nobody in my party won but it was pretty fun... and I did it sober.  Results may vary if you chose to do it drunk.  As for the casino it was hopping on a Saturday night. Not sure if this was normal or what but there was a lot of people there! Maybe they all filtered into bingo? In any case the casino seemeed clean and had plenty of workers there that you could flag down if needed. The GF played some slots and walked away a winner on each machine she played on. Im just the opposite - I always joke that it is better if I just walk in and go to the teller window and hand them a $20 and walk away. At least then I can save myself the strife and pain of losing. Lol.

After cracking my LCD (not the glass) on my HTC G2 one drunken night I came here to see what they could do for me.  Luckily for me they had the LCD in stock and their turn-around time was 2 hours. Perfect. The price was $65. Even better, considering a new phone is $200+  The only thing I can say is that the new LCD that is installed is much less bright in direct sunlight than the original one. However, in normal light it is fine. Not sure if this is reflective of them - and I'm guessing not so I'm not docking any points for this.

So I came here in search for Phoenix's best Macaroni and Cheese. Yep, that's right, me and the inner kid in me are in search of the best Macaroni and Cheese.   So, ordering was simple!  So, how was it? Pretty good! It was more cheddary than, say, Beckett's Table (which got me started on this dance).  The atmosphere was pretty cool there. However our wonderfully bubbly waitress probably came over way too much. Also, nobody coming over to refill our drinks (iced tea) could figure out that we had tea and not water. Oh well.  On a separate note, I've gone by this place around 2AM it looks like a madhouse. Could be a rather interesting time around 2AM!

This place is always crowded on the weekends it seems. I've never been here when it is not busy. It is fun and it has options.  Want to chill? Well, hang out on the patio. Want to dance? Well, there is a dance floor. Want to drink? Well, this is a bar... Want to have barely clothed "batenders" feed you? Well, they do have that too but the "liquor in the bottle tastes more like kool-aid than liquor. But hey, it's free.

First and foremost, I believe this location is closing if it hasn't already. A local place to watch a game, work on your tour, or grab a late night snack this place will be missed.  In comparison to other OC locations you proved us with a bigger bar area for us to socialize in and in my case, yell at Wolverines or Steeler fans when those games were on. (Hey, I'm from Ohio. By default I have to be a rival of Michigan and Pittsburgh!). you had great happy and reverse happy hour deals that kept me coming back.  From what I hear, you wern't doing bad but the rent simply was too high to maintain with a decreased main seating area occupancy. Shame on you non-bar goers for not coming in - now where will us late night bar drinkers go in Chandler?

Location: As other posters have said, this place is inside an antique store. It is on the East side of Arizona and just South of the BMW motorcycle dealership and you will see a "Gourmet Hot Dogs" sign outside.  Hours: Make sure you check the hours before you head there. My friend and I got lucky as Wednesday is his extended hours day. The hours (at the time of this review) are. Mon/Tues/Thurs/Fri: 11:00-15:00 Wed: 11:00-19:30 Sat: 11:00-16:00 Sun: 12:00-16:00  The food: Good dogs? No. Awesome dogs? Yes. Since a friend and I had never been there Willy told us all about all his dogs and we obviously couldn't decide. So what did Willy do? He gave us the chili dog and gave us each half of another dog for free so we could sample that. Who the the heck gives you and your friend a whole hot dog for free these days? NOBODY! But he did! I was impressed. I also got a cold Pepsi in a glass bottle and my total only came out to $6 and some change. I'd call that a pretty **** good deal.  I also got the Willy Sundae and holy cow, you better be hungry!  Payment: Willy only takes cash at his register so bring cash. However, if you insist on paying by credit card then Willy will give you a ticket to take up to the front counter and you can pay there. You will be charged an extra service fee for the trouble though.  Willy: Yes, many places come by and ask how your food was and then walk away. But what I am talking about is actually coming out and TALKING to you. NOBODY! But Willy did. I thought that this was awesome. He could have easily just stayed in his kitchen or gone home but he came out and sat with us like a friend. Willy is truly one that cares about his customers and if for nothing else, his customer service should make you want to come back!  Other: I made this account specifically so that I could rate Willy's hot dog joint. It is that good. If you don't believe me, then look at the other reviews. And if you don't believe them, then go look at the award he won. This is impressive because Willy has only been around for 17 months. This is definitely a place I will bring any guests from out of town to!  Website: http://www.pittsburghwillys.com/pittsburgwillysmenu.pdf

This place was pretty good! Forget all the chains - Dennys, IHOPm and Village Inn don't have anything on this place. It just tasted... more homemade to me. Serving sizes might have been a little smaller than the aforementioned places but didn't leave me starving.  My guest also enjoyed their meal. The service was good too, with multiple people checking on you (it's a small place).  It also looks like if you wanted to sit outside that it is dog friendly. Will stop by again.

Ha, I liked this place! This is a place you will drive by every day and never know it is here. I'm glad I stopped.  I got the chili hamburger. Yum! I will say the pricing seems a little weird. If I remember correctly, it was the same price to get it with or without chili. So why not pay and get the chili!?

Cat got neutered. Was some confusion on the appointment - they wanted me to have a carrier and I didn't have one. So I dropped the cat off and went and got one, but never really checked the cat in. LOL. Checked cat in when I came back with carrier. Good price and healed great.

I stopped off here on my way off to the more prestigious places of Mill Ave after someone announced that there was $1 beer inside.   Why not pre-game before getting raped at another bar? So my brother and I graciously chugged a beer and headed off.  While in there I thought it was pretty cool. I am pretty sure that right before I was leaving the bar tender announced that he was getting cups out for some beer pong. How cool is that!? With that said, the place struck me as a down-to-earth place to come and have a drink or two or three and socialize. No expectations, maybe you could say.  I'm going to try to come back here - maybe for lunch sometime. :)

I haven't been here, ever, on a non-work day - so no drinking for me. From what I can tell though... if you want some sort of different beer... this is the place to go. I believe that they have won a few beer awards for the valley. So if craft beer is your thing... then so is the Monk.  how about trivia? They also have a trivia night.  Like wings? Well, come here on Monday for their bottomless boneless wing night for $9/person.  Pretty awesome place IMHO, and I'm not even judging it on the beer selection.

So I normally go to Kokomo since it is right next door to me. However I visited this location since I was up there.   At first glance, I thought how different can it be. And in honesty, there isn't much difference between Yogurtland and Kokomo. Except, I think Yougurtland has a bigger selection of yogurt and maybe a bit more toppings. So why 4/5? I think some of their twist combos are a bit whacky.  But here is the kicker... Yougurtland has these uber cool spoons. I love them. I'd come back just to collect the spoons.

I have spent $500+ at BevMo. I actually have a 10% coupon off my next entire order since I've ordered so much. But guess what... I go to TW&M now.   The way I figure it... TW&M has cheaper prices than BevMo and over time I will save money. Their selection is phenomenal. I think they have a bigger wine/champagne selection too, but I am not much of a winer drinker so I may not be the one to review this part of it.  I also am not a beer drinker... but I think they have a pretty kick ass beer selection. They even have a single-beer a la carte section from micro breweries. Pretty sweet huh?  Get here quick. The staff is knowledgeable too!

The first time I stumbled in here it was near closing time with a co-worker. There was actually *nobody* there. Nobody eating... nobody at the register.   Luckily, my friend and I were like little kids giggling at the choices and a worker came out. Just so you know, I don't care if they are out there staring at you the whole time or if they just come out at the end - just don't make me wait at the register... which they did not.  I will warn you though... this is more filling than it seems. Or maybe the Heavens are just telling me that I need to eat less. Not sure.  In any case, the bad? The fruit bar is deep and hard to reach the back items. you pretty much have to lay your face on the glass and reach in there like you are trying to find your car keys that dropped behind the couch. Or... maybe I am doing it wrong and the workers are supposed to scoop into your cup for you? Again, not sure. I'll make due with the face-to-glass for now.  Get there. I've gone again during the day and the place was hopping!

So this is what we ordered up for the night out - I got the Organic Salmon while my company got a Cobb Salad. We also got the fried pickles for an appetizer and a bottle of the Astica - Cuyo Mendoza Argentina Malbec. For dessert we had a skillet brownie with ice-cream.  The fried pickles were a bit greasy/wet, although that didn't really bother me. They were still good, just saying that you'll need a napkin to wipe your hands (unless you are more civilized than me and use a fork for these). I'm not much of a wine drinker but if I do - I don't prefer red. I find it too dry, but my company liked red, so I went for it. The Astica was pretty good and not too dry (my biggest problem with reds). We finished the bottle off without issue. The salmon was good. The bourbon glaze was super duper and amazingly I actually really enjoyed the quinoa that came with it. She enjoyed her cobb salad but can't comment on it too much since that wasn't my treat.  The brownie and ice-cream for dessert was delicious, as those type things always are.  My only complaint on the food was that I wish I had more salmon on my plate.  As for service and atmosphere it was pretty decent. We went on a Friday night and there was live music on the patio and they were rowdy outside. Not a big deal, but if you're trying to have a quiet intimate conversation, this could be a thing for you. Everyone dining there seemed laid back. The server seemed very busy - maybe more tables then they were supposed to have? Not sure, but everyone has their preference on how often they would like to be visited by their server. Oddly enough, most of the time I prefer them to come less, but this time I wanted just a bit more (maybe the biggest gap was around payment time where I felt like she dropped the tab and took a while to come back and collect the credit card).  Also on a side note, the entrance is in the middle of the restaurant. There is a door facing the roundabout but that is not the main door where the hostess is at.

Harkins is always a nice place to swing by for a movie. Theater always seems clean, sound is good, they let you know how full the seating is when buying tickets, and concession food is good as well.  The only thing I can complain about is that I wish I could remember my special Harkins cup when I go.

I believe this is a new location first of all. It is in the same general location as the old one though?  In any case the front desk girls were helpful and quick to get us signed up despite being a walk-in. I am not sure how much faster it would be with an appointment but im guessing that they fit you in as they can around the appointments.  All the appointments online were full.

I am not sure what other reviewers were dealing with but every time I've been here I've been helped and with speed. For granted, I never actually received my washer/dryer (bought on Black Friday for new house,  didn't get that bid and bid I did get was on house with washer/dryer). Both managers Shani and Angie helped with the return even though the normal return time had expired.

I like Sam's club. I used to work there and it was nice back then too. Things have changed since I worked there... for the better in my opinion. First off, they don't have to say your name anymore. I'm totally cool with this. I hated doing that when I was a cashier/supervisor. Half the names out there you just butcher anyways - mine included.  Prices are good on some things. I like to get TP, paper towels, and meat here. All that stuff adds up but it is generally a good price.   TIP 1: If you don't have a full list, don't get a basket. Only buy what you can carry. Those sample ladies will get you with their sweet treats! LOL.  TIP 2: Hungry? Get one of the meal deals. I think they are priced right.  TIP 3: Sam's has a 100% guarantee on their membership. Buy a membership. If you feel that you don't save money, somehow, then have them refund your membership fee. Seriously, buy tires from them... gas... TP, or whatever... for 363 days and then on day 364 go and have them refund it. They may pull up your orders and give you the stink eye... but they will stand by their membership. Please check with your store on this... but when I worked there I ated seeing people come in and get charged +10% extra just so they didn't have to buy a membership. I'd beg people that if they just paid it I'd walk them over to the membership counter and refund their money right away. Oddly enough people simply wanted to spend 10% more. Seriously, if you don't feel like you use your membership enough, get a refund before your anniversary date.  TIP 4: If for nothing else buy the membership to get discount gas. Looking at GasBuddy at this very moment Sam's gas is $3.21/gal. It is the lowest in my area. It generally is the lowest in the area. It seems that when the gas prices get low-low, Sam's might be slightly higher, but when they prices go up Sam's seems to be the cheapest by far (way more than 0.05$/gallon). I wouldn't doubt if they subsidize their store profits to keep their gas prices down.

I ordered two pizzas here for the kid's birthday party. We had a coupon but I wanted to ad the "points" to my Papa Points. The coupon couldn't be used over the phone for some reason so they told us to make our order as close as possible and then call back with the special instructions (double pineapple and double pepperoni). We did just that and all came out well. They could have easily told us to screw off but didn't. Even when picking the pizzas up they made sure that I knew that they followed the special called-in instructions. Great experience.

So the first time we visited Premier it was literally a place to sleep. It smelled and was hot when we got to our room. On the second round it was actually a decent place to stay. Still only used it to go to concert at Pavillion and not have to can it all the way home.

I can only rate this on the building as I didn't interact with the staff.  The parking lot is weird. There are two entrances (kind of 3) and if you take the one on the west side, it is possible that you'll pretty much be driving the wrong way and have to park backwards in the angled parking spaces. Must be driving west on Ray to enter the other two entrances.  Odd, but there you have it.

I've been here twice now unfortunately. The first time there was absolutely no wait. From the time of walking in to the time of departure was less than 30 minutes. The second time was about 2.5 hours from entrance to departure. Of course, any urgent care can't plan for the daily unknown influx of people so don't get in a bunch thinking you will waltz in.  On my second visit I figured I had just a common cold, which I did. They did all their testing quickly and didn't just wait for the doctor to order the test and make me wait more. That was nice. The doctor was nice as well, and maybe my experiences with doctors are skewed but what I wanted was a doctor's note so I wouln't have to go to work and contaminate or annoy my co-workers with my vicious cough. I had to ask a few times, and even then I had to ask immediately before my departure for a doctor's note again.  Overall, good experience both times - I'd just like to see them try to actively help you more even if it is a common cold. Other doctors seem be more agressive to ask what they can do to help you (medicine or notes). But then again, I am pretty sure half the people in the waiting room with me had teh same thing I did.

I went here and my review will be simple because my visit was simple.  I went in, signed in, signed out other forms, paid, waited 5 minutes in the lobby, was seen by the nurse to get my vitals, 5 minutes later I was in another room and waited 3 minutes for doctor, doctor saw me and in 5 minutes I was walking out of there with a diagnosis with a prescription.  My diagnosis was easy. Sinus infection. Even I knew this. But, the trip was enjoyable and easy.  I went on a Wednesday at around 3:30pm.

Scottsdale. Rock. Stripper poles. Alright...  This place kind of drops the whole Snobsdale vodka-cran crowd and introuduces the rockabilly crowd. Gimme a shot of straight Jager or Patron wouldn't be too odd here. Not a bad place for a change, and girls... you can probably leave your heels at home and not feel out of place. In fact, put on some boots... you'll fit right in.  Normally the waitresses take turns getting on the poles and dancing... and making money... if they are good. Most are OK, not that I'm an expert on pole dancing... I have seen one that was an expert and I think everyone knew it too as they were popping 20s into her panties and garter.  Drinks are pretty good

I am not a huge donut person. For granted, they are good, but I just can't get over the fact that they have so much sugar.  Lol, I sound like such a party pooper, I know.  I did the drive through and I must say that intercom sucked. I hope that wasn't the status quo because that speaker box looked... and sounded... like it had been ran over the prior night during a drunken Scottsdale party. You just have to order and hope for the best.  The drive through was a touch slow IMHO. Two concocted drinks came out before the donuts which I found odd since all they had to do was grab donuts off a shelf versus making the drinks.

I've been here for a few concerts and a few birthday parties. And before I say anything - casinos are not my place. I don't gamble and any time I walk through the gambling floor all I can think is that these people are all zombies pumping money they don't have into some machine in hopes of striking it big. I don't care for that vibe.  But I am here to review the venue, not the people, I suppose.  The place seems clean and fairly lively. The Ballroom is just that, a room. They set up a stage and throw some chairs on the ground for a concert. This is less than ideal because if anyone stands up in front of you then all you can see is their ass (and undoubtedly, everyone ends up standing). The Showroom is better in that it kind of has three levels for viewing... and it is much more intimate.  It has been standing only when I went. Take your pick. If I am going to stand anyways I'd rather pay less for a more intimate setting, but that is me.  Drinks are generally made pretty decent... but then again, I generally drink beer so that I can't get my drink watered down.  The buffet is a good meal. Come hungry, the buffet is huge.

I ordered a resume and a cover letter at separate times. I received a resume questionnaire and within 2 days I received a finished resume. It was much improved over my old resume.  I ordered cover letter and heard nothing back from them. I emailed PR to see what the deal was and didn't get a response either.  The resume and cover letter looks good but I must be honest, it is only going to be as good as your skills. In my case, my fresh looking resume and cover letter haven't got me a new job. :(

This place isn't bad and the prices aren't either. The thing I don't like is the hours. I work night shift and feel like it caters to people who can go at 9am or 6pm.  As another reviewer said, one nice thing is that at any given time at least half the vacuums are in the shade.

Location: Pretty easy to find. Just pull in and look for the sign.  Inside:  Plain, but I didn't expect much.  Service: I was greeted as soon as I came in. I said I had never been here and asked for suggestions. Pig. Bird. Etc. were the suggestions.  Food: I can't say I would rave about the food. The sandwich was OK, but I think it was on par with the buckets of pulled pork that you can buy at the supermarket. It was pretty large, I will give them that. I ordered the coleslaw and it was very dry. I worker later told me that if I liked it with a lot of sauce to just order it that way. Some people might like it as served, but I like it soupy.  Workers: Young people. Nothing against young people but they were just flighty it seemed. The boss, or what I can only assume to be the boss came in close to closing to lock up the chairs. Not to judge, but he didn't say a work to any of the guests and just had his large "DJ" headphones on. he seemed more interested in bossing the girls around than customer service. Now, I admit, I normally kind of find the managers asking how your meal was to be kind of annoying. However, I found it more disappointing to have a manager figure come in and just be 100% unconcerned about people eating at his place.

Jimmy John's claim to fame is being fast - and that they are. With that said, I most definitely prefer the slower Firehouse Subs. To me JJ subs are just plain subs that I can get at Subway, Blimpie, or Port. They are not bad subs and I really appreciate that they can hustle out dozens of orders in a few minutes, I just don't think that they are anything to write home about.

I've gone to smashboox on and off since it opened. It's a good place - I've been here when it is packed and when the staff outnumbered the patrons (awkward). The crowd is generally pretty good. I like electronic dance music so that is generally when I try to go (if I hear it playing when walking by).

Brought my cat in on a Friday evening after he swallowed a sewing needle and it got lodged in his mouth/throat. I got there at 5pm and left at 9pm. While I don't know what other animals were there or what they were there for it seemed like many were being brought in for concerns, not injuries (i.e. dog was shaking, etc.) so I would think that my animal would have been a priority. It did seem to take a while with that being said but I'm not complaining too much because, like I said, I don't know their procedures or what their workload was that night. Who knows, maybe I was seen in a very good amount of time!   The staff was very nice and kind to me and everyone I saw come in.  I got out for much less than I thought. I thought I was looking at $600 minimum but I got out for $200 (non-surgery), $97 of that is for ANYONE that walks in (what is it, $45 for a normal vet with an appointment. Doesn't seem bad to me at all!). I felt like they really tried to keep the cost down as much as possible. They did suggest some things/tests which I declined and they followed my wishes without any questions.  My personal thought is to hold off on taking your pet here. Not because the place was mean to customers, mean to pets, dirty, or unfair. I simply think that this is a place for emergencies only - not concerns. If you have a concern, schedule a meeting with your normal vet. That way the general vet fee will be lower, you can come in on a schedule and not have to wait, and your vet will have background information on them (hopefully). It also saves other pet owners time since you won't be occupying a slot. Just my opinion though.

Thursday is Tsunami Thursdays, an up and coming Thursday night event. This place is nice. I really like it! Excited to see what this place can become!

I took my brother here when he came out from Ohio to try this place. I technically give this place 4.5 stars but Yelp is a punk.  I arrived and promptly told the cashier that I had no idea how to order. They told me their suggestions and I ordered off that.   I don't even remember what I ordered, but what they brought was beautiful. My brother and I both had "special" sandwhiches (i.e. add this, hold that) and they still made them in an absolute jiffy, maybe 3 minutes during lunch hour!  I'd go back here without hesitation if I was in the area.

I miss their free house margaritas for checking in. I like this place.  Negative is that on the weekends the dance floor is ridiculously packed to the point that nobody is dancing at all... more like a mosh pit with douchebags carrying 3 drinks through the middle of the crowd.

Location: First off, my guest and I (we drove separately) had a little difficulty finding this place. I am not sure if this was because the sign was not lit up or what. But, they are just 2 weeks old and maybe that hasn't been done or something. Just we aware that the sign might not be lit up when you go.  Venue: It is actually kind of neat inside. There didn't seem to be any "prime tables" as all the tables were pretty much just 4-tops. Also, not a lot of seclusion if you are looking for that. About 40% of the venue is a bar, but isn't separated from the restaurant. Real sleek, suave bar. The kitchen is open. So, if the cook is spitting in your food then you will probably see them. I kind of liked having the open kitchen in a small venue.  Food: I had the Green Chili Stew with macaroni and cheese. Go ahead, laugh at my mac & cheese. The green chili was a touch spicy but then again, I am a total spice sissy. Even with that said, it *was* good. I ate it all.   The mac and cheese was a different story. I jokingly ordered that right off the bat and our server raved about it. Said he loved it. My guest also ordered it. Without a doubt, the mac and cheese was awesome. Really, I think it was better than my green chili stew.  Cost: It cost us $48 for two people. This was with 2 mains, 2 sides, an iced-tea, and an alcoholic beverage. Not bad.  Bottom Line: I see this place succeeding... especially if people can find it with their light off outside.

Amazingly, I didn't think this would have any reviews since it still had it's Grand Opening sign out front. Oddly enough, everyone that also reviewed this place only has 1 review to their name. Maybe they made their account because they loved this place so much!?  Interesting story on this review. I wanted to get something to eat and I was texting everyone I knew to see if they wanted to meet up somewhere. Nobody responded. However, I was hungry and didn't feel like cooking. So I started driving home to go and look on Yelp for somewhere new to try. Upon my exit I saw a homeless lady and thought... what the hell, why not try a new place with someone new? I wanted company and I'm sure she'd like a meal. So, I turned around and asked her to join me for dinner, which she accepted. So with that said, this review is for both of us - Thanks April.  I got the Chicken with Garlic Sauce. April got the General Tso's Chicken. Portions were large enough that neither of us finished our meals. Food was good, but nothing ***spectacular***. Bottom line, would I go back? Absolutely.  The service was a little quirky. We were pretty much the only ones in there at first and we were asked every 2-3 minutes if we were doing OK. Not a big deal, but I am sure some would find that annoying. On the bright side, my lemonade was never more than half empty (and I drink like a camel at a watering hole).  As another Yelper mentioned, the egg rolls were good. In fact, I may venture to say that they were some of the best I've ever had. They tasted very natural - aka, very green. It was a nice welcome to having ones have mushy lettuce.  April gives the place a 4/5. I give it a 4-4.5/5.

I don't know how many times I have driven by this place and never given it thought to stop and try it. Since I moved further out east my original sushi place is now somewhat distant to just stop by so I figured it was time to find another place.   I stopped by on the Chinese New Years. They had a pig prepared and we were able to try it before we left, for free. That was pretty awesome!   I also tried a few of their new/special occasion rolls, which one of them I was absolutely crazy about. As in, I told my server to ensure that he told his management and chefs that they needed to keep it on their menu. I really wish I remembered what they called it. It was different from any other roll ive ever had to teh point where I actually had the flavor seemingly change in my mouth (I've only had food so good that it changed flavor while eating it once before, and that was at the infamous Delmonico Steakhouse in Las Vegas). Effing delicious.  I think I might have to get here more often, even if I can't get anyone to come with me because it is "too far" for them. Crybabies.

So before going here all I heard about was how trashy this was and how everyone was bitchy. In short, I did not see this on the Saturday night that I went.  It was like any other country bar - mostly country plays and then they mix in some hip-hop/top40 for us that don't know how to country dance. Psht  - I really need to learn how to country dance!  Cheap beers. Until 11pm it was 0.50/drink. Yikes, that is cheap!

I went into BLD with my friend, who is also a chef, yesterday. We both ordered off the happy hour menu - he had the Chirizo Nachos and  I had the Pork Queso.  Now, my friend is a tough food critic. In all honesty he is way more picky than me - after all I grew up with siblings who would lick or spit on your food to try to claim it and you would either have to tough it out and eat it or starve. In short, my palette is much less sensitive than his and his cooking experience has him even higher standard than myself.  With that said, even upon my first bite I noticed that my chips were stale (or under-cooked or overcooked, not sure if there is a taste difference). Being the lenient one, I charged through the pile of chips for the Queso. Some of the chips were not bad. Aside from that, I thought the Pork Queso dip was pretty tasty. I am normally not one to enjoy tomatoes but I really enjoyed them in this dip. I really wish the "simple" part of my meal - the chips - would have been better. I think for the price I would have been better off driving downtown and checking out NachoBot, which is a bare-bone nacho shop... but hardcore delicious and I'm stuffed.  My friend had the Chorizo Nachos and really had to bear down to eat them. Not that he was gagging on it, but he wasn't super thrilled by it either. He didn't address it there (see comment below about asking for food) but did address them later in an email. On one hand, I wish my friend addressed it there so that I could have reviewed their response. On the other hand, sometimes it is better to not file a complaint in person - I hate having the management come over and give you free stuff - and maybe my friend didn't want free stuff either.  I cannot comment directly for him - all I can say is that he has told the restaurant before of issues with his food (again, see comment below about the server asking about food).  Our service was OK but my friend was really bothered by the employees during their idle time. I had my back to the employees but he said that they were all sitting/standing by the kitchen and essentially messing around. Now, I'm not one to be all hardcore about what people do at work when they have idle time, but they could at least do it out of sight of customers. My friend said that they kept looking over and laughing in our direction - coincidence or were they laughing at us, I cannot comment. All I can comment on is that it could have been more professional.  The restaurant itself was pretty cool looking - almost a little too upscale for Chandler, LOL.  With all of this said, this is the general basis for my review. My friend wrote an email to BLD to tell them that he did not enjoy his meal. BLD responded, in a way, unprofessionally. They seemed kind of personally offended. With that said, I do agree with them in part that the issue should have been addressed there instead of post in an email. However, call me shy or maybe just preoccupied but I don't ever remember the server asking "how is your food?" either. While this is nit-picky, most restaurants today ask this which I believe prompts you to comment directly on the food instead of just the service (i.e. "how are you doing."). I think if they had asked that then my friend, who was much more dissatisfied with his meal, then he would have addressed this there in-restaurant. Who knows, and maybe this is splitting hairs here. The personal service was pretty decent aside from this even though the "idle-service" being kind of weird with the employees sitting around texting and possibly laughing at you. Decor was awesome. Food was half-good (my pork dip, not the chips), but the prices outside of happy-hour seemed a little high to me. Last but not least while my friends email could have been addressed differently by him (in person, not email) they could have seemed a little less personally offended.  Bottom line is this - I doubt that I will visit again and it is not necessarily a place I'd recommend to others. The main reason that I would not suggest BLD is mainly due to the price - my food wasn't too bad aside from half the chips tasting stale. I can get far more food at other places for less money and I don't have to buy on the HH menu to keep costs down. Looking at other reviews on here it seems that other reviewers also felt the prices were high as well.

Pretty good food, especially when it is 3am and you are drunk The food is pretty good sober, too.  As everyone knows, their service time is dismal. Can't rush perfection though can you?

I swung by here with my brother after he suggested it. It was a nice surprise. Spacious area and tasty. Service was quick but we also went at a time when almost nobody was there. Price of pizza was slightly above average. Can't judge the alcoholic drinks as I didn't get them.

I've always felt like El Hefe Scottsdale was a stuck up bar that didn't need to be. This is one of the few places in all of Scottsdale that has ever questioned my attire - and I am usually the one in the group that get accused of dressing above the occasion. So how I got flagged, I don't know... especially since the bouncers were letting their friends inside with flip-flops and cut-off shorts while I was wearing nice jeans and a button up.  Once inside I've never been wowed by the prices either. I'd say they are again a bit too high for what they are (or maybe I don't know what they are), especially when you can go next door to Majerle's and pay half the price on nearly every drink you order.

For granted, a business can let in whoever it wants, but this place is SCOTTSDALE. If you have a vagina, front on line. If your ratio is over 1, front of line. Fuck single guys. Fuck couples. Fuck guys night out. They say it is because all these people are on the guest list. Lol, seriously? Like 50 people went in when I was next in line. No names were checked, nothing. Just go to express line and they were let in.  Worst degree.  I'm fine with VIP line for people who spent $$$ for a table, but this is stupid.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to blacklist this POS Vegas-wannabe club.

Rally's isn't a "fast food" in the sense that you food is flying out on a tray 10 seconds after your credit card is swiped. It took about 3 minutes for my meal to be prepared with generally nobody else here.  So if you are in a rush... go to Taco Bell or McDonalds.   With that said... I ordered the Roadhouse Bacon Burger. It was good. The bread was even flatbread, which made it more than just standard burger.  Fries are awesome too. No ketchup required!

I've never had a problem with this place - not when I've ordered online, not when I've ordered on the phone, not when I've called an order in, not when I've done carryout, and not when I've done delivery.  Good pizza. Get a coupon and you can get a good deal.

I have loved Halloween ever since I was little. Every year I want to make my own haunted house but suffice to say, this is no easy task. So I take the second best option and that is just to attend the "best" one around town.  I thought that the 14th floor was going to match that bid - after all I think I originally found it on a "nationally ranked haunted house" list.  I went with my girlfriend (who is scared at the haunted train ride at Schnepf Farms), her friend (who wore a pad for when she peed herself), my buddy, and his girlfriend. My summary wouldn't suffice because it seems that I am a hard-ass so let me give my girlfriend's review - "that was a waste of money."  Yes, my girlfriend who is scared of children's haunted houses where people just walk around in masks (or not) was more afraid at those than the 13th floor.  The house is the same as any other - walk around in the dark and have people rawr at you around corners. Not scary in my opinion because I *know* that is coming. Reading the other reviews I actually think that we were at a completely different place. Fake doors? Moving floors? I must have went in the sissy door because I didn't get any of that.  Best part? Going through took a little bit - it wasn't a 10 minute walk-through.  So what am I into? I'm probably more into the haunted houses where you have to sign a waiver, have a safe word, will come out drenched in blood, and there is a high likelihood that I will be kidnapped, stripped naked, or put into highly emotional and deep human conflict situations. (Check out Haunted Hoochie at Dead Acres, The Cult, Freakling Bros: Gates of Hell, McKamey Manor, or the Blackout Haunted House. Unfortunately there are no such haunted houses around Phoenix so I'm stuck with the "jump around the corner" type haunted houses.  I think it is more scary to walk around downtown Phoenix at night. Ha!  So if you are like me how can you make your experience better? First, separate yourself from the group. If nothing else, you can stay with your group but separate yourself from the main group. If a slow group is in front of you then the actors/props will jump out and scare them with you in the background. Giving some space allows the actors and mechanics to reset and you get a fresh viewing. Second, quit speculating what is around the corner and preparing yourself. Third, ditch the scaredy cat that will cling to you and thus give you that extra confidence that you are "not alone." This coincides with my first two points. Fourth, if you must go in a group, go in the front... or the back. You will have the most likelihood for people to come and attempt to scare you.  As for General versus VIP, that is a tossup. I did the GA and didn't mind it. Actors come around and harass you. I actually found that to be more enjoyable than the house itself. The VIP line was much shorter, though.

Alright, so I just started bowling more competitively (aka I don't go to the lanes, get drunk, and try to wing a 8lb plastic house ball down the lane at 30mph) and have gone to two shops for services - Bowler's Zone and Bowl with Leverage. The former is inside the AMF Mesa Lanes and the latter is inside the AMF McRay Lanes.  Now, my experience with the Zone was this. Walk in and say I want to start bowling with a hook. They measure my hand and suggest a ball. I pay and come back a week later to pick the ball up.  Now, seeing as I am a new bowler who doesn't know jack, it might be nice to make sure that the ball fits my hand. At the time, I had no idea how it was supposed to fit, after all my only experience was bowling with house balls which are definitely not fitted for your hand and are even drilled for full-finger, not fingertip.  Over the last 5 months or so since I bought here, I've learned how crucial thumb fit is. To most people a thumb that you nearly have to squeeze in is a much poorer a fit than a ball where your thumb doesn't touch the walls. However, the reality is that a bowling ball thumb hole should be much tighter than we think and it is something bowlers fiddle with all the time. So it would have been nice if the shop had me pop my thumb in and see how tight it was before I took off. FYI - my ball is 2-3 tape pieces too big and my thumb shrinks when I bowl.  Enter Leverage. I have never bought a ball there first of all, but I have had them move my ring finger hole back because my finger wasn't fitting. While I was there my friend and I consulted the guy behind the desk bout thumb fit. He told me that mine and my friends was too loose and told us how tight it should generally be. He even gave us a few pieces of tape for free just to get us to feel how it should be. We also talked about thumb angles and other things. Now this was a world of difference to me - the other place the guys running the shop seemed more interested in rambling about who-knows-what-but-we-will-take-your-money than really getting to know the bowler. And here I was getting free advice and even a (unexpected) piece to help me understand the game better. My ball now fits better and I've had two games over a 200 (not the best I know, but its good for me) with it.  Since then, I've obtained a new ball. The first ball was a Storm 2Fast and the new one is a Brunswick Wicked Siege. After my good experience with Leverage I decided to go here to get my new ball drilled. GREAT choice! He drilled it on the spot and took me back to the drill and custom fit the thumb hole. He had me take my thumb in and out and even drilled it a little oblong, because, well... my thumb (and I'd guess a lot of thumbs) isn't round but rather oblong. Thanks Dave!  Needless to say but I'm not going back to the Zone to get a ball or ball work done and my new shop is Leverage... without a doubt. I think Leverage's mindset is that if they can make a happy bowler, then they make a happy customer.  This is customer service. This is what you want. And now that I wrote this review... I really want to go on a date right now with my Wicked Siege. Hahaha.

A small oasis in the center of the city. Water, benches, picnic tables, sculptures, and nice grass. I know, grass seems funny to mention but I say so because I can see having a picnic here without sitting in dirty or feeling all scratchy.

I simply don't understand some of these reviews below. People are knocking the place because they steam their meat instead roasting/braising it? C'mon. So you can't handle something different or what?  So for this review, I'm comparing it to Subway and Quiznos.  First off, Subway and Quiznos build the sub right there in front of you. At Firehouse, this is not so much the case - you order at the register and then the workers prepare it. For this reason, your sub will take slightly longer to make than either of those places and this is mainly because of how they cook the meat.  Now to the complainers saying that the meat is soggy or whatever, I've never had this experience. And, besides that, not all subs are cooked the same at Firehouse. Maybe before discarding the place, try more of the menu? That is just me though! I've tried many of the subs - Firehouse Meatball, New York Steamer, Italian, Club on a Sub, and the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket. My favorites, in order, are Italian, Steamer, and Beef & Cheddar. On a slightly odd note, the Italian makes *great* leftovers if you can't finish it.  Nobody really seems to have mentioned this... but the soda machine is freaking awesome. I don't know how many flavors it has, but it is pretty much the craziest thing you will ever see. It has a touch screen where you scroll through and select your flavor. And when I say select your flavor I mean if you want a Lemonade.... do you want it to be lemonade, raspberry lemonade, lime lemonade, or strawberry lemonade. It is nearly the same for every beverage selection you make.  I definitely prefer Firehouse over Subway or Quiznos. Sure, they may be a little more pricey, but I still like it. I will have to check out Jimmy John's, which everyone seems to rave about to see what all the fuss is about and round out my review for all 4 places.

When I rolled up to this Freddy's the parking lot was empty and I couldn't see anyone inside. I figured - location, location, location and this poor little buddy went down because it didn't have a good location or something. I stammered in anyways and to my dismay they were indeed open - the workers all kind of looked like they were bored out of their mind. I was thinking, maybe they are indeed hurting for business.  I ordered the #1 and it was delicious. Their fries were little shoe-strings that were browned just right. Perfect. I generally like the opposite end of the fry spectrum - big meaty potato wedges, but these were really, really good. I was impressed.  The burger was equally good. I am a big fan of "old school" hamburgers that feel like they were made out of raw meat and thrown on a grill. These may have not been made out of raw meat, but they seemed like it. I will warn you though, even the double patty deal was about the same thickness as a single 1/4lb patty elsewhere. So yes, these patties are thin, almost crumbly. So if you're hungry you might want to order a second or just really concentrate on the fries (which they seemed to give a lot of). This is a little odd but I really liked that they gave a whole dill pickle slice for the pickle. I love pickles so they won my heart on that front.  I had never had custard before (gasp from the gallery, I know) so I wanted to try that before I left. how bad could it possibly be? I already love ice-cream, gelato, fro-yo, and shaved ice so how could I not like frozen custard? Well, it too was a win. I ended up eating it all even though I was pretty full. We got the Chocolate Brownie Delight.  On a total random note I really liked the "fry sauce" which I think was just ketchup and mayo mixed. I reminded me of the middle-school days when we would mix up the two and eat it on everything on our plate.  I'll give this place a 4.5/5. It was good but I really wished that the fries were a little more beefy. I felt like I had to go grabbing 300 times to eat my portion and I'd rather be lazy and rach 15 times and eat the same amount. LOL.

Took my CCW class here, bought a gun here, and also done transfers through CTR. Always a good experience.  As someone else said, they are currently not accepting plastic right now - os bring cash. Previously they did accept plastic with a +3% fee, but that was before the gun/ammo rush.  Prices on new guns seem to be pretty good here (at east even with other places). If you've done business with them and are interested in a CCW class, ask to see if they have a discount since you are a previous customer (they gave me one).  Firearm transfer with or without a CCW is $20 for a long gun.

UPDATE 11/20/2011: Xbox360 has held strong through multiple days of multiple hour COD:MW3 playing sessions. I'd call it fixed. I still cannot recommend the service because even though he costs ~$10 more than his competition, I was given attitude and the run-around trying to get it back in to get repaired. It is a serious pain trying to deal with a company that doesn't answer their phone, doesn't return texts, doesn't return calls, doesn't return e-mails, and isn't there during their normal business hours... until you threaten them with a BBB report.  UPDATE 10/28/2011: Xbox360 repaired again. Reflow. Same day.  UPDATE 10/27/2011: Email and call saying that I demand to know Andrew's exact hours.  UPDATE 10/20/2011: Stopped by to drop off Xbox360, nobody there.  UPDATE 10/19/2011: Stopped by to drop off Xbox360, nobody there even though it was before 5pm.  UPDATE 10/18/2011: Emailed Andrew asking for hours. Said would be there until 5pm.  UPDATE 10/12/2011: Emailed Andrew. No response.  UPDATE 10/10/2011: Xbox360 has received it's 3rd 1RROD.  UPDATE 10/05/2011: I received my Xbox360 back and it works. Andrew did not reflow it again because reflowing again may damage it. The console does work and he used his 30 day warranty to repair it at no additional cost to me. The Xbox does seem to operate a tad bit slow though, which I'm not sure if that is due to work.  UPDATE 9/27/2011: I sent Andrew a message threatening to report him to the BBB, report his cash doings to the IRS, and actively advertise against him on Craigslist (where he advertises). He almost nearly immediately wrote back saying he would help me. He said that he had been busy with preparing for his baby and had been sick but hadn't had a chance to check his messages. I personally think this is horsecrap as it seems that as soon as I went from nice to threatening... he perked up and wanted to help. Now, I know that everyone gets busy and that stuff comes up in life. But, a week of emailing AND calling... and nothing? C'mon!  When I went in to drop off my Xbox for the second time (9/30) I actually did the nice thing and apologized for getting nasty and threatening him. And you know what he said, "Yeah. I don't take too kindly to that." Maybe I am just a naive moron, but I thought as a business man, he'd realize the old adage of "the customer is always right" and apologize back. And in this case, I still think I am perfectly in the right because for all it seemed from my end, he was a "fly-by night" operation and he surely wasn't going to honor his warranty. So to get snippy with me after I tried FOUR times to get in contact with him in various ways seems like very poor business to me.  For this reason, I am knocking his star rating from a 4-star to a 1-star. A customer shouldn't have to jump through hoops then just be faced with attitude. It seems that old Andrew is OK with taking $40 the repair but when it comes to working for free under a warranty, he is not so chipper about that.  UPDATE 9/20/2011: The Xbox360 died. I emailed Andrew twice and left a message for him twice explaining to him that I wanted to see about utilizing his 30 day warranty. I received no response. So the fix worked for 5 days.

Ha, nacho's nachos... or nachos. What will you have? I'll have nachos!  Nachobot is in a weird place. When you arrive, it will look like a house. That is just how this street works as all the houses on this street are businesses. Deal with it.  Secondly, the dining experience is more akin to going to a friends house and you laying on the floor to eat than a restaurant sit down place. Again, this is a house with some benches along the wall and a porch. I opted to block the way, and sit on the porch steps. so if  you're looking for a place where you can stare doe-eyed at your date across a table... this is not the place. Deal with it.  Food: I got the chicken one, whatever that was officially called. It was damn good. The salsa sauce stuff combined with the chicken and cheese made quite a tasty treat. You know what I liked though? They serve it with chopsticks. Yes, effing chopsticks. Keep those hands clean for groping your girlfriend and use those chops to clean your plate.  Beverage: They serve all bottles in the classic glass bottles. Meaning, when you finish it... you have to buy another one.  What I thought was "bad" was that it was $7 for a plate... which didn't include a drink. But then again... There was enough food that I didn't even eat it all, so maybe I'm just being a little bitch here after eating on the cheap at home. But for sure, one thing that I didn't care for was the "one serve" drinks. I admit, I love to drink/eat at 50/50. So when I ran out of my beverage (water), I was kind of like, meh, I don't want to buy another one...  but then again, this place kind of strikes me as a place that wouldn't even care if you brought your own soda/water. Not sure on that.  I will be back... and I'll bring a date (if for nothing else, how badass is it to say that we are going to go eat nachos while sitting on a porch?)

Dollhouse is the old Crown Room. Many people who used to go to Crown Room are not happy about the "upgrade." With that said, I never went to Crown Room so I can't judge.  My initial Scottsdale club review is that this club is kind of weird. When I walk in I feel like it is... too bright. As in, the dance floor is too bright. Maybe this is why I've only seen a very small amount of dancing here - people feel conscious.  I can't judge on the tables or the table service. They look cool but I've never been a table type person.  Outside is cool and there is almost never a line unlike the nearby Mint, Smashboxx, and El Jefe. The prices of drinks seem about average for Scottsdale.... but maybe a little on the high side (not as high as Axis-Radius, which IMHO is very expensive club drinks). Volume is lower than a dance club (Smashboxx) but higher than a lounge (Suede), so if that matters to you (and your date) you can take notice. With that said, I do like it's location. It is pretty centrally located with it being about half way between American Junkie and Myst. This makes it an awesome spot to stop by on the way when you are club hopping.  Overall, the club is fairly decent for what it seems to fulfill - a club that has pretty good music but isn't jam packed like a dance club. It seems better suited to get a birthday party together and get bottle service and get crazy with your friends at a table versus going and dancing... This seems to be echoed in other reviews.

I love Studio Movie Grill. What can be better than watching a movie and eating and boozing!? Awesome. Look on Groupon to see if there are any coupons for this place - they many times hae nice little deals for this place!

I am far from a food-snob. I am much more likely to enjoy a PB&J at home then eat at some expensive and fancy 5-star restaurant. Go ahead, call me unrefined if you must.  I took the girlfriend here to try something new. The experience was cool but I didn't particularly get enthused by the food. It wasn't bad... it just wasn't to my liking. With that said, the GF liked it. We ordered the bruschetta which was totally different. You actually pick 4 flavors out of 6 flavors - mix and match how you like. The flavors were not what I was expecting. We got the  Pistachio, Date and Marscarpone; House Made Ricotta, Heirloom Tomatoes and Basil Vinaigrette; Tenderbelly Bacon Jam and Whipped Goat Cheese; and the Prosciutto, House Made Ricotta and Fig Honey. The prosciutto was by far the most "normal" of the bunch in my opinion. The tenderbelly bacon jam one was interesting - like a smoky, meat, jelly concoction that really didn't make sense to my tastebuds but was still good. The pistachio one felt like I was eating a gooey trailmix blend on a piece of bread. Again, not bad but just not my style. Maybe someone who likes the finer things in life would enjoy them more than I did. Your mileage may vary and I think I would have enjoyed the bowl of olives more.  I ordered the brazilian steak and the GF ordered the watermelon salad. For mine the brazilian steak was, again, different. It was more like a raw beef hamburger than a steak. Very flavorful but I could have used it less juicy/messy than it was. Still good. I'd get it again. The GF loved her salad.  In general I kind of want to give it a 3 star review. It just wans't anything that wowed me. However, I feel like I walked into someplace that I knew was different and I got what I thought I was going to get... something different. I can't knock a place for doing what they do any more than I can knock McDonalds for not being a 5-star restaurant. For what it aims to be I think it does a very good job at. I'm not hankering to go back but if the GF wants to go back then I'd like to try something different there...  ... maybe the Queen Creek Olives, Italian Flatbread, Salmon, or vintage Burger.

What can I say about Circle K? Well, first of all, no gas here. Secondly, it is the same as any other Circle K - ice, booze, gum, and soda. I normally go to QT but unfortunately my brother's car was towed while partying in Scottsdale so we had to walk to the nearest ATM, which was at Circle K. On a side note - the lot looks like it's had better days... for being in Scottsdale I figured it wouldn't look like it had 28 cars leaking oil on it.  2-stars because it doesn't have gas and QT is far superior.

So it's been a while since I've been to a sit-down pizza place so I decided to go here and give this place a shot. To my surprise, even though they had only been open for 2.5 weeks every table was full when I arrived with my date. The wait time was only 5 minutes - and a good excuse to cozy up next to my date on the bench by the door (evil plan, I know!)  After our wait we were awarded a booth. Unlike some places, this was a pretty good sized booth that I think you could probably fit 3 people on each side and not have an absolute elbow fight fest. They also had bigger booths and tables if you party was larger or smaller. The chairs were comfortable, even for my nearly Dirty-30yr old back.   I liked the atmosphere. The lights were down low and even the table light was not blinding, but also not so dim that you couldn't see who was across from you. I liked this. Even though all tables were occupied, the place wasn't all that loud. No yelling at your date like at the new club.  It is kind a fine line to walk but in honesty it is a pet peeve of mine as to how frequent the server comes. Too often and I feel like I can't even carry a conversation because I'm always having to stop and say "yes everything is OK." Too sparse and I end up getting aggravated and attempt to fall asleep at the table to get your attention. Our server was kind and wasn't overly in your face and even when she came by she would crack a joke or something - I'm not really sure how to describe it other than I felt like she was being constructive instead of fulfilling an obligation to meet some corporate quota on server table visits.  Food. Alright, first off I'm an idiot. I brought my date to a pizza place when she was allergic to gluten. Great right? I just brought her to a place where she can't eat! I only tell you this because after the dust settled she decided that she could have some of it. So here you have it... someone that knows that they are going to get sick from eating the food... and they ate it anyways. And they liked it and said it was "worth it" (or maybe she meant I was worth it? No, no, it was the pizza!). That's a pretty good testament of the food... RIGHT? I think so and I agree that the food was pretty good! We got the cheese sticks and a halved pizza (two different types) with two of the signatures.  Another thing with food that I always review is the reheatability. I know this is kind of weird, but it is disappointing to take some food home and when you reheat it tastes like garbage. Both the pizza and the sticks reheated well. So, bonus points there Boombozz.  So here's the final verdict. Cool place. Cool workers. Cool food. I'll be back. As for the date, unfortunately we didn't work out. Maybe if I hadn't taken her to a gluten party house things may have. :P

I love this place. The food was good as was the service.  With that said, the only downfall is that I could see this place being downright horrible for business meetings and being horribly congested during lunch - get it and go!

I was craving teriayaki chicken so bad. I seriously hadn't had it in years. I didn't even know of any around my place. Then, Yogi's appeared out of nowhere (OK, it's been there a while, I just didn't know it)!  YES!  I loved it! I will be back when the next craving hits me!

The first time I came here these guys were a mess. I'll chalk it up to being new but you could tell the other customers wern't having it.   My order (#2) came out fine. I scarfed it down in store and people watched all the other angry and impatient people in the lobby. It was quite fun.  I went back 3-4 days later and they were much improved!

The first time I went here I loved it. I got the moist brisket and some other stuff. It was like a picnic out there. Loved the sauce on the table too.  Second time I went I didn't like it as well. I think I got a more fatty cut and it was slightly cold.  Not a big deal. I grew up with 3 siblings so you ate what you got and didn't complain! I'll be back!

More than any other place I ate I felt like Senors was $$$$ for an average meal. I compare this to back home where Dos Gringos has the same food and same liquor for about 1/8th the price.  I guess it was cool that they had a live DJ. Maybe I should come back only on happy hour.

I've been to Monarch once - for the Kill the Noise DJ set on 22 October 2015. In general, I liked it.  For the true opener the music was loud, but mainly just the bass. While standing 15'  from front gate I could talk to my friend next to me at a normal tone. As the second opener they turned it up to a normal club volume.  I didn't think the volume was too loud, but in doing it again I would suggest wearing noise reducers (not ear plugs). These will allow you to still hear your music, and feel it, while cutting off the higher pressures that you don't need. This is simply the nature of the beast in having loud music inside where it essentially a small warehouse where there are no proper acoustics to help reduce the "noise friction."  With that said, it did have a small warehouse feel. So leave your pretty Scottsdale attire at home. IMHO, it was a good blend of club and rave. Dirty. Everyone dancing. Pretty peaceful (even the security was dancing and jamming out). Some in raver type gear, some in normal street gear. General PLUR atmosphere.  Drink prices were higher than Scotssdale prices. $10 for an AMF in a 10oz plastic cup $7 for a domestic long neck Yikes................  Parking across the street is free at night - at least that is where everyone seemed to park, without issue.

I don't know what it is with this place but my gf and her family love this place. For me once I've seen the show I've seen it a thousand times and it is old. Of course, the kids love the show and love the [irritating] birthday song of which they will sing every day until the next birthday that is held there.   I have tried the grill and the sushi and neither has truly impressed me. The grill is hit or miss and probably depends on the chef and how much seasoning they put on the food. The sushi was OK but a bit on the expensive side. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had come starving instead of arriving already content. Normally I will eat 3-4 rolls and this time I couldn't even eat two - the rolls are the larger diameter rolls BTW.  The servers do keep your glasses full and are poignant on checking on you without being annoying. This is a big kudos to me as this is a fine balance of feeling forgotten and feeling annoyed.  I judge for what it is worth and this is a place for parties, not gourmet food served under candlelight. Chances are you will hear that annoying birthday song and see someone running around with an paper-mache Asian-face helmet on - that is just how it goes. It is good for this but I do dearly hope on a regular basis that the GFs family picks something different for the next birthday because going there every month is too much for me.

You have to love tow-n-impound places. I'm not sure if my HOA started hating me but I've had to deal with this place twice now, about 14 days apart.  While they seem fairly nice, they aren't so nice to your wallet. Their hours are squarely at times when you are working, meanining that when you call them "after hours" they will charge you extra to bring someone "off-duty" to get your car out. What a racket.  When I was there the second time someone else had their car towed by Monster as well, only they said Monster just picked their car up in a legal parking spot and hauled it off and never told anyone. While I can't say whether the car was parked legally or not I can say that taking someone's car and telling nobody (mainly the police in this case) seems wrong. To me, that seems like vehicular ransom. The first time they towed at my place I called the police and the police had no record of it being towed. The police called back and said Monster had informed them they were in posession of the car. The second time I didn't call the police so I don't know if they ever informed the police (I already knew who took it so I called them first). I wouldn't doubt if they were into that type of thing honestly.  2-stars for being fairly nice. And 1-star if I could confirm that they were into car-ransom schemes.

I came in with a slew of issues that were non-vital - oil leaking (older car), clicking when the car turned, and and electrical problem. Oil pan gasket was replaced and no longer leaks. Clicking is still there (couldn't find the source). And the electrical problem was fixed. Decent prices. Liked the offer to see old parts that were taken off and point to where the problem was  on the car. Gives you a better sense that good work was done.  They do offer a discount for making a review. However, the discount is only for the next visit. I wish that I would have known so I could have saved a bunch since this bill wasn't all that cheap.

They've always had what I've needed even though I generally try to stay away from pool box stores. I test my own water and do my own maintenance so any time I go in I get what I need and take off - no talking me into chemicals I don't need.  Check out the BBB method and save some money.

In April 2012 I tore my ACL. I tried to just let it go (I didn't know) but it persisted. My normal doctor sent me in for an MRI, which came back that the ACL was indeed torn. Off to the Orthpedic folk.  Dr Dungy saw me and I must admit, he was quite personable. He doesn't have that holier than though doctor attitude.  With that said, I wished he was a little more upfront with what my options were. I'm just a laymen and I don't know what I need. Let me explain - my ACL is torn but it generally doesn't buckle or anything. It is generally constantly tight and thus I don't do any bowling, hiking, or running anymore in fear of hurting it. Because it wasn't causing me any bad discomfort he kind of steered me in the way of physical therapy. However, from what I'm reading if I ever want to do any of the above activities my only real chance is surgery as ACLs never heal. Physical therapy is only good to strengthen the muscles and tissues around the ACL to hold it in place for general activities.  So I'm probably looking at surgery.

I liked this place a lot. I had fun eating outside on the patio. Red and green salsa taste great - but are not hot. I'm a wuss, so this worked out well - the flavors are great on both of them. They make both of them in house as well.  Really, get here. They need more business so they can grow into something even better than they are now!

I've been going here for about 3 years now and never had a problem with them. Along the same lines, I've been attended to by everyone there, I believe.  I've had them give me everything from a buzz cut to a faux hawk to a beard shave.  Their prices are pretty reasonable at $17 for a normal cut (but +$3 on Sundays).   About the only thing I can say "bad" is that if you are looking for a big chat fest, this isn't the place. Everyone there is pretty quiet and just watches the TVs that are along the wall. But then again... this is a barber shop, not a beauty salon!

What is there to say about this place that hasn't already been said? You can make your own or have them make one of their signature creations - all of which are delicious (not that I've ever had them all, but I've never heard anyone say anything even close to a complaint).  Bring your sweet tooth and forget to log your calories after ordering here or you will be be forced to visit the nearest fitness gym before you go home.  4-stars simply because they are expensive.

Stopped in for a few drinks - Kick Flippin Breeze and a Strawberry Breeze. We were seated quickly on the patio as we requested, greeted quickly, and got our drinks quickly. However, after that we sat and sat and sat. I was starting to wonder if we were just going to have to dine-and-dash. I don't think I should have to wait a very long time or go hunt someone down just to pay.  Second, the drinks... while good... may not have had alcohol in them. Either I'm just really an alcoholic or there was no liquor in either of my drinks.  I don't give this often... but I'm going with 2 stars on this.

I was looking for glycerin - the grocery store didn't have it and Walgreens didn't have it. Well, CVS did have it.   In general I avoid CVS and Walgreens because I feel they are pricey... but sometimes they just have what you need that nobody else has.

so far I am working with Earl Feng. Mixed results on all this for my ACL reconstruction. I injured my ACL in 2012. Had a MRI done on it also in 2012 but never did anything with my MRI/knee since it wasn't hurting me in day-to-day activities. But really, I was missing out on sports - I just avoided them and I wanted to change that so I decided that I needed to get the ACL repaired.  Just so you know, human ligaments don't grow back since they don't have blood flow. So if they are broke in 2012 then they will be broke in 2014.  For some strange reason my 2012 MRI results (I even brought in the films) were out of date. So as you'd have it I had to get new ones done through TOCA. I guess I could have argued that this was nonsense for the aforementioned fact but I decided that if someone was going to be cutting me open that it might be better if I follow their system and so they can have everything in *their* file in a manner that they are used to. Luckily I am not paying for this all out of pocket but if you are or if you have a high deductible then this may be something you may want to remember if you are in the same situation as I was in.  In any case, Dr. Feng has been pleasant with me. Even when I came back in for my MRI to be read I felt like when he told me that it was still torn that he "knew" that I knew that it still would be - kind of preaching to the choir type thing.  I am planned to have my actual surgery 11JUN14 so I will have to update at that time.

Showed up at about 9:30pm on a Friday night. The inside room was 100% full and the outside was about 30% full. Stood outside. Nobody came and acknowledged me. Stood inside the doorway. Nobody acknowledged me. Stood at the bar. Nobody acknowledged me. Meanwhile, my date had just grabbed menus from somewhere an sat herself on the patio. By the time i finally got someone i basically said "oh hey, nevermind there she is" so it isnt like we sat somewhere that the staff didnt know about." This ordeal lasted maybe 8 minutes...  Sat down and after about 3 minutes, someone dropped off water. Then another 3-5 minutes passed by and someone came and got drink orders. We got our drinks, finished our drinks, and... you guessed it, nobody. So we hollered at someone that worked there to close our "drink tab." They did and we left.  I'm not sure how long we were there but I'd say an honest 30 minutes between waiting outside like a dork and waiting outside at the table before we called it quits.  To make matters worse, none of the heaters outside were on. Half the time we were there someone was fiddling with it. As it turns out, the last thing you want is a cold date. And before you say it I'm not one who wants a bunch of attention. I don't. But I do want someone to -heaven forbid- seat me and take my order! They looked like they literally had twice the business they were staffed for.  Apparently we weren't the only ones with this experience because a table near us (also outside, family of four) got up, tossed cash on the table, and left. They had it too. The other 4 tables outside with us that were occupied also had no food - and they were all there before we waited around on the sidewalk/lobby/bar waiting for someone to seat us.  I can't stress enough how laid back of a person I am when it comes to dining. No joke, I've had food come to my table with hair in it and I didn't complain. The wrong food was brought to me and I didn't complain. I've had drinks spilled on me and I didn't complain. So to warrant me to rate the place low like this hurts me. But I'm pretty sure most people would have walked away long before I did, some without paying (if you have to get up and track someone down to close your bill...). But the fact is that Blind Pig was attempting to race the figure -8 with a unicycle against legitimate race cars.  The food must be out of this world for it to hold 4 stars with this kind of service.

I've been here for Rockstar Mayhem and for Luke Bryan. What do you get in an outdoor ampitheatre? Well, the heat for starters. And for seconds, bad acoustics. And for thirds, a lot of bands/singers/acts come to this venue during the summer - go figure.  Also, VERY expensive drinks. WTF, $13 for a 20oz can? C'mon.  With that said, I'm more of a pit concert goer or a lawn type person. I don't like to sit in a seat. Boring. If you sit on the lawn expect to have whatever you have sitting on the ground to be kicked 2 rows away. Not the people's fault - it is dark, they are drunk, and your shit blends in with the ground.   Also expect to have NO cell service. You will get it, but it is low. Therefore, your battery will be gone before the concert is over. So when you are wandering around on the lawn trying to find your blanket and your people, don't plan on calling them because everyone's phone was dead. I charged mine to 98% before entering the concert and at the end mine was the only one that was alive at all. The other FIVE people's phones were dead (and other people had their phones fully charged as well). We weren't taking video or anything else, either. If someone told me that the place had a cell phone jammer installed... I wouldn't doubt it for a second.  NO SERVICE. So plan accordingly on how to find your party and plan ahead of how you are meeting to go home.  This place is expensive and I serioulsy thought I spent more time going to the bathroom and aimlessly wondering around the lawn tripping over everyone's shit than I did watching the show. I wish more acts picked other venues... or demanded that the prices aren't so high (like Kid Rock demanding that beer be sold for $4).

Make no mistake about it... Healthy Paws is not a charitable organization. When it comes down to it they are a business first and foremost and if your pet doesn't meet their starting specifications then you are out of luck.  In January 2014 I rescued a Savannah Cat from a terminally ill lady who could no longer care for her. My cat had been through two homes at this point and was not taken care of. I took her in and had a few thousand dollars worth of work done to her out of my own pocket (mainly, teeth all removed and antibiotics). I then applied for insurance through Healthy Paws to which I was accepted ( as they will always accept you as you pay up front and then they will accept/deny your claim later). I took her in for infection and breathing and Healthy Paws denied my claim outright. They even denied the claim for ruptured anal glands.   They said that everything was a "pre-existing condition" and thus denied it all.  For granted, I am not a doctor/vet but I feel like everything could and would have been called pre-existing just for the sake of denying my claim. After all, she was neglected by the prior owners and even when in my care she needed medical care. For me to bring her to the vet for care, then months later apply for insurance, and then go back in probably did seem like me trying to scam them.  I understand their denial in part but I still find it unfortunate that one cannot rescue an animal who has been neglected and get a helping hand to try to make the animal at peace. It is not like I had the animal for 8yrs and suddenly problems set in and then I went "oh shit, I better get someone to help me pay for this." I rescued a sick cat and needed help. I even emailed them before applying and told them my situation. Still to them all was pre-existing.  I paid almost $4k caring for my cat but in the end she need more care than I could afford. This story ends as sad as it can - she needed extensive care and even that care was not guaranteed to completely fix her (she may have suffered brain damage). So in the end I did as much as I could an opted for euthanasia.  If you read the reviews of pet insurance you will notice a trend - people bought insurance long ago and probably never had any issues. After paying $25-$50 a month for nothing for 8 years sure, the insurance would pitch in. It is much like an extended warranty - the sellers hope that you never cash in. The same is true of Healthy Paws - if you buy from them and (in their opinion) think it is too soon or if they can link it to something earlier... then they will deny you.  They aren't charitable in that way.  Beware.

I went last night - Friday night - with a mixed group. Some had never been to a country bar and weren't even into country music while others were huge country fans.  Unfortunately for me I was feeling sick all night on Mill. Too much drinking? Maybe. But I think I was dehydrated from being outside all day. In any case, I wasn't feeling top notch for this experience.  Despite this little fact my girlfriend still thought it would be funny to sign me up for the mechanical bull. I was signed up, called upon, and I rode it - who would ever think of denying a bull ride simply because you feel nauseous before you get on!? Not me.  I had actually never rode a mechanical bull before so I was devirginized last night - while sick. Pretty awesome huh? Yep. I actually didn't think I did that bad, especially in comparison to the other drunks that visited the bull. I do think that the handle rope could have been a tad longer. But hey, mechanical bulls aren't made to be stayed on are they? Nope.  So what is the good? The place is country enough. Mason jars for been mugs. Whiskey. Country music. People wearing boots and Daisy Duke shorts. My drink - a rum and coke - was poured with a mission. I am always the guy who thinks that drinks are poured too weak and even this drink was poured to make me pucker (I'd rather pucker than get a drink where I question if there is liquor in the drink). There were plenty of country hotties and even a few cowboys there.  What is bad? Well, there is a long line to get in. This isn't anything new for this building - every place that has resided here has always had a line. It is generally the only place to really dance at on Mill (maybe School of Rock, also) so it naturally gets busy. I actually bypassed the line last night by getting a smokeless tobacco sample, which scored me a free drink. For the most part country bars don't have the line outside thing. The line outside thing is more for show - "we are so popular that you have to wait" - that is more akin to Vegas or Scottsdale. So if waiting in line for country isn't your thing then this isn't your place. Likewise, if bros wearing RVCA shirts turns your country spirit off, then this also is not your place. The only thing I can personally knock this place for is that it was hot. But hey, this is a bar open to the outside. I didn't like it because I was feeling like hell. But at the same time it made it feel more country to me - country folk don't mind being hot. I just happened to be deliriously dehydrated hot, which meant that a busy hot bar wasn't helping. :)  I'll put it this way... if you want more of a true country bar then maybe Denim and Diamonds on a Saturday would be more on par with you (Wednesdays attract more city-slicker country people due to drink specials). If you simply want some country... or to dance... then this is a great place to go despite the homeboys and bros that will be there. In all honesty, who cares what they are wearing or what they seem to be to you - enjoy the music and grab a chick and learn to 2-step.

Before I even bust this review out you have to understand that I love country music and I love country bars, even if they are on Mill and most people are there to booze it and don't even care for country music.  With that said, I'm not sure if I should add Moonshine to my shit list (do not attend) or not. I came with a friend from out of town and when getting my ID checked one of the door attendants saw that I still had my pocket knife on my pants (like many country type people). They said that I could check it in with them and obtain it when I left. Since this is a possibility with firearms I figured it was worth doing so I didn't have to go back to the car to drop it off.  Short story made long - when I went back an hour later and asked for my knife and it was not given to me. I was given *a* knife, but it wasn't mine. I told them as such and they just shrugged their shoulders as if it wasn't their problem.  I found it to be very unprofessional. If Moonshine doesn't want "weapons" at their establishment then that is fine - either make the check-in official by a manager with a receipt or ask the patron to secure the item offsite. It angers me that they are willy-nilly checking in items. For granted, it is my fault for not getting a receipt but why even have this informal check-in policy?   I wrote the manager about my issue and received no response whatsoever despite giving them multiple methods of contacting me. I would guess that I am not the first one to have this happen to them.  Other than this issue, it seems they never really have any drink specials either. I'll stick to Denim or elsewhere if I want my country fix.

*Crying* I actually really like Zipps. I went there quite often during the March Madness.  They just opened and I haven't really had any of the bad service that others have described. I've opened or helped open various restaurants and every place is going to have growing/opening pains. That is just how it is! I wouldn't give up on it quite yet folks. If the other Zipps around the valley are of any indication, then they will shape up soon.

I used to be a Scottsdale rat, but I quit that habit. Now I am more of a social Scottsdale drinker. I'll blame the girlfriend... she doesn't like going out and dancing and checking scantily clad women out. But really, this place is pretty cool for what it is. If you are wanting to get your 2-step on, stay away. I'd vote this place a BOMB for actual dancing. The floor is small and everyone there is not really "country dancing" anyways. This is Scottsdale - you twerk to anything including when the DJ equipment goes awry and is just static. If you want to country dance then head over to Denim and Diamonds (Mesa) or Whiskey Rose Saloon (Phoenix) - IMHO those have far better dance floors and more actual country happenings going on.  On the bright side if you come here to DBWR the bartenders will know how to make you a watered-down vodka-cran. The other places only know how to pop a beer or our you straight whiskey. Just messing, but this is Scottsdale - home to some of the worst bartenders who's life goals are to serve you water with a splash of your choice alcohol for $10.  With that all said, I still liked this place.

Whelp, there goes that 4-star review. If I had the ability I would give you 0-stars Mr. Bentley.  Let's go ahead and jump into this review. First off, I have been a Scottsdale rat since 2007. With the exception of 2013 I generally was the guy who knew all the places and their events. I was a promoter that wasn't a promoter - I was the guy who everyone asked to be their "guide" for Scottsdale since I knew where to get good deals and where the fun times were in Scottsdale. I knew bartenders and could, probably, get a few free drinks or discounts most places I went.  I guess I lost my touch since I stepped away for a year.  My experience on 20DEC13 was terrible. What was terrible? Well, I never even got inside so I can't even comment on the bar or anything else. So what could I be so angry about? Well, I'm mad about "classic Scottsdale," that's what.  This may sound a bit funny to most but I've always said that everyone could embody the EDM and country music scene then the world would be a better place. to me those two types of music exhibit some of the best human qualities - good times, respect, loyalty, love, unity, and friendship. So needless to say I like country music and I was excited to see that Scottsdale was getting more country there and for that matter, so was Phoenix (it seems like there isn't a lot of country bars here).  So what did I experience here last week? The worst type of Scottsdale douchebaggery I've ever seen. For starters, there were three lines. Most places have two - general and VIP. I totally understand this - if you paid extra for a bottle or a table or whatever then by all means go to the front of the line and get expressed in. However, what the fuck is this third, middle, line?  Well, I'll tell you what it was, it was the douchebag express line of greasers. Half those fuckers greased their way in. And if you don't know what greasing is, it is paying the bouncer to get in without wait. No checking ID, no wait, no nothing... just money... and go in. Even the damn VIP line who had tables and shit were getting held out! WTF!? The bouncers probably made bank there - probably more than I make at my engineering job in a week.  If this was some sort of swanky Scottsdale lounge then fine. But this is mother'fn country. Again, a place that I feel should embody respect. Every cowboy and cowgirl should be treated equally.   You know what the kicker was? My group and I even tried to grease our way in... the response? Our grease price wasn't high enough. Well holy hell, we have a high-rolling badass here (and BTW, we didn't offer no $20 either!)  We ended up waiting in the general line for about an hour. We got to the front and saw this absolute madness up-close and personal and said fuck it and jumped out of line and went over to Majerles where the bartender over there respected us and didn't skimp on the drinks at all.  I'm going to write Dierks personally and see if he knows or care what a melting-pot of douchebaggery his restaurant/pub/club has become.

Seriously, why in the heck am I updating this review when I vowed to never come back here after blacklisting this place. Well, as you have it I went to Scottsdale last weekend and the group outvoted me so I played along (not without a drunken rant about how anywhere in Scottsdale is better than Whiskey Row).  In general, my opinion still stands of Whiskey Row. There was still three lines but this time we did get in. And as you have it we did try to grease our way in but were denied (just so you know, the going rate is +$20 per person). Just for the record I wanted no part in greasing my way into an establishment that I didn't want to go into anyways but my group tried anyways - you know how much more alcohol you can buy for $20 at some of the "less popular" places in Scottsdale? Yeah, I know that I sound like an alcoholic so leave me alone.  In any case we did get in. The place is a swamp both figuratively and literally. When I was finally admitted in I headed straight for the restroom. First off, line for the dudes. Not many places can claim this but WR does it quite well. Always a line, and this is of course completely true for the ladies too. My girlfriend reported that the women's bathroom was flooded. Gross. Nothing like a bunch of catty broads swimming their way through the bathroom - hope you wore a miniskirt and not your $200 boot cut  jeans! In short I can't believe that Whiskey Row has such a small bathroom. No thanks.  The dance floor is an absolute joke. JOKE. It is nothing more than a clusterfuck and I am pretty sure I have more room in my family room than this dance floor. Add in everyone hammmered drunk and this is a bonafide disaster. No thanks.  Once out of the bathroom we tried to get a drink at the bar. Nope. Slow service. And not only that... no Coors or Budweiser. What the hell? Where the hell am I? how the hell do you not have those two domestics... not even in bottle? WTF? What the hell is everyone drinking in here - catfish water? No thanks.  In short, there is still nothing appealing to me about this place - you have long waits to get in, the dance floor is one of the worst (even for bullshit dancing, much less country dancing), the bar is slow, the bar is dry, the bathrooms are dirty, and the drink prices aren't all that appealing. The only thing this place has going for it is that it plays country - and I love country.  Final result - this place is on my perma-perma ban list. If my party wants to go here they can but I'll go somewhere else by myself before going back in here.

I lived in a condo that was eventually managed by World Class Properties (First by Arrowhead).  I had lived there for 4 years. I ensured that I was present for my exit walk-through. I wanted to see anything that they were going to notate as deficient so that I didn't get charged some exotic fee for something stupid. Rocky came out to do the inspection (he actually used to work for Arrowhead) and he did a quick walk-through and said it all looked good. A few weeks later I get a letter from the property owner saying that I am only getting $390/$1095 of my deposit back. I got charged for everything at their inflated prices. As part of the original contract with Arrowhead I paid for exit carpet cleaning, but guess what, I got charged again for it on the exit at a tune of $120. I'm sorry, but why did I pay for it up front, and then at the end? Not only that, but every day I hear carpet cleaning specials to do your entire house for $80 (i.e. Zerorez). Of course, painting cost hundreds ( I scrubbed all the walls down, all of them), and they even charged me for oil on the garage floor. Damn, WTF? What do you want me to do, park in the street? I cleaned all the appliances with a fine tooth comb, and they said they had to clean that stuff too. In all, I spend 3 weeks cleaning that place only to have them come back and say it needed to all be done again. If I had known that they intended to charge me for everything then I would have just moved my furniture out, vacuumed, and then mailed them the damn keys - especially since everything was supposedly kosher at the exit walk-through. Don't say everything is OK if you intend on raping me a week later.  I understand that they want their property back in the same condition they gave it in... but there is this thing called normal-wear-and-tear. Problem is, most of these shitty ass companies know that most people won't fight them in Small Claims court so they do it and get away with it.

I called up and got a car while mine was in the shop. I know that many times they have "weekend" specials at a discounted rate and also "my car is in the shop" rates but neither was mentioned to me. I suppose if I had really hammered down and haggled with them then I could have tried to get those rates but I didn't. I did use them to drop me back off at the shop. Overall good experience.

Good times. For $35 you get to drink from 1 until 6pm. While the ticket only permits 20 samples, most vendors don't bother checking off your sheet. Lots of variety so bring your tastebuds! Lots of free gear too!

I always run in and just use the self-serve station. As another reviewer stated - so many times everyone in line is an absolute hot mess - so it is just easier for me to just hammer out the transaction on the machine.

I called around and SafePro Glass was the lowest. Their competitor beat them by $5, and then SafePro came back with an extra $2 off. Sure, I'll take that.  Maria helped me while in shop. Everyone there was pretty nice and came in to check on me, etc.  Window was replaced and I took off. I rolled the window down and noticed that the motor was labored. I pulled over and noticed that the window would not go all the way down. I rolled it back up and the window does not roll into the groove (it rolls up OUTSIDE the door).  I drove back and talked to the manager/supervisor and he said "that isn't right." He sent an installer out and the installer said that the wrong brackets were on it. I could come back Monday, but I couldn't so Thursday it is.  I would think that part of the installation would be to roll the window up and   OTHER: When I got in my car I was greeted with a somewhat messy area. There was a bent antenna left on the floor (installation tool?) as well as some sort of gasket (maybe surrounding the new window so it doesn't get dinged up?) I also have my cell phone holder that is now missing one of the feet that hold the phone to the holder. Also, my LED light in my door is disconnected.  As of right now I'm not all that impressed with the work. We will see if come Thursday if they get it right.

Rex, the CEO, made this transaction worthwhile in the end.  He ended up leaving a very lengthy voice-mail - he was embarrassed and assured me that he would personally see me through. And believe it or not, he did personally see it through.  I work night shift - I am not the easiest person to get a hold of. he left numerous messages and kept trying. Much appreciated. Most people call and *maybe* leave a message and then it is up to me. Nope, Rex kept calling trying to catch me. We played phone tag for a little bit and finally linked up.  He personally came to my house with an installer and stayed there the entire time when my window was being replaced. Come to find out, the bolts were the main culprit - they weren't tight. The cracking noise when rolling down was more-or-less- because the window was torquing against the regulator rail. The installer (sorry, I didn't catch your name) also greased up the rails to allow the regulator to slide easier. So all was well on that front - we didn't have to put in a new piece of glass as the new torqued screws (with some washers) allowed the window to roll up properly. If the work was going to be extended, he even offered me to use his vehicle, which of course I declined.  In all truth, all I wanted was my window to work. I like to roll down the window and fell the breeze - especially now when the air doesn't feel like you put your head in an oven or cold where you frost up. But Rex wanted to make sure that I was happy. I repeatedly told him that all I wanted was a working window but he kept going. Whether it was because he truly was embarrassed about the service I received or he simply knew that a negative review could hurt... he wanted to make good on anything that went wrong with me. Truly, he went above what I was asking - I'm pretty easy going.  As for the phone holder that one of the feet was broken off, he got me a new one of those. Actually he paid me more than it was worth. Rex, I swear to you that once I get it I will be sending you the difference of money - you gave me way too much.  To make good on the bad service he tinted my new window. He even offered to pay for the entire car to be re-tinted, but I declined because that isn't what I am about. The car looks great now though with it's new window and tint.  Last but not least, in hopes of future business he gave me free windshield repair if I ever need it.  I am tempted to give the final review of 4-stars due to the original service but really, how often do you write a letter where the CEO himself handles it down to the point where he repeatedly calls and then ultimately comes out, shakes your hand, talks to you, and stays until the job is done? Well, never. Businesses these days are all about the dollar and if they can screw the pooch and it only loses a few customers here then so be it. He could have easily have ignored my letter and laughed at me - he had my money and I had a window so the deal was good. I also took multiple weeks to finally "complain" about my service. Was I past my statue of limitations? Maybe. If he did  want to address my issues he could have handed me off to one of his assistants but instead he handled it himself. In my opinion it takes a big man that runs the biggest window business in Arizona to come down and talk directly to the customer. Even when the window issue was fixed he could have left it at that (I am pretty sure I made it clear that I was happy with just the window, but he insisted on the rest). In fact, I'm kind of embarrassed that the main issue was more the bolts than the actual window (not the first window, the first window was definitely jacked up and rolled up outside the car).  In any case you just don't find customer service like this. Take away the tint, window repair, and the over-payment of the phone holder and I'd still give Rex 5 stars. I'm really impressed that he personally came out and saw it through - I know he was busy too.  And remember... if you want your windshield repaired and are going to do it through insurance then you get $50-$150 rebated (don't quote me on that, but feel free to mention me as a referral. *chuckles*).

I went to Oasis for my ACL replacement surgery.  In general all seemed to go well on the surgery. The procedure was done and I have not had any complications as of yet (~23 days out from surgery). So I can only assume that the staff is coherent and clean (sorry, I was knocked out so I can't judge).  The only thing I can knock them for is scheduling. I was originally scheduled for a 2pm surgery. Then the day before thy called to confirm and said it was scheduled for 4pm (didn't even mention that it was moved, just confirmed a different time). Then at 11am on surgery day they called and asked if I wanted to come in early (which I didn't since I was not allowed to drive myself in and had made plans for someone to get me). Then I get there for my 4pm surgery and I am not taken back for my surgery at 6pm.  My point is that you can't change times on the fly. With a surgery such as mine you have to arrange for someone to drive you there. If you and your driver are waiting at home, fine. But if you are asking people to take off work or drive over to pick you up this is not efficient at all. Then if they are driving you home, and you have surgery 4 hours after the original time then this could potentially mess up your schedule for getting home, etc.  This is all aggravating and luckily I had someone pick me up that was flexible with their time and had someone to pick me up that was flexible with their time.  TIME MANAGEMENT: 2 STAFF: 5 OPERATION: 5 CLEANLINESS: 5

Fired Pie is a great little joint that feels like they care  what goes into their food. Herbivores and carnivores alike can find something they like, whether it be a pizza or a salad.  Pizza comes thin, but not completely crunchy. I actually prefer thick pizza, but this place is a very happy medium on the crunch level.  I think it is best to just order a pizza by selecting toppings as you go, much in the same way you would order at Subway. I do think that adding olive oil to the crust is pretty awesome.  Place can get pretty busy!  I'll be back.

I could have swore that I wrote a review of this place but apparently not (I even remember taking pictures).   I had an MRI at this location shortly after I tore my ACL in 2012. The whole process was completely painless - check in, wait, go back, get the scan, wait, get your films, and then leave.  The place was clean and easy to understand. Everyone was helpful towards me.

This was my last meal in 2015 and it was good.  The girlfriend had never had sushi but I talked her into it. She is a vegetarian so she got a cucumber roll and absolutely loved it. Note she asks to go get sushi all the time.  I hope those people got off in time to go celebrate NYE!

I've always enjoyed Bei, but today was possibly the last time I come here. I came in to order carry-out. I could have called in an order but to be honest, I didn't know what I wanted. Plus, orders at any sushi place normally come out pretty quick. Not today.  I arrived slightly before 5:00pm. Made my order of three vegetarian sushi rolls. Order came out at 5:27pm. All in all, about a 40min wait time. Seeing as how I didn't order anything crazy (just straight off the menu), nothing tempura, and no meat that needed cooked... why would it take 40 minutes to get me three rolls with vegetables on them?  The place wasn't busy - maybe 3 small groups of people in the restaurant. So I can't make myself say that they were just slammed and my order was down the list due the sheer volume of food they were putting out. No, they were just ungodly slow.  As I sat there I was wondering if I was dining in if they would have had me wait that long.  In any case, I guess I'm off to look for another sushi place in my area.

This place is pretty close to me so I decided to go here on a hungry whim. I managed to hit happy hour and got some good food for pretty good prices. I can't rant or rave about the food being awesome or sub-par but it was good. Plenty good to return another time.  The service was pretty good too - server didn't pester me nor did they leave me in the dust. This seems like a pretty cool little neighborhood place to dine at.

So after almost blacklisting and adding both El Hefe's to my "Pot-o-doucheebaggery" Yelp list I ended up visiting BOTH locations this week - the Scottsdale location on Wednesday and the Tempe location on Friday. I must have been in the mood to forgive this week.  So to start, I am guessing that el hefe is a spin on the word el jefe, which means THE BOSS in Spanish. I learned this on my cab ride to El Hefe when I said, "Do you know where we are going... el hefe" and him and my brother started laughing and said, "yes I am listening." They told me that it sounded like I was calling him the boss. Dammit, I need to brush up on my Spanish.  So anyways, el jefe dropped us off at El Hefe. We got there at 10 something and the line was about 8 people deep. One thing that really turned me off about the Hefe previously was that the line there was always effing ridiculous. We got lucky Friday because by the time we got in and ordered a beer, the line was already probably 50 people deep and remained that way  for the rest of the night. With that said, the bouncers seemed to try to get people in quickly and the place didn't seem overtly packed.  There was enough room for me to get my dance on out on the patio and to sneak over and photobomb someone's photo (which he tried to kick me out of the way). Which BTW - sir, please send me that picture! (JK). I did get on the dance floor a few times but it was a little too packed for me. I don't mind it being packed, but I prefer to bump uglies with females if we are going to get that close. :) Honestly though, I enjoy any dance floor where people are having fun - I don't care who you are. I'm more of a PLUR-kid - peace, love, unity, and respect!  As far as the dance floor went, one true complaint that I had was that there wasn't enough zebra going on. I saw it come out for a bit and then it disappeared. WHERE DID YOU GO MY LOVER!? Who doesn't like getting beat up by a zebra on the dance floor whilst drinking? So note to management, make sure the zebra doesn't get put away! Whoever was on the decks that night spun a great set too. As I alluded to earlier, my favorite music is EDM and that is pretty much the flavor they played all night.  The crowd was far from my prior douchebag experiences. I was impressed, yes IMPRESSED, that they let some people dressed up in (one as Gumby, the other I don't remember). Hell yes, Gumby is here to party! This was a welcome change after a previous experiences left me at odds with the bouncer after being told that I was out of dress code (my pant legs touched the ground, but weren't ragged). I got to talk to a lot of people and nobody seemed like they were too good to talk to. Kudos.  The main bar seemed pretty efficient. I could always get in and get a drink and not feel like I had to totally hustle people to get in there. The bartenders were quick, poured well, and were friendly. The biggest drawback (and the reason that I am giving 4 stars instead of 5) is the lack of good prices. While they weren't outrageous... it is just that I love... you hear this management... I LOVE when a place charges whenever they want to charge for everything, but put something on some special deal. You can cycle it or have it always the same - make it something stupid if you want - cans of Natural Light for $1.50? That crap is terrible, but I'll be the guy buying 18 of them... which will then make me want to buy shots to compliment it. I know that this type of scheme isn't something that everyone likes to participate in, but there are plenty of us that would trade a little quality for quantity, especially if our primary objective is to get nice and drunk and for cheap. Even if you didn't want to do Natty Light... then have some sort of specials. People love feeling like they are getting something at a discount. Kudos to you for having the liquors to make a Alabama Slammer too - nobody seems to stock Sloe Gin.  Another drawback, although minor, is the bathrooms. When the place gets busy a bouncer normally throttles the line to get into the bathrooms, but this sucks because he holds people back and creates a bottleneck that goes into the dance floor. So you have people waiting in line for the bathroom, people on the dance floor, and people just trying to get through the crowd to go outside or get to their table. The line throttling is needed - don't get me wrong - otherwise the bathroom would turn into an absolute cluster-fk due to the design. But is there another way to be more efficient without making that nasty bottleneck? Also, in the guy's bathroom, there is that one urinal that nobody can use because it is in that weird corner where you pretty much have to put one leg on your neighbor's urinal and one on the wall (this urinal did have a bag over it so I'm not sure if it was broke or they were just recognizing the absurdity of the urinal).  So in summary: FOOD: N/A MUSIC: 5/5 BATHROOM: 4/5 LAYOUT: 3/5 BARTENDERS: 5/5 PRICES: 4/5 CROWD: 5

How can one give a Firehouse sub less than 4 stars? I've never had any problem at this location or any other location.  the only reason I can see Firehouse having issues is if they are just opening. Trying to train a bunch of 16yr olds how to make subs on a line is difficult and things are going to go wrong. This location is new so maybe that was part of their gowing pains!  Can't go wrong with many of these subs, FTW!

Alright, so I've successfully came here both for the nightlife AND the Ohio-backer bar experience. I will attempt to review them separately.  Here is the short version for the nightlife version of the bar. Aesthetically nice. Very expensive drinks. Shit layout. Bouncers will knock you over like a linebacker if they need by to make way for bottle service, to silence a fight, or go get a girls number he's been eyeballing all night. Little to no place to sit or stand unless you have a table.  Here is the short version for the Ohio-backer version of the bar. Same expensive drinks. Nice HD TVs of the game EVERYWHERE. Shit-tons of Ohio Buckeye peeps. Absolutely nowhere to sit or stand unless you got there 3 hours before the game or reserved a table.  Long version for both the above. At night there are a ton of people packed in this place. Which is nice - nobody wants to be in an empty club on Friday or Saturday night. However, it is a legit, straight-up struggle to get anywhere in here... sober or drunk. The place is kind of separated into two bars - one bar kind of outside and the other is inside and lines the dance floor. To go between the two you have to wiggle through a door that is lined and packed with people. To go to the bathroom you at the very least have to struggle through the dance floor, if not through the door and the dance floor.   The music was good. I like to dance so I was happy to stay on the dance floor and avoid the door. However, I didn't start there and the few times I tried to "walk a lap" or go round up a lost friend it was pretty much, as we called it in the military "nut to butt formation." The line around the place moved slow and so you were forced to hump the person in front of you and be humped by whoever was behind you. As you can imagine as the night goes on... and the alcohol has been flowing this can be interesting to give and receive. I don't really have a personal bubble (see previous comment about the military) so that didn't really bother me but I'd guess people that have a personal space bubble or claustrophobia might not like this. Oh, and if you don't like drinks spilled on you or knocked out of your hand while walking through, this also might nit be like you. In fact, now that I think about it... it was kind of running a gauntlet with 50 other people where everyone tries to knock you over or knock crap out of your hand as you pass.  This includes the bouncer at the door who feels the need to break up a fight with the other 18 bouncers at the rear of the bar... only he gets the magical authority to hit you like you are a tackle dummy on the ASU practice field. No apologies. Just wear your drink you lil bitch... and enjoy it.  That is a literal true story, BTW.  I have no idea how many times I saw, had friends, or experienced getting hit with drinks in my hand. It was like, cool, I got my drink... and someone would get a signal that they were required to barge down the aisle so that when you turned around they'd hit your drink. Again, no apologies. I also was standing by a table and some guy full force ran and tripped over a step (the tables are elevated) and seriously punched the drink out of my girlfriends hand and let the drink... and glass... rain down on the crowd like some rap video "making it rain."  Again, no apologies... much less a "oh shit, I spilled your drink... I'll buy you a new one." Good thing my girlfriend is a sport and I'm not a douche and I didn't knock him out.  In any case, it kind of reminds me of a frat party that is trying to be high-class. The place is nice but it turns into a disaster as the night goes on. People seem to have checked their manners at the door.  The other side of this place is that they are an Ohio State Buckeyes backer bar. Like, all the alumni go there... banner hanging outside and everything. Merchandise is sold at the door. This is supposedly one of the bigger Ohio backer bars in Phoenix. And if you don't know, there are a lot of us Buckeyes here in the valley... and yes, they are all there packed in when the Bucks play. But man, it is the same problem as the night story - no room and expensive. With games lasting 3 hours, who wants to stand there? Purely insane people and people with tables, that's who. No thanks for me. I love partying with my fellow Bucks but I like to have an inkling of comfort in doing it. So I went across the street to District and enjoyed the game there... and when Blonde did the songs and chants... I just did it from across the street. I wasn't the only Buck to do the same.  So what is the conclusion on all this? If you want to party... like you're in a frat and on a budget go to Giligins. If you want higher class then go to the District or Hi-Fi. Higher yet, then maybe Mint, Maya, or Cake? If you want to go to a backer bar then I find Buffalo Wild Wings on Gilbert/ Warner to be awesome as it has tables, prizes, and you will still have the same crazy Buckeye atmosphere.

I had my left ACL replaced on 11JUN14. On 27JUN14 I was released to start my physical therapy.  Being a bit "handicapped" I wanted to take my physical therapy somewhere close. I had seen the Ignite building many times as it was pretty much across teh street from me so I decided to go there.  Funny story, I actually looked up physical therapists on my insurance list for who was on their list. I was in a rush and found Kinect Physical Therapy on the map (also just off Riggs), called, and made an appointment. I showed up at Ignite for my "appointment" to which they kindly said that I was not in the system. I figured that maybe something got missed... then as I was filling out the normal paperwork it dawned on me that I was at the wrong place. I confirmed with Ignite that I was covered under my insurance and then called Kinect to say that I wouldn't be with them. Ignite is the place that I wanted - they had good reviews on Yelp as well as being super close to me so I stuck with them.  Sorry Kinect!  I am now about 3 weeks into my treatment at Ignite. I have worked with or been worked on by Joe (Physical Therapist), Ashley (Technician), and Tara (Occupational Therapist). The short story on them is that they are great all around.  As for treatment they have a nice blend of hands-on therapy (i.e. massages), manual exercises for you to do yourself (i.e. heel slides, stationary bike), and technology (i.e. ultrasound, laser, electrical muscle stimulation). I have done other therapy for other ailments and the blend ratio was much different than here (i.e. all manual exercises, etc.). The multi-directional approach, at least to me, seems sound and I personally appreciate it. I feel that there are some things that are better served by manual exercises over technology and vice-versa. And let us face the facts, nobody wants to go in somewhere, pay money (insurance or not) just to be given manual exercises that they could probably look up online and do at home.  As an added bonus all the other patients there are friendly too. As you may have guessed you end up getting on similar schedules and start seeing the same people all the time... which is kind of cool. Since I am stuck at home with my leg I have been designated as the babysitter so I've had to take them into Ignite. All the workers there are kid-friendly so as long as your kids can be self-sustaining and respectful then Ignite wouldn't mind them be there. Just make sure that they don't decide to sit on their sandwich like my son did.  The place seems to make good use of their floor as well. They have multiple tables along the wall where 80% of the work seems to take place and then exercise equipment in the middle and then some free-weights and mats along the wall. See the pictures. Furthermore they also have two rooms with doors just in-case you want a massage (by their in-house massage therapist, Kyle) or you are a little shy about showing skin for any treatment that requires you to lift your shirt/pants (i.e. laser treatment), I haven't seen anyone use that but I do want to make it known that there is an option if that is something that concerns you.  A few little random things to wrap this review up. They do seem clean as well. Doing the exercises does get you a little sweaty on the tables and the tables are cleaned right there in front of you. Again, nice to see. They also have a TV to watch and if nothing is on/playing then they usually just have Pandora or something playing.  All-in-all, a great place. I am happy with them so far and I will update this review if anything changes.

Let's be honest about this service... and Vegas. Vegas wants to get women into their club. That is why even without a promoter women pay less to get in, they get VIP entrance, and sometimes free expedited VIP entrance all for free. All of this while us guys are stood outside and forced to pay premium.  That is just Vegas...  And before I get into my review... "Anything Nightlife" is also called "Free Vegas Club Pass" and is ran by Lee Smith. This is a different company than "Free Vegas Club Passes" that is ran by Chris Hornak (see the sneaky difference?). Chris is - I believe - the original and the biggest Vegas promoter and Lee seems to be simply riding on his coattails... and deceiving people along the way.  So with that said this service by Anything Nightlife (also "Free Vegas Club Pass" if deception is the goal) may be valid but all they are really doing is playing middleman between you and the club. They may strike some sort of deal for you and then strike a commission with the club for getting people inside. Even if the club cuts their door price or table price in half for the promoter... the club are still making hand-over-fist on their drinks (e.g. Grey Goose at TotalWine is $23 for 750mL, table at Hakkasan is $3k for one bottle, XS is $1500 for an outside table, $1000 for LIGHT - respective markups being 12,000%, 6,400% and 4,300% which is plenty for a club to give a promoter a cut to ensure that all tables are occupied, every night). Even so, I strongly suggest checking the actual website for bottle services before going with Anything Nightlife (for example, I was quoted $1k for LIGHT but the LIGHT website had it for $800).  So, if you are a group of all girls - you are MONEY. You can get in wherever, whenever and get some sort of massive discount. if you are a group that is 1:1 then this service may be of help to you. If you have more guys than girls then the girls may be helped, but the guys probably won't get the same discount/service that the girls did even though you're in the same group. And heaven forbid you have a group of all guys (bachelor or stag) - you aren't getting any love at all.  Very few all-guy groups are going to get much attention with this type thing... or in Vegas in general. If you do, then it will be on Anything Nightlife's terms, not yours (you will go to whatever club isn't popping that they still have spots available). I was told to come back when I got girls in my Bachelor Party group (see screen shots).  I can't completely knock the service because it is what it is just as Vegas is what it is. I just wish that they were more up-front with these facts so that they didn't have to waste their time... or yours... with false hopes that they would somehow be able to squeak you in with some miraculous deal even though you do not have the optimal ratio of men to women (aka, all women).  Response time: 5/5 Helpfulness: 0/5 Truthfulness: 1/5 (they told me to come back when I had some girls)

I'm not picky about my hair. I've done super Cuts. I've cut my own hair. I've never asked whoever was cutting my hair to change it even if it was jacked up. I judge the time to cut my hair by how messy it is when I take off my work uniform hood - if it looks totally jacked then it is time to cut it. I've had everything from a shaved bald head to Hanson hair. Unlike many guys, I don't feel the need to get my hair cut on a set schedule. This is my disclaimer - I'm not a barber connoisseur.  With that said, I do like places where "guys can be guys" and one of those places is the barber shop (get your head out of the gutter, I'm not talking about strip clubs). I think that charm is lost in places like Super Cuts. What I mean by all this is a place where guys can come for some sort of friendship and BS about whatever is on their mind - sports, girls, family, jobs, or just their date that night and be more assured to have that "male bonding" of another dude. Not the chest-beating male bonding found in the gym or at the bar... but more of an old-school bonding... with your barber. Some guy who is part of the community.  Admittedly, I am a little too young to really remember any of this as I feel like many of these places died off decades ago in exchange for chains where being cheap is more important than comradeship. No many "Tom's Barber Shop" where you could count on Tom being there to give you a trim or to give you advice about your upcoming date or talk sports with you. So my judgement is more of what I've seen in movies.  I feel that EMG kind of is different in that way. All the barbers are talking with their chaired patrons and other chaired patrons. Everyone is talking sports, girls, sports, or whatever. guys in the waiting room are chiming in and the barbers are all talking with them too. I've been to other barber shops where even talking to your barber seems awkward, much less everyone there. And talking at one of the chains is not happening either. Sure, you won't have a busty blonde chick leaning over to trim your bangs like you do at Sport Clips... nor will you have one of their packages... but you will have that smaller feeling of an old school shop.  The price is about average, with it maybe being a touch higher than other places especially considering there isn't any sort of packages like you can get at Sport Clips. If you can, bring cash. It helps out small businesses with their operating costs.  Here is the down and dirty on the place though - getting in is a bit old school too. On weekdays they will take appointments or walk-ins, but if you walk-in be ready to wait a long time especially if there is only one barber there. Even if you make an appointment, you very well may be waiting. So if you're a busy person or don't like to wait, this may be a huge negative for you. On the weekends they do not take appointments, so keep this in mind too. I would like to see Tony figure out a more modern or formalized method of scheduling appointments.  EDIT: In my original review I yearned for a more formalized method of scheduling apointments. Tony listened and got a webpage. Now, as of today (30JUL16), you can now book appointments online. I have not utilized the online booking so I cannot vouch for it. I will write an update once I do.

A Vivint representative came by my house on 15JUL14. They talked me through how SRP was being regulated to have more of their power from solar and that the government had released grants to have solar installed on personal residences at no charge to the residents to meet their regulated solar quota. Supposedly SRP sent out some notice about this but I don't recall ever getting it.  I also looked up this initiative/mandate and really couldn't find anything. Hmpf.  Reduced electric bills are something that everyone should want - green or not - so naturally I was interested. I entertained the representative - I signed up for them to come out and survey my house/roof to see where and how they could install panels for 17JUL14 from 14:00 to 17:00.  No call. No show.  I don't know about you, but if a company can't even show up to survey your house when they say they will be there then I'm not really sure if you want them installing stuff on your roof or being your power company.  Furthermore, their practices reminded me of my experience with Moxie pest control. A Moxie representative came around and part of their sell was to list off other residents who also had ordered down to the point of pointing them out and calling their names out. I don't care for this practice - I don't have any right to know who is getting what done to their house and I don't think a business has any right to disclose that information either. If your product/service is good enough then it should speak for itself.  You shouldn't have to throw a power of numbers guilt trip on me to get me to jump on the bandwagon.  It seems that other Yelp reviews for Vivint (used to be a security company) are also bad, even down to BBB complaints. So if they are the same company, you may want to do your research before jumping in bed with them. The initiative may be real but it doesn't seem to me that Vivint is too serious about doing what they say.  EDIT: I received a call on Thursday saying I missed my appointment. I also came home to find a door hanger saying they missed me. I went home and found the paperwork and it clearly stated "Wednesday 17th." Again, same thing applies as before - if you can't keep your appointments straight then this really hurts your credibility.

Showed up at 7pm on a Tuesday which to me seems like one of the slowest days of the week for any restaurant. However it was not a slow night even though it was not a full house there (about half the tabkes occupied). I may be wrong but it seemed like only one server/hostess was working the floor. Like another reviewer said... it took them a few minutes to acknowledge that we were there, then we sat ourselves outside, then we waited another 10 minutes for them to come get drink orders... and that is when we were warned that it would be an hour before our food order would be started on due to orders inside and take-out orders. Since we had 3 kids and it was a school night we jumped ship.  So I cant judge the food but this new place needs work on managing its customer workload. For a place that was half full it doesnt bode well with people to wait an hour for food, much less the time just to be seated and drinks/orders taken. And I say this as someone who generally views dining out as an event rather than a 5 minute face-cram, serve me NOW.  I would like to see this little unique spot succeed but if they have time management issues like this then I feel they are going to have a steep hill to climb to be successful.

*** EDIT: Not sure why, but I made the update to the location and they moved my review to the old location and deleted it here. They even took my new picture and attached it to the old location. ***  I believe this is a new location first of all. It is in the same general location as the old one though?  In any case the front desk girls were helpful and quick to get us signed up despite being a walk-in. I am not sure how much faster it would be with an appointment but im guessing that they fit you in as they can around the appointments.  All the appointments online were full.

This is a review for BB's nightlife. I came here to close out my night of bar hopping on Mill. I can't say much pro or con about the place. As it has been in the past - it has a nice back outside patio with comfortable chairs. It wasn't crowded so you could sit anywhere. Met some cool people back there too. Only had one drink there so I can't really comment on the food or drink prices.

You know what sucks? When you are psyched up to try something and then when you are ready to go, you start feeling down/ill. That is what happened with me and Stufrageous when I met a friend there. I just wasn't 100%. However, with that said, I still loved it!  I got the Mac & Cheese burger, sans tomato and jalapenos. It was delicious. I do admit though, I have a bit of a thing for M&C, so there is that too. I wish I was feeling better so I would have been more inclined to try the fries too. I did get a sample fry with their house sauce, which was delicious (also go it on my burger).  I felt like the place was kind of a build it as you want it kind of place. I don't know their limits, but I felt like if someone wanted a burger with M&C, a fried egg, and M&Ms... that they would try their best to make it happen.   I would say that Stuf isn't my favorite burger place... but it surely beats everyone's pants off on novelty and uniqueness! I think that is their niche anyways!  The speed of service seemed to be somewhere between fast food and a sit down restaurant. Which is good. The people working the counter came over and asked if we needed anything a few times too, which was also nice for that "blend" of fast food and a sit-down formal restaurant.  I will be back, and hopefully feeling a little bit better next time so I can better sample the offerings.

I'm not sure the hype here although admittedly I'm not a fish taco fanboy. The food was good, but I felt a bit expensive. If I want tacos I'd much rather go to Fuzzy's on Mill - bigger portions for less money. Nothing on the menu jumped out me here but I got the beer battered mahi tacos. Beans were awesome. GF got a vegetarian taco and wasn't impressed at all.  On a side note there was a guy there who I'd assume was the owner. While he didn't talk to me, he seemed like a dick.

Came on Saturday @ 10:30pm, nobody here. Like no patrons and no bartenders. Had to wait for bartender. Who waits for a bartender at an empty bar?  I am not sure if there are better nights to come but I was oddly surprised that there was literally nobody here at 10:30pm on Saturday.  With that said, if nobody is there then there isn't a need to blast the music. Sure I understand that you might turn it up to let people know you're open, but man... It was deafening. I had you literally lean over and scream at the top of my lungs (and even then I couldn't even hear myself!). I've been at plenty of bars/clubs where there were tons of people and the music was a fraction of the volume. I went outside and still, very loud. And I file this complaint with the notion that I love loud music!

I don't know what it is about clubs/bars... but they are so incredibly inept about getting bottle service!  So here's the scoop... I reserved a table a week and a half out for the girlfriend's birthday. First question, what package do you want? Got it. Second question, what time would you like to arrive? How about 9?   NOPE. Sorry, we don't start service until 10. OK, fine, 10pm then.  I get there at 9pm and say that I'm there and that I'll come back at 10pm to start service as agreed upon. I come back at 10pm and they use their walkies to say get table ready and to wait by front for host. No host... no host... no table... 30 minutes go by (I'm just conversing with my party keeping them occupied at front). I ask again, are they coming? Oh, yeah, call again... no host, no host... no table. Another 30 minutes roll by. So now it is 11:00pm. Finally I get pissed and ask where my damn table is at.  Oh, OK, here it is. I get seated at 11:15pm. Awesome, now I have 2 hours and 45 minutes to drink a 30 pack and a bottle instead of 5 hours as I wanted (9pm). Half my party has already drank on their own tab and doesn't want to drink the bottle service.  Awesome. Another little nugget of joy is that when I am patiently waiting I see that there is actually indeed bottle service at some of the tables. So why tell me 9 is not available?  Also, some bottle of champagne got added to the service despite nobody drinking the table items that were already there. Not sure if someone ordered it without me or if DB thought it'd be a nice gesture to give it to me and charge me anyways? (If DB just lets anyone in the party put a bottle of champagne on MY tab, that is interesting too).  The only two things that were positive were that while we were waiting over an hour for the table, they came and gave my entire party a free shot. Secondly, everyone enjoyed their time there. Despite these fun items the facts still remain... I got seated way late... I didn't get the package I ordered a week prior... and worst of all instead of the party enjoying a table on my dollar they had to buy their own drinks most of the night.  Bottom line is that bottle service is a premium service. And to me being seated hours after me desired time and over an hour after the agreed time is just unacceptable. Dierk's is a good party place... but I felt like I was just a cash-cow patron. So long as they got me my table SOMETIME during the night, they could charge me the full package price. I get the feeling that unless you are buddy-buddy with the owners/servers/bouncers and come every week and get bottle service that you are going to get yanked around. This is generally my experience in Scottsdale and now here at Dierks.  One last note is that if you're looking for a country bar - this isn't it. I'm not sure I heard much country at all.

Good food and service. This may be my new spot to come and watch games so I don't have to drive all the way to northern Chandler or Mesa to find a place that has my game on.
