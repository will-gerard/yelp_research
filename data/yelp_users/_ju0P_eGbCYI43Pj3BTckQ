It's okay. But better gyros are down the street at Z's Greek.

Been coming to Pino's for years. Pizzas are always good, Calzones are amazing, and I love their sandwiches for lunch. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

I love SideBar. Yeah the drinks are expensive, but I think you get what you pay for, a decent high end bar in downtown phoenix. Get the Whiskey Sour, fantastic!
