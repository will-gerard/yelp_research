The paneer tika masala & chicken 65 are amazing and the people that work here are wonderful! The first time we came in we were served promptly, and attended to. I love northern Indian food ie shahi paneer, mattar paneer. I asked them what was equivalent. Happy the manager suggested the tika masala. It was great! We have come back once a week ever since. Great customer service, great people, yummmmy food.

Food is great. It's a shame the service can't keep up. After waiting 40 minutes for an order of sashimi, we were told we wouldn't be getting it because they ran out of yellowtail. Why they didn't tell us that as soon as they noticed? Instead, we had to inquire twice. the first time about 25min in. When we were told, 'oh yes your order is next.' Then, we asked after another 10min. This time there was a huddled discussion between the manager and chef and we were told they had just run out. But when we saw them bring out more for other diners, I had to yelp about it. Even worse was the terrible "customer service" from the manager. Our server never showed up again. They put mayo on items we requested they didn't. All in all, the food was good when receive as ordered but it wasn't enough to make up for the inadequate service.
