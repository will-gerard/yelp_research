My wife and I came here after Christmas shopping. The service was not great. We had to ask multiple times for more drinks. On top of the bad service, the bar was blaring screamo music. The bar had a lot of off duty employees hanging out along with some normal customers. There didn't seem to be anyone in charge. We won't be back.

Great service, friendly staff, but no drive through. You can't have everything. I stop here every morning and have never had a bad experience.

I have been going to this location since they opened.  Unfortunately, over the past several months (perhaps a newer manager) this location has gone down hill.  I took my family last week and the place was filthy.  There was garbage from previous customers all over the floor.  We were there during a slow time and rather than sweeping the floor or wiping the tables, the girls at the front counter chatted with each other.  There were open booths yet none of them were cleaned.  I asked a worker (every person who works the front counter is a young female who seems to be more interested in their social life than customer service) to wipe down the table.  She went into the kitchen to get a rag.  When she started wiping the table, the stench from the filthy rag almost made me have to leave.  I could not believe she wiped my table with such a soiled rag without noticing the stench.  Unbelievable.  I will not go back until the manager decides to start managing the place.  If Barro's actually reads these reviews, I hope they find a manager that puts customers ahead of his desire to hire cute "help".

This is the best Starbucks in the valley. The staff is friendly and efficient and the out door deck is great! They did this one right.

I arrived around 10 minutes before noon to hopefully beat the lunch rush. I was the only one there. As I ate my lunch, 3 other customers arrived. There was no lunch rush. As far as the food...  ...Simply put, disappointed. I decided to go with the sliders, pork - chicken - beef.  The pulled pork was mushy and left a gritty paste in my mouth. The bread was dry and boring. The beef was fatty and over cooked. Rather than being cut into little pieces, the beef was one large slice on a tiny bun. The chicken was dry. I had to add additional sauce to ask the meats to make them edible.  I think this is one of those places that people go once and never return. At least that describes me.

This is a great Starbucks! The staff is very friendly and they have outdoor seating and a drive through. I have never received a beverage that wasn't made to my liking.

We were invited to the Handlebar by some friends.  My wife and I each had a burger and some beer.  The waiter was great, the service was amazing, and the burgers were very, very good.  The owner was walking around asking his customers how their experience was going.  He was kind and truly seemed interested in the feedback provided.  The patio is great and the inside has a lot of character.  We will be back for sure!
