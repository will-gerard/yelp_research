SOPAPILLAS!!! so so good!!!   Enchiladas were good.. chips were spicy and tasty! Loved the patio dining ambiance! It's a little further away from Old Town but worth it!

The best ny style pizza I've had outside of ny! You think of pizza delivery and you think of cold over or under cooked pizza that's either too cheesy and greasy or just too crusty and doughy.   The veggie pizza here was delicious and after two slices, all I wished for is that I had a larger stomach to fit in one more! The slices here are quite large btw!  They chop their veggies finely - don't know why it's so hard for others to do this - so every bite is perfectly balanced. I really don't like large chunks of veggies thrown on top. It also was not cheese overload - they used it for flavor but I didn't find myself tearing off chunks if unnecessary cheese from any part!   The pizza here was amazing! Amazing amazing! Highly recommend!

Honestly, I'm a gelato snob and any gelato that comes close to tasting like ice cream or had that ice texture rather than the creamy milky texture, I don't like!   And such was the case here - couldn't find any of the flavors that really tasted like gelato not ice cream!   The woman behind the counter is also exceptionally cold..  And this is the gelato place by the casino, not the one in St Mark's Sq..

First of all, this place is right on the canal (the only place to be so) and therefore that alone earns it several of its stars. I mean, when you have something as special and romantic as a Venice canal with gondolas passing by every 15mnts and gondoliers serenading their guests, why wouldn't you take full advantage of it!!   The place itself was very vegetarian-friendly, albeit relied heavily on mushrooms (which I'm allergic to). The only downside of this place was that they were unwilling to do any substitutions at all, which means for a mushroom-allergic person such as myself, there weren't really that many vegetarian options left. We tried the guac-chips and fondido as well as sides of beans and cilantro rice.

-- Lobby stinks of smoke and has no other attraction -- Housekeeping sucked because despite a DND sign, they kept knocking every 45mnts or so! -- Room service took forever -- Bathroom was not actually "Westin-big" and the shower tub was actually quite annoying because the stopper kept closing itself shut due to the force of the water.  -- Overall the place is old and shabby, not maintained too well  -- All in all, not a great deal, not a great place, and not recommended really.

The only one good meal I had in Vegas! Somehow, I'm also underwhelmed by the restaurants here but this was a pleasant surprise!   Every single dish we ordered was confirmed to be excellent! I had the risotto and I tried my friend's penne too..

Great Yelp discovery in Vegas.. the service was terrible because we kept being passed from one server to another and finally couldn't find anyone to request a check for 15mnts before we went up to the hostess.   The veggie burger was actually pretty good - it was homemade with mushroom, bread, rice and some other vegetables. We had it on the onion bun and liked our combo. Also, the veggie burger was only $9 (unlike some of the $22-24 burgers in some reviews here).   We did try the sweet potato fried and definitely lived up to its hype. We also indulged with a Nutella milkshake but with vanilla icecream (it comes with chocolate icecream otherwise) and liked it lots.   I'd say if in the area, try it out. Not something to make a trip for though.

I'm usually skeptical of Vegas strip restaurants but I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was over here. Thanks to all the Yelp review mentions of the French Onion Soup, of course had to try that. Their salad and other items were good too and just as everyone else has said, if you sit in the patio you can see the Bellagio fountains!

I loved the Nutella crepe here for being the perfect thickness, being perfectly delicious with just the right amount of Nutella, and being absolutely fresh and quick and tasty!   Agreed, $10 seems steep for a crepe, but trust me, these crepes are more than a full meal! I couldn't even finish just a dessert crepe on my own and it was my first meal of the day at 5pm!

What an intricate, creative and talented production! I can't believe people can do half the things they did as part of this show! I loved the acrobatics and just the unimaginable talent the cast demonstrated but also the art of perfection each of them have mastered.   I was personally a little distracted by the clowns, just not my thing, but the other stuff was cool! I totally recommend it as an experience that defines Vegas in a large part! I'm just not sure I'll turn into one of their biggest fans who will see every production and/or some multiple times.

All my friends said - one place you must visit in Vegas is Tryst. So I set out to enquire with my concierge and so glad I did because she helped put us on a ladies' guest list and we didn't spend 2 hours standing in line!   It was definitely a little disorganized and one of my friends quite had to hustle her way in despite us being on some 'list.' But hey, when we got it, the only one star I'll refrain from rewarding is for how many people they packed in here. The drinks/bar were decently accessible, because of it being open-air, ventilation was decent, music was awesome, waterfall was fun! Plenty of seating space (yeah, for bottle service, but still).   What I especially fell in love with was the front chambers of the lounge before entering the club! Plush velvet, odd-shaped mirrors, amazing sound system - the best part of the night was lounging and enjoying the music without having to get pushed around.

We had pretty good quesadilla here and the windows looked out to their Chinese Garden creation for the Chinese New Year, which was vibrant and charming.   Service was okay, place was huge, nicely located though!

I haven't seen too many Broadway musicals but between Cats, Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera, this wins hands down!  The sets are absolutely amazing and I couldn't believe how quickly they transform the stage with such precision and detail! The Phantom Theater in Vegas must have been built for this resident show because the balcony seats and the chandelier are all part of the production!   The cast did a fabulous job too!

It's a good location, the suites are a good size with great Strip views from the balcony. Service is really slow but all else was fine with our stay!

The ambiance, decor, seating, customer base are all very cool. You can work here with a laptop, have interesting conversations with people, or get together for drinks with personal or business friends!   The service was a little slow, but the cocktails, when they did finally come out, we're strong and tasty! Their happy hour runs from 4-8pm and cocktails for $7 was a good price! Their 2 for $5 munchies were pretty good - pretzels and honey sesame cashews are the 2 we tried!

Great service! We did the sunset ride over the Grand Canyon with them and from booking to billing and pickup to pre-flight to pilot, everything was done in a very friendly and warm way!  The ride itself was unique and a memorable experience. We flew over the Valley of Fire, the Las Vegas Lake and then the Canyon itself, where we landed for a cute picnic of champagne and cheese-crackers and took in the magnitude and gorgeousness of the Canyon, before flying over the Hoover Dam and finally over the strip (both old and new).   I recommend this helicopter company over the others that we researched for actually delivering on what they promised and making this trip once in a lifetime experience.

My best spa experience. Ever. Period.   Their steam and sauna were great. But really, it's their aromatherapy massage that I'm ga-ga over! Wish the masseuse would just move to Chicago!

The only one meal in Vegas worth Yelp'ing home about! (Although i did write reviews for all the others too).   I really enjoyed their pasta, interesting environment and decent service. But most importantly, a decent meal!!

Newer property and while not a fan of Sheratons in general, this was surprisingly well made. The check-in process was painful as the woman behind the counter didn't know anything about the SPG Platinum program and didn't want to listen, but everything else about the stay -- the room, check-out, bell desk, club lounge, bar in the lobby, location -- were convenient.

How disappointing! After hearing about the concept for so long, when I finally got a taste of the ice bar, I was super disappointed. It was expensive ($35 entry fee) and tiny inside - the size of my closet!   You go in, get a drink and come out. You don't even have ice bar stools or ice beer mugs! I would really suggest skipping this and spending the $$s elsewhere!

I generally don't enjoy packed crowded places with horrible attitudes. XS was a lot more streamlined, for every 1 rude/mean staff there were 2 others who were friendly and the sound system was great!   The outside area is super cool if they setup the DJ by the pool!

Casino review (not hotel/rooms) -- the dealers at this casino are some of the most uptight who won't indulge in conversation, won't even smile, in fact, we kept getting ID'ed even though we were much older which got really annoying..

WOW - this is one place that totally lived up to all of its hype and more! You walk in to be greeted by several people, in very welcoming and warm voices.   You take the elevator up to the Sky Lobby on the 23rd floor with beautiful views behind the front desk. Every single person here was so polite and even though we had a mix-up, they took care of it all on their own, while seating us in the bar (the only one part of Mandarin Oriental I wasn't impressed by).   The room was absolutely lovely - we had views of the strip - but more importantly, the intricacy of detail and the use of technology made this experience one of the best ever (and yes, I've traveled quite a bit). The bathroom was quite large (definitely one of the items on my checklist when evaluating a hotel-room) and everything was clean, tidy and not overcrowding.   It does, of course, have a very East Asian flavor to everything, from the decor to the colors (red) and the patterns. I found the brown-red colors soothing and most importantly, relaxing and rejuvenating after a day out in the noise and crowd (they don't have a casino here)!   I have reviewed their bar, spa and restaurant separately.

To see a moving and touching story, I'd recommend Phantom, but to see a beautiful creative gorgeous breath-taking mind-blowing production - sets, costumes, lighting, props - I'd highly recommend The Lion King!!

Breakfast at MOzen was a great experience! Their walnut-banana french toast was quite delicious and everything else, from their pastries to granola to waffles was good. The omelets are different in a good way!   Their beverages are a little pricey ($9 for most, including tea/coffee) but those are listed on the menu!   The service was very good and overall a positive experience!

Mandarin Oriental hotels are known to have great spas (in fact their hotel-spa in NYC is ranked as one of the best in the world) and this one lives up to that reputation.   However, my experience with this spa is limited as the exorbitant prices kept me away from trying too many of their services/facilities.   The concierge desk service was very helpful and polite - and accommodating. I had a $100 spa credit and was flying back that afternoon (on a Saturday). They did their best to fit me in somewhere and give me a taste of their spa treatments. The one I did was the 25mnt foot treatment.   The room overlooked the strip (from the 7th floor) and it was a beautiful view. The massage therapist was very sweet and knew when I wanted to chat and when I just wanted to close my eyes and relax. Their products were great (smell and feel).   The foot treatment itself didn't seem as great to me because it wasn't really a massage (more a cleansing/lotioning treatment). And it cost $90! Which I totally didn't think was worth it (even at a Mandarin Oriental Spa).   Finally, there was some lady at a not-so-nearby room talking way too loudly to be ignored, which broke my sense of serenity.   I do hear great things about their showers and water treatments and wish I had tried those instead! Just a fair warning on prices though - their couples massage costs anywhere from $450 to $800 and most other massage treatments start at the $250 price label.  P.S. Highly recommend booking a treatment days in advance as they do seem to be very busy!

Absolutely my best experience in Vegas ever! This dayclub is one of the most fun, creative, chill and amazing places I've hung out!   Beds inside the pool, couches by it, swings near by, overlooking a "beach" and then add in the drinks and the awesome music! I also want to say the crowd here is not your typical Vegas tourist, but I guess there is no "typical" Vegas tourist, but I digress - what I mean to say is the crowd here is fun and chill!   I would highly recommend and can't wait to be back myself!

I had only been to the poolside before, but went to the club for the first time! The bouncers were actually friendly, making sure there was enough space to walk around. The sound system here is amazing! Fun to see some great DJs!   Two floors to the nightclub - the one upstairs is a lot larger!

Beautiful property, elegant rooms, friendly service, privacy and relaxation! I'd recommend the Phoenician for food/pools rather than Canyon Suites. They also didn't offer late check out even as a Platinum guest. For St Regis prices, they didn't have butler service comparably..

The heated tent in the back is super cool! We had a nice server but being busy, their service was very slow! Water took ten minutes and food took another twenty.   I had the Pad Thai tofu and most places can't get this right. They make it too sweet or too cooked. This place prepared it just right! So yummy!!   I hope I get the chance to go back and try one of their curries too!

We were given free entry and free drinks until midnight - the club has a really weird vibe and audience. You can see the fountains from here but that's the only good part. designed to be almost exclusively for tables, there is no room to move or dance even at 11pm when people haven't even shown up yet. the drinks were also very weak.

We are visiting for a few days and heard the story of the owner of Eat - very inspirational!   Came here for lunch yesterday and cannot say enough good things about the vegetarian tofu banh mi sandwich and their iced tea. Everything tastes fresh and carefully prepared.   The wait was long for a large party of 6 but once seated, service was super friendly!
