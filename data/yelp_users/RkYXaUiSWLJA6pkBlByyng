Alan totally helped me out a couple weeks ago when I was in a rush to get a family photo framed. I found him thanks to yelpers stating how awesome he was- and they were 100% right. He was friendly, professional, does beautiful work and for a very reasonable price. I will never go anywhere else for my framing needs again. Thanks, Alan! :)

Giving one star because I have to and because the woman that was working on my nails was a very nice person. This was my third time visiting this academy in the past five years or so, and my past two experiences were okay. This on the other hand was a disaster from the beginning. I booked over the phone weeks in advance and was informed that I could have two people working on my manicure and pedicure at the same time so that I could be out of there in an hour and a half. When I arrived, they had made no such plans, and a half an hour into my manicure I informed her that I had been told I would have two people working on me. I also let her know I would have to be out in a total of an hour and a half, which even with it being a school setting- is sufficient. They brought someone over to start working on my pedicure and I was in an awkward twisting position (which left me with a bear of a backache) having to accommodate the set up. I had to inform my nail technician of a medical reality (that I typically do not need to disclose) once she gouged into my thumb while trimming skin and took a huge chunk out of it. I have had my nails done dozens of times since I have had this medical situation, but typically I am not torn apart during the procedure so I do not need to disclose it. After that, she was too afraid to do any trimming and my cuticles looked awful. She also seemed to struggle to see the polish job she was doing and there were bubbles and streaks galore. Then when we finally got to my toes, she polished those in a manner that was literally less skillful then when I allowed my eight-year-old niece to do my toes. So, 20 some dollars & two HOURS later I ended up walking out with my nails and hands looking worse than they did when I arrived. This is the day before leaving on a vacation so I could not allow them to remedy the situation until I was back in town a week and a half later. I called the manager from San Francisco the next day because my toes looked like they had been polished by a three-year-old, and the manicure polish was literally falling off my hands. I was not digging in the fields or doing anything that would damage them, and less than 24 hours later there was less than 50% polish on my hands. I had to get both my Mani/pedi redone first day of my trip. I'm not even kidding, it was FALLING off. I explained all this to her that from booking to the end of service it was an inexcusable waste of money and time, and she had no interest whatsoever in making the situation right. I understand this business is a school, but they are also charging customers to come there, even if it is cheaper, and if somebody has a horrible experience they need to do something as a business to remedy the situation. Like I said, this manager I spoke to  over the phone had no interest in doing that and I recommend you take your time, money and nails elsewhere and spend a little bit extra to go to a place where they know what they're doing and aren't going to have you leave their establishment looking worse than when you came in.

I started going here years ago thinking I would avoid being ripped off at the dealership, and Jack (the head mechanic) seemed nice. Well, I was wrong, they are as full of it as the dealerships! Jack was insisting I needed fluid changes that were in the $300-500 range on a 3 year old vehicle with less than 30,000 miles. He came up with an impressive list of what I needed to have done. I expressed to him that if it wasn't necessary, I'd prefer not to due to financial strain at the time. He insisted still that it was mandatory and needed to happen ASAP. So I found a mechanic in Tempe highly recommended on Yelp, and he did one of the services for half the price Jack quoted. The mechanic did the service and then stated it wasn't even necessary, and had he known, he wouldn't have had his guys do it in the first place. I told him about the rest of Jack's list and he stated that NONE of the things were necessary on a new car of my make and model with the low mileage I maintain. I was furious to say the least. Turns out Jack's another wolf in sheep's clothing...and it makes me particularly angry because after 3 years of regular oil changes and asking me for a ton of money, Jack never could manage to remember my name or my car. Horrible customer service. I highly recommend Gene's Auto Worx in Tempe...he's HONEST, straightforward, and doesn't take advantage of women who aren't knowledgeable of what a car does and does not need at certain points in the car's lifetime. I have a lot of interests, that is not included....I need someone I can trust. Go see Gene.

So after writing a very accurate review on Yelp about my experience with this business, I was faced with calls from the owner in which:  1) He admitted that Gene's costs are 15-20% lower than his costs 2) Invalidated my experience and tried to make me out to be a liar- unsuccessfully. Jack did tell me the work needed to be done, and that if I couldn't do the full $400+ work he was recommending right away, I at least had to have the brake fluid done immediately- which Gene informed me was not true on my first visit. None of it was necessary. 3) He then called my new mechanic and bothered him about this situation....only to find out that Gene still stands by exactly what he has always stated (that the work was not necessary), and the software that Gene uses does not agree with what they use at this shop. 4) There was then a voicemail, which I have saved, from the owner of Bridwell trying to bribe me with $100 cash to meet him at my new mechanic's shop to try and prove something about the fluids.....though the review I wrote was in regards to why I stopped going to Bridwell over a year ago, thus making it a desperate and invalid attempt to remedy the review I wrote.   So what if Gene's shop is in Tempe in an industirial area and not in the heart of Scottsdale. Seriously? Are you kidding me? Who cares!  I'm not moving in! Maybe Bridwell's location has something to do with the pricing issues they have...figure they can get away with it in that neighborhood. Gene has 38 shining reviews on Yelp, (with the exception of 1 disgruntled reviewer), and 3 out of 8 reviews for Bridwell state they ask for unnecessary repairs that are over-priced even if they are necessary. So you be the judge.   And if you do leave a not so positive and honest review to assist your fellow Yelpers in finding good service- I hope you have a good code name on here, because this owner will look you up and you will be called and bothered in his attempts to invalidate everything you have said...even if he doesn't have all the facts.

I found Gene through Yelp after getting fed up with the rip off nightmare I was dealing with in Scottsdale with another mechanic. Gene and his team are professional, friendly, will not give you unnecessary quotes for unnecessary services, and will give you a reasonable price for the services your car does require. Don't hesitate, go see these guys. AND, as a woman who needs a mechanic she can trust (I am in my mid 30's and don't even know how to check the oil on a car, and the only time I've ever opened the hood of a car was when I accidentally pulled the lever when looking for the gas tank door release)...I need someone who is honest that I know won't take advantage of my admitted automotive ignorance- that's Gene.

I would love to give a better review because the burgers & fries are ok, but literally EVERY time I have been there they have messed up the order....every. single. time. Including tonight....nothing complicated on the order, but specifying "no cheese" on one of the 3 burgers & what did we get? 3 burgers with cheese. And they are always cold...I do not have to drive far to get home from Habit, and it's not that they are no longer hot...they are cold. Needless to say, I'm done. This place isn't worth it at all.

This place USED to be great. But within the past year they fired all the amazing awesome staff that was here, and now it is a grim energy in the store....and what used to be an enthusiastic, energetic, knowledgable staff is now a staff that makes you feel like you are annoying them by showing up to shop there. Tried to give the benefit of the doubt and go a few times...but this place is officially never getting my business again. Found the same Acana food online, delivered to my house for CHEAPER than this store was charging. Go elsewhere.

To be honest, I am seriously surprised anyone can give less than five stars when describing their experience at Ten. I can't help but wonder what could've possibly been so different from all of my experiences there, or what personal psychological  issues they have that they need to nitpick every little detail. I have been multiple times with family and friends who all describe this as one of their absolute favorite restaurants in town. From my very first visit, the service, food, and drinks have been flawless. The owner consistently has a presence in the restaurant, doing everything from greeting guests, delivering food, to busing tables. The energy, decor, staff, and most importantly food and beverage are phenomenal. This pot roast is life-changing. The old-fashioned and other cocktails are so well crafted...you can't go wrong with any choice. Take it from a foodie who loves to dine in Chicago, San Francisco, New York City, and here locally at all our great restaurants, this place is so worth it! Go! :)
