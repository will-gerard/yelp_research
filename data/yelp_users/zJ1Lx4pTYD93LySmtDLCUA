I came in for an early dinner. I ended up ordering the salad spaghetti meatballs. They also served me homemade bread is absolutely delicious The staff is super friendly and I got to meet the manager as well. I would deathly recommend come here even for lunch specials. I will deftly be coming back within the next month to have some of their delicious bread. Thanks again!

Nice staff and a great vibe to the store. Ordered the breakfast burrito and the berry blast shake with peach! It was great and I ended up play chess with my friend while waiting for the food.  This is a great post hike spot for food and a cool down. I highly recommend for an alternate to LGO!

I was always a fan of the HNJ chain in California, but tonight was just not their night to be representing their chain.  Tonight was my brother's 24th birthday and I already called in advance that a group was coming in to dine in. Our waiter, who I will hold the name from this review, took our orders, served us water, and left his shift giving it to another young man who took over the table. Granted, I knew it was about 70 mins from Last Call and we were a big group, you would assume attention to detail is most important.  First we order appetizers, which were mediocre at best (the calamari breading was too salty and saturated from the deep fryer oil). Next, the orders of clams came out and within the first two clams I ate, I felt like I almost split my teeth because I bite gritty sediment in my food. Seafood should've been washed properly and rid of the rocks and grits of the clam. I had to send it back. By now, my appetite has faded because of the quality of the food I expected from such a reputable chain. As everyone one around me got their food, multiple bus boys/girls brought food out to the table. Unknowingly more people came to join our party, the late comers who ordered food after my brother and I received their food first. Granted, most of us ordered similar dishes, it should have been the staff's responsibility to figure out who's food went to who. I ended up not getting my 2lbs of shrimp with potatoes and corn, sending back a pound of clams, and not even enjoying my appetizer.  When the checks came back, none of the orders were organized in the way we set it with the first waiter to left serving us. I almost feel bad, which is why I'm donating a half star to the review, for the new waiter because he got bombarded with complaints from our table. Beers from one side of the table were charged to the other side of the table's tab, and one of my friends ended up paying $95 when he barely at half a bag of shrimp. It is just ridiculous, and what made it worse is that it was closing time, so pressure to get up and leave was felt. I've worked in the restaurant business and I know how staff get when the last few customers don't leave.  The only reason why I'm donating another half star to give this review of Tempe's Hot & Juicy a whopping 1 star review, is because he gave us a free pound of shrimp 'on the house' from the kitchen. I honestly don't know what is wrong with this chain but from what I remember at my experience in Cali's HNJ, it was a night and day. I'm leaving this review still upset and disappointed at the professionalism of the staff and food quality tonight.
