Great place to grab a drank and get some munchies! Friendly staff and a decent environment! Their ghost pepper sauce is actually hot.

Went in today to have some dinner with my girlfriend as we had a coupon (never been here before). The waitstaff was very friendly, the food was decent and the atmosphere was pleasant!   The songo (bingo with songs played) was pretty cool, too. I'm sure we will be back.

Great little hangout on Wednesday nights to play trivia! The hosts are amazing and keep it fun!   Takes a little longer than Normal for service, but still a great place to have fun.

Haven't been to this bar in a few years, but when Wayne is behind the bar it's always a good experience. He's well over 40 and has more energy than most 20 year old bartenders.   Wayne is the type of man who gives respect when it's given. He may come off as rude but that's just how he talks lol.   Anyways, I had the nachos (half) and they were awesome!   Thanks again.

This place is terrible. Slow service, slow food and cold chicken. We've been here a couple times before and never had this much of a problem. I even asked for salt and pepper and never got it. Wow

Been coming here for at least 8 years now.   A friend and I started the little "car show" about 4 years ago, got them a lot of business!  I always get their carne asada burritos with no pico and rice/beans on the side.   They don't screw up my order and I've never gotten sick eating there.

I have been here twice now.   I must say this place is pretty good! I've always done take out for lunch (carne asada burrito) and my co worker gets the carne tacos (which she says is bomb) lol.   The cashier is always friendly and the business seems to always have customers. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area looking for some Mexican food!

Just stopped in to check out some gas cans from a dude named Tyler, I had such a positive customer experience I purchased some matte black gas cans with the assistance of CJ because I had to get prescription lenses.  Both of them were VERY friendly, professional and had a very high knowledge of every product I inquired about.   Please give my kudos to both of them!

Been coming to this place for about 3 years now. We love to sit at the "presidential table" haha. The food is always good and the service is always with a smile.   It can be a little slow on the lunch rush but that's to be expected.   All in all this is a great Mexican food restaurant in central Phoenix!

Never a bad time here, it's cheap and fun. The R.O.s are a little strict but that's to be expected with all the new people to shooting.

I love pei Wei, never a long wait at this location, food is always good and everyone is always friendly.   Not a huge fan of their sushi but that's because they're not a sushi place. But it's still not bad.

Been here about 10 times to play poker, it's a decent bar for the area.   This place is ALWAYS busy so getting a beer might take some time, the crowd is mixed ect.

I have been coming here for years! The service is always great and with a smile. I typically only get their bento as it is delicious. Haven't ventured off much from there but I feel the need as it has everything.

I always get my free air check here. Never have I ran into a serviceman who didn't have a friendly attitude or treated me wrong.   Always fast and professional service, they always offer a bottle of water when it's hot which is nice!   Keep up the good work guys!

Got a hair in our crab puffs, a big disgusting hair. They didn't do anything but take that part off of the bill. Not sure if there were anymore hairs.

This place is terrible. I went to grab a beer (at the bar) and I'm listening to the good music on the juke box and I hear Mexican music in the kitchen VERY loud.   The food is sub par and the service is good at best. Jim and Laura do a great job but I can't speak for anyone else.   The owner wants to turn this bar into a shit biker bar (which is fine) but they won't get my business for much longer, I will just bring a flask.   Take ownership or have fun trying to save this sinking ship.   The bathroom always smells and looks terrible, my sisters husband fixed it one night and didn't even get paid. Let that sink in.

I will start by saying that this place is Hands down best sushi in Arizona.   I've been coming here for about a year now and haven't been to any other sushi place since (except RA, for a birthday party) which was more expensive, loud and lower quality.   This is a family run establishment and a very nice, personal environment. You will never have a bad experience here, they aren't the quickest in town because they pride themselves with quality food and service.   Again, I will never eat anywhere else.

Wow.   This place is AMAZING! Their quality was way better than expected and the turn around time really surprised me.   It seems to be a great, family run business with the customers needs in mind.   If you need large print media, banners ect. I would highly recommend these guys!

No matter where I move, I always come here. Great atmosphere and even better cut.  I usually go with my man, Mike, but everyone else there is great as well! They cut kids hair as well.

Place wasn't very great. We had to wait at least ten minutes before we got service and the people who came in 5 minutes after us got served first. My corn on the cob was cold twice and the chicken tenders weren't that great either.

Place sucks.   I had a terrible experience, they were very rude and didn't get anything done so I will just go to the regular dmv.

Can't go wrong with jimmy johns. Their food is always good but their delivery service is hit or miss which is why I'm not giving them 5 stars.

Pretty good little hipster joint.   I had the chicken sandwich and it was delicious. I did take out for lunch as I work down the street.   I would recommend this to anyone looking for a specialty sandwich!   The place is rather small and I'm not sure how busy it gets.
