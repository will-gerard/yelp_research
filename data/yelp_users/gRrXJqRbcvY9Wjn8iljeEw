ALL OTHER SCOOTER SHOPS TAKE NOTE- this is what a real scooter shop should be like! Really nice guys. Good prices. Gave me a loner tire/wheel until Wednesday (since they can't get me a new tire for a couple of days) SO GREAT. I love the Urban Commuter! I'd give them a million stars if I could!

My parents raved about this place to me.. Couldn't say enough about the amazing food and service. Sadly, this was not the case 2nd time around. Consistency is key, but it seems like this something they lack. Waitress seemed rude and impatient and when she let us know that they were completely out of all beef products, she was unwilling to substitute other meat for us. Also, let me note that it was 6 pm when they ran out of beef... At a BBQ restaurant. When we were a little confused by the whole situation the waitress seemed to get more rude, like it was our problem. I will never eat here again and won't ever mention it to another person. Good luck with your current staff and business model, it seems to be working great for you (sarcasm)
