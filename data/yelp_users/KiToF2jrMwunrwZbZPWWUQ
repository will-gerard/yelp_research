This is one of the best BBQ spots the west has to offer. They now serve sweet potato fries as a side entree! I always Order the two meats: brisket and pulled pork! Bomb food and great staff!!!!

I love to come here! I come here at least twice a month. The food is great along with the staff. My usual is the "Baby Ray." 3 pieces of juicy fried chicken smothered in gravy and onions with 2 waffles. Everything tastes homemade and on point! This is one of my favorite spots for lunch!

This is one of my fave spots close to home. If you haven't been here before, their staff has samples of items on their menu for first timers. I always order a 2 item combo: Jen Red Pork & Chinese BBQ Pork with Pork Fried Rice. It's like heaven in my mouth. My girlfriend and I come here at least once a week. Also if you come here don't forget to make room for the cookie!

My co-workers always talk about this place so I figured to give it a try with a group of friends. I ordered the 1/2 meat lovers skillet with blueberry protein pancakes....it was BOMB! The sweetness of cinnamon and blueberries just went so together with the syrup. The skillet itself was phenomenal. My girlfriend loved her eggs Benedict. I think I just found my Sunday breakfast joint!

This is my first time ever trying Vietnamese food. I was really surprised of the portions and how fast the food came out. My friends made a few suggestions. I went with #5 (pork & shrimp spring rolls). The spring rolls came with peanut sauce that was so good! My main entree was #50 (grilled meat & egg roll). Basically a noodle salad with vegetables meat with an egg roll. It came with a sauce that I poured all over. Mixed it up and it was AWESOME! I am definately coming back!!!!

As I am writing this review I have yet to see my food. We have been given complimentary chips & salsa. However, I have seen 2 other tables get their food before me. This is terrible service...please beware of this chili's as you will wait for food for it to be warm.

This place has now become one of my favorite lunch spots. Awesome sandwiches! The pastrami with everything is my usual!

My girlfriend and I found this place on yelp. We've been coming back ever since. She usually gets the country fried burger and i always try their burgers that are on special. Food is always on point and the service great. If you are looking for a laid back joint with great food, Paradise Valley Burger Co. is the joint to be at!

This is my 1st time at this location & I have  to say my experience has been far better than the desert sky location! Our waitress Shelly Mac is the best!!!! She made sure to check on us on top of bringing those sweet rolls to our table. Our food came out really quick and was delicious. We will be coming back to this location for sure!

I come here once a week and the sushi is bombastic! The sushi comes on a conveyor belt and you can choose the type of sushi you want and don't have to wait for it. It's a fun atmosphere with great food.
