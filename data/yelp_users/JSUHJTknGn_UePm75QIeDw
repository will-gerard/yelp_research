Good spot to get a coffee,  but the attitude of some of the baristas need to remember that they are there to make coffee. My friend and I were both told what we wanted would take awhile instead of saying it will be longer than usual,  it's like they dreaded the thought of brewing coffee....aye

Get gas, coffee snack just about everything you could ask for. I'm surprised they are not selling clothing yet. That will probably be next year.   It is what it is.  There's only so much you can  write in a review.

I am surprised this place has not had a good review.  The gentleman who cut my hair did such an awesome job. I've been working in yet his area for a while and have went 3 different barbers before finding this place. Great attention to detail and quick as well.  I saw there was a bad review back in 2010...whatever,  this is a highly recommended place.

Excellent hamburgers and sandwiches and of course wings. Every time I've been here I have not been disappointed.  I tried the fried pickle burger which was delicious.  They were not to packed so we received our food fairly quick.  This is close to work si I will be returning again.

It's been awhile since I've been here and I was really looking forward to the create a pasta since it's been awhile.  Apparently they don't have it anymore.  The quality wasn't what I expected. The service was alright,  just not sure if I would return again.

Not the greatest selection,  I was charged over 10 dollars when the reviews I read stated it was under that.  The service was nice but not worth coming back. They should have a bigger soup selection. Also on the taco meat don't add so much cumin...that was brutal.

The crew here is always helpful and are willing to look into things to help you figure out the problem.  It's by the house been coming here for years.  They don't know everything but they will try and get you in the right direction.

This is our second time getting take out and we have not been disappointed.  A lot of food,  good flavor. This is one of those places that you know that they care what they t serve you. When they see you they make sure your taken care of.

Poor customer service walked in there has to get my daughters hair cut right away they said it be 45 minutes.  No one was in there. I understand appointments but learn customer service and try saying hello.

Best sushi on this side of the valley. Awesome staff that took really good care of me and my wife. We had the spicy garlic edamame also the ninja avocado I highly recommend this.  I also ordered one of the combination plates my wife got the yuki roll. So good, family owned and they know what they are doing.   Also they offer fresh wasabi, once you try you won't be satisfied getting what is served every where else.

It's nice that this place is open 24hrs. Just picked up some more coffee. Something about a nice cup of coffee just makes perfect sense.  This place was packed leave to do it yourself registers open and it would make life easier.

This visit was very unusual,  they were bust for a Friday but our server must have had way too many tables. I had to ask hostess for crayons and paper for my girls.   Hamburgers were good but the waitress was nowhere to be found when my daughter wanted more mac and cheese.  I asked one gentleman for the bill and he was very polite and asked 8 everything was good.   The restaurant industry is what it is and customers matter. If you want them to come back treat like you do.

Good place to get some good street tacos, not a lot of tables, and my favorite the shrimp cocktail. We will be back for sure.

It was nice to hang outside by the fountain as the summer begins to reveal itself.  My daughter had a great time playing. Not as much seating but if come prepared you can make it work.

Really bad service, crappy food that takes forever to get to your table, bathrooms were disgusting.  You have to get your own napkins and ask for silverware.

Good food, descent service.  It wasn't that packed I just had to ask for the silverware,   which is just always kind of Wierd....but what do you do.this ones a nice location.  One thing that is a definite side dish to order is the cauliflower fried dish with tahini. .just good.

This place rocks especially the donuts. The service is excellent,  atmosphere is what a donut shop should be. I will definitely be returning to get donuts in the future.

I eat a lot of Italian foods and Babbo knocks IT out of the park! The server did a great job. Highly recommend the pesto bruschetta. Chris the manager was very welcoming and you could tell he wanted all of his customers to receive excellent service.  We will be returning again most definitely!

2 stars because the wings were delicious,  I am really surprised that service has gone down in most places. I'm not sure if it's because they see a family and choose not to check how we are and think we won't tip. Which I did leave over 20% tip. It's just poor service brings good food down.

Very delicious, and excellent price. I have been to this place a few times now and have not been disappointed.  I had the Mi quant which was very good. This place is popular at lunch and the 1 server was running around and he did a great job.

Horrible service cold food. I had to ask for more water and the guy just gave me a heads up and then he finally brought me  some water 5 min later. I asked him if he saw me he just ignored me, I asked him and two other people to speak to a manager, the hostess said the manager was on vacation. They had to lower their prices because the quality got so bad, and now their service matches the food. Not recommended at all

Just got take out.....Awesome! !!! If you have not tried Vietnamese food, try this place. The inside is very clean and the service is great. They accidentally gave me 2 large soups but said not to worry they did not charge for it. Highly recommended

All I have to say is the store director Michael knows how to make sure any mistakes are resolved and taken care of. Michael went out of his way to make sure our daughter received the correct cake and even had his team go out of their way to deliver it. Highly recommended place to order cakes for birthday parties.

Good smoothies, came in today and only 1 guy working 2 customers.  I'm not sure management has a game plan on keeping customers but when you walk in and that is the situation at least let the customer know you will be with them. Everybody gets busy,  make it a place people fell comfortable entering.
