Loved the salesman we worked with, I can't remember his name unfortunately, but he was very low pressure and happy to show us around to look at 20 RV's and decide what we were most interested in. We went to all the lots in Mesa and this one seemed to have the best selection and prices.

Tamara Starks in the last week When I started my barber shop, a lady came and sold me on their credit card services. It was similar to a square reader that you attached into a phone. This was acceptable at the start of my business, but as I grew, I needed a better service. Their fees were also about 3%, which is not competitive, I had not done my research when I joined with them. I specifcally asked the saleslady if there was any specified length of time we had to use their services. The saleslady assured me there was not. I did see in my contract that they have a $495 early termination fee, and I asked what that meant, and the lady said that referred to other services, not credit card processing. So I assumed when I switched to a more professional company that offered the rates and products that I needed, there would be no issue with changing services. So I called to cancel my contract, as it cost $50 a month. Kassie was horrible! She demanded the $495 to cancel the contract. To be in a contract when you are given a square reader is ridiculous. That is a $10 product. I told her what the sales lady had told me, and in fact the sales lady agreed that she had said it when we were part of a three way call, and Kassie Chappell's reply was that it didn't matter what the sales lady had said, I should have read the contract. I didn't want to part with the $500, so they continued to withdraw $50 from my account every month even though I was no longer using their services. Last month I closed my bank account, so they were no longer getting the $50, so the horrible Kassie has sent me to collections. Nowhere in my contract it does it specify how long of a contract I was in. I have asked for proof of what timeframe I signed up for, and received nothing that I signed agreeing that I was in a contract for any stated length on time, only the paper with the early termination fee.

For my purpose, quick tasty sushi at a great price, this place is perfect. Service is fine. It's not somewhere I would take people to impress them with the ambiance, which is nice if not upscale, but I come here after work all the time when I can hit happy hour which is mon-fri 3-6 and 8-close.

I love this place, it's awesome to be able to get a decent price for your old books and video games, and then be able to go get other peoples old books and videogames also for a decent price!

This is my families FAVORITE place! We live in Gilbert, but still drive out here all the time because we love the food, and the servers. Our family of 7 can get out for under $25 if we don't get drinks and order everything ala carte. The price isn't what keeps us coming back though, it's the terrific food (and chips and salsa, i'm very picky, and it's perfect!)

The food came out scorching hot, which matters to me a lot! The fried orange chicken never got soggy, and the flavored of both the sesame and orange chicken were great! Loved it!

This drive-in holds a special place in my heart! This is my families favorite place to go on the weekend, my husband who is a Disneyland maniac says he likes it he likes  it more than Disneyland. We've made a lot of family memories here, it's super cheap and it makes for an awesome night out. The kids can run around, and nobody gets upset. Bring your own food, your own drinks, and your own chairs if you don't want to stay in the car. If you have an FM boombox or radio or tuner bring that for even better sound.

Probably the best luxury car service in Arizona. We have used AET to take us to the airport, to and from skiing up north, and to and from concerts on numerous occasions. Always great service and every driver has always been extremely accommodating

Not spectacular, but not bad. Quick easy and the salsa is great! The food is nothing to write home about, but if you are a chips and salsa fan this place will keep you coming back.

we were staying at Caesars Palace and wanted to try a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, so naturally we came here for dinner. The atmosphere is lovely. our server was wonderful, but the best part was when the manager, Randy, came and talked to us for about 15 minutes and told us fun Gordon Ramsey tidbits (my husband is a superfan) thanks for making it such a great expierence! of course the food was awesome as well!

Love this place! During the summer there is this awesome deal from 10-4 and for $23 it's all you can play bowling, lasertag, laser maze and the jumping castle. We have gone every Monday and had a blast! At one point the laser tag was shut down for an hour for photos and the manager went above and beyond to take care of us, thanks again!!!

This is a cool scrubs store. As far as selection goes there's a lot of different kinds of scrubs there, but finding that a matching set in your size can be a bit of a chore. But it's nice to be able to go in, and look at the different scrubs, feel the textures, and get a feel for what set you want to buy. The lady behind the counter was very helpful, and offered to order any scrubs online of which they didn't have in my size. I am a medium, so I would not have thought my size would have been that difficult to find, but I was very impressed with the many different brands and styles they carried. They have a lot of accessories as well if you're into that sort of thing.

I want to say thank you to best experience we have ever had from a complete stranger, tonight we went out to celebrate my husband being declared cancer free as well as the house we have been in escrow with for 3 months closing. We sold our last house that we had raised our children in when my husband was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, and we have been living like nomads waiting for our new home to close. Earlier we found out that Albert had been declared cancer free from on his last PET scan, and our home finally closed today. We went to Texas Roadhouse on Pebble Creek in Buckeye and when Lisa our server asked if we were celebrating anything I told her about our everything we were celebrating, she was so kind, she opened up about her own recent struggles with cancer.   During dinner she asked if Albert would go ride the bull, which he did with a bit of prodding, they announced he was riding the bull in celebration of being cancer free, I bawled the entire time. After the ride Lisa came back over and told us that one of the servers was covering our meal. She refused to even take a tip from us. This is the best place ever, they made this special night so much more so!

Mainly writing this review for the owners of the shop, I am a nurse and usually buy my scrubs here, and I also own a barbershop that we always buy our uniform tops from here, and the owner/manager has always been super helpful and been able to order the supplies we needed, I was super annoyed today, when I walked in the girl behind the counter was giggling on the phone and said she needed to get off because there was a customer, and when I asked about an embroidery shop to get the top I ordered embroidered, she said she didn't know what happened to the one that had been here. I asked if she could recommend anyone and she said she only worried about what was happening in her shop. Totally different than the very helpful other people I have worked with. She acted like I was crazy to think that she would be able to give me such a simple answer ( embroidery and uniforms go hand in hand) anyways I'm leaving it at 5 stars because most of the people who work here are great, the selection is good, and so are the prices.
