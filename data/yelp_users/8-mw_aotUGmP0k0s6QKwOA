Ah, The Old Spaghetti Factory. We first met in Tacoma whilst I played tourist almost 20 years ago. I've since bumped into you in Spokane, Denver and here in the homeland. For a chain, consistently good food for a good price. Salad and ice cream dessert included!

Thanks to Yelp for the invite! The date night was a double-date for us. The night left a lot to be desired, (wine, in particular!) but the facility is amazing regardless of your age. Who doesn't like to sit back and star-gaze? The Van Gogh exhibit was unlike anything I had ever seen before.  I will have to go back and get in touch with my inner child.

I would say they have earned my business for life, but it doesn't feel like business when you're treated like a friend. The ambiance, charm and quirkiness of this place makes one feel right at home. Delicious deli items, an eclectic wine offering and top-notch service make this place my new favorite Valley staple. Great for events! Keep them in mind for your baby shower/bar mitzvah/engagement party etc.

My favorite of all the Postino locations. The service is always top-notch and the patio makes it possible to believe you're not in the desert. My only suggestion for improvement: make that amazing Roasted Red Pepper Gouda soup a daily offering. Truly the best soup ever.

The first time I visited Liberty Market, I stood in line for 15 minutes until my self-diagnosed adult ADHD kicked in and I had to leave without ordering. I bookmarked it in my mind, though, as they had Tobin James on their wine list and the brick oven kicked just enough warmth to trigger nostalgia of childhood winter time. Anywho... I returned a year later and was not disappointed! The line was long, but moved fast! And, they save ya a seat while you're placing your order and settling the tab. This is now a place we visit every week or two.   My go-to sandwich order is the Cubano, of course. The side choices are homemade and the sweet potato salad is a favorite. Their "Best Chicken" is up there, too. Their Italian Wedding Soup, which was a weekly special, was the best I'd had. If you have room for dessert, I recommend the carrot cake.   This is also a sweet spot for coffee, but that's not what they're known for.

I always have a Soup Nazi moment here. Once I ordered a 'Navajo Taco' and not an 'Indian Taco' -- a mistake I will not make again. They are hardcore, but pretty much some of the best food you'll find in Arizona. Every time I sit down to my Indian Taco, I think...this should be the official food of Arizona.

Lured by the Phoenix Magazine claim that Abacus Inn boasts the Best General Tso's Chicken, it was worth investigating. The restaurant is traditional, service is kind and fast and prices are low. Best General Tso's Chicken? It's no match to the now defunct Jasmine Tea House in my hometown... but it's less sweet, red and sticky that what you find everywhere else. That, in my opinion, is a good start.

This is a great local business with a very knowledgeable staff.

I like this exercise venue so much more than the place that used to collect my fat tax (a.k.a. membership fees). I'm slightly younger than average member, but I find that as a bonus inspiration. If the lady next to me can keep pace on the treadmill while sharing tales about the grandkids, I can power through the lingering remnants of those occasional college cigarettes and inactivity. The RMC is not open on Sundays, which supports my ideas of having a day off, or a cheat day. Good for classes, nice equipment and a rock climbing wall to boot. Can't beat it for the price.

McCarran Intl Airport has become a cluster--too crowded, always 'renovating' but that's really code for more slot machines and less food options. Glad my plane wasn't more than 15 minutes late or I would have starved to death...or lost my mortgage payment hoping for one more spin on Wheel of Fortune. Great people watching but no compliment to the Vegas clientele.

Two different friends from two different circles pointed me toward Golden Buddha at COFCO Center. I was not disappointed. My eternal quest for the best General Tso's Chicken has not been satisfied since the Jasmine Tea House in Globe, Arizona closed...but Golden Buddha is the best Tso's I've found in Phoenix so far.  The venue exudes a cultural ambiance that is far superior to the stereotypical zodiac placemat. There is even live piano entertainment in the dinner hour. Friendly and knowledgeable staff also a perk!

This is the best spot for a luxury dining experience in the valley.

Chef Massimo has vision and charisma that only improves upon the timeless classics.

Not my favorite movie-going experience. The box office clerk had opinions about our movie choice and the popcorn was old -- even on a Saturday night. They do honor a refill in Harkins cups, but their lids don't fit, so I hope that stream of Cherry Coke matches your top. The worst part was sharing an auditorium with "AJ people" who waive the redneck flag proudly and yell their own commentary at the screen throughout the film.

I'm a sucker for ahi sashimi and this salad had some homemade pickles that were just out of this world. I didn't miss the fact that there was no dressing on the salad. Almond Olive Oil Cake made me curious, and while it was tasty, I will be getting the Lemon Tart next time!

Decent burgers and sides with high-quality ingredients. The Turkey Sloppy Joe changed my mind about 1) turkey burgers and 2) sloppy joes. Service is good, usually, too. I recommend their sangria, but if you're celebrating anything, split a milkshake or cream pie.

Ever have an experience so poor you think you're being punk'd? This was more of a museum than a restaurant...a wonderful place to watch other people eat while all the components of your brunch for a party of four arrive one at a time over an hour and a half. It felt like a puzzle we had to piece together before our fourth member could even receive their meal.  With the exception of a slow but very apologetic waiter, the staff was an embarrassment to the service industry. Some advice: 1) do not argue with your customers 2) do not say food is coming out late because the bar and the patio are packed -- since when is being seated inside the actual restaurant a punishment? Also, between the dining room, the bar and the patio there were about eight tables. 3) do not serve soggy, day-old sourdough as a 'brioche'   I will only go back to this spot in six months -- when it has crumbled under its own pretentiousness and mismanagement and a new venue has sprung forward.

Fastest Emergency Room ever. Not even signed in and the patient I escorted was being called back. Within 2 hours, all tests were done and we had a diagnosis.

Torched Goodness is a special treat! I have seen them twice at the Wigwam Farmers Market. Creme brulee is my favorite dessert and they do it right!

Love this place! A must stop for anyone downtown needing a snack or a drink! Very good happy hour and unbelievable flavor combinations. On my last visit, I was pleased to try some happy hour toasts and fish and chips. Zero disappointment.

I love FilmBar! Mr. & I discovered during their Frightmare series in October and saw a number of GREAT old horror movies. We enjoyed said films in a cozy, bohemian setting while sipping good local brews and eating popcorn. Staff is great, too.

I like to think I'm a good local, but I never knew of this place until the Travelzoo offer came. A wonderful brunch spot right in downtown Phoenix (inside Westin Hotel). The decor is lovely and the service is on point, but the menu is also quite interesting. My favorite part is that they brew Intelligentsia Coffee (a Chicago favorite). One criticism: if the menu states 'roasted red peppers' I do not expect yellow, which are not as tasty. Overall, great experience I will repeat.

I'm certain there is an urban dairy farm on the back end of this joint...this is the most well-balanced, freshest-tasting ice cream I've ever had. The flavors are just unique enough to stand out among artisan menus but classic enough to pull on your cravings. Vietnamese Coffee, for instance. Who doesn't love coffee ice cream? But, who the heck has ever had Vietnamese Coffee? Do it. You won't be sorry.

Let me tell you about my friend, Chopped Brisket. I try not to eat a lot of red meat, but when I crave it, only few things will satisfy the craving. Dickey's Chopped Brisket is one of them. Paired with a half-roll/half-biscuit and any of their sides, I recommend splitting the sweet tea with the unsweetened tea. Don't forget ice cream at the end.   The staff is unpredictable, some of the young girls can be very unprofessional, but it doesn't stop me from a repeat visit.

What a pleasant medical office experience. I don't recall a shorter wait any other place. Xrays taken, reviewed, and a treatment plan discussed within about a half hour. Dr. Raia is a great guy to see for an upper extremity issue!

Very glad Cane's made their way to Arizona...it was one thing I missed about living in Las Vegas! It's not close to home, but always worth the drive for fresh, hot and delicious food and great service. The staff is friendly, the restaurant is clean and it is cheap comfort food.

This place, you'd think, would be a quick and easy lunch spot, but between placing our order and receiving our food, caterpillars turned to butterflies... The staff was very much not cut out to be in the service industry. Zero personality at the register. Once we did get our food, it was so salty, it couldn't be finished.

Bin68 = bottom of barrel. Worse food and wine experience I've ever had. Poorest ingredients, limited and lackluster food menu...which is sad, because four new, good wines and twenty bucks at the grocery would really improve things. And, sangria should have a hint of fruit, not motor oil.

I love Sauce in its natural form, and the fact that it is now available @ Sky Harbor Airport just means I'm guaranteed delicious eats when I travel. My favorite item is the vegetable salad, and the summer special is a salad, pizza and two glasses of wine for $20 -- perfect for pre-flight jitters!

Great neighborhood shop for a handful of Italian items that you aren't going to find at your local grocery store. I stopped in to pick up an ingredient I couldn't pronounce (I showed a picture from my smartphone) and was quickly directed to it!

I think I've made my face pretty well-known at this venue since it opened last month. Friendly staff and management, clean restaurant and that fresh Chipotle flavor everyone should know and love by now.  This neighborhood needed a Chipotle! I only hope Trader Joe's is next to fill some of the empty retail space.

Sometimes I feel like I've tried all the places in the East Valley, but this is by far my favorite. Service is fast and consistently good, while the prices are right, also. The technicians are creative in their nail art and even a standard manicure is done well enough that it isn't ruined by the time you get home.

When a midweek brunch can bring back fond nostalgia of flavors from a childhood you never had, it's a big win. First, let's talk Mornin' Moonshine, shall we? Truly a stellar coffee product that is created with care and precision that you can taste. It's as artful as it is delicious.   I knew it was more than I could eat, but I had to order the b.m.o.c., which is a waffle topped with a pork chop and eggs. This dish is also garnished with a Portuguese donut. My husband ordered the savory crepes, which were topped with a red pepper sauce that replaces ketchup in my book.   Truly satisfying, tasty and the service was top-notch despite the order-at-the-counter-and-pick-a-seat setup.

This is my favorite Dutch Bros. location in the valley. The crew is always so nice and quick and the coffee is excellent. I tend to bounce between Starbucks, Dunkin and Dutch because, let's face it... East Mesa is pretty lacking on the unique coffee shops.

This was a great stop to satisfy an Italian craving. I loved that "Extra Virgin" (Debi Mazar + hubby cooking show) was on in the background in the lunch hour. A solid offering and lots of power flavors from the antipasto plate to the pasta.

Finding this jewel not too far from my own backyard has made trouble for me as I can't stay away! Tacos al carbon as good as it gets, good prices and quick, friendly service. This place is full of character, too. You will have a hard time picking a favorite between the carne asada and chicken items.

I'm revisiting my review now that it's safe to say I've had everything on the menu. Where has this Crazy Potato been all my life? (Papa Loca) I was in Backyard Taco and the owner himself took my order and introduced me to a new stampcard. Buy 10, get 1 meal free (up to $5). My guess is, I will have filled this card in about two weeks. My favorite items are the tacos on corn tortillas, the steak tostada and now the potato. The chips and salsa are delicious as well, and complimentary with your Yelp check-in. Great that they're open late, too.

Where has this place been all my life? I would love a Salad and Go on every corner. No longer is limited time an excuse to make poor dietary choices.  Enough of my rant...tried this place for the first time today and already know I'm going back tomorrow. Mr. and I shared a breakfast wrap that was packed with great breakfast flavors such as savory bacon and seasoned potatoes paired with greens and pico de gallo. Truly a breakfast of champions. I also purchased a salad for lunch (to be eaten later) and am impressed with the quality of the ingredients awaiting me.  Quick and friendly service as well

This is not a Chinese restaurant, but rather a loud middle-aged bar that happens to serve Chinese food. Food was mediocre, service was lousy and it is not the right venue for the percussion-heavy live music they provide.

My first time eating at Snooze was in San Diego - a highlight of that vacation - so I was beyond excited to see them land in Phoenix, too! The menu is genius, really there is something for every taste. I'm a savory breakfast foods fan, but the pineapple upside down or blueberry danish pancake could change my mind again and again.

Where has this place been all of my desert life? Everything they've given me to put in my mouth has been amazing. I would compare their Lobster Bisque to World Famous in San Diego. Fish and Chips are killer. $2 Fish Tacos on Monday are terrific. Cioppino is a pleaser. Seabass, excellent. For the non-seafoodie, Famous Fried Chicken hits the spot. Service is great as well.

Long live the local independent bookstore! In the case of my favorite, Changing Hands, they're actually growing! Walking into the Tempe store is like coming home to your parents' living room after being away at college... ahhh, the comfort of cozy quirks and smells. This location in the former BeefEaters is like coming home from college to find the parents have renovated and there's a bar where your room used to be. The shop always offers a treat and a gift for any occasion!

A nice surprise and change of pace from the typical "What do you want" / "I don't care-whatever you want" conversation that is the theme song of marriage. Good flavors for any palate, but be brave and choose an empanada path. You also cannot go wrong with a Cubano sandwich. If only for dessert...I repeat: empanada. Very Berry is much like berry pie and peach almond was more cobbleresque.

Upon driving by the "coming soon" on my daily AJ's run, I looked up Tokyo Joe's and learned all about its rich Colorado history. A few months into my gluten avoidance, I welcomed the idea of a fresh Asian spot in the neighborhood. They've not quite been open a week and I've visited them three times, trying something new every time. The Gyoza is a delicious starter, the sushi rolls are great and the bowls, soups and salads offer a variety of flavors sure to never get boring. My husband ordered a green curry and his response was: Aside from the searing burn on my tongue, this is flavorless. I have personally enjoyed the General Joe's soup, MoJoe bowl and I've built my own. I'm sure to be a regular here.
