Friendliest and most talented nail technicians. This place is amazing, my friend and I have been coming here since middle school, up to our twenties now. I have been to different nail salons across the valley and I continually come back to Tommy's above all others. If you're looking to have  top notch, long lasting, and incredible nail work done, come to Tommy's.

I cannot get enough of this restaurant. Don Lencho's is family owned and operated and serving up some amazingly delicious mariscos (seafood) and mexican food. Some of my favorite dishes include: menudo, chilaquiles with carne asada, and the vulve la vida (seafood cocktail with octopus, oysters, shrimp and clams). I always leave completely satisfied and find myself craving this food practically every day! Happy hour is also available every day which offers a wide variety of affordable drinks. Try the Mango Margarita, yum.

Horrible service. As many other reviewers have stated, if you are not a regular expect to wait close to an hour while others around that arrived, after you, are served. Completely rude and unapologetic staff. Charged us for a roll that was never even served, after waiting over an hour. After coming here frequently a couple years prior, any fond memory is destroyed with my most recent visit in addition to multiple other reviewers.

A friend and I tried Thirteen North for dinner last night for the first time, and we were so pleased with our experience.   Service was very personable and engaging. We had conversations with most of the staff and it definitely added to the experience. The atmosphere at this restaurant is very ambient and inviting. Great patio area as well.   For dinner we both opted for seafood entrees. I had the pan seared Walleye pike and my friend had the salmon. We swapped tastes of our dishes and both were fantastic! Each entree was accompanied with a saut√©ed veggie medley and orzo. Yum yum! Dinner entrees also come with choice of soup or salad. All of this was under $20 each and well worth it!   Will definitely be returning to this great find. Hoping to try their breakfast soon as well because it looks very tasty!

Everytime I visit Lenero, it is an exceptional experience. Service is always great and the ambience alone keeps me coming back.   Now the food-- oh my gosh, so delicious! You can tell everything is thoughtfully prepared and fresh.   The skirt steak and shredded lamb are my favorite entrees and a must try.   The queso fundido app--melted cheese, chorizo, and fresh flour tortillas-- how could you not love it?! House specialty cocktails are incredible also. Try the A La Luna, made with fresh basil and cilantro vodka (all their cocktails contain no artificial additives, awesome)  There is something for everyone to love here and it is a great addition to the neighborhood. I will continue returning to Lenero because I'm always guaranteed a fabulous dining experience and what more could you ask for? Keep it up, Lenero!

As someone who frequented the Deer Valley location, I was ecstatic when Times Square opened a location across the street from my house!   I try to come here at least a couple times a month, because I'm always craving their delicious food. I'm never let down when I dine at this restaurant.   Food is outstanding, along with the customer service.   Try coming in for breakfast also, because it's terrific!! There is something for everyone to like here.   Prices are reasonable, service is friendly, and the food can't be beat.   Welcome to the neighborhood, Times Square, you're an excellent culinary addition!

Wow. Worst customer service experience in my life. Enough said.  But... Let me elaborate.  Besides the fact that there are supposedly 19 owners... They're all perverts and sketchy  as f$&@k.   Not to mention one of the business owners was visibly WASTED and practically falling over himself while simultaneously bombarding one of my girlfriends with his failed attempts at "flirting".   As women, it's pretty much the most uncomfortable experience  you can have to be harassed by staff all night.   Will not be coming back and will not recommend any girlfriends coming here.
