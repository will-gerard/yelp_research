I've been passing this place daily for 3 years. Finally stopped in for a chorizzo burrito. What a mistake. Now I know that the best breakfast burrito in the world is right there waiting. Time to either change my commute route or buy bigger clothes. I would have stopped years earlier, but from the street it looks a bit scary.  That's obviously by design, and I wouldn't let that stop you if you have been considering trying it out.

This is my favorite Home Depot location, and luckily it now also happens to be my closest to home.  They are well laid out, and keep everything stocked.  Put a confused look on your face, and it is never more than a few seconds before someone asks if you need assistance.  On the rare occasion that I have had a less than perfect experience, a quick mention of this to customer service gets that corrected 110%.

I have been to other Ono locations, and had good food.  I tried this one twice (thought the first time was just a bad fluke).  What I go was fatty, bad tasting food with slow service. Did I mention the parking lot is 1/2 the size it needs to be? Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, I'm telling.

Best ribs I have ever had.  Pulled pork and fried corn was excellent as well.  Very reasonably priced, and it has a fun atmosphere as well.   I will be back!

I live in Power Ranch, so its a toss up as to whether its more convenient to go here or the Home Depot on Power Rd.  I've tried both multiple times, and I find a HUGE difference.  At this Lowe's, its very hard in every department to get someone to help.  The layout seems to have been designed to hide what I'm looking for.  I'm glad they are here as an alternative for that occasion where that "other" store doesn't have what I need, but from now on it is always option B for me.

I come from a small Arizona town, and while I like several "chain" Mexican food restaurants, I have missed that REAL Mexican food flavor. Here it is, found again, at El Rey Cafe! If you are looking for a fancy place with white tablecloths and china, this is not your restaurant. But if you are looking for friendly service and crazy good food, you've just found it. So far I've tried and loved the butter chips, salsa, green chile, red chile, and chile relleno.  Looking forward to consuming the rest of the menu soon.
