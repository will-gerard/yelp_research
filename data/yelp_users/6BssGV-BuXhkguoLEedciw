I was excited to have lunch at what appeared to be a place that would offer a nice dining experience. Unfortunately I will never go back, as the meal was quite mediocre, the service/waitress failed at bringing life and personality. Overall I was surprisingly disappointed with the experience. "Never judge a book by its cover," well, from the exterior this restaurant appeared to be nice and lively, but unfortunately it failed to measure up to the minimum level of expectations.

Fantastic service, great Ramen, reasonably priced, you have to visit this place, you'll be hooked after the first visit!

After seeing all of the great reviews on Yelp I was so excited to visit the watershed. Outside seating was beautiful, simply beautiful! The huckleberry lemonade was a fantastic drink! The problem with everything else! After looking at all the pictures on Yelp I was prepared to either try the nachos or the crab cakes because both look delectable. Unfortunately upon arrival we learned that they no longer serve the nachos and they have a seasonal menu, in fact, they will have four different menu's throughout the year for each season. No bueno! There was nothing on the menu that seems appealing, I ended up getting the grilled mahi mahi sandwich which was bland, very tasteless, and the herb potatoes were mediocre! So then I decided to try the jambalaya, big mistake, even worse the rice was mushy and again very bland. The watershed would be an amazing place to celebrate birthdays, holidays, or just hang out with friends, your husband/wife, or boyfriend/girlfriend,  it definitely has a great outdoor atmosphere but unfortunately you leave hungry, very hungry. In fact we had to leave and visit another restaurant just to actually eat a meal for the evening. I was so looking forward to visiting the watershed but it was very underwhelming!
