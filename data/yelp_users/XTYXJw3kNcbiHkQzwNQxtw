I always like coming here.  The environment is always relaxing and the staff is amazing. They have the best meat and cheese boards as well! Price is decent and its a great place if you are looking to relax and hang out with a group of friends.

I initially came here for an yearly eye examine and because the reviews here on yelp. Making the appointment was very easy and i was able to get in as a new patient within a week. The office is very clean and the atmosphere upon arriving is very welcoming. The optometrist, Kelly, was fantastic. She was very nice, friendly, and took the time to get my prescription right. I have very bad eye sight and its always hard to get my prescription right. But like i stated prior, she took the time to ensure everything was right and i felt comfortable with what i choose. The one thing i can say, is they carry a lot of designer frames which make the cost of the frames slightly higher (in my opinion). However, the quality of care you receive here makes it fully worth it! I would highly recommend them.

I hate to have to give this location a bad review because I come here so often and have always had a really great experience. I have been coming here almost weekly (sometimes more than once a week) for the past year during lunch time. Every time our bill is usually $70 or more, mainly due to our drinks!   However, the past few times we have gone here, have been really bad. We walk in, sit at the bar area where we normally sit, and then we wait....and wait..and wait. One time we waited 15 mins before the bartender even appeared. I would have walked out and gone else where if I wasn't such a fan of this location.   Just last week our bartender (she had Blonde hair) was probably the worst I have ever experienced. I ordered a Coconut Sakerita and it didn't taste like coconut at all! It tasted like the lime sour mix they put in it. I have had this drink before an know what its suppose to taste like..and it is not suppose to taste like that. The worst part about it is that it didn't even tasted like coconut one bit. Then she disappeared again for 20 mins. Thank goodness for this other waitress that walked by who seen how annoyed I looked. She came over and offered her assistance with getting us another drink, in which she had no problem making the coconut drink correctly. Our group ended up being over 30 mins late back to work because of how slow our bartender was and her annoyingly long disappearances.   Most recently, yesterday, we came here again for lunch. We sat down and waited about 5 mins before we seen the bartender. Again the Coconut drink was made wrong. Our food was extremely slow to come out and there was hardly anyone there.   I have always loved this location. Their food is usually always really good, never really had an issue with it, Aside from the garlic edamame (I believe they changed their recipe casing them to be more greasy than before...which isn't a good thing). The staff has always been really nice, fast, and attentive. However, these past few weeks have really gone down hill. The staff really needs to be trained better on service and how to make their drinks. And there should never be a time where a customer is waiting wondering where the heck the bartender is. As stated before, I have been a very loyal customer to this specific location, always giving great reviews to my peers, however, I cannot say I can continue to unless something drastically changes.

Since writing my last review, this location has improved tremendously. Mind you, my last review was directly mostly towards a specific bartender who seemed to not know exactly how to make their signature drinks and lacked in the customer service department. Since then, i have been there a few times, and i can say I'm back to being a regular customer. After writing my last review, I was promptly responded to by the regional manger. They advised that the necessary steps were being taken to ensure my experience would not be experience by others or myself again. Since, I can honestly say the experience has improved drastically. Our server today, Anu, was amazing. We had him a few other times and he is super friendly and makes our drinks perfectly (cute too)! If you ever get a chance to served by him, you will be pleasantly surprised at his level of customer service!

I love this place, the only complaint I have is that every time I come here for lunch, they are sold out of snickerdoodle cookies. I'm sure this is one of their top sellers, so I would think they would be prepared for the afternoon lunch rush and ensure they do not run out. Unfortunately this has not been the case the past 4 times I have gone here for lunch. All in all the service is usually really good. Food has always been really good!

Typically I have have always had a mediocre experience at this Applebees. This time however was probably the worst I have experience so far. I do not expect much out of this location however anything worse then my typical experience is unacceptable.   Wait time: anytime I go it's usually between 5 and 6 so the wait time is usually always around 15 minutes. This time the wait time was the same but the greeter didn't even greet me with a Hello welcome to Applebees.  Instead I had to go up to her and ask her to put my name down.  Waitress: After being seated we didn't see our waitress for another 10 minutes.  This means we didn't even order our drinks yet. Finally when she made an appearance we gave her our drink order, ice tea and sprite. Took another 10 minutes.   Food: I get the same thing every time, steak and veggies. My 6 year old daughter got the 4 ounce steak from the kids menu. Medium rare for both of us. Took about 15 mins to get our food which was typical... but this time my steak looked like one of those processed steaks. Like the kind you buy in the bag at the grocery store precooked. It was done med well. My daughters 4 ounce steak, which looked like a small hockey puck,  was rarer than mine.  My steak tasted funny, I couldn't even finish it all. And it comes with seasonal veggies which happens to be broccoli,  ALL YEAR ROUND.  Half way through eating I was done with my ice tea awaiting a refill that never came. When we were done eating we waited for about another 15 mins for our waiting who I had not seen for at least 25 mins prior. I had to ask the buss boy to get her for me. My daughter really wanted desert and it was out date night so I agreed even though I just wanted to leave at this point. When our waitress finally came around I gave her the order we got the dessert soon after, and then we did some more for her to come back around so we could get the check. 10 minutes goes by again and she finally chose her face and asked if we want the check.   I did overhear her talking with the table behind us saying that she only started about a week ago, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to she was new. I still gave her a $5 tip on a 30 dollar bill only because of this reason.  All in all I do not think I will go to this location again not so much because of the experience I had with the waitress but more on the food was less than mediocre this time and I couldn't even finish it.

I love this place and probably my favorite place to go for Pho. Not only is it delicious, its also very cost friendly. Every time I have gone, i was seated, waited on, and served within 5-10 mins.  I live in laveen but whenever i am in the mood for Pho, i drive the extra miles just to come to this place.

So much to choose from! It's a Wine lovers paradise! First time i was there was about 2 weeks ago. I could have spent hours in there! There was a man that came up to me, asked me a few questions towards my taste and found me the perfect bottle of wine!

This is the worst bank I've ever banked with in my entire life!!!!! They say TCF Stands for customer comes first... It's could not be more off!!!! Should've known from the start of signing up with them they were a huge mistake to go with! Nothing but problems in getting my debit card, The customer service I have experienced is absolutely horrible, and now they hit me with three overdraft fees in a row!!! Seriously just want to cancel this bank account now I can't because I'm hostage to paying them over $100 in overdraft fees!!!!! I am very careful about my spending money so to have three overdraft fees seems absolutely ridiculous!!!! Out of people signed up at my work with this bank, models every single one of them have already closed their account because of issues they've had with this bank. Everyone should do themselves a favor and skip this bank when considering their banking options!!!!

I stayed here on valentines day. The room look was very nice. Clean and slick looking. I loved the bathroom. The tub and shower are separate, not to mention the shower is a waterfall shower. There were only two complaints i have. The first was the bathroom door. It just slide shut but not really all the way. It was kind of like what a closet door would be like. Made me feel like the other person in the room could hear EVERYTHING. Being a girl, bathroom time is a very private occasion. The other complaint was the bed. You would think this nice of a hotel would have a nice comfy bed with nice comfy blankets. However, this was not the case. The blanket didn't even keep me warm through the night, i had to get another blanket out of the closet. The mattress was on the harder side and the pillows were horrible...very lumpy.  Honestly i have slept on better mattresses at a holiday inn than here. Overall though the room and the stay was good.

My boyfriend and I came here for a pre vday dinner. It was the first time being here for both of us and we were excited to see what all the fuss was about. Our dinner reservation was for 930pm so we called at 8 to see if they could possibly fit is in sooner. They lady said "yes come in and we will seat you as soon as possible" and informed us we could hang out in the lounge. So we came in and waited...and waited...and waited. 9pm came around, we were still waiting. Given that our reservation wasn't until 930, i remained patient. 930 comes around, then 945... This whole time watching people come in and get seated right away or soon after arriving. Finally at 10:10pm they finally came over and said they were ready for us. We were pretty much the last to be seated even with arriving an hour and half before our reservation!!! By this point I didn't even want to eat there anymore but we waited that long, my as well try it out. Going in I was expected to see room full of people which would make the long wait acceptable. Instead the room was half empty.. And to top it off we were seated in the middle of the room with little privacy, even though they had open seats next to the windows with beautiful views. Our view was the couple in the booth in front of our table making out and taking selfie after selfie. The only good thing I can say about whole thing was the food. The food was really good. I had the salmon and my boyfriend had the rib eye steak which both were cooked perfectly. This however, did not make up for the complete lack of service from the hosts. Needless to say I will not be going here again nor will I recommend this restaurant to anyone. Such a disappointment.

I placed 3 orders for pick up and suprisingly they said it would be ready in 10 mins. When I got there the food was already waiting for me at the conter. The lady who checked me out, although was nice and professional, was not as personable as I thought she could have been. She did not say good morning or how are you doing. Instead she goes "pick up?" In which I reply ed yes and began the check out.  Now for the food. Food was pretty good. I had the biscuit special. It was pretty food. Their sausage gravy didn't appear to have any sausage in it till I realized what I thought was mushrooms was actually the sausage. Regardless everything was pretty good. Eggs were delicious! Would definitely recommend this place  Next time I'll eat in.

BEST PEANUT SAUCE I HAE EVER HAD!  I am a spring roll fanatic and I'm always in search of great spring rolls and sauce.. And this place takes the medal for the best peanut sauce. I have had 100's of different sauce in my time due to my boyfriend being Vietnamese and always taking me to different hole in the wall mom and pop shops. Their pho is pretty good but the best out of what I had was their peanut sauce! Yummy

I really liked this place. It's right next door to my daughter's gymnastic place so it's nice to just go in and just look around. The lady who helped me last time was very helpful! I definitely will be coming here every week to see what's new

Overall the food was pretty good. We went during the peak time so our wait was about 30 mins for 2 people. I got their pancake special with sausage and scramble eggs. Instead of the regular pancakes it comes with I added raspberry chocolate chip pancakes for 2$ more. The pancakes were really good! Sausage was delicious as well. They were nice and plump full of flavor. And let's not forget about their orange juice. It was so good. I even watched the lady freshly squeeze it. Service was great as well. Definitely a place I will go again!

Ive been to Maya a few different times, each time same experience. Yes, drinks are priced highly,  full of the typical crowd you would find in Scottsdale, but the venue itself is pretty cool. Plus they have an awesome selection of DJ's that come there. My suggestion, pregame prior to going to save on cost, expect the typical high end Scottsdale crowd, and go with a good group of people.

The place is up kept very well and the prices are very reasonable. I was very impressed! Next time ill bring my friend so she can see what i have been boasting about.

I love coming here during my lunch hour! They have the best pizza! A coworker and I have tired every pizza on the menu and just cannot decide which is our favorite!   The only thing I think they can improve on is the wait staff. Although they are very friendly and helpful, they tend to disappear for a while after you get your first round of drinks. If they could improve this i would give them a 5 star!

I want to start off by saying i am so glad i found this place! Brian has been fantastic!   I originally went to Fletcher's for an oil change and for them to take a look at my roaters (i knew they were wearing down). Fletcher's was quoting me almost $3000 to replace my roaters, strut hats, and mentioned something about some leaks that were causing my roaters to go bad. Since $3000 is a pretty penny, i decided to get a second option.   I found Slaughter here on Yelp and all i can say is im an so glad i did. I dropped my car off in the morning and by mid after noon they called me with the results. I had bad roaters and he mentioned my strut hats and possible struts should be replaced. Then he stated that he would like to take a deeper look into why when i turn there is a clunking noise (a noise i heard but didn't think twice about it). What some great service. After they checked over my vehicle (free by the way), they quoted me way less for the work. In fact they stated that nothing was even leaking! In the end the car repairs will only cost me around $890! Drastic difference to Fletcher $3000 they were quoting me!  Its not ever day you find an honest car repair shop, but i can honestly say this one is one of them! I have no doubt i will be a continued customer and refer people as much as possible!

I was pretty unsatisfied with this place. I was excited to try it and although our waiter was great, what we ordered was less than great. We ended up ordering a pizza and bruschetta. The bruschetta was had way too much onion in it for my liking but I understand every place makes it differently. What was most upsetting is that the pizza AND bruschetta bread were burnt! And I don't mean toasted, it was blackened burnt. The only reason we didn't send it back was because they were on the verge of closing and we didn't want to inconvenience them by having them remake it. I find it disturbing that they would actually allow for this to come out of the kitchen though, regardless of the time of night. To be honest I don't think I will be coming back here.

Came here the other day for lunch for the first time. I can honestly say I am a fan! You can make your pizza any way you want. The best part about the pizza is the thin crispy crust. Definitely will be coming back here

I went here about a week ago with a few friends since we never has been. I got the ring of fire burger which was amazing tasting. it was almost too spicy for me and i love spicy food. The environment is great as well. We went on a Wednesday night and the place was packed, but we were seated right away which was nice. Will definitely go back!

service at this location could have been better. way to long of a wait to be seated (went on a Wednesday night little people in there).  The lady at the door seen us came in but proceeded to flirty with the guy in front of us waiting for the rest of their party. Once seated, we still waited 5 mins before anyone came over to us to ask what we wanted to drink. Once we ordered never did get our bibs (signature item). And we were only checked up on ONCE during out whole time there. Overall, very disappointing and will NOT visit this location again. Do yourself a favor and go to another location.
