Ick.  Have you people ever tasted a gyro before?  This one was so salty I could barely get it down.  I find it interesting that the reviews are so split on this place-I'm guessing that most of the four and five stars hit up this joint post drinking on State street.  I went in hoping for a quick and delicious Greek meal before I had to make my way to the airport but was sorely disappointed when I received my sandwich.  The pita was yummy, but it was filled with dry, overly salty meat of questionable origin, too many onions, and a pile of sauce.    If I lived in Wisconsin, you couldn't pay me to go back. In fact, if you paid for my travel to Wisconsin and for my lunch, I wouldn't go back.

This building is beautiful, with an absolutely stunning view of the lake.  I recently visited for a multi-day conference and was really impressed with the space.  The food I thought was of variable quality...although still impressive given that they were catering for about 2600 people.  (And in the seven meals I had there I felt like they had a nice amount of variety).  The rooftop is gorgeous- with terraced gardens, a giant fountain, and a small restaurant that serves snacks and cocktails.

Marigold's takes the cake for the most delicious poached eggs I've ever had.  Talk about a food memory, I was here for a conference weeks ago and I can still remember the chili poached eggs with prosciutto and manchego cheese.  And with coffee and a tip, it was still less than $12.  Fan-tas-tic.  The place is sunny and clean, the staff is friendly, and everyone at my table was blown away by the quality of their food.  I was particularly jealous of my friend's French toast, which was piled high with berries and looked truly excellent.  Definitely worth a stop-in for brunch!

Wow, this is a big airport!  And it has copious amount of slot machines for those who just can't wait.  There's a nice selection of typically overpriced stores and restaurants to enjoy while you wait.  I found it to be well-organized, waited for a minimal amount of time to go through security, and loved that the check-in kiosks could be used for any of the airlines.  The staff was friendly and they have free wi-fi!

Things to love about Southwest Air: 1. Open seating. 2. Bags fly free! 3. I find that the selection of direct flights is better/cheaper than other carriers. 4. I enjoyed a ton of free snacks on my most recent cross-country flight. 5. Friendly and sometimes snarky/humorous flight crew. 6. You can check in with your phone application!  Things to not love about Southwest Air: 1. Open seating.  Sometimes you can't register quite soon enough.  Then you end up in the C group probably sitting by people that take over parts of your seat or screaming babies. 2. They don't fly everywhere.

After reading the reviews on Yelp!, I was worried about staying here.  Especially after I looked through the photos!  Yikes!  The good news, though, is that it was so, so much better than expected.    Its location on the park is awesome-it's so close to the convention center and the lakes in either direction are accessible and lovely.  The rooms were clean, and much more updated than in those pictures.  And they have refrigerators!  Not mini bars that are prestocked with things, but actual fridges where you can stow your leftovers from dinner or your six pack of Spotted Cow.  Our room was a little weird, in that it had a sliding glass door that opened into the pool area.  Mainly, we were creeped out by this and kept the curtain securely drawn, but I imagine if you wanted to use the pool or work-out facility, then this would be convenient instead of creepy.  No problems with the thermostat, desk persons, cleaning staff, or excessive noise.

This restaurant was FANTASTIC!  We had Saturday night reservations and were given a table just inside the windows with an excellent view of the Bellagio fountains.  Our waiter was incredibly friendly and attentive.  We loved the tapenade and bread spread that accompanied our cocktails and everyone's food was absolutely delicious (two different pastas, a duck dish, and a fish dish). Everyone ended the meal full and happy-topped off with chocolate cake and coffee.

Stopped in this place with a large party at dinner time, all needing separate checks, expecting the worst and was so, so pleasantly surprised!  They've got about a million local beers on tap, and our waiter was fantastic and brought samples of beers before we committed to ordering them.  The fried cheese curds were delicious, as were both of the cheese plates that my table ordered.  I ordered one of the specials for dinner-a really delicious BLT made with local tomatoes and served with a HUGE side salad.  (I'm usually prepared to be disappointed with the size or quality of a side salad, but this one had dark leafy greens, a tangy vinaigrette, and was beautifully fresh).  Definitely worth a try if you're in the area.

Ah, the view from the top!  The visit to the Ghost Bar at the Palms was a great welcome to Vegas on our first night out.  The view is absolutely stunning, of course, everyone probably thinks so which is why it's a little crowded up there.  Drinks are average priced by Vegas standards-and while some of the tipsy ladies get the dropsies and let their glasses careen to the concrete floor...there is an effective security team in place with a flashlight, a broom, and a dustpan that very quickly take care of the spills (and more importantly, the broken glass, lest it get trapped in the paws of a dancing lady who has forgone her heels for the evening).    I was a bit disappointed in the glass floor to see down-the glass was really clouded, and I couldn't get a very good view at all.  Also not the most interactive crowd...had a great time with my compatriots though, so it might be best to BYO party.

Sirrico's was the perfect place for a pre-show snack before Zumanity.  For about six dollars I got a GIANT slice of Hawaiian pizza with perfect chewy crust.  May not be the best restaurant in Vegas, but if you're pressed for time and want a quick bite in the streets of New York, New York, it's an excellent choice.

Had a fantastic experience at Planet Hollywood on a recent stay.  Loved many things about the place:  1. The rooms were beautiful and very comfortable.  Ours was decorated with Ghostbusters memorabilia which was just fun.   2. The casino was buzzing and had a young vibe. 3. Ate at their restaurant several times, and while the service was slow, it was always friendly and the food was good.  Especially good for late night snacks. 4. LOVED the pool area.  Amazing rooftop area, fun DJ, and plenty of chairs. 5. Proximity to other fun spots on the strip, including Paris and the Bellagio. 6. The concierge hooked us up with some last minute tickets to Cirque.  Unfortunately, check-in and check-out seem to have quite a queue...but that may because we (like many other patrons, apparently) waited until the absolute last possible moment to check-out.

This was an excellent airport experience.  The staff was friendly, there are a lot of choices (for its size) for eats while you wait, and security was fast and easy.  I thought the chairs at the gate were cozy and they'd even installed outlets with extra plugs so that everyone can recharge their devices before take-off.

This cheese store was delightful!  Conveniently located right next to my hotel, it was a great place to wander around at the epicurean delights.  I wanted to take everything home with me, and after careful consideration, adopted several of the 'cheese orphans' that hang out in front of the cash register as the small pieces leftover from the larger blocks of cheese.  They've got them sorted into 'Wisconsin' and 'non-Wisconsin' so that you can decide if you want to stick to locals or not.  It was a great choice for a little cheese tasting party of my very own, many, many miles away.  They've also got some mad-delicious looking sandwiches.

Had the most fabulous Sundae here.  It had several flavors of ice cream (including coffee yummmm), an entire piece of peanut butter pie, chocolate fudge, and whipped cream and it required no less than four of us to eat all of it.  Probably the best sundae I've ever had.  Had a great selection of food and I loved the fun decor.  I was a bit disappointed in my burger (brie and avocado should have been fabulous, but feel a little bit tasteless and flat), but the portions were nice and the fries were good.

"Oh, look," I say, "They have a 'to-go' counter."  But not an expedient one.  You order off of the menu and then they make your food, and if you're me, then they make the wrong thing and have to make it again.  So twenty minutes later, you can go catch up with your friends and actually board your plane.  They did give me the botch, though, which was a nice bonus.  Food was a little bland and not quite as delicious as I'd been hoping for.  I also found the breakfast sandwich a little difficult to eat while I was sitting on the plane, worrying that I wouldn't be able to bite into the giant bread without squirting over-easy egg onto everything surrounding me.    Sadly, it's about the only restaurant in this terminal, though it looks as though they might be building another one.
