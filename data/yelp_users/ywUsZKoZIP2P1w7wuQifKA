I got to the airport a little under two hours prior to my flight only to learn I couldn't print my boarding pass because they "weren't open yet". Then the process to check my bag took longer than going through security because the kiosks were unresponsive and not user friendly. One of my worst airport experiences and I'm not even on the plane yet.

I frequent this establishment and generally ignore the poor service, but after my latest encounter they have lost me as a customer. I waited 30 min to even be acknowledged only to have longer waits for food and drinks. I have never had worse service.

Alex came for a same day service call, showed up early and was very efficient in his approach to fixing our system. We have an older unit, so naturally it malfunctioned again the next day, and when I called him he walked me through the trouble shooting over the phone. I highly recommend using their service.

I consider myself a bit of a steakhouse snob and I generally hold them to the highest standard, but Steak 44 exceeded all my expectations and more. It started with the service. Our waitress Alyssa was honest, fun, attentive, and an overall joy to be around. We will go back just to see her. We ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer and it was phenomenal. Great flavor and the perfect size for a few people to snack on. We each had steaks and I must say the 22oz bone-in rib eye was one of the best steaks I have ever had. The corn creme brûlée is a must, as are the roasted Brussel sprouts and the lobster mashed potatoes. Finally, the atmosphere was terrific. It seemed like a place where the staff will know your name and that is what will keep us going back. If you're lucky enough to get Alyssa as your waitress you will have a great meal with even better service.
