I loved this place when I was in college. Now as a young professional I love coming in here to watch football and have a couple beverages. One thing it is for sure a Chargers bar which gets interesting when I'm trying to watch my Giants but the food is awesome (Loaded Tater Tots) and at a good price. Give it a try if you are on Mill and don't want to do a dance club like myself. Make sure you bring your I.D. and even though I'm getting quite a few years away from 21 they examine it hardcore.

So I have been to this place twice and I have some good things to say and some bad things to say. First the food is not bad actually pretty good for bar food. Second the beer selections are awesome great craft beers which are always changing I'm a man I like variety so thank you. The big reason for the 2 star is the service. I have never been wowed here in fact the last server we had actually got into a verbal attack with the mother in law because she had asked for a discount because the server forgot to put some of the food on the order and it came out 15 minutes after the rest. Her answer was well you ate it and this is a business. Sorry but really that is the worst answer I have ever heard. I will be back but will ask to be seated in another section. I understand people have bad days so I cant ever say I wont return because of one, but if it happens again that is another story

So this place as a few things going for it. One the Burgers are solid, way better than a Fast Food burger but of course not like the homemade ones at home. Second Smash Fries are great I recommend splitting with someone if each are getting a burger. Lastly but most important they sell beer here, which if you get a bucket of four beers, it is only $8 you can do the math and realize best price in town especially with their choices of Micro brews. So if your going to see a movie and want to get a couple of beers and some food, solid place to go.

I agree with these people. This place rocks very good. I tried the Pecan which I was told takes two days to make. Well done very good Betty. If you are walking down mill and want a little snack make sure you stop here

The opolis of Pork was very good. Fried pickles were excellent as well as the pulled pork. Only suggestion I would have would be on the sides. My wife received the mac and cheese as her side which was delicious and a huge serving. When it came to my baked beans very good but tiny portion. It almost felt like I didn't really get any. I would just suggest getting the mac and cheese cause you get a lot more food for the price
