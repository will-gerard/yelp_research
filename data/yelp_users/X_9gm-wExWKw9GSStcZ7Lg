I love this Safeway store.  Great produce, friendly employees and prices are low.  The store is clean.  They carry most of my items.

I have been seeing Dr. Bruce Schwartz since 2008 and thanks to his expert experience, I have a beautiful smile!  The office is clean, the staff is friendly and my appointments are on time.  Don't wait, call today and make an appointment.

Joann Fabric has a large craft section but was not carrying the extension posts to expand my scrapbook.  Why carry Scrapbooking items without these?  Great selection of paper.  Staff is friendly and checkout is fast.

Costco continues to keep my business because they have great products, helpful employees and quick checkouts.  Great optical department with very large selection and low prices.

I love shopping at Macy's and finding beautiful clothes on sale.  They could open up a few more cash registers so the wait time is shorter.

I tried Elements Massage for the first time and have a very good massage.  I liked that they did not use aromas as they give me a headache.  The bed was comfortable which is very important to me as I had scoliosis and it hurts to lay down.  The intro price was a bonus.  The regular rate is a bit steep but I bought a 3-pack and was happy with this as I travel a lot and couldn't commit to a monthly plan.

Love to stop by for a taste of Heaven!  It is worth the parallel parking on some occasion!  Ha ha

Pizza was thin and crispy which is ok, but my biggest fear was of the black hair bearded man working on my pizza.  Luckily, no hairs on my pizza.
