here's a tip - they don't stock their shelves, so what's on display they might not have, and they often have discontinued items on display. lame.

so i don't know what happened here, this pharmacy used to be on top of it. now they take a long time to get to drive-through customers, long wait times and rude pharmacy techs.

walked in thinking i would simply order a pizza to go. WRONG!! after being greeted by shelby, i bellied up to the bar, ordered a beer, ordered my pizza, and then ordered spicy chicken dingers while i waited. best way to end a friday, i think. thanks, pullano's!!

Do not, I REPEAT DO NOT HAVE YOUR CAR WASHED HERE. They will steal loose change from your car, and who knows what else. I just finished having my car washed there and noticed all the quarters were taken out of my change compartment of my car. It's not the amount that bothers me ($2.00-$3.00 at most), it was the complete lack of respect for customer's property.  Also, the people who greet you when you pull up are hard sellers for detailing. What they don't tell you is the $200+ price tag that comes with it. Be wary with this place. Better yet, avoid it all together for a car wash. There are other more reputable places around.

unless you're a beautiful, young man, don't expect any service or any orderly delivery of food and beer. almost as if they don't want "others" here.

Finally, a decent Chinese joint in Goodyear that isn't a freaking chain! And they deliver! I love the BBQ pork fried rice and General Tso's Chicken. Great flavor. GO GO SMALL BUSINESS!!

Amazing dentist and staff. They were very attentive to my "fear" of dental work and calmed me down. The dental hygienist was one of the best I've ever experienced.

What a great place! I love the patio. They are friendly to cigar smokers. Jazz on the patio in Saturdays is relaxing with a great live jazz band. The revamped menu is delicious. Check it out!

first...hair found in sushi roll. second...screaming children. EVERWHERE. third...food was flavorless (except the 911 roll, which was very spicy and the best part of our meal).  service was ok. until it got busy, then we felt ignored.  so much for fusion sushi. we won't be returning.

I think this place closed. There's a notice on the door that says "Notice of Bankruptcy Chapter 7"

Love this place. I had the stacked nachos for lunch with pork, what a perfect size lunch! I love the chile rellenos and the enchiladas, some of the best in the valley. Food is fresh and bursts with flavor.

the service is AWFUL. the bartenders and servers are too busy looking at themselves in the mirror. this would be a much better PUB (you know, for public house) if the staff cared more about customers...and by customers, i mean the people who a) aren't staff friends, and b) don't look under 30.  if they improved on that, this would be a much better place to hang out and have a couple drinks.

The patty melt is one of the best in the West Valley. French fries are real, honest-to-God fresh potatoes. Nachos are freaking huge, be sure to share. Cheesecake is homemade. Great tap list. I needed a new neighborhood bar, looks like I found one  =D
