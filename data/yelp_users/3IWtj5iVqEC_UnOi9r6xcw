I went to Alex for the first time knowing that I wanted my hair shorter....but that was about it. I have never had good experiences with hair stylists. I either walk away with a boring hair cut I could've gotten for $15 at Super Cuts, or I walk away with a way-too-complicated cut that requires lots of product and styling to look like it did at the salon. Alex is the very first hair stylist who has ever really "got" me. She asked me questions, talked to me, listened to me and gave me the absolute perfect hair cut - one that I could not have described to her because I didn't even know it's what I wanted. She somehow interpreted my vague confusing tidbits of information and sculpted that communication into the absolute perfect hair cut. On top of that - she makes you feel special, welcome and pampered. You can tell she loves what she is doing - she is very passionate and present. She also gives a totally divine scalp and neck massage. I would pay to come back just to have her do that. Her salon is beautiful, her products are non-toxic and my whole experince at aBloom Salon was fantastic! I can't wait to go back!

What I loved: -Giant jacuzzi jet bathtub - fills up super fast, plenty of hot water -Extra large shower, great water pressure, water gets hot quick -Black out curtains -Comfy couch and furnishings -Plenty of pillows, extra blanket -toaster, blender and coffee maker in the kitchen -clean fridge and good dishwasher  What I was neutral to: -the bed. It wasn't terribly uncomfortable, but definitely wasn't awesome.  -the toiletries - cheap, small dollar store crap, but I'd imagine most bring their own anyway. -the bath towels - a step above the scratchy stuff you'd get at a motel six  Cons: -Super ghetto workout room. Very dingy and dirty, very tiny, and all of the weight machines were super old and creaky.  -Small pools. They boast 4 pools + a kids pool. Of the four pools, two are smaller than the average backyard swimming pool. The other two aren't that much bigger. All of the pool areas are super cramped. Not a lot of room to spread out or lounge. Pool towels are gross and thin. All of the hot tubs are small as well.  -Old plastic cooking utensils. Stainless steel pots and pans - any food you cook in these will stick to the point that it almost ruins the dish. Super hard to clean.  -No maid service, which is fine, but there's nothing available to clean the room yourself. No broom to do a quick sweep or vacuum or anything. You have to pay extra for maid service - that's your only option to keep your place clean.  -Only one towel hook. So nowhere to hang your towels.  -Not enough hangers in the closet, small dresser in the bedroom.

This is the best rooftop poolside bar in the city! The bartender, Jordan, is one of the best bartenders I have ever encountered. He treated us like royalty and was super friendly and welcoming. Had the chicken nachos - bomb! Crispy chips, lots of cheese and big piles of guac and salsa on top. Also had a few woodchuck ciders - love that they have the cider on tap! And serve it in a plastic tumbler so you can enjoy it poolside :)

I have been doing yoga regularly for 7+ years and have sampled many of the Phoenix area studios. I LOVE Funke Yoga for being down-to-earth, real humans. The owner, Mara, is so friendly and welcoming and the studio itself invites you to make yourself at home. I took my 50-something year old dad to his first yoga class ever and it was perfect. The class completely served me as a "seasoned" yoga participant, at the same time being the perfect class for my dad who knew absolutely nothing about yoga. Danielle is an amazing teacher! I definitely recommend the studio - I live in downtown Phoenix and it is worth the drive!

A classic, relaxing, therapeutic massage.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Melinda and will definitely be back.

Fantastic sandwiches! We shared the meatloaf and the ham sandwich. The meatloaf was DIVINE. The sauce was perfect and there was a bit of cole slaw on it that had a super lovely thai flavor. It was delicious. The ham was great too - yummy cheese and I loved the arugala on it. Will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. Super sweet girl behind the counter and overall a very inviting atmosphere that was lovely to hang out in.
