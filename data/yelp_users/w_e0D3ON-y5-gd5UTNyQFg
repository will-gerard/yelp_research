Slow service, not the first time I've received slow service here either. Cashier seems overwhelmed and flustered

I took my IS350 into Discount with a tire that was leaking air. I figured a nail was stuck in it.    They had me in and out of the place within 20 minutes, all tires filled up, nail removed.  Did I mention they did this all for FREE?  Its good advertising because most people would think of discount tire when they need a tire replaced.

Mill cue club is awesome!  They have great drink specials and the Bartenders and Servers are friendly and quick with drink orders (which on mill is hard to come by)  Amelie and Noel are the best servers!  Long Island Teas are cheap and 2 of them will do you in for the night!

I recently just wrote a bad review for Francis and Sons car wash because I was a regular and the service was going downhill.   I went and got a car wash at Dannys.. Never been happier.  I am used to a Glass salesman and the car wash upsell pressure... I did not get any of that with Dannys. All they asked was if I wanted to bump it up to the VIP wash, I say no and they are fine with that.  Everything else was great. A bit expensive, but they make up for it with their service.

This place is awesome!   I used to have a 2005 G35 and they took great care of it!  They know these cars so well because they all drive similar vehicles.    Pricing is spot on as well.    I have not run in to any problems with my new vehicle, but if I do, 350z Motorsports will be the ones to service it.

I have been a long time customer at this car wash with this location. I have been going there since it Changed from Weiss Guys to Diamond Car wash and now its known as Francis and Sons. It seems the service has declined for each change of ownership.   Today was the tip of the iceberg and I will not be going there again. The past 2 visits have proven to me that their customer service has rapidly declined.   I understand that every business needs to "Upsell", but it becomes an annoyance when they keep bugging me 5,6,7,8 times after I have said no. Don't even get me started on their glass repair salesmen....  I always get the Premium auto wash, a few weeks ago I went and when I got home I noticed they had not cleaned my dash or center console (which is included in premium). I also noticed they had not wiped down my tires after applying Armor All and it all splattered up to the sides of my vehicle after driving away, I wrote these off as a simple mistake and that it probably would not happen again.   Today's experience was worse. I took my truck in for a wash and I told the guy I did not have time for a hand wax (upsell) I was then pressured into buying it in advance so I could come back another day and get it waxed. No was not an answer to this guy, I had to actually walk away to leave this Pressured UPSELL.   Again, I purchased the premium wash. They called for the vehicle and I noticed that there were little black spots (mud?) all over the side of the truck. I told the guy about this and he said "its ready." I explained that it wasnt and started using my finger to poke at what was probably 20-30 little black spots all over the side, he gave me a disgusted look and told me he had to go get a clean rag. I asked for a manager.   The manager came and had the guy wipe the spots off, but did not seem to care at all and walked away before the guy wiped down half of the spots. I had already given a tip to the first guy and this guy stood there expecting a tip, I am generous with tips, but will not tip more because I had to ask them to fix their mistake.   Upon entry of my vehicle I noticed there was still some dirt on the floor and my center console armrest was not cleaned. I only took the truck in due to my dog leaving paw prints on the center armrest and hair all over the place...   I got an oil change at Danny's Car Wash at Tempe Marketplace a few weeks ago, and was so Impressed by their service and car wash service that I will make the 20 minute trip to go up there for my car wash from now on.

DO NOT BUY BOTTLE SERVICE HERE.... We called ahead and reserved a table.  They told us the table was 1 bottle minimum .  We usually get 1 bottle of grey goose and then just order drinks and shots from our server (spending just as much as a bottle).    Server was pouring EXTRA drinks without putting mixer in them and leaving them on the side of the table. Then I noticed her take one of them away as if it was an empty.   Our server was also pouring very heavy, I don't usually mind and understand the server wants the bottle to finish quicker so we buy more.   Once the bottle ran out the server told us we needed to buy another one. We said we would rather just run up a tab and buy shots, mixed drinks, etc etc.  (there was 8 of us and we would have easily ran up more money than a bottle in the same time frame of drinking a bottle).    THE SERVER TOLD US TO GET OFF THE TABLE SINCE WE ARE NOT BUYING ANOTHER BOTTLE....  This has never happened at Revolver, Smashbox, Firehouse, Axis, or American Junkie.. We said we would be running up an equal amount, she said the only way she would allow us to stay is if each of us racked up a $200 tab.    Cliffs: Server was constanting pouring extra drinks and leaving them around our table. Server booted us from table for not buying another bottle even though we were willing to run up higher $$ tab.

I love chipotle, I eat at least once a week at chipotle.  Today was my last visit to the chandler fashion center location.  An employee named Autumn was extremely unprofessional in handling a small complaint.   I was building my burrito bowl and asked for steak. Autumn was helping me get the bowl started and instead of handing the bowl off the next employee she reached over and gave me an extremely small scoop of steak. It had to have been about 6-7 cubes of steak. I voiced my concern and she rolled her eyes and put 2-3 more cubes in the bowl and told me in a very snappy tone "that's it and if you want any more you can order double"   I've been to many chipotles and ordered double steak many times, I've also never seen an employee act this way. I thought chipotle made better hiring choices.
