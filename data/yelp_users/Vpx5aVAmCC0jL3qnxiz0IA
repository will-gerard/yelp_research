Had an amazing day at the zoo!!! Little warm outside but totally worth the memories made. Took our youngest for the first time today and he absolutely loved it. It's been 6 years since we have been and we need to make a point to go more. Thank you and we will hopefully be back again soon

Second time coming to this location. We were happy once again with our dinner and the kids loved their meals. I ordered the Gorgonzola pear salad and it's was lite and refreshing and perfect the way it is. My kids got a hamburger and fries and pasta and mashed potatoes. The kids portions are really good and filled my kids up. We will for sure be coming back again

Went today for the lunch buffet I have been getting emails about. Was very disappointed by it. The salad bar is nothing like it used to be. All they have out is lettuce and 4 different dressing options. Very disappointed. Pizza also seems very poor quality. It seems they have decided to cut costs by offering this pizza and salad bar but I will never go back!!! I will go to Peter piper pizza like I usually do for the buffet and kids to play. Way better pizza and salad options there.  Also they have changed their play area, no longer having the toddler section with the little baby slide. I enjoyed that area so baby could play in a confined space and I could watch. Now it's all open and of course can't just relax and watch.

So very disappointed. Went here a week ago and it was delicious. Decided we would get Togo since we were tired from the day driving home and had baby in tow. Was told order would be ready in about 35 minutes got there in 30 and was told it still had another 20 to go. So frustrated went back to the car to wait since the inside was so hot. After 20 minutes went back and was told another 10 more minutes of course furious at this time another 15 minutes later of course baby and husband waiting in the car the entire time our one pizza comes out and says it's going to be a couple more for the other. 5 more minutes go by and the lady comes up and says they dropped our pizza on the ground. UNBELIEVABLE. So so frustrated and angry she says she will credit my acct which I will follow up with and make sure it gets done but so angry and not sure if I will be going back. Total time 70 minutes wasted when told 35 min and a quarter tank of gas. RIDICULOUS!!!!

Bought a big ice cream cake for my sons 8th bday party. Very very disappointed, ice cream tastes old and almost freezer burnt taste. Nobody enjoyed it and were were left with a ton of cake left because nobody enjoyed it. My husband which loves ice cream can't even eat it. Won't be getting any more ice cream cakes here in the future. Save the $55

Went for breakfast this morning. Was very impressed with the service and food. Got a waffle and bacon and eggs. First time a place has cooked my bacon perfect the first time. Amazing!!! Kids loved the kids meals and at the end they let you pick out a prize In The saddle bag, which my kids loved.

Love Chompies!! Have been going to the Paradise valley mall location for year. So very excited they opened one in Arrowhead mall. We have already been to this new location about 5 times and every visit is so delicious and service is amazing. Wouldn't change a single thing!!
