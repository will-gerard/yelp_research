Making the reservation was easy. We got seated right away. The ambiance was very nice on the patio. The staff was courteous and the food was delicious.

Atmosphere is always fun and the food is good as long as you stick to chicken. If you sit in the bar area try to sit in Cassie or Suzie's section; they are the best.

Food was great as always, but the service is a little lack luster. Got the wrong drinks a couple of times and the staff in general is not very courteous.

Good was amazing. Little on the pricey side, but get plenty for your buck. Service and ambiance were great too. Will definitely go back.

It was pretty remarkable. They did a great job, although make sure that you have plenty of time; its a bit overwhelming.

If I could rate this store a zero I absolutely would. Hands down the worst experience with a bridal shop I have ever encountered! DO NOT USE THEM if you value honesty and accurate results.  I ordered my bridesmaid dress on February 20th which was a Sunday, so I was instructed to call them back on Monday so that they could contact the designer for timeframes. I called on Monday and was told that the dress would not be in until the first week in May if I did not put a rush on it, so I told them that I would need the rush because the wedding is out of town on May 16th, They said they woud add to my order and that my dress would be in the first week in April.  I did not hear from them the first week in April, so I placed my first of many calls to them on 4/12. I was told that the dress had not come in yet, but that they would call the manufacturer and call me back; no one called.  I called again on 4/13 and they said that the dress would ship the following Monday and would be in by the end of the next week (4/21-22) and they would call when it came in.  I called again on 4/25 because I had not heard back YET AGAIN and they said that it didn't come over the weekend, but that it would be in the afternoon shipment and would call when they got it.  AGAIN no call back, so called again on 4/26 not in said they would call manufactuerer and call back. Nothing. Called again 4/27 spoke to Cherish - no one ever contacted the manuf. would call me back. by noon, but didn't get a call so called again and they said it was shipping, but they were not allowed to release tracking numbers, so I asked to speak to manager (Rebecca) who was "out running errands and would call me back", but never did.  This same back and forth went on until Saturday 4/30 when I finally had to have my husband take over the phone calls because they said that my dress had been delivered to a PUB in Tempe somewhere and they couldn't find it.   They finally found it that afternoon and I had the bride go get it for me for fear of what they would do with it if given the opportunity. Laughably, they still asked if I wanted to schedule and alterations appointment...FAT CHANCE!

Ate there for the first time last night and the food was fantastic. They did a great job on the remodel, so it's a lot more open than it was before. They have an extensive wine list and the service was wonderful. We will definitely go back!

Yesterday was my first time at Phoenix Glow after reading the great reviews on Yelp and I was not disappointed! Ann was great, asked lots of questions and gave a lot of good tips for lengthening my tan and achieving the color I want.   I've spray tanned before and done an airbrush tan like this once and I always come out looking like Snookie because I'm very fair, but not this time. My tan looks very natural!  Will definitely be returning!

This was my first time coming here, but it was very clean, the staff was friendly and there wasn't much of a wait. They will even fill your prescription here for a $15 copay so you don't have to go to the pharmacy.
