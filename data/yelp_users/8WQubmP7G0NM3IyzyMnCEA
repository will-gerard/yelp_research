I'm on the hated-it scale of the Honey Bear love fest.    We ordered the bbq ribs and a beef sandwich with cole slaw and cowbro beans on the side.  Thought the meal was on the below average scale for tastiness...the beef sandwich meat suffered from not being marinated, and it was bone dry...the bbq rib was more of the same...so this would have been a 2 star review...BUT what pushed it down to 1 star for me was that my ribs were "bloody"...No not pink, but actually bloody with the jelly-like texture of raw meat...great when I'm eating sushi, but not so much for bbq pork  I actually returned the bloody thing to the counter person who agreed that it was bloody and made me a new plate...unfortunately, it was a new plate of the same bloody ribs, I gave up and just trashed the bloody plate....so no, I won't be back for another try  If you're looking for tasty bbq sandwich...try TEXAZ for lunch...that's where I'd be the next time I have a craving

Awesome, super authentic Chinese soup.   Gourmet House of Hong Kong has a daily soup that's definitely a must try...but please do keep an open palate.   The soup changes to suit the season..with cooling ingredients in the summer and heating ingredients in the winter.  When I was there, they were serving a mixed root vegetables in a pork broth (note that slightly milky/cloudy color comes from lenghty boiling of pork ribs).  It was the best home made soup, I've had in a long while.    Also the beef pan fried rice noodle was excellent with just the right amount of chewiness...but not for those who are afraid of a little grease in their food. If you're feeling especially adventurous, then I'd also recommend the salt & pepper tripe (yup, that's edible offal)   Beware that not everything here is equally delicous or authentic...so unless if you're looking for panda express style Chinese (I personally do crave Panda once in while), then avoid the $5 lunch specials

The most authentic old-time soda shop experience in Phoenix.  Forget about that other place in Old Town...a mere youngster from the 50's.  Mac Alpine is the real deal.  When you want a malt, this is the place to go with 6 scoops in your cup (with extra portion in the stainless steel shaker that they also give you).  The sandwiches are so-so and the ice cream is Thrifty...but the atmosphere is genuine retro with original coke signs and wooden booth seating.   Great place to take kids or out-of-towners...and you can check out the cute antique store next door if you need to wait for a table

The real deal if you order off the menu written only in Chinese.  Authentic mostly Shanghainese food (with about a third Sichuan dishes and a sprinkling of Cantonese dishes) that I've yet to find any where else in Phoenix.  Check out the pics for my best attempt at translation of the menu, which is by no means 100% accurate so please refer to the restaurant for a detailed description.  Alex C already listed all the stuff we ordered so please refer to his review for details.  The only one he didn't really talk about is the veggie dish called Ma Lan Tou which refers to the type of Shanghainese vegetable that I've rarely seen outside of China.  It's a cold 'salad' of finely chopped said dark green leafy vegetable and firm tofu tossed in sesame oil.  A refreshing summer appetizer which great contrast of crunchiness from the vegetable and softness of the tofu.  See item (x) on the menu.

$0.99 tacos - generously sized and very tasty.  The fact that you can sit down at this price is amazing - who cares about the lack of decor.  To top, service was very friendly.     We went for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed.  Lamb's the weekend special so we order the lamb soup and the grilled lamb taco.  The shredded lamb in the taco tasted more boiled than grilled - we surmised that this was the reason for the tasty lamby soup.    We ordered a few tacos and liked the al pastor the best.  The dry-rubed spices had completely infused into the meat which combined with the smokiness of the charcoal grill made it one of the best al pastor we'd had.  Also liked the horchata - most places make it too sweet - this one was just right allowing other flavors to come through.  If you want more details, Seth has a great review with pictures on his blog "Feasting in Phoenix": http://feastinginphoenix.com/?p=223

Delicious numbingly spicy  Sichuan food.  I'm personally addicted to Sichuan red peppercorns which are not only spicy but cause your taste buds to salivate uncontrollably.  I was happy to find that it was generously used in most of the dishes I ordered.    We went for lunch and decided to stay away from the lunch menu which was a hit list of popular Americanized Chinese food.  We ordered the first appetizer on the menu which is "Husband and Wife Lung Slices" - name sounds sadistic but it's actually to do with a husband and wife team in ancient China who sold such delicious sliced lung that the dish was named after them.  Lung is rarely used any more.  At Szechwan Palace they used a combination of thinly-sliced shank marbled with tendon and strips of tripe marinated in a chili oil sauce.  The cumin wok-fried beef was generously spiced and reminded us of the BBQ skewers that Mongolian street vendors used to sell in Shanghai.  Stay away from the familiar Americanized dishes and you will be rewarded.

We've just discovered two new awesome dishes at Szechwan Palace -  the cumin covered lamb riblets on the Chinese menu as well as the Water Boiled Fish Filets on the regular menu.  The lamb riblets are coated with cumin and other spices, quick fried and then wok-fried with whole dried chilies, Szechwan numbing red peppercorns and caramelized onions.  This is a finger-lickin' tasty dish which you have to eat with your fingers unless you have amazing chopstick skills.   The Water Boiled dishes are a famous Szechwan classic which I don't know why I haven't ordered until today.  The plain name is quite misleading.  It's a clear soup boiled with an insane amount of chilies, more numbing peppercorns, Napa cabbage, a little celery, fermented beans and garnished with sprigs of coriander.  You have choice of meat and we chose fish today.  The filets are coated with cornstarch and quickfried to preserve it's moisture and tenderness before adding to the stew.  This is by far the spiciest and most flavorful dish I've had here so far.  I think I'm hooked.  Let me stress that this restaurant excels at authentic Szechwan food, not American-style Chinese dishes or even Cantonese dishes.  Although the xiao long bao (Shanghainese soup buns) were surprisingly good.  I wonder if they share some dishes with the Shanghainese restaurant on the other side of Ranch Market, which was extremely quiet in contrast to Szechwan Palace which was packed with a weekday office lunch crowd.

3 stars for the pastries - extra star for wonderful service.  From the name I thought this was a Japanese run bakery but in fact the owners are Taiwanese.  We needed a cake for a birthday and called ahead to make sure they carried fresh fruit chiffon cakes.  The owner helpfully told us that he had one mixed fruit one left but it was made yesterday.  If we wanted something made today, he had strawberry.  Such honesty is really rare.  The store is in an old shopping center across from Texaz and looks like it hasn't been renovated in a long time but is carefully maintained.  The cakes come in many sizes from 6" to 12"rounds to various sheet pan sizes.  Our 8" was less than $10.  They also sell pastries like napoleons and steamed buns with savory and sweet fillings.  We had the cake later that night at Yasu - the chiffon cake was soft and moist complimented nicely by the layers of buttercream.

No false advertising here.  Just the best damn chicken fried steak I've had in Phoenix (and BBQ beef ribs, see update).  We also got the bbq pork sandwich which was so mouth wateringly good that I wished Texaz would just go ahead and deliver a full line of bbq items...and stop teasing me with just this one tempting tasty bit  Really generous portions. The sides was just typical..but with the mains this good, I couldn't really care.   My plate was overflowing and my jeans needed loosening after the super yummy and yet easy on the wallet lunch.  Update:  We've been on the hunt for BBQ beef ribs which doesn't seem as popular as pork ribs.  It may not be as tender as pork but the flavor is what we're after.  When we heard that our favorite Texan restaurant serves it only on Tuesday nights, we had to make the trip.  We arrived after 9pm but luckily they still had one order left.   $11 for five giant beef back ribs - slow-smoked over hickory and oak, topped with a homemade BBQ sauce and served with their rustic mashed potatoes.   The dry spice-rub had so infused into the meat during the long slow cooking process that we didn't need the sauce.  Eating beef ribs is a carnivorous act - almost caveman like - if it wasn't for the fact that the server thoughtfully brought us a warm wet napkin to wipe our saucy fingers on.  Despite the tastiness of the ribs, there was just so much of it that even with the two of us sharing, we could not finish it.  It made for a tasty lunch the day after.

A carnivore's delight...virtual cornucopia of meat and more meat...most of it in sausage form of course...blood sausage, white sausage, hard-smoked sausage....this is the right place for the answer to those sausage cravings  If you go...and you should go...have your cash ready ...the German Sausage Company closes early (5pm on weekdays) and doesn't take credit cards.  You can also sample some of their sausages next door at the Black Forest Mill.

Super Dragon's main menu is filled with Americanized Chinese food which I ignored as soon as I saw the single page laminated menu in pure Chinese.  The two dishes we ordered were delicious and reminded me of food cooked at my grandma's house in Hong Kong.  The Chinese menu is filled mainly with Cantonese food except for the obligatory Peking duck.  We ordered the bitter melon stir-fried with 3 kinds of diced eggs (salted duck eggs, preserved eggs and regular eggs).  The hints of bitterness nicely balanced the creaminess of the preserved eggs and savoriness of the salted eggs.  The weather was cold so we wanted a braised dish served in a hotpot.  We ordered the mixed veg with dried shrimp and vermicelli (aka mung bean thread) in hotpot.  What came instead of the vermicelli was black moss and the addition of tofu, which was not mentioned.  We didn't mind because we really liked the dish esp the black moss which is a more expensive and rare ingredient.  The flavors were spot on, well-balanced and very comforting.  I'm guessing that food from the Chinese menu is so rarely ordered that the kitchen confused what I ordered with another vegetarian dish on that menu.  I need to find out the name so that I can order it again.  It's a shame that Super Dragon doesn't offer the authentic Chinese menu in English as well.

Solid neighborhood place serving good old school Chinese food in generous portions and with a surprisingly high level of service.  Here it's all about the Mu Shu and the sizzling platters.  Flamingo Palace still provides old fashion table side service where the waitress plates the black pepper beef onto the hot cast iron platter right next you so you can see the steam and hear the dish sizzle.  The mu shu is also wrapped table side.  Don't let the obscure corner location deter you.  The interior is much nicer (though a little worn) than the outside might suggest.  Extra star for the service.

Petsmart's PetsHotel is a life saver for all those times when your doggie just can't come along on an out of town trip...affordable overnight care with enough amenities to assuage my guilty conscience.  This joint is nicer than some of the value places that I've been to.  There's a dog theme lobby for checking in.  "Elli" gets her own room with her own bed, blanket and toys.  Additional walks and play times are available as add-on services.    7am check-in means we can get an early start heading out of town.  When we pick her up, there is a report card telling us how well (or not so well) she did with playing, eating and pooping.  An extra plus is that we can schedule an exit bath or a full-on grooming session (also extra fees for these) on check-out day so that Elli is sweet smelling when we get her home again.

This bare- bone market is a tiny slice of Eastern Europe in Phoenix.  Does your grocery list beg for an assortment of smoked fishes and/or canned pate (from turkey to pork)?  This is also where you can go when only Hungarian paprika will do.  Also have fun selection of chocolate and candy.

After an awesome experience with Lo-lo's, I thought I'd expand my horizon by trying out other soul food places in the area.  Bobby C's seem like a cool bar....but unfortunately, it wasn't so cool a place for dinner.    We ordered fried catfish, fried chicken and country fried steak.  They came with sides of dirty rice, corn bread, green beans, collard greens and mac & cheese.  All the fried stuff were decently crispy, but somewhat unseasoned and not particularly memorable.    The sides stood out more...but not in a good way.Rarely do I wish that a restaurant would use Kraft's blue box for the Mac & Cheese, but in this case it would have been an improvement.  The "fresh" green beans has the distinct taste of a tin can.  Corn muffin was dry.    It'll be hard to get me to stray from Lo-lo again

4 stars for roasted meats.  Stars deducted for poor attitude from owner.  Good Chinese roast meats and authentic Cantonese cooking in a former Thai buffet restaurant space.  I was excited to see Roast Duck "Lai Fun" Noodle Soup but was disappointed when the lai fun turned out to be more like udon.  Lai fun is the classic noodle accompaniment to roasted goose in Hong Kong.  It's silky and delicate - this one was thick and heavy.    When I protested to the server, she passed me on to the owner who said this is what lai fun is like in the US.  I was outraged - how can you  use this as an excuse especially when the dish was advertised in Chinese only?  Obviously whoever could read it would know what it's supposed to be like.  You don't pass off fettucine for spaghetti just cuz you're in another country!  I hate how people like this give Chinese service a bad rap.

Great place to pick up fresh local produce if you've missed the farmers' markets.  This place is open daily.  They also sell delicious homemade kettle corn and Peet's coffee beans.  We picked up some tomatoes and organic local lettuces to go with the bacon we bought at the Pork Shop.  Together they made a killer BLT.

After reading all the reviews here about C-Fu Gourmet being the best place for dim sum in the valley, I am really disappointed to be writing my first 1 star review for the area  Was the service rude and uncaring? The answer here is yes.  Especially the way that push-cart servers call out the food which make you feel like you're in a rowdy tourist market full of cheap knock-offs they're trying to get rid of.    But all would have been forgiven if only the dim-sum being served was any good.  However the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the food.   Dishes that made me ashamed to be Chinese (yes, the level that C-Fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad):  -  Fried glutinous rice:  The preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was MIA. We complained to one of the waiters who replied that "they probably forgot" (um are you sure it's not cost cutting for those who don't know any better?).  More over, the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time (except of course everything is being done in a wok)...Here the C-Fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil.     -  Glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf:  Once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf.  Just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leaf.  Dishes I was amazed by (and no not in a good way):  -  Deep fried taro dumpling:  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil  -  Steamed bok choy:  How the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable?  C-Fu managed to accomplish this amazing feat of greasy steamed vegetable...unbelievable  On a good note, the Siu Mai was decent.  We did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop up...but nope that was it,...so if  you must go to C-Fu for dim-sum...just order order a lot of siu mai and be careful of all the other dishes.  Dinner here was much better. 1 star is for dim-sum only.  Next time I have a dim-sum craving, you'll be finding me across the valley at China Chan's (Glendale) where the short & sweet dimsum offering is cooked by a man who doesn't cut corners and it shows.  That's where I'll be sticking to from now on.

Lee Lee is like Disneyland for foodie. Whenever I'm there, I discover some new interesting ingredients...not just Asian ones since they carry ingredients from all corners of the earth.  My motto for Lee Lee is buy first, then look it up on the web.  Amazing way to expand your palate...though I must admit that sometime my palate doesn't stand up quite so well to my adventurous spirit.  Lee Lee (particularly the live seafood and meat counter) is not for the faint-hearted nor for those pressed for time as they have their own unique way of labeling the aisles by country....so if you're looking for soy sauce, then it would be in the soy sauce aisle as well as in the Japan aisle and the Korean aisle depending on what brand you're looking for and where they're made...and some origin labeling can really make you wonder what they were smoking...for example, ketchup was in the African-Caribbeans aisles  Go there when you've got a free afternoon...my latest treasure hunt at Lee Lee yielded real dulce de leche from Argentina.  Good luck hunting!

When we found out that Matt's Big Breakfast gets their thick-cut bacon and breakfast sausages from The Pork Shop, we decided to check it out.  It was opened in 1979 by a long time hog farmer.  They brown sugar cure and hickory smoke their bacon and hams in their own smoke house.  Just as Alex said, this place sells pork in every cut and possible form.      We bought the peppered bacon, jalapeno bologna, russian salami (contains caraway seeds), capicola (sliced thin and recommended by owner to be eaten like proscuitto) and a hamhock.  They'll cut you a slice of any cured meat to taste before buying.  We also got a 1lb of free bratwurst with a coupon we picked up at Queen Creek Olive Mill.  If you want something hot to eat right there, they have green chile burros and pulled pork with beans.  The only seating is outdoors.  We dropped by the Guadalupe Farmers' Market on the way home and bought some tomatoes and local lettuces.  Together with the lemon pugliese we bought from Bread & Cie in San Diego, we made the best BLT ever.  The bacon rocked!

Kristin's review was so compelling that I had to check out NYBnB.  I too miss the smell of yeasty dough being baked while strolling through NY's Upper Westside.  There's a sign on Shea but otherwise the store's not visible from the street.  We drove under the arches of Agua Caliente Shopping Center and eventually found NYBnB on the right.  We were surprised by how big the place was.  We ordered an Everything bagel toasted with cream cheese ($2.39) and agree with Kristin that it would've been better more toasted.  I also prefer mine chewier.  They were more than generous with the cream cheese.  I wish you could pay only for the amount of cream cheese you want.   On our way out, we bought a half-dozen bag of mini bagels and learned that bialys are, unlike bagels, not boiled so the texture's lighter and lower in calories.    To me, a good crusty, chewy bagel's worth the calories!

The restaurant is hidden away in the corner of a busy strip mall near Chompie's.  Happy hour is Sun-Thu 5pm-6pm, when all sushi (non-market priced nigiris not makis) on the menu are 50% off.  Most items are $4-$5.  The highest price item is amaebi (raw sweet shrimp) $7, which was huge and very fresh.  The head is served deepfried which is better than any french fry.  I also like the oysters with ponzu sauce.

Excellent galbi - grilled marinated short ribs.  We happened to be in the area around dinner time and decided to check it out.  As we parked our car, a whole Korean family walked out of Seoul Jung.  This was a good sign.  We ordered the "Dol Sot Bibim-Bob" $10.90 and the only special to be found on the menu: #13. "Galbi & your choice of Naeng Myun" $13.90.  Soon after, the waiter brought over a multitude of banchan, including the standard bean sprouts, spinach and various kim chees.  All were pretty much as expected.    We chose the non-spicy Naeng Myun, which is a giant bowl of chewy buckwheat noodles in an iced tangy beef broth with julienned veg and slices of Korean pear (the spicy version comes without soup).  We were first introduced to this dish at Hodori in LA's K-town by a Korean friend and ever since we've been hooked.  It's one of the most refreshing dishes - it cuts right through the heaviness of Galbi.  The Galbi came to the table sizzling on a hot plate.  The generous pile of short ribs were tender and well-marinated - obviously from a very good cut.    The two of us were pretty full when the Bibimbab arrived.  We waited a few minutes for the rice to get crispy along the sides of the hot stone pot (dol sot) before squeezing in the spicy bean paste and mixing up the contents - shredded veg, beef and raw egg.    Despite our level of satiation, we still enjoyed it.  To cleanse our palates, the server brought us each a complimentary bowl of sikhye (sweet rice soup) as is custom.  Korean food's all about the complimentary stuff - you can get unlimited refills of banchan.  We probably would have walked out happy with just the special but thought we should at least order a dish each.  Room's a bit dated and the service is friendly.  I think Mr K should give Seoul Jung another try at dinner.

Unexpectedly delightful ice cream in a strip mall location (like just about all my good finds in Phoenix).   Honestly, I was just looking for a quick break and much needed sugar on the drive back from (sleep deprived) days in Vegas...what I found was one of the best ice cream I've had in Phoenix.  This little independent gem does it all...ice cream, gelato, mix-ins...and Karen was amazingly friendly and overwhelmingly generous with all her samples.  I was told that she makes everything herself on site.  Everything I tried was super tasty...but the one flavor that can get me in my car and back to Surprise would be Red Velvet.  Pricing is a bit different here...you pay for ice cream by the weight rather than by the scoop...great for me since I really do prefer little scoops....lots and lots of little scoops

Just gotta add my 2 cents on the awesomeness that is Ichiza.  It's like tapas on steroid for extra tastiness.  The menu was so much fun and the varieties of little plates kept us going for 3 days straight before we could even contemplate dinner elsewhere.    Definitely should order off the regular menu and try the dishes pasted on the walls...in fact if you got a craving for any particular dish, you should just go ahead and ask the waitress if they had it...we were pleasantly surprised with yellowtail collar which wasn't on the menu nor on the wall.  Everything I had range from pretty good (takoyaki) to totally awesome (beef tongue skewer)...and the bill was than reasonable...many bangs for my bucks

We went for dinner the first night of CES (probably one of the biggest shows in Vegas).  Every restaurant in the area was packed, including Emperor's Garden.  We had to wait about 15min for our table.  When we got our menu, we were surprised by the care the owner took to explain the background of the cuisine as well as origins of well-known dishes.  We were intrigued by the story of the Husband and Wife Beef Lung Slices (lung has been replaced by shank and tendon in modern times) so ordered that.  It came in a deceivingly spicy red chili oil, which was just mildly hot and had a complex fermented flavor which we really liked.  There was great contrast in texture between the tender shank and crunchy tendon.  I've been on a hunt for authentic Dan Dan noodles, which I was excited to find here.  This one was perfectly spiced with lots of ground Sichuan red peppercorns that linger on your tongue making it salivate.  This stuff is addictive if you like the sensation - I do.  The mini pork dumplings had silky smooth delicate skins which helped take away the spice of the other dishes.  The fish filets in Hunan sauce were super tasty with just the right amount of spiciness - enough to not overwhelm the other flavors.    The string beans were fried perfectly without any hint of greasiness and well seasoned, reminding me of good french fries.  A native Sichuan customer we met gave it a 7 out of 10, which is pretty good for this side of the Pacific.  I've got to make a trip to Chengdu to find the 10/10 restaurant he's talking about.

I wouldn't have been able to find Lo-Lo's without GPS...but now that I have, I'll definitely be going back.  The southern fried chicken was crunchy, tasty, finger lickin' good (take that KFC)...and the thin buttery waffle also had a nice crisp edge, although next time I'm gonna try for extra crispy waffles...the mac & cheese was velvety smooth & rich...my first bite of rice & beans was an epiphany - the savory sauce was a perfect contrast against the sweetness of the waffles and crusty corn muffin - I now know that I have never truly had rice and beans before Lo-Lo's.  But my favorite was actually the fried catfish...dusted with cornmeal for a dry (not oily) crunch into oh-so tender flaky catfish.  I would have loved to order another one, but I was bursting.  However, as I went up to pay, I could not help but notice that luscious hunk of Red Velvet cake slathered with cream cheese frosting and studded with walnut...I gave into the siren call and ordered a piece to take home.  Unfortunately, the cake turned out to be a bit of a letdown despite being plenty moist - no taste of chocolate to be found and the icing was a tad thin.  The other thing I didn't like was the coffee, which was kind of watery...but hey that's kinda authentic too.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.  When we told her that our eggs still had not hit the table even though we were almost done with the rest of the food, she offered us a choice of any side to take home.   This kind of service is rare and is also why I want to go back.

When we asked some local Mexican friends where to go for authentic Mexican food and, in particular, mole, they unanimously recommended Pepe's.  Howard Seftel's AZ Republic review also recommended the chicken enchiladas with mole.  We went for lunch on a Sunday and fortunately did not witness any "deals" going down.  The restaurant's in a stand-alone building with ample parking.  It's spacious inside with high-backed wooden booths and a long bar.  We ordered: - Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole:  3 flour tortillas wrapped around shredded chicken breast, covered with black mole and cheese, served with refried beans and rice  - Tacos Rancheros:  mildly spicy slow-braised pork in choice of soft or crispy taco  The verdict: - The mole sauce was a delicious combination of spices and chocolate - we wished there could've been more.  I actually prefer dark meat so next time I'll order the Mole Poblano, where they give you choice of chicken leg or breast.   - Described as a house specialty, the pork was tender and infused with spices.  According to a review posted on the wall, chopped chorizo is also mixed in.   Dishes on average run between $8 to $10.  We're eager to go back to try the green corn tamales, taco monterrey (machado (sun-dried beef) w/ scrambled eggs) and of course, more mole!

3/16 Update:  I've decided to remove two stars from my rating because my recent visits have just been disappointing.  The grilled pork is more baked than grilled - no smokiness or tasty charred bits anywhere.  The pho tastes more of MSG than boiled beef bones.  And service is as bad as ever.  I wonder if Da Vang's popularity has led it to take shortcuts for efficiency.    Definitely not worth going out of your way for - go to Khai Hoan in Tempe for the smokey grilled pork or Saigon Nites in Scottsdale for the delicious pho instead.  Prior review:  Essential pre-eating check list for Da Vang  1.   Turn your expectation on service down to zero 2.   Voluntary separation of  restaurant decor & atmosphere from the dining experience 3.  Limited peripheral vision is a plus  Now you're ready to enjoy one of the tastiest Vietnamese place this side of San Jose.

This is the most progressive, inclusive, welcoming, diverse, intellectually stimulating, public-service oriented church in the Valley, if not the West Coast.  We've been to more than a few and can attest to that.    Pastor Jeff not only knows everyone's name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life.  The congregation is like one big family.  Love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church - it's acted upon.    If you're sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and don't act what they preach, you'd better check this one out.  Services every Sunday at 9:30am.

After having eaten at Golden Buddha, China King, C-Fu, and China Chan, I have to say that Great Wall is probably the best place to get dimsum in the Valley.   China Chan comes a close second with better har gau and egg tarts.  The Chinese New Year special dimsum - pig trotters with black moss - was delicious.  Apparently it's super labor intensive so is only offered for a limited time.  The shiu mai, steamed tripe and spare ribs were cooked and seasoned just right.  The taro puff had great taro flavor and tasty filling with only a hint of oil.  The har gau skin unfortunately fell apart and the egg tart crust was not as flaky as China Chan's.  Overall, the flavors were good, fresh and a nice variety to choose from.

When Jason W heard that I was in search of a bar stool, while on limited budget and time, he immediately pointed me to Copenhagen Clearance.  Bingo, within minutes I found what I needed and, best of all, at half price.  According to the staff, they're selling most items at half price - another sign of the times...

Unexpectedly well stocked Korean market.  Ignore the boarded up look on the outside and you'll walk in to an oasis of hard to find Korean ingredients.   There was an entire cold case worth of various Naeng Myon (cold buckwheat noodles) -- refrigerated or frozen straight from Korea - perfect for the hot Phoenix weather.  Condiments are taken very seriously here.  Wide range of sesame and chili oil. Also, I didn't know know that vinegar comes in flavors like persimmons, black vinegar honey, etc.  The household aisle was full of fun goodies for foodies.  Stone pots, steamers and best of all made-in-Japan Benriner (Japanese mandoline) for just $20.    Note that the emphasis here is on imported stuff from Korea so there is only a tiny selection of fresh vegs, and no eggs or dairy product that I can see.

家在陝西 (literally: Home in Shaanxi) New ownership since 7/1/15. Ignore all prior photos, reviews and please do not come here for American Chinese food esp egg rolls.  New owners kept the English name to probably save time & money but can be very misleading to those who don't read Chinese.  This is legit Northern Chinese food so do some research before coming otherwise it can be overwhelming. Servers speak limited English so don't expect too much help from them. Check out my photos for ideas.  Go with a group if possible. Portions are generous especially #17-#19: ma-la spicy chicken, shrimp with smoky roasted chiles and spicy fish stew - all spectacular dishes worthy for celebrations. Food can be quite spicy but is very well balanced and expertly executed. It can get packed during peak hours so try going off hours but not during their 2:30-4:30 break. BBQ is only served after 4:30.

New ownership since 7/1/15. Ignore all previous photos, reviews and anyone trying to get egg rolls for takeout.  This is legit Northern Chinese food so do some research before coming otherwise it can be overwhelming. Check out my photos for ideas.  Food is not overly spicy, very well balanced, with great use of acid, expertly executed, big portions for an extremely fair price. Some servers speak limited English so do your research before going.  It can get packed during peak hours so try going off hours but not during their 2:30-4:30 break. BBQ is only served after 4:30. There are a few noodle dishes under Restaurant Dishes that use gluten free bean thread (42, 58, 60). Vegetarians can request most of the noodle dishes to be made without meat or choose from the following: 6-10, 12, 14, 15, 26, 38, 40, 41, 51, 52, 55, 56, 62, 63. Please double check with server to make sure there's no meat.

5 stars for the RF happy hour!  Given the high quality of food and service at these prices, this must be  the best bargain in town!   We came on a recommendation by a trusted friend who told us we had to order the Green Chile Pork Stew ($7).  It came in a small iron kettle that kept the pork nice and hot.  We were not disappointed - the pork was tender and succulent infused with layers of spicy flavors.   We also ordered the Fondue Pot ($9) which came with three 1-oz lamb chops, butternut squash and green apples for dunking.  The cheese in the fondue tasted like a mild blend of cheddar and other American cheeses.  The lamb chops were delicious on their own but just a touch over cooked at medium-well.  The contrast of textures between the roasted squash and green apple cubes were great with the cheese.  At the start of the meal, we also ordered the Field Green salad which came with candied pecans, sliced apples, diced beets and warm crusted round of goat cheese.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the plate split for us even though it was only a $5 dish.  The service was great - our water glasses were never less than half empty and our plates were quickly changed.  Happy hour wines are only $5 a glass.  I ordered a red Zinfandel and it was good to see the proper glass brought to me along with a small carafe of wine, allowing for the right pour to facilitate lots of swirling.  It's these small details that sets a restaurant apart.  I don't remember the last time I had this quality of a meal and service for less than $30.  We will most definitely be back and often.

One word - eclectic.  The House of Rice carries predominantly Japanese foodstuffs and cookware but also has a strong showing in the Indonesian and oddly Dutch categories.  Apparently the store started as mainly Japanese and then they added more Indonesian food.  The customers looking for Indonesian ingredients demanded more Dutch ingredients so the House of Rice responded to their requests.  Now not only are there all kinds of Dutch biscuits, there are also an assortment of clog magnets and other decorative knick knacks.   I totally forgot how Indonesia used to a Dutch colony.  Somehow the Vietnamese baguette sandwiches are a stronger reminder of France's colonialism.  Forgive the digression.  Anyway, we ended up spending over $50 on a cast iron pan and ingredients for making takoyaki (octopus balls) - our favorite Japanese street snack, which we have not been able to find in Phoenix.  Those takoyaki better be darn tasty.

Sometime it's not about the food...when you're all about hanging out with a couple of good friends and enjoying the balmy Phoenix evening...then this is where Frank & Lupe shines  We had enchilada, chicken in mole sauce, fish tacos and beef flautas...nothing really stood out as being particularly good or bad...and the wait staff was somewhat lackadaisical in their attention to service...but washing it all down with pitchers of ice cold margarita was a more than pleasant way to end our Monday  So just 2.5 stars for the food, but we'd be back for more good times on the outdoor back patio.

Is it possible to get tasty Vietnamese at a place where you don't have to turn a blind eye to the unwanted glimpses of the kitchen?  Yes, indeed.  While not a stunning polished restaurant by any stretch of the imagination, Khai Hoan is an impeccably clean little family place cooking simple good food in a strip mall on Apache Blvd.   The selections are tasty, plentiful and cheap with apps ranging from $3-$6 and Mains running from $6-$7.    I enjoyed the usual Vietnamese favorites of spring rolls and pho.  While the grilled pork on broken rice was nicely flavored, the meat was a touch on the dry side.    My favorite is the pickled papaya with charcoal grilled pork and meatball.  It's served with rice noodles, lettuce and fresh herbs.  The charred savory meat is nicely balanced by the sweet and sour papaya.  The rice noodles are great for absorbing the tasty broth.  But don't go here on a lazy Sunday...you'll be sorely disappointed since the place will be closed.  Don't forget to pick up some baklava from Haji-Baba (in the same center) for dessert.

I never thought it was possible to get CRS (Chinese restaurant syndrome) at a vegetarian restaurant.  I can't believe I brought my family including one vegan visiting from LA to Green.  There was no skill or sense in the balance of flavors in any of the dishes.  Obviously whoever made the food does not eat it themselves.  All the dishes were overwhemingly drenched in sauce assaulting the taste buds with either saltiness or sourness.    The wings were incredibly sour and then when you dip them into the ranch sauce it becomes unbearably salty as well.  Thank goodness for the celery sticks.    The salad contained hardly any figs which we really had to dig for to find two small pieces.  And the balsamic was really sour.  In smaller amounts it would probably have tasted fine.  The apricot miso bowl was really sour again.  And for a vegetarian restaurant, it would've been nice to see more vegetables.  We wish all the sauces came on the side so that we could actually have tasted the other components of the dishes.   The Texas portabello po-boy was also over-sauced.  The only redeeming part of it was the tahini coleslaw.  That was nice and crunchy and properly seasoned.  It seems to me that the chef needs to check in on the kitchen or taste his food more often.

We've been twice in the past month and think it's well worth the wait.  There's only one Chris Bianco and he can't make the pizza any faster without compromising quality - crusty complex dough and generous tasty toppings.   We've worked out a system.  There's two of us and we try to go early in the week before 7pm.  We leave our name and get the usual "it'll be 1.5 to 2 hours but check back in 40min."  Make sure to call back exactly in 40min - we almost lost our place when we called back 10min late.  Plan something to do during your wait - bring reading, go shopping nearby, whatever.  Both times, we lucked out and got seated in less than one hour.  Make sure to get an extra pizza - tastes just as good the next day - 5 min in a 500 degree oven.

It was a bright and shinny afternoon when I strolled into the darken cavern that is Richardson's for an early dinner.   With only 1 other table occupied, the waitress staunchly refused to seat me until my entire party arrives --- in this case, the 2 other people that would double the current occupancy level of the restaurant.    I am getting an inkling that this may not be the pleasant dinning experience that I was hoping for.  After 10 minutes of cooling my heels on the hot asphalt lot, my wayward friends arrived and we were granted permission to sit.    The menu had odd notes of randomness...Chicken Cordon Bleu...really?  We ended up ordering New Mexico Sausages, Carne Asovada and the Relleno Platter.  The sausages were the best of the lot.  While the relleno was decent, it wasn't anything worth walking the hot parking lot for.  As for the Carne Asovada, the flavoring was so subtle that we couldn't actually taste any...ended up asking for chile sauce.  It took some effort to flag down the waitress since the occupancy level doubled yet again (meaning there is now ~ 10 customers in the restaurant)...but finally, the waitress got us 2 house-made sauces in tiny bowls.  The sauces were okay and did improve the flavor the pork (especially since it was completely bland before)...but any remaining iota of good will from this better-late-than-never gesture was completely banished when we got the bill and realized that we were charged for each of these 2 additional sauces.       Did the so-call cool quotient or the slightly above average food made up for the service?  I don't think so.  But hey if you're feeling masochistic and want to pay to be treated badly then head on over to Richardson.    Would have given 3 stars for the food alone.

This is the best Mexican meal we've had in Phoenix.  - Molotes Poblano (spicy):  3 crispy masa patties stuffed generously with chorizo and potato with roasted tomato and a big heap of their popular guacamole   - Green Corn Tamales:  2 moist and light tamales filled with a subtly sweet corn filling  - Blue Crab Enchiladas: lots of crab with perfectly sauteed squashes and black beans  There was no charge for the large basket of perfectly fried chips and spicy salsa.  Service was super helpful and friendly.  The patio was made even more enjoyable by the cool evening breezes.

4-stars for value.  Great place to fill up on cheap, tasty sandwiches before or after shopping at Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket.  Menu offers: - European sandwiches - Asian sandwiches - Gourmet coffee - Smoothies, Asian iced drinks and Italian sodas - Housemade ice cream  We've never had the urge to order the European sandwich.  The Asian one's all come with pickled shredded daikon and carrots, sliced onions, jalapeno, cilantro, mayo mixed with soy sauce on a crusty house-baked 10inch baguette.    Tip: If you're not eating it right away, ask for veggies on the side - otherwise the whole thing gets soggy.  This way it still tastes good the next day after toasting.  Plus they always give you more this way.  Our standard picks are:  #1. Lee's Combination Sandwich $2.20 - ham, headcheese (offcuts from the head of a pig/calf rolled in gelatin) and pate - great contrast of textures and flavors between the 3 kinds of meat: crunchy headcheese vs soft pate (I can just picture some of you wincing.)  # 5. Grilled Pork Sandwich $2.20 - Grilled Vietnamese-style vs Chinese BBQ (#6), which we don't like as much because it's too sweet - we prefer savory with just a hint of sweetness and the charred smokiness from the grill  Cafe Sua Da $2.20  - Vietnamese drip coffee with crushed ice - Lee's signature drink which they also make into ice cream - As much caffeine as a quadruple shot  Too bad this is the only one in Arizona.  There are almost 30 in California.  Props to the owners - this is the most well-run Asian fastfood chain on the West Coast or maybe the US.  Evidence of their success is in the ridiculously large shiny space, huge baguette machine and expensive bathroom fixtures.  Fastfood never looked this good.  Remember cash only.

3 stars for food and ambience.  Minus 1 star for service.  Cibo is the average answer to Pizzeria Bianco.  I can't believe they've even been compared  - the only similarity I can think of is geography.  The crusts are worlds apart - at least on the night we went.   We chose to take some out of town guests to Cibo last night because of: (1) all the praises we read on Yelp and other media (2) the fact that it's one of the few well-regarded independent places open on a Monday night (3) it looked cute from the outside  Apparently, other people thought the same.  All the tables for four were full inside so we took a table in the patio, which turned out to be a blessing because we got lots of privacy to talk.    The downside though was getting the attention of the waiter.  Ice water was poured and menus were handed out as soon as we sat down but the waiter appeared over 15 min later.  When we ordered a refill on a glass of wine after the appetizer, he came with it almost at the end of our meal.  We order the antipasto speciale, large ($17) to share.  The plate was huge:  generous slices of prosciutto, 3 slices of bresaola with shaved pecorino on arugula, 4 slices of grilled zucchini,  mounds of balsamic pearl onions, giant olives, grilled red peppers with capers and parmesan, and cherry tomatoes with bocconcini and basil.  Pizzas are split between Rosse (red) and Bianche (white).  On the waiter's recommendation, we ordered these:  - Red: Diavola (tomato sauce, mozz and spicy salame)  $13 - White: Siena (grilled zucchini, mozz, speck (smoked proscuitto) and pecorino)  $14  VERDICT: Cibo vs Pizzeria Bianco  The toppings were generous and tasty but the major complaint we had was the CRUST.  Pizza's all about the crust.  This was more like charred bread - it was not crusty in the least bit.  The dough had a nice chew to it but no crunch whatsoever.    Chris Bianco's dough is so brilliant because there's an awesome contrast between the crusty exterior and the pillowy interior.  Chris' crust is so thin that you can inhale slice after slice but here we had trouble eating more than 2 slices.    Even though this pizza was baked in a brick oven, there was no smokiness to it - almost as if it was flash-baked.  Pizzeria Bianco's crust not only has texture but a complex-flavored interior and smoky exterior.  Eating pizza will never be the same again...  WINNER:  Pizzeria Bianco

$48 bargain prix fixe menu at a One Michelin Star restaurant (avoid Caesar Salad).  I was surprised when we were seated out in the patio without being asked.  It was a bit too chilly if you weren't under a heater and if you were under the heater, it felt like your forehead was being scorched.  The only plus side of sitting outside is that you get a good view of the light/water show but I prefer comfortable temperatures and food that does not get cold after a minute on the table.  We requested to be reseated inside which was quickly accommodated.  The three of us each ordered one of the 3 options from each course of the $48 prix fixe menu (available before 7pm):  PUMPKIN SOUP  huckleberry coulis, spiced marshmallow or CAESAR SALAD heart of romaine, avocado, parmesan or PT DE CAMPAGNE FORESTIRE homemade pickles, country bread  SCOTTISH SALMON delicata squash, black trumpet mushroom, tarragon or THE ORIGINAL NY DB BURGER 9-oz. sirloin burger stuffed with braised short ribs, foie gras, black truffle, parmesan bun, french fries or DUO OF ORGANIC CHICKEN braised haricot vert, southern grits, natural jus  WARM PEAR CLAFOUTIS spiced orange marmalade, almond ice cream or CHOCOLATE HAZELNUT FONDANT nougatine crunch, coffee ice cream or SELECTION OF SEASONAL ICE CREAMS OR SORBET  VERDICT:  Appetizers: Pumpkin soup was my favorite - silky smooth, nice contrast of flavors and textures.  Pate was solid and presented beautifully with an array of pickled vegetables.  Caesar salad was boring and overly sweet - containing none of the characteristics of a good Caesar salad like garlic and anchovy - and way too much croutons.  Main: DB Burger was a letdown - lacking flavor and on the dry side.  The fries were the best part - seasoned with fresh herbs and garlic.  The chicken stood out, especially the breast which was probably cooked sous vide so that all of it's own natural flavor and moisture was retained.  The salmon was solidly executed.  Dessert: Coconut and mango sorbets had strong flavors and smooth mouthfeel.  Fondant was dense and intensely chocolatey.  Pear clafoutis was brought hot from the oven.  The sweet pear made the dish too sweet.  A tart fruit like raspberries or cherries would have given the dish a better balance.  http://www.danielnyc.com/dbbrasserie/_pdf/menu.pdf

I think Matt's genius is knowing where to get good ingredients and not messing it up.  I was blown away by the peppered bacon and the rosemary home fries. The waffle was good, but didn't reach the amazing wonder that was the bacon.  But if you're planning for a weekend pilgrimage then prepare yourself well for a super duper long wait, followed by quick rush out of the tiny diner space as soon as you're done with your food.     If you want a nice leisurely brunch then go some place with more seating, or you can take the drive down to Queen Creek and stock up on that incredibly delicious pepper bacon from the Pork Shop.

Chef James Porter is a great inspiration in the way he is dedicated to using quality local ingredients at Tapino.  To top it off, his kitchen masterfully executes the cooking to bring out the best in each ingredient.  Even something as simple as french fries was super addictive with the creative use of Indian spices, delicious aioli and most important of all not-your-average potatoes that tasted extra potatoey.   Happy hour is served everyday 5pm-7pm and even though the price of everything else has gone up (as a small food biz owner I know all too well), small plates and wines are still only $5.  I have no idea how he makes any money at these prices.   The portions were perfect for the two of us and we order 4 plates (corndog, carpaccio, duck confit tacos and clams) plus the fries.  Outdoor seating is beautiful and relaxing.  Service was friendly and professional.  I've already planned my next meal here - the white truffle dinner on Nov 12th which is only $125 for five courses with wines paired.  There's no way you can get that low a price for that kind of a menu in LA, SF or NY.  We're talking lobster pot pie, pork belly sous vide, veal and even truffle in the dessert.   Boy do I love living in this city when we have restaurants like Tapino.  By supporting restaurants like this, we are also supporting local producers which keeps much needed dollars in this state.  Forgive me if I sound like a politician - must be all the debates...

Does Arlecchino have the best gelato in Phoenix?  Yes, undoubtedly.  Especially love the chocolate and coffee flavors which are particularly intense.  I'm all for small independent places, but wish that Arlecchino  would be a bit more generous in the way they treat customers -  extra surcharge for the pistachio is kinda cheesy...will they be looking to give me back a quarter if I pick a flavor with non-imported ingredients? -  limiting people to only 2 tasting takes away from that friendly feeling

Had lunch here on a weekend when we didn't want to wait for a table at Morning Glory.  This is definitely "slow" food so be warned.  Luckily the outdoor seating was beautiful but a bread basket definitely would've helped calm our rumbling stomachs.  Farm burger ($14) was one of the best burgers I've had in the Valley - flavorful beef patty with a moist tender interior.  Braised short rib sandwich was a bit bland by comparison.  Locally grown garden veg crudite ($14) was fresh and full of crunchy healthy goodness.

The owners of Unlimited Coffee are intent on providing high quality coffee and homemade gelato, while having a bit of fun at the same time.  However, it seems they ran out of money for the furniture and decor.  I suppose I could take off one star for the plastic white patio chairs but I've never cared much for decor as long as the food and service is good.  Using premium beans from local roastery Aeropagus and a top-of-the-line $10k+ espresso machine, Unlimited Coffee makes wonderfully intense yet smooth coffee without the bitterness and acidity of that chain which we shall not name.    They also offer an awesome variety of not-your-everyday loose leaf teas, such as "To Die For Chai" and "My Blue Heaven."  Unlimited also makes their own gelato from scratch under the name Monster's Gelato.  Their gleaming machines from Italy are clearly visible behind the huge gelato case.  They offer a large selection of creative flavors, including Sedona Red Rock Chocolate and Exotic Wedding Cake.  Service is very friendly.  It feels like the coffee house version of Cheers.  Skip the coffee chains and support this independent coffee house!

More cafe than bakery, the short and sweet lunch offerings at Essence is spot on.  For the inner carnivore, there's a Warm Open Face Steak Sandwich made with grass fed beef...and a small side of organic greens, just enough to make you feel like you did your bit for a balanced diet.  If you're dining with a vegetarian...there's the Organic Greens, Blue Cheese & Pears...a mini sandwich of Maytag blue on the side  Great ingredients, tasty food, and easy on the wallet to boot.  I'd definitely be coming back for more.

If you're the type that are into choices, then Gelato 64 has got your number.  Their number stands for the 64 flavors of gelato that you can choose from.  When I was there they seem to be a couple of flavor short since several of the slot in the gelato case was empty...but anything approaching 60 is already a ridiculously wide range of selection.  The gelato was well flavored and had a nice smooth texture.  Extra star for range of flavor.

I agree with the other reviews, Yasu serves some of the best Japanese food in Phoenix.  The formula of fresh high quality ingredients, authentic preparation, artful presentation, modern yet unpretentious decor, friendly service and reasonable prices is destined for success.  Having spoiled my taste buds in Tokyo eating sushi every week for 5 months at Tsukiji, the world's biggest fish market, it's been hard to find satisfying sushi, especially in Phoenix.    I was delighted to see fishes imported from Japan on the menu, like spanish mackerel (aji) which I've seen only at the best sushi restaurants.  We order it as sashimi - the slices were presented next to the bones of the fish (head to tail intact) with ginger and chopped green onions.  The fish was fresh and full of flavor.    After we finished the dish, the waiter took the bones back to be deep-fried.  This is as authentic as it gets - the Japanese waste nothing.  If you can get past your squirmishness of eating fish brains, this is the ultimate crunchy treat.  Unfortunately, ankimo (monkfish liver) - one of my favorite raw dishes - creamy without being fishy served traditionally with ponzu sauce - was out that day.  We had the succulent kumamoto oysters, which were also served with ponzu, instead.  The grilled yellowtail (hamachi) filet and collar (hamachi kama) were both perfect - grilled patiently over oak charcoals until the exterior was wonderfully crispy while the interior stayed deliciously moist.  I generally prefer hamachi kama because it's oiler and more tender but the presentation of the filet was quite dramatic - long plate with fried root chips on one end and ponzu sauce with grated radish on the other.    Grilling like this does take time so be prepared to wait 20-30 min for this dish.  Quicker grilled dishes include the giant scallops wrapped in bacon and tasty lamb chops.  We also ordered the beef tongue but somehow the waiter never entered it in.  We also ordered a childhood favorite: cornflake shrimp - jumbo sized shrimp rolled in cornflakes and deepfried, served with a homemade tartar sauce.  We loved the variety on the menu and can't wait to go back to try more dishes, esp the ankimo and grilled tongue.

(Updated 10/25/07) We need a 6th star for this place.  Forget about Capital Grill, this is the place to go if you call yourself a foodie or want to be one.    The tasting menu at Binkley's is the way to go.  It starts off at $60 for 4 courses, $65-72 for 5 courses and $77 for 6 courses.  A steal, I tell you, compared to French Laundry's (where Kevin Binkley used to work) $200+ tasting menu and it's almost just as good plus you get to pick your dishes and you don't have to deal with 2 month advance reservations.  The drive to Cave Creek is so worth it!  Even more amazing is that they give you a ton of really creative amuse bouche (little morsels to amuse your mouth) before your first course even hits the table and then more throughout the meal.  We got at least ten tonight.  What a deal!  Just to give you an idea of the amuse bouche craziness, this is some of what we got in the last two meals (check out the pixs above if you wanna see what tasty looks like): - parsnip soup - baby zucchini with organic tomato-caper relish - tomato water with sriracha jelly & celery salt (on strobe light) - romeseco with Parmesan foam & eggplant chips - house pulled mozzarella with golden raisins & almond - sausage with artichoke chip - green apple sorbet & grapefruit sorbet - puffed wild rice crispy treat  Wine pairing is available and highly recommended.  Dan the sommelier is super cool and used to be a humanitarian photographer traveling all over 3rd world countries.  The staff here have really interesting backgrounds and manage to strike the balance between being professional and friendly.  Make sure to ask for the tasty potato chips (usually just served at the bar). If you can imagine those colorful Terra Chips reaching "be all that they can be" level of goodness, then you'd know what I mean.    Menu changes daily to keep with seasonality and what's fresh.  Hope they keep the divine Burgundy Truffle Pumpkin Agnolotti for a little longer so that I can have it at least one more time.

This is the place to get your Korean groceries.   The store seems quite new and is very clean.  It's not as big as Lee Lee's but is a good size for focusing on just Korean stuff.  They've got a large variety of items imported from Korea from household goods, cooking utensils, snacks, sauces, instant noodles, fresh fruits, vegetables, seafood and meat.   I never knew short ribs came in so many different qualities of cuts.  They also have lots of hard to find seafood too including skate wing.  We bought an awesome pack of frozen salted mackerel (3 fillets for less than $3).  All you have to do is coat it in some corn flour and shallow fry it.  It comes out just like the broiled mackerel you get in Japanese restaurants at a fraction of the price!

Dimsum today was unexpectedly good. Tried it on a weekday a few months ago and it was so-so but I could tell there was potential. Selection on weekends is way better than the weekday. They had my one of my favorites: steamed brown sugar cake ("Ma Lai Go") which I have not seen done right in a long time, even in Hong Kong. Color was a perfect brown and it was beautifully soft and spongey (it looks like a sponge too) and the flavor was not artificial like I've had so often.  I was almost as excited to see a pan-frying cart meaning a cart with hotplate where they pan-fry stuff like radish cake, chive dumplings and rice noodles to order.  Haven't seen that since Hong Kong and LA. This is huge as my major pet peeve with other places is that food gets cold as it makes the rounds on the cart.  The chive shrimp dumplings were wonderfully chivey and crispy on the outside while soft & moist inside.  Then the baked cart came around with buns I've never seen before. They let us mix and match any 3 so we picked a taro bun, "snow" bun with a milky filling and delicate crunchy white top, and a pineapple bun (pineapple refers to the appearance only) with custard filling. The snow bun is new to me and was absolutely delicious.  They're promoting all dimsum items that fall under category A, B or C for $2.25 each (B & C usually cost $3 or more). This place is under new management and hired a new award-winning dimsum chef according to the Chinese papers. The quality shows and I love the selection. Definitely will be back on a weekend!

Hands down best dim sum in the Valley. I've taken different groups of friends here on EVERY Sunday in the past two months, skipping only Easter, and have eaten like it's my last meal on Earth every time. All of my friends including Alex loved it and agree that it's the best dim sum in town right now. It's totally worth it even with the long drive from North Scottsdale and ridiculous weekend highway closures. Looks like I might be there again next Sunday...

Yummy brunch place in the northern reaches of Scottsdale  The salad here was also a winner.  Really liked the beet salad (beatnik salad)...the orange vinaigrette was so plate lickin' good  They make their own bagels which I found quite tasty, but oddly over priced...$0.75 for a bagel is fine...but do they really need to charge an extra $0.65 to spread some butter on it?  and it's $1.50 more to spread plain cream cheese on it...$2 extra if you're hankering for flavored cream cheese...Oy Vey!

5 stars for food, minus 1 star for lack of ambience and service.  Take-out highly recommended.  I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet.  It must be the best kept secret because to me this is the real deal.  You come here just for the food - there's zero ambience - it's inside, literally, a shack.  I'd recommend take-out but if you want to feel like you're eating at a roadside taco stand in Mexico, grab a seat at the counter by the blaring tv playing Mexican soaps.  This is a family affair - either the father or the mother usually mans it.  Some nights the whole family will be hanging out there waiting for the place to close at 9pm.  The owner told me they used to operate in California.    He's very proud of the fact that all the meats are cooked onsite from family recipes unlike most others which buy the meat preseasoned and cooked at Ranch Market.  This really shows - their meat is tender and bursting with flavor.  The pastor is a perfect balance of lean and fat pork resulting in a juicy tender filling for tacos.  Portions are also generous especially given the low prices, eg. the tasty cabeza (cow's head) was barely contained by the two soft tacos ($1.35).  I hope I didn't just spoil someone's secret.

Nee House does simple home-style Chinese cooking...where the homemaker isn't a very good cook and the only condiment in the cupboard is soy sauce.  It's either feast or famine here as far as the seasoning goes...the dishes were either too salty or underwhelmingly bland.  Wish I could say nicer things about this small neighborhood place other than that it's in the neighborhood.

A recent lunch at Nee House changed my whole opinion of this restaurant.  The crab and dried scallop fried rice was as good as the best fried rice I've eaten while living in Hong Kong. The rice kernels were perfectly al dente, not greasy, well-seasoned with the right restraint and the breath of the wok shined through deliciously.  Fried rice and noodles shows the real skill of a chef - it requires good control of heat and timing.   We also had the lobster with house special sauce. The lobster was plucked live from the tanks and weighed 2.75 lbs ($15/lb) so totaled approx. $40. The sauce was addictively spicy with sliced jalapenos and ample ground black pepper with the crunch of green onion tops - a little less sugar in the sauce would have made it perfect.  Young pea leaves are one of my favorite vegetables and usually available only at restaurants that see a lot of traffic from Chinese customers who appreciate them. They require some plucking to remove the less tender tendrils so tend to cost more. At Nee House, it cost $13.50 per plate. This is on the high side but I cannot resist the flavor and texture of the small tender dark green leaves so have to order it wherever it's served.  I asked for it to be cooked with garlic. It was cooked to the perfect level (nothing is worse than overcooked vegetables), albeit a bit oily.  The fried rice is more than enough reason to go back to Nee House.

After standing at the doorway for a few minutes, we were told to seat ourselves wherever we wanted.  After perusing the menu, we decided to ask for recommendations of what is the most authentic on the menu.  Jan launched into Thai and the conversation rapidly took off onto a tangent about ice cream.  We finally got back to the food and was recommended these dishes:  - Pad Kee Mow ($10) - stir-fried wide rice noodles with variety of veg and basil - Pad Grapow ($10) - stir-fried onions, basil, bell pepper  - Arizona Heat Wave ($12) - interesting name for red curry  Each comes with choice of meat.  We picked beef and chicken.  We asked for both white and brown rice which are provided without additional charge - a nice touch. We asked for medium spicy and the seasoning was spot on. Good balance of salty, spicy and sweet which is what makes Thai food so addictive.  I also liked the amount of vegetables that come with each dish, although more than what is traditional, it seems more healthy.  The food was so tasty we had to ask for another round of rice.    Even though we live 5 min from Osha, we've been afraid to try it for fear of being disappointed since we cook pretty decent Thai food at home.  I'm glad we finally took the plunge and look forward to going back for the excellent Pad Kee Mow, in particular.  Note that Osha is family run so the service can be a bit laid-back which is, actually, very Thai.  (Please note that the restaurant will be close Feb 1-19 for a family trip back to Thailand, according to the signs posted on the walls.)

When we read that the head baker at Simply Bread was part of the USA team that upset the European favorites and won the Coupe de Monde de la Boulangerie in 2005, we had to check it out.  You can get Simply Bread at AJ's and fine restaurants like Binkley's but we wanted to get right to the source.  They happened to be doing a promotion on mini rolls which was just perfect for us, given how indecisive we tend to be when presented with such variety.  We got:  -  Walnut raisin: my favorite when done right and it was here - complex  flavor from the long fermented dough, filled with thoughtfully sourced walnuts and raisins -  Black bean and corn: savory and nice crunchy texture from the cornmeal on top - good enough to eat on its own - Sundried tomato: tasty and tangy   -  Challah twist: pillowy soft with a hint of sweetness   Ah Simply Bread...  simply delicious...

While the food at Sol Y Sombra wasn't complicated, it was certainly yummy and the service was (surprisingly given the cool vibe and the beautiful people -- I mean the staff not just the customers) totally relaxed and friendly.  There we were schlepping in with our shorts and t-shirt...and without a reservation at that.   No attitude from the hostess.  Though the place was fully booked, we were happy with our bar seats...easy access to their yummy mojito and sangria..and the tapas started flowing.   On my  to be repeated list were the baby back ribs (for the sweet/tart quince and sprinkle of pimenton), the asparagus with crab (loved loved the romesco sauce) and the trout with sprinkle of hazelnut and salsa verde  Everything else (calamari, pan fried potatoes, brussel sprouts, mussels in tomato broth) were all solid.    3 stars for food alone and extra star for friendly service

THE GOOD:  Tortillas...soft, light, oozing with freshness...its all about the tortillas at Carolina's...and looking straight over the food counter into the kitchen where the cooks are lovingly tossing and stretching each piece of dough by hand  THE AVERAGE:  Bland decor and cafeteria style furniture  that they seem to have inherited from previous incarnation of this location  THE UGLY:   The fillings here have flavors so subtle (bland) that I couldn't taste much...looking around at the packed dining room, I thought may be I ordered the wrong thing...so I kept ordering...by the end of the meal I ate my way through the green corn tamale, the foot-long burro with house made chorizo, the machaca burro, the soft taco machaca and the green chile burro...I'm sad to report that  I couldn't find any tasty filling in all that  I wanted to like this place, but in the end, can't find a reason to come back.

Good inexpensive ethnic food in North Scottsdale is such a rarity and Saigon Nites is just that.    It's located in the Scottsdale Airpark area in the same center as Indian Paradise.  The room is relatively nice, service is friendly, prices are very reasonable and most shocking of all, the food is authentic and very good - it's almost too good to be true.  We had the special pho (rice noodles in beef broth with thin-sliced beef, tripe and meatballs) and banh xeo (giant crepe filled with a mix of meat and beansprouts).  The pho's broth was sweet, clean and complex - tasted like it was made with a generous amount of beef bones cooked for a long time over low heat - no hint of any artificial flavoring.  It was so good that I finished all the soup - that's never happened at Da Vang.    The banh xeo comprised of a large crepe made with rice flour filled with beansprouts, pork, shrimp and herbs.  It's served with leaves of iceberg lettuce and the classic nuoc cham dipping sauce.  This is probably one of the best-executed banh xeo I've had - the crepe was very thin and crispy.  The filling was on the bland side but the dipping sauce made up for it.  We can't wait to go back and try the other things on the menu, including the banh mi (Vietnamese-French sandwiches).

Awesome Chinese diner food...best I've had this side of San Gabriel Valley...just ignore the cheesy name and stripped down fast food furnishings  If you're not sure that Chinese diner food is like...think great stir fried noodle dishes (like the beef chow hoa in the picture above) and old school Chinese interpretation of Western dishes like baked pork chop smothered with tomato sauce on rice (check out the other picture above).  Michael (the chef) and his wife (up front) are friendly folks, so go ahead and chat them up for recommendation about what's good here.  Their best dishes are usually posted on the walls rather than in either of the 2 printed menu...go figure.

If you haven't had boba (a.k.a bubble tea, a.k.a. pearl tea), this place is a great intro.  The black chewy tapioca balls sucked through extra large straw are oddly addictive...and so are the super delicious iced tea.   The tea here come in a multitude of variety and combo...my fav is green jasmine honey milk tea with boba...take that Starbucks

So we have been driving by this pizza joint that seems to be perpetually closed, yet it looks pretty interesting on the outside...especially on this particularly quiet stretch of Cave Creek Rd.  Turns out that Johnnie's is only open Thursday through Sunday.  Johnny himself mans the pizza counter, giving long hellos to everyone.  Apparently, he has been turning out pizza in this location since the 90s.  So it's a total neighbor joint with lots of kids and families dropping in.  I would recommend the deluxe on thin crust...you might be tempted to go for the Joanie (slightly thicker crust) or the medium crust...but don't give in to this impulse...the crust here is perfectly crisp and quite dense, so thin is more than sufficient to satisfy the hungry beast.  Johnnie's has fresh toppings and good sauce.  But they do take 20 minutes to make the pizza to order, so phoning in your order before hand is a good idea.  Oh yeah, and Johnny will let you customize your pizza anyway you want...down to quarters.  3 stars for the pizza plus extra star for super customization and Johnnie with his friendly greetings for all.

Diverse selection of push-cart dimsum but unfortunately the lack of flow meant that some of the dimsum sat on the carts too long.  On the day we were at Peter Wong, some of the flavors were not quite right.  The tasty pan-fried chive dumplings stood out and is probably the only thing we'd order again.

If you're from one of those few places that lack Krispy Kreme (pls come back to Phoenix)...and is especially craving that special "HOT NOW" original glaze (oooh yum) experience.... then this is an easy access spot right off the Freemont Street Experience  Be careful though that just because the "HOT NOW" light is on, it doesn't mean that the donut line is running...you gotta check the window to see if the machines are actually running

Disappointed the first time, but with our faith in Mr K's taste, we tried it again and was pleasantly surprised.  First time we went for lunch and had mainly chaats (Indian snacks) $4.99-$5.99, which are only served Sat & Sun 12pm-5pm.  Our obsession with chaats started at the famous Vik's Chaat Corner in Berkeley, when we used to live in the area.  Unfortunately, the chaats here were lacking in flavor, which is a big problem given Indian food, especially chaats, is all about the spices.  For the Phoenix area, we prefer Little India Chaat in Tempe - it lacks decor and service but is made up by cheap prices and tasty food.  Given our obsession with good naan and our faith in Mr K's taste, we decided to give it another shot.  We went for dinner on a Sunday and ordered:  Saag Ghosht (lamb cubes with spinach in a light cream sauce) $12 - highly recommended by Howard Seftel as "helpfully" quoted on the side of the menu - we, on the other hand, found the lamb cubes themselves to be dry and bland despite being in a tasty sauce  Fish Goa Curry (fish filets in coconut curry sauce) $14 - Sunday's daily special so came with rice, one naan and salad - this fish was the BOMB: perfectly balanced subtle spices that complimented the tender flaky fish instead of overwhelming it - the naan is as good as Mr K claims  Great modern decor and good service.  We are definitely going back on a Sunday night for the Fish Goa.  Thanks for another good recommendation Mr K!

So tasty it's worth the charred meat smell that lingers for days (despite multiple ablution)  When I get that craving for spicy, piquant, charred protein...nothing will satisfy till I can chow down a huge platter of galbi...gnawing away at the yummy bits next to the bone...Seoul Garden is where I go for my Korean bbq fix.  I also love the dol-sot bibimbap here...the rice sizzling at the bottom of the stone pot forms into a nice crunchy crust...and if it's more starch that you want, then I'd happily recommend the seafood with green onion pancake  Like all terrific Korean bbq places, the meat platters come with endless little bowls of kimchi in all its various glorious permutations...and if you can manage to plow your way though all that, they'll bring you more till you're literally rolling out of the restaurant.

Perhaps it was because I had skipped breakfast or perhaps it was love at first sight, but food that would have normally tasted average to me, suddenly became delicious!    We gobbled up the overcooked brussel sprouts with bland slivers of bacon and inhaled the roasted sweet potato pancakes ($8 including choice of bacon or sausage) which were the furthest thing from fluffly.  But it didn't matter because love is blind or, in this case, taste-blind.  We fell in love with the cuteness of this place as soon as we walked in.  We went for lunch on a Friday at peak hour and had to wait in line for almost 15min to place our order.   That was quickly forgotten when we managed to snag some comfy couches outside under the shade of a giant sun umbrella.    Our food was brought to us quicker than our wait in line.  (FYI, you're given a number on a stand which you put on your table.  This is brilliant because it allows you to sit anywhere you want after you place your order.)  Even more brilliant is the way they put together the tarts.  Instead of baking them ahead of time, they only bake the crust ahead and cook the fillings to order - this cuts down on wastage at the end of the day and speeds up cooking time.  Our mushroom tart was creamy and decadent ($9.50 includes choice of pear salad or brussel sprouts - salad was much better).  The cafe au lait ($2) was unfortunately on the watery side but the slim mint tea ($2.50) which comes in a large pot was delicious.   They're open 7am-3pm everyday except Monday and have recently  stayed open into the evening for First Fridays.

Personally, I way prefer a la carte vs push cart because inevitably you go in starving and fill up on stuff you don't really want while waiting for that ever illusive har gow.    Freshness is also another big factor - depending on how far your table is from the kitchen and the whims of the push cart person, the food you just ordered from the cart may have  gone around many laps already.  You can tell when a dumpling is not fresh by how the skins stick to each other.    My stomach real estate is too precious for all these uncertainties - apparently agreed with by most people in Hong Kong and Vancouver, where almost all restaurants serve dim sum a la carte.  China Chan now serves dim sum everyday.  The dim sum menu is short but sweet with just over 20 items covering most of my cravings.  Nearly everything I've ordered has been above average.   Definitely a case of quality over quantity.  In addition, they also offer choice of tea...go for the blend of black tea & chrysanthemum tea.     Loved it: - Har Gow:  Well-flavored single bite dumpling with tasty shrimp inside a nice chewy rice pastry (not the biggest shrimps but can't complain at $1.80) - Egg Custard Tarts:  I   was lucky to place my order just as a fresh batch entered the oven...the deliciously melty custard filling was hot enough to burn - Daikon Cakes:  Nicely browned crust.  Filled with loads of shredded daikon (similar to radish).  Better with a dab of chili sauce.  - Tripe with Ginger & Scallion:  Great crunch and addictive salty tang.    Liked it: - Steamed BBQ Pork Bun:  Great fluffy texture on the bun, though could be a bit more generous with the fillings -  Steamed Lotus Flavored Rice:  A generous patty of glutinous rice and minced chicken filling wrapped in a Lotus Leaf and then steamed. - Fried Ham Sui Gok:  Deep fried glutinous rice pastry filled with minced pork. - Spare ribs steamed with Black Bean Sauce  - Steamed beef balls:  Great bouncy texture that you'd enjoy more if you just forget about the beef part of the description since it takes quite a bit of flour to get these things going.  Could have done without it: -  Fried Taro Turnover;  The pastry crust was a bit flat and heavy rather than light and puffy.   If you go to China Chan on weekends, be prepared for a bit of a wait since most dim sum dishes (with exception of the deep fried items) are cooked to order.  This definitely beats the push carts since most things reach the table piping hot.   UPDATE (7/31/2007): Yikes...can't recommend China Chan for anything but dimsum...just went here for dinner and it was really really average...cheap as heck ($22 set meal for 4), but tasted as if a completely different kitchen was responsible for dinner in striking contrast to the awesome dimsum.

5 stars for fresh inexpensive dimsum, minus one star for decor.  It's been a while since we've been back but since it's Chinese New Year, it's worth the trip.    I was excited to see an expanded menu, especially the Pineapple Bun with Char Siu, which I had asked them repeatedly to add, since it was all the rage in HK and Vancouver.  As far as I know, no other restaurant in the Valley offers it.  There is actually no pineapple - just looks a bit like the outside of one on the top, which is sweet and crunchy, providing great contrast to the savory roasted pork filling.  Everything's as good as I remember with the same ridiculously low prices. Only the Chiu Chow dumpling was disappointing - soggy wrapper with dried out meat filling.  Can't believe this place is not packed to the rafters.  I say ditch the old-fashioned push carts and choose dimsum steamed to order!  Plus they now have picture menus!

A total oasis from the summer heat.  This friendly and well stocked neighborhood library is never crowded, so you can alway grab a free PC or a free table if you're lugging your own laptop.  The selection of books and dvds are really good too.

Del Piero uses all local ingredients.  I had a better experience than Alex and Kelly.  Maybe it's what I ordered.  I got the bruschetta ($8.79).  You get to choose 3 different toppings and you get 2 pieces of each.  I chose:  1) Mushroom - roasted wild mushrooms topped with caramelized onions (delicious)  2) Caprese - tomato, basil and mozzarella drizzled with Tuscan Estate extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) (needed more salt and EVOO which I remedied by using the oil at the olive tasting bar)   3) Roasted peppers - roasted red bell peppers and local goat cheese (peppers were so juicy that it squirted across the table when I bit into it and the goat cheese was yummy)  All served on sliced baguette from the Willo Baking Company.  There are only a few tables inside but lots of tables outside in their beautiful olive garden.  Online menu: https://www.queencreekolivemill.com/Menu.pdf

This place is ambitious:  they bake their own bread, churn their own gelato, make salads, sandwiches, pastas and stir-fries to order, and offer a huge selection of gourmet grab and go foods.  Starting at 5pm, the bistro to the side offers a hit-list of American favorites like burgers and grilled tuna as well as a full bar.  We chose to eat from the take-out side and ordered the fish of the day from the grill.  $8 includes two sides and a house-baked roll.  We ordered the salmon fillet grilled medium-rare with drunken beans (pinto cooked in beer) and mac-n-cheese.  By the time we had paid at the register and walked back to the grill, our food was ready,  The salmon was cooked perfectly with nice char marks on the outside and pink on the inside.  The pinto beans were tasty enough to be a dish in itself.  The mac-n-cheese was actually fusilli-n-cheese which probably works better because the twists in the fusilli help it to stay al dente longer.  We contemplated having the buttermilk panna cotta for dessert but when we saw that it didn't wiggle when shaken, we opted for the gelato instead.  3 bucks for a small cup of pistachio and coffee, which the guy behind the counter packed way high.  We plan to come back for happy hour which is apparently offered all day on Thursday.

I've always found large portions to be unappealing as my taste buds  hit the plateau of diminishing returns usually after 3 bites.  Stax solves that problem by offering 3oz sliders around $4-$5 and tons of choices for customizing them.    The Moroccan Colorado lamb and the good ol' beef burger were nicely charred and full of flavor.  The sweet potato fries at $3.75 was not only delicious but a great deal given the generous serving.  The garlic aioli goes great with it.    I appreciated the no pressure service.  Even though between the two of us we only ordered a slider each and shared one order of fries, the server was cool with it.

Despite the name, Pure Sushi isn't for Sushi purists...but if you're a fan of rolls, then good times may be found here.    Pure Sushi is all about monster rolls...with fillings that ranges from crabs to shrimp tempura to deep fried soft shell crabs...and over the top are things like salmon, halibut & scallops...and to top it all of, you get wide range of sauces from sweet onion salsa to sweet chili to  kiwi yuzu.   Also good selection of bento box lunches though the loungy atmosphere and thumping music can feel slightly off in the bright Phoenix noon day.    Really just 3 stars for the food, but we added an extra star for the spacious patio and cool decor.

Definitely a 4-star food experience for me...as it is a German place...you gotta ask yourself if you like German food...  I lucked in during happy hours so saved a bunch of mullah while enjoying the tasty draft and excellent bar food  Reasons to go back:  (1)  Smoked Salmon Rosti --- a tasty potato pancake topped with more smoked salmon than I could shake a stick at...and the slightly sweet & tangy horseradish sauce just put it over the top for me...   (2)  $2.50 for 17 oz of tasty draft  (3)  Darn good Bratwurt and the crunchiest most well seasoned fries that I've come across in a long long time  And it was a friendly crowd to boot  My only disappointment was the absence of my favorite german dish from the menu...how can anyone not like deep fried pig's knuckle?...it's ummmm good

Everything here tasted like fried chicken, which is a good thing if you like fried chicken.   The catfish I had also tasted vaguely of chicken...also Mrs White used the same batter for both...very light and crisp...though I must admit to preferring the touch of cornmeal like the way that they do it at Lolo's.    Mrs. White's also got some mean chicken fried steak here.  All the meal platter work out to be $11 (after taxes) and you get choices of 2 sides.    Good solid rendition of soul food:  3 stars place with extra points for longevity.

Where in Phoenix can you go  for an eco-friendly make over for your home?  aka Green has got your number  Heat resistance counter top made of recycled materials?  Absolutely, and  will you be taking that in glass or paper?   Low emission paint?  Totally  Alternative flooring? Check   And these stuff look good too...the aka green people were friendly and informative...I had a blast window shopping...and I'd be back when I'm ready to renovate

I forgot where I was for a moment when I stepped into Andreoli.  How did I end up in a cafe reminscent of the ones I lingered over vino at in Tuscany?    I was surrounded by wooden antique shelves filled with Italian dry pastas, olive oils and mini jam jars.  The long deli case is filled with all kinds of meats, cheeses and homemade pastries.    The menu (available on website) is comprised of panini, antipasti (calamari, pizzas) and salads.  You order at the deli counter and if you're eating in, they bring the food to you and on real plates.  We ordered one thing from each section:  - bresaola con ruchetta e parmigiano: thin-sliced air-cured beef on an arugula salad and shaved parmesan  $6.50  - panino di tizio: grilled homemade sausage, bell peppers and onions in a toasted baguette  $7.50  - le palle del papa: baked breaded rice balls filled with meat sauce, parmesan and peas  $5.00  - sfogliatelle: shell-shaped multi-layered pastry filled with homemade ricotta  $2.75  The sausage and air-cured beef were delizioso!  The rice ball was the size of a baseball and packed with tasty fillings.  My only complaint was that the arugula salad contained hardly any arugula, but that's not going to stop me from coming back to try the daily pasta specials.   Can't handle the hefty airfare and expensive Euro?  This is the next best thing!  Molto bene!

Best coffee beans this side of Stumptown...so unless you got tons of frequent flyer miles to take you to Portland, a drive to Goodyear is what it's gonna take for an absolute 5-star coffee experience  Indeed, Ground Control's slick decor behind its bland strip mall exterior makes this a place where you really wanna linger over your latte.  And the house made gelato is on the high side of enticing.  But the lure that drags me into my car and take that hour long drive down to Goodyear is gonna be the awesome orange monster in the back of the room where the coffee beans are roasted several times a week...from medium to dark, no wimpy light roast here.  Yes, you can absolutely taste the freshness.  My personal favorite is Guatemala Huehuetenango.  With beans this good, I take it black...so smooth you don't need cream to take the non-existent hard-edge off, nor is any sugar needed to counter the non-existent sour off-notes (unlike a big chain competitor).    And if you end up hanging out so long that you actually need more solid nourishment, then the Mediterranean Salad with the tasty bits of candied pecans and mozzarella is spot on, while the pesto salami panini is not half bad.

I love the use of lemon zest to lighten up a pizza especially as the weather gets warmer.  There was a light sprinkle of it on my clam pie even though it was not mentioned in the menu and it was also on the shrimp pie as well as the olive oil gelato in a candied version.    The clam pie was a little disappointing - I was hoping for something like the ones I've tasted in NYC.  Clams are such subtle things that more needs to be used and I would not mind paying a few more dollars for that.  Our disappointment was quickly redeemed by the wonderfully refreshing and  balanced flavor of the shrimp pie.  The combination of perfectly cooked crunchy shrimp, basil, chili flakes and lemon zest set off fireworks on every part of my palate.  It's something I would definitely go back for.    The pizza crust has a great contrast of crunch as well as chewiness which reminds me of the crust at Mozza in LA but it does not have the complexity in flavor of Chris Bianco's.  Bianco's probably uses a starter dough that has developed that amazing flavor due to over a decade of use.  That's tough to beat.  The olive oil gelato has a nice creaminess to it but tasted more like sweet cream base with a hint of lemon than olive oil.  My only problem with it was my expectation to taste olive oil but now that I know it's more about the texture, I think I like it more.

Newly opened no frills supermarket import from the UK with interesting ethnic food selection.  The fruits and vegetables wrapped in clear plastic sitting on black crates reminds me of my neighborhood Tesco's from my days in London.   Cool thing about this one is the variety of products carried on the shelves.  When's the last time you're seen tripe or pig's feet at Albertson's or Safeway.  And hooray, I can finally buy Chaokoh (the only good brand of coconut milk) in Scottsdale without having to trek all the way down to Lee Lee's or Ranch Market.   Great selection of fresh meats and cheeses.  The only place apart from Trader Joe's that I've seen unpasteurized orange juice, which by the way tastes way better because heat kills the fresh taste.  Much-needed addition to an area saturated by the boring standards.

Good place to fuel up for the drive to LA.  Yummy housemade corned beef hash + generous portions + homey decor + fun concept (menu written in what looks like a town paper) + friendly service  = good value

Given the scarcity of good ethnic options in the North Scottsdale area, Indian Paradise deserves another star.  We've been on an ethnic binge this week and decided to check out the buffet lunch again.    The garlic naan was brought hot to the table and refilled when our basket went empty.  It had a great crispy charred exterior.  The tandoori chicken tasted brined which probably contributed to the tenderness.  Pretty good selection of veg options like veg korma (mild creamy sauce), dal makhani (lentils), chana masala (chickpeas) and saag (spinach) with potatoes.  All in all a great value and we look forward to coming back for the weekend champagne brunch which is priced at $11.95 and includes one drink.  Buffet offering is also supposed to be more extensive.  Don't forget to grab a bag of crispy spiced snacks on the way out.  They're better than chips and very addictive.

Bourbon Steak, chef Michael Mina's 12th restaurant, is scheduled to open officially on Feb 11th at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess. $6.9 million is said to have been invested into this NY-style American steakhouse, featuring such premium cuts as Japanese "A5" Kobe beef filet mignon priced just under $200.  Last night, we had the honor of being invited to their first preview hosted by FBR.  As we walked in through the foyer flanked by floor to ceiling rows of glorious wine, we got a glimpse of chef Mina autographing his cookbook for a guest but that was the last we saw of him.  The space has a very masculine NY monochromatic decor befitting a steakhouse.  Prior to dinner, we were offered kobe sliders, which were a bit messy as finger food and looked better than they tasted.  Servers also offered us a choice of sauv blanc or the 2003 Silver Oak Cab.    As we pondered over the menu, a trio of duck fat fries with a trio of sauces and focaccia in a large cast iron pan were brought to our table.  Honestly, I could not taste the difference with the duck fat but the truffle cream sauce was very good.  The focaccia would have benefited from more olive oil and herbs.    First course was the bibb wedge salad - three wedges of the lettuce served on a bed of avocado puree and topped with Oregon smokey blue cheese and bacon bits.  The bibb lettuce was sweet and crisp contrasting nicely with the intensity of the savory blue cheese.  The avocado didn't contribute much except to hold the wedges in their place.   For mains, we were offered a choice of wood-grilled chicken, miso-glazed black cod, and all-natural filet mignon.  All were served with foraged mushrooms, truffled mac & cheese (oddly with bits of broccoli florets) and creamed spinach.    Btw, what does all-natural mean?  As opposed to part artificial elsewhere?  And while I'm at it, did the captain really have to explain that foraged means wild?  Nobody at our table ordered chicken so I can't comment on it.  The filet mignon was of course tender and surprisingly flavorful given the cut - it was probably slow-cooked at a low temperature and then quickly seared on the grill to give it the nice crust.    The cod, a classic Japanese preparation made popular by Nobu, was the most moist and flaky version I've ever tasted.  Unfortunately the heavy sides did not pair as well with the fish as they did with the steak.  The forager of the mushrooms will be disappointed to hear that their hard work was wasted.  The mushrooms were undercooked - still containing a lot of their moisture and acidity.  Three other sides were brought in cast iron pans to the table for sharing - marble potatoes Lyonnaise (baby black and white potatoes with caramelized onions - delicious), sour cream & onion potato puree (this was way too wet - almost soupy), and glazed baby carrots.  Everyone at the table found the food to be overly salted, probably compounded by the heaviness of each side.  Feeling a bit laden, we hoped for some brighter tastes in our dessert.  Alas it was not to be.  Beignets, churros and doughnuts:  I challenge you to find a heavier combination.   - The beignets were served with a trio of pot de creme - vanilla creme brulee, chocolate and the highlight an 18-yr Macallan butterscotch. - The citrus churros were served with a shot of Mexican spiced hot chocolate.   - The doughnuts with half a caramelized banana and cinnamon ice cream.  The doughy fried concoctions would probably have been delicious on their own but all together they were too alike.  The ice cream flavored with ground cinnamon was gritty and overpowering.  Would have been much better if they had used cinnamon sticks to flavor their mix and strained it out before churning.  Bourbon Steak still has a quite a few kinks to work out before their opening in less than 2 weeks.  With almost $7 million invested, I have no doubt that they will deserve 5 stars when that happens.

Fine's Cellar is offering 50% off their entire food menu on Mondays until June so we had to check it out last night.    We ordered 3 apps: duck confit bratwurst w/sauerkraut, mac & cheese trio (blue cheese, truffle oil, peas & pancetta), pigs in a blanket (pork belly & caramelized onions wrapped in crepe);   and a salad - Caesar b/c of the deepfried anchovy but was disappointed to find it lacklustre and cold. This dish was our least favorite with no eggs or bacon to be found. Romaine was left whole, just chopped in half lengthwise - didn't have enough dressing coverage this way.  All we tasted were the parmigiano shavings which overwhelmed the plate.  and one main - Bacon crusted ribeye on blue cheese hash browns (requested w/o blue cheese). This was our favorite.  Ribeye was crusted with a tasty green substance which must have been the bacon.  Hash browns were very crispy.  Dish had lots of flavor and texture and begged for a glass of big red wine to accompany it.  The food came out fast (probably b/c we went at 9:30 and they were ready to close up). Bites were not bad and many featured cheese, esp blue.  The star was definitely the ribeye on hash - very tasty ($28 before discount so only $14 after).  We'll be back on Mondays with this good a deal.

Fine's Cellar deserves another star for tonight's delicious food and wonderful service. Went back tonight for the Mon night 50% food promo. Had the Cobb salad, Duck Leg and Loup de Mer.  Cobb salad was a deconstructed version with various components (prosciutto, boiled egg, sundried tomato, roasted green onions, blue cheese, avocado and roasted golden beets) arranged neatly in rows on dressed greens. It looked beautiful and redeemed the lacklustre Caesar I had on my previous visit.  Duck leg was absolutely delicious - crispy skin, moist flavorful meat - on a bed of mushroom fricasee and silky mash. My only complaint is that there wasn't more. I could probably have eaten four plates.  Loup de mer is a whole deboned roasted sea bass, stuffed, this time with polenta and spinach. The sauce was very tasty and made the dish. Wish I had known to ask for bread so that no sauce was wasted.  Our server this time was Cord and he was friendly and professional even though we sat down only 1/2 hour before closing. His service definitely elevated our dining experience and contributed an additional 1/2 star.

BBQ pork sandwich and the fried okra were delicious.  BBQ sauce was a tad on the sweet side but otherwise had some nice complex smokey flavors.  Okra coated in cornmeal was crunchy on the outside contrasting perfectly to the moist interior.  The sweet potato fries were disappointing - soggy and too sweet - would have preferred the use of salt instead of sugar to bring out the natural sweetness.  Decor's minimal but clean.  Service is friendly although a bit slow but worth the wait.

I never realized there were other restaurants behind Claim Jumper on Shea until Alex C. told me about Little Rangoon.  And what a find it is!  The restaurant opened early this year taking over an Italian restaurant with Roman pillars and the works.  The owners added artwork brought over from Asia to make it their own - the East meets West look is really quite elegant.   Alfred the owner manages the front of house and his Burmese wife is in charge of the kitchen.  The couple's love and pride for what they do shows in every aspect from decor to service to food.  As a fellow small business owner I can really appreciate that.  We followed Alfred's recommendations and ordered the "more" Burmese dishes (vs other dishes with greater influence from bordering countries like Thailand and India).  We're glad we did because starting with the Tea Leaf Salad, we had a chance to taste things that we've never experienced before even after living many years in Bangkok.    Excellent food and service at a great value - we'll definitely be back.

The Olive Mill brings back sweet memories of the trips I used to take to the Napa Valley wineries when I lived in the Bay Area.  The place is tastefully decorated with aisles of products made with their olives - extra virgin olive oil, flavored oils, stuffed olives and tapenades.  I love the olive bar where you get to taste all their products.  Half hour tours are offered every hour for $5 per person.  They also sell bread from the Willo Baking Company, gelato from Berto's and local pistachios.  I'd recommend printing out directions from their website.  Don't forget to drop by the Pork Shop afterwards - only 2 miles down the road to pick up the Valley's best pork products.

So I've had a bad day...all of a sudden finding a nasty scratch all the way across both my side doors...the guys at the dealer recommended body shop are quoting 4 figure repair bills.  Lucky me, I gave "We Fix Ugly Bumpers" call.  Claudia shows up right at my drive way...and for a reasonable price fixed the scratch right there while I wait in the comfort of my own home.  The name may be "ugly"...but now my little Subaru is beautiful again.  The only down side is that  they only do minor bumps & dents.  You'll have to go elsewhere for major body work.

Another nasty auto day...and another raving review of Claudia and team at We Fix Ugly Bumpers.  So we were driving a van that just simply died right in front of an intersection...Claudia coincidentally happen to be pulling out of a nearby plaza and some how recognized the distraught people stranded in the middle of the street as former customers...she pulled right over and tried to help...she and her partner even went so far as to drive to the nearest gas station and brought us back some gas in case the problem was simply that the van ran out gas...alas that wasn't the case and we ended up calling AAA for a tow.  Claudia then gave us an ice cold bottle of water to tide us over while we waited.  What fantastic people.

3 stars for the food with an additional star for originality, service and decor.  We were a bit hesitant to try Bombay Spice after reading Mr K's review on their first location.  It seems that the owners have taken Mr K's advice to heart and upped the level of spice.  Bombay Spice offers a healthy interpretation of Indian food by not deepfrying, not using butter, ghee (clarified butter), or cream.  Unfortunately this means that the Samosa loses all crunch with the filling steaming up the outer pastry.  The potato filling was nicely spiced  but that still didn't make up for the soft exterior.  The Chickpea Ceviche - a grander name for the Indian street snack Bhel Puri on the other hand would have benefited from more spices.  The Pappadums that are offered with it is a nice crispy contrast to the cool and tangy combination of chickpeas, cucumbers, tamarind, mint and coriander.  Not sure why I ordered the Seared Scallops in landlocked Phoenix.  I still remember Spike on Top Chef this season madly drying his frozen scallops and still did not manage get the crispy outer sear on his scallops.  Similarly these had a nice dark sear but the exterior was not in the least bit crispy.  The veggie skewer accompanying it had nice smokiness from being chargrilled.  The lamb chops or more appropriately lamb lollipops on the other hand was overly spiced.  We wish it was served with some starch or even a few slices of cucumber for contrast.  A great alternative to the usually heavy Indian food.  I will definitely give them another try in hopes that they get their spicing under control.  I love the decor and the way the chef came out to describe food reminded us of ourselves at our ice cream shop.  Hooray for independents with innovative original concepts!

Just as Jan and I were lamenting the lack of authentic Thai restaurants in the Valley, we happened to fall upon Thai House in North Scottsdale yesterday.  And what a find it is!  We dropped by after shopping at the nearby Staples to check out the menu and felt great vibes right away.  It was packed with the office lunch crowd and the room was filled with delicious aromas.  If it wasn't for the fact that we had just stuffed our faces at Indian Paradise's buffet, we would have ordered something.   I couldn't stop thinking about the promise of good Thai food and ordered the Pad Kee Mao noodles and Prik Khing stirfry for lunch today.  Even two hours after I had ordered the takeout and managed to finally sit down for lunch, the food was still off the hook.  It totally compared to the Thai food we've had in LA's Thai Town and even Bangkok where Jan's from.  Pad Kee Mao is a fiery spicy stirfry of flat rice noodles with choice of meat, egg, garlic, onion, bell peppers, chili and Thai basil leaves.  We were impressed by how al dente yet ungreasy the noodles were.  Our beef was tender and the flavors were spot on.  The Prik King is a stirfry of meat in red curry paste, green beans, bell pepper and kaffir lime leaves.  The generous garnish of finely julienned kaffir limes leaves struck us even before we dug into the dish.  It's labeled as lemon leaves on the menu probably to not scare off customers.  The leaves offer a deliciously complex and zesty contrast to strongly flavored dishes.  We find that often in the Valley these authentic touches are left out because the restaurant owners find that patrons don't notice the difference.  It's a slippery slope.  It does seem presumptious to rate Thai House based on only two dishes but I can't remember the last time I smiled ear to ear after eating a meal out of a styrofoam box.  To top it off, the dining room is homey and service is friendly.  I can't wait to go back to try the other dishes.

It was the euphoria of the deliciously spicy Pad Kee Mao and Pad Phrik King  that prompted the five star review.  After returning for another takeout, I have to, unfortunately, remove one star for the disappointingly lacklustre Som Tum (papaya salad) and Larb (ground chicken salad with herbs).    Both dishes were unbalanced and one dimensional - we tasted only fish sauce and chilies - many of the other components were missing.  The fish sauce didn't even taste Thai (there is a huge difference between fish sauce from Thailand vs Vietnam - probably depending on the type of fish used).  Wonder if the chef was on summer vacation.  So 5 stars for Pad Kee Mao and Pad Phrik King (ask for it to be spicy in Thai if you want it  really spicy - "Phed Maa").  3 stars for the Som Tum and Larb.  We'll have to go back and test out some other dishes to give a final verdict.

Went to Thai House again today and ordered the Pad Kee Mao and Phrik King that prompted us to enthusiastically give Thai House 5 stars.  Unfortunately we were disappointed.  Neither dishes were as fiery and complex in flavor as the first time.  We ordered beef with both again and the beef was not as moist and tender as previously.     However even though they were not 5 star dishes, they were still much better than most Thai meals we've had in the Valley.

I think grand is a word I'll be using over and over to describe the decor of Amarone.  It looks nothing remotely like Pizza a Metro.  From the gates through which you enter the restaurant, to the enormous round marble bar which has lights shining up through it, to the giant chandeliers, it seems that the recession has not hit this part of Scottsdale.    The grandeur seems out of place in this tired strip mall with its bowling alley and assortment of small businesses.  But once you're inside, you feel like you're in a different world - somewhere between a restaurant in NYC's Little Italy and a swanky hotel bar.    Maurizio and his friendly team were gracious enough to seat us even though we arrived past 10pm on a weeknight (kitchen closes at 10pm).  The fresh out-of-the-oven pita-like bread that Metro is so known for hit our table first with a side of caramelized onions and other aromatics.  We really liked the light coating of olive oil and salt on the warm thin bread.  Then came our order:  Stuffed Mushrooms $10 - shrooms stuffed with sausage, ricotta, parmesan in a lemon garlic veal stock reduction:  lots of flavor although the stuffing tasted a bit too much like liver for one of us  Shrimp Scampi $11- half dozen large butterflied shrimp in a lemon butter white wine sauce:  the shrimp were huge but unfortunately lacked flavor   Homemade Gnocchi  $14 - in a tomato sauce with cubes of mozz and basil: the light and airy gnocchi was definitely our fave  I found the sauces on my two apps a bit unbalanced and the plating old-fashioned.  It seems that the dishes that Metro are known for are still the stars here.  Given how large the menu is, I really need to come back and try a few of the 16 pastas ($14-$23) and 17 mains ($18-$28) before I can give a real verdict.    Get the word out: Amarone is open for business!

Having lived in Bangkok and living with a Thai partner, I have to admit I'm a bit picky when it comes to Thai food.  I came here one night with Alex C and we ordered an insane amount of food.  The deboned and stuffed chicken wings were definitely the highlight.  Everything else was above average compared to other Thai places in town.  Portions were generous and the quality of ingredients quite high.  The Spicy Basil would have benefited from more basil to compliment the perfectly cooked tender beef.  The BBQ chicken was disappointingly bland and the sauce it was served with was too sweet and not what's traditionally used.    I was expecting the food to be spicier after reading the previous reviews.  Next time I'll have to ask them for Thai spicy.

If you like authentic sushi (i.e. not crazy rolls where you can't taste the freshness of the fish), sit at the sushi bar and let the chef know. He'll hook you up with some out of the world food that you won't forget. They have the best selection of fish in town and amazing variety of condiments from Japan, including fresh wasabi root that's grated to order.

Yeah to fellow independent biz owners Stacey and Scott for starting Yogurt Builderz.  This is a great new concept where customers serve themselves and pay by weight.  The store is spacious, colorful and tastefully designed.  I really like the Lemon Custard Tart yogurt with fresh raspberries - it had a great balance of tanginess and creaminess - plus it's lowfat.  Stacey also recommends it with white chocolate sauce.  Go check it out and support local small businesses!

This is by far the best farmer's market I've been to in the Valley.  Still small by comparison to LA and the Bay Area but is off to a great start with lots of potential and space to grow into.  McClendon has a great spread of high quality mainly organic produce and is constantly restocking so it's ok if you don't get there first thing.  It was exciting to see beautiful Tuscan kale and broccoli rabe at prices lower than Sprouts.  Meyer lemons and blood oranges were also available.  Phoenician's outstanding loaves were only $3. You're welcome to sample - we particularly liked the Olive Walnut and Dark Chocolate Cherry.  We enjoyed Digestif's Frittata ($4) made with thin layers of potato, eggs, pork belly and spinach.  Other combinations available were Dandelion with Goat Cheese and Mushrooms with Garlic Confit. Executive Chef Payton Curry is also there to demonstrate pulling fresh mozzarella which is served with a variety of sauces and toppings,  It was fun walking around this bustling market sampling food, like tamales, which we intend to come back for next week.  If I can get myself out of bed at a decent hour on Sat, I'll be here for sure every week until the season ends in May.

This is the place to shop for restaurant equipment and supplies at great prices.  Best of all, it's open to anyone with a Costco membership.  Don't forget to fill up your car while you're here - prices are some of the lowest in town.

After much delay, Autostrada is finally open, surprisingly with little fanfare.   The couple we were meeting had trouble finding the new Italian osteria in DC Ranch.  Apart from a large red "A" vinyl on the doors, there was no other signage.  It's located at the intersection across from The Armitage.  The menu is simple and straightforward at very palatable prices - nothing is over $18.  Food is encouraged to be shared family style.  All of which sounds like a great concept in a recessionary environment.  None of the antipasti piqued our interest so we jumped straight to the pastas. Fettuccine with scallops and mushrooms ($17) and orchiette with pork sugo and peas.  The marscapone sauce on the fettucine was deliciously creamy although a touch heavy handed.  The pork sugo was a bit too sweet and the dish just fell flat for us.  For the main, we shared the roasted sea bass with fennel and tomato ($16) and NY strip steak (pre-sliced for easy sharing) on potato and sunchoke puree.  Both were solid dishes.  Steak had great flavor but oddly it was not sliced across the grain and had a little gristle.  Our favorites were the contorni (aka sides). The tiella - baked layers of eggplant, zucchini & tomato topped with parmesan was packed with flavor and delicious just as Gabi said.  The baby artichokes were fried to a nice crisp on the outside contrasting nicely with the tender interior.  For dessert, we chose vanilla bean panna cotta with sliced strawberries and the marscapone tart with poached pears and spiced walnuts.  Again both were solid dishes.  The interior has an industrial cool vibe to it with a long metal bench running along the wall and a stainless steel walled kitchen that runs across, separated by glass so you can get a full view of the action from most of the dining room.  There is an equal if not greater number of seating outdoors including tables for up to 8.  Autostrada serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It is Chef Aaron May of Sol y Sombra, Over Easy and The Lodge fame's latest dining destination.

Crudo is two completely different concepts depending on when you go but the cooking is top-notch no matter when. The food is lovingly made in a tiny kitchen in a hair salon (yes, hair salon) by two experienced and talented chefs - Cullen and Brandon. No sous chefs, no line cooks - these two former exec chefs do it all - from french toast in the morning to salads and sandwiches to lunch to the some of the most sophisticated food I've ever had in the US in the evening.  The gift shop setting is a bit unusual but the customer benefits in a huge way. By not being beholden to investors and sky high Old Town Scottsdale rent, the chefs are able to deliver 6-star food that they're truly passionate about at super reasonable prices for dinner.  There is a serious lack of creativity and daring in most of the Valley but not at Crudo where it's done with sophistication. Crudo can be described as new-style sashimi - raw fish dressed lightly with some kind of oil and acid and garnished with tasty herbs, fruit or even black truffle shavings - giving the diner a delightful spectrum of flavors and textures. One of my favorites so far is albacore topped with crunchy strips of tart apple, intensely flavored black garlic and black truffle.   The freshness and quality of their raw fish surpasses most sushi restaurants in the Valley. I loved the madai red snapper they sourced in an auction from the best seafood market in the world - Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market. The fish changes weekly depending on the auction. Crudo is all about cooking in the season and local ingredients. I love the salad bar at lunch and seasonal vegetable crudo at dinner both using top notch produce from Maya's Farm. Personally I find salad bars in most places boring but here you find delicious atypical vegetables like crunchy purslane, sea beans, ramps and fennel fronds, which I had to fight other people for at NYC's Union Sq Farmers' Market.  Crudo is one of the most exciting restaurants in the Valley right now and at $30 for 3 savory courses, I plan to be there at least once a week.

If I could only eat at one place for the rest of my life, it would have to be at FnB. This is ultimate comfort food for me - with the bulk of the menu highlighting local in-season organic vegetables from McClendon and other local farms. Charleen prepares dishes that pay the ultimate homage to the vegetable and the farmer with perfect seasoning, contrast, balance and temperatures.   Beyond vegetables, the housemade burrata was light as a cloud and shrimp grilled to perfection on the mesquite. Dishes at FnB are simple but often the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right as there is nothing to hide behind - ingredients have to be fresh and of the highest quality and execution must be perfect. Charleen and her crew strike it out of the park almost every time.  Service is professional, attentive and friendly. Pavle and his team make you feel right at home, which is the other reason why I would happily eat here everyday.

Authentic Mexican food made with quality ingredients in a comfortable setting. Salsa bar has great variety from the usual to ones with strawberry. Munch on salsa and chips while they make your food which does take a little time as it's cooked to order. I like my food spicy but like to counter it with their horchata which is chock full of fruit and pecans. My favorites are the chicken mole and grilled veggie tacos.

Don't miss the new @NobuoAtTeeter headed by James Beard award winner Nobuo Fukuda formerly of Sea Saw Restaurant. Teeter House feels like a cozy home with separate seating areas and a 4-seater bar shared between a full alcohol bar and Nobuo's prep area.   We sat at the bar right in front of Nobuo and were entertained the whole night by his artistic preparation of what I would call new-style sashimi, along the same vein as what Crudo is doing in Scottsdale - small plates of fresh raw seafood dressed with flavored oils and local in-season fruits and vegetables. Each dish excited the palate with creative combinations of flavors, textures and temperatures, such as the Hirame Carpaccio topped with hot sesame oil at the table.  Unfortunately we missed the other side of the menu and will have to wait until next time to try the warm dishes. Although based on the mizuyokan we had for dessert, I am sure the kitchen puts out equally excellent food. The mizuyokan, a red bean pastry held together by gelatin or agar agar, had a velvety texture (a little firmer than panna cotta) and a perfect level of sweetness (less sweet than the cloyingly sweet versions I've had in Japan).  The restaurant is located right across from fellow James Beard award-winner Chris Bianco's pizzeria and open everyday except Monday for lunch and dinner.

Mom and pop restaurants serving authentic Cantonese food is fast facing extinction in the Valley.  After Lucky's on the West side sold to a new owner who decided to Americanize the menu, HK Asian Diner's chef probably cooks the best Cantonese food in the Valley IMHO.  Hurry in before this family decides to sell or retire like New Hong Kong on Indian School in Phoenix is imminently doing. Ask for the authentic menu - don't worry it's in English. If you prefer Northern Chinese food, then you can rejoice in the proliferation of restaurants that have opened recently, like Dinghao, Nanzhou and BJ's in Chandler and Mesa.  I expect this trend to continue where Northern Chinese restaurants continue to proliferate while Cantonese restaurants disappear, as a result of the changing Chinese population, especially students that are coming to Arizona.

4 stars for the delicious sandwich we took to go.  Can't give it 5 stars until we actually eat here.  We had the brown sugar jerked pork with sweet red pepper and jicama slaw, watercress & smoked gouda on toasted ciabatta $11.  A bit pricey for a take-out sandwich.  The filling was generous and tasty with a nice balance of flavors and textures.  The place is cute and service was very friendly.

Glad not to have to drive too far out of Scottsdale for authentic Mexican shaved ice treats. The Chamoyada reminds me of a Bloody Mary on ice - salty, spicy and sweet! Perfect way to cool down on a hot day.
