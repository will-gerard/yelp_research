This is Safeway's local 'urban footprint' store - a mere half acre under roof with a tiny 9/10 acre parking lot in front.   They even have a useless bicycle stand jammed up against their back fence - useless because you can't fit any size wheel base between the rack and the fence it's jammed up against.  They used to know how to design urban footprint stores - there's a building still used as a grocery store that started life 80 years ago as one of the first Safeways - at 10th Street and Pierce - only 1 mile away.

I can think of nothing that needs improvement.  I think I've found my downtown replacement for Sportmans - something I thought downtown was currently incapable of.  Except they don't sell cigars ... I can forgive them don't smoke 'em anyway.  Wine and cheese selection - excellent.   Risotto - excellent Menu - intriguing knowledgeable wait staff - check Interesting events - yeppers

Thank you Marshall Shore for letting us know about this place!  We were a party of nine for Easter dinner last night - we filled the diner itself and ordered 1 of everything on the menu [2 of certain items].  There were 10 dinner items and 4 dessert items.  We passed the dishes down the counter to each other.  The menu is strictly vegetarian, but Payton keeps a few meat items available for hard core meaties - like my daughter and I who shared a heavenly fettuccine bolognese.  Each dish was superb.  I have a really hard time deciding on a favorite, but I think I'll go with the Fava and Steuben beans served in agave nectar with a walnut pesto.  My wife and daughter are going with the Beluga lentils, parsley and celery leaf.  We had a tasting menu [no pairing] I would have been happy to pay $75 for and we got away with $20.  Unbelievable.

This place is DEFINITELY NOT CLOSED. I loved it when Sloane Mcfarland was cooking there after getting it back to [almost] original condition and was ecstatic to find out this weekend that it's now a pop up restaurant.

Well, it finally got rented out again - to a troupe of really enthusiastic chefs and they're growing their hours. Worthy successors to the chefs who came before them, another tribe of locavores. Unbelievable that they seem to have a full beer/wine/liquor license.   GO NOW before everyone figures it out! However, be warned it is no longer "cheap, under $10" - but not by much - excluding our wine our shared meal clocked in at $15 each.  We each had a glass of Arizona wine labeled, merely, "red". Went wonderfully with our shared Roosevelt Growhouse salad [the beets, my gawd], cheeseburger [the mushrooms ...] and fries. Good decision, to share - we couldn't

This neighborhood branch library has been updated. It opens onto the street not the back of the parking lot now. It has a charming little outdoor walled nook to read on days it's not too hot - a wonderful touch. The update devotes roughly 2/3 of the space to Internet access or social gathering spots - one each for children, teens, and a space that can be used for meetings or watching film or presentations in a group.   Book/dvd stacks are a small fraction of the space now - you can access the system-wide inventory digitally and request an item be sent to this branch.   The place was packed at 3PM on a recent Wednesday with all sorts of ages and ethnicities.   Thinking about the changes as compared to the libraries I grew up with, I was reminded of the American Public Library system's founder, Andrew Carnegie, and why he gave his Bill Gates-sized fortune to create the library system - to allow those who are don't have the resources a place to learn for free so they can move up the social ladder - just as he did - although he had to pay for it as a desperately poor ghetto child in the for-profit libraries of his time.  I'm glad that basic principle remains in place, even though the physical books have become largely irrelevant.

So they now have the entire building and a dinner menu.  Alcohol license pending.  Now is the time to sneak in for some of the best food in the Valley.  We went 3:30PM Friday,   -wild arugula salad with roasted beets, goat cheese and toasted pecans -pizza margarita -roast pig, she apologized that it had just come out of the overn and was resting for 10 minutes.  Absolute heaven.  We left at 5PM Friday, still almost empty place.  I must be in bizarro world.  I wish my budget allowed me to eat there every day until the alcohol license arrives.  Or bizarro world stays put.

I'm sorry. On a few levels. Needed a breakfast place in the area yesterday and went with Yelp. This is the first time I've been disappointed. with Yelp consensus reviews.   I love Jewish delis and have learned to "settle" in Phoenix.   But I'll never settle for Eggs Benedict on a bagel with a slice of Kraft American Process Cheeselike Food Product between the deli ham and the poached egg.  Don't offer something if all you're going to do is mortally insult it's memory!  The coffee at least is the swill I grew up with B.S. [Before Starbucks} - just like I remember in Jewish delis and everywhere for that matter - but that's another rant altogether.   Meh-be the lox is good. Meh-be the good corned beef is piled sky high. I'll probably never find out.

Everyone here is a caring professional. I have never had such painless novocaine injections.   The dentists, Rosen and Arak, are always upbeat. The only staff member who left in the 11 years I've been coming here retired.   Everyone who works here loves to come to work.   For the first time in my life, I don't mind going to the dentist.   I can't think of anything that is a greater testimony to the quality of this dental practice.

You only know how good a service is when things go wrong.   I am terrified of using dog groomers to cut those annoying little toenails - walking wounded have staggered out of these places so often I sometimes wonder if I'll be charged with animal abuse as their owner. The opposite is true here. We've got an extremely persnickety faux min pin whose nails could have been done by a pedicurist to the stars!   And caring? Let me tell ya - I was forced to wait 5 whole minutes to pick up my darling today because a groomer was on the phone with a dog owner, holding a towel-enwrapped shivering little dust mote of a dog maternally to her breast while patiently explaining that the owner's precious freaked out, couldn't be blow-dried and freaked even worse at going into the kennel. So the groomer was ordered to stop all work, charge the owner only for a bath, convince the owner to pick her dog up, and personally hold the dog until the owner arrived.   I now know just how exemplary this grooming station is.   I heartily recommend it to every dog owner in this city.

Happened to be bicycling by the larger digs yesterday at 6PM and  there was no line. There also is no entrance from the parking lot - people have to walk around to the street to get in the place. I would love them if the perfection stopped right there as long as the food wasn't poisonous.  But then, wonderfully funky interior design in an old commercial space, top notch staff, perfectly fried drumsticks, wonderfully textured fresh waffles, excellent okra and greens, really good lemonade and thou beside me looking at Carlos Rivas' rooster. Bicycling home at sunset.   What more can be asked of life?

I needed to get my ponytail chopped off about 7 years ago to look more "corporate" for a new day job. Asked all around central valley - and was referred to Krista - who's now been at Salon Tru for 3-4 years.   Krista -who just made my 18 year old daughter very happy after a friend's poor coloring choice- has richly earned my undying loyalty over the years, and I've come to accept her judgment in moving to Tru.   The admin staff are normally very gracious and fully competent - and the boorish are soon moved out [every stylist there is an entrepreneur and won't tolerate poor service for their own customers]. The same for myopically selfish stylists.   Although the space could use an update, it's clean and the atmosphere is professional.   If your stylist hasn't made the smart choice to move up and into Tru you could probably find a good one there on your own.  Free street parking isn't usually a problem.

This vegan place is two things - simply delicious and totally casual.  They also rigidly adhere to their stated closing times - so you need to get there well before.  We  eat there at least once a month and with all the guests we've brought and our wanderings around the menu can state nothing is bad.  Of course you'll develop your own favorites.

It must be as good as it gets - I've never been able to get in the place and after getting blind drunk at their wine bar twice while waiting I gave up trying.  Been to some of Signor Bianco's other places though - as they say in NYC, I'd go back ...

I am horribly insensitive.  I've been loving Lux for over a decade and never wrote a review?!@?  Anyway, it changed hands and even changed locations [across the walkway] a few months ago.  The coffee, while no longer the best this side of Flagstaff is still really good and the home made whipped cream is always delicious.  A prior reviewer lamented that it turned its back to the street and is now open only to the rear parking lot.  In Phoenix-speak that is a betrayal of right-thinking anti-sprawlism. I agree.  Maybe a small point, maybe not.  It has a menu now!  The food keeps to the same standards as the pastries and beverages, which probably explains why there's almost always a line at the counter and rarely a 4-top available.  One thing this place has always had is a distinct personality, which changes in a big way with new ownership and many little ways with staff.  I've always loved that about it.

I get from prior reviewers that the Happy Hour specials are what the 4th star, essentially, is for - otherwise it'd be a solid 3.   I basically agree but ... I'm a sushi [ngiri] fan, and I find those prices to be very reasonable and the quality to be good. On the other hand, I've had much better salmon skin hand rolls in over half the sushi bars around the country I've ordered them -- I won't try them again here - they weren't crisped well enough for me and didn't have that lovely dressing so many good bars include inside.   I'm very happy with the dragon roll, shrimp tempura roll and spicy tuna roll - but only at the happy hour price. I wouldn't be caught dead paying suggested retail for them.   I quite liked the unfiltered sake.   The decor was interesting. I loved entering by walking on a fish pond! Service was prompt, knowledgeable and friendly.

Had some late afternoon meetings here this week and enjoyed the place.  It could use a bike rack, which actually isn't a quibble any more.  Had a baked brie-based appetizer one day and shared an antipasto the next.  Roasted peppers and sun dried tomatos - delicious.  Breads - very good.  Pesto - rich.  Service - attentive, allowed us to linger for hours during the 'tween time.  Another non-quibble - the coffee is boring.  Overall Carlys deserves fan-hood based on these two experiences.

I can't believe I've been shopping here this entire century and haven't written a review - well timed at least - this is my 100th.  First and foremost - they make their own yogurt and labneh. Secondly, the spinach and herb mixture in their spinach pies is the best this side of lower Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. Now that I think of it, several brands in here I haven't seen since Brooklyn.  Their fresh produce section is big, varied, and fresh. They butcher their own meat.  They have an excellent selection of honeys, herbs, spices, olives and flat breads.   Best of all, on many Saturdays, I find I'm the only native English speaker in the place.

I had been coming here since it seems like 2003 or so and for 4 years or so had been consistently delighted with the food - they were always too-crowded and service/wait times consistently showed that strain.   I've stopped coming here - preparation and ingredient quality have diminished steadily since late 2007 and crossed a boundary for me by November 2008

I don't get to the U.K. often enough, so this place is a bit o' for me: just enough $$ spent on keeping the inspector from shutting the place down, the rest of the hard-earned margin goes into the owners' pockets.   I have no idea what this long sliver of a place used to be, but it's become heaven for publovers since - a bar that stretches all the way east to Apache Junction with barstools stretching all the way back to the Flintstones, and teensy little 2fer tablet-tables squeezed into the longwall across.   Seemingly dozens of line cooks doubling as servers, seemingly dozens of taps serving wonderful fermented grains, and the meat, fish and veggie pies - my island ancestors never had it so good!

If only there were a true daily farmers' market closer.  But since there isn't Sprouts is my daily "go to" grocery store.    I glanced at Tyger's review and ditto it - there are reasons I have 2 regular alternatives - which get a proportionate share of my spending - Trader Joe's [psylium-something I used to supplement my horses with!] and Sunflower [Meyer's lavender dish soap and actually tasty rotisserie chicken].  Otherwise, I get most staples and much produce here - they stock the best quality and variety this side of Urban Grocery and Wine Bar.

We got Christmas dinner here for an excellent price; the mashed potatoes were delicious, the cranberry whatever was very good, turkey eminently serviceable and allowed me to make my own gravy.  Why are commercially prepared gravies always so horrid?  Otherwise, I've taken to getting their whole beans as an 'offprice' alternative to the micro roasters around town.

Stopped by for the second time yesterday on my way back home from evening errands - got a sandwich to share with my wife. Place was packed with people from 3 - 70 years old, originally- and trans-gendered, all shades of pink and brown, spread over every table inside and in both front and back patios, the three staff and proprietrix all running flat out, having a chance to catch up with a few visual and literary art friends while waiting.. There were two moms sitting across from me trying to shepherd 3 teensy ninas bursting with curiosity and energy who had me exploding in belly laughs by the time my takeout was ready - climbing up and over the couch, scrambling over the cookies on the plate, playing hide and seek with each other behind the legs of customers waiting to order, running in too many directions for the moms to follow, so one burst behind the counter as a staff member was finishing prepping her baby bottle. I suddenly realized I've been coming to this neighborhood social center across 3 decades now and never reviewed it before ... I love living where I do

I saw the reviews before me when preparing my own. Yikes! I can only assume there's new management now.   I brought my car in for a whatever-mile tuneup. They did a quick check before bringing it into the service bay, found out they were out of stock for my model's oil filter, asked me to come back in 2 days when their reorder was scheduled to arrive.   I told them I needed fluid levels checked now, and would return in a few days to complete the checkup.   They topped up coolant and oil at no charge within 5 minutes, and said they hoped I'd come back when the filters were in.   I'm going back this week - the filters are in - and will update this review for better or worse as things fall out.   But for now, I'm a fan.

I walked here from Tempe Center for the Arts for a coffee during a break in the dress reharsal for Breaking Ground this weekend.  Very comfortable vibe, engaging barristas.  Truly excellent coffee.  I wish there were a place to sit outside though.  Instead, I drank mine while walking back to TCA.  Don't get to do that often enough in this Valley.  I'll be back to Cartel whenever I want sit-in coffee.

We've been here a few times for dinner - never disappointed. The last time we went with a party of 8 on a First Friday - they allowed us to scatter ourselves until an 8-top could be constructed.   One of our party was a newcomer to the valley from Harlem who was a cruise organizer to Jamaica - an aficionado in other words. He came away impressed with the authenticity and variety.

Their rum bar has now been open a while and flights are available.  I was never a rum aficionado - too many rum n cokes when I was too young to care about such things - and have now discovered a whole new world.  The food has become nothing short of spectacular.    The ambiance - from the inside I can pretend I'm in the West Village circa 1975 by Greenwich and Horatio.  Doesn't get any better than that.

The place closed a short time after this review  If I lived next door I would probably show up from time to time - although there are several far better choices within 2 blocks [Carley's, Verde, Matt's, Portland's - many more if you're willing to go one more block].  Went for lunch with my 18 year old daughter around 2:30PM on a weekday. No one there except 3 employees - who stayed in earnest discussion with each other as we entered and walked through the place. My daughter wanted to walk out - she felt like we were intruding. I even asked whether they were closed between meals.   It did feel as though we were intruding the entire time we were there. I had to ask for silverware and napkins even after being served drinks and, later, sandwiches. The servers were certainly NOT recruited for their professionalism. One woman walked in, looked over the visible fare, sauntered over to the counter and read the chalkboard menu for a few minutes. Not once was her presence acknowledged. She sauntered out.   Food quality? Mine was good - albacore tuna, fresh tomato and lettuce, good bread. But Lays potato chips? c'mon... My daughter had "southwestern" turkey - the turkey was real, but she couldn't understand why it was called southwestern - we decided that must've been some kind of code for "raised in the southwest".   Service? Abysmal. Not snooty. Just sort of nonexistent.   I had wanted to sample dinner sometime. I still might, but now only out of a sense of obligation to downtown.  Parking- they have a teensy private lot [this is a re-purposed building - this is it's first consumer retail use in at least 15 years]; parking used to be sufficient for business-to-business uses. There's some street parking available.

Raunchy adult satire is the norm here by some of the best 'not ready for prime time' people in the southwest.  Intimate, funky space reminds me of the '80s lower east side in NYC or '90s DUMBO.  A rite of passage at a minimum, and a savory delicacy for initiates.

They're starting entrees and will start lunches soon. We had several superb tapas; the entree was excellent, as was the organic sake.   My only quibble would be the quail tapas - but then again I've never been a particular fan of Peking Duck - it needs the hoisin sauce to be decent.   Service is excellent.

5 stars if the place would stand out anywhere - it would.  Many adaptive re-uses to get to today and a wonderfully comfortable "little plate" restaurant where you can dine bench-style and meet strangers if you're so inclined.  It served as a postal credit union and traveling carnival workers union safe house among its prior incarnations...  The chef is an artist and the prices absurdly low.  We stopped in for a light dinner at 9PM on a Saturday night - and were the next in line.  Many of the diners had biked there - the long bike rack was jammed,  Several people after us enjoyed the living room waiting room, others the big screen TV at the bar while awaiting a table.  Three of us - ordered 2 small plates and the sharing special.  It was just enough - any more and we would've been too stuffed.  11 bucks each before tip.  Toasted baguette covering melted brie and walnuts, accompanied by shaved veggie crisps, potatoes and parsnips frites accompanied by mushroom soup [they called it gravy but that implies flour and fat], pork and beef ravioli in a heavenly roasted tomato sauce.  Finished with chocolate chip cookie dough balls - desserts were sold out.  I could eat here every day...

I don't get to Chandler much living in Central Phoenix, and was amazed at how its downtown has changed the past 12 years. And yet Chandler has managed to keep some 30-40-something year old commercial buildings from getting bulldozed long enough for Gangplank to colonize them. Good work! There's enough fever-dream post-proto-modernist glass bead games going on over the past decade out there already. But they do have some cool bus stops.   Anyway, back to gangplank - a gaggle of geeks renting seemingly true brick construction, onsite carpentered roof trussed nondescript commercial boxes that must've housed companies bankrupted by Home Depot and Walmart decades ago now repurposed for a cadre of self employed graphic design- and webheads.   And growing - Tyler, chief webhead told me they're gonna take over 260 S Arizona as a conference center.   Keep taking over those ancient buildings guys - downtown Chandler needs to remember what it was way back in the disco era!   Seriously though, this is a wonderful thing happening in too few places around the Valley - saving disposable buildings from being bulldozed off to the landfill and re-using them as incubators for creative entrepreneurs almost as young as the buildings themselves.

Two of us came for brunch on Art Detour Saturday. We had sides only - the slow-roasted pulled pork, ditto lamb, and braised greens. That is precisely what these dishes consisted of - no embellishments. They were delicious and filling and the service was friendly and excellent. We're going back soon to sample the pasta.   They intend to market themselves to the employed community for weekday lunch. I hope they do - it will increase their chances of survival.

Four for dinner on a First Friday - this is the third restaurant in a building with three and the only one not on the street - it shows. Sens and Turf had people spilling out of them - Pasta Bar was half full at best - an inadvertent lucky break - they had only one waitperson - who did a creditable job in my opinion. Insalata caprese, braised greens, desert sweet shrimp, pasta carbonara, ricotta cheese gnocchi and a pasta with fennel sausage. I haven't had such good carbonara since I lived in Queens [NYC].  All well worth the price and the waitperson delivered them timely. However, I remain skeptical about their survival - not enough traffic on what should be a blowout night - and wonder if they'll share the fate of Palette.

... as always, 5 stars if the place would stand up anywhere. It would.   Firstly, I'm overjoyed it survived these past few years. Secondly, on a regular Saturday night 8:30-ish, it was 40% full - and in-line with it's 2 street-facing co-tenants. That's hopefully enough to ensure survival. These 3 delightful restaurant/bars have carved out a wonderful second life for the industrial building they're housed in and provide a luxury of urbanity to this burg.   We had to scoot in for a quick small supper before going to a comedy show a friend was in. Small check quickly and un-resentfully served - thank you gracious server!   There was a single man drinking a coke and eating a bowl of pasta at the bar while diligently reading his book. It was clear he felt abundantly welcomed. That tableau epitomizes the civilized urbane establishment this place is.   The pasta carbonara remains true after two years to the unremittingly high standard set for me by a Queens neighborhood Italian joint decades ago - and Pasta Bar remains the only other place I've ever ordered it more than once. For that, and so much more, I'm eternally grateful.

I've deeply enjoyed Anna's stall at the downtown farmers' market and am delighted to [belatedly] learn she finally opened her cafe.  We went yesterday and had specials - a libation of gazpacho with beet instead of tomato as a base [surprisingly delicious and thirst quenching] - her filling take on a Spanish omelette and a pasta dish garnished with carmelized onion, bleu cheese and crushed walnut - again suprisingly delicious.  A word traveler who has mashed diverse sampled cuisines with a taste for what's good - Phoenix is a richer place for her sojourn here.

5 Stars if the place would stand up anywhere. It would.   1- It "melds" well with the funky-hip urban "vibe" of the Clarendon Hotel - something prior entrepreneurs didn't do as effectively.   2- Both the chef and the "bottle hunter" are experts who live and breathe what they love - cooking and curating alcohol. It shows.   For instance: There was a Scottish whiskey I fell in love with during the '90s I haven't seen in a while -single malt aged in charred port casks, wonderfully smooth and india-ink black in color- and mis-remembered its label - ordering that label at Gallo Blanco. When I protested and described the scotch I had hoped for, the bottle hunter came over to apologize [for my own ignorance?-unnecssary but wonderfully gracious of him] and explain the whiskey I wanted stopped production over a decade ago because it's color never found market acceptance. How many people would have that at their fingertips?   What to eat? Anything! It's all locally-sourced prepared by food artists! My own obsessive choice is Chilaquiles Verdes - heavenly green chile sauce poured over free-range perfectly roasted chicken topped with delicious shredded cheese and free-range eggs sunnyside up - a breakfast they serve all day and night. I hit that my 5th visit and it's kept me from sampling the entire menu so far...but I've nibbled on my companions' choices.   ...And then there's the rooftop lounge. But that's for another night.

I am horrified it took me so long to review this - it took me a few months to track down Chris Porter's new place last year.  Having found it, I took my wife there for her birthday in early January, 2010.  Not the extravaganza of the old Tapino.  But the gastronomic delights didn't diminish in the slightest.  The old homestead is perfectly suited to the simpler menu.  To paraphrase a Hannibal Lecter line [another gastronome, come to think of it], our world is a richer place for Chris Porter's continued presence in it.

I am a fan of this place because of the beliefs of its co-owner, Michelle and the staff.  I discovered Black Pearl Poetry at this place; they made themselves available for a natural hair meetup and kept themselves open until 9:30PM on a non-school Saturday night so that Phonetic Spit could have a fundraiser in the subterranean plaza.   This place lives its 'fair trade' philosophy.  They now have a liquor license. I hope that will allow them a great spike in revenue and hours of operation.  Now, if they could improve the taste of that fair trade coffee ...

Get Your PHX got me here for my second visit yesterday and I'm glad they did!  Two months ago they built a bar in the place, serving craft beer and select wine.  They'll soon have a full dinner menu as well.  We packed the house for a free wine pairing [I know it's a small business and know how much Virginia Senior, proprietress sacrificed] on their regular 'BU Thursday' wine pairing event - a mere $15 normally.  Virginia, at least for me, your sacrifice will not have been in vain - you've secured 2 new regular customers!  The sommelier's discernment shined brightly and the chef's pairing choices were competent and then some - I rarely get the 'frisson' I experienced in the Queso Manchego paired with the 2008 Edge Cabernet.  You won't regret showing up next Thursday for their weekly wine pairing.

This little market has true spirit!  We've found ourselves near it 4 times in the past 3 weeks for various unrelated reasons just before returning home and decided to drop in for the 'bottle of milk / loaf of bread' errand.  They're open until 11PM some nights.  They have food trucks some nights.  The staff are all wonderful. The variety is admirable for such a small store.   I wish I lived close enough to shop there regularly.  I have to manufacture excuses to be in that neighborhood more often just before heading home - like tonight for instance : )  See you there soon I hope!

I am in love with what this place has become! It used to be an eyeglass grinding factory [my older brother in law tells me that was his first job out of high school] and now you can meet your graphic design firm, buy your funky [or Bunky?] vintage ensemble and get a great baked-egg and prosciutto breakfast with your delicious caffeinated beverage, all without braving the shaded sidewalk!   Use your plastic to pay for breakfast - you just have to gesture your signature on their wi fi iPad.  Have your business meeting, do your homework, or just people watch.   For hours like I did the other day, they don't mind [yet].   I guess THIS is why they don't bulldoze good old buildings ...

Cindy Gentry has created a large part of her dream here and with the outdoor market. Many Phoenicians' dreams have been wonderfully fulfilled as well - I can tell - the aisles are becoming too narrow.  It keeps getting better - the chefs, the selection, the support. Our meals at home are increasingly prepared exclusively from local ethically created ingredients found at these two dreamlands...   Now will someone please step up and make yogurt locally?!?   Which reminds me - my CSM card promises me a discount this week on CRAVE ice cream - but 4 reviews said it's no longer carried? What gives?

I don't do 5 stars too often - only when the place would stand out no matter where it is.  Such is the case here - personally expressive design with an excellent  "eye" [gosh I wonder if the proprietor...?], beans selected and roasted with perfection, knowledgeable, personable competent staff ... and almost-best of all I can buy the beans whole.   Now, if only they could bring Flagstaff weather here as well - at least in the summer...

There are very few places I can wander into and meet people I know well, each from a different personal life zone of mine.  Lola on Roosevelt is one of them.  A true "3rd place" I suppose - especially since I live over 6 miles away.  The coffee is chosen, roasted, ground and cooked with the obsessive passion that we've known and loved the past 10 years at all 4 "3rd places" - Lux, Lola Tapas, Lola on Central and now here.  The barristas are elegantly poised professionals who can handle crowd "spikes" calmly and rapidly - a very rare and precious talent [why is it done in these places so consistently?].  The confections have always been excellent - I wish the grains weren't so highly refined is my only quibble there.    The old building is just perfect!  What they've done to it makes the space achingly exquisite.  And comfortable.  And comfortingly urbane.  I wish I lived next door.

They're doing preview nights ahead of their grand opening in a few weeks.  $5 for the show - you can't go wrong!  We saw 3 improv groups Saturday night featuring 15 or so actors.  Very accomplished and very entertaining.  They offer improv classes and a 'teaser' class to get your feet wet.  I'm seriously considering being there the next one - Tue July 5.

Again, 5 stars if this could thrive anywhere.   Erin, a prior reviewer, said she didn't go to a place called "Sportsmans" - the image of a sports bar kept me out of here for 7 years after I moved into the area - until I was searching for a good place for Spatlese the 1st Thanksgiving I was cooking for my new family. I almost didn't go here then except, well, for the great Yelp reviews.   They have the excellent sense to use Tarbell's mozzarella for their Caprese.   They have the choicest and least expensive wine-friendly cheese selection I've seen in the valley.   Their sommeliers and bottle hunters are felicitously courteous passionate experts - I know, I've challenged them for pairing ideas and then "blind" taste-tested them against other recommendations at my dinner parties - their selections always draw the raves, others' the mumbles.   I just wish I'd been "sportsman" enough to venture in 7 years earlier!

When 2 unrelated people, in 1 week, both independently demanded that each of their business meetings with me happen at Echo Coffee, that's gotta be a "5"!  When, during each meeting, people I know from completely different "worlds" [scattered across the Valley] came in for their own coffee and/or meetings, that catapaulted Echo into the Lola or Cartel.  The coffee stood the test excellently, as did the atmosphere.

The one-star review is for 1-thing only and will hopefully be removed.  We'll see.  The 1-thing?  Abominable customer service.  Here goes:  I was having a horridly difficult day yesterday with meetings scattered around the Valley  starting late difficult traffic  arrived at my 3PM at Echo at 2:55PM, waiting on line 7 minutes before I could order. At 3:02PM I asked for a coffee and sandwich (I hadn't eaten anything since a quick 7AM scoop of oatmeal and was famished). I was told the kitchen closed at 3PM and they would not consider making a sandwich.  They offered me pastries from the front counter.  That does not a lunch make.  I declined, got my coffee and had my meeting. I didn't eat until I got home at 6PM. They hadn't closed the kitchen door when they refused to make a sandwich and I could see all of the ingredients sitting on the kitchen's work counter. I didn't take issue with the young woman who stridently advised me a sandwich was impossible.  I don't argue with subordinate staff who are presumably only following orders.  No one senior to her was in evidence.  I will simply avoid scheduling meetings at Echo and try to persuade people who want to meet there to meet somewhere else.  When I have clear and abundant evidence this customer service standard has been vaporized I will return.  And change this 1-star rating.

The best drip coffee I have ever had in Phoenix - I actually drink it black no sugar. I normally don't bother with drip coffee out - because I love my fresh ground Cartel coffee slowly filtered through my melitta at home too much.  Delightful pastries - which I can almost never say about egg and dairy free confections.  Alice in Wonderland stuff. Without the enhancements Lewis Carroll had.

Open 24 hours through the weekend, until midnight otherwise. Downtown is starting to have a life.  Early 20th Century bungalow, as all these funky businesses on this block. Across the street tonight was an excellent jazz guitarist plucking away, alone, lost in his music, in a front yard ...  The savory and sweet crepes just keep getting better, and I finally made it last Sunday to the brunch - the best light pancakes I've tasted in years served with real maple syrup and exquisite Schreiner's sausage. Nibbled over two hours of unending visits and great  Beirut-style cafe banter from downtown's notables.  Life is good.

I hate burgers.  I eat ground bison at home, and need something close to a michelin star to order one out.  Must've been the really limpid house red that relaxed me, but I ordered a burger here - and enjoyed it.  Fries too!  So, bar food can be really good at a neighborhood place.  Strangely, there are a few places with this name scattered around the Valley.  I wonder ... ?  I had no idea what to expect from this location, and was further confused by an invitation to attend a "strategy session" there last night - I thought maybe some sort of laid back coffee house?  But at the old Trente Cinq?  Well, a standard, albeit well done, neighborhood watering hole in front, DJ, sport game on the TV, that sort of thing.  Very comfortable living room in back - a lovely way to have a chat, drink and burger.  That is, if the DJ can be convinced to turn the back room music down.  Which is what our velvet-gloved tigress of a meeting arranger accomplished, sort of.  Eventually.  The likes of Applebees nailed these details a long time ago.  It isn't inventing a new tubular rolling thing any more.  Even 20 somethings sometimes want a softer ambiance.   Why 4 stars, given the above quibbles?  Good ambiance, good wine, good burger [this coming from me] and really great, friendly service; even a DJ who eventually listens to a group of 20 customers out back.  If I lived in this neighborhood it'd be one of my staples.  Who knows?  I might move to it.

We finally made it Becketts Table - for Easter supper.  Everything had powerful but appropriate taste and texture [where that makes any sense] from the lemonade all the way through the meal.  The flavor additions to each food enhanced rather than detracted [from] the inherent flavor of the food.   Wife had steamed bass - delicate enhancements; my daughter, the burger - smokey wood flame-broiled - a strong enhancement; the appetizer - briefly-roasted feta cheese had also briefly-roasted purple sage leaves, fire-dried heirloom tomatoes, roasted garlic cloves and peppers with a minimum of capsaicin which all conspired to adroitly enhance the somewhat delicate feta. I had pork osso buco which needed and received next to nothing, and never lifted a knife.  Delicious in my opinion.

90-ish year old small house turned into a wonderfully inviting small restaurant.  We weren't too hungry so shared 3 appetizers - a smoked salmon spring roll, firecracker shrimp and crispy calamari, and finished sharing a ginger creme brulee.  Everything delicious - even the geezers sitting at the next table cackling over an Arpaio-inspired silent auction of pink underwear while we watched Ireland and Estonia square off in a soccer match from the bar.  Only in a city.  It's nice that downtown is starting to feel like one.

Had a light brunch there today after the Farmer's Market - our first chance to stop by since it opened a few days ago.  -Attentive unobtrusive service.  From day one - no small feat.  -Stark Japanese flavor to the ambiance: dark wood and stone horizontals massed monochrome walls softened by dessicated organics on surfaces and hanging from the ceiling and a few monochromatic illustrations on one wall.  Pleasing but as a prior reviewer noted, somewhat cold.  We ate at what seemed to be a cork-topped table.  -Amazed at the reasonable prices.  Green lentil soup with a dollop of yogurt, mixed vegetables in sherry, pork belly hash, shrmp over grits and manchego.  All local, all delicious set us back less than $25.  -And the thing that ripped the 5th star off - Starbucks coffee.  With one of the best micro-roasters I've tasted just 2 blocks north at Royal [and a gaggle  of excellent ones within 2 miles nowadays] they couldn't go local with the caffeine roastery?

Never thought I'd downgrade my rating to such a low point for this restaurant. But, among other difficulties, their soup tasted like what I made as a college freshman my first time making something from hot water vegetables and a chicken leg - and then added a grotesque volume of pepper because it didn't taste like anything - that is what I overpaid for here. Fried okra tasted like something I used to get from a grocery store frozen foods bin and microwave until it was crispy, the ranch dressing tasted like some bottled slop I used to get in the '80s, the burger bun was white gluten glop and the burger boring.  We got a card with our check asking for our contact info so we can get bombarded with 'social media'.Instead of giving up all our contact info, we simply wrote "see our yelp reveiw".   What saved this from a 1-star was the wait staff - friendly attentive and on-time.

We got here as part of the Calle 16 Jane's Walk last Sunday, and my 18 year-old daughter's eyes just lit up.  To make that happen nowadays takes something very special.  They have work by some of the original artists of Art Detour on up to hand made fashions by designers just starting out.  She got a painted Band Aid box from back in the day ...  Eclectic aesthetic by the people who are repurposing this '50s era insurance agency building - the architect-owner offices out of the old vault [originally used to store vital insurance documents in the pre digital age].  They let their designers do street art on the front street walls, thus joining the multicultural muralistas all up and down Calle Dieciseis.

Simply the best ice cream I have ever tasted.  The fruit flavors are unbelievable.  I may find a place to own next door just so I can walk over any time - perhaps I should say all the time - on 2nd thought maybe I should move to the other side of the world.  This addiction could get worse than crack!

We walked a mile from our home to get here last Sunday.  I won't do that again until cooler weather prevails, but I will bike there during the crucial 24 hours each week it's open while the Public Market is closed - especially Sundays and Mondays.  It's kinda reminiscent of Dean & DeLuca in NYC and so, majorly draws me to it.  The presence of Meyer's dish soap doesn't hurt.  I'll be a regular - at least until the Public Market creates Sunday/Monday hours.  I have no idea how it intends to survive so far from residents on the weekends.

A good chiropractor is hard to find, and for 15 years as I moved across this Valley I drove wherever necessary to keep the one I found back when.  Which is why I was overjoyed to stumble into Natalie Bustamante while wandering around the too-few delightful 19th Century homes when I first moved downtown.  I'd probably still own a car if it weren't for her ...   BTW  this 1895 cottage houses a chiropractor, two masseuses, a downtown publisher, one of the most prominent muralistas in the Valley and a snug little contemporary art gallery. I'm waiting for the sushi bar but not holding my breath as it were.

We took my wife out for Mother's Day here.  There were 6 diners at 2 tables beside us. I notice from other reviews that is not uncommon.    We found the food to be delicious [roasted eggplant, oregano chicken, caprese sandwich, a glass of malbec]; the server was knowledgeable, courteous and professional.  She was also leaving in a week to work at Ajo Al's.  The place is designed well. Our small sampling of the fare indicates some of the food and wine issues addressed in previous reviews were fixed. Service and good employee retention issues may still need to be addressed.  I hope the place survives.  I look forward to being there many times in future.

Unbelievable - an ice cream shop open until 2AM in downtown Phoenix! Thank you Fair Trade Cafe for making your space available for this after hours experience.  The ice cream is very rich.  The waffle cones are tasty, but too brittle.  The flavors are solid.  Coffee and such remain available until 2AM too.  Starting to feel like a real city down here.

The Phoenix New Times winner of "Best After Hours Feast" last year, Navajo chef Renatto-Mario Etsitty landed in this location months ago, renamed it RezBot and launched his own particular fusion of Native American and contemporary suburban neo-mexican culinary taste.  My favorite offering is red bell pepper soup served with fry bread, second favorite is the blue corn chilaquiles, third the braised lamb shank stew. I stopped in last night to give Mario a slice of home made pecan pie I stole from an event at Parazol and found out he has a new lamb loin dish - yum!  His Aqua Fresca is to die for.  He also has quesadilla and burgers made from halal meat for those needing a Taco Bell or burger joint fix ...   BTW he's getting real tired of people wandering in thinking this is an Indian restaurant expecting to see curries and tandoori dishes ...

Personal 8 inch pies starting at six bucks baked and served within 10 minutes of ordering?  What could be better than that?  I know - that they're simply delicious!  They must've raided the best produce from every farmer's market in the Valley to get that earthy musty tang into their fungi variety and garlicky tomatoey basily frisson in their margharita-like variety.  That was all I could eat the first time last night on Roosevelt Row.  I've gotta get on their list - so I can eat my way through all their mouth watering fare!

I glanced across the street during Saturday morning's Farmers Market and almost dropped my reusable shopping bags, which would have spilled all that kale onto the tarmac [oops black asphalt parking lot] - Miami was open for business in the daylighted morning!  I've always loved how someone recognized the shape of the old lady's clothing store's windows for its possibility to germinate into a Lapidus Lincoln Road fantasy.  So I dropped in and had a competent coffee whipped up by the barrsta/day shift manager. She is resolutely sampling the wares of downtown's excellent micro roaster before settling on one.  Sipping and noshing at a sidewalk cafe between Van Buren and Roosevelt while the Farmers Market plays on across the street is deliciously ironic enough - I can't wait to do it mid day mid week!   Be a true urbanista trailblazer - do it too!

There once was a conceit built in the shadow of the Heard Estate - a New England long house, pool house and roadway store - on Vernon Avenue. The rambling buildings have been re-purposed over the decades, and the current incarnation includes a coffee shop at the old pool house.  Shine, well, shines at this location. Their pastries are starting to get baked very morning.   And they've got plans for this old pool house ...

This is what locally owned business is all about - in this case, an inspired husband-wife team.  You never know what cold micro brews will be available sourced across the globe - from day to day and from hour to hour. A keg finishes, they hook up a new keg and change the chalkboard listing. Always a surprise - a delightful, delicious surprise.  And the pub grub - best I've ever had anywhere. Full of surprises from a chef bursting with ideas. Fried egg to top off a flatbread pizza, pecan pie pop tarts, wild game sausage with condiments made in house daily ... perfect complements to the delicious offerings on tap.  Downtown might need to be a place to live - people might not want to drive home after sampling the riches on the streets down here!

It was good to see so many reviews from out of towners for this little solo restaurant. A rather large table of young Chinese tourists was seated during our visit for instance.  We biked down - no bike rack but was able to hook our bikes to the sidewalk fence.  Vietnam War era music, which created a certain ambiance to the place. Undeniable French influence on the menus which ditto. Low key contemporary bistro setting at the Hotel San Carlos.  Salmon Tartare, Cha Gio [a crispy pork spring roll] and Cognac Filet Mignon washed down with a good Cotes du Rhone set us back only $22 a head before tip.  My only quibble was the hot dog mustard accompanying the salmon.

So they have a barber there for people like me. Now I have a downtown chiro as well as a downtown barber.   Brit McCulley, originally from Wisconsin who biked in from Scottsdale until her bike got stolen last month.   A barber in the truly old-school sense of the word - keeps you entertained with informative conversation the whole time you're there.  She does shaves as well.  I wish the Salon would get a bike rack out front - I always have to hook it up to the fence surrounding the chainstore restaurant next door which, luckily, never has many people, so I haven't yet got shooed away.  When will chainstores learn to leave downtown alone?

They got a bike rack - glad I finally remembered to report it, now that I have something else to report - Fridays the proprietrix' spouse, who operates a pizza food truck using Persian flatbreads, delivers half a dozen pizzas free for staff and customers to eat. Looks like my hair will always need cutting on a mid day Friday from now on.

They are one day away from their First Friday 'hard' opening and this is the best they could do? Fifteen bucks for a burger and fries I've happily paid many times at many places, but here? Not so happy.  I was warned they have gotten off to a horrid start, but didn't want to believe that precious Scottsdale place can't figure out hipster downtown Phoenix.  I called when I got out of the Jeff Speck talk over by City Hall and got hung up on in the middle of asking whether they do takeout.  So I rode my bike there anyway to find out how supremely busy they must have been on a glorious Thursday night to hang up on a takeout order.  6 tables out of 22+ have guests, dealt with by two wait staff, with two other staff wandering around and two cooks on duty.  Two strikes already - but wait! It's goes on! The cashier was too busy to even speak with me for about 4 minutes. I never could figure out what she was doing.  So I ordered a cheeseburger from this "French Bakery" - note that is IS NOT a "Boulangerie" - with fries to go. She just looked at me and said "is that all?". I said "yes" and she looked disappointed. After a few seconds, she asked "Don't you want bacon and mushrooms?". I thought maybe saying "yes: might get the order processed. I was right. So I asked how long it would take. Was told "10 minutes". Which seemed slightly quick, even though nothing was being cooked in that moment.  So I came back 10 minutes later and sat around for 5 minutes, eventually noticing two little boxes over by the cashier, who was chatting away at another employee. So I waited 60 seconds before going over to find out whether the little boxes were my order. She stopped chatting long enough to put the boxes in a bag and hand the bag to me.  I've seen greasy spoon short order cooks fork a par-cooked hunk of meat out of some liquid slop and slap it on a grill. This burger tasted like that. I noticed a few little squiggles of something that could have been mushrooms, and a few flakes of something that could have been bacon bits.  I only had to bike 4 blocks home. The food was luke warm. At least the fries taste better lukewarm than McDonalds fries do.  But that re heated burger - not good. It does something to the texture of the meat.  There is serious competition in downtown Phoenix now. This place is not ready to succeed here.

Back in the day [about a month ago] when they were 'just' a food truck they were my Wednesday dinner at the downtown Farmers Market and alternate Fridays at the empty lot on Camelback.  Now I have to bike all the way 2 blocks north to their sit down restaurant to get my Wednesday fix.  Worth it. The only place I eat hot dogs in America.  What's up with the empty lot now? Who knows - who cares

Thank you downtown Phoenix and especially thank you Pizza People Pub!

Wow. Go now. For their food, not the luxurious surroundings. Dominican food that is, simply, delicious. Went there for lunch today - shrimp in garlic sauce. Perfection.   Sat next to a Dominican from New York who, having found out yesterday that today's special would be mashed plantains fasted until lunch so he could eat them with the necessary gusto. So will I the next time it's on special.  How many restaurants in your life have such a dish? Add this one to it.
