My gf is suffering through "shark week" and wanted pizza. I did take out and the pizza was ready when I got there letting me hurry home to the sea of hormones my bedroom was becoming. The pizza was shaped like the circle on a pentagram but still helped me keep the possibility of needing to perform an exorcism at bay. She was happy and sated, another night I keep all body parts and have a warm bed to sleep in.

I went through the drive through, it was quick. I ate cheap processed food that tastes the same as EVERY OTHER MCDONALDS! The fries were hot and not to salted, 4 stars.

On an excursion through middle eastern countries searching for a slightly used puzzlebox I was told of a small shop in none other than Tempe. I went looking for the gateway to a land of extreme pains and pleasures, instead I found pretty grand shisha prices. I have decided that between the excellent service and prices that I wont be looking for shisha elsewhere. Still looking for a puzzlebox and a girl with wires in her face and a leather fetish.

I have been recently searching for incense to cover up the smell of my dead mothe...I mean rodent problem at my small hotel. The voice told me to kill the young man behind the counter but the beautiful smells his incense pen made soothed the sounds of her voice. Her hounding, maniacal voice. I dont want to hurt anyone mom! Stop screaming at me! I left with multiple juices and a tank to hold them at a great price. They didnt even judge the flower dress I wore though they did give the knife I was holding second looks. The hotel smells amazing. I must go now, I need to check a shower running in one of my hotel rooms.

I was about to get on the lightrail when a homeless man asked for food. I went in and bought 2 grilled cheeses a bottled water and a lemonade, came to about 18 dollars. I gave him the water and a sandwich and ate the second myself. It was the most boring bland sandwich I have had in years. I was appalled that I gave some one else something so terrible to eat.
