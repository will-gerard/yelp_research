I read some reviews for the best pizza in AZ, and stumbled across this place, which is the closest to home.  My friend and I decided to man-date it here one night.  Got there right at the dinner rush to see this place severely under staffed.  I guess a bunch of the wait staff had called in.  We were seated promptly despite this and ordered up some of the venerated bread appetizer.  The bread was really good, i don't know if it warranted all the praise it gets but... its some pretty good bread.  I ordered the prosciutto pie and my friend ordered an eggplant parm pie (no idea how we are still friends).  They do have an interesting beer list, mostly international brews, but very good.  The prosciutto pizza was amazing; light, thin crispy.  Even the Eggplant Parmesan pizza was really good (Side Note: Eggplant Parm pizza was not good as a leftover. The eggplant turned into rubbery tires, not a problem from the restaurant, just a tip.)    Overall: great pizza, pretty good appetizers, good service.  But its pretty pricey.

I have eating at several Chinese places in the Chandler area.  This place is by FAR the best. Super fast delivery, excellent portions, and fresh ingredients.   I had Mongolian beef and my wife had an order of pot stickers and crab rangoons.  Everything was perfect super crisp green onions, nothing soggy.  The beef was real beef, not processed grey meat product.

Let me say this first, this is the best value car wash on the planet.  For $25, my car is immaculate.  They cleaned between the spokes on my wheels, they did an amazing job on the interior.  Truly 6 star worthy service.  The only reason i am docking points is that there is no building in which to wait for your car to be cleaned.  This means you have to sit in the shade outside and wait for your car.  No A/C or fans to keep you cool.  Minor annoyance, but today was real hot (108) so with no breeze in the shade its about 95.  I would rather deal with the heat than all of the upsales that happen at other car washes.    I will be taking all of my cars here from now on though.  Highly recommend.   Another note:  I saw cars there that had been detailed.  They looked better than new.  Everything from the undercarriage to brake calipers were spotless.  If i ever need my car detailed, i know where i will be taking it.

Let me start at the beginning.    My fiance and I were looking for places to get our groomsmen and I suits from, for our upcoming wedding.  We were going with a vintage look with suspenders and bow-ties and no jackets.  We heard that Jos. A Bank was an upscale formal retailer and rental with locations countrywide which would make it easier for the groomsmen.  We had a very pleasant visit at the San Tan location and ordered all of the pants, shirts, vest (for me), and shoes.  My soon-to-be wife was very pleased with the color palettes and their ability to piece together suit combinations.  The next month we receive a phone call informing us that the suit package we ordered is new and will not be in until April (wedding in February) and that we would have to choose another one.  This was fine, they informed us early and had options waiting for us.  I order the nearest color pants and vest and everything was smooth sailing.  After my bachelor party, I had all of my groomsmen get fitted together.  This was a month and a half before the wedding.  We went in to the Val Vista store and got fitted promptly.  Well, further bachelor party events were to take place later that day but I wanted us to get fitted together.  I did not expect it to take THREE HOURS!  We were measured in about 15 minutes.  But due to some cataclysmic system error, our wedding party was not found.  They re entered all of the information (essentially having to pick out the suits again) My best man and I stayed behind and let the other groomsmen continue on.   They finally just asked if we could leave a credit card for all of the deposits and they would fix it later.  I was extremely upset, which was later compounded by the fact that all my groomsmen received 15 separate emails from Jos.A Bank.    Four days before the wedding, I get a call from Jos.A Bank saying they do not have a suit for my one of my groomsmen (he had to get fitted in Utah) .  My groomsman informed me the day he got fitted (over a month ago at this point) and i had to call another store to verify that his suit was ordered and on its way.  The next day, two of my groomsmen went to pick up their suits.  Now is where it hits the fan, I had originally ordered slim fit pants, being that there was not jacket, and we wanted a very specific look.  The pants that arrived were more akin to 'Hammer Pants' than anything 'slim.'  The shirts were also supposed to be tailored fit, but were either too baggy or short in the sleeves.  I have no idea if this was a measurement error or what.  Apparently the new pants i had ordered after the original ones were not to come in, were not slim fit.  No one informed me of this at the time.  I had 72 hours to BUY ALL MY GROOMSMEN NEW PANTS! They had also messed up the groom's name, which caused all my groomsmen to panic when they were told by Jos.A Bank that the wedding was not in their system.    The nightmare did not end there.  The day of the wedding, after purchasing all new pants, and realizing we would have to wear the shirts from Jos, my best man and I went to pick up our suits.  This ordeal took about 15 min per suit as they charged us for renting the pants and then returned the cost immediately afterwards. (Side note: they were going to charge $88.00 + tax to RENT the pants in case you were wondering the price range of this place)   While on our way to the venue, other groomsmen called in to say they had got their suits (at this point we only rented white dress shirts, shoes, and cuff links) and shared their horror stories.  None of us paid the same amount.  There were $40.00 expedite shipping charges on some of our receipts (which Jos.A Bank agreed was wrong and refunded).  AVOID AT ALL COSTS. I am the first one of my friends to get married and NONE of them will be using Jos.A Bank.

I love me some BBQ.  I have had ribs, brisket, and pulled pork from across the land. I saw this little hole in the wall on the way to my friend's house, and had to try it.  I got their bbq sampler with their spicy sauce.  Their sauce was too sweet for my liking, but their brisket is out of this world.  Better brisket than i have gotten is Texas.  Pulled pork was about average, nothing that knocked your socks off, but it didn't disappoint.  The ribs were really good.  They were the right amount of tender without being mush.   The ribs i got were a bit on the fatty side, but no matter.  An excellent experience and and excellent food.

I ordered sweet and sour pork, pork fried rice, and egg rolls. My compatriot ordered Kung Pao chicken.  We just wanted some descent chinese food delivered to us.  We began with the egg rolls.  They were amazing. Not overly fried and soggy, where you can only taste the grease, like most places.  These were crisp and full of flavor.    My sweet and sour pork came delivered naked (sauce on the side).  Which was nice,  i hate it when the meat is soggy.  The rice was different than i expected.  It was light and a little less flavorful than I was hoping.  It was still good, but not compared to the amazing sweet and sour pork.  The sweet and sour sauce was thick and tangy.  Not just bland red syrup.  I put a little on the rice to liven in up a bit.  (Worked)  My compatriots only complaint with his Kung Pao Chicken was that is was not spicy enough.  I think that they could probably make it spicier next time if requested.  Amazing food, prompt delivery,  will be eating here again.
