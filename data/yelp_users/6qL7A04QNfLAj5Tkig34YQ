It is hard see how to improve Vincent Market Bistro.  Some have complained about table crowding in this relatively small restaurant, but there is ample room to maneuver and the noise level is not a problem.    The portions are not large, but they are not ridiculously small either.  You will probably want an appetiser and a main course, and possibly a dessert.  Get them all for $28 by using the prix frix offering.  This consists of a choice from 3 appetisers, a choice from 3 entrees, and a choice from 3 desserts.  The entries are top-end items too, such as steak, lobster, or rack of lamb.  HINT: I was told that reservations are not taken, and even on a weekday the venue gets crowded.  My suggestion is to go early, like 6 o'clock.

If you judge T. Cook's against restaurants in general, it probably deserves 5 stars, but if you judge it against what it purports to be, 4 is more accurate.  T. Cook's is a resort-style fine dining establishment.  The attentive valet parking, impressive entranceway, decor, and certainly the prices prove that.  It falls into the class of gourmet fine dining in most respects, but I have long had a problem with the food being unimaginative and the flavor profiles being too simple -- take the arugula salad, for example, which had a strong dried cranberry flavor but nothing else.  That said, T. Cooks has improved over the past few years and certainly has many good points.  The food is very well prepared (the John Dory was excellent), the wait staff is certainly knowledgeable, and the restaurant is attractive and not too noisy.  You won't have a bad experience here until the check arrives.  Of course, you expected the check because you saw their menu (maybe even online before you arrived).  But after finishing the meal, the net effect is "this could have been really great if only ..."  Tip:  before you go here, you might consider buying the Preferred Restaurants of Phoenix card.  Sunday through Thursday (or early on weekends), this gives you two entrees for the price of one, saving you $30-$40, and the card costs less than twice that.  Then you have a year to try about 30 other places.

This review is for Breadcrafters as a Cafe.  As a bakery, it had a very limited selection, at least by noon on a Saturday.  Breadcrafters is a "one-of" (not a chain) breakfast and lunch place just east of Paradise Valley mall, and it is a good one.  The real key to good sandwiches is good bread, so a place like this that bakes their own can have a big advantage -- if their bread is good.  In this case, it is.  Furthermore, the ingredients within the buns are fresh, tasty, and plentiful.  Special kudos to the tuna melt (not fried - just melted cheese), and a delight containing chicken and cheese.  An inventive mojito bar for dessert worked too.  Because it is fairly small, it can get crowded at peak times and I imagine that service could slow down a bit.  However, we waited only seven minutes when it was half full.  With its pleasant outdoor seating, as well as indoor, Breadcrafters is the best of class for sandwich places in Scottsdale-PV.

At one time, 5 & Diner was among the better old time diners available, but the competition has improved markedly over the years and they have gone backwards.  At least at this location.  First, the seating is not very comfortable.  The chairs are literally slippery and you have to position yourself carefully not to slide off.  The booths we were offered had one side too close to the table and the other too far.  Weird.  Breakfast should be a slam dunk for a diner, but not here.  The scrambled eggs were okay but not served hot.  The sausage was tasteless.  The home fries are just plain cubed potatoes dumped in a fryer with no accents (like onion, pepper).  The hash browns were buttery but without the usual crisp top layer.  The coffee was dishwater.  I gave an extra star for good service, but really, 5 & Diner, you don't deserve it.

This is the first review I have written that I truly hope the restaurant management reads.  Havana Cafe used to be one of the few restaurants I used to brag about to out-of-town friends.  They had a dozen dishes that I would classify as excellent and many others that were just "quite good".  But it has gone drastically downhill.  Here are a few examples:  1.  The appetizer portions are smaller than they used to be, sometimes ridiculously so.  For example, the chicken croquettes ($6) consisted of two pieces the size and shape of a thumb (a child's thumb), filled with pureed chicken and almost entirely tasteless.  2.  The entrees (we had ropa viejo and picadillo) were adequate in size but spiced very poorly.  The picadillo had no tropical spicing, and in fact tasted faintly bitter.  The ropa viejo was vinegary.  This points to incompetence in the cooking staff.  3.  The prices remain high.  But they are cutting corners -- no bread was served with the meal this time, for example.  4.  The menu was never really authentic Cuban, but it did have a number of popular Cuban dishes, with an interesting admixture of Central and South American favorites.  Some are still on the menu, but others have given way to meat loaf and fried chicken.  It looks to me like the management of Havana Cafe is flopping around, looking for a way to make money (or more money) and has made a series of poor decisions.  If you are listening:  it's time to hire a better chef, make the menu more authentic, get rid of those $5 plastic chairs, provide real value, and pay more attention to managing the wait staff.  I hope to see you back to your previous glory, but I'm not holding my breath.  And I am not spending $100 for two people for what you have to offer.

Olive Garden is undergoing changes and some of them are for the better, but on my last visit I was the victim of a minor fraud.  Tables now have tablets which are useful for calling your waiter.  They also have games on them.  One of the games, Trivia, started running without our ever touching the device, so we played it.  Later our bill came and we find we had been charged $1.99 for using the game.  Only then did we go back to the menu, bring up the list of games, and see that virtually all of the games are listed as "Premium Games" but no mention is made of a charge or what that charge would be.  Our waiter never mentioned this to us either.  I feel that this "sharp" practice and the introduction of higher-priced menu items is an attempt by the new management to make a profit no matter how.  What else are they doing that we don't see? Better idea -- cut down on the absurdly large portion sizes.

I am generally a fan of Fry's based upon comparison shopping for the things I buy.  This review is specific to those things that make this story different.  First, it's layout is more intuitive than most - things just seem to appear where you would expect them.  Shelves are almost always well-stocked, checkout is fast, and there are a lot of useful non-food items.  Negatives are a lack of a large ethnic and Kosher areas, and a disturbuing willingness of the produce department to leave substandard fruits and vegetables on the shelves -- I don't want to have to inspect every green bean.  When produce nears the end of its life, it should be discarded, not reduced in price, or worse yet packaged so that its less agreeable parts are hidden.

Sad to say, Ajo Al's continues to slide downhill.  At two recent trips we were served food that was obviously not freshly prepared - for example, eggs with chorizo which suspiciously had no trace of oil.  How is this possible since chorizo is so fatty?  Answer - the chorizo had been pre-cooked and then dumped into an egg mixture.  The result was burnt on the bottom but the cheese melted on top and the extremely hot plate told me it had been heated again, probably in an "alligator".  The result was dry, almost tasteless, and completely unsatisfying.    You want more - the chips were stale; the booth we were seated in had one normal side and one side where the seat was so low it would have been impossible to eat at it.  This could be fixed -- if anyone cared.  I've pretty much given up on you, Ajo.  Don't you know the mantra of today is fresh, fresh, fresh?

100+ reviews and this is my worst.  Dinner at Mimi's Cafe is an experience -- a very dull disappointing experience, at least at this branch.  I hope other locations are better, but I am beginning to think that the brain trust at Mimi's corporate central has a disdain for salt, pepper, or any other spice.  For example, my pot roast dinner, including a mixture of carrots and broccoli and a scoop of mashed potatoes, all heaped on one half of the plate, contained not a jot of taste.  The gelatenous brown "gravy" that was slobbered wholesale on the mashed potatoes and pot roast was a miracle -- how could they have managed to take the salt OUT of canned gravy?  Or did they actually make it themselves ... on purpose???  My wife's meal (chicken crepes) was just as bad.  The corn chowder did, I admit, have a little seasoning, but it was the thickness of school paste and tasted much the same.  The pork sliders had a sweet BBQ sauce, but the pork itself was mush.  The restaurant was clean and comfortable, and the service proper but distant and not very attentive.  But the food is the big problem here.  I hope the cook staff at this Mimis is just ignorant, uncaring, or hungover, because otherwise there is no hope whatsoever for this chain.  Note:  I have also eaten at Mimi's for breakfast several times.  Although better than dinner, Mimi's breakfasts are pretty ordinary.  The bakery items are, in general, better than the egg dishes, pancakes and waffles -- all of which are bland.  The muffins that accompany most meals are a cut above average.

I have been going here for 20 years, and have been treated like family since the beginning.  They are not cheap, but the quality is excellent, and they get the work done when they promise.  They have fixed innumerable tires for me, handled a problem that came up during an emissions inspection, and solved a dozen rattles, all gratis.  Perhaps best of all, if you don't need expensive repairs, they will tell you so -- many times they have suggested cheaper alternatives.  My son actually worked there one summer doing cleanup and driving people home, so I got all of the inside dirt.  Aside from what he swept up, there wasn't any.  Hard to believe, but for once, true.

I have never been to a restaurant as loud as Four Peaks, at least on a Wednesday evening before 6pm.  The room was about half full but the volume of noise was so great that I literally could not talk to my companion without leaning over.  So we left without ordering.  I think not being able to tolerate the environment is reasonable grounds for one star.  If you don't mind noise, the food might be good.  I'll never know.

This review is for the ten-year period I have been using Phoenix Pest Control.  They service my 4000 square foot, 1 acre home quarterly for $36.50 per visit.  The price has been virtually the same for the entire ten years.  In addition, they have taken care of bee infestations three times (extra fee for this).  Bottom line is that I have not had any significant pest problem during that entire period, although I routinely had unwanted visitors before starting to use them.  They are punctual and courteous, and very accomodating to my varying times of availability.  NOTE: I have no affiliation of any kind with this company, and they did not suggest that I write a review.

Want citrus trees?  Or maybe you want more, or maybe you have some and they are not doing everything you would like them to do.  This is your place.  Rarely do I find a commercial establishment where the staff are truly experts in what they sell - usually questions get quizzical looks and meaningless answers.  But talk to John, look over the grounds (yes the trees are actually growing here), and be amazed.  Just seeing Greenfield Nursery is an experience.    Wander around with or without a salesperson, sample fruit from the trees (watch out for the peacocks), and select the varieties that work best for you.  They will tell you about frost sensitivity, fruit retention (do they drop to the ground before ripening), taste, pollination issues, planting in proximity to other trees, and just about anything else you need to know.  Then they will plant your trees properly and guarantee them (in my area, this meant jack hammering the slate out of the way and adding good soil to the hole).  And all this costs about the same as any other nursery charges.  HINT:  Take pictures of your trees and the general area where you want to plant.  They can look at a picture of a tree and tell you what it had for breakfast.  Amazing!

Roaring Fork is not perfect but it is pretty close.  I could find no fault with most of the dishes we were served, from the bread to the fig and goat cheese complimentary pre-appetizer to the main courses (trout and blackened redfish).  The sides with the redfish were not only tasty but perfectly complimented the fish.  Only the delicious creme brulee had a tiny problem - it was still too warm and had not completely set -- but we devoured it eagerly anyway.  Add to this that the prices are quite reasonable for what is truly a fine dining (modern style) experience, and Roaring Fork takes a place on my "return to" list.  A few very small issues - our table for two was a bit too small, I didn't care for the music (some sort of raucous jazz I think), and the separation of the happy hour and dining areas was confusing - I should be able to get the happy hour discounts in the dining area.  Thanks for a fine meal, Roaring Fork.

I can see why some people give Grimaldi's five stars -- their execution is consistently perfect.  If you like the modern style of New York pizza, made with fresh mozzarella, you will enjoy your pie.  Period.  End of story.  Well, not quite.  Here are some issues:  1.  The salads are large but uninspired.  Fresh, but just the usual ingredients. 2.  The crust is thin and crispy -- if you like bready crusts, go somewhere else. 3.  Here, the pizza is about the cheese, but the red sauce could be a bit better and more abundant. 4.  It gets crowded easily -- you may have to wait.  This are really just minor things, but they add up.  Grimaldi's is a good pizzeria, but it is just a pizzeria after all.  By the way, they have another place in northern Scottsdale.  In my opinion, this location is better.  The pizzas up north have been soggy the two times I ate there.  Hint:  I think the milder toppings are better here because the crust and cheese are the stars.  Spicy pepperoni only detracts.  You might like tomato and basil.-

Fine dining in Scottsdale gets no better than Rancho Pinot, located in a small mall, decorated in what can only be called a quirky manner, and serving food that is often astonishingly good.  Do not be fooled by the faux Western wall hangings - Rancho Pinot is using them to tell you that they are striving for a comfortable feel and unstuffy service.  Take them for what they are.  After you taste the food you won't care and when you finish the meal you will probably ... well you will probably think the decor is still quirky.  As to the food, Rancho is serious about creativity.  They do standard dishes with flavors, ingredients, and twists that make almost everything into an "oh, wow!".  Once in a while they miss, as they did with the grilled striped bass, which they dried out a little going for crispy.  But not often, and even then the sides were superb.  One example: their strawberry shortcake is pretty standard except the shortcake is basically a scone, and it works beautifully.  Expensive indeed, but not too much so for what you get.

Caffe Boa is an upscale Italian restaurant located in the midst of College Town Tempe, and has been praised for being better than the greasy spoons that students often patronize.  It is indeed that, and the ambiance (especially on the patio in good weather) is of that same class.  But the food, for the most part, is not.  Appetisers were particularly disappointing, both small, unimaginative, and lacking flavor.  The shrimp was really terrible, having that soapy taste you can get with poorly prepared shellfish.  The bread lacked taste and crispness.  Not good.  The entries were spotty but a bit better.  The pasta with rabbit was both creative and tasty, but the chicken with rosemary was overcooked (as was the halibut).    Worse yet, service was pleasant but very very slow.  It took an hour and a half from the time we ordered our entrees to when we got them.    And the third strike is the price -- too high for what you get, although I do not agree with some of the complaints about small portion size for the entrees.

Ladybug is a small office building lunch room with the usual lack of ambiance, frayed menus, and informal service (order at the counter).  However, it has three things going for it that place it near the top of its genre:  a good variety of food, lower than average prices, and most importantly tasty well-prepared fare.  HINT: There aren't too many tables and no good alternate place to sit, so if you want to eat in, try to get there at 12:00 or a little before.

Fast-service BBQ places abound in just about every town and city, and they all deliver pretty much the same menu: BBQ brisket, pulled pork, chicken, sometimes ribs and burgers.  Tom's is the same.  Usually the ambiance is booths and plain tables-and-chairs.  Often you order at a counter and they bring you the food.  Tom's is the same.  Prices are usually a bit more than fast food but not as much as regular sit-down restaurants.  You guessed it - Tom's is the same.  But this Tom's has a problem.  Consider the brisket platter for about $10, which consists of brisket, a biscut, and a side.  What could be so bad?  Well, it was the brisket.  The portion consisted of about 3 ounces (maybe 4) of meat utterly covered in a sweet BBQ sauce -- not cooked with the sauce, just inundated with it.  Ok - scrape it off, you will suggest.  So I did.  What was underneath was small slices entirely from the fatty part of the brisket.  Half of my small portion of meat was fat, and not crispy tasty fat but soggy discouraging muck.  The pictures on the wall showed lots of lean slices from the first cut of the brisket -- misleading? or downright fraudulent?  Now I see why they put 6 ounces of BBQ sauce on 3 ounces of meat.  I notice that the rest of our group of six was eating their food, mostly, but without any outward signs of real pleasure.  That at least was comforting - misery loves company.

We go here from time to time when in Las Vegas, but not regularly.  Like many places in Las Vegas, the food is decent but the price is high.  What you will get here is slightly imaginative food -- they serve olive oil and a selection of salts with the bread, for example.  But in the end, a pizza is a pizza, and these are good but not great.  The ambiance, however, is way above average, and thus the fourth star.  See my picture for the view you get when dining on their patio.  Hint:  There are two restaurants here.  The fancy one to the right as you come in and the more casual one to the left.  The fancy one is not better and is more expensive, and there is no patio dining.  The confusion is because there is only one check in stand.  Be sure to get a table in the casual area, to the left, and definitely on the patio.

Probably the least expensive of the upscale Bellagio restaurants, Jasmine is standard Chinese, although they try to prepare dishes with a bit of flair.  The whole crispy fish was competently prepared, moderately large, and tasty, especially with the spicy tomato sauce that comes on the side.  Unfortunately, nothing else was very good, and one chicken dish was absolutely bad -- undercooked chicken, yech!  Because its a relative bargain, and because of the spectacular view of the fountain show, I would go three stars on Jasmine, but there is nothing else to recommend it.  Update as of April, 2012:  At a second visit, we tried the Peking Duck.  At $78, it is a bit pricey, but you get a HUGE duck, carved tableside, and made into 8 overstuffed rolls.  Plenty for a main course for two, and delicious.  It earns Jasmine a fourth star.

AZ 88 (so named since it was opened in 1988) is definitely the kind of place that you can really enjoy one time and not so much the next.  Even though my visit was great, I can see the shortcomings.  That said, this review was for a Sunday lunch when the weather was great and the outdoor patio seating was a treat.  The patio overlooks Civic Center Plaza, trees, flowers, interesting people, and no cars.  It is kept clean and the seats are comfortable!  The food was just right for the time.  My grilled cheese sandwich came with a thick slice of perfect tomato and several slices of very tasty bacon grilled inside the sandwich and a hardboiled egg - neatly sliced -- on the side.  Add waffle fries and it made a really pleasurable meal.  My wife had the picnic chicken sandwich with real slices of cold grilled chicken and lots of it, set amidst a beautiful fruit plate.  Service was perfect as well and the price is moderate, about $10 a sandwich.  So why wouldn't you enjoy AZ 88?  Our experience was based on: 1.  Sitting on the patio 2.  Beautiful weather 3.  Wanting only a simple lunch 4.  Getting there before the rush so we could get a good table -- if was full by 12:30  If you want a more substantial meal, or something fancier, AZ 88 might not live up to your expectations.  And if you eat inside, the restaurant loses most of its charm and becomes just another comfort food place.  But I can only review what I experienced, and that was five star.

The Bellagio is five stars all the way IF you intend to spend a substantial portion of your time in the resort and casino, AND IF you don't mind spending money or you are a moderately large gambler (you will get comps).  But only IF.  For a place to sleep, you have better or less expensive choices.  See what kind of deal you can get at Aria.  The rooms are only four star by any standard.  Recent upgrades have addressed the TV and bathroom issues, but the building still is 15 years old.  You can get more opulent and modern rooms at Aria, for example.  The common areas are five stars, led by the incomparable fountain display and the conservatory.  These are among top five attractions in Las Vegas.  Also note the Chihuly glass flower canopy in the lobby.    The buffet is the #1 buffet in Las Vegas, and the holiday dinner buffets are particularly fine.  Breakfast is a great value too (but not weekend brunch).  The rest of the dining establishments are good but not good enough for their cost.  A possible exception is Picasso, which, at $150-$200 a person, might still be considered worthwhile.  Service is generally very good to excellent, although at busy times there is sometimes a wait to check in.  This seems to be true everywhere in Las Vegas.  When well trained employees are hassled, they tend to act hassled, although at least at Bellagio the smiles usually remain, if somewhat frozen.  Here are a few tips: 1.  Make sure you get a room in the main tower.  A good fountain view (from at least the 20th floor) may be your preference the first time you stay here, but it will be noisy.  You will hear the fountain shows every 15-30 minutes until midnight.  A pool view is quieter. 2.  If you gamble, be sure to get a Player's Card and use it.  After a relatively modest amount of gambling in any year, you will get upgraded from the lowest (Sapphire) status and important percs become available -- such as line passes to the buffet and coffee shop. 3.  Jean Phillipe's is a good place for breakfast and lunch, and the bakery desserts are worth the price.  Make sure you ask them to grill the Paninis.  Some of the packaged products are expensive even for the Bellagio. 4.  Eat at the buffet or coffee shop (Picasso for a real splurge). 5.  See "O".  Make you reservations way ahead of time.  It is that good.  I have seen virtually every show in Las Vegas, and "O" is #1.  [Here's an odd note -- of the many Cirque de Soleil shows in Las Vegas, the shorter the name, the better the show.  "O" is the best, followed closely by "Ka", etc.  Forget about "Zumanity".]

Five star food, but slight problems with the service and a greater problem with the ambiance.  The most important point here is where you sit.  They have outside seating right on the Strip - great for people watching and a view of the Bellagio fountains show.  HOWEVER: 1.  You can't reserve a table outside - you can get put on a list and it may be a long one. 2.  Despite heaters and misters, it gets hot or cold and you may want to reconsider if the outside air temperature is under 60 or over 100 (during the day, over 90). If you sit insider, where most of the tables are located, it is crowded and fairly noisy.  Some of the cushion style seats are uncomfortable, particularly if you have to sit on a seam between cushions.  The service is friendly and knowledgeable, but they are always in a rushs.  This is not the place for a leisurely dinner.  One word about the food, which is uniformly good:  the steaks frites are superior.

Top notch buffet.  Fairly expensive but not much more so that other less deserving offerings.  The breakfast buffet could hardly be improved upon, but go only weekdays.  On weekends and holidays, it is a brunch and considerably more expensive.  The dinner buffet is good anytime, but is very very good on weekends and holidays, when it is $37 ($30 weekdays), but has a dozen additional premium offerings, such as grilled quail, beef wellington, Chinese style ribs, lobster ravioli, etc.  On special holidays, it even gets better (Christmas goose, for example).  Lines are very long on holidays and sometimes on weekends -- I've seen 3+ hour waits.  If you are a casino guest, you get a line pass, but otherwise try off hours (early for breakfast or dinner is best).

Holiday buffets are now nearly $50, and the value proposition is starting to lose its glitter.  I also detect a slight cheapening, and a willingness to substitute for even the premium items listed on the promotion-board outside the restaurant (for example, the promised Peking Duck was changed to a forgetable grilled duck breast).

I am not given to superlatives, but "O" is easily the best show in Las Vegas, and possibly the best in the world.  But if you take my word for it and go with expectations of the unbelievable, you may be disappointed.  And you may resent the substantial amount of dough you plunked down for tickets.  On the other hand, if you go without SPECIFIC expectations and just let the experience wash over you, not trying to follow the story line -- which doesn't exist in any case -- you most likely will leave with a grin on your face, a smile in your heart, and a five star review forming in your head.  It's happened to me four times over the years.  Here are a few hints --  THE DOS: 1.  The best seats are around the tenth to fifteen rows (row one is indeed "A" here), and not towards the sides.  The main theater consists of sections 101 - 105, with 103 being the center.  102 and 104 are also fine.  Order way ahead - O often sells out. 2.  I like the 10:00 time better because this is a stream-of-conciousness type of show and a couple of drinks (just a couple) frees the mind.  You can buy them just outside the theater and carry them in if you want. 3.  Experience the theater itself - it is a wonder.  "O" could not be performed effectively without this super-venue.  THE DON'TS: 1.  Don't worry about the two clown routines, which are somewhat sophomoric.  They are needed to provide rest for the cast and a chance to change scenes.  You'll see why the rest is needed. 2.  Don't focus entirely on the main performers.  Each scene has a focal point, but there will also be other things happening all over the stage.  These are an important part of the whole, so let your eyes take in the entire flow of the action. 3.  Don't try to understand the lyrics -- consider it an sort of extra-galactic opera.  By the way, "O" is a Cirque de Soliel show, of which there are five or six running in Las Vegas.  There is a simple way of determining which are the best: the shorter the name, the better the show.  "O" is #1, followed by "Ka", "Love", etc.  Forget about Zumanity.  And guys, if you are taking a date, "O" in Las Vegas is as near a sure thing as there is.

It's hard to dis a restaurant in the Bellagio just because it's expensive, so leaving that aside, there is very little wrong with Fix.  The decor is modern, lively but not noisy, and moderately comfortable (the booths can be a bit tight).  The food is up-styled American and tasty.  I particularly recommend the tomato soup starter -- the soup tastes like a good cheese pizza without the crust, and it comes with an impeccable grilled cheese sandwichlet.  The crispy chicken is also surprisingly good; no breading, just a crispy skin.  But then I've eaten here twice and neither my wife nor I ever had anything you could call a dud.  However, nothing is over-the-top great, and with a prominent bar, TV screens, no tableclothes, etc., it doesn't feel like a fancy restaurant, and you just don't feel your $60-$80 per person was well spent, even at the Bellagio.

You have to judge a restaurant against what it tries to be, and what Il Mulino tries to be is an "experience".  A very expensive experience.  A very expensive experience with food that is only good, not great (with exceptions).    But Il Mulino does succeed is being an experience.  The decor is elegant and "rich".  The staff, for the most part, polished and proficient, but not fawning.  You start off with complimentary breads including garlic bread, bruschetta, grilled zucchini, fabulous aged parmesan cheese.  All this before you order.  And you end the meal with complementary grappa.  The meal is well paced, the clientele interesting, and the food "good enough".  Since the main course portions are more than adequate, and you are already half full from the freebies, you can probably skip the appetisers.  Listen carefully to the long list of specials, recited at breakneak speed (interrupt if you need to), because a lot of the good stuff is here.  The bronzini baked in salt is much like signature dishes in fine restarants in Spain and Italy -- spectacularly good.  All of the pastas are good; don't order half portions as they are almost the same price as full portions.  Some of the meat dishes are only ok.  The bill will be high -- about $100 a person with a glass of wine, tax, tip, and maybe a dessert and side dish.  But if this is what you expected from Il Mulino, you will go away happy.

I won't be back, sorry, but although I like middle eastern cooking, I don't like kebobs much.  Eden's Grill is essentially a kebob house - virtually all of the entries are combinations of four types: chicken, beef, lamb, ground beef.  And they are pretty good kebabs too, but I just don't like kebobs much.  I could quibble about the vegetables being underdone, nearly raw actually.  Or I could say the sauce container was so small that it was hard to dip pieces of meat in it.  The dinnerware was kind of flimsy.  It's a small place and you may have trouble walking in and getting a table sometimes.    The point is that Eden's does what it does competently and with no serious faults.  I just don't like kebabs enough to return.  But for anyone who does like them, four stars is fair.

Baiz Market surprised me in two ways.  First, it was larger than I expected, with a sizable produce area, meat market, and even a small restaurant.  Second, it was pretty much true to its mission, providing a wide variety of ethnic foods from the Middle East.  Although it bills itself as having a wider representation, such as Europe, don't expect Danish cookies or Italian pasta.  European apparently means Turkey and Greek in this context.  But because Baiz Market does not fall into the trap of also carrying a host of "American" goods, it is able to provide many choices in its ethnic aisles, often including several brands or varieties of an item.  If you like to try different foods, stop by and give it a look.

First of all, it's just a coffee shop.  Never mind that bacon and eggs is $14 -- that's just the Bellagio where all food is expensive (see if you can find where they hide the $9 hot dogs).  Cafe Bellagio is a standard Las Vegas resort coffee shop.  They do the same kind of food as everywhere else, they are open 24/7, the atmosphere is casual, etc. etc.  So what do you expect?  Actually, you can expect quite a great deal here.  First, the approach is through the Bellagio conservatory and that's worth a visit in itself.  Second, its attractive, clean, and inviting, and the service is better than average (for a coffee shop).  But, even though the menu is just what you would expect, the execution in the kitchen is thoroughly competent -- they make the stuff right.  So it comes out hot, tastes good, and leaves you satisfied.  This is the only coffee shop I have ever rated 4 stars.  But those of you who give it 5 stars -- come on, get a life.  It's only a coffee shop.

This is a modern interpretation of a Brazilian steak house, and it succeeds in most respects, especially the competent food.  However, there are rough edges.  The drinks are expensive and hardly generous.  The service, even when the restaurant was less than half full, was a little too slow.  And one of our party had the bad luck to order a steak medium rare and get it very well done indeed.  When he sent it back, it took them over 20 minutes to bring him another -- entirely too long for such a dish.  The waiter's response was "it's not my fault."  However, it was comped and we all got free dessert, which is at least part of a proper response.  Probably worth going to, if you have a 2 for 1 coupon.

The most notable thing about Sassi is the ambience.  The restaurant is located within an Italian villa, with eating rooms scattered here and there.  The building is impressive but the star is the outdoor patio which features mountain and desert views, spectacular especially at sunset.    The food might not quite make five stars but the view -- ah, the view.  BIG HINT:  Get a patio table.  Request it on your reservation and go early particularly on busy days.  As to the food, Sassi clearly uses very high quality ingredients, and the kitchen staff prepares everything well.  I can site the very fresh greens and goat cheese in our salad, and an exceptional branzino.  However, in all cases, the flavor profiles are nothing special - salt and pepper and lemon they know about, but there are few other spices, and the sides to the entrees were uninspired, and in one case, inedible (stringy broccolini).  For two people, with a carafe of sangria, olives, two appetizers, two entrees, one dessert and coffee, the tab came to $160 including tax and tip.  Not cheap but just about right for what Sassi delivers.  SMALL HINT:  Since you want to see sunset from your patio table, April and May are the best months to go.  The temperature outside will probably be great, and sunset occurs late enough so that you can watch it during your dinner.

I am not as enthusiastic about the Cornish Pasty Company as some, but if you are looking for this type of place to eat, you will probably enjoy the experience.  A Pasty is basically a turnover; at Cornish Pasty Company, it is a very big turnover.  One is a meal.  Here they precook them until they are almost done, then finish them when you order.  This process introduces a drying effect that detracts from the product.  They do serve a sauce with each pasty, and as the sauces we tried were quite good, you can use the sauce to counteract the dryness. When all is said and done, the pastys are tasty.  But not knock-your-socks-off great.  The atmosphere at Cornish Pasty Company is cramped and noisy.  It seems more like a college hangout than a restaurant, and this is not surprising because it is a college hangout, but one where the quality of the food has attracted a wider clientele.  If you like this kind of atmosphere, you will be right at home at one of the few small tables or at the bar.  I prefer the bar.  Prices are low (typically about $9 for a pasty), considering the size of the meal.  Hints: 1.  It is always crowded.  Try to come at an off hour, like 4:30 on a weekday. 2.  Skip the very average salads and the oven chips (dry, tasteless), and probably the other appetisers.  Just get a pasty.  If you are an abnormally big eater, follow it up with a dessert pasty. 3.  It is a bit hard to find.  Turn North on Hardy from University to find the Cornish Pasty Company in a small shopping center hidden by a large gas station.

Food is the same but this location has greatly expanded.  Although it still gets crowded sometimes, you can now come at 6:00 on weekdays and probably get a seat.  I was a bit concerned however about the outside area which is poorly maintained and dirty.   I know it's outside, but you can still clean tables get the splinters out of the wooden seating.  Are the portions a bit smaller?  If so, all to the good.  This still has a college handout ambiance but most of the patrons are not college students, so perhaps Cornish Pasty could encourage their servers to dress just a bit nicer and act a bit nicer.

Although Cantina Laredo books itself as "gourmet Mexican", it really serves mainly the usual staples - enchiladas or tacos with rice and beans, etc.  So why the "gourmet"?  Maybe it's because the portions are a little smaller or the prices a little higher than your neighborhood favorites.  So how come the four stars?  It's mainly because the food is a cut above the ordinary.  The tacos had so much meat that they were really a handful; even the salsa with the perfect thin crispy chips was different -- a tasty tomatillo salsa if I'm not mistaken.  The chicken enchilada was full of flavor but the beef enchilada was just overly hot (almost inedible).  Cantina Laredo likes to serve its entrees on plates that are just barely big enough to hold the food.  This makes it feel like you are getting small plates although actually the portions are quite filling.  Maybe that's why I probably won't go back - it's just a feeling I get when eating here.  The ambiance, service and the cuisine don't quite match up and it makes me uneasy.  In the final analysis, we often return to restaurants just because they feel right, and for me Cantina Laredo doesn't make the grade.  But you might react differently -- worth a try.

This review is for the kosher market, not for the adjacent restaurant, which I have never tried.    I drive 20 miles to get here a couple of times a month.  Why?  Not for the prices, which are in line with other kosher stores in this area, but definitely not cheap.  Not for the ambiance, which is clean but crowded and a little disorderly.  Here's why --  Imperial Kosher tries to serve the needs of the kosher community in a very small store, and it succeeds.  Selection is surprisingly large for such a small space.  They seem to have most of the essentials, including meats, cheeses, and a full service deli.  Most importantly, somebody has spent time trying to get good quality products on the shelves; not everything marked kosher is something you would enjoy eating, but Imperial has found a lot of worthy items.  Don't be afraid to try a brand you don't know well.  This is a true family place, so don't expect supermarket-like efficiency.  But do expect friendly service and people who care about their customers.    IMPERIAL: Suggestion for your restaurant.  At off hours, anyway, consider making it into a self-service coffee/tea bar.  Make some reading materials available, sell a few pastries.  Maybe your customers will hang around for a while.  You could be a cool meeting place.

Why isn't this place bigger???  During the tourist season, it is hard to get a reservation for this tiny neighborhood Italian restaurant.  Why?  Because the food is really good.    Although Tesoro is in a minor mall, you should not think that this is your typical local Italian joint -- pizza, spaghetti, watery sangria, etc.  On the contrary, Tesoro is Italian fine dining, but with a slighty lower price.    Of course, we only tried a sampling of their dishes, but I'll bet that everything is delicious.  The portions are not overly large, so you will have room for an appetiser, but by the time we finished, no one had enough appetite to order a dessert.    NOTE:  I did overhear them saying they were closing for parts of July and August, so call ahead.  You will want a reservation anyway.

Of course, Fort McDowell casino does not compare to any of the better casinos in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately, it does not compare well with other Indian casinos anywhere either.  The biggest problems are: slots set to pay around 70% (exception: poker and keno slots pay much better, as they do everywhere); smoke problem has improved but is still very bad; food choices mediocre at best; not always clean.  Live blackjack is acceptable.  Bingo is crowded but typical.  Some people like the poker room.

I was inclined to offer Wally's three stars based on its being clean and comfortable and based on fast and courteous service, despite the disappointing food, but I can't do it -- I just feel so "fooled".  A restaurant that looks like this should have a real cook.  Now if your thing is frozen or pre-prepared ingredients dropped into a deep fryer or popped into a heating device, Wally's is for you.  Perhaps they actually cook something from scratch, but, if so, I don't know what it is.  Now I could be mistaken but I don't think so -- my fish and chips was not hand-dipped fresh cod; I am almost certain is was prebattered frozen product taken from a bag or box and dropped into a deep frier - mushy and lacking crunch.  Ditto for my wife's panini - the chicken pieces in which tasted like boiled and bagged stuff (I don't like to use the "g" word).    As I say, I could be wrong, but if so, then Wally's has bigger problems.  If they are using fresh ingredients, cooked and prepared to order, then they really need new cooks.  On the plus side, the french fries were decent and the beer was cold and not overpriced.  Inside seating is limited, so if it is too hot for the patio, you may have trouble getting a table.  No big loss.

I am going to have to go back to Andreoli because the one problem that kept it from being five stars may have been a fluke, and because there are other menu items I really want to try.  Andreoli is mainly a restaurant with an Italian deli and a few dry goods.  It is small and informal but comfortable and clean.  You order at the counter, but the food is brought to your table.  We had two of the sandwiches -- Italian sausage and an eggplant-based vegetarian option.  The homemade bread was top-notch, crispy and tasty, and for me bread makes the sandwich.  The vegetarian sandwich was delicious in all respects, a kind of eggplant parmesan on a roll.  The onions and peppers on the sausage sandwich almost but not quite saved the day, because the sausage (in the form of a patty the size of a large thin hamburger) was over-charred and bitter.    There was one more flaw -- the salad served with the sandwiches had been doused in Italian dressing so heavily that it was nearly inediable.  Perhaps you can get the dressing on the side.  They also have pasta and other entrees and a case full of homemade Italian desserts, at least three of which have my name on them.  Almost every other diner was ordering desserts, which you rarely see in a restaurant, but we were so full from our sandwiches that we didn't try them -- until next time.

I have now eaten here several times and my original review pretty much stands.  The food is usually better than good but there are occasional misses.  And I can't get away from thinking that Andreoli is a bit too expensive for a neighborhood eatery.

Before you decide to go to Desert Botanical Garden's annual Luminarias nights, there are a few things you need to know.  First and foremost, this is a unique and spectacular venue when lit at night by luminarias (candles in bags), discreet but well-placed floodlights, and, this year, special glass and fiber optics displays.  If you go to immerse yourself in the experience, you will not be disappointed.  The view of dozens of miles of fiber optics radiating from two nearby mountains and running down all the way to the upper slopes of the Gardens is unreal.  I have never seen anything like it.  But ... But you should be prepared for: 1.  Even on a warm day, it will be cold after sitting and walking for an hour or two (or four), so dress much more warmly than you think will be necessary. 2.  It ain't cheap, but it sells out many nights, so don't expect a bargain. 3.  It will get crowded, but you can take this as a social experience -- it works on that level. 4.  The food is expensive and not really very good, except perhaps the hot chocolate for $3.  Eat first.  HINTS: 1.  This is not a good choice for children under about ten years old. 2.  Don't even think about coming without having bought tickets first (online works well). 3.  Select the 5:30 admission -- you can still stay the whole night. 4.  At the music venues, plan to spend time. Many of the performers are much better than you might expect. Seats are very limited, but some open up after each musical number as people leave, so stay alert and you will be able to snag some.

This review is specifically for the Sunday brunch.  It is tempting to compare every brunch to the major Las Vegas brunches, which may be unfair since the clientele is so different, but this is the first one that I think compares favorably, even with the #1 Vegas brunch (the Bellagio).  It is also a bit more expensive at over $40 per person.  There is a reasonably wide variety of food, including the obligatory omelet station, which can be mobbed unfortunately.  In addition, there is a crepe station with four varieties including a dessert offering, a cold foods table with about 20 items, a few hot dishes of which the potatoes and shrimp/salmon were the best, hand-sliced ham and prime rib, and the usual breads, bacon, sausage, etc.  Just about everything is competently prepared from quality ingredients, except the prime rib (about as bad as it gets - tough and flavorless) and the desserts (uninspired).  Still, for a buffet, the number of hits vs. misses was high, the service was as good as it gets, and the physical setting is beautiful.  This brunch is definitely for special occasions but I would return, forget about the price, and enjoy being.

Don't believe a word I write about Indian Paradise because, after all, I am a devotee of Indian food.  Don't believe me when I tell you that the lunch buffet here consists of about a dozen main dishes and at least ten of them are superb.  Please don't believe me about just how delicious the tikka masalas are, or the saag paneer (creamy Indian cheese and spinach).  Please, please, don't believe any of it, because if you do, then you will start coming here and your friends will follow and soon I won't be able to get a table.  Seriously, the secret of Indian Paradise is that they cook everything very expertly.  The only downside -- it is a relatively small buffet -- is really a blessing in disguise, because if they had even one more option, I would have to try it and would then be unable to rise from my chair at the end of the meal.  Here is what you will get (in general, as the menu varies somewhat from day to day): chicken tandoori, chicken and/or goat curry (their goat is a rare misfire, often too bony), chicken or cheese tikki masala, at least one creamy spinach dish, a couple of other meat entrees, lentils, several vegetarian options, at least one of which will be pretty spicy, rice, naan and one other bread, a couple of appetisers (like samosas, for example), a half dozen sauces, and rice pudding and honeyed cheese balls for dessert.  To drink, included in the price, try the mango lassi.  Hints:  Don't eat breakfast.  Don't worry about cooking dinner.

For a beverage superstore, this BevMo has an appallingly poor selection of wines.  I was shopping for kosher wines, in particularly, and found only two selections (not counting kiddush wines).  Total Wines has more than a dozen, by comparison.  A quick perusal of some of my other favorite categories showed a weird mixture of cheap off or unknown brands and a smattering of standards, but no imagination, no creativity, and no fun.

Gosh, I would love to give Pars Persian five stars, but it just doesn't quite make it.  Maybe 4.4 stars.   There were a few rough edges.  For example, the night we went the one mainstream fish item was not available.  The servers are friendly but pretty much what you would expect in a strip-mall restaurant, but the interior is 3/4 of the way to posh.  You can't worry about things like that when you come here.  As to the food -- I thought everything was very good to exceptional, but my wife found some of the stews only adequate.  This is more Persian than most Americans are used to in a Persian restaurant, and that is both its strength and its weakness.  My advice -- be adventurous, and if you don't really care for something, try something else next time.  And I think there will be a next time; in fact, for me, if the prices were just a few dollars cheaper (and they are not unreasonable at all), there would be many next times.  I could eat at Pars Persian every week and not tire of the food.

This review is now based upon two experiences.  The first time here I gave Herb Box five stars despite a service issue thanks to very good food.  After my second experience, it loses a star.  In fact, if yesterday's dinner had been my first here, the Herb Box would have struggled to get even three.  The big problem here, I think, is that management (especially front of the house) is very poor, if it exists at all.  I'll start with what went wrong this time.  Although we had a nice table, and our server was very pleasant, she was not very effective.  It took over an hour to get our main courses, a glass had green matter stuck on it, a knife had a broken tip, and the server disappeared for 10 or 15 minutes at a time.  The food also was not as good - maybe I was lucky the first time, but today the pakora was served cold (I think a cold dressing was poured over luke warm food).  Other dishes we tried were unimaginative or outright misses.  Now on to the first review which originally earned The Herb Box five stars.  First, the issue.  This location of the Herb Box is in a space that is not ideal for a restaurant, or else it was poorly designed.  Some of the tables are fine, but there are so many angles and nooks that a fair number of them are very inconvenient.  This is especially true of their tables for two -- in fact, I would recommend not coming here unless you have a party of three or more because you will be seated at one of these problems.  Our table was stuck in a corner so tight that we had trouble getting to it.  The table top was marred by digs and scratches (as was the one next to us), and both the table and chair wobbled due to an uneven floor.  When we asked for something else, we were shown even worse options.  For the food to make me forget this inconvenience would be a near impossibility - but it did.  I would particularly like to mention the pakora appetiser, which epitomizes the Herb Box's ability to marry flavors and textures into a creative and thoroughly enjoyable taste treat.  The Thai ribs, mac and cheese side dish, and even the trout continue this theme.  How can grilled trout be tasty?  Try adding pickled condiments and a scallion-based creamy side.  It really worked.  Will the real Herb Box please stand up?

I almost desperately want to give NoRTH five stars, because the food is really something special, but it has one huge problem -- its very, very noisy (outside may be better if it is cool enough).    About the food - traditional Italian fare is freshly and expertly prepared before your eyes (well you can see the cooks but not the cooking).  The short ribs are particularly well done, and I recommend the platter version because the onions, greens, and other fixings are perfect for the dish.  The pasta is freshly made and tastes like it.  Another recommendation: the arancini (fried rice balls in a red sauce).  Hint: don't order the pizza; it might be really good but you don't want to miss the other menu items.  There is a decent wine list and a number of beers, including Italian offerings.  The prices seem high for beer but low for wine, which is a bit odd.  Service is pleasant, although on crowded nights it can be a bit of a wait for your food.  But don't worry -- you will be entertained by the other patrons: NoRTH is kind of a meat market, both at the bar and at the tables, so people watching can be, shall we say, diverting.

It's all true - they are that good.  In what ways? 1.  The technician was courteous and helpful, moving furniture we said he didn't have to move. 2.  The work was careful and thorough. 3.  He said the carpet would be ready to walk on in 6 to 8 hours, and it actually was. 4.  The results were perfect, even on a couple of areas we had given up on. 5.  The price was only about 10% more expensive than the cheapie ("three rooms and a dog loft for $99") quotes.  Nope - I am not a friend or relative and they didn't ask me to leave a review.

I have used him for irrigation system repairs for years now and can recommend him based upon the big three factors:  1.  He shows up when he says he will. 2.  He does work correctly and fully.  His thoroughness is important because more than once he caught something that I had not specifically reported and fixed it without asking (when there was no additional charge). 3.  He doesn't invent things that need to be fixed.  One issue: he may not return your call right away.  Remember this is a very small business and he is probably out working when you call.  Note:  He is not a friend or relative and did not ask for this review.  Reliable service people are hard to find so I just thought I would spread the word.

An interesting, almost unique experience, dinner at Cafe Monarch is much like that in a small Spanish or Mediterranean cafe.  There are 17 seats, one chef, one waiter, and a fixed menu (you get your choice of three entrees however).  If you have special dietary requirements, tell the chef when you make your absolutely necessary reservations a month in advance.  The experience earns the four stars, but the food is not good enough to propel Cafe Monarch beyond that.  Not that it's bad -- but there are too many rough edges and not quites, such as the superfluous undercooked potatoes in the London Broil salad.  Service is slow -- three courses in two hours -- but you won't mind since you can watch the chef cooking from most tables and it is an exceptionally comfortable place to eat.  Definitely bring your own wine, expect to experience new tastes, ignore the minor eccentricities, and you will be glad you came.

Indulge Burgers is a fairly successful implementation of the "design your own burger" genre, of which Slater's 50/50 in the Los Angeles area is the prototype.  At Indulge Burgers, you fill in a form indicating what type of meat you want on your burger, what type of bread, cheeses, condiments, etc.  The smallest burger is 1/2 pound and costs $9.99, unless you choose to up the price by adding bacon or one of the other "premium" toppings.  There are the usual sides -- the onion strings are the best -- and a few specials such as a patty melt, briscut sliders, and pulled pork.  On the plus side, service is good, the food is well prepared, and the ingredients are of good quality.  On the negative side, the bread choices are all mediocre and get soggy (whatever happened to a grilled or toasted bun, for example?), the fries and sweet potato fries were none too fresh, and the atmosphere is non-existent.  Still, in the end, the food is good enough so that if you crave a burger better than what you can get at a fast food place, this is probably your best choice in Scottsdale.

The food is actually three star or maybe a bit better, and the ambience is okay.  The problems: 1.  Very expensive for what you get. 2.  A wait staff that hounds you to death.  I've been to a number of Brazilian steak houses, where they bring skewers of meats to your table and you ask for pieces of the ones you want.  You can eat until you are stuffed.  There is also a salad bar which has about 30 items, most of them high end and of good quality (such as fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, heart of palm, etc.).  They bring bread, fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and fried polenta to your table.  But mostly its about the meat.  Fogo de Chao has about ten varieties, including filet mignon, top and bottom sirloin, a couple of lamb cuts, bacon wrapped chicken, etc.  If you don't like your meat medium rare, you will have to ask them to cook you something (which they will do).  In general, the meats are ok, but pretty much without sauce and seasoned with salt and pepper.  In short, not great.  The experience might still rate 4 stars, disregarding the price, if it weren't for the servers.  Fogo de Chao gives you a disk, red on one side and green on the other.  When you want the meat servers to stop by your table, you turn yours to the green side.  If you are not constantly eating, within about 33 seconds, a waiter will pop over and ask if you he can get you something that they haven't brought out in the last two minutes.  This is very nice -- well, it's nice the first six times, but then it gets obvious that they are rushing you.  If you sit around to digest your food, you might eat more.  Heaven forbid!  In any case, $50 just for the buffet and meat is stiff, and the food needs to be really good to warrant it.  It just isn't.

Since there are so many "make-your-own" yogurt places today, you have to judge them against one another.  I like frozen yogurt and I like preparing my own, and I like the taste of the product they have at Yogurtology.  Why the two stars then?  There aren't many differences between these yogurt shops, but where there are differences, Yogurtology falls short.  For example, you have to find someone to give you a sample -- I'm a big boy, I can get my own.  For example, the toppings are numerous but uninspired.  They keep them all completely full - it feels weird, like no one else ever eats here.  The staff tends to be a bit on the surly side.  And it looks like they discontinued 35 cent Tuesday.  On the plus side, the yogurt flavors are pretty good here, and they change often enough to keep it interesting.  I'll go here for my frozen yogurt because its close by my home and I pass it all the time, and once you get your cup made and paid for it tastes good.  But just a little more effort and this could be four or five stars.  Shame.

This review is about both the ballpark and the experience of watching ASU play baseball there.  First the ballpark.  Three stars, baby.  The seats are not very comfortable -- bring a cushion or even a beach towel to sit on.  And forget about shade -- day games in May can be unpleasant.  The food has been consistently mediocre but has improved a bit this year.  The elevated concession area past third base has decent hot dogs, garlic fries, and occasional specials.  Ask for fried onions and peppers on your hot dog.  And if you buy garlic fries, don't sit near me.  As for ASU baseball, five stars -- well most years.  ASU has a consistently talented and interesting baseball team, usually rated in the top 25 and almost always going to the playoffs.  This year, however, no play offs.  Former coach Murphy got caught by the NCAA for recruiting violations.  It takes a lot away from the experience when you have so much less to root for.  But next year everything should be back to normal.  If the weather is nice -- and it usually is for night games after about March 15, and for day games before May -- ASU baseball at Packard Stadium is a truly enjoyable few hours.  Hints:   1.  You can bring your own bottled water (sealed bottles only) and you can bring food, but no other beverages. 2.  Get your tickets ahead - the will call line is long and slow most times, and many popular games sell out. 3.  Most reserved seats are behind a net.  It you don't like nets, try the end sections -- they are still no further out than first and third base. 4.  If you want general admission seats, you will be sitting on a grassy birm.  Bring a folding chair or towel.  And get there early. 5.  Season tickets are a very good deal if you want to go to 15 or more games.

I know very little about shoe repair ... but I know what I like.  I like good workmanship, and I like having working done on time.  Boris Shoe Repair delivered this for me three times in the past six months.  Pricing is the only question mark.  I have not done comparison shopping but I don't think Boris Shoe Repair can be called inexpensive.  I also get the impression that the price may be influenced by how Boris is feeling at the moment, how much you look like you will pay, and whether he thinks he can get more business from you.  Perhaps bargaining?

What  you have in Cartwright's is a pretty standard steakhouse that does everything right and doesn't charge an arm and a leg.  The ambience is typical western and comfortable and the service was fine.  The steaks are pretty good, and I say this based on the "sampler", which is 3 oz. each of beef, buffalo, and elk tenderloin.  These were well prepared and tasty, especially the elk which is as good as any elk I have had anywhere.  The halibut was also perfectly cooked and seasoned.    I wouldn't call Carwright's inexpensive, but for a steak house you usually expect to pay more than $30 for an entree.  Furthermore, you can get 2-for-1 couples, for example using the Preferred Restaurants card.

Tottie's is one of those rare restaurants that does two cuisines well - Thai and Chinese.  They may have gone overboard on the "fusion" part -- the Thai Fried Chicken with Basil and the Chinese General Tsao's Chicken are almost indistinguishable -- but the Thai curry and noodle dishes are distinct anyway.  The three major strengths here are: 1.  The food is uniformly well prepared and tasty.  They have even apparently lost their bread crumbs -- thank goodness -- so the fried dishes are meaty not doughy. 2.  The prices are very low. 3.  The restaurant is far more attractive than you would expect for the type of cuisine and price.  There are some rough spots, however.  Whenever there is any sort of crowd, service slows down - and it can be crowded even on a weeknight.  The menu is not imaginative at all, and many of the dishes are similar to one another.  But when you plunk down $30 for a dinner for two (the entrees are large enough so that you don't need appetisers), including tax and tip, you leave congratulating yourself for being such a clever fellow.  (I told them they should raise their prices).

Revisit 7/27/2013: Unfortunately they have somewhat altered the menu and some of the more innovative (and better) dishes are gone.  The preparation also seems to have suffered.  Perhaps it is just a summer thing.  I hope so.  But I had to take a star away.  Original Review: La Hacienda is not your typical Mexican restaurant -- the menu is very upscale, the prices are high, and the ambiance is that of fine dining.  If you want chicken enchiladas, cheap magueritas, and chips and salsa, there are many other places you can eat.    If you go to La Hacienda, you should be expecting a fine dining experience with Mexican-influenced food.  An example is the Chili Nagano appetizer, which is a spectacular rendition of a southern Mexican staple, blending the flavors of a slightly hot chili pepper with cheese, fruit, tomato, and chicken without any one being overwhelming.  Not all of the food is as good.  The short ribs are great, the slow roasted pork is sometimes a bit dry.  The house marguerita is very good, but the pork belly tacos suffer from an overly-strong salsa.  You get the idea.  How come the five stars, then?  Because even the misses are pretty good and would rate four stars on their own, but the rest of the food, the ambiance, the beautiful setting, and the top notch service make this a five star experience.  It also comes at a five star price.  Locals: you can save about $25 if you have the Preferred Dining card.

This review is solely about the concerts that MIM hosts about once a week, not the museum itself.  MIM has a moderate-sized auditorium (about 300 seats), designed specifically for musical recitals that don't need a large stage.  About once a week, they have such a concert, usually featuring one or a small group of performers playing just about every kind of music conceivable.  I have found their choice of peformers to generally be very good, from international guitarists to an Israeli modern singer, to Irish folk musicians.  You probably have an 80% chance of seeing a very enjoyable show, and it may be a bit different from the usual fare -- another plus.  The venue is as good as it gets -- incomparable acoustics, nice common areas, a display of relevant instruments from the museum collection, and comfortable seats with scads of leg room.  The auditorium is small enough so that all seats are good, but this means that there aren't may seats, so getting them at the beginning of the season is a very good idea.

If you are going to specialize in athletic shoes, you need to have sales personnel who know their stock and can help their customers select the right shoe.  When I visited the Walking Company in Fashion Square mall, this was decidedly not the case.  The lone salesman show no particular interest in helping me and just shrugged his shoulders and walked away when I said that the first pair I tried on wouldn't do.  If he knew anything, he gave no sign of it.  The selection was fair, the store was small but neat and clean, but the service was non-existant.

I won't complain about how expensive the Todd English PUB is, because it is in the Aria hotel and everything is equally overpriced there.  But I will complain about the poor food.  For example, the chicken pot pie had a total of four small pieces of chicken in it -- but that was actually a blessing, because the chicken tasted like boiled cardboard.  The puff pastry on the top was puffy but had no taste of pastry.  That might have been a fluke, you say.  Well, how about the soggy, unflavored, lukewarm fries?  Or the fish and chips where the cook managed to utterly ruin a promising piece of haddock?  Tasteless too.  On the plus side -- the beer selection is impressive and people watching can be fun.  And the popcorn was decent.  I don't expect any improvement in the near future, as the Todd English PUB is crowded most times.  It's amazing what constant hype on hotel TVs and hoards of tourists who don't use Yelp can do.

At about $20, the Wandering Horse Buffet is properly priced for what it is.  Housed in a pleasant setting just off the Talking Stick Casino on your way to the Hotel, the buffet can sometimes be crowded (I'm told) but was not on a weekday evening at dinner time.  Nor were there lineups at the food stations.  As for the food itself, there is substantial variety and also great variation in quality.  Some of it is very good (orange duck legs), some of it reasonable good (steamed shrimp), and some of it almost inedible.  As at most buffets, the trick is to start with little tastes of a lot of things and then return for the best stuff.  The desserts are plentiful and attractive but, again, there is a great variation in quality.  The key lime pie had no lime flavor, but the lemon merangue tart was just about as good as it gets.  They also have top-of-the-line Talenti gelatos.  Because it is a buffet, the fact that there are poor food itemsis not very important because you can avoid them.  In every other way, the Wandering Horse need wander no longer, as far as I am concerned.

Chez Vous Crepes can either be rated 5* or 3*, depending on your expectations.  I choose 5* because I look at Chez Vous as a casual creperie, as indicated by its business hours which do not include dinner.  If you are looking for fine French dining, with each dish packing "WOW" power, you will probably find it modestly disappointing.  But as a destination for a thoroughly enjoyable breakfast or lunch, Chez Vous can scarcely be topped.  The room is bright, clean, inviting, and comfortable, and there is an outdoor patio as well if the weather is fine.  The look, feel, and service would not be out of place in France.  The menu contains a good selection of both sweet and savory crepes, some French-inspired sandwiches such as Croque Monsieur, quiche, and a few salads.  The food is flawlessly executed and does not disappoint in any way except perhaps in inventiveness.  For example, I had a crepe "overstruffed" (no complaint) with ham, Swiss cheese, mushrooms, and creme fraiche.  Whether by design or not, the four ingredients were not completely mixed, so each bite was different, one dominated by salty ham, one by mushrooms, etc., but each having some of the other flavors in it as well.  Delicious!  By all means, give Chez Vous Crepes a try, leave your fine dining expectations in your car, and just enjoy living in Paris for a few minutes.  HINTS: 1.  It gets crowded - try slightly off hours.  If the day is too hot to eat outside, there are only about six or seven tables available. 2.  The dessert crepes do not appear to be as good as the savory ones.  We had a pear crepe and it had no complexity of flavors.  They have other deserts too, such as lemon pie the day we were there - might be worth a try.  Save room. 3.  The salads looked pedestrian but we didn't try one.

I am not a friend or relative, and I have not been asked to write this review. In fact, I rarely review service professionals, but in this case I felt that exceptional service should be acknowledged.  The task was to fix a refrigerator ice maker, which was leaking, producing rusty cubes, and finally had stopped working entirely.  I called Hillside and Leonard, the owner, came out the next day.  He told me it would cost about $500 to replace the rusted ice cube dispenser, replace the ice maker itself, and repair the leak.  I just might want to replace the entire refrigerator, he said, so "call me back and let me know".  We decided on the repair.  Two days later he had bought the necessary parts and returned with an assistant to do the work.  It ended up costing $287. [NOT A TYPO].  That in itself is remarkable.  The reason is that when repairing the leak he determined we didn't need a new ice maker, just the dispenser.  He could easily have installed the ice maker and I would never have known; now he had to return it, on his own time, and he would make nothing for installing it.  I think we call this "honesty" - Diogenes would be thrilled.  It doesn't stop there.  During the installation, he found that the leak had caused a section of wall behind the refrigerator to become moldy - possibly with black mold, which is no joke.  He could have made a bunch of money tearing out and replacing the affected area, but instead he told me that he had to research how to best do it while minimizing the danger from black mold spores both to himself and to my family.  In fact, he said, he might have to have me use a specialist.  But he would find out and let me know.  No charge.  Is this guy for real?  I think he is, and if you need any appliance repaired, including air conditioning, you will be fortunate if you can get Leonard to have a look at it.

Soi 4 deserves four stars which to me means that I will be back - but I don't think I will come back here.  Go figure.  I guess Thai food is not my favorite.  That must be it, because the ambiance, service, and food quality and quantity are pretty darn good here.  The room is new, clean, and modern; the tables are properly spaced; and the noise level is quite acceptable.  I find the chairs uncomfortable after an hour or so and got up with stiff knees but perhaps I'm just getting older (no perhaps about that).  The service was friendly, prompt, and not obtrusive.  Our server, however, did not know the menu well.  The food is the way I image traditional Thai cooking would come out if prepared by a well-trained but non-Thai chef.  The duck in red curry for example was tender and tasty, but the scant curry sauce and four or five mini bites of lychee and pineapple added little.  A crispy chicken dish was better.  The only knock is prices, which are kind of weird.  Beer, wine ($10 for an indifferent glass), cocktails, and appetizers are expensive.  Entrees are reasonable, sometimes even surprisingly low-priced.  At happy hour the drinks are reduced, and a small selection of appetisers is $5, which alleviates this problem.  Happy hour is 5 - 6:30 (not sure about weekends), and you must order by 6:30 to get the lower price.  So if you are here for happy hour, or if you don't drink and don't want starters, Soi 4 is quite reasonably priced, but otherwise your check can mount up to the point where the value proposition just isn't there.

Citizen Public House is a very popular fine dining establishment with a brew pub atmosphere.  The food is uniformly well-prepared, tasty, and attractively-presented.  The portions tend towards large, especially the rack of lamb which has about a pound of meat in it. The service is exemplary; the staff really tries to provide whatever you need (or think you need) and with genuine warmth instead of a frozen smile.  Should be five stars.  But what's the story, Richie?    Well, the story is that Citizen Public House doesn't measure up completely as a five-star fine food establishment.  The food is not innovative and the flavor profiles are simple.  Worse, it is just too darn LOUD!!  Noisy restaurants are a "style" today, but not my style.  On the other hand, Citizen Public House doesn't qualify as a five star casual eatery, because the prices are too high.  I really would like to sample the cuisine again, but I am not willing to subject myself to the audio assault (if you use a hearing aid and can turn it off, it might be okay).  I would like to go when it is not crowded, but apparently that is never -- be sure you make reservations.

This review is for dinner.  La Petite France is as close to an authentic French cafe as you are likely to find in the Southwest.  The cuisine consists primarily of a French version of pizza, with creme fraiche substituted for pizza sauce, crepes, and a small number of traditional French entrees such as Coq Au Van -- these vary from day to day.  The chef is clearly more than competent and most of the menu is delicious.  There are occasional misses.  For example, the snapper was very underseasoned and a bit rubbery (could have been too old).  But a crostini-like appetizer and a dessert crepe were as good as it gets.  La Petite France is the kind of 4 star place that you go back to frequently despite the occasional only-average dishes, not because it's cheap, which it isn't, but because the food is different without being "experimental".    Hints: 1.  They have a $29.95 "dinner" consisting of your choice of appetizer, entree, and dessert which is a very large discount. 2.  If the weather is decent, try to get outdoor seating.  The patio does not face a road or shopping center and is quite pleasant.

The Desert Oasis is a modern fine dining restaurant (well prepared food without the extensive use of expensive ingredients) run by the Culinary Arts school at Scottsdale Community College.  This is a top notch cooking program, and the students, supervised by excellent chefs, do the cooking and serving at Desert Oasis.  And they do it very well.  You will get a 5 course fixed price meal for about $21!  This will include a choice of appetiser, choice of soup, choice of salad, choice of entree, and choice of dessert.  There will be 2-5 choices for each.  The menu changes weekly so there is no point in reviewing specific dishes, but the worst of the ten that my wife and I experienced was good, and over half were excellent.  Service is genuine if not polished, partly because the servers will be or were recently the cooks, and they really care what you think.  I thought the pace was a shade fast, but it took 1 hour and 25 minutes for the five courses, so maybe we were just enjoying ourselves.    The Desert Oasis is only open when school is in session, so it will close for the summer in May and reopen in October or so.  They serve three or four days a week.  The menus for the season are published in late summer.  You must make reservations way in advance, as the popular menus sell out almost at once.  Here are some hints: 1.  The Desert Oasis is on a reservation and no alcohol is permitted. 2.  They used to mail menus out to people on their mailijng list but this is being discontinued.  Go to their website and sign up for email alerts.  That is about the only way you will know when they have opened up the new season for reservations. 3.  There will be about six different menus which will be rotated throughout the year.  Pick out the one or ones you like and go early in the season.  You may want to come back and you will need to get those reservations in way ahead for most menus. 4.  The restaurant has a sign out front but is hard to find.  It is on the Scottsdale Community College campus.  From the 101, take the third entrance (they are numbered) and go through the parking lot (lot H)  towards the North.  You will run into a building.  Look for the sign.

Surprisingly good for a kosher restaurant, especially for one that is not a deli.    Mozart Cafe is a dairy restaurant, meaning that no meat or meat products of any kind are used.  This is necessitated by their being kosher, which does not allow the mixing of meat and dairy products.  If you are a devoted vegetarian, you can be absolutely certain that there is nothing that was ever in an animal used by Cafe Mozart, assured by the strictest Rabbinic supervision.  On the other hand, if you are a carnivore and insist on meat protein, you will have to try somewhere else.  Absent that, just about everyone should enjoy what Mozart Cafe has to offer.    For a small storefront, the menu is extensive.  The Ciabatta bread used for the paninis is excellent, and the combination of flavors that Mozart Cafe achieves with no meat and little cheese is almost miraculous.  I haven't tried everything else, but the other sandwiches and salads look really good, and all of the other diners were cleaning their plates.  There is also a breakfast menu.  The downsides have nothing to do with the food.  For starters, Mozart Cafe is very basic so forget ambiance.  But it is clean and bright, and the tables are not crowded together past reason.  The service is extremely warm but sometimes you can wait a bit.  And, of course, there is no meat.  I would also say that it is a tad expensive -- kosher restaurants usually are, but that is because kosher meat is expensive, and the Mozart Cafe doesn't use any.  They also cannot open on Friday night or Saturday, so they have to make up for it by charging more.  Whatever the reason, a sandwich here will cost you about $10.  They also have an instore bakery with traditional Jewish cookies and breads.  I tried two varieties, both very good.  These too are a bit expensive.

This is a thoroughly competent "rice bowl" establishment, with a somewhat expanded menu.  It differs from fast food places you might find in shopping malls in several ways: 1.  A greater portion of the food is prepared to order and is thus fresher. 2.  There is an expanded menu, including not only teriyaki rice bowls, but also tempura, popular sushi rolls, etc. 3.  The food quality is a bit better.  Prices are reasonable, but not cheap.  And you need to realize that this is an "order at the counter" place, although they do bring your food to your table.  It ain't fancy, folks.  But for what it is, Yogis Grill is about as good as you are likely to find.  Hint:  Look for coupons on the Internet, in mailers, etc.

Update note: On 5/24/2016 we revisited Tommy V's and it was great once again except the lamb chops, which had an off flavor and consistency.  This is a real puzzle considering the quality of everything else.  Perhaps this is not their best item.  I am getting pretty selective as to where I bestow five stars, and Tommy V's did not have that Wow! factor that I usually want to see.  But it got straight A's in almost everything else.  Located in downtown Scottsdale, Tommy V's is a modern space with not much of an Italian look.  But it is bright, clean, not too noisy, comfortable and has a pretty good view for an "urban" kitchen.  The service was perfect -- quick, friendly, but not overbearing.  Everything we ate was at least pretty good, and the Pappardelle and the Cannoli were excellent.  But without anything to make you jump up and down with glee, Tommy V's also had to score well on value to justify the top rating.  And it did.  For the area (note qualification), it is quite reasonably priced, including even the drinks.  HINT:  I hear it has a great happy hour, but we missed that.  HINT:  Parking may be a bit tough in season on weekends.

I have used competent plumbers before, and I have used relative inexpensive plumbers before, but Gabe (who IS Copperline Plumbling) is the first one is 20 years who is both.  The work he did for me was routine, but nonetheless I can see that he does a lot of the "little" things right, such as:  1.  He will not do work that does not meet at least current standards -- in my case this meant bringing obsolete cutoff connections up to code. 2.  Patiently explained what he needed to do to my wife and how much it would cost BEFORE he did it. 3.  Warned about a possible adverse consequence of a certain repair and got my ok before proceding.  Plumbers are never cheap, but my bill was $204 and that covered almost two hours of work and the parts (I estimated about $60 worth).  Gabe did not charge me for travel time either.  I hate to give this good review because he will now become busier and I'll have to stand in line when I need something, but you can't help wanting to root for this guy.

The Fountain Hills Festival of the Arts is a couple of cuts above most of its kind.  First, its bigger.  Plan on spending at least an hour and half just to gaze into each booth.  The vendors also tend to be more creative and artistic than the norm -- there are some very glaring exceptions of course.  The food is varied and a few places have gone beyond normal fair food.  Try the pumpkin chocolate chip cookies at the Talking Stick resort booth.  The setting is also superior, as the festival is located right on the shores of the Fountain Hills lake, and the fountain display itself can be seen on the hour from the entire festival.  In nice weather, early in the day, strolling around the fair can reach five star status.  On the down side: about 2/3 of the booths are overpriced, some grotesquely.  But do not dispair -- hunt for those bargains and you will find them.  Hint:  if you go after about 11:30 on the weekend, be prepared for overcrowding, and possibly problems parking.

The Soul Cafe is trying, but unfortunately they are not yet succeeding.  What they appear to be trying to be is a fine dining experience with a casual atmosphere and an interesting menu that leans towards comfort food.  The prices reflect this, but there are problems with every aspect of the restaurant.  1.  Ambiance - the Soul Cafe is new, clean, and attractive.  The tables, however, especially in the main area, are extremely close together.  They have put a small band (2 players) and a tiny dance floor in the middle of the space.  When there is music, it is very loud in parts of the restaurant and virtually inaudible elsewhere.  Where it is loud people try to talk over the music and the result is a very noisy eating environment.  Whatsmore, the music consists of standard ballads and is just a touch better than the piped-in variety  2.  Service - they didn't have our reservation, so I showed them the e-mail confirmation.  "Oh", they said "Open Table - we have trouble with them."  I noted that it was their choice to put Open Table on their website.  The response was to put us on the list of people without reservations - at the bottom of the list.  We had to call the manager to even get a table.  Once we did, the waitress was formally polite but generally uncaring and inattentive (for example, no water; did not replace our used silverware after the appetiser; generally nowhere in sight).  All of this might have been overlooked were in not for #3.  3.  Food - the menu is interesting but the execution is ... well, it's poor.  For example, the trout was totally unseasoned and bland.  Someone had made the shrimp-wrapped bacon by slapping a piece of bacon on a shrimp and burning it -- no sauce, no flavor -- could have been done by a five-year old.  The flatbread was soggy, the cheese was tasteless, the pepperoni was tasteless (they use the large deli-style which is not as heavily seasoned as the smaller format).  I guess it takes talent to make a totally flavorless pepporoni pizza, so you could say they have a talented chef.   My advice: keep the building, lose the music, spread out the tables, train your servers, get real cooks, and create a reservation system that works.  For now, the second star is only because of the effort.

For those of you who have written good reviews about Jasmine Tokyo -- you've got to be kidding!  Although the dining area is comfortable and clean, and the people who clean your table are friendly and attentive, there is a big problem -- the FOOD!  I don't know what good a large selection of sushi does you if it isn't very good.  Of the eight types I sampled, one was decent (crispy onion tuna, despite having only a tiny morsel of fish).  The other seven were fair.  A big problem is that even at 6pm, when things should be really fresh, they weren't.  The tempura was very oily, the non-fish dishes (orange chicken, chicken with mushrooms, broccoli beef) were nowhere near as tasty as those you get at a shopping center food court.  And how did Jasmine Tokyo manage to make roasted duck with skin that was crispy and chewy at the same time?  (I'll tell you how -- it had been sitting around for hours).  Seasoning is not a talent of the food preparers (I will not call them chefs) -- the spicy tuna was not spicy, nothing had salt or other condiments that I could discern, and so on and so on and so on.  Don't save your appetite for desert -- it is pedestrian at best and has nothing to do with the Orient.  A few things were okay, namely those where good ingredients and decent recipes are all that is needed -- the plain shrimp, the custard, the hot and sour soup.  That's about it.  $22 for this?? Even with 20% off, it's still at least $10 overpriced.

Barrio Queen is a more or less tranditional Mexican restaurant, done in upscale tones, and set in a fairly nice part of downtown Scottsdale.  About half of the tables are outside with views of the shops and, depending on the time of day, people walking by.    The thing that distinguishes Barrio Queen is that they have talent in the kitchen.  Everything we tried was a surprise, usually a good one.  This is a magic restaurant - nothing is what it seems.    For example, the Menudo is actually a much harder to find and exotic dish - Pata y Mondongo - tripe and calves' hooves.  Served in a slightly spicy tomato broth, it is exceptional.  Then there is the Chile Verde, a large portion of remarkably tender chunks of pork with a few onions and chilis, cilantro sprinkled on top, and just enough broth to keep it moist.  Nearly a meal in itself, it is a far cry from most chiles you will get in restaurants.  The Chiles en Nogado is a stuffed chili with a mixture of chicken chunks, dried apricot, onion, and garlic.  The surprise here is that the other ingredients listed on the menu were present, if at all, in only tiny amounts.  The result was a dish with good but simple flavor, lacking the complexities it should have.  The sauce was a overly-mild cream sauce with a couple of slivered almonds and added nothing.  Still it was enjoyable for what it was, just a bit disappointing for $22.  The only real miss was the Tres Leches dessert.  Once more a surprise but this time a very bad one.  This is really strawberry shortcake with just enough condensed milk (or something) to make the flavorless pound cake into a mush resembling bad oatmeal.  If not for this, I could have given Barrio Queen five stars.  HINT:  This place is busy even on weekdays.  If outside seating is not attractive due to heat, cold, wind, or rain, you very likely will have to wait.  As far as I can tell, they do not take reservations.  Parking can also be a problem.

If you've a hankering for southern cooking, but you want a cook with more skills than tossing a slab of meat into a smoker, try Grassroots Kitchen.  They walk the line between fine dining and comfort food better than anyplace else I've been to.  Its really good -- but it's not great.  Take the BBQ brisket, for example.  The platter has thick slices of meet (about 1/4 inch thick!) which is just too thick for brisket -- it becomes chewy.  But the spicing, flavor, and thin layer of fat was perfect.  I enjoyed it despite wearing out my mandibles.  The blackened redfish was perfectly cooked but somewhat underspiced, at least by my standards which equates blackened with spicy.  The sides were all good but not great: beans-nothing special, grits-where were those jalapenos?, etc.  Best dish was the soup - a beef chili that had amazing flavor.  I ordered only a cup and wanted more.  Pricing is also between fine dining and comfort food.  I'm pretty sure you will enjoy your experience here, if you can get a reservation.

Now here's an odd review -- two stars but I still recommend you give it a try!  Read on...  Ike's is located just on the Phoenix side of McDonald's on your way through Wickenberg, and it is an alternative to fast food -- not a dining "experience" but not just a grab-and-go.  Located in an octagonal log "cabin", Ike's is small but clean.    The menu is limited and consists mainly of burgers, hot dogs, fries, and chili.  They have a few other items as well, but you get the idea.  My burger, however, was overcooked and dry, and the fries were soggy.  Thus the two stars.  On the other hand, the chili was good and the food was of decent quality.  Ike's was two mistakes away from being four stars - perhaps you can give it a go and let us know if my experience was a fluke.

Gordon Ramsay Steak is an expensive restaurant - don't expect to spend under $100 per person and probably more.  As such it needs to be perfect, and it isn't.  On the plus side, the steaks were flavorful and the meat quality couldn't be beat.  The service was impeccable, the side dishes top notch, and the water glass constantly refilled. The breads were A-1.  One of our two drinks - a sidecar - was excellent (they use apricot jam but it was still fine), but now to the minuses.  .  The other drink was pedestrian at best - almost tasteless despite fresh mint and lime.  Their American Kobe beef was very tasty but their standard variety was no better than less costly places.  The music was too modern for my taste and so loud at times that conversation was difficult (the volume kept going up and down).  Even our waiter had trouble hearing our order.  On balance, Steak was a good experience and better than almost any other restaurant I have been to this year, but even for Las Vegas, it was expensive.  Only a personal visit from Gordon Ramsay would have made it a good value, but alas he was not present.

Even if Afghan food is not in your general comfort zone, you really should give Khyber Halal a chance.  Small ethnic restaurants are not always attractive, comfortable, or even clean, but Khyber excels in all of these areas.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  The menu is varied but not so large as to make you suspicious about how much frozen food is served - I believe everything here is freshly prepared.  The portions are large, the prices are low, and the food is nearly as good as it gets for this type of establishment.  So how could Khyber be better?: Well, I wish they were located in my neighborhood, and the food could be spiced a little more heavily, particularly as regards salt.  Other than that ... well I gave it five stars.  I can particularly recommend the Mantoo, a kind of ravioli dish with meat-stuffed dumplings in a surprisingly good beef-yogurt sauce.  The "Salad" (for under $2) is a large portion of a cucumber-tomato-onion chopped salad, and is a perfect relish for the Mantoo.  There are a number of vegitarian dishes served with Nan.  We had the Bamya (okra) which needed salt but was otherwise perfectly prepared.  The Nan here is thick, like a thick-crust pizza, and they give you enough to make a meal of on its own.  If you have room for dessert, I can recommend the Phirni - a pudding whose ingredients we were told are secret, but it tastes like a cross between rice pudding and custard and is superb.  I have to return to try the kebabs and some of the other specialties.  The pictures on the menu and the website are helpful and accurate, so you really know what you are getting.  Maybe I shouldn't raise your expectations too much only to have you disappointed.  See for yourself.  What are you risking? -- For two people, we had two delicious somasas for an appetiser, two main courses, a huge plate of Afghan rice, a side salad, and a dessert for $33 including tax and tip.  I've paid much more for much less.

This is a "must visit" place if you are anywhere near the Bellagio.  It is laid out in a circle, with servers and showcases on the inside, and displays of candies and cookings lining the outside.  A huge chocolate fountain at the entrance beckons you to the gelato and pastries section, or continue around the circle to the baked goods, sandwiches, crepes, and drinks.  There are so many great items, the most useful thing I can do is list some of the best:  French Pastries:  virtually everything -- they are just as good as they look Baked goods:  cheese danish, almond brioche (the muffin like items are somewhat disappointing) Sandwiches:  tuna, chicken pesto, spicy chicken tomato (make sure you tell them to grill the sandwich even though it takes seven minutes) Crepes:  anything will be fine -- watch them make a few to see what they are like Candies: extremely expensive; good but probably not good enough for the price Gelato: just gelato  Great for breakfast or lunch or an after meal dessert.

I have now used Above All Pool Care a few times over the past couple of years, and am continually impressed.  Not only do I receive prompt and courteous service, but the work is done completely and professionally, and the charges are more than reasonable.  For example: my pool filtering (both skimmer and floor unit) was working very poorly and often stopping entirely.  Above All could have told me anything that wanted and I wouldn't know if they were gaming me or not, particularly since it was necessary to take the filter motor apart.  Problem was a stone lodged in the impeller, but if they had said I needed a new filter motor I would never have suspected anything.  In any case, the stone was removed, and while he was there, Ken (who = Above All Pool Care as far as I can tell) also fixed a minor seal problem, inspected and repaired the weir (door to the skimmer) which was sticking, and, just for laughs, replaced a couple of other cracked pieces.  He left the filter running and by the time I got home, the pool was pristine.  The bill came today for $128, which included $30 in parts and tax.  No matter what criteria you use to judge service companies -- availability, courtesy, professional ability, honesty -- Above All is above all.  Nope: not a relative or friend.

Davanti Enoteca joins the very small group of restaurants serving fine food in attractive surroundings at reasonable (sort of ) prices.  The cuisine is certainly Italian, but not like what you would find in a traditional Italian establishment -- this is more like what you would expect in one of the trendy restaurants in Bologna.  For example: there is a bruscheta on the menu but there are also four "Vasi"s which are more inventive dips served with toasted Italian bread.  We had the cannelloni (bean) and onion variety (the beans were pureed, and you spread it over the bread).  Davanti serves "sharing" style, meaning that dishes come out one or two at a time and the table is assumed to be sharing them.  If you and your companion each order an entree, they may not come out at the same time.  This presents Davanti with a challenge in pacing the meal -- but they manage to keep the food flowing without having dishes pile up at any one time.  It also gives you a lot of changes to interact with your dining companions.  Three of the five dishes we ordered were five star, and the other two still pretty good.  I think the pizzas are there least successful offerings -- perhaps they don't have the right oven and so the crust is chewy not crispy.  The faro salad was spectacular.  The asparagus came with tiny bits of rhubarb -- nice touch.  And the chocolate budino dessert was right on target: a not-overly-rich chocoate mousse/pudding with toasted marshmallow.  As a wine bar, Davanti has a good selection of wines by the glass, and both of the ones we had were outstanding.  The wines are not cheap, at about $10 a glass, but the pour is generous and you can get larger pours for slightly more.  The food dishes run from around $7 to $13, and two per person is sufficient, so the total for us was under $100 for two, including tax and tip.  Two suggestions: 1.  Reservations on weekends are probably needed. 2.  Build you meal from the starters -- vasis, boards, appetizers, and salads, and then add a pasta or pizza.  You don't need to emphasize the "main courses".

Tavern Americana delivers what it promises nearly flawlessly.  To start with, Tavern Americana is exactly as the name implies - a tavern-like setting serving American tavern-like food.  There is a bar and a bar eating area with high-top tables, and an adjacent standard dining area with booths and tables.  Both are noisy, but not so bad that you can't have a conversation.  Everything is new and perfectly clean.  The service is prompt, friendly, and attentive to just the right degree.  The prices are surprisingly moderate.  And the food is spot on - at least what we tasted, which included a flavorful pizza, a salad, and a burger (good, but the least successful of the lot due to under-seasoning).  But it is the "little" things which differentiate Tavern Americana from the crowd.  For example, the beer was properly chilled and poured correctly (just the right head).  For example, when we ordered a half salad and split that, they brought it in two bowls with a separate dressing cup for each.  And, I didn't have to ask for ketchup (home-made I believe).  Hint: We went on a Wednesday evening and it was full but not overflowing.  Reservations are a good idea any day of the week.

Caveat: I have eaten at several Ethiopian restaurants but am not an expert in this cuisine.  So let me write my review in the form of questions.  1.  Should the injera (the soft flat bread that is served with just about everything) be overwhelmingly sour? 2.  Should virtually all of the meat and vegetarian dishes be hot enough to burn one's mouth a bit, but be otherwise devoid of flavor? 3.  Should pictures on the wall be askew, tables have prominent number stands as a centerpiece, and the ambient air temperature be about 90 degrees?  If you answer yes to these questions, Gojo is for you.  If not, you might object to the pricing as well, which is rather high for an atmosphereless, local, ethnic restaurant.  Note: The second star is for pleasant service and decent sambussas.

Thinking about going here for a before-show dinner some evening?  You might want to think again.  Gertrude's is set up as a fine dining restaurant but it falls short in lots of ways.  First: ambiance -- Gertrude's is located near the entrance to the Desert Botanical Garden in an area that used to be part of the gift shop.  It still looks like an empty retail space with tables and chairs arranged in rows.  Besides having the warmth of a high school cafeteria, Gertrude's is incredibly noisy.  Strike one. Note: There is also a more inviting outside dining area if the weather is cool enough.    Second: service -- the kitchen is way too slow.  We arrived almost an hour and a half before our show time to find a 1/3-filled restaurant.  Our server asked if we had to get out in time for a show and we told her.  Thirty minutes later our appetizers arrived.  Thirty-five minutes after that I was ready to walk out because there was scarcely time left to eat before our show.  Our server kept telling us just a few more minutes.  In the end we got our main courses barely in time to eat them, and certainly with no time for dessert.  Strike two.  Third: food - spotty.  For example, the pork trio had delicious thinly-sliced leg, but the sausage was blank and the pork loin dried out.  The short ribs were blah.  The burrata appetiser was very small for the price, and the bread (you need to order it separately for about $6) was a berry loaf of some kind that didn't work well with anything else we ordered.  That's right - no free bread.  Strike three.  Good points:  The price was halfway reasonable for fine dining.  Too bad this wasn't fine dining, which is after all about a total experience and not just the food.  A couple of the items we were served were very tasty.  The Desert Botanical Garden itself is fabulous.  That's about it.  Sorry.

Burger joints that purport to be something special abound these days, and burgers are on the menu in many "fine" restaurants.  Is Smashburger any different?  I guess not.  Its menu is burgers.  You can pick the toppings.  They have french fries and sweet potato fries, shakes, drinks, and a few salads.  But Smashburger has an edge on most of its competitors - the burgers themselves are juicy and tasty.  This may be because they use (they say) fresh meat, "smashed" to order.  Also a bit above average: the bacon, the fries, the courtesy of the order takers.  With no outstanding negatives to offset these, Smashburger moves up into the four star range, as compared to other burger joints.  When will it all end?

Kitchen 18 is strictly Kosher and this means it starts out with limitations: 1)  It cannot be open Friday evening or Saturday. 2)  It can use meat products or milk products, but not both (Kitchen 18 uses meat). 3)  It cannot use pork or shellfish or a number of other foods which are not kosher. 4)  Even for permitted foods, like beef, it must use only certified Kosher versions, which can be more expensive and sometimes hard to get.  The 4-star rating reflects these limitations.  Furthermore, Kitchen 18 is not your usual Kosher deli.  Rather it features Middle Eastern cuisine and thus should be judged as a neighborhood ethnic restaurant.  That said, the dining experience here is pretty good.  The food is always properly prepared, attractively presented, and tasty.  The menu is limited but has enough variety so that you will surely find something. Many people think the chicken shnitzel is the best dish but also consider the Bowtie pasta bolognese which is very meat. The ambiance is casual but comfortable.  And, for a kosher restaurant, it's very reasonably priced.  If you only eat kosher, this is probably the best choice in the Phoenix area.  If you are not kosher but like Middle Eastern food, it's worth a try because of the friendly, casual atmosphere and the reasonable price.  HINTS:  The hummous needs lemon!  If you order it ask for a couple of lemon wedges and mix the juice in.  Surprising - since the chef seems to be very talented. The pita bread served with many items is the best I have ever found.  You can also buy it packaged at the adjacent store.

Kitchen 18 has evolved significantly since my previous review.  It remains a cheerful, comfortable, clean place to relax and eat a meal.  The service time has improved and the staff is friendly but not intrusive.  The big change is the food.  At my last two visits, every item on my plates was very well prepared and properly seasoned, from the schnitzel to the baba ghanouj (especially good) to the vegetables, bean soup, Israeli salad, ... you name it.  Don't expect gourmet, but expect your meal to be just what you thought it should be.  Oh, yes, prices are still low, especially for kosher.

There is no way EVO is a four star restaurant -- it is either three stars or five, but I don't know which.  If that seems strange, consider Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  So here it is - there is no complaint about the ambiance (comfortable although dark) or service (though a tad slow, it was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable), and the prices are low enough so that EVO is actually a good value for the area (except that they charge for bread).  So obviously the issue is the food.  I will focus on two pasta dishes.  I do believe their claim that they make their pasta from scratch each day.  And my wife loved the Paccheri - thin flat pasta with roasted cauliflower, olive oil, and parmesan.  Five stars, hooray!  But my Orecchiette was off in many respects: the escarole (was that really escarole?) was raw, in large chunks, and had no place in this dish.  Use slightly cooked broccolini instead perhaps.  The sausage was good, but the kitchen must have been rushed, so I got four large chunks that I had to cut, and a scarcity of crumbles in the rest of the dish.  Surely you can spend the time to evenly crumble your sausage.  As to the pasta itself -- the orecchetti -- it is usually a round flat pasta with an indentation in the center that gets deliciously coated with sauce, but here it had rolled up and looked like macaroni.  And the sauce, largely olive oil, had too much lemon in it.  A total miss.  So which are you, EVO - paccheri or orecchiette?  Maybe there's one good cook and one bad cook.  It's a mystery.  I will have to return to solve it, and also to check out the imaginative antipasti (would you believe a beef heart sandwich, bone marrow, tripe parmesan).

It's a little storefront.  You order at a counter and about 15 minutes later (it will be freshly prepared) someone brings you your food.  You fill you own soda and iced tea. The menu is limited almost exclusively to fish, shrimp, and calamari, prepared either fried or as tacos.  How can Coconut's possibly earn five stars??  The answer is in two words -- fish tacos.  You get two to an order for about $10, served on individual plates.  At dinner, one filled me up about 3/4 of the way, so you can order soup, salad, or a side dish and share.  But you may prefer overstuffing yourself to giving up that second taco.  The staff will proudly inform you that there are 17 ingredients in a taco, but by itself that doesn't prove anything.  What's important here is that there are not one or two, but three distinct components that shine through, each one a superstar.  #1 - the fish, which is a mixture of grilled ono and mahi-mahi.  #2 - the cole slaw, chunks of cabbage with coconut milk (no mayo).  #3 - fresh mango pieces.  The other 14 ingredients no doubt are also contributers to the overall flavor.  You pick up the taco with your hands so that you get a mixture of ingredients in each bite, dripping juice and dribbling tomato pieces onto your plate, grinning from ear to ear, and not talking to anyone while the flavor lasts.  I can't say quite as much for the other menu items.  For example, the fish and chips is okay, with the fish being the same fine ono and mahi-mahi but the preparation being indifferent deep frying.  The chips (french fries), however, are almost as good as McDonalds, and that's saying something.  I still have to try the coconut shrimp, chowder, and a couple of other sides ... if I can ever find the room.

Firefly is a more than competent tapas place with a lot going for it.  The decor is comfortable but perhaps a bit dark - nothing special.  And the service is friendly and very prompt, maybe even too prompt; if you want your dinner paced, you will have to do it yourself (see hint below).  But in every other respect, Firefly excels.  Every item on the menu that we tried was very good to excellent.  No misses at all, and some were really outstanding, most notably the baked goat cheese and (believe it or not) the Chicago beef bocadillos.  The San Gria was above average too.  The menu is large and has a wide variety of selections.  You will want to order 20 or so, but two per person is enough for an average appetite.  The prices are quite reasonable, with a typical plate being well under $10.  Go hungry.    HINTS: 1.  Reservations are really necessary. 2.  From the time you order to the time you get your food will vary from a few minutes to about ten.  Each plate will be brought separately, so you really need to share.   3.  To pace your meal, order one or two dishes, sit around eating and talking, and when you are ready, order a couple more.  They are fine with you doing this.

Twisted Rose has a lot of pluses and a few glaring minuses, so, depending on what is important to you, it is anywhere from 2 to 5 stars.    The good stuff:  They actually cook here.  For example the french fries are clearly home-made, fresh and tasty.  The fish in fish-and-chips is hand-battered in house, and the fish was a premium selection - halibut.  Three good size chunks of fish plus the fries for $12 is a bargain if it tastes good.  And at Twisted Rose it does.  The chicken picatta was also very tasty, although the chicken was a shade on the tough side.  The faro salad would have been exceptional except that it was served on a flood of whipped goat cheese that looked and unfortunately tasted a lot like mayonnaise.  The service was attentive - maybe a bit too much so - and the ambiance was comfortable rather than luxurious.  Sounds like five stars, but ...  The bad stuff:  Most of the wines are Gold Petal brand, and the one I had, the Chenin Blanc, was not very good -- over acidic with no aftertaste but acid and sulfite.  Other than these house wines, there are only about a dozen unimpressive selections.    Prices vary, with some good values and some not so good.  Some plates are large and some are a bit small.  You'll just have to sort it out.  Overall, I will be back to try a couple of other menu items and maybe give the wine another chance.  HINT:  Happy hour is 3 to 6:30 weekdays, but it isn't much of a bargain foodwise.  Appetizers are all $2 off, but that's not a lot when a shrimp cocktail goes from $12 to $10.  However, the pulled pork slider is discounted from $4 to $2 and it is a bargain.

You might not like Basic & Garlic Bistro.  It is about as far removed from fine dining as you can get without being fast food.  The restaurant is small and simply decorated, but it is clean and it has tables with tableclothes and comfortable chairs.  The couple who own and run it are young and probably make mistakes from time to time.  But they are enthusiastic, they try hard, and the food is REALLY GOOD.  You can get pizza by the slice for $1.85 plus 35 cents (that's no typo) for each topping.  Get one topping - they put on plenty.  These slices are 1/8 of a 16-inch pie, so two will fill me up but I could eat three or four if I had to.  That makes for a pretty cheap dinner.  That's the best buy on the menu -- other choices are moderately priced but not ridiculously inexpensive.  The pizza is very thin crust, fairly crisp, and covered in a standard mozzarella cheese.  The pepperoni topping was the usual, the sausage appeared to be homemade and was mild but delicious, and the meatball was just about as good as it gets.  It all worked together to make a fine old-time pizza.  My wife had a sub which came on freshly baked and crusty bread that had her insisting that I try a piece because it was SO good.  When she got full, she ate the sandwich filling, which she said was even better than the bread.  This is a neighborhood affordable Italian eatery.  Cut them some slack.  For what they try to be, they are as good as it gets, and that is plenty good enough to have me coming back.

When you walk into Hopdoddy you are greated by a perky hostess who assigns you a table and gives you a menu.  When you choose, you order at a counter and then they bring the food to you.  Oddly, our french fries were served before I even got back to the table, but the burgers took 20 minutes.    In any case the fries were above average, thin cut and crisp, so we had high hopes for the main course.  My wife had the lamb burger, which did not taste like lamb at all - pretty ordinary and bland.  But my bison burger was anything but bland.  I really couldn't taste the meat, or the bacon, or the tomato, or the cheese.  Everything was overwhelmed by what I take to be a hot sauce they sprinkled irregularly on top.  No, it wasn't fiery hot -- it was terminally sour.  And not pleasantly sour like citrus, but sour like spoiled milk.    $10 may not seem much for a burger these days, but Hopdoddy does not give you value for your money -- not in the burgers nor in the rather small size portion of fries.  Try somewhere else.

After my previous review, the manager contacted me and sent me $35 in gift cards, so I had to try it again. It turns out that with careful ordering, you can get a pretty good meal here but there are still rough edges.  Specifically -- 1.  Stick to the plain beef hamburger and add a couple of simple extras if you want.  Lettuce, tomato, onions, sassy sauce -- these are fine but the hot sauce is sour, the bacon gets lost in the other flavors, and the chili is a mushy mess. (The egg bun is doughy; try the whole wheat). 2.  Eat your fries as an appetizer as they suggest - they come out crisp but quickly get soggy. 3.  Make sure you tell them what you want served first, if not the fries.  The salads are quite good and you might choose this as your starter.  They are a better value than the $5 fries. 4.  The draft beer is cold and the serving is large - one of the better values in a restaurant that is a shade overpriced on some items.

Once upon a time, food trucks were only expected to be convenient.  Everyone knew the food would be only so-so -- after all, how good could you cook in a truck.  But nowadays, food truck food can be, and often is, fresh, tasty, well-prepared, and delicious.    Not so for Whiskey Ranch BBQ, at least not when I experienced it at the Scottsdale Art Festival.  The main problem was the brisket, which they served chopped into tiny cubes, completely ruining the texture of the meat.  Furthermore it was grainy and a bit chewy.  The beans were overly-sweet, and the potato salad an odd combination of mayo and vinegar flavors, possibly a bit spoiled.  Only the BBQ sauce and the paint job on the truck were top notch.

Naya is an attractive-looking restaurant with a modern feel and a great deal of eye appeal.  When you walk in, you can't help but think "this is going to be a great meal".  Unfortunately, ours wasn't.  Besides the ambiance, there are some outstandingly strengths at Naya -- the menu is  more imaginative than the usual kabobs and gyros, the rice and vegetable sides dishes were unusually tasty, and our dessert (selected from a tray) was A+.  Somebody knows how to cook.  Unfortunately, that somebody did not cook the proteins on our main courses -- steak and chicken kabobs.  The steak was underdone inside, burnt outside.  The chicken was so overcooked and dry that I literally couldn't eat three of the pieces.  Neither was seasoned so you could tell.  Perhaps the problem is an overly-hot grill, lack of marination, and a salt shaker with clogged holes.  In any case, when you ruin the main course, it kind of messes up the whole meal.  There were two other problems as well -- the restaurant, though laid out with lots of open space, was very noisy.  And the service was spotty -- our order was taken promptly and the appetiser came out in 15 minutes (okay since it had to be freshly baked), but then the main courses took 30+ minutes and the dessert, 25.  If we had not had a coupon, the check would have been $70 for one appetiser, two main courses (not the expensive ones), one dessert, and no drinks.  That would have been okay but maybe a bit high even if the meats were properly prepared.  But they weren't, so I left feeling that "we was robbed".  Yet I almost want to return - these problems could be fixed and Naya could be a stunner.

There is no question the BBQ is great here.  There is also no question that you will wait in line.  The only thing I can add to previous reviews is how to estimate the length of your wait.  Once you get inside, you've got about five minutes before you have your food.  Add to that about one and a half minutes for each person you see in line outside (or sitting next to the line).  Good luck.

SugarJam is that rare (almost unique) combination of a bakery and a BBQ spot.  It is located in a small office complex space, and is really barely big enough to be either.  The result is that the excellent food is somewhat compromised by the non-existent ambiance and the very small selection.   For example, for lunch, you basically have sliced turkey, bbq chopped brisket, or bbq pulled pork.  Now both the brisket and pork were great, the beans exemplary, and even the bread far above average, but I wish they gave me more choices so I could come back a few times -- maybe sliced brisket, bbq chicken or salmon, etc.  Similarly there are only a few bakery selections and only a very few of each.  If someone comes in before you and orders peach pie you are out of luck.  I wish SugarJam the best of fortune and hope they grow into what they can be.

Toro Latin is a new restaurant that occupies the space that was once the TPC Grille, overlooking the TPC golf course, and with a small outdoor patio that benefits from green grass, a lake in the background, and our beautiful Arizona sunsets.  The food and service have to compete with nature, and they both did so successfully on our visit.  Our group started with a couple of salads (the Toro Salad is huge), and the crunchy shrimp, all great especially the shrimp.  The filet was a fine cut of meat and perfectly done, served with three sauces, the best of which was the chimichurri. The salmon was a huge chunk with a great sear, and the snapper was perfectly done but maybe lacked something in flavor.  Prices are high -- this is a resort restaurant -- but not outrageous.  I'm pretty picky, but I really can't find anything wrong with Toro Latin.  But I'll be back to keep trying.  PostNote: Came back in February 2016.  Still can't find anything wrong.  Ribs also very good.  One small point - you can make reservations for sitting outside but they may not honor it when you get there, such as if a large party calls and takes the entire area.

BOTTOM LINE: Sol Caribe is a new restaurant.  It is a find and I suggest you give it a try.  Help it get started, and treat yourself before it is so busy you will have to wait for a table.  Understand that Sol Caribe is a neighborhood ethnic restaurant, and I have rated it as such.  Here's how a smallish plain-looking cafe with simple food rates five stars in my book:  1.  It is very clean, bright, and comfortable despite the plastic chairs. 2.  The service is friendly and highly competent (our server knew the ingredients of every menu item), possibly because Sol Caribe is basically a husband-and-wife enterprise. 3.  The menu, classic Puerto Rican, has quite a number of interesting choices. 4.  The food, although simply-prepared, is also universally well-prepared, and this is the biggest factor for this type of restaurant -- "can the cook cook?".  5.  Prices were consistent with the type of restaurant (less than $10 for entrees), with appetizers and sides on the inexpensive side ($2-$3).   Specifics on the food: The appetisers consist of a half-dozen choices.  The ones our party tried were all top notch, including empanadas and a meat-filled cigar wrapped in a mixture containing plantain.  (Plantain appears in many dishes but it doesn't get boring because the preparations are so different).  The main courses were interesting and tasty.  The signature mofongo is a mound of plantain again, mixed with garlic and oil, and very tasty.  It comes either plain or with your choice of chicken, pork, or shrimp on the side.  For us, the small bytes of fried chicken were tasty and moist.  The roast pork was plain and looked dry but was actually very tasty.  It would still benefit from a sauce, such as a mojo.  The only miss of the night was the steak and onions, a classic dish which suffered because the meat itself was tough.  Each main course comes with a side, each of which was stellar.  We liked the plantains, both fried and sweet, and the rice with pigeon peas.  We had room for only one dessert between the four of us - a tres leches cake that was topped with coconut and shouldn't have been.  It was ok but by then we were not really interested in any more food.  Hint:  Sol Caribe is not really hard to find.  From McDowell, turn north on Granite Reef (which is 1/2 mile west of Rt. 101), and the restaurant is 1/2 block up on the right.

This review covers lunch at one location (Tempe) and dinner at another (Scottsdale). The experiences were similar.  We didn't try the ice cream.  As far as meals are concerned, it is tempting to call Culver's a fast food hamburger joint, similar to McDonald's, Wendy's, etc.  In general, this is a fair comparison because Culver's menu (posted on a screen above the cashiers), burger offerings, non-burger offerings, sides, etc. are very much the same as you would find in any such establishment.  But there are many differences in detail.  At Culver's:      The seating is better and partly separate from the serving area.      They bring the food to your table.      The burgers are bigger, less compacted, and tastier.      Everything is freshly cooked and hot.      When they put an extra on a sandwich, like mushrooms or onions, they use a lot of it.      It is just slightly more expensive (better value).  If you don't really care for hamburger joints, try Culver's.  But be careful not to burn your mouth on the hot food (no kidding).

We ate lunch at Lago on Saturday, and then returned for dinner on Monday -- so that says something.  Both experiences were much the same.  It is a joy to eat at Lago, with stunning views of the fountains, and a clean, open, modern decor which emphasises shapes and spaces.  If only the food were exceptional instead of competent (for the most part).  The basic concept at Lago is small plates, but they are really not so small, and two of them will satisfy the average appetite, with maybe a bit of room for one of their truly yummy desserts.  In fact, a Lago small plate is what restaurants used to call "a meal" before the ridiculous size expansion of the last ten years.  If you are not hungry, two per person may be too much.  All of the nine dishes we ordered were good, and we cleaned eight of our plates.  Only the pasta was left unfinished, and this because it gets very starchy when it cools.  But there is not one of them I can recommend as being exceptional but for the Bronzino, where the accompanying relish superbly compliments the fish.  Like all Bellagio restaurants, Lago is expensive, but not ridiculously so (except for wine), so you can probably afford it if you don't have a really bad day at the tables.  Bon appetite.

Five stars doesn't mean perfect, and Carvalho's is not, but it does mean that Scottsdale now has a new interesting dining experience that I can recommend to everyone.  Once.  Whether you will want to come back time after time depends on how much you like Brazilian food and whether the limited menu has enough variety for you.  The restaurant is very attractive, especially the outdoor seating towards the back (they also have a few tables in front near the parking lot), which is isolated from roadways and borders on a small pond with a fountain.  These may be some of the best tables in Scottsdale and almost worth a visit on their own in nice weather.  But there's more to like here.  The food is really Brazilian, although you will find some other Latin American influences present as well.  As far as I can tell, everything is not only fresh but freshly made, and that makes a big difference.  Plantain chips, which are served when you are seated, get stale easily, but these were fresh, and fried and salted perfectly.  Our fried yucca and coxinha de frango (chicken fritters) were also impeccably prepared, fresh, and crisp.    The Feijoada, a traditional black bean stew with sausage and smoked meats was tasty but in this case it was the presentation that wowed - the stew was served in a bowl, the rice in another, two small cups contained a pico de gallo and toasted ground yucca, and a plate had shredded collard greens and orange slices.  Color, shape, and a dynamically fresh appearance made this dish a visual delight.  You put the ingredients together yourself in another plate.  All for $16.  Another entree, the Picanha na Grelhada, was a plain steak with a slice of grilled pineapple - well prepared but rather mundane.  We tried a dessert, Bolo Prestigio, a chocolate layer cake filled with what I believe is a reduced condensed milk-coconut pudding.  It was just too sweet after we had filled ourselves on everything else.  The service speed was fine, but our waiter was new - not just to the restaurant but to being a waiter.  Although nice, he made mistakes such as taking our forks and knives when removing the appetizers and not replacing them, then disappearing for ten minutes..  You may have to put up with that here.  I would consider Carvalho's a dining experience and not overpriced.  Our two appetizers, two entrees, one dessert, and a drink cost me $80 including tax and tip.  If you are at all adventurous in dining or want a romantic evening, you really need to try Carvalho's.

Twisted Root is basically a brew pub without the brewery, meaning that instead of making their own beer they serve other people's micro brews.  Other than that is has the ambiance of a brew pub, the TV screens everywhere, and, unfortunately, the noise.  The food is good enough for that fifth star.  We tried the grouper sandwich (best fried fish sandwich I can remember) and an eggplant and burrata sandwich (almost as good).  The flatbreads are also special.  The fries were good but not great, but the other side dish - cauliflower grits - was special.  I'll be back - the menu is much better than most brew pubs and there are lots of things I want to try.  HINTS: 1.  It can be pretty crowded so get reservations if they will take them (not sure). 2.  Skip the monkey bread. 3.  If you don't like noise, see if you can get a more out-of-the-way table.

I'm not going to spend much time on this review because the problem was simple - the food was not even average for breakfast fare.  We had a couple of the hashes -- corned beef, and brisket with corn bread.  Both consisted of an inconvenient skillet with simple hash potatoes on the bottom.  This was topped with the meat, followed by our eggs.  There was little flavor in the potatoes (except grease), and our scrambled eggs were very overcooked and dry.  Worst were the meats.  These are not chopped into the hash but rather served on top of the potatoes.  The corned beef had a strange flavor that I find hard to describe.  The brisket was very thickly cut, extremely dry, and virtually tasteless (no smoke flavor at all).  On the good side, the biscuit and jam were good.

Possibly the best food in Las Vegas, although my review is based on only one visit.  Harvest is a new restaurant in the Bellagio Hotel.  Its look is modern, with a huge visible glassed-in kitchen, and seating that is comfortable and uncrowded.  The service is perfect.  There are a few cute touches such as the "snack cart" from which you can order $8 small to very small plates of off menu items while you are waiting for your first course, and a similar dessert cart.    The reason for the five stars, however, is the food.  We split an item from the snack cart (filet mignon satay), an appetizer salad, and had two main courses plus a side dish and all were superb.  The portions were so large we had no room for dessert.  Since the quasi-American menu is not very extensive, it is important that everything be delicious, because you might find yourself going out of your comfort zone when you order.  Not to worry - if your experience is like mine, you will enjoy whatever you pick.  Prices are high by outside world standards, but not bad at all for top-line resort eateries.  Our check, without alcohol, was about $100.  Hint:  Make your reservation at least a week ahead.

If I weren't a senior, I probably would knock off a star or two because the movie that costs me $8 is $14 for younger folks.  And that is just too much for the extras you get here.    The big plus at this ultra-modern theater is the seating.  Wide, comfortable, huge amounts of leg room, reclining.  You can really enjoy the movie and never have to have people's heads in your line of sight.  Of course it is new and clean.  But the decor is austere rather than warm and inviting - old time venues often have a special vibe that adds to the overall experience, but here it feels like  you are in the space terminal of the movie 2001.  The popcorn is popcorn, the sodas are sodas, and the rest of the food -- who cares, I didn't come here for a meal.  But all this really doesn't matter.  I come for the movie, and I like the seats, the screen, and the sound.  For $8, this is as good as it gets.
