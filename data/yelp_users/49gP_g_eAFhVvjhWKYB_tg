Love the charm of the place. I only wish they had a burger that did not taste as if it were boiled. And yes, I tried this place a couple times wanting to like it.

Never mind what I have to say...my Kid loves this place! Whether swinging by to hit balls in the cages or for baseball camp my youngest thinks this place ROCKS! Oh, in the summer, this is the coolest place in town. AC and batting cages are a blessing during 110 degree days. The staff is always helpful, they treat the kids well even while maintaining a little baseball tradition of goofing on ya a bit. It's perfect for both boys and young ladies. Great skill and confidence building. We'll be signing up for some private coaching this year. Hopefully with Coach Dude" or Coach "Redbeard"

Wow, why did I not take the 2 seconds and read the reviews. Ordered a horchata and a shredded beef taco. The drink was mediocre. The taco was a joke. It seriously had about a tablespoons worth of meat, maybe less. Now the place is very clean and the lady taking my order was very pleasant.

I'm hungry and surrounded by some of the best spots in Chandler to eat. But I'm short on time and see this kinda funky Pizza Joint. How bad can it be...? Clue one - place is empty, clue two - the guy pulls everything out of the fridge to make 2 pizza slices?? Hmmm not selling enough to keep under a warmer. Getting nervous...It was about 3:15PM so.. maybe I'm just being silly..I ordered one cheese and one pepperoni, 6 minutes later, I was provided 2 pepperoni slices. Ummmm.."I ordered....." pretty much got a shrug...okay then. Being short on time, I'll just slam these suckers down and be on my way. Yeah, I'm a food snob, but I also have a "just eat to eat rule" but that did not even work. I could not finish these things, I only ate as much as I did out of curiosity, trying to see if I ever had pizza this bad..frozen, kid place or mall.... Nope, this is by far the worst pizza ever. All it would have taking was 20 seconds to check the YELP Rating. I have no clue where these 3 and 4 star ratings are coming from...

You have to search for this place a little, but the prize is worth it. Let me start by saying I have a big appetite and San Francisco restaurants in my blood. I started with the Soujouk an Armenian sausage saut√©ed with sliced fresh tomatoes and onions. It had such bold flavor and balance I just had to try their baba ganoush. The harmony of tahini and faint citrus cooled my soul on this warm day. If I had to critique something, it might be slightly on the thin side but I know some like it this way. Zeez Grill has an open, casual industrial feel with friendly staff. Give um a try. I cannot wait to go back.  Oh Yeah Baklava - perfect! not overly sweet.  "Call me anything you want but late for dinner"  Update: Ownership has changed since my review.

If all the restaurants in the area are closed and your super hungry, this is the place for you. The food is relatively inexpensive but the quality also reflects it. The selection of the sushi on the carousel belt is very low. The food from the kitchen is also not much to talk about. I believe these people stay afloat because they're across the street from the Crowne Plaza San Marcos Resort and unknowing visitors from out-of-state are trying them. The others are locals that are coming from other nearby businesses where the line is too long and "we" forget to check yelp! You know the old "I could of had a V-8" ad where the person bonks their head, Yup "I should checked YELP" BONK! They get bumped to two stars for the nice server we had and that the food was $$. CHEERS!

OMG! I thought this place was going to be amazing. But it actually exceeded my expectations. Chef Justin's food is going to blow your mind. Met him tonight and he seems like family already. We had the Oxtail lumpia (the meat tender and with a perfectly crisp wrap,) Ahi Tuna dish that will rock your pallet, also had the risotto with chicken and finished the meal with  my first ever WORT milkshake. Talk about malty goodness. Presentation of all items were perfect! Hello.. 1 star reviews - it was the opening of a brewery/restaurant , of course it's going to be crowded. And for the record, this is a large place with ample parking. Far better than some of the other fine establishments mentioned. The kitchen staff was in concert with each other like a perfect sonnet when we arrived. They were happy, pleasant and responsive. No doubt due to the leadership of their Chef.  Beer was outstanding, weakest in MHO was the Pale, but still a solid beer. The ESB and Hefeweizen were spot on. This is very rare for first batches from any new brewery. I did not have the fries, but will check them out TOMORROW! My only criticism was lighting might be a little bright, but not distracting. And if that's the only suggestion this very detailed project manager has, this place should get 6 stars whether it was opening night or 6 months from now. And...personally if wrote an email, BASHING or congratulating a new establishment on opening week, I would not expect an email within 24 HOURS. Good Grief.

The Traveling Monk is one of the newest Food Trucks in the Valley. This truck came out swinging with some amazing beer inspired food. The crew working the Traveling Monk truck is friendly and gets the food out with a smile. The dude on the truck is pretty knowledgeable about beer too. I've sampled their food several times, most recently at the World of Beer 1 year anniversary party. The food is outstanding and seems to rotate a bit. I've tried their street tacos, burgers, bbq pork sliders, meatball sliders, portobello pesto ciabatta, green chilli pork and a few other items. The side items are crazy off-the-hook good too!! Did I mention the food is craft beer inspired? If you are looking for food bursting with flavor this is your truck. Did I tell ya they cook with craft beer?

So far so good. Tomorrow is the grand opening. The tap list is awesome and the decor is very comfortable. Fair amount of parking. Awesome freeway access off the I-10 and Elliot Rd. I will update when their beers are brewing.

I've been waiting for this place to open for a while now. It seems many others were too, with over 3000 likes on Facebook before their soft opening. Okay, number one important item for a brewery is the BEER. Day one started with three very tasty beers (American Red Ale, Estrella Pale Ale and an amazing session beer @ 3.7% ABV,) on day two, they added an excellent IPA. Yup, this place is so good I went their two days in a row. And yeah, I said an excellent session @ 3.7%. How they got this much flavor at this AVB, I've no clue. So BEERs = 4.9 stars, and this is only the first batch. Not sure what to expect when they really get to know their brew system. 4.9 was only because their were no guest taps and with the limited handles they have, they may never add (I don't know, gonna have to ask) But their beers are so good, I almost don't care.  Next for me is cleanliness, this place is spotless, granted it is new, Boom 5.0 Stars. Service, oh so many people fail here, not these guys. Plenty of staff on hand to deal with the crowds 4.8 stars. Decor, this place is ultra comfortable. I honestly thought with 3 bearded outdoorsmen opening a brewery it was going to look like the moose lodge or the Bass Pro Shop, but no... elegant pictures surround you as you enjoy your beer in comfortable seating with soft lighting showcasing the gorgeous wilderness landscape photos. The colors scheme complements every aspect of the place and is easy on the eyes. A variety of seating arrangements and selection are available for patrons to enjoy. Ambience 5 stars and bonus .5 stars.  The food does not start until their grand opening on Sept 2nd ,2013, and they already have many things staged including the menu and condiment baskets waiting to be filled. I'll update my review during the first week in Sept. CHEERS!

While serving on a local nonprofit board raising money for brain cancer research,  I found Post Box eXpress via a web search, at the time I didn't know anyone that had utilized their services. We were a small nonprofit and needed a PO Box and fulfillment vendor for our merchandise orders since we didn't have any staff. Post Box eXpress was able to fill those needs and more.  They are able to store, pack and ship just about anything,  prices are extremely fair and they have a variety of ways to handle your inventory. We inspected their building both front and back of house, interviewed staff and checked security. Ha, yeah all that for simple swag. LOL The board decided to utilize Post Box eXpress.  A few weeks after the decision was made, I found that one of our volunteers knew one of the owners outside of the business and had nothing but glowing remarks for the owner. What do I mean by "FAIR prices?" Well - they pass their bulk savings to you, the customer.  Not jack the price up 20-30% like some many others. You'll actually pay less than if you had your own small business shipping account.  Skip forward a couple years and I'm starting a business and did not hesitate to call on Post Box eXpress. And guess what... they happen to be located about 25 miles from my home and office. But the service is so good and staff super-awesome - it did not matter. Oh, I guess I should mention that both Phoenix Ale and Sonoran Brewing happen to be right across the street. :)  So, if you're looking for friendly mail service with excellent pricing, convenient to downtown and the airport, and not too far from freeway access with excellent proximity to great beer. This is your Shipping, Fulfillment and PO Box Service Provider!

Just opened. Very clean, mix of booth style seating and some chairs. Menu is extensive with a mix of Japanese and Chinese foods. I tried the Gyoza which is the deep fried style not pan-fried and steamed. Nice dipping sauce. House fried rice was tasty and not over oily. Took a big chance and tried their yellowtail (hamachi) sushi and it was pretty good and made to order. The place has somewhat of a fast food Asian feel but with some nice touches. Food is cooked to order. No beer but I will certainly return. CHEERS!

Downtown destination. Carnivore? You must get the Phx French dip or the amazing Roosevelt Reuben, yeah duck pastrami baby. Melt in your mouth amazement. Have a date that enjoys a vegetarian meal. Well you're covered with an amazing sweet potato & black bean burger. The beer list is fantastic although they are not brewing yet. Most of the system is in and hopefully we'll get a taste of Mother Bunch Beer soon. Parking is a little tight so do the urban thing , and walk, bike, hike or bus it in. Decor is very comfortable and welcoming.
