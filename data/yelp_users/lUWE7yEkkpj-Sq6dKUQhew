One of downtowns biggest gems. The skinny  I travel at least 2-3 times a year for different events car shows, comic con etc... This place is great for all of these events. The a/c is always at a perfect temperature and I can't say enough about the beautiful architecture that alone deserves a visit.  The bad  While the food selection is great it is not cheap and charge ball park prices (4-5$ bottles of water) which makes me just bring my own stuff. The security guards seem to have a funny attitude towards me sometimes maybe it's cause I look intimidating with my smiles and how are you's but they (not all of them but most) don't answer and just check my credentials.  I don't let them get me down but a simple hello from another human being is usually real nice.  Overall this place is great and if you have and event here you should be so lucky and enjoy get a map and don't get lost.

By far the worst gay nightclub in phoenix and trust me I know gay nightclubs!!!  Lol no seriously this place is crap I have been suckered to come here a few times for a birthday party and some other events and it's no fun the drag show is lame or the acts I have seen are the Dj is good plays some different tunes the a/c is non existent I think they use a swamp cooler. The bathroom is the size of a toilet stall and always packed that u have to piss in the alley where there is plenty of hookers at your disposal. The drinks are expensive, watered down and even the soda tasted funny the bar tender was very nice and friendly. Never tried the food outside but I hear it's great, the parking is another disaster there is limited space and the night we went there was a few break ins in the back parking lot near liquor store. Just being honest but the bad outweighs the good at this club, give it a shot at your own risk but remember I warned you.

Let me tell you about my little friend the bruschetta. The skinny  I can't comment enough about the bruschetta it's a little slice of heaven. Not to gas you up so much I am not a big fan of bruschetta so I never order it, on a date night with my gf she ordered it and to my surprise they brought a good helping more than my gf could handle and wow! The bread was nice a toasted with a garlic cheese butter and they add fresh cold chopped tomato with fresh cut basil with a little olive oil. The pizza is great sauce taste as it should and they don't use the generic cheeses and ingredients, plus they always have great specials online and on social media. The wings are also great big and tasty with lots of sauce which I find it comparable to long wongs med sauce.  The bad Pretty common thing for me with parking but this is particularly a bad area to park and not the greatest of areas especially at night have seen some seedy people.  Overall this place is a Phoenix staple and great for dates I would recommend it.

The customer service at this michaels is just plain horrible. The bad Me and my girl frequent michaels, she for her crochet needs and me for my shoe paints. I never really ask for help unless I am completely lost I'm usually ok with getting lost. The times I have asked I have not been met with kind responses but I just let it roll off my back, this last time was different me and my gf received and email coupon for 50% off for Halloween promo my girl needed more yarn so we decided to both go and I would use my coupon for an extra yarn for her. After we were done shopping and ready to pay I noticed everyone was using a coupon the gentleman who was working cash register seemed very nice to other customers as soon as I came up and asked him how he was his mood changed he did not answer my question and asked if that was all I said yes sir and I showed him my coupon he said oh another one, I just laughed it off like ok. After I finished and he was giving me my yarn in no bag I said thank you again he ignored me, I snapped I said your welcome that's what u say after someone thanks you or at least acknowledge me! I know I scared him as he started nervously laughing and saying sorry I just walked out shaking my head. I won't go back to this Michaels and I won't shop without a coupon again. I did call and leave bad review on both of our receipts and I think I am going to call the manager as well real lame customer service should always be called out.

I have given this place so many chances and now I am done with this location and maybe Waffle House in general.  The skinny  By no means do I expect Waffle House to be a 5 star restaurant but what I do expect is a clean and friendly place and this place never gets it right I have been there 6 times (no car closest food chain)  as I work around the corner. Out of those 6x only once did I see a worker that I had seen before this place seems to have a high turnover rate. They made a few mistakes such as giving me the wrong burger (I order the lunch special 5$ double burger with drink combo) they tried to charge me for wrong burger and I had to tell them that I ordered special which I always say can I have the 5$ burger special to avoid confusion after a brief argument she gave me the special price. The food is ok I don't expect it to be great but it's not bad. The very last time I went there, there was 2 employees one cool one waitress they seemed to be texting and getting calls from friends on the work line as it kept going off and they would have small quiet conversations with. When I ordered the special the cook seemed to be upset over me disrupting his convo he finished my burger literally in 2 minutes he gave me a small plate with just burger no hash browns and my drink. He asked how my burger tasted I advised it seemed under cooked and not that great which he laughed and walked away I didn't finish burger. When I went up to pay she charged me for the special I let her know I did order the special and that  I didn't get my hash browns she deducted .60c when I asked if that's how much hash browns cost she replied rudely and barked yes I paid with no tip and as I was leaving could hear her complain about it I let them know how I felt and how unprofessional they were and left. The cook was also cursing out loud as he thought I would be cool enough to not say anything.  Even if I was starving and had a free lunch coupon would I ever go back to this place.

Management and new release policies aren't working out. The skinny/bad  I have been coming to this specific footlocker since it became a house of hoops location (they get more limited edition shoes than other general FL stores)and even before then and have been pleased with the way I was treated until recently. The last few years they have changed staff and policy I don't recognize the store anymore it used to be first come first serve for new releases and now it's a raffle based system. So basically if you have a homie that works there he can guarantee you a pair without having to come in like everyone else does to fill out raffle ticket. There is no regulation and the manager will hook up star athletes and celebrities to make new friends than keep it fair by selling to a loyal customer. Another policy is that if you buy a new release and release date you can't return it, I was shocked as they stayed that I was reselling shoes and mad cause I couldn't sell the pair I had bought when in all honesty I bought the pair cause I liked color didn't try on fit too tight but since all shoes were sold out they let me know I could not return, it took me calling corporate office to report issue where they sent me box to mail direct to them and then 10-14 days later I got my money back horrible experience.  Overall  I still shop here I still go for the sales but with so much competition in this mall I generally go to other stores first and save this for last I'd recommend you do the same sheik shoes and finish line had great sales this past weekend.

Great atmosphere, staff and food. The skinny  I am not much of a big Thai food guy but every now and then I get a taste for the peanut chicken from here and drive all the way from the west valley. The price is not great but it is affordable I also just saw a 20% off with check in on yelp awesome. I have had a few drinks rum and coke great mix more liquor than soda which I appreciate. The staff is awesome I usually speak with Kris and the team and they always make my visit great and my check out quick as I'm always in a hurry damn meters :-). I have met the owner Diedra a few times and she is an absolute delight she makes u feel welcome like you have been coming here for years. I can't compliment this place enough for the staff and food I think I will have the tamarind chicken here very soon.  The bad  Nothing. The parking in Scottsdale is a joke on weekends but if your from here you know that already.  Overall This place deserves a visit especially with the check in special. The staff and good will sell you I'm sure of this.

Munchies and much more. The skinny  This place is as legendary spot in az as zia records is/was not known by all but known by many. I can't count how many free pinner cards I filled up not the many times I visited this joint (pun intended) my order/good old trustee is the white widow with Jamaican jerk chicken instead of reg chicken thy refer to it as the Jamaican widow not on menu but they will surely know what you are talking about I get the blunt size (12') a little pricey under 10$ a little over that if you want a drink but they do have kool aid :-). The snacks are phenomenal they have capt krunch bars (think nuclearRice Krispie treats) great for the quality and freshness I'm almost positive they make them daily. They also have beer and liquor now which changes the whole place up to me I might catch a game or 2 this year at the bar. They also deliver and are very quick as today co workers got delivery.  The bad  The price seems to keep floating up and the specials aren't so special anymore step it up Cheba!!  Overall  A must visit if you have the munchies and big wallet :-)

If all vegetarian food tasted like this I would stop being a carnivore. The skinny  After missing out on a movie premier and having some time for a date with my significant other who happens to be a pescaterian we decided to try green as she has been dying to try the big wac. We called in our order and decided to pick up order took less than 10 min in and out great :-). The burger was great I could see why it's a big hit and the French fries are awesome I ate the whole batch. What really made my day was the organic sweet lime drink omg it was not too sweet and not too bland but just perfect mix almost like what u would like ur lemonade to come out like. The price was a lil high for me $11.50 for the meal but I think it was worth it. I was beyond full. The bad  I asked the cashier if it was possible to try the tea with a sample cup she said yes and gave me a big cup and charged me for it even though I asked just to sample maybe I didn't say it loud enough, and she charged me for it without first confirming that the price went up it ended up being ok as I liked the drinks they had. So no big deal. Overall This place is a must for anyone looking to improve eating habits or wanna try something diff for a change I will be coming back soon.

This was my go to spot, but customer service has gone down for me.  The skinny  With so many pizza places I would think one would try to stand out by focusing in on product and customer service. I recently called in an order and I just didn't feel that warm reception I was so used to maybe it's new staff maybe they are just tired either way I understand. While I don't expect to be treated like a king I also don't want to hear a sigh when I ask what the special of the day is. I ordered my pizza and wings for pick up and I head that way check in on yelp and find out they have a 2 liter special, though I didn't qualify for it as I didn't order a 16-18' pizza but I saved it for next time, although the low carb pizza does not come that big I will have to figure something else out. Wings are great not as saucy as I like them as I usually dip my pizza in the sauce. The pizza I ordered 12' veggie with cheese low carb option they are usually on point but for some reason it tasted very salty like they over seasoned the veggies not so enjoyable.  The bad  The area can get crowded and the parking lot attendant will give you a dirty look to make sure you aren't using the lot for the Vig parking. Overall I will be back if I have coupon but with the customer service here I don't think this will be my go to place anymore.

You ever get so excited to visit a eatery, and it ends up just being ok... The skinny  My girlfriend and her Hawaii'n crew decided to meet up for a triple date about a week ago I have been anticipating this trip so much, I have been researching the menu and drinks. I originally wanted to go with Mac and cheese as I keep reading reviews but I was very hungry and love al pastor so I decided on the pastor street tacos (10$) and the Harlem shake (9$) our waitress was amazing she was always there when the table needed something. The Harlem shake was great but I didn't realize it came in a martini glass so I got laughed at by my group for having such a sex and the city drink lol. To me the best part of the meal was the banana bread pudding dessert (7$) the soft warm gooey taste of fresh banana bread pudding with a scoop of delicious vanilla ice cream everyone in my table enjoyed it. The bad  Parking is horrible I ended up parking near a church and trekked my way over no big deal. The pastor tacos, for a lack of a better word was a huge let down not only did they look smaller than the appetizers, the al pastor was burnt and tasted like steak not like it had been marinating for days tortillas were a bit cold so made them taste different than they should. I was finished with my meal and still very hungry :-( I ended up trying a few other things from my tables order but felt bad.  Overall  I will be back to check out happy hour but for my money and appetite I will be going elsewhere for dinner. Great service staff.

If your looking for great Chinese food for cheap and in a hurry this place will kick Panda Express's ass.  The skinny I found this place about 8-9 years ago and have been a fan this place since, it has the best orange chicken and honey walnut shrimp I have ever had. Now I have never actually sat and ate here but I always take my order to go or delivery which is insane how far they go. The orange chicken has plenty of sauce but the chicken is always crispy if you get the combo plate they will add 2 crab puffs egg roll and rice and noodles which are also to die for if you go after 5pm and spend 15$+ they will throw in free crab puffs with coupon and coupon is in menu so just pick one up. The girls are always sweet in front area and are always so quick.  The bad  Once the delivery driver was pretty aggressive with the tip he made sure to let me know twice where the tip line was on my check even after I told him I had cash for tip. Another time they got my order wrong and did not give me combo plate but manager made it up by offering free crab puffs next time which I didn't take advantage of as I always use that coupon but even then I wasn't too bummed out this place rocks. They also have gone on month long vacations and have closed for that long which drove us insane lol. Overall this place is one of my favorite spots and they maybe yours too if you give them a shot.

I fell in love with jollibees on one of my trips to Hawaii I found out that they are as popular in the Philippines as McDonald's is to America.  The good/skinny I have to say the burgers taste very different than what I am used to but man if you have an open mind you should def try it (I think) they make there burger meat using there world famous gravy (I go for the big aloha cause it has a pineapple in it) they also use a honey mustard for the sauce and the taste combo is amazing. The chicken is always perfect and taste fresh with a side of banana ketchup (has no taste of banana and is so tasty) the French fries are so good as well always taste fresh and perfect a must if you are in Las Vegas.  The bad  They don't offer the aloha hot dog which I loved in Hawaii I always ask just to make sure they know they should get it in. And sometimes it can take a while for food to come out but with all good food it takes time so I'm patient :-). This place is def worth it if your foodie like me and try the ketchup you only live once.

I'm one of the biggest fans of the fair but will point out why people aren't showing up anymore.  The good  I love the concerts but one thing is certain death, taxes and either sublime, weezer and or snoop will be performing at the fair now I love these bands it would be great to get some more diversity in the concerts. The food although overpriced I have a few favorites like the garlic fries from cardinallis pizza and deep fried pb and j and funnel cakes! The rides are ok not a big thrill fan so I enjoy the exhibits art and photography contest are great and u can help judge. They are allowing outside good and drinks so save money and brin your own food. I also like they have better cleaner food trucks some seem to be a bit more affordable. The bad The prices and prizes are really not worth the squeeze, I take advantage of the special discount days they have so I can save money. 10$ admission fee they are nuts for charging so much per person I know they have a special this year where they give u 10$ credit when u pay 10$ for admission on your next trip nice way to get people to come back but that won't work what will would be to make it more affordable and step up the food quality. Overall  I have the season pass and don't regret it I will see most concerts and I avoid paying for parking by finding street parking near grand about a block walk but it's worth saving money can't wait to see weezer and queens of the Stone Age :-)

A few months ago I was passing by this park and witnessed as former president Bill Clinton clearing out some weeds and planting corn.  The skinny  As a downtowner this park has always been our hidden gem from the annual 4th of July celebration to the pride festival this place is great. The park is well maintained and clean with lots of trash containers and recycling all over. Great for a nice bike ride or to feed the ducks (my daughters fav thing to do) they have a few different birds and diff color ducks which makes it fun to see the difference between them. They also have a pond for fishing, we do see a few people out there fishing.  The bad  There is quite a bit of homeless people at this park and they can make it not so fun with the arguing or yelling at each other or at us for some change. While the park itself is very lit up the parking lot is scary dark, I would not let my gf and daughter go there solo at night.  Overall This park is great can't wait for the cool evening coming up so I can take some walks here.

This review is coming from someone who does not enjoy breakfast.  The skinny  My girlfriend found a great deal in living social for 10$ you would get 40$ credit but only in 10$ increments great deal for a great place. We decided to go on a Tuesday hoping it would not be too busy it was not they had plenty of seats and people kept coming in. I ordered the chicken fries steak with 2 eggs and hash browns the dish looked picture perfect with plenty of food not bad for 10$ the eggs were perfect and the hash browns are to die for the seasoning they use is amazing, the chicken fried steak was a bit salty to me but some hot sauce helped it out :-) my gf ordered a veggie breakfast sandwich and hash browns and she was very pleased. We sat at bar an asked for separate checks and we used 2 of the coupons we had both out meals came out to under 10$ with tip which was great the waitress didn't seem to thrilled for our savings, lol.  Overall this place is great and affordable the food is good and the parking is easy. I had to dodge a few kids while walking to car so please slow down while here :-).

Super L has some ridiculous pricing. The skinny Anytime I need something quick I usually travel here by foot as I feel it a waste of gas to travel half a mile while convenient this place has some outrages pricing. I don't normally get my regular shopping items here but I found myself in a pickle when I had some friends over and needed some chips and dip I walk over to my friendly super L to my surprise it's 4$ for a med bag of Doritos and dip was close to 7$ and had about half an inch of dust on it. Am I at a bodega? Am I at circle k? God no even they would tax you on chips this crazy. I chose not to buy anything, I go in today thinking what's the worse they can charge for a 2 liter I go to coke section and was shocked to see a special sign next to them where the cost was 2 for 5$ wow again I walk out now I'm just going to avoid this place unless I need something specific I can't find anywhere else IE shrimp chips. I'm sure I'm paying double what the cost is for them but I can't find them anywhere so oh well.

Good pick up at a great store. The skinny I have heard of this place for over 2 years before I decided to take the trip over, I was upset with myself as I should have been going here since the beginning. They had a great sale for the holiday weekend was able to get a few tees and a pair of roshe runs for 20% off as I donated a toy for their Christmas toy drive (awesome!!) they also have jason markk shoe cleaner which I use all the time for cheaper than amazon.com the staff was great minus one person (Asian dude) he seems like he hates my guts when I ask anything, so I just avoid him at all cost. I will continue to support this store as they are the last true first come first served shoe release store in Phoenix. They also take phone orders on release day for whatever is left I have gotten lucky a few times on some pretty exclusive shoes.  If your in the area and love shoes give them a try and support a local store.

Don't pay for one wash when you can get the monthly pass for almost the same price duh. The skinny  I see a lot of complaints about the car not being clean enough and what not my suggestion is to get the monthly pass which is equal to the high end was about 12-20$ monthly depending on what time of month it is they prorate the first month and you can wash your vehicle as many times as you please and be able to use the vacuum and air hoses. If I see my car not as clean as I like, I just go through it again I wash my car at least 3 times a week if not more. But then again I care about my car (Peter the Prius) he's white so I like him clean. The staff is always great and friendly I miss the hawaiin lady who worked at the 44th st location she moved to a new place and her husband (7th ave location) is also great I tend to go to both spots. They alone make this place a 5 star place always nice and helpful (they will spray hard to remove spots and other things just ask) they provide a cleaning towel with a 8$ wash or package which helps but I have my own and with the most expensive package they provide a fragrance card (wild cherry,new car smell)  The bad  On weekends and after rainy days you will see lines for days but plan ahead, I do. Also a few times I have been either stuck or nothing was working or spraying soap and I had to go back to the line which sucks but it happens not too bummed about it as it only happened 3 times.  Overall even with the section that's bad this place deserves 5stars I am a happy member and look forward to the new improvements that are coming.

If your looking for authentic Mexican aguas and tortas this is the place for you. The skinny  I have been coming here for about a year now and they have kept up with the quality waters I have tried the horchata melon limon naranja and piña. All are great my favorite is the agua de Fruta the large drink is 2.70 and is worth every drop ask for no ice and get more :-). The tortas are ok seems pretty average comparing them to other torta places or even filibertos the carne asada is on point and they have daily specials like a torta fries and drink for 5.99 plus tax. They also have a panederia (bakery) with fresh Mexican donuts and breads decent prices you might get same quality at ranch market for cheaper but it's great they offer it.  The bad  The front counter is so close to the door I sometimes get confused about the line and it makes for unnecessary confrontations between patrons. While I do speak Spanish I did hear a lady having the hardest time ordering in English until I stepped in to help no big deal but I think they could have handled situation better.  Overall  This place is as authentic as the places I go to Mexico especially the waters they are great cooks, quick and affordable

I used to be a regular here but moving away from downtown has moved me to a new watering hole but I do miss this place.  Food/drinks/happy hour/atmosphere  I usually order the Dr. funk or the Hawaii 50 (both 5$ during happy hour) which are both great options if you like a fruitier drink, I would ask the bartender to recommend something based on your taste as they are usually nice enough to let you try it. I have tried a lot of their menu and the pork tacos (happy hour 3$) are a big stand out to me they taste like a kalua pig mixed with some great spices with a fresh home made salsa that has some spice but not much which is great. They have a great happy hour from 3:30-6 mon-fri and all night weds great time to check this place out if you are curious. The place is real laid back I have been there in slacks and dress shirts to basketball shorts and a white tee.  The bad I have had an issue with one waiter a few times (3 to be exact)in one such event I came in during their freaky tiki event where they had a buy one get one free. I ordered 2 dr funks for me and my girl who was running a bit late, he let me know that he would bring me one drink at a time and that I couldn't have 2 drinks. I explained the situation to him and he just walked off without acknowledgement and came back with one drink. We had to wait a while for him to come back as it was busy, not a very good experience but now when I go in I avoid his section so no problem. The parking is also a concern especially during the weekend but I have heard they are working that issue out. Take a chance on this place you won't be disappointed even with a few hiccups this place deserves the 5 stars.

A love for good food and hip hop? This is the place to be.  Food/drinks/atmosphere I never was a fan of a BLT as I felt they weren't filling enough after trying the BLT here I completely regret never ordering them before the thickness and taste of the bacon mixed with fresh lettuce tomato and avocado with mildly spicy mayo deelish! They also add a nice green salad with a homemade balsamic dressing which the waitress was kind enough to pack me and extra one for home :-) I have had only a few drinks there don't remember the name but I know it was a lemonade which I drink a bit and one had me feeling great so the price wasn't that bad (around 8$) the atmosphere is best described with a business man head bobbing to wu tang clan.  The bad  Parking sometimes can be a headache but nothing u couldn't handle. And a few times it felt like they didn't have the ac on and had door open and fans on it was a hot 90+ degrees outside please just close door and let the fat people like me drink and not sweat lol.  Great place great food great music and great staff.

Got my car towed from my townhouse were my car is registered the reason "it looked like it was abandoned"  The skinny  Now I know I may not have the nicest car in the world but it's also not a POS car, I assume from the rain and dust my car was spotted and looked to be abandoned. But that's not the case at all since my car is registered to the complex and from me living here for over a year and never having issues with my car parked in that specific area. They claimed to have checked with office and they confirmed it was no one who lives in complex which was a blatant lie I asked for the name of contact so I can ask my front office but they don't have or are unwilling to give me info. I confirmed with my not so nice of a front office person which she confirmed they would not tow my car as I'm registered. I call and speak with a lady at this location which basically tells me there is nothing they can do and I need to pay 120$ to get my car back. I LOL'ed and asked they release my car she again stated I needed to pay I let her know per az law they can't legally hold my car as it has up to date tags insurance and it was not towed by request of law enforcement after she rolled her eyes she asked if I could sign a promise to pay notice I said no and signed a refusal to pay notice. They took there sweet time and about an hour later I got my car back and left I will be billed by the company and I will be reaching out for legal help. This company will not win my money without a fight that's for sure.  Overall I would never use this company as the whole ordeal has made me think they do this often and with no regulation over the practice they are free to do what they want I called police who let me know that they legally can do what they did and the only way to fight it is small claims court. Don't be intimidated by them when they say u have to pay u don't. You have rights You just have to speak up.

If your looking for a great hot dog this is a place to try.  The food/service/atmosphere I ordered the Sonoran and chihuahua hot dogs and both were so good the Sonoran has mayo ketchup guacamole a jalapeño relish with nacho cheese and ruffles queso chips on top, the other had bacon with cheese ketchup mayo jalapeño relish and onions. Both are amazing the staff was friendly but this place is not the fastest (great food takes time) my gf who is vegetarian ordered the plain nachos they had jalapeño nacho and Mexican powder cheese with a Mexican sour cream and beans they were awesome a little small but great. The place was small and had about 6 tables inside and shared 2 tables outside with pizza patron so we took it to go which I felt was a mistake as I wanted one more hot dog as they are a bit small.  The bad  They charge .50c to use debit or CC I hate it when companies do this. The price is a bit high for the amount of food, The staff although friendly seemed to have a hard time with English I always speak Spanish especially when it's a Latin establishment but I oils see this being an issue for my non Spanish speaking buddies. Parking lot is a mess and homeless stroll outside like the walking dead.  Still a great place to try and they have a few locations all in west phx on Indian school.

Great groupon deal 20$ for 40$ credit here. The skinny  After a nice walk around the mall me and my girl decided on Mexican food for lunch we quickly searched groupon for any deals and found papi chulos less than a mile away with a great deal. We got there the waitress super friendly sat us right away and a young gentleman served us chips and salsa and we had out drinks even before I could open menu what great service. We decided on our meals my girl the shrimp fajitas (16$) and me the arrachera (flank steak 15$) my girl was in love as she loves her veggies and she thought the shrimp was cooked just right. My plate was also great the steak was soft and cut just like butter and the marinate sauce was so good. We def got out money's worth I just wasn't to crazy about rice and beans.  The bad  Sticky tables and sticky menus clean that up for me please :-)  Overall  This place deserves the extra star for service but it is your typical Mexican joint but the arrechera seems to be there claim to fame prices are set a bit high but I do taste the freshness and quality.

A little gem right by my daughters school :-) The food/skinny I usually get the kalua pork plate no cabbage (#16) and it is good not great (comparing to Hawaii pork which I shouldn't) it is a lot better than L & L I will say the Mac salad is always on point cold and delicious. We just tried the garlic cheese fries for the first time and omg I wish we ordered the large and not the mini they were beyond delicious very garlicky and lots and lots of cheese. My girlfriend usually orders the shrimp burger and Mac salad and she loves it. I also love the fact that the menu is so big and has lots of options I always leave full, the girl that works the front is always very nice and sweet she never messes up our order.  The bad  The location is sometimes a bit of a drive they should open a few more places as this good is great.  This place is a gem and all the people who live or work in north Las Vegas should check this place out.

On a nice spring morning I took a trip to the downtown farmers market where I first saw short leash dogs and had my taste buds knocked upside down, now at first I was reluctant as looking at menu with the weird combos and even weirder names I decided to take a chance and will forever be thankful for that decision. The Igby my friends should have a street named after it I would kiss that dog if I met him they start with a delicious flat bread (pita-ish) with your choice of hot dog (spicy, regular or bratwurst) I go with brat they then layer with a fresh coleslaw they add BBQ sauce to it and then layer it with blue cheese I know what ur thinking but trust me it works. I also love the fact that they put a slice of a hot pickle on the top. And the dum dum for dessert is classic.

A little escape from the hustle and bussle of first Friday. The "yeah man" I really liked the fact they had a few bars and short lines during the crowded first Friday me and a friend got our drinks run and coke for me Malibu pineapple for her 12$ for both 2$ til cause I saw he hooked it up with liquor "my man!!" After a few a was feeling nice. We did see the menu but not hungry enough to eat will have to try another time. The bad Some of the music was beyond corny lol I was shocked that a place that was so busy was playing old boring music no one seemed to care but that was my sign to make the move to another bar :-). Overall I will be back when I'm there for first Fridays and or any event downtown I def wanna try the food and I hope they will play some better music next time, "DJ hit me!!" :-)

Why has dunkin done nothing about their customer service?  The skinny  I don't usually get coffee nor am I a big donut lover but my gf is so by default I frequent places like this. I never had a great experience here no one has ever wowed me which is ok I never expect it. The problem is they never seem to be average or ok with service I always seem to have one thing wrong with my order which is funny to me as usually order one thing med iced coffee with cream and 3 splendas (my gf's order) and they either give me no cream and 3 splendas or cream and 3 reg sugars. I never tell them I just fill out there survey in the back of receipt and let them know what's going on I'm sure I have left my share of bad remarks but nothing has changed, once the 99c coffee promo is up we will be going back to Starbucks although expensive, the baristas usually give u a smile and are friendlier (though not all).  So overall I gave this place 2 stars just based on their customer service I hope they can step that up as I'm not a difficult customer and I hate to be treated like I am.

Smells like teen spirit? No I say more like teen BO.  The skinny I have lived downtown most of my life and really wouldn't have it any other way I love the architecture and community for art downtown. I first heard about the first Friday events when I was working at the burton Barr library and was a fan of going out to support local artist. Most of the works that are in galleries or shops are too expensive but great to look at, most of the street art is crap and looks to be almost a joke or someone pretending to be an artist to make a quick buck. The funny thing to me is to always see some teen with a free hugs sign on or someone arguing for religion, animal rights and marijuana. Save your pamphlets as I recycle them, the vendors are not really reasonable about prices ur typical 3$ waters and over prices food trucks are always out there I paid 2$ for a sweet tea that I hope was tea and not just funny tasting water from a vendor called chillin b's. I honestly don't know how that dude makes money that was the worse tasting drink I ever had. There are some cool spots to buy some tshirt and other stuff which is cool but honestly everything is way overpriced here.  Wait till winter as the heat will make any event the worse.

Been thinking about saving some money and filling up your own water tanks? This is the place for you. The skinny  Been coming here for about a year now looks to be family owned which always makes me feel better. I usually come in afternoon time and on weekends I have never had to wait to fill up my tanks as they have plenty of space and or will try to work it out that everyone has a short wait. The gentleman in the front is always nice and has helped me with my water outside or comes to hold door which he doesn't have to (thanks my friend) he always lets me know what to try as far as ice cream or traditional Mexican snacks (tostilokos, escamochas etc) I finally gave in an tried the Sonoran dog which was excellent all fresh toppings as I saw him cut most of it in front of me as I was filling up water.  The bad  While this place deserves 5 stars I do find the music playing to be of a certain taste now I like hoe slapping drug dealing rap just as much as the next guy but I'm sure not everyone was amused by lil Wayne and his rapping about bitches loving him. I don't mind that music but I'm sure the older lady with her kid did, lol.  Even with that little hiccup this place rocks staff is always friendly an helpful and it saves you sweet mula on water.

If your on the hunt for some chicken but tired of KFC and church's chicken, this is the place for you. The good  I recently purchase a groupon for 11$ which gave me 2 10$ coupons to use here great deal. I ordered the 4 piece chicken tenders fries and sweet corn balls 8.99 plus tax I also ordered and extra biscuit .50c after my groupon my total came out to .21c great deal I get my order about 15 min later as they make it fresh. Man the taste is so unique seems like they season with a lot of pepper so so good. The fries are great but what really stands out is the sweet corn balls man those rungs are so good. The staff has always been nice although sometimes there is only one person there and I feel bad for him, but he is nice and always helpful. The bad  This place closes every now and then for weird reasons and some very understandable reasons like the ac being out one time they were closed cause they ran out of chicken.  Overall  This place is great especially after the groupon and other discounts you can find a def must try for chicken lovers.

For those missing Hawaii and have a sweet tooth, this is the place for you. The skinny  I placed an order a few weeks ago for my girlfriends birthday and she is always going on about guava cakes and rainbow cakes from back home. I found this plae after a quick yelp search and am supremely happy with the results. She made a custom guava cake, it was shaped like sushi rolls :-) one of best cakes I have ever had the guava was sweet but not overly sweet and the cake was soft and moist she added a few shots of lilikoi cups. I had issues with my car for pick up and she was sweet enough to deliver for a fee which was worth it for me. The cake was about 20$ and I would have paid more for quality.  The bad  Nothing she is amazing!!! Overall  If you are wanting to try something new for a change and or have to pick up a traditional cake she does amazing work and look for the yelp deals they usually have one.

This year for my significant others birthday she wanted a bundt cake I researched on yelp and came across this place less than 2 miles from my house and I thank my fellow yelpers for the great advice. The Skinny  I drove there after work about a week before my girlfriends birthday just to make sure I gave enough time for my order. The girl in the front helped me out and even let me sample some of the cakes I was confused on what to order and she let me know that I can order the small bundt cakes so she can try all the ones they had, SCORE!!! I paid for my order and they gave me my ticket and time it will be ready everything was perfect and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes when I went to pick up. Now for the good part each cake definitely had its very own distinct taste I absolutely loved the lemon and peanut butter cakes those 2 are the best all very moist and fluffy but very soft and rich in taste just perfect, I never was a bundt cake fan till now.  The bad When I first walked in I felt like the lady in front felt like she was getting robbed lol im a big guy and I guess I can look very intimidating and I assume they don't get many people that look like me in a cake store. But once I spoke up and let her know what I needed that feeling quickly passed. Overall  This place is great the staff is fast and friendly and will give you samples :-) the cakes are amazing and I will be using them again in the future and turn more people into bundt cake lovers.

Shoe lovers beware. These guys will act all friendly and act as if they want to help with the sneaker community. But that's not the case. The skinny  I met these guys a few years ago at several different shoe shows (dxc heated sole) I thought we had built a relationship that was friendly. I purchased (2 shoes) and I sold a few pairs of shoes through them which they charge 20% no problem they sold my shoes and said they would have someone call me to pick up a check well after a few weeks I noticed my shoes had sold but no call I waited another week before I decided to call, they lied and said they just sold the day before and I was going to get a call soon. I went to pick up check I noticed my other shoes had sold as well but they didn't tell me either I let it go as I got my money but felt like they were not telling people as they didn't have enough money to cover checks ,They have no policy in place for holding a check and they seemed to get upset when I asked about it. I would call in to ask if they can relist my shoes on their Instagram page Brandon seemed to have an issue with and said he would have someone look into it but nothing was done. God forbid you go in there and ask about prices being so high they will give you this attitude about prices being set by customers when in fact they recommend pricing as they want to get as much as they can. There is always 2-3 staff hanging out in there and makes it awkward when ur the only shopper and they are just standing there looking at you.  Please be careful of the services they offer, they let me know that they can do a legit check on a shoe for me (make sure they aren't fakes or variants) I thought that was great as there is a lot of fake shoes out here. I finally worked out a deal for a very limited an expensive shoe that I needed to get a legit check so I had the guy meet me there, we go in and it checks out and as I'm closing the deal, Brandon offered him more money that I was able to give. No apology no nothing just a s@$t eating smile like he won the lottery. He also was boastful online about it as to throw it more in my face. Real questionable business ethics, I won't do business with this store again.

Really disappointed with this location and customer service.  The skinny  After a long day at work my gf decided they were going to have sushi for an early dinner and as a non sushi eater they asked what I would like to eat I naturally I selected one of my fav go to spots and finding out they had a closer location was a plus. The hot dogs were ok beans tasted old and was not very warm the cheese tasted like they may use a cheaper cheese than 83rd ave location. The chips they use to top hot dogs tasted stale.  The bad  As soon as you walk in to location u get a foul smell as if they use dirty smelly rags to clean table my gf and daughter couldn't take the smell and waited outside. When I walked in I also was not acknowledged I take it as they thought I was looking at menu but really they should have asked or greeted me and I could have ordered quicker but she decided to take 2 drive through orders before coming to me. The hot dogs were not good and I didn't have my usually great experience I will not come back to this location and travel further out to 83rd ave to get better service and better food.

Never been nervous to visit a dr my entire life until the day I decided to visit this clinic, I decided not be afraid of what people think and what society would judge as a "pothead"  The skinny  I have had back pain since I was a young lad and have visited specialist chiropractors and acupuncturist all have provided temporary relief and the dr's usually prescribe me Vicodin or soma for pain. Both pills make me sick and I am taking another pill for my stomach and the cycle began before I knew it I was taking 3-6 pills a day just for pain and other ailments. I discovered that marijuana provided enough for all my ailments that I may be able to sleep through the whole night and also the cbd's that are in marijuana helped with my pain. I was smoking illegally for years before I decided to protect myself. I was recommended this place by a friend who also has his card and I can't thank him enough, I brought in my medical records and cash for all fees was in and out within an hour or so. The dr was great took time to hear me out and understood my concerns and also explained the pros and cons about my card. I left there feeling like a million bucks like the weight of being arrested for trying to feel normal with no pain.  The bad  The office while it seemed very professional there were a few things that jumped out to me I did hear them yelling at one another and also they seemed to have had a friend visiting while that is ok I would not want a stranger looking at my medical files.  Overall This place is great they will calm your fears and help you get what you need I would recommend to anyone. Just bring your medical records from last year saves you 50$.

The club scene can be a pain especially for the hunt of good music/Dj and drink specials. This place has both if your a hip hop lover. The good Was out on the town Labor Day weekend friend of mine was having his bday get together here. Great choice, the liquor was flowing (Korean vodka rules) the bar team was fast and the Dj (psycho pat) kept the cool hip hop songs going man what a nice place. Although I missed the happy hour I could see they have an awesome HH well worth a trip back early next time I go.  The bad Finding a stall close to it took an hour lol but that's what u will deal with any weekend no biggie. 2 shots of Jameson 16$ yikes but also pretty standard as they place Jameson as a top shelf liquor ugh.  Overall I will be back to check those spam sliders and more of the Korean vodka. This place deserves 4 1/2 stars not 5 but couldn't give it 4 stars friendly staff and owner made the night great.
