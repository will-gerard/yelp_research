My regular nail technician at a different salon was out yesterday.  Being on a time crunch because I'm going on vacation, I decided to give this place a try due to word of the mouth.  As soon as I got there, the staff was not very friendly to me. I was sat down in about 10 mins which is pretty great. I showed the technician a photo of what I wanted.  The shape of the nail is called a coffin shape and she said they charge extra for that....fine I thought.  It wasn't until she was shaping my nails I realized she is doing horrible. I proceeded to tell her they are crooked and not the correct shape, but she didn't do anything about it. Next, she starts to do someone else's nails and a male continued mine. He could not get the shape correct either and I began to get frustrated letting him know I'm not happy how crooked they are. He then pulled my hand and stared at me and said with the biggest tone "which one?!". At this point I gave up and just said never mind it's fine.  I paid $46 for a terrible set of nails with awful customer service.  I will never go back and will spread the word to all of my girlfriends.  There's nothing worse than making a nail experience stressful for your customers. I'm thoroughly disappointed being in the service industry myself on how you handle your guests.  No 'thank yous' were given after anyone left and no friendly 'hellos'....only "what do you want".

I just moved into the neighborhood and was trying to find the perfect new nail spot. This place looks great and the interior is lovely as well. However, the receptionist was very unfriendly and looked at me as if I didn't belong (I had no makeup on nor do I have plastic surgery as the rest of the clientele). I informed her I was new here and asked about the prices and availability right now. She just showed me the menu and said they were booked until 415...After glancing at the menu, my jaw almost dropped. So I suppose I don't fit into this overpriced, judgmental nail place. I left and no one even said goodbye nor did the receptionist ever ask if I needed to make an appointment.

All I have to say is that Lizzie is absolutely amazing.  She is such a perfectionist with her waxes that she never misses a single hair.  I will never go to anyone else.

Went to a Sunday lunch with my mom, but never again.  The service was awful and it wasn't even busy at all.  My mom ordered a chicken flatbread only to find two hairs (not hers) and a piece of plastic wrapper? No thank you...

No you cannot ask me for my service animals papers and no she does not need to wear a vest either.  The manager argued with me about the rights of my service dog.  It is illegal to ask me for papers. "When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person's disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.

I was in a rush to get my nails done before I had work and I was immediately greeted and helped. I let Amy (who did an incredible job) know I had about 45 mins for my gel change and backfill. Not only did she finish early, she even had time to fix my shape and make them look perfect. The staff was so friendly and I am excited I found my new favorite neighborhood nail spa.

After driving past this place a couple times, I finally decided to stumble in.  I was very happy with the service and the food. I highly recommend the coconut soup, it's to die for.  The presentation of my salmon dish was picture perfect. Love this place!

Wasn't impressed. Dressing tasted like a store bought bottle dressing and tomatoes very very mushy.

Friendly employees, fast service, amazing refreshing kale salad, and one of a kind sandwiches.  To top it all off, it's local.  Cannot wait to try all their sandwiches. I met the owner as well who was just amazing.  I highly recommend this place!

Haven't been to the dentist in years and naturally was a bit nervous.  It started out with my phone call and being greeted with such great hospitality that I couldn't wait to come in.   She was able to fit me in right away and figured out my insurance plan as well.  Upon arriving,  I met the receptionist and just as I expected from our previous phone call, she was so kind and happy.   I was seen very quickly and got my X-rays done fairly fast as well.  Then came in the dentist and he was great as well!  Didn't pressure me into getting orthodontics done like most of my previous dentists have nor did he tell me to get my teeth whitened.  I however, wanted some info about Invisalign and the receptionist at the end wrote down all the financials for me.   As I was getting my teeth cleaned, the technician was very informative about what toothpaste I should be using and she was very gentle and never hurt my gums.  Overall, this place is quick and efficient and everyone seems to enjoy their job which makes the whole experience more comfortable.  I can't wait to come back! I highly highly recommend this office. :)
