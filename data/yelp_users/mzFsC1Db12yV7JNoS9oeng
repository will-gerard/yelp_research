First of all the bread they give you as a free appetizer is fabulous... not healthly but amazingly good.  Menu is very diverse and love the specials they have on drinks and food.  Great service.

Very friendly... just great people... just not the most reliable or best results with our yard.  I am going to try them one more time since they are just so great, but the uneven yard and the dying shrubs can only last so long.

How can I explain this place?  It's made a non-sandwich liker (myself) love sandwiches.  The food is absolutely amazing.  Even though it's far out, I'd say everyone should try this place.

The saturday evening crowd made this place hopping but we were able to find a high-top... we wanted to eat healthier (normally hard at a sports grill) and found the Ahi dish and the Grilled Shrimp dishes amazing.  Would recommend it to others and definitely will go back again!

Great indoor/outdoor space... and some very fun drinks.  Would have given 5 stars if service was faster- but it wasn't too big of a deal.   The patio made us feel like we had gone on a vacation- I love that feeling!

I love how they get everything done within a week. They just get s*#t done and it's perfectly done.  Great in and out access and quality of work.

Best place to watch football (and other sports too I guess:))   Q is the greatest bartender and always has our drinks ready for us from the time we walk in the door.  Love the fatty food when you just want to let go, have great service, great sports, and good games.

No yogurt options (most out of 10+ options weren't available) and the toppings were limited at best or stuck together and then they didn't even have a chocolate syrup topping.  Only good thing was that the cotton candy flavor was very delish.

We went here for an escape from the heat- but unfortunately they barely had any A/C on and we only realized this after we had purchased the tickets.  I'd go to any other theatre if your goal is to have a nice cool break from the AZ Summer heat.
