This is the best Szechwan style chinese food in Phoenix in my opinion. When you walk in all the specials are in chinese so it's safe to say it's authentic. The food is pretty cheap and you get a lot of it so another win there. The service is pretty good, I always feel a little awkward because english definitely isn't the first language here but don't worry it won't stop you from getting what you want, the menus are in english and chinese(not sure if it's mandarin or cantonese). Would highly recommend this place, have introduced it to a lot of friends and family both from Phoenix and from out of town.

This was a huge let down. I ordered this along with some co-workers that recommended over Hong Kong Asian Cuisine where I usually order from. I will never stray from Hong Kong Asian Cuisine as this was the worst Lo Mein I have ever had. The noodles were some flat noodle with no sauce or seasoning and could not even take more than a few bites. The fried rice that came with my orange chicken was just brown rice with peas in it. The Orange Chicken was the one saving grace so i had something to choke down but I would never eat here again.

I'm sorry to say but this was one of the worst dining experiences that I have had ever. We had a decent size group of about 10 people so abnormal due to that and hopefully other diners don't experience what we went through.   To start off I had my drink refilled once in a 3 hour time span and that was after attempting to flag down our waiter several times. The service was very slow and the restaurant was busy but no near capacity so I don't have much empathy.   I ordered the New York strip medium and found it closer to medium well but honestly not a big deal if it wasn't for everything else. I will say the steak was lacking severely in seasoning...very bland. The potatoes were amazing so I will give them that.   On to dessert, I got the sorbet. It was decent but nothing to write home about.  On to the reason why I left one star....the check. We waited for about 45 minutes and requested them to bring separate checks. I will admit the one thing we could have done to help ourselves was tell them early on we wanted separate checks for the entire party (5 total due to couples at the table) but I have had medium to large groups countless times and the waiter asks on the front end if we want separate checks.   Anyways, we were told twice they couldn't do separate checks. One couple had to leave and left cash so somehow the waiter took the cash and was supposed to deduct their meal from the tab so we could divvy up the rest since their antiquated system would not allow a division of a check supposedly. Well back came the waiter and AFTER paying over $100 in cash our bill had gone from a little over $300 to $450...fuzzy math right? Long story short on that one he had added the table next to us onto our tab...awesome.  After this latest debacle we asked three times to speak to the manager to clear up the issue, not looking for free stuff or a discount we sincerely just wanted to have the check divided up so we could pay and get the heck out of there.  The first two times with our waiter got us nowhere so we finally asked another waiter to grab the manager which was followed by the manager talking to our waiter for about 15 minutes in our view while we waited to speak to him.  Once the manager arrived he did the impossible! He divided up the checks, we paid...and we left! All together we waited over an hour and thirty minutes to pay a dang check. Unreal. I don't wish ill on the restaurant and hope they see this and use it as a means to improve their customer experience. It looks like most diners here have had better experiences than us but for me I will avoid this place like the plague and go to Sassi just down the road by Troon.
