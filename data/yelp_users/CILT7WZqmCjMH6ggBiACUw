We checked in on a Wednesday night.  I told the lady at the check in desk that it was my husband's birthday and slipped her a $20.  Instead of our cheap non view, low floor room, we were upgraded to a strip view new suite on the 32nd floor.  Nice!  It was awesome and super clean.  I would stay here again, no problem.  Definitely recommend!

TEN stars out of 5!!!!  This place was awesome!  We came here on a Thursday night around 9pm, so there was no wait at all.  Plus, it was Dec. 18th, which I guess is historically one of the slowest times in Vegas.  Anyway, our server went ahead and gave some recommendations for entrees and man, am I glad I went with his suggestions!  My husband and I both ordered the filet with Merlot butter reduction.  I am not even joking, this is most likely the best meal I have ever had in my life.  The filet was PERFECT.  Super tender, moist, and absolutely delicious when coupled with the merlot sauce!  The super thin fries are really interesting.  We also shared a plate of garlic spinach (which, btw, was definitely big enough for 2 to share) which was quite tasty.  For dessert, we got the chocolate mousse which was also excellent!  The service was great.  Our server offered for us to have a taste of the wine we were considering buying a bottle of....and that was indeed a great idea since we liked it a lot and bought the bottle.    Ambiance is very nice and you can't beat an evening view of the Bellagio fountains!  We sat inside right by the window.  We couldn't hear the music when the fountain show was on, but oh well.  That's a very minor drawback.    Overall, it was absolutely fabulous.  Next time we're in Vegas, we are definitely coming back here!

Unbelievably horrible service.  The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because the beignets are incredible and worth a trip just to get them.  Aside from those, the service was deplorable.  We waited a solid 30 minutes for our food on a relatively slow late morning visit.  When I asked about the whereabouts of our meal, our server seemed surprised that I would even ask.  Then, our omelette was lukewarm and tasteless.  The French toast was great, though.  Overall, a truly terrible experience.  We did complain and got the price of the omelette taken off, but I still feel like we should have gotten the beignets and ran!

Super yummy!!!!  I haven't had a nutella crepe since we were in Paris, France!  mmmm mmmm mmmm.  My husband and I shared both the sausage/mushroom crepe and the nutella crepe.  They were both really good.  Sure, the savory one was just like pizza, but it was really good!  You seriously cannot go wrong with nutella, so I have no complaints at all!  yummy yummy yummy!

My husband I decided that this was our last Cirque du Soleil show.  Why am I giving it 5 stars, then?  Because it was by far the best Cirque show we've ever seen, and nothing will ever compare to it again.  Anything else will be a total let down.  The water stage made for an amazing experience.  We sat on the right side of the stage, a few rows up, and it was perfect.  Definitely a memorable experience!  We could, as always, do without the clowns.  They are my only complaint!

So we cheaped out and got the pizza.  I just couldn't stomach paying $27 for chicken tortellini!  Word to the wise:  The pizzas are seriously HUGE!!!!  Please do not order one pizza per person!  That's what we did, thinking we would get meal sized individual pizzas.  Why the server didn't say something is beyond me!  Maybe he thought we really ate that much or something?  We wound up taking almost a whole pizza in a to-go box.  I really enjoyed the bread basket and the olive tray.  It was definitely a nice touch.   I'd come back, but would probably order something else next time.

So, I'm not much of a buffet person, but after reading these reviews (and the fact that we stayed at Paris), I decided we should give it a whirl.  We showed up at about 10:50am on a Thursday, so they were just about to switch out the breakfast items with lunch.  First stop was the omelette station.  I don't think the guy cooked my omelette enough since it wound up being a little runny.  Oh well, the made to order crepes (which are HUGE!!!!!) more than made up for it!  I also enjoyed the little quiches.  The brownies are super yummy....I grabbed one on the way out.  Basically, this is an awesome place to come when you want to eat 20 thousand calories.  :)

Yum!  I wish we had one of these back home.  We purposely hit this place at an odd time for lunch (3pm) to avoid an insane line.  The sandwiches were a perfect size and price.  Finding lunch for under $7 on the strip is unheard of!

This place is great for families!!!  It's classy, and you don't have to walk even one second inside of the casino to get from registration to your room.  Rooms are big and bathroom is huge.  If you are a California resident, they give a substantial discount for rooms (you must call for it).  I think it's the nicest $100 room I've stayed in before.  if you feel uneasy about taking kids to Vegas, I highly recommend checking this place out.

Service was mediocre but the food was surprisingly good.  Loved the atmosphere and it's basically the only option around for miles and miles.  Pulled pork is delicious here!
