I don't know what all the fuss is about this location. When I arrived I was greeted promptly by a friendly face cleaning the sugar milk station. From there I was second in line, waited no more then 15 seconds and was greeted a second time and asked what I'd like. Staff was quick to poor my ice tea.

I love you and all the food you make. If you could hand craft my child I would let you. There is nothing else in the world that matters when you sink your teeth into a bacon burrito. If hitler was given a California burrito a lot of lives would have been saved.

One of life's simple pleasures is loving what you do.  Everyone of the guys that works at cigar king gets to enjoy just that everyday when they show up for work.  It's clear they all love their job.  Few times have I ever walked into a store and experienced the service these guys deliver.  Doesn't matter if you've been there once or this is your 100th time back they are there to help and answer what ever type of question you might have.  When I think of cigar king I think of one of the most "bro" places on earth.  If you are in scottsdale and in need of a cigar, watch, shaving gear or just a place to relax with the bros this is your spot.  Hats off to yelp for connecting me with this brotastic establishment.

I've bought two bikes from these guys in the past year.  My very first bike an iron 883 and a few months later a softail slim.  Cory helped me with both he's now in finance but if you're in there totally recommend asking for him.  Buying a motorcycle here was a unique experience because there is truly no hard selling happening.  At least at this dealership.  Very relaxed atmosphere and they let you rock a gong when you buy a bike.  Cherry on top is all the babes that work there cheer you on as you do it(simple things in life) Besides having a huge selection and an awesome service department it's just a cool spot to stop by especially on Saturdays.  They always have a BBQ going around noon burgers soda and so on.  Can't wait to see the new space which is currently under construction across the street.

I will keep this short and sweet.  This place is dope. If you are in the mood for gelato or ice cream or anything cold and yummy and live in the north scottsdale area this place is an absolute must.  Can't recommend this place enough!

Run, don't walk away from this place.  I'm a slut for a good bowl of soup.  I literally go to sleep at night dreaming about package ramen noodle. After dining in this restaurant today I died a little bit inside.  All I can say about the soup is it smelled awful, had zero flavor, fuck, I'm actually angry I wasted a meal in Vegas at this kennel.  Dined with a total of 8 people. Our food came out in 3 shifts last plate coming out 15 minutes after the first.  Honestly I don't even want to keep writing about it.  Do not eat here.

Came in for dinner a few nights ago.  Service was really fast.  Food was fresh and delicious.  Like other reviews say the sauce is unreal recommend asking for some extra on the side.  I got their gyro combo and will back soon for another.

Dear blue martini:  You're a bar, not a dance club, not a music venue, not anything special!   So why the hell do you charge a cover and inflate your drinks to levels where I feel like I could have purchased an entire bottle for the cost of one rum and coke???  Mayyyyybe if your wait staff was on the caliber of old town and mayyyybe if the average age of the girls I'm about to meet wasn't 40+ I'd raise this rating to a 2, but common, really?  The live band is a nice touch if you're into 1970's style lounge lizard vegas performers.    This review will without a doubt fall on deaf ears but oh well, the people have a right to know.  Thanks yelp for being the only place north scottsdale checks on where to go out.  As for you, the owner, you pretentious Gordon gekko'ish sommmamabish, I hope you're laughing it up knowing I paid $88 for 4 drinks.  Here are the words out of your mouth: "gotcha"

Fantastic pizza.  Got take out tonight was absolutely delicious.  With most pizzas I eat there are a few qualities I look for bread toppings cheese etc.  today it was a little plain pie.  Zest sauce, awesome cheese, and bread similar to my fav spot in ny.

I've only been here for breakfast so this review is based on that.  Also I've only tried two things on their menu at breakfast.  Chicken fried steak and the breakfast burrito.  I would recommend both and would say try the burrito on your first visit.  I like bacon eggs and cheese.  Best part is their salsa they give with it sooo good.  Besides that big earls has the type of home town feel you want when you walk into a breakfast place solo.  A smile and a friendly what can I get you.  The chef there is super friendly often times brings my food out to me directly.  He also told me about the Indian fry bread place down the street and their spinach enchiladas which are so good as well.  Bottom line big earls is hometown, down to earth and exactly what you would expect to get when you walk in and I love it.  Cheers guys!

I am from New York.  Born on the upper east side of manhattan to some yuppie parents and raised on the Gold Coast of Long Island.  I am a snob by nature.  To make matters worse when I was about 19 I decided I was brave enough to try my hand at cooking professionally.  Anywho fast forward about a decade I dropped cooking like a bad habit we don't need to get into what I actually do now. I'm more retired then anything.  Ok getting to the point.  When ever I decide to take a mental health day during the week or when I'm feeling frisky early on a Saturday this is my go to spot.  BEST BAGELS IN PHX.  #fact.  Two fried eggs bacon and cheese on a toasted everything bagel. Don't get fancy at this place stick to the basics and thank me later!

Stopped in for lunch and ordered a Gyro.  Service was fast and friendly.  Food was delicious.  If you are in the mood for a Gyro definitely worth the trip to fountain hills.

Not really sure what people have to complain about here.  Fast, clean, and what you expect from jimmy johns.  Takes a special type of douche bag to complain about a fast food joint on yelp.

I come for the carne asada tacos, endulge in the plethora of margarita flavors (hefe... Do you know what the word "plethora" means?) and if that wasn't enough I typically find myself googly-eying any one of the north scottsdale cougars that frequent city north!  Gotta stop typing my food just showed up and it's becoming really tough to writefghhhvvddrgvb

This is one of those places you always come back to regardless of how you're feeling.  In fact, you may start your day somewhere else and say "let's grab a Negroni over at la bocca my brother"... And then my brother says "ummm duh, does a bear poop in the woods?, does a priest love little boys? Does the average American owe more on student loans than what I owe on my car payment?"... Hells yeah let's go to la bocca!!! Come one come all.  It's chill mixed in with great service and non pretentious bartenders who want to see you good and drunk just like I want!!! I'm looking to my right and there's a woman with a cardinals hat yelling at the tv.  I'm looking to my left and there's a guy drinking a dirty martini.  It's that kind of place.  By the by, the food is top fu**%ing notch brothers and sisters.  I just had a mini orgasm in my mouth.  Don't judge me

Bran new to the old town area. Came for a beer after work. Service was fast and friendly. Got to try the buffalo dumplings that were some of the dopest dope I've ever smoked. Looking forward to trying some of the other HH specials.

Two brothers is the type of spot you want to eat at when you have those Monday blues. Walked in today and got a whiff of that fresh paint smell because they just opened. The smell of money I tell you!  I like to sit at the bar when I go out to lunch, you know really live a little. Jennifer, who's a great bartender, was quick to greet us with a friendly smile and an introduction to their locally made beers. By local I mean brewed above the bar. #ohyoufancy. She gave us a great walk through of each of the beers and asked if we would like one? One I said in shock?! I'll have one of each. By then my co worker was co(drunk)ughing giving me an evil stare.  I said Michelle it's called a flight, ok. I know how to keep it classy.  What's important about Jen is I really wanted to spend the rest of the day enjoying each of their fine hand crafted beers. She wouldn't allow it. With a stern yet pleasant tone she said one and back to work with you. It's good to have responsible people in your life otherwise it would have been me drunk in an uber several hours later. Side note - anyone else ever use an Uber kind of like a therapist? It's great you get into the car drunk get to talk about what ever/ whom ever you want and boom you are home. I love it!  After that I ordered the ham and cheese panini which was more then enough food. Really enjoyed my lunch and look forward to going back.

Really nice addition to high street. No better way to start off an afternoon of driving around in the Arizona heat then a 44oz ice tea.   The staff is really nice and helpful. Very knowledgeable about tea. Jordanna had me try chocolate mocha / Carmel Java which was a complete surprise. My taste buds couldn't decide if I was drinking coffee or tea.   Keep up the good work!
