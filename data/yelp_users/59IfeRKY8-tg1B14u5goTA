I have ordered from this location  multiple times and have never had an issue ever. Tonight I ordered my normal club lulu with no lettuce, regular sprouts, ez onions and I added ez dijon mustard. When I got my sandwich this time, the amount of sprouts was less than ez (even though I ordered regular amount) and there was no dijon mustard  So I called the shop and let them know. The first male on the phone told me that they are cracking down on how much sprouts they put on their sandwiches. When I made the point that the amount on my sandwich was less than ez, the male passed me off to another male (which I am assuming was either the supervisor or store manager).   When he got on the line, he advised me that they apologize for their mistake, but they would not be making me a new sandwich because it is a $7 sandwich.  He also stated that instead, he will make sure to leave a note on my profile stating that future sandwiches need to have extra sprouts and to not forget mustard.   I have never gone to any food establishment  whether it be fast food or a 5 star restaurant and have them refuse to remake an item that a mistake was made on by them. I was truly blown away by what he advised me. I made it clear that there would be no need to not ate my profile as we will no longer order their food after today.   Sadly enough, it took me stating that to have them remake my sandwich. Even with them remaking it, the male I spoke with felt the need to stress the fact that in order for them to bring me a new sandwich, I would have to return the original one...I honestly laughed when he said that because that is common knowledge in the food industry.  The problem with all of this is the fact that when it comes to customer service and the food industry, you always fix the issue at no extra cost to the customer. You never debate with them and treat them the way I was treated. It's sad to see customer service  in the food industry deteriorating .

I was rather excited to order from them when I saw that it got pretty decent reviews.  I was even more excited when I saw they have Singapore Mei Fun.  I noticed that on their menu, there was no description of what type of meat you could choose from  so I wrote in the comments box to add 5 spice bean curd or Tofu(if they didn't have bean curd).  I assumed that since there was no choice of meat in either the description or when placing the order that it didn't come with meat in it.  With that assumption, I thought my comment about adding the bean curd made sense.  Well I received a call right after placing the order from the restaurant.    The gentleman on the phone was unsure what I meant by adding bean curd or tofu.  I had to explain that if they have bean curd, I prefer that.  He then asked me if I wanted $1.00 or $2.00......I had to get clarification on what he meant by that.  I had to ask multiple questions in regards to what the difference was.  All I was able to get out of him was that $1.00 would add about 6 pieces of bean curd. I told him to go ahead and add $1.00 worth of bean curd.....  An hour and 15 minutes later (keeping in mind that I ordered at 2pm, way after church was over when restaurants are the busiest) They arrived at my work which is a block away from them.  When I picked up the food from the front desk, the lady stared at me with a blank stare.  I asked where I need to sign and she advised that I need to pay the $1.08 difference.  I advised her that I was under the impression that my card was going to be charged the updated total once I added bean curd.  Nope not the case, her reply when I stated that the gentleman on the phone didn't specify that I needed to have cash on me(which I don't) to pay for the difference instead of them making it easier by charging my card that they already had from my order.  Instead, I was advised that I have to call a separate number not related to their restaurant and pay the difference.....Interesting.  The best part about all of this is that the item I ordered has beef, chicken, pork AND shrimp in it.....Oh we cannot forget about my 6 pieces of bean curd.   So all of the frustration could have been avoided if their menu had a simple description and/or option to choose a meat that I would have preferred.

I originally was going to Red Star Vapor and my co-worker told me to go to OHM instead because their juices are a much higher quality. And can I just say that he was sooooo right!!! The only reason I will go to Red Star is to use the last of my points and buy coils.

Absolutely amazing!! I really hope they decide to open a location in Queen Creek. We really need an ice cream parlor out here.
