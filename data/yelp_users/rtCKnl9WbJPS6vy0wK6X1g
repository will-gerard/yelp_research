My first and second delivery experiences with this business were not the best however since then they have made up tremendously for their mistakes. The wings are still the best I've ever had. They are made fresh every weekend. My favorite wings are the honey hot wings. However I still get my order late if I order through Grub Hub (WITHOUT FAIL) even though I'm only a mile or so away from the business.

Still sadly disappointed in this location, I've never been so let down. I even spoke to Donna the manager and my stuffed crust pizza still came out a limp soggy mess. I know for a fact it isn't supposed to be this way! I've ordered from this location three times and my pizza has always come out soggy. I've posted a picture if you're not convinced. I'd rather drive a few miles to pick up my pizza from the Broadway and McClintock location than have a soggy pizza that I can't even pick up with my hands.

Great service. Great food. Great indoor and out door area. Amazing music. Amazing fries ( I call them Crack Fries), Greek bread & hummus. Not a fan of the giant cups that are mostly filled with ice though.

This place is right down the street from my house. I used to go to the salon at Tempe market place but I saw their reviews on yelp and decided to take a chance on it (call it laziness). I am really pleased with my results. I'm not sure who care of me, but the ladies did a really great job!!!! They took their time and made sure I was happy. I'm very picky when it comes to my nails and they were very patient with my indesiciveness. My acrylic and gel nails were absolutely stunning and perfect! I will be going back! In my opinion the prices were good the same as Tempe marketplace...But I feel like they valued me as a customer  Oh by the way they have really great pedi massage with the hot stones and everything ^_^

Update: I will no longer be going to this location.  I almost had a anxiety attack right there at the counter. The woman who was doing my nails kept seconds guessing me. Then proceeded to tell me to go to another shop. She finally gave up arguing  after I told her this was the worst customer service is had. She pawned me of to someone else.   The last straw for me was the fact that no one told me they were going to charge me more for the extra line across my tips. So even though I got a "fill" I paid for a whole new set of nails.

I can't stop raving about this place its a bit pricey but their food is amazing. All of their meat is juicy and flavorful. I've never been disappointed with the service.  I'm in love with their Samosas and Garlic naan. I wish it was endless!! Everyone I take here loves it. My only word of advice is to be sure you ask for the spice level you really want and commit to it lol.

I always enjoy myself when I come here I typically get hookah next door but I always try to get an appetizer or dessert or some tea from the the Mijana Side. They never fail to impress me!

So glad I came into those location to get some assistance. After I had THE WORST experience with the customer care line over the phone. But I walked into the store this morning and the manager Lebs said he'd do his best to help me out. . .I even called customer care while I was in the store and the supervisor said they weren't able to assist-They even hung up on me! But Lebs fixed my issue ! Wooohooo. So glad I came in tothi this location! SUPER  happy my issue was resolved!!! A+ for this store and Mr.Lebs!

My roommate & I decided to try this place out yesterday,  we saw that it was finally open. I'm so glad we did! The ambiance is amazing! The colors were refreshing. The general layout of the resturant was very open & airy. The food was unique & fresh my a Basmati  rice had pomegranate & Quinoa in it. My roommate ordered the zucchini linguine which was very flavorful & the portion size was perfect. I ordered the Chicken Protein Bowl....The flavor in the chicken was to die for! Very juicy & flavorful! We also ordered the fries & Pomegranate Frozen Yogurt. Of course they were both amazing! We both have worked in customer service & we really enjoyed our waiter he went above and beyond to assist us. The general manager was also there and was very polite and inviting.
