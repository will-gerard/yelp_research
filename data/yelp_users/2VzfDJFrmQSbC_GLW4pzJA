No matter when my mom, sister, niece and I go... the food is AMAZING, the coffee bar is DELISH and the employees are FANTASTIC!  It is a busy place but so worth the line at the counter. Die hard fan here!

I think it is time that I write a review for this joint! I have been coming to TLC Wash N Clean on and off for the last 7 years. This laundry mat has an attendant there at all times. You can even drop off items to be cleaned for you. A lot of washers (some regular size and some gigantic!) and lots of dryers. There is also a soda and snack machines and bottled water or ice cream for sell. If you need quarters.. you can get them there from a machine or buy rolls from the attendant as well. Free wifi and flatscreen on the wall to watch TV (satellite) while waiting for your laundry to finish. Definitely love coming here. Get my laundry done within an hour and a half and I am back home!

My daughter and I went for the first time on Sunday and was quite surprised. There was a huge line and there is a reason why. The hot dogs are delish and the fries are super awesome with either the cheese sauce or the malt vinegar mixed with ketchup... YUMMOH!  We will be back to try the shakes, burgers and onion rings!

I have to say hands down that this is the best chinese food I have had to date! We have ordered delivery a couple times here (a total of 4 different dishes and 2 appetizers) and the food was fresh and very flavorful. It must mean something also when you call and the phone rings a lot and then they place you on a hold (phone on the counter) while taking orders that came in ahead of you. This place is B-U-S-Y!!  Delivery is actually quicker than they stated on the phone and the delivery peeps are nice. So we have tried the Beef/Broccoli, Szechuan Chicken, Diced Chicken with cashews Chicken with fresh mushrooms & snow peas, the crab ragoons and the steamed meat dumplings. EVERY SINGLE DISH WAS DELISH!!! And to top it, the food is delivered looking good too. Not in the traditional white boxes, but black bowl containers with clear lids.  This is will be a mainstay for my famile!

Let me start off by saying the employees were very nice. I was able to get seated right away as well and I enjoyed my ice tea, but that is where the positive experience ended. I took my mom to have dinner and we both ordered the Pollo Rosa Maria with grilled asparagus which costs an additional  $1.50 and that is fine, however when I tried to cut it in half it was like cutting into hard straw. Then I tried to put a piece in my mouth and I had to spit it out as it was like chewing into hard straw... these were even skinny stalks. So the $17.00 cost for the chicken was just that.. just the chicken. No sides accompany this unless you want  to pay more. The chicken itself was terrible tasting and super salty. I only ended up taking a small bite and was done.  I had ordered us Ceasars salad and a shrimp appetizer. The lettuce was completely white and came drenched in dressing. Simply could not force myself to put any of that into my mouth. And the appetizer never came. I asked my waiter for the manager letting the waiter know that nothing he did was wrong well accept never bringing us the appetizer.  Manager came and I delicately explained everything to him. He was nice and said they would take care of the bill asking us if we wanted to order something else. I just couldn't do it. I was already passed being hungry and did not want to risk waiting another 30 minutes or so for another meal. I definitely do not recommend spending hard earned money here. It was very disappointing.

I thought it high time that I do a review for this restaurant. The staff is very attentive, the manager comes by to make sure all is well. The atmosphere and music is very lovely. And the food...  I have brought extended family here several times and the food is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  It is one of me and my daughter's favorite places to come and feast.  The only complaint I have is that the water and tea taste bad. Tap water is no good. So we always buy a soda or margarita! I do recommend this place... and definitely try the Chicken Enchilada Suiza with Green sauce!!!

I tried this place out for the first time about 4 wks ago when my office moved into the area. I have had three different sandwiches (Crab Californian, Big Dipper and the Pastrami Melt) and everyone of these were AMAZING! Very fresh, flavorful and no after tastes as I would get from JimmyJohn's. I also keep ordering their Garden Salad that is made with wonderfully fresh vegies!  AND THEY DELIVER at this location.. SUPER PLUS in my books. I wish they had a location in Gilbert too!  The employees have always been super nice on the phone and during their deliveries. LOVE THIS JOINT!

I actually found this company here on Yelp and line the reviews I read so I gave then a try.  The two ladies that came hand their work cut out for them as this house needed a deep cleanse. We move in over a year ago and it was just dirty. Cupboards, baseboards, windows , bathrooms... just nasty. When I came home I could smell the clean walking up to my front door. My house is clean and feels great!! And these ladies did this in 2 hrs! They did a fantastic job and I have already scheduled them again in 30 days!

I have been to Delightful Nails a handful of times now and seen 2 different nail techs and have been VERY happy with their work!  I highly suggest them to anyone. AND they just moved into a larger suite that holds a lot of pedi and nail stations!!! My daughter and I will be back in a couple weeks for another fill and pedi. I have decided they are my go to now!!!!

I was referred to Stephanie Walker through a friend. I cannot say enough about this dentist. The whole staff is very kind, compassionate and professional at the same time. I felt comfortable with them the moment I walked into the front door. It is decorated beautifully in the office.. even the bathroom. Very clean and organized with up-to-date technology. Dr Walker has such a caring touch and is very good at what she does.  I have always been one to HATE going to the dentist, but have now referred her many of my family and friends. Quite a few of my reluctant family members have already been to see her and used her services. I highly recommend Dr Walker and her staff to one and all!

What a hidden gem!  My mother and I have been wanting to try this place out for a couple of months now (very excited about the pure clean eating advertised). Not to mention the gentleman that told us about this place had been to BlueLemon over 20 times in the last 3 months... now you know you have to try a place like that. I mean that is a lot of times to go to one restaurant. So finally went yesterday afternoon about 5:30pm. There is a lot of seating there inside and outside. Very trendy fresh looking restaurant. At the time we arrived there were probably 8 tables being used... which was nice to not have to wait. Timing was perfect. We ordered our food at the counter and sat where we wanted and within minutes are dinner plates were delivered. THAT WAS FAST!  We had the Oriental Salad, sweet potato fries and the Artichoke and Fire-Roasted Tomato Chicken dish. WOW! Very tasty plates and very filling. We also ordered their frozen mint lemonade which we were surprised to see that the mint and lemon were actually juiced there on site. We enjoyed our drinks and excited to try their Frozen Lavendar Lemonade on our next trip there. We also ordered the Hazelnut Cake (from a local bakery).. only ate half and took the rest home. We were stuffed to the gills ... all night long.  The staff were very friendly and very helpful!  We are planning on going again this weekend for breakfast. CANNOT WAIT!

This is a new location for Cafe Rio. I have been a die hard fan since it opened up years ago in Gilbert off Baseline and Gilbert Rd. It is really busy so best not be starving as it will put you in a funk real quick. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the food and my fav are their salads and house dressings. Both the dressings are delish! Now with this new location.. the parking sucks due to having way too many businesses jammed in one area. And their service line has not been fine tuned yet. They will eventually get it. My only complaint really is they are typically slammed (because the food is freaking delish!) and it takes some time to get through the line. But worth it at the end. No problems with the workers there either. They seem to be friendly.

""Because I'm Happy"... yep that song is blasting through my head right now!  I actually really love burgers at SmashBurger's and was thrilled that one just opened up on my end of town.  My son and I went for a norm and as usual.. they did not fail us!  This location just opened up a few weeks ago. .very nice inside and they are super fast and very friendly!   AND I just saw on their menu that they provide gluten-free as well!   I have a few different sandwiches I must try and report back as soon as possible. The only reason this is not a 5-star is because the parking is fierce. There are a lot of excellent eateries in this little area and it is packed!

Pizza a Metro recently opened up (used to be Via's pizza). My brother had told me he went for a pizza (pie) there to try it out. They have a woodstove that they cook their pizzas in. He was very impressed. So.. I took a chance and brought my daughter along.  The restaurant is really lovely inside and has linen table cloths and napkins. The staff are very nice and very attentive. Of course there was only one other couple there at the time. So not sure how they would measure up to a full house. My daughter ordered her usual.. lasagna and I ordered a pizza. Now I will say this.. their sauce on the lasagna was in one word.. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!  However their need to tighten up their technique when it comes to both dishes. The pasta was WAY OVER COOKED. And the pizza was not cooked completely.  When you pick up a piece of pie and it hangs down to the floor... there is a problem there. I ended up taking the outer crust and dipping it into the sauce... because again.. it was AMAZING! If they can perfect their cooking methods.. I will be back, but not until then.

Checked out The Vue at Augusta Ranch today and I was not disappointed!  Great atmosphere with a great view of the golf course. I tried the smoked wings... and let me tell you... the wings were REMARKABLE!!! I love wings and these were by far the best I have had to date! They have really tasty chicken street tacos and feel in love with The HOUSE Steak .. filet mignon seared and skewered over a bed of steamed spinach, crimini mushrooms, roasted red peppers ... this entree was incredible..even down to the veggies. And I have to tell you, I don't care for the taste of veggies at restaurants.  They seems to taste funny. Nope... not this dish. I just wish I had more!!! Both my mother and I thoroughly enjoyed his meal!!! (I have a couple of pics... not the best shots in the world, but here they are).

Well let me fill you in.... this place ROCKS!!! First time eating here. From the moment you enter the establishment,  you are greeted by very friendly staff and everyone you walk by says hello with a sincere smile. The decor is classy, rustic charm to it... from floor to ceiling. The chandelier is over the top fabulous!! My mom and I were seated right away and everything from drinks, appetizers and entrees oh and dessert were delivered in great time! No long waits in between any of the courses. Everything we ordered had great flavor.. cooked perfectly! Every item on our table was fresh. And when I took my first bite of my sirloin steak ... I took a trip down memory lane to when my dad used to grill his famous T-bone steaks on the grill. Literally for me this was soul food.  Appetizer: Crab cakes - they tasted freshly made (not out of a freezer) and had a bit of a kick... just thee best crab cakes I have had by far.  The Caesar side salad was just as yummy... the dressing rocked and there was thick shaved parmesean....so yummy! The sauteed fresh veggies tasted so good. No funny taste like they came from a bag in the freezer (you know what I'm talking about) and a lovely rice pilaf to boot. Then we ordered the Death by Chocolate cake to share... did not disappoint at all!!! Again the staff was very attentive and the manager came by several times to make sure we were doing fine and even cleared dishes off or topped our tea off. That doesn't mean our waiter was not around. He was there just the right amount of times checking on us and clearing dishes and filling our glasses too.  When leaving... the same.. every employee you crossed paths with or caught their eye.. they said thank you for coming in and have a great weekend.  Bottom line...  we WILL be back and as often as possible!

Well Cafe Zupas has officially LOST my patronage (and I eat here a LOT!).  Tried to order our lunches as normal for the office and the guy had me move to the 2nd register for a gal to take my orders and said next time just go there so I didn't have to wait in line. So I did and the girl said it would be an hour wait before she could even start my order. I said fine... I will go back to the line and handle it there and she told me that would not work as the orders would get lost. I bet if our happy asses were standing in line this wouldn't be a problem. No different and you would have made good money! ...BYE FELICIA!
