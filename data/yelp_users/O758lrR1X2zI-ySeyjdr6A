The service is ok but the food was terrible! I had eggs benedict and I was greatly disappointed! The hollandaise sauce was nasty, the ham was cold and the english muffin was cold as well. The potatoes aren't seasoned and instead of cooking the onions with the potatoes, it looks like they just sprinkled the onions on top! The only reason I gave it two stars is because the apple juice and coffee were both good!!

This is really one of my favorite places to get some good cajun food!  Their fried catfish is nice and crispy, their blackened catfish is juicy and spicy and their red beans and rice are quite tasty.    Let's talk about their gumbo....hmmm....hmmm... good!  They offer three different types: chicken and sausage, seafood and duck and sausage.  I really love the seafood gumbo, but don't sleep on the duck and sausage.  It has a different flavor, but it's wonderful.    If you're in Phoenix, you have to try this place.  You'll feel like you're in the Big Easy!!

If you are looking for some honest to goodness, authentic Mexican food, Carolina's is it! Their green chile, machaca chimichanga will make you wanna slap your mama!  Be careful though! This place is in the hood! However, that's where you can find some of the best food!

You can't go wrong with Houston's! I've been to the one in Miami, Atlanta, Phoenix, Scottsdale and Chicago (the Chicago one closed) and they are all fabulous! The service is outstanding and the spinach dip is awesome! Actually, everything on the menu is great! Don't forget the dessert too! The apple walnut cobbler is yummy! I love this restaurant!

I wish I had better things to say about this place but I don't! The atmosphere is wonderful as we sat in the courtyard. However, our server was terrible. He rushed us to take out order and he had a nasty attitude to boot. We ordered a bottle of wine and had soup and salad. My soup was great but our salads weren't anything to write home about.  Once I got home, I checked my account balance and out waiter charged me twice for the meal! Wth!

The food was very good but I wasn't crazy about the stuffed mushrooms! They weren't bad but they weren't great either! I had veal franchese and it was very good. The veal melted in your mouth and the flavor was outstanding. It comes with pasta with tomato sauce which wasn't bad. The caesar salad with anchovies was really good and they pour a very healthy glass of wine! I ain't mad at 'em! :)

This is a very good Italian restaurant and the service is fabulous! I first came here when my mom was dying of cancer, and I would come here to take a break from the hospital. The staff was very sympathatic to my pain, and really helped me through a tough time!  I've been back several times since, and I continue to get a warm fuzzy feeling whenever I return! The food is wonderful! The veal picatta and the lobster ravioli are awesome!  The service can be a bit slow at times, but the good more than makes up for it! Oh yeah, the warm bread with the garlic pesto is wonderful!

The produce and meat department are excellent but terribly over priced!! I find it quite interesting that they say their seafood has never been frozen, yet we live in the desert? Yesterday I bought some tilapia for $12.99/lb. That's really expensive for tilapia! I wanted to get some Chilean Sea bass but that was $36.99/lb!! Really??? I can get it cheaper in a restaurant and at least they cook it for you!

I can only give this place 4 stars, because I am from the Chicago Area and I am proud to say that I am also an "Official Chicago Pizza Snob!"  Everyone knows the best pizza comes from Chicago (Be Quiet all you New Yorkers!!)  With that said, Oregano's does a good job at attempting to duplicate the Deep Dish Chicago Style Pizza.  The crust is not that of Gino's East in Chicago, but it's not a bad second.  I wish they offered shrimp on their pizza like Giodarno's in Chi-Town offers, but they do offer "hatch green chilis" (A total Southwest thang!)  Nevertheless, I like it and it's good for my Chicago Pizza Fix!!  :)

I decided to go here because many of my friends have raved about the freshness of their food. I bought a halibut filet and it was ok, but I did find three bones in it. I hate finding bones in my fish filets! I also got excited when I went to the meat department and saw an array of sausages! I ended up getting some andioulle sausage. This was the worst sausage I have ever had in my life!!! I grilled them and they came dry and completely flavorless! They were awful! I can't express how disappointed I was! I think I'm going to stick with Whole Foods!

I wanted to give this place 5 stars because it is truly a wonderful jazz/wine bar. However, I really hate that they don't have their strongest vocalists and/bands on Friday and Saturday nights! Dennis Rowland is there on Thursday nights and Ms Reed is there on Monday!  The atmosphere is off the chain though! July in Scottsdale is brutal, with temps hitting 100+ for most of the month! As a result, this bar decorates the place complete Christmas decor, complete with stockings, Christmas lights,.Christmas tree and presents! They call it Christmas in July, in hopes of creating a winter wonderland to help us forget about the hot temps outside! Priceless! Just a wonderful bar! I just wish Dennis was there on Friday!

I can't say enough good things about this place! The shoe department is my favorite department followed by tbd. I didn't think I could love a store as much as I loved Marshall Field's in Chicago! In fact I had to have a moment of silence when Marshall Field's closed! However, Nordstrom's is a close second! Also, Fashion Square Mall rocks!

I used to love this place before they changed their menu.  They use to have this awesome chimichanga, which was filled with peppers, spicey pork and lots of other goodies.  I always got it with the white cheese sauce.  Let me tell you, this chimichanga was DA Bomb!!  However, for some reason, they took it off the menu!!  Ugh!! The food is still pretty good though, but I miss that chimichanga more than you know!  In fact, let's have a moment of silence, please!  :)

The pizza here is pretty good.  That's saying a lot from me, because I'm a true pizza snob!  (Sorry, I'm from the Chicago area and we all know that Chi has the best deep dish pizza, EVER!!) Anyway, I had the sausage, spinach and garlic pizza and the flavor was outstanding.  Be prepared to wait for at least an hour or so before you are seated.  It's always a long line to get in.

I really enjoy this place and have eaten there several times. They just recently changed their menu but I like the brew additions. The coconut shrimp are awesome and the ahi tuna salad is to for for!  I did have the chimichurri flank steak sliders but they weren't good. Our waitress was great and offered me something else.

This place is so awesome! You feel like you're in a little, off beat restaurant in Chicago or New York, instead of Phoenix! The service is very friendly. It's a small place but the food is excellent and big! If you've never had a pasty, you must try it! It's like a pastry filled with love!   I usually get the Cajun Chicken Pasty which is filled with spicy chicken, bacon, ham and swiss cheese! Today I'm trying the pork sausage, potatoes and cheese!

This is one of my favorite breakfast places in the valley! However, you need to get there early on the weekends because it gets crowded. It's not too bad of a wait, about 25 to  35 minutes.   I love their apple crepes and the bacon is really thick and yummy! Don't sleep on the blueberry crepes either! They are delicious! If you like fluffy omelettes then you will love the omelettes here. I still prefer the omelettes at Waffle House.  They also have wonderful skillet breakfasts as well!  Great coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice!

I had my reservations about going to an upscale Mexican restaurant because we all know the best Mexican food can be found in Da Hood at a real dive!  However, against my better judgment, I decided to give this place a try!  NOTE TO SELF: TRUST YOUR DAMN GUT!  The atmosphere is lovely but the food is quite marginal!!  The food is a bit too busy with too many ingredients because they are trying to be upscale and different!  I ordeed the enchilada veracruz,.which was supposed to be a chicken and spinach enchilada with jack cheese and tomatillo sauce! There was little to no cheese, I could barely see the sauce and it had no flavor!! The only saving grace was the wonderful bartender who exchange my dish for tacos!   Will trust my gut next time!

This is a pretty cool place, especially if you love Frank Sinatra! His music is often playing overhead and I love it!    The sauce they make has a bit of a sweet flavor to it, but it works! They also make their own italian sausage and it's wonderful. The ravioli is quite tasty and the thin crust pizza with spinach, sausage, garlic and mushrooms is to die for!  I'm a true pizza snob because I generally only like Deep dish, Chicago Style Pizza from The Windy City, but this is a pleasant place for pizza!

This is a  semi-private country club which has a partnership with the Gainey Hyatt. Only members and guests of the Hyatt can play the golf course and utilize the amenities. My parents have been members for 25 yrs and I just recently became a member! It's a wonderful social place and the atmosphere is lovely! The golf course is always in tip top shape and the staff is awesome! The Members Grill serves up great food and the pro shop always has great looking golf outfits for both men and women! Just a great country club!

Well, it started off good but quickly went down hill!!! I bought a Groupon which clearly stated that if you purchased the groupon for $15 , then you would get $30 worth of food and drink.  The Groupon said 50% off.  Well, when the bill came, the waitress said, you have to spend $30 and then they would take $15 dollars off.  I talked to the manager because, to me this was false advertisement!! Initially he agreed with the waitress, saying that the owners didn't mean to print that. I stood firm in my argument because I knew he was wrong. I've purchased other groupons and they do not require you to spend 30 bucks in order to get discounted what you paid upfront.  This was bullshit and I politely let them know!  The food was just average, and our waitress was rude after I told her that we still left her a20% tip despite the mix up!! I will not be going back!!!

I went there for a meeting with my Smart Set sisters and it was delightful! I had the grilled salmon over kale and mash potatoes and it was awesome! However, the piece of salmon was a bit small. I know it was lunch, but the cut of salmon was skimpy--good but skimpy. Everyone else had the salmon cake salad and they rave it! The ambiance was nice and the service was very good! I would given it 4 stars but I can't let go of how small my piece of salmon was!

I was really disappointed!! I've been to the Atlanta location several years ago and I really enjoyed it. However, I was really disappointed with our dining experience here in Scottsdale! The meat was very tough and everything just about tasted the same! My husband and I decided to go out for a much needed date night. We had 7:30 reservations and we were seated promptly! That was good. But once we were seated it took 10 minutes for someone to come and greet our table. Meanwhile, a party of four were seated after us and they were greeted right away! Finally, the server came over and did his bit but it was very lack-luster. Finally we got our drinks and went to the salad bar. I turned my card over and it took several minutes for the any of the Gauchos to make their way over to us. Once they showed up the meat was tough and burnt! Our bill was $165.00 with tip. Ugh! Now I don't mind paying top dollar for good food and service, but that was a bit ridiculous! I should have gone to Orange Sky instead! I rarely write bad reviews, but this place deserved it!

This is one cool place.  It's located in. Fashion Square Mall, so after a great day of shopping it's nice to come here and have their signature martini, Retail 2moro Therapy!  The lobster chowder is amazing and has a generous amount of chopped lobster in it and the flavor is outstanding! It even has bacon in it and you know everything is better with bacon. The prices are a bit high, $18.00 for a hotdog is a bit much, but then again you aren't going there for a hotdog! Great service and the bar is awesome!

Wow! I stopped by Talking Stick Casino to play a little blackjack, when I decided to give this a whirl! I ordered the seafood gumbo and the chef asked me, "1 to 10, how spicy do you like it?" I'm normally not a wimp, so I replied, "10 of course!" Boy was that a mistake! It was so hot that I couldn't eat it and I had to send it back!  Hot food doesn't bother me, but I couldn't take it! Once I brought the heat index number to 6, the gumbo was very good! I can't give the place 5 stars because I make the best gumbo! I've spent a lot of time in N'Awlins so I know good gumbo!

I was driving home from work and decided I wanted something different for dinner! I've only had the gumbo here and it's very good! I can't day excellent because anyone that knows me knows I make the best gumbo, outside of my mom, Sylvia Sr.. Anyway, the gumbo is jammed packed shrimp, scallops, andioulle sausage, crab, okra and bursting with flavor. They ask you if you like it hot on a scale from 1 to 10. DON'T SAY 10!  I like spicy food and I'm no wimp, but I can't eat it that hot. If you like heat, go for a 7! Trust me! That's plenty hot!  They also have other cajun favorites like red beans and rice, seafood creole and a seafood boil!  The service is great! It's not a sit down place but more like a bar that serves good food! The mix up the food right in front of you.

The service at the bar is phenomenal! John gave me the menu and told me to make a few choices first, before offering his advice! He, then, made me this awesome margarita and suggested the machaca chicken taquitos after listening to my taste preference! It was a hit!  Make sure to sit at the bar and ask for John! Great bartender, great service and he has a cute butt! Cheers!

I'm surprised at some of the reviews, because I found the food to be quite tasty and the service was awesome!!  I sat at the bar,.like I always do when I go out alone, and the bartender waited on me right away!! He offered some great suggestions and then I finally decided on the Pizza Brando!! The bartender, who speaks Italian, told me the pizza was named after him.  The pizza came with spicy salami, sweet onion, buffalo mozzarella, parmesan and gorgonzola cheese. I added some italian sausage and a little extra cheese!! OMG!! The pizza melted in my mouth!!! It was awesome!! This is a must try!!

OMG!! The chimichanga with machaca and green is to die for!! I had to slow down because I was eating it so fast and I knew I would get heartburn if I didn't pace myself!! The chips and salsa were also amazing, as well as the rice and beans!! The only fault is that they don't serve alcohol!! A nice margarita would have been perfect to wash it down!! However, you can bring your own liquor if you want! There's a Walgreens down the street!!

This place was horrible! The service was bad and I swear to you, the placed smelled like sweaty feet! I came here a group of people from work and it took forever! We waited for an hour and a half, only to get luke warm pizza! One of my co workers asked for change for his parking meter and the server rudely replied, "no" and then walked away!  I will never go back!

This is the worst place when it comes customer service! We called and made reservations a week ago and they said the could accommodate 20 people without any problem! We then called the morning of and told them we were on our way. We got there at 11am and we didn't get our good until 12:45! The good didn't come out together and it was not even hot! When we asked to speak to the manager,.Beau, he said he was too busy to speak with us.  It got so bad that my manager marched back to the kitchen and asked him to come out and talk to us. He didn't move. We all ended up writing emails to their corporate office and the owner responded. He acknowledge that their service was unacceptable and offered to make it up to us. However, I have no plans of returning!

This a new place in the neighborhood and I just love it!! I had one of the skillet breakfasts and it was egg-celent!! I kill me!! Anyway, they have a large variety of food and the portions are generous!  They also freshly squeeze both their apple and orange juices!! Becky was our server and she was awesome!! If you go there, ask for Becky and ask her to ask you about fresh cake and a ski mountain in Aspen!! lol!!  Great friendly place!!

I really enjoy this breakfast joint! The service is always prompt and the place is very clean.  I enjoy their skillet breakfasts and the french toast isn't bad. I also like that they have different kinds of coffee.

I'm not sure why this place only averages 3 stars? Every time I've gone I've had great service and really good food! I absolutely love their eggs benedict with hash browns!

Just a good solid burger place!! The burgers are cooked  to order over an open flame grill, and the fries are like steak fries! Yum!! The burgers are a good size and they have a buy one get one fry deal going on! They only have American cheese, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars! Also, the price is a little bit high for combo- $9.50.

Wow! Wow! wow! The food here is simply amazing! My fellow helpers didn't steer me wrong! My dad had spaghetti and meatballs and he thoroughly enjoyed it! I had the shrimp and gnocchi in a brandy cream sauce and it was awesome! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a BYOB. There is a liquor store next door, but I prefer to have my server bring my drink to me rather than getting my own! Also, my gnocchi dish could have had a few more shrimp! The owners are great though!!

I am truly a pizza snob since I grew up in the Chicago area! Deep dish pizza is king in Chi-Town, but I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this super thin crust pizza! My husband and I doctored it up by adding more cheese, bacon and onions which took it over the top!! I must say, I was pleasantly surprised!

I was excited to see a new restaurant in my neck of the woods, but this one fell flat!  I ordered the surf and turf skewer and it was happy hour, which means $3 off all apps and drinks!! Yeah, I thought! Well, the menu said "prawns" as in plural! However, when my appetizer arrived it had one prawn (and I think it was just a jumbo shrimp and not a prawn) and 2 very small pieces of well done filet! WTH!! I asked the bartender why I only got one "prawn" when the menu said prawns---with an "S!" In between talking to her friend at the bar about how often the two of them hung out and ate oysters--a conversation I didn't want or need to hear--she replied, "Oh, the Happy Hour appetizer only comes with one prawn!" (Again, I use the term "prawn" with much reservation!) In my humble opinion, that should have been indicated on the menu or, at the very least, explained prior to me getting this lack lusture appetizer! Had I know, I would have ordered the regular appetizer! In addition, the food needed some seasons! It was bland and over priced!

Omg! I had the prime rib burger and about lost my mind!!! It was amazing!! I added bacon to my burger and it was over the moon good!! I would have given it 5 stars but $16 for a burger is a tad steep, but I guess it was worth it! Our server was wonderful too!! Just a good place for a burger and beer!!

My husband and I went their for a much needed date night and it was wonderful! We're so happy to have such an awesome restaurant with great ambiance! I had the lamb chops and they were superb! My hubby had the Chilean Sea Bass and he loved it! Great place to take out of town guests, instead of taking them to some chain restaurant! The service was impeccable and they have live music!! Oh yeah, the appetizers were great too!!

It's a pretty good burger and the customer service is great, but they did mess up my last order! Also, I asked for a fried egg on my burger and the egg was a tad over cooked! I like my yolk just a tad runny and my egg was cooked firm. The fries are awesome though!

I love this place!! I've been going to the one off Dysart Road for a couple of years, so I was happy when they opened one down the street from me!! Their eggs Benedict will change your life and their omelettes are awesome! Great service too!
