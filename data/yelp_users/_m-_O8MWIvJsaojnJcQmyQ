Yellow Cab is the MOST untrustworthy and unprofessional cab company I have EVER dealt with.  They double charged me for an expensive cab ride.  They will not take care of you if you call them with a complaint.  You do not get to speak to a manager.  They refuse to come to the phone.  I am going to small claims court.

The owner was completely unprofessional, called me stupid repeatedly and tried to charge me a fifty dollar fee for adding water to my radiator. I wouldn't go here again if he paid me!  It was the most ridiculous attempt to get money for doing nothing that i have ever seen. In top of that he tried to charge  me almost two hundred for an oil change and adding coolant. What a crook!

Love the Delux Burger...Medium with extra aioli .  yum.  The panini's are fantastic and I love the grocery carts the sweet potato fries come in.  But the heavenly milkshakes are the best!  haagen daz.  Ooh hoo.

I absolutely loved my bartender Joedee. She made the whole outstanding experience even better. I tried the entire happy hour food menu. My number one fav was the fish tacos followed by the hush puppies. And my drink was the cucumber gimlet, fresh squeezed lime juice and delectable. A must try
