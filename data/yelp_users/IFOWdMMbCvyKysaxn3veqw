THE best sandwich. I've tried all of the few options, but the mozza is the best. Don't even worry about anything else. Fresh mozzarella made on the premises -- and some of the best damn bread.  Absolutely fresh ingredients -- and many are locally grown!  At $8 a sandwich, it's a little expensive, but you can share . . . and totally worth it. Best. Sandwich. In Phoenix.  Go for take-away or just walk across the street to Steele Indian School Park for an impromptu picnic.

Stopped in with some friends after a hike around South Mountain. We came in for a nice breakfast/lunch on a Sunday, around noon.  I ordered the Chilaquiles based on Mary Rose Wilcox's suggestion (I love chilaquiles and have had too many experiences with lackluster versions to not ask). My co-eaters ordered a plate of flautas, chiles rellenos, huevos rancheros, and a bean and cheese burrito.  The food came out fast (the restaurant was nearly empty) and it was excellent! The flour tortilla was thick and light and delicious. The chilaquiles were a little different from what I expected, but they were still quite delicious. The beans were excellent (Mexican restaurants must have fabulous beans, it's the litmus test).  The whole experience was lovely. In fact, the only minus I have of the whole experience was a series of typos on the menu. But hey, the food was delicious!

Absolutely delicious! Had the Paneer Masala and the Malai Masala, with garlic naan and rice.  Heavenly! One of the best Indian restaurants in the Valley. We had the medium spice, which I'd rank at closet to a 7 on a 1-10 scale.

Wow.  We were looking for Chinese near our house and didn't want the so-so buffet down the street. I had tried this place before, but only for a light snack while my tire was being fixed. It looked intriguing enough that I kept it in the back of my mind for quite a while. Unfortunately, the decor kept me from rushing back (I don't have many adventurous foodie friends).  I should state now that the owners are the former owners of the Gourmet House of Hong Kong -- so I'm sure most of the food here is done in the Hong Kong style. (But I don't know much about Chinese regional cooking).  The other night we decided to check the place out for dinner. I am glad we did.  We ordered chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, pepper beef, orange chicken and a chicken rice bowl for the kiddo.  The service was spectacular -- our waitress (one of the owners) brought crackers for our daughter to eat (after dinner we went to the Asian supermarket across the street and bought a box of the crackers) and was otherwise wonderful with us. Some of the best service I've had in a very long time.  Physically, the place is bland. It's not home-y, but it does remind me of hole-in-the-wall faster food places abroad.  The food, on the other hand, is fantastic. Like I said, my food companions are not very adventuresome (chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken). I tried the pepper beef on suggestion by our waitress.  Every single person (including the three-year old) was blown away by the taste of the food. I really can't say much more.  It's very convenient to the Sycamore/Main Light Rail Station -- this should be on every foodie/light-rail rider's menu.

The other night I was looking for a quiet place to work on a project that had free wi-fi, so I decided to try out Solo.  Entering the cafe, I knew that this was a place that I will have to return. I ordered an espresso and a Cafe au lait, both were excellent. The espresso sweet and creamy and the cafe au lait perfect to relax with.  There were a few people there, working, and the owner was chatting and putting away books. A very nice guy it seems.  The decor of the shop is also well done, from the bicycle hanging from the wall to the post-modern lamp arching across the Victorian sofa. Lots of plugs for your laptop and fast wi-fi.  They have a record player with headphones and an LP collection so you can just zone out to the music if you'd like. They also have a DVD collection and a medium sized flat screen to watch a movie on, if you'd so like. I glanced at the collection, and seeing Steve Zissou, decided it was quite adequate.  They also boast a small collection of books on a borrow/take/donate system. Pretty rad.  I am definitely returning. I'm glad to find a nice coffee shop that's not in Central Phoenix.

Right on Main in downtown Mesa, Queen's is looking to become a fixture of downtown Mesa. The owner is gregarious and fun to talk to, and the food is quite good.  We ordered the Pizza, Wings and Cheese Bread.  Cheese Bread: Wow; fantastic! Cheesy, garlic-y, everything I wanted in a cheese bread but never knew I needed. If this is what Dave bakes in the bread department, the sandwiches are SURE to be AMAZING.  Wings: Some of the best in Phoenix, I'd gather. Definitely up there with Monkey Pants or Buffalo Brown's. Crispy fried things. Meaty. Delicious sauce, not too spicy, not too mild.  Pizza: GREAT toppings and quality. The sauce is fantastic. Unfortunately the crust leaves a lot to be desired. It's a pretty standard crust. Not exemplary at all, which is surprising given the quality of the bread on the cheesy bread. I know he uses an electric oven, which might mean he can't get the heat needed for a great pizza crust. Again though, the quality of the toppings and sauce makes up for the crust.  Definitely going to have it again, especially if they are able to get a beer/wine license or are able to start up those chess tournaments he mentioned.

I've been back a few times the past few months. Their pizza is better than before -- GREAT STUFF!  I had their meatball sandwich -- it is to die for. Big, meaty meat-balls in their fantastic marinara, covered with cheese and then thrown in the oven to melt into a delicious gooey sandwich of awesome.  I've taken my coworker twice now -- the pizza by the slice is fantastic. It's really, really, really good. Yum.  Thursday, we were shopping at Mystic Paper next door and decided to get dinner there, rather than cooking at home. The three of us shared two 10" pizzas and an order of garlic-cheese bread. Absolutely delicious.  They are now hosting poetry slams every Thursday night at 8pm. I haven't made it yet, but it's really exciting that something's happening Downtown Mesa after 5pm.

Such a great store -- and such a great find! Definitely one of the best stores in the valley. Found a number of great little gifts that were cheap stocking-stuffers for our little-ones -- as well as some great shirts and prints that were great gifts for friends. The store mainly focuses on collectible vinyl toys (great selection), but also has a cute variety of shirts, books, prints and other tchotchkes that make for great gifts and collectible items.  The gallery in the back has a consistently-worthwhile shows, and a number of affordable options for your own art collection.

Meagre selection. Terrible service. Never again.  I've been a few times and have never received stellar or knowledgeable help (about what I expect from Home Depot), but they're fairly close to my house and have a larger selection of potted plants than the big boxes.  This last time I went I asked for assistance from two separate associates to try and find seeds and was blown off rudely by both of them. They just shrugged, told me the seeds were in alphabetical order and walked away. I pointed out to one of the associates that the seeds weren't even close to being alphabetical, he tried to argue, pointed at the seeds, then shrugged and said "well, that's as good as it can be" and walked away. Neither associate knew if they had the seeds, nor did they know where they would be. Both were surly and rude.
