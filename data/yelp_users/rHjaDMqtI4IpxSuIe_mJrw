Went here this morning not really craving breakfast. Ordered a Philly Cheesesteak Stacker with Onion Rings. 5 minutes later the waiter comes back to tell me they are out of onion rings. I told him fries was ok. He brings the order and I ask for a side of ranch dressing. He tells me they are out of ranch dressing. And they proceeds to say "they" are doing them bad this week.  My question is how can you be out of something predominant on your lunch menu and then be out of something as simple as a dressing. Their manager can't run to Costco to load up until "they" eventually deliver the order?  Seems like every time we have been here they are out of aomething. So sadml.

To start out we had egg rolls. The sauce complimented the rolls real well. Not your typical sweet and sour but spicy. The pan fried pork dumplings are delicious. The Mongolian beef packs a punch. It is spicy but very flavorfull. Also had the house plate. If you like shrimp and scallops, this is the one for you! The service is great too. All in all a definite place to keep coming back to.

Our first time here. Tim ordered a Sacks' Jazz and I ordered the Sacks' Overture. The price was good for the food we got. Tim was excited the sanwiches came with a cookie.   The Overture was tasty, filling, and just enough horseradish sauce to my my sinuses flate. The food was fresh and good.  Tim says his Jazz is real good. He kept talking it uo.  The service we was friendly and quick.  For the price and quality of the food I would recommend it for your deli needs.

The customer service is poor. Went there for breakfast and the "specials" can't be ordered because they aren't ready. Then to top it off, was charged $4.22 for 1 cup of coffee and 1 glass of tea. The food consistency is non existent. Recommend any other cafe over this one. Believe in giving any place a second chance, this was their third. Not going back.

This was our first time trying Zoe's and we will definitely be going back. I ordered the Greek Chicken Marinara which came wirh a side salad as big as the meal and my partner ordered the Steak kabobs. Both dinners were very flavorful and well worth the money. The portion sizes were big.   Since we hadn't been there before and didn't realize how big the meals were we ordered the Hummus Trio. I loved that they served it with soft Pita, crispy pita, tomatoes, cucumbers, and green pepper. It really made the flavors of the three pop.  Lindsay was the host/server and we cannot say enough about how nice and attentive she was. She made sure everyone in the place was enjoying their experience there.

I just have a question for this restaurant. How can a place that deals in sushi and white rice dishes be out of both sushi and white rice? What a disappointment!

What happened to this place? It use to be value for your dollar. They have cut down on food served but the prices stayed the same. The food quality seems to be slipping also. Such a shame since it use to be our go to place for enchiladas.

This is a great place for breakfast. The food isngreat, the staff is great, and the ambiance is very nice. I had the Chiiquiles Benedict which was real good. My dining companion had Jan's Breakfast Tacos and he enjoyed them. One thing to make sure of, if you don't like waiting, is to get here before 8am.

This was the second time we went there. Had a less than impressive visit the first time but we figured with it being opening weekend we would give them a break.  This time the service was just as bad. Upon placing the order for some combos we were told they didn't have drinks. How can a fast food place not have drinks? Then we waited in line for almost 10 minutes waiting to get served by a rude girl who seemed more interested in what was going on inside rather than dealing with customers.  The food is mediocre and the large fries are a joke. Don't waste your extra money.   It is a shame this place is ran so badly. We were hoping it would be like other Rallys we have been to. Looks like we won't be going back now.

The wait staff is right on point, pleasant and attentive. The food was great. The special was a little pricey but definitely filling and tasty.

Our first time here and we will definitely be back. I had the Pampered Pig Sandwich with potatoes salad. The sandwich was piled high with Briskwt, Pulled Pork, pulled Chicken, and hotlinks. It was huge! Tim had Brisket Sliders and Fries. On th recommendation of other reviews we ordered Mac n Cheese too. All the food was great tasting and worth the price.  If you leave here hungry, it's your own fault!!

Had the Magic Shrooms burger with Green Chile Queso with Fries while Tim had the Bacon Cheeseburger. My burger rocked; delicious; juicy; and very flavorful. Tim wasn't as impressed with his. He said the meat wasn't very flavorful. The Green Chili Queso Fries are awesome. Definitely recommend getting those if you go. And since we went during Happy Hour the price was just right.

Seth was a great waiter. Was always there without being intrusive. The food was great. A little pricey, but as my partner said "You pay for the environment". Definitely a nice place to share a great dinner.
