These guys are the best carpet cleaning service I've used yet. On time, very efficient, with the right amount of humor to go with a very professional attitude! They had corner protectors so that my wall corners and staircase banister corners didn't get dinged or scratched which was a first for me, no one previous to them had ever used them so the marks on my corners were from odious cleaners. From here on out these are my guys I will use!

Where do I start... Instantly when I walked through the doors I noticed the floor was horribly dirty. When me and my wife sat down at the sushi bar I noticed a piece of sushi on the floor and it appeared to have been there a while. The table was extremely sticky. The air ducts were really dirty. The ac was not on or was broke I'm not to sure but it was 118 degrees outside and I can't imagine that it was good to have sushi out in this climate. Next our waitress was talking to friends while we were waiting for drinks. After we finally got our drinks the sushi came. The avocado was black, little highlights of green but for the most part black. All the sushi was hot no sign of it ever being cold. Worst sushi experience ever in my life..... Needless to say RA is dead to me I will never go to another RA ever again.....

I've been a motocross racer since I was 14. I started seeing Dr. Turley when I was 19 and have been back in every time I need an adjustment since, I am currently 32. One of my friends referred me to Kevin since we put our body's through such a hard pace racing and the only reason I went to Dr. Turley  was because the man works on all kinds of athletes and football players. Who better right! I can't imagine where I would be without a guy that knows how to get me back to good as fast as he does.

Ok I give the park 3 stars but 1 star for the surf hour it's a bummer because of the locals that go there.  The guy that runs the surf shop is a d-bag. Me and my buddy were sharing my board so I would wait in line till there session was done and then he would bring the board to me and vice versa. So I waited in line my buddy brings my board to me and mr surf shop says I need to go to the back of the line if I'm sharing a board and wait.... I just waited I told him and I'm not going to the back of the line, he said its a rule. I asked who's rule? He said its an unspoken rule the regulars made.... Kiss my.... I just waited and you want me to wait again just cause I'm sharing a board what kind of bs is that I paid money to ride just like everyone else. If you want to have fun don't surf here, not worth the wait or the bs or the 3 second ride  or the money....... I'd also like to add I bought a boat to wake surf behind so I wouldn't have to deal with all the a-holes that can't afford to do the same!!! Middle finger bro!!

This place is way better than filibertos, the carne asada is amazing. Try the California burrito, I've never had a burrito taste so good! I'll be a regular now for sure!!

If your looking for a fun bar, don't go here.... If you picture a bar with good music and everyone laughing then this is not the place to go... We went in ready to have a good time but between the 60's- 80's mix and the sleepy atmosphere we were ready to go have some actual fun... If your 60-80yrs old this is your place, if your young and want fun this is not even an option.... I'm sitting here now and it's Saturday night and 11:00pm and I'm ready to go to sleep in a booth at the bar.....

John sold me a transmission with a year warranty and it broke and he told me I broke it so it wasn't under warranty..... What the hell is a warranty for exactly?? If it breaks it's fixed by the shop.. I had to haggle for a day just to get him to cover half the cost.. Beware a warranty at the mustang shop is not a warranty. Oh yea and he sold me a 5.0 engine that had the lowest compression that I've ever seen and almost didn't take it back. 40psi was the highest measurement I got on cylinder 2.if you want good mustang parts go else ware!

Talk about a company that will go beyond what you would ever expect... Customer service that is next to none, and probably the best vehicle repair out of anyone in the valley. Having been to the big name company's due to a wife that seems to be a magnet for bad drivers I have finally found the shop I will go to for repairs for the rest of my life!!!! Don't go anywhere else what you need and want for repairs and paint are right here!!!!

Horrible company, don't waste your time. Amateur employees and management that doesn't know how to schedule.... Glenn the GM is a joke to talk to.... Worst investment I have ever made... Oh and all the good comments are from people that work there.. Not one good comment is from an actual customer.... Seriously

Great place with awesome prices and friendly knowledgable staff! Ammo is priced better than anyone and they actually have ammo..... If your using some other place then switch cause your getting ripped off in many ways like customer service, price point and ammo selection!! It's truly a one stop shop!!! Do it!!

Absolutely amazing!! I'm watching my little one play from my phone! They have a camera in every room so I can constantly watch my child. The staff is amazing, the food is healthy, and there is no doubt in my mind that she is being well cared for at all times cause I can see her anytime I want!!!!! Personally I can't imagine sending my kid somewhere that I have no idea if she is being taken care of and all the other thoughts that come to mind, but here peace of mind is at its highest 100% of the time!
