What's wrong with this customer service model:    Sofa on sale today only for 20% off - but out of stock - 7 weeks minimum to delivery - but won't sell the floor model because, "We'd have nothing to show customers."    Huh??   They don't have anything for customers to buy!

Great massage yesterday from Andrea. It was my third massage with her - was having difficulty with temperature (mine, not the room) and she graciously offered to "turn on the bed."  I immediately felt warmer and then had to ask her to turn it off.  I didn't  want to be demanding but Andrea was very accommodating and she even remembered to cover me up quickly so I did not get chilled.  I have highly recommended Andrea to others and they are equally pleased.
