This place was recommended to me from a co-worker. Most of the company now brings their car's here. These guys are great, very helpful and knowledgeable. I have been back a few times and can say I really trust this shop.

Yelp Says they are 43rd and Happy Valley. i called for delivery they answered the phone and put me on hold for about 5 mins. when they came back on the phone they said thank for calling Pizza Mia on 43rd and Bethany. I told her their Yelp account said they were on Happy Valley and 43rd, she responded "well were not". I said ok you may want to update your Yelp account and she hung up with out saying a word.   I guess they are just to busy to be polite.

This is a go to lunch spot for my coworkers and I. Recently it has taken a while to get our food, but if you dont get here by 1130am during the week this place fills up very quickly.   The chips and salsa are a must!   I usually get the chicken taco's but we have ordered a lot of different dishes off this menu and we never had something we didn't like.

Bad food. Bad service.   My Brother and buddy went to Half Moon to watch Monday Night Football. We arrived right around the end of the 1st quarter and the place wasn't all that busy.   All of our rounds were ordered within the Happy Hour time frame, i even looked at the time when we ordered out last round at 650pm. That round of beers didn't get to us until 710pm and my buddy joked i bet these get charged full price. and when the bill came he was right.   My brother and I ordered wings when we first got there which took 30min to show up. When they finally did come we ordered 2 hamburgers and my buddy ordered wings. 40 min later my burger showed up completely wrong. wings and the other burger no where. When the waitress came over she was shocked the other food hadn't come out. when the other items did come out there were cold. All the food except for the wings was terrible very greasy.  The place has some nice TV's but one of the TV's is constantly running an awful and tacky slide show of photos from the bar and random specials.   We wont be going back and wouldn't recommend to anyone going to this bar.

The food is pretty good but we have gone in 3-4 times (because it is the only Chinese food in the area) and the service has been awful every time.  We tried to call in an order and it still took them an extra 20 min then they said it would take to get our food.   This last time they only had one server working. I felt really bad for the guy.

We've been here twice now, and both times have been great! The service and food are both top notch.  I got the bone in ribeye my wife got the New York strip, both were cooked perfectly. The sides and sauce options are all very good. A little pricey but expected in Cave Creek, well worth the drive.

Awful service the hostess was very rude and the prices are ridiculous for the quality of food. I would rather go to Streets of New York or Buffalo Wild wings.

Just tried Noodle and Rice for lunch. I got the Teriyaki & Vegetables w/ chicken lunch special. The food was really good, the vegetables were crispy and seemed fresh, and you can't beat their prices.    My only complaint was that it took about 20min to get my food to go, but that is an easy fix to simply call ahead next time.   Will definitely be going again.

Really great place to eat and drink. we have been in 4-5 times since they have opened.  Service was a little spotty the first time we were in but it has improved every time we go back.

Best BBQ I have had in Phoenix! I have been many times and have yet to have a bad experience. Everything on the menu is good, the sides are amazing and I can get enough of the BBQ sauces they have.

Great Pizza. Can't say much else, I drove by one night last week and stopped to pick up a pizza for dinner. The crust was great, so was the sauce. This has become our new favorite pizza place.

Great food!   Best Thai food I have found on the west side.   My wife and I picked up food for us and friends that just had a baby. We got a bunch of appetizers and main courses to try, all were great.   Can't wait to go back.

We came here in a large group for a friends birthday.   I understand on a Friday night, in a large group service won't be the best, but this was just bad. The server we had was very nice and seemed to be running a lot but there seemed to be a lot of wait staff just standing around.   After asking different servers over 5 times for napkins and silverware over the course of 30min i went inside to get some. I also asked about a friends meal that hadn't yet arrived. They order over 40min before and were last to their meal, a chicken wrap. When i asked why the guy i spoke to said well its Friday night.  The bar was half empty there was another large party but other than that it was fairly empty.   The food was ok, the beer was fine. But I wouldn't recommend and won't be going back.

Went here for lunch around 1130am on a Saturday. There were 4 adults and 3 kids 3years - 6 years old.  We had never been here before saw it as we were driving by and decided to give it a shot. Its not in the best strip, but the inside is nice and clean.  We order: 2 burrito's plates one w/ Green Chicken one w/ Green Pork 2 #3's one with cheese one with Grilled Chicken 2 kids cheese quesadillas  1 kids bean burrito  All the food was GREAT! the green pork (pork with green chillies) and the Green chicken was amazing. The kids ate all their food with no complaints. The prices were pretty good for all the food we had.   They have refried, pinto and Black beans all were very good. the Gauc was good and only 75 cents extra not a dollar something.   Will definitely be back to try the tacos, and the rest of the menu. Very good Mexican food!

This place is GREAT!!!  SO excited for Spiga to open in place of the awful restaurant that was here before. It is gorgeous on the inside. We love the see thru all glass wine cellar.   I got the Risotto Tutto Mare, and it was very good. we got a few appetizers and it was all good.   They had a great wine list, the wine seemed a little pricey, but nothing crazy.   We will definitely be coming back here.

Gio's is GREAT! We have been here a few times and had a couple different slices of their pizza. Their Lasagna pizza is amazing! We usually take out the Sausage and Pepperoni pizza. Its about a 20ish min drive one way for us to get the pizza but it is worth it.   I have seen some people say this pizza is good for Anthem, but I have to disagree, the pizza and the service is great any where.

Finally a U of A bar in Phoenix!! Great location.  Good food. We had the pretzel board. The carne Assad tacos. The green chili pork. The surf and turf. And it was all very good.  Great patio! We had 6 kids ranging from 6 weeks to 5 years and they all had a blast.
