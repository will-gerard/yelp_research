The food is ehh. Only good when drunk really. My main issue is that the night crew, especially Friday and Saturday night, are the greediest people ever. Their card reader almost always conveniently goes down. Given the fact that I live right next to it, I often attempt to stop after a night of drinking with hopes that things will be different. No luck. They take an hour to make a burrito, and that's if I have cash on me. They pocket the money, it's a common practice, but I've never seen it done so often. Ask for a receipt, I guarantee they can't provide one.

Love Venezia's, especially this location. All the workers are so kind and helpful. They seem to make it a priority to remember you by name. The pizza is great...and big. The lunch specials are such a great price!
