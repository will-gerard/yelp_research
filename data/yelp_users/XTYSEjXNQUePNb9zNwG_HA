This is an amazing restaurant with amazing staff and even better food! I have yet to find another place that has such tender and moist meats and vast choices. If you're in the mood for delicious and tasty Mexican food, this is your place.

They destroy my drink 8/10 times and their baristas are quite rude. For one of the busiest Starbucks in Scottsdale, they lack quite a bit. I stopped coming to this Starbucks. I now go to the other one inside the store off the freeway.

George and his staff were classy, accommodating and down to earth. The restaurant itself is romantic and quiet. Everything about this restaurant is EXACTLY what an intimate or family dinner should be like. George goes to each table to ensure 110% satisfaction and the food is exquisite! I HIGHLY recommend this place for romantic dinners or even any event! We will be back each and everytime we want to eat out! FINALLY a restaurant worth talking about!

I went to Fredricks and 2 Fascination stores... Both made me cry. I'm a size 44 F... All I wanted was a corset that would enhance my natural curves and beauty. Rachel and the staff not only shopped with me but also allowed me to feel 110% happy and confident with myself. I was EXTREMELY pleased with the services I received and would recommend this superstore filled with super people ANYDAY! If you're looking for personalized, down to earth and reasonable lingerie and staff... look no further! Their lines of different styles, their phenomenal selection of boots and shoes and their staff that make you feel welcomed and like your best friend is all right here. I fell in love tonight. I'm breaking up with Fredricks of Hollywood and will forever be faithful to Lingerie Superstore!

They've improved their customer service over time. I rather enjoy this specific location and have seen the less reputable baristas as they destroyed my order and either improved or are no longer there....

Beautiful park with amazing ambiance! Very clean and very classy. The shops nearby are professional and down to earth. Taking the afternoon to enjoy the ducks and the fountain is magical!

WARNING **THEY ARE PRIVATELY OWNED NOT BY TOKYO EXPRESS** have come to this location for YEARS! I have always been very pleased with the food and the service. This time, it was HORRIBLE. The Manager Jung, was extremely rude and not at all helpful. This place changed ownership a few months ago which means smaller portions for more money. Sue was the ONLY saving grace of this place. I will not return to location as well, I will advise friends and family to do the same. The regular bowl for Teryaki Chicken used to fill me up with left overs for approximately $8.10. Now the "plate" is 10.00. Imagine only 6 medium sized strips of chicken with 2 huge scoops of rice. Fill half of the plate with the salad and thousand island dressing and the other "half" with rice and chicken. The food quality tasted the same but amounts were different. I requested why this change took place and the manager Jung said "Eastwind has ALWAYS served on plated with half salad and have ALWAYS charged $10.00" Not only was I upset about the amount of food for the price, I was now extremely upset at the tone and way Jung spoke to my family and me. I do not recommend this location any longer but should you go... Ask for Sue. She is a sweetheart older woman that ordered me another bowl to say sorry for the way her family member Jung treated my family during this visit. We came from Anthem and feel this just is not worth the drive any longer. Steer clear folks if you were a regular at some point... not at all the same.
