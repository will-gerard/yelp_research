Definitely make a reseveration, even if you think a reservation is not necessary.  Bedillion's is regularly at capacity during peak season, especially for dinner, even midweek. Indoor seating within the historic residence building, or outdoor seating, weather permitting, dining at their garden patio... nice experience. Afterwards, browse the on-site museum to see fascinating antiques and some archaeological pieces from past centuries.  Bedillion's has a really handsome bar with original woodwork from the early 1900s. Space at the bar is limited, but with enough advance notice, you could stop by Bedillions just for a few good drinks at their bar, then go check out the museum and cactus garden.  For a light entree, try the cedar plank grilled salmon. Or for something more southwest hearty, try their prime rib, it is outstanding... fresh, hand cut, thick and tender. The prime rib supply can sell out fast, so make a reservation and place your order in advance!  Bedillion's is located in an older residential section of Casa Grande. But don't be fooled by older outward appearances, Bedillion's is a well kept little secret in Casa Grande that you must experience to appreciate. After you visit Bedillion's, you'll be telling all your friends about your amazing find off the beaten path in Casa Grande.  The staff is a lot of fun. If you're lucky enough to meet Michael, the owner of Bedillion's, talk with him, Michael will make your visit memorable. Michael is a wealth of information about anything you see at Bedillion's, from the cacti, to the museum pieces, to the menu items. Be courteous with Michael and the Bedillion's staff... and they'll be nice to you.  If you're going to be passing through the area, call ahead and make a reservation at Bedillion's. Their menu and contact info is at the Bedillion's website:  www bedillons com

Peach Festival 2012: Do not expect big plump peaches. The variety grown at this farm are small desert peaches. As of mid-May 2012, the majority of peaches were not yet tree ripened. If you hand pick, take time to search the orchard and find a tree with good fruit.  Footwear recommendation... if you do the UPICK, wear something you don't care gets dirty... the peach orchard ground is unlevel dirt and patches of mud, so wearing nice footwear or flip flops is not recommended.  The peach pancake breakfast served on-site was generous with the pancakes, but stingy on the peach topping. The peaches used in the topping were unripe, somewhat crunchy, and required a sprinkling of sugar. Expect to stand in a long slow line for your serving.  Free admission and parking, but higher prices for many of the peach related products and other items sold at this festival.

Very popular sushi bar in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Good sushi for Arizona. I had to send a happy hour alcoholic beverage back to the bar for some fixing. Weekend evenings are very busy, can be loud inside and nearby parking space is usually difficult to find, so if possible, car pool.

Best Mexican food in Phoenix. Serving authentic menu items for years, always with a complimentary assortment of fresh salsas.  They have six locations in Arizona. I have been to 5 of the 6, all very good, but I prefer the quality of the location on Peoria Ave in Phoenix and the Ina Road location in Tucson. But all of their locations serve really good Mexican food.

Better quality sushi than the franchised sushi bars. Toyama is owned an operated by a very nice man from Japan that looks like he is 19 but he older and educated in the sushi business. It was more expensive than I prefer, but it is located in North Scottsdale were things cost more.

A Touch of European Cafe is a well kept little secret of Glendale Arizona. If you enjoy Eastern European fare, or just want to try something new, visit this small, picturesque cafe, which is located on a charming and quiet side street within the historic square of Glendale. Weather permitting, dine at the outdoor patio under mature shade trees, where you may feel as if you are no longer in the desert Southwest. This is a place where you can casually relax with some quality authentic food in a quaint, possibly romantic setting. Tip: Call ahead about their Sour Pickle Soup... you do not have to be pregnant to develop cravings for this unusual yet appetizing soup recipe!

Cerreta is the Wonka of Arizona. Family owned candy production for over 40 years, they know candy making, and they do it well. Cerreta is also very involved with charitable causes in the community.  Take your friends and family on a guided tour of the factory. Kids love it. The size of the factory is modest, so a tour does not involve extensive walking or much time. Call ahead to confirm that the factory will be in candy production during your visit.  The Cerreta factory shop offers an assortment of chocolates and other candies that make excellent gifts for any occasion.

Live bull riding night, bbq galore, indoor and outdoor bar. View of rodeo action can be crowded. At the front door an open barrel of salted peanuts in the shell. You can even toss the peanut shells on the floor.

Good breakfast. Be prepared for a wait list. Also limited parking, so you may need some coin for a parking meter down the street. Very small interior, don't bring a group. Gotta try Matt's Big Breakfast at least once.

Good Thai cuisine owned and operated by a local Thai family. Typical Thai menu. Portion size seems to be getting a little smaller and unfortunately they removed the non-fried items from their $4.99 lunch specials. If you want authentic Thai for an average price and you happen to be in or driving by Anthem Arizona, Dara Thai is a good selection.

Good sushi. Not the best I have experienced, but some of the better sushi for Arizona. They also offer a variety of Japanese soups and entrees. Very Asian decor. The place is located in a strip mall. Nice variety of selections on the menu. Long wait list to be seated on weekend nights. And when the place is busy, also expect a short wait to use the restrooms, which are located in a confined area.

Excellent BBQ. Fair portions, but don't expect anything Texas huge. Orders are made and served at the counter. Not crazy about the side dishes. Nice setting in Cave Creek. Limited parking. Check for their closed days before you drive out to Bryan's.

100 reviews for Sonora Mesquite Grill!  I am a fan. Do not expect much ambiance, but do try an assortment of the soft tacos and authentic salsas with their family recipe horchata beverage!  One disappointment, they did not use real shredded cheese on the nachos, they used something similar to a velveeta/cheese whiz.

Romantic bistro. Small but cozy interior. Nice garden patio. Delicious French cuisine, some of the very best you will find in Arizona. If you know something about French cuisine you will probably like this place. If you are unfamiliar with French cuisine this is a good place to experience French tastes. Professional mixer at the bar, Chad. The dinner appetizers were our favorite. I was not impressed with the complimentary table bread served with the entree and I did experience what seemed to be food-borne illness a few hours after dining at Petite Maison. My companion did not experience any symptoms so I'm not sure what could have caused the illness. But all the items we ordered from the dinner menu were very good and I would dine there again in a heartbeat.

Quality bagels made in-house. Located on Carefree Highway just east of I-17, Hot Bagels is good place to stop for a quick breakfast or lunch when traveling either way on I-17.

Probably the best overall dinner buffet in the Phoenix area. New, spacious, clean with attentive table service. Even a nice covered outdoor patio with candles, heat lamps and a view. If you are going to spend $25 for buffet, spend it at Wandering Horse Buffet. Ask for directions to the Buffet entrance, it's easy to miss.

Visited twice. Not a big fan of Ketzal on either visit. Small portions, mediocre quality. Not impressed with the salsas which are more like salad dressings. They got me into the restaurant for a second visit with a coupon, then refused to honor the coupon. There is much better authentic Mexican in town. I'd prefer a Rubio's before Ketzal.

Disappointing comedy theater. Unless you absolutely must see a certain comedian act, save your money. In addition to the cost of tickets, or even if you get free tickets, you will have to pay for an overpriced two drink minimum, per person, inside the theater. Mediocre drinks. Poor quality food. Substandard table service. Opening acts were boring. On high profile nights, you may have to wait in an endless line that wraps around the building along the sidewalk then up a few flights of stairs.  But, high marks to the venue next door, Copper Blues! Great place to chill. Over 50 beers on tap, full bar, live music stage, celebrity chef kitchen, professional staff. (4 stars on Yelp)

Copper Blues is still the best place in Phoenix for draft brews. Cooper Blues is better than the Yard House. Copper Blues offers better value, has live music or other entertainment most nights, and it is conveniently located near all the hot spots and attractions downtown.
