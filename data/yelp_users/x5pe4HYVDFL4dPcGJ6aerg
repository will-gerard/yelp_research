Boston roll was pretty good, but the Teppanyaki was great. Brendan was our table chef. He made an excellent meal and entertained the entire table. We'll definitely go back.

Went there for my neices graduation last week. There were twelve of us and everyone had something different. The chicken fajitas were great and I heard no complaints from anyone. The sangria and margaritas went down pretty easy as well.

Gave me a good deal on service I had done.....about 30% cheaper than any other service shop.

Pretty darn good cheese steak. The bread was really good and the meat had no grizzle. Took about 15-20 mins to get our sandwiches, but it was worth the wait.

*************WARNING***************************** Don't use these fools!!!!  We took my son's Karate Gi (Uniform) into Carousel a couple weeks ago. We wanted patches removed from the old Gi and put on a new one. After a few days we picked the Gi up and brought it home. We noticed what appeared to be green chalk or highlighter all around the patches. Also found one patch didn't get sewn in a three inch spot. Totally unprofessional job.  We were furious as our son now had to wear this Gi to practice. My wife called several time attempting to get in contact with the manager. She was finally able to speak with the manager and her reply was " You should have had it cleaned". NOONE told us there would be green chalk or highlighter marks all over a  WHITE Gi!!!   Unfortunatly we paid in cash or I would have disputed with my CC company.

Been there twice so far. First time was good but second visit was pretty bad. Waited at the door for 5 minutes then decided to seat myself. Asked for more dip and chips three times before we got more. Asked for no peppers on the fajitas but yes on the onions. Sizzling plate came out with nothing but a bunch of dried up burnt chicken. Tamales and the wifes salad were good.

Love Chompies. Takes me back ten years to life on the east coast. The Pastrami and Chicken noodle soup combo was outstanding this last visit.

Journeyed to Glendale to see the lights earlier this week. Decided to try this place and see what the fuss is all about. They opened at 5 so we waited out front until they opened. I am sure glad we did as the line grew and went down the block.   Well the service was great. Fried Calamari and pizza was really good. The chicken marsala was a bit salty for me, but was decent anyway. The wife had had a chicken and pasta dish which she enjoyed. My mother inlaw(Italian from jersey) actually loved the linguini and clam sauce.   Bottom line is great pizza and outstanding service by Michelle.

This place is hit and miss. The food and service were great the first few times we went. Past two experiences have been annoying to say the least. When you order a rare steak you don't expect to get it well /md well done. Not sure if we will go back, but if so I hope it better than our last experience.

Lived in NY and NJ for ten years and this is authentic Italian.  Owner/chef is always in the dining room making sure you are  enjoying the food. The deserts are Unreal!

Great Pizza and Garlic Knots. Definitely compares to the pizza I used to get in Bay Ridge Brooklyn. The sandwiches are great as well. Some places in the area claim to use Boars Head meat and don't. These guys do and it makes the sub outstanding! We need to try rest of the menu, but so far I'm very pleased.

35 minute wait with lots of open tables. Seriously, there were 5 open tables in the same area they seated us. Good burger. Wifes steak was a pretty bad cut of meat. She loves their sweet potatoes though.

Good chicken sandwich and burgers.......but I will never wait an hour for lunch again. I would understand if the place was packed, but four tables were seated when we arrived. Again, good food but expect a long wait.

Worst managed restaurant EVER!!!! Doesn't matter when you arrive there is always a wait. I would understand if a restaurrant is crowded but this happens ever time we go to this location. When you wait twenty-thirty minutes and 30% of the tables are empty that is just POOR MANAGEMENT. Busy hours rarely change, so staff yourself better instead of inconveniencing your customers. Love the food but absolutely refuse to go back to this location.

The food was good, but seriously.....$21.95 for a 6 oz chicken dish. No kids menu. Three servers for a thirty person party and a half full dining room. The original tutti's was much better

Yeah....I'd go back for seconds! Had the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and was very happy! Kids loved the pizza.

Only reason I give a 2 is because they are all pretty nice people. However, I expect all the dirt and bugs off the front end. I also expect the rims to be cleaned. I never leave there with out having them wipe down the vehicle again. Don't get me wrong, I'm not that picky....they are just that BAD.

The wet brisket was great as was the pulled pork. The chicken was excellent. But.....I went there for the ribs and I was a little disappointed. Gotta get the potatoe salad and cream corn sides.

Seriously nice waiter. The beans and slaw were good. The cuban sandwich had burnt cheese, no pickles or mustard and the bun was crumbling apart. Their slogan is the evolution of barbecue.......I sure hope not!!!! Won't be back.

My wife heard this place was fantastic on the news. I really hope this is not the best Chicago has to offer.  We ordered an Italian beef sandwich, a Tomboli and a thin crust cheese pizza. About 5 mins after we ordered, we were told there was no more Italian beef. Its Friday night.....why don't they have a full menu? I changed my order to a Chicken Parm sandwich.  The Chicken parm had about two oz of breaded chicken and the sausage in the Tomboli was way under cooked. The pizza wasnt bad, but nowhere near as good as Sals or Casanovas.  Pretty bad experience and probably because there was no leadership there what so ever. All kids and one older man that just looked confused were working.  Worst $47 meal in a long time!
