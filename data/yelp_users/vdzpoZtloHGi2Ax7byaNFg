The girls on the sales floor are awesome! Very friendly and helpful. I would give this location 5 stars if it weren't for my experience with the women in alterations.  DO NOT USE THEIR ALTERATIONS DEPARTMENT!!! Those women are extremely extremely rude, accusing, and all around unpleasant.

Please teach your cashiers proper bagging of groceries!! This was the forth time ive gone and had raw meat put in the same bag as fresh produce, cheese, bread, etc.

Went to Long John Silvers today for lunch. We dont live in this area and we dont have a location near us. I was very excited to see one! Unfortunately, everything we ordered was disgusting! (i didnt get a chance to try the clams since i ordered and paid for them but did not receive them) the fish wasnt even crispy, the breading was completely soggy and you couldnt pick it up to take a bite without it falling to soggy pieces. The shrimp was completely over-breaded. It was like taking a bite of flavorless breading and hardly any shrimp. The french fries were cold and soggy, on the onion rings were fried in the fish oil...that did not taste good! I will never go to a long john silvers again. They've gone way downhill and its no wonder they're all closing down. Gross!

Never disappointed when we go here. My husband and i always order the special, without asking what it is, because its always a delicious surprise. The most unique, and best, burgers around.
