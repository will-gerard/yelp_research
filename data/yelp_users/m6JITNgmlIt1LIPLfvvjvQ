Our experience here today buying our Christmas tree was 5Star. We also looked at some new trees for our yard. The entire staff went above and beyond to make it pleasurable. We will definitely be back to this nursery!!

I have gone to Ariels a couple times and had great experiences both times. He repaired a couple expensive heels and a purse for me and did a wonderful job both times. He's very friendly and does quick work if you're in a pinch too. I definitely recommend him and I will be going back.

Very disappointed in my experience here today. I was excited to try a new place as I just moved to the area. The nail tech that did my pedicure was not enjoyable at all. She was rushed to get to her next client and was consumed in her phone. She gave no attention to a massage and for a $55 pedicure that's what I expected and wanted. I thought she was very unprofessional and rude. She didn't cure my gel polish and when I reminded her she quickly ran over them but not good enough, I had to ask her to do it again before she rushed me out the door.  I have had better service at Asian shops of which I stopped going to for a reason.  I had the worst experience at this place and I will never go back and would not recommend this place to anyone.

Atmosphere, food, and location, this place has it all! If you are looking for a low key Mexican food restaurant in Scottsdale with excellent food this is your place!!! I will be frequenting this spot!!

These apartments are horrible, the only reason I gave 1 star is because of the location. I don't actually live here but my fianc√© does and I am here often.   First of all, the walls are paper thin and I can hear the neighbors conversations, closet door open, and television. If you're a light sleeper then this is not the place for you.   The parking is so bad and limited, I always have to park and walk a very far distance to the apartment.   The maintenance department or management is very unprofessional and doesn't seem to care about their residents. We reported a major crack and countertop lifting issue 6 months ago and they still haven't fixed it or asked about it. The garbage disposal has been broken for months and they don't seem to care either. It takes several attempts to get them to come and fix anything so we don't even bother.   The apartments are old and have cheap fixtures and flooring. I know that this is an upgrade but for a north Scottsdale apartment complex and the amount that is paid here is unacceptable.   I am so glad that we bought a house and I don't have to come to this apartment ever again.

Kevin is AWESOME!! He really knows how to take care of his clients and make the home selling process effortless for the seller.  He just sold my house in 3 days for above asking price. He handled everything for me and put my mind at ease.  I would recommend Kevin to anyone looking for a great real estate experience!!

I really like this place, the owners are very nice and they do a wonderful job on our clothes.  I have never had an issue and they have good prices!! They do the cleaning on premises as well.

I hate leaving bad reviews but I have to because this place has too many stars and it was terrible. I came here with a friend and we were both very disappointed with the quality and the freshness of the food. There was also a huge half dead roach in the bathroom on the floor, gross!!  I will never eat here again!!

I have used Boss Transportation for the past couple of years over 20 times. I have always had a great experience. They are always on time, friendly and their customer service is compared to none. I highly recommend this company to anyone.
