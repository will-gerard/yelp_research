Always great food and a fun place to go! I always order their garlic fries, they are delicious. I love the little fly exterminator guy they have walking around there.

Sat at the bar and the bartender blatantly ignored us. She made drinks literally right in front of us and didn't even look at us. She finally greeted us unenthusiastically and my friend ordered a beer. She didn't even ask me what I wanted. My friend drank her entire beer and the bartender never took my order. More guests sat at the bar and she ignored them too. My friend left a $5 on the bar for her beer and we walked out.

Everything about this experience was great from the service to the food and drinks. I ordered a Long Island ice tea and it was probably the best one I've ever had. Our server Rae greeted us promptly and showed us to the lunch specials, she did an awesome job. The manger delivered our food and was humorous, not the typical "how is everything" line you get at table touches. The food came out fast and was to die for. I got the almond crusted salmon and my friend got the garlic noodles with chicken. We both finished our plates and left very happy. Definitely will be coming back to this location.

This is defiantly a frequented spot for my friends and I, we have never had a bad experience here. We come a lot for the bottle and board special they have on Mondays and Tuesdays and there's usually a wait, but well worth it. I took my grandmother out for her birthday a few nights ago and it was her first time there, she absolutely loved it. Our server Nathan was just lovely, efficient and friendly and not just a robot taking an order. Kudos to you Postinos, keep up the great service!

This is a usual spot for my friends and I for the past few years. Service is known to be pretty slow, but we are patient people and still continue to return. Our server last night was great though, probably one of the best ones we have had there. Now I am not easily bothered, but what I saw occur last night did not sit right with me, especially being in management of a restaurant chain myself. We wanted to order some food, but we were told the kitchen was closed...no big deal. A group sat next to us about 20-30 mins after we noticed them ordering food(with a different server). We brushed it off thinking maybe they were going to be told the same thing. Then all of a sudden food is being delivered to them after we had been told otherwise. It was just incredibly rude and a huge slap in the face. I had asked our server what was going on and she told me that they "bribed" the kitchen and paid them to cook their food. What?! That's just unheard of and so unprofessional.

My friend and I had never been here before, so we decided to give it a try. The atmosphere was very fun and inviting and immediately our server Kayla approached us with a more than friendly greeting. Our service was phenomenal, Kayla was awesome. Food was great, prices were fair, and service was great. I would definitely recommend!

I've been here a few times now and it's always a pleasant experience. The blueberry margarita is a must try!   Great food, great drinks, and great service every time I've been here. This has become a new spot for my friends and I to frequent.
