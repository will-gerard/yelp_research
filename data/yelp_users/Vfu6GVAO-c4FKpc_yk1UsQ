Last night, I was in with a group for a goodbye to a European friend. Yes, groups can be tiresome for a server...But our server continually complained that it caused her extra work. In addition, while refilling my friend's water glass, the server stated, "Maybe I should get you an additional glass!" (Um, okay, your glasses are small and we live in the desert! Rude much?!) The food was okay, but not spectacular like the reviews stated. Perhaps the service tainted my taste buds.
