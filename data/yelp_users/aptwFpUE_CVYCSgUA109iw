I work for the Phoenix Fire Department and you will see me here almost every Saturday night. The coffee is exceptional and the customer service is alwyas nice. Its a nonpretentious douchebag place and the vibe is no corporate. Its a nice change of pace in my life and I enjoy it. You will also find me here now on random nights with my laptop watching a movie and enjoying a coffee as I am just so relaxed when I am here.  Great coffee, good atmosphere and a great addition to downtown,,

I chose Sante based on reviews here and other places. I will now do all I can to make sure the real reviews are given. This facility is nice, new, updated and clean. Now the care and communication is a nightmare. Grandma has been in the facility for 3 weeks. She has received 2 showers, case management has not spoken to us since check in,  all records are completely wrong, they shared patient information with a neighbor but won't give it to a daughter. They have notes on file that have nothing to do with our grandma and they have names associated with her that aren't names of any family members. We have escalated items up the chain and received great help, until the next day when it appears as if it all goes back to the original issues and communications goes to hell. You need to be an advocate for your family members when they are in the care of a facility but this place needs you to be an advocate day and night. I will not and can not recommend this facility to anyone.

The term urgent should not be used for this place. 45 minute wait for us with 1 person in front. I feel bad for the 12 behind us.

Went for dinner Monday night and had a blast. The food was exceptional and the ambiance was quite nice. Had to look around a few times to get a refill as the staff was congregating talking to each other instead of checking on the tables. Only about 12 covers when we were there and looked like 3 or 4 wait staff.  Ordered the sizzling shrimp, lemograss pho and pot stickers. It was damn good and I will return..

I have been coming here since Joe took over and the shop is great. The selection of cigars has been excellent but its the atmosphere that makes it. It doesn't matter your level of knowledge or smoking experience you will feel welcome here. The customer base is varied and you will be able to jump into a conversation anytime and feel like you are welcomed. Its a comfortable lounge with all the amenities you expect, the staff will go above and beyond to make you feel welcome.

Here I sit waiting almost an hour just to pee in a cup. This is my 2nd time here and both have been horrible. There is nothing fast or urgent about the care here. I would not come here excpt it's where I have to go for an employment drug screen. Find a good doctor and go visit him/her instead if you have the choice.   Hire more people or do something to make this quicker. This wait is ridiculous....
