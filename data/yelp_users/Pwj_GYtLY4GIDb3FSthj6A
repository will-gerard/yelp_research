I haven't gone into the actual location yet, but for my one cheat "sweet" from working out, my husband brought home cookies from here. After sampling the pineapple cookie, I wanted to forgo working out and just eat my weight in cookies. I had the chocolate chip cookie in the end (only bc it was larger and I only got one choice) but after sampling a few, this will be my go to spot!

I was just in this Walmart and they had all their thanksgiving dinner rolls that are "refrigerator only" stacked on shelves in front of the paper towel isle. I called and told them but they rushed me off the phone. I'm willing to bet they put those warm biscuits in a fridge and pretended they hadn't been out all week. And the cashier talked to another employee the whole time she checked me out while I was trying to get her attention to ask her something.

I've only been here once, but my only complaint was that my belly wasn't big enough for all of the food that I ordered. I had a sandwich, wine and a bruschetta board. Everything was good, but I'd say the bruschetta board is really the item to visit for. Different flavors and choices. Combinations that you aren't sure should work are delicious. So when I crave a girls night with the works, I intend to come here for wine and bruschetta boards!

I've been here a few times but this time I just realized that it's my last time. Either they've changed some flavor components or they've gotten lazy because things that I've had in the past (like the pork carnitas and the kale salad) that tasted fine were dry and bland. Maybe it was a bad night. But I only give a lower rating bc the last time I was here I thought similar things but thought it was an off night. I'm tired of paying higher prices for average food. My son also has a food allergy (fish) and they said they'd changed the oil to fry his chicken strips and fries, but it came out smelling and tasting like their fish and chips (and it wasn't just bc it was the same batter). But everyone else seemed to be having fun, so what do I know!

Our family loves Zookz. We've eaten here countless times. The sandwiches are good. The side items are good and the desserts are good. But the friendly, lovely owner makes this place so great to visit. She is ALWAYS so kind to my entire family. She has given us free sides when they've just been introduced to get our feedback, or a surprise treat for my children. Just a really special lady that cares about the people she serves and the food she puts out. Great combo. The people know your name and your order because they care and pay attention when you walk in.

Favorite pizza in Phoenix. Even better than the fancy pizza restaurants. The only problem is that I eat here too much and it's not cheap!

I usually don't review a place until I've been there 3 times. Maybe it's the "3rd times a charm" idea. This place is really good. The main reason it's good is because the food is real and fresh. I can see, know and identify every ingredient I'm eating. That matters in our family. And it's tasty! You can see the chef cooking your food in a very down home way and you can tell he cares about the food and his restaurant. I'm currently watching him clean and put away dishes.
