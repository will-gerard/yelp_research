They were about to close, but took my order and were very friendly and patient even though it was my first time there. Great food too! Lots of vegetarian options too. Definitely will be back.

My friends were trying to use this service and were denied because they are a lesbian couple. In this state it is legal to get married regardless of your sexual preference and this is an outrage. Any company that doesn't value love and equality is not a company worthy of my dollar, and in my opinion shouldn't be worth yours.
