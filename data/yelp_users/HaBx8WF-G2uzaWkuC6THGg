Of all of the Fili-b's I've been to in town, this is the best one! My favorite plate is the Super Nachos, every other Filiberto's is very stingy when it comes to this plate, but this one is very generous with their portions. This is the only Fili-b's I would recommend. Very nice. Very clean. Great salsa bar WITH CHIPS!

Don Jose is my FAVORITE Mexican food restaurant in the valley!!!! I've been eating here every week since I was 5yrs old.  The service is great the quality of their Mexican food compares to none, and more affordable than any Mexican food restaurant in the area!  The owner, Matt, is extremely friendly and cares most of all for his customers. It's great to see its still ran by great people for all these years.

Karaoke is completely biased to regulars. I got there at 8pm with an empty bar and requested 4 songs. I didn't get on til 11pm. Tried to talk to the dj about it and he ignore me. Strongly discourage others to come here.

Over Easy has really good food and service, but in my opinion they're a little over priced.

Their prices are way too steep for a very average burger. Not sure why everyone is so hyped up on this place.

I have worked with the John Glutch Group many times and couldn't recommend a greater group than them! Easy to work with and high quality customer service. Looking for a new home is tough, but wow... They make it easy! I couldn't be a happier!
