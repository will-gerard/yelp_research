Wow what amazing food and fantastic service. My group got 2 big jims, a bumblebee, poutine, and the welcome burger along with 3 old fashions. The drinks were served right away with the food very shortly after. All of the items were amazing and we will definitely be back many many many times.

This was my first time at SP. We waited about 15 min after being seated before someone came to take our order. We were never offered or asked if we wanted anything to drink. We started with pot stickers and egg roles then continued with orange chicken. After ordering, the pots tickers came right out and tasted old and deep fried when the menu said pan fried. Within 2 minutes after getting the appetizer our entree came out. It really worries me when food comes out that fast. All the food tasted old and refried and the fried rice was mushy.  The service was not good and no one came back to check on us or to refill our drinks. The waited disappeared and the only reason we got boxes or a check was because the busser  saw me looking around for service.   We will probably not return.

Just called and placed a delivery order and was told it's to late for delivery. Okay thinking to myself I asked "what time do you deliver till" the man said "9:15" . I looked at the time and it was 9:00. I said this to him and his response was "it's just too late we are busy and hungup". What horrible service. He could have said I'm so sorry we are unable to at the moment instead of saying it's too late and hanging up.

I am a local and I feel it's ridiculous to pay $10 to get into a pool that you then have to get up get out and walk to another part of the hotel to get your drinks. If your charging a cover to get in then have a server around the pool!!!! And the lady that informed us of this at the front desk was extremely rude.

Just moved into the neighborhood and came to check this place out because they sent over a flyer. We walked in and were sat within 3 minutes. The food and drinks looked great! We were excited because there was still 15 min left of happy hour. Little did I know that we would sit for the next 15 minutes at our table without anyone coming by. I tried to grab someone's attention but every time they just dodged me. We walked out and headed next door. If your busy it's understandable but at least bring by a water and greet the table. It's very rude and unprofessional to let a table sit for 15 min without acknowledging them. The Main Ingredient next door has been a much better experience.

Worst service in old town! 30 min to get a bottle of wine...when we asked the waitress which chard was more buttery her response wAs "I don't know I don't drink wine"...they brought out my friends first (we ordered at the same time) mine came out min later! I will probably never be back.

So they claim to be open till 11pm. We just walked in at 10:14 and we're greeted at the door with "I'm sorry we already did last call just a little bit ago and we are gunna close a little early." There were at least 15 people still in the restaurant and closing a little early doesn't mean doing last call an hour before you close. How unprofessional and just plain bad service. I understand it's tuesday and everyone wants to go home but you decided to be in the service industry. Needless to say we won't ever be back to support this place.

After having a really bad first impression and writing a review about a month ago we were contacted by Kennedy Turner from Taco Guild and invited us to return. This time things were much different. We walked in and was immediately greated. We decided to sit at the bar and was greeted by a wonderful bartender (forgot her name but she was pregnant). She told us about upcoming events and about the awesome new live music they have on saturdays. We asked for taco suggestions and we got some great ones. We ended up with the Pork Adavado, Thai snapper and the shrimp. They were all amazing.  I decided to update my review because I belive that they were very deserving of it. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend  this place! !!  Thank you Kennedy Turner for taking care of the original issue and going above and beyond to make sure recaptured our business.

What horrible service and customer service. Just finished having lunch there. We ordered the herd's burger off the lunch menu at $6.99 and even pointed to it. We asked for no cheese, it came out with cheese. After we finsihed and the bill we noticed they charged us for the regular burger $9.99. After letting waiter know he said that it wasn't his fault we ordered the wrong one. He didn't adjust it to the right price or anything.

WOW what amazing service from ashley! The whole crew was interactive and you could tell they loved their jobs but Ashley really went above and beyond when it came to recommendations and taking us through the menu! We will be back many many times.
