$10 for a medium drink, chicken sandwich, and a small salad = MEH! Overpriced and nothing special of this BBQ chicken sandwich.  I'll go back for a second try, someday...

Straight forward to get in and get out of the airport. The airport seems to be constantly updating certain areas each time I stop by!

Great customer service! The manager was great when my girlfriend wanted to switch the Fallout: New Vegas from the 360 to the PS3, by telling him our situation, he was able to change it for us.   Our 360 gave us the three-rings-of-death, so that's why she decided to switch to PS3.   I've always received great service from them!!

Been here twice and both times were good experiences with the Jade Red Chicken. This place should expand!

Delicious Korean food, the waiter/cashier is very polite! This is my default place to go for Korean food. Go for the their lunch specials, super cheap and filling!

Service was great and my chicken fried steak was so friggin delicious! Cheaper and great quality compared to a restaurant I usually grab from for chicken fried steak. This might be my primary spot to buy chicken fried steak from!

Great service, I didn't get steak from here (yes, I know...a steakhouse), just got the Zesty Thai Salmon. The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo, baked potato, and asparagus. Can't wait to go back to try their other dishes.  Thank you Kathy (owner) for taking the time to send me the name of the dish! Had to update this review and rating because of it :D

meh. it's alright...I ordered and had it delivered. We ordered two entrees and the second entree didn't come with rice (when it's suppose to).   I'm willing to give it a second shot, but I've had better Chinese food.

As I promised myself, I'd go back again to try it again. Yyyeeaahhhh...sooooo....the food is still not good. I got the mongolian beef and it's like "wha? really? is this IRL?"   I'm a chinese food kind of a fan, this restaurant, I'm not a fan of.

I am very happy with the service I received from Autostaat, especially from Michael who is the owner of this fine establishment.   I own a 2000 Audi S4 since 2002 and I've been deciding whether if it's worth keeping or not. I've had a handful of problems in the past, the S4 and I have a love and hate relationship. Before discovering Autostaat, I took the S4 to a previous euro repair shop. Long story short, I wasn't impressed with their service and what their estimates were, I might as well have taken my car to a dealership.   What I should do is actually thank them, the situation forced me to search elsewhere on Yelp and I found Autostaat. I called and spoke with Michael over the phone and we began to exchange emails of what the S4 needed. I provided Michael with the document of the parts and labor estimates (via email), that the previous euro repair shop had documented (fully inspected). The next day he sent me an email with his labor estimates and I was impressed. I showed Michael what I was purchasing from an OEM/Performance German parts website. He confirmed the parts that I was planning to purchase and I finalized the order.   I received my parts and scheduled a time to drop my car off to him. I work the daily grind hours from Monday through Fridays, so I asked if I can drop my car off on a Sunday morning. He met with me as scheduled at his shop (which I really appreciated) and he discussed the process of the installation and repair.   Michael called me and informed me both Monday and Tuesday what he encountered, without me calling him with a status. He had my car for about two days and by Wednesday, Michael contacted me to let me know that my S4 was ready.   I dropped by that evening and he explained in detail what he went through to repair my S4. He took the time to answer all the questions I had of my car and he was very patient with me. I definitely received a lot of insight from him and I respect what he and his shop are all about.   Overall, the service, communication, and costs were the best I've ever received from a euro repair shop, since I've owned my S4. If you own a European vehicle and you've been searching for a reliable mechanic in the Glendale area, look no further because Autostaat is there to meet your needs.

Been awhile since I ate a great hotdog. Reminded me when i was in Chicago and took a bite, I was like OMG WTF THIS IS AWESOME. I'm definitely coming back here. Be sure to grab a Chicago style hotdog, you won't regret it.
