Well - they have food that is sometimes decent.   An order of cheese sticks came out without the cheese on the inside being melted. I politely asked them if they can put it back in the microwave where it came from and they were happy to do so. You could tell the food wasn't just prepared. Chicken wings are pretty good but awfully small compared to many other establishments.   Service has been hit or miss in the 3 times I have gone here (You got to give everyone a fair chance right?). I think for what they offer and at the prices they offer it for, you would be better off going somewhere else.

Saigon Pho doesn't have a fancy sign, great decor or even windows you can look in/out of. But who cares when you have the most amazing Pho in the valley (and at the best prices)? The servings are very big and everything averages about $6 a plate. Staff is very attentive and quick to deliver the goods.  As you can read through the various other reviews - everyone has a favorite dish. I have a problem with gluttony so I can't suggest a single dish - I can only suggest them all. However, this place also has some of the best Salt and Pepper calamari I've ever had.

Let me start this review by saying that this Home Depot has to be one of the worst in the state.   Generally speaking this store has always been messy, disorganized and had at least mediocre customer service. But my last two visits really exemplified their ability to disservice anyone attempting to make some purchases (at least me anyways).  It began with my first quest to purchase some bathroom tile, liner, mortar - you know, all the goods for a bathroom remodel. I had used their handy website to make sure everything I wanted was in stock. Upon arriving to my aisle I noticed the entire section of my tile brand / type was empty! After walking around that area for about 3-5 minutes I had to flag someone down from another department who could flag someone down from this department. Total time to speak to someone: about 6 minutes (I can still live with this timeframe).   Unfortunately the person I was speaking to was just "filling in" but could inform me that they DID have the tile I wanted in stock, as the site indicated, but that for some treason no one had restocked it. Cool? He then stated he had to find someone, to locate it and bring it down. I was left alone for about 15 minutes as he "searched" for appropriate people. Not an exaggeration. Not an oversight in my time keeping abilities. But I was left alone for 15 minutes. At this point - I just walked out and chalked it up to a bad experience.   Today, about a week and a half after my last experience I figured I would give this store a chance for redemption - plus it's really close to me.  As I arrive in the tile area I was shocked to see the exact same products I had come in for last week were still NOT stocked. Again, I ask (a different) the associate if it's in stock, and again I get the "yes it is, we just have to bring it down" response. I ask if this can be done but get a "The person working this area that can do it is somewhere else".   Fed up - especially since the store has had the request for this tile, basic white subway tile (for the record), and since both times they tell me it's in stock (and so does the website), I just leave. On the way out I tell the door greeter that the service is atrocious and he should let his manager know in walking out.  His response? He chuckled and said "oh, you think so?"

Lee's is a place that everyone in the East Valley should have on their map. Yes, the food is pretty good - but you really want to go here for their bread! That is what makes this place happen.  Now the sandwiches are pretty good as well. It's not a bad place to stop by if it's near by and you want a quick eat. Here is the trick though: no matter what sandwich you order you must "make it a double" for about $1.50 more. Without these magic words, and small cost increase, the food is kind of on the light side.

As the weather gets cooler in Arizona there is no better meal than a little Pho (pronounced fuh). Pho Van was very quick to seat us, the staff was amazing in taking our order and explaining the various dishes and the food came out lighting fast! The decor was very nice and the entire restaurant was spotless making it a comfortable situation to really sit and enjoy conversation with our meal.  I sprung for the beef round and brisket pho, chicken noodle pho (for the kiddo), the regular beef round (for the lady) and some spring rolls. All four items were amazingly fresh and flavorful. The food alone makes this one of my all time favorite Pho restaurants in the valley. The cherry on top was when the owner came out to ask us our thoughts and ensure that we loved everything he had cooked for us. Kudos good sir - because you now made all three of us patrons for a long, long time.  I think it's almost important to mention that this was one of the first places that actually offered children's dishes at a slightly reduced rate (about a buck less). Plates and appetizers averaged a cost about $6

I love this place. You'll be warmly greeted by the staff / owners, served quickly and you just feel like your a part of this place.  To be honest, I would still come here if they weren't so nice to me. I love the pizza. I prefer to call ahead for pickup so I can take it back and devour it in private. Cannoli's are spot on. Baked Ziti is okay - I've had better. Pizza is amazing. Garlic knots are okay - I've had better. Pizza is addicting.

What do I have to say about Starbucks? You know who they are, you know what they serve and you can basically expect the same great service throughout the valley. It's Starbucks.

Eh...  I've eaten here a number of times due to my misfortune of being stuck near the location or because visiting friends want to give it a try. That being said - I think I have had a few items in every category in hopes of not being disappointed. It never works out.  The sandwiches use run-of-the-mill restaurant supply bread allowing it to be stale (if you go later in the week) or even completely out of the more unique variety  - such as wheat. For the average price of about $10 I expect fresh bread. Even subway makes it fresh and they change almost 50% less.   Burgers are the best item on the menu (taste wise), boneless wings are very small, everything is over priced but they do have some GREAT tasting sauces!  To give the sandwich shop some credit the staff has always been great, the location is very clean and . . . well they make the food for me when I ask them to?  If you're looking for a place for a great sandwich look no further than Harvey American Public House in the same shopping center.

The wife and I stopped in one night after a workout, perhaps a bit under dressed in our gym clothing, not knowing what to expect. Despite our extremely casual attire we were treated with the utmost respect and provided with amazing service! Our server walked us through the menu items and even made some personal suggestions to his favorite dishes. Leaving the choice to our server - we were surprised with two great meals that just melted in our mouth.  I was in love with this place: intimate setting, great service, amazing food &... and then it happened. As we ended our night the server asked if we would like to cap the night with a coffee (The wife and I are coffee snobs). What came out was a cup of silky smooth, full of bold flavor, just the right temperature coffee. This wasn't just good coffee. This was GREAT coffee. To this day - it is the best coffee we've ever had in Arizona.

How can you not like a shooting range? It's guaranteed fun and a great way to spend an hour or two of your day.   The people are friendly and it's close to my house - you get 4 stars. The only reason I knocked one off is because I always have a bit of a wait (so maybe bring a sack lunch - or don't go on weekends) and the reload ammo they sell is a tad bit expensive. But that's not the biggest of deals. I'll continue to shoot here.
