We went to see the zoo lights while visiting Phoenix.  I am certain the lights took a very long time to put up and people worked hard to put on the show but I,  personally,  wasn't impressed.

I can't think of a single complaint. I would rather stay here again than any other fancier hotel. Here are some highlights:  Hotel shuttle for $10 if you need to be picked up.  Hotel shuttle that will drive you and pick you up anywhere within a 3 mile radius (approximate)  Excellent staff that are welcoming and hospitable  Delicious spa water in the lobby at all times Free Drink and snacks at check in  Free wifi and wired internet Hot cookies and milk in the evenings Free alcohol, sodas,  and appetizers for happy hour nightly Free hot breakfast buffet with several options to satisfy all palates Very spacious and clean rooms with great features like small fridge/freezer and microwave along with coffee maker,  iron,  and blow dryer.  Awesome spa grade shower jet. (very important!)  Comfortable beds   I am sure I'm forgetting something but seriously if this is how all Holiday Inn Express hotels are,  I will never stay at a other chain again!

This place was really good...probably the best meal we had in Las Vegas and we ate at a lot of places.  I ordered the Spicy Ying Nan soup -- it was very flavorful but be careful if you're weirded out by seafood.  There were fish balls, squid balls, and shrimp in it.  Imagine a meatball made out of ground fish and squid (calamari).  They were fine though.  My friend ordered the Won Ton soup and it was really good too.  Give this place a try!  They were open until 3 am and packed!

This place isn't bad by any means....it's just nothing to write home about. If you want Tex Mex in Vegas, this place might do it for you but I'm from Texas and the food wouldn't stand a chance in the Lone Star State.  We ordered the chips and salsa ($4) and they were pretty good.  We also had the chicken fajitas and they came with all the right things (pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese, and guacomole) and everything was cooked well but it just wasn't awesome -- it was definitely a good attempt though.

Jodi did an amazing job with my horrible hair. I'm shocked that it can look this good. Then, Sasha airbrushed my face. I've never had my makeup done before and she did a very nice job as well. The final stage was eyelash extensions by Cynthia! I feel glamorous now! They did a great job and I'll be back the next time I'm in Arizona.

A+ service. A+ food. Excellent way to start off out Scottsdale vacation!   We came at a busy time with a 20 month old who was hungry,  tired,  and cranky from sitting in an airplane and then a car seat for hours.   Even know there was a wait, they seated as quickly and one of the ladies, who later I found out was Denise, one of the owners, brought out a plate with chopped turkey, ham, cheese, and strawberries for our little one to start munching while we decided what to order.  So kind!   I had the poblano burger on a pretzel bun with a side of Jamaican corn and my husband had p_b and see a burger on a brioche bun. He opted for sweet potato tots his side.   The place had several children, but no children's menu. They were so nice to tell us that they could do a variety of different things for the kids and we ended up getting a taco with chicken and cheese for our son. We asked him to please bring it out as soon as possible even if our food wasn't ready yet. They brought it out very quickly and when the bill came, the even said the taco was on the house because they knew how hungry he was and they didn't bring it out fast enough for their liking.   Such a wonderful place, a wonderful atmosphere, kind people, an excellent food! If this place was in my hometown, I would be there every week.

Oh my goodness,  that was a culinary experience.    It's our last night in Scottsdale and after 10 pm. My husband says,  "I'm going to go get some food"  I told him that I wasn't hungry and to not get anything for me and I might just take a few bites of whatever he gets. Well, he knows me better than that, and brought home four boxes of food.   We got the tot of the day which was a very good start to the meal followed by 1 order of the tongue pastrami sandwich and one order of the pork burger. The burger is called apocalypse sow. Hehe.   I'm not really a fan of tongue so pastrami sandwich, while very good isn't something that I would order myself. The burger, however, was freaking fantastic! I have to say, I've never had a more balanced or better burger. It wasn't even beef! How can I dare say this? It was just that damn good. Soft bread, delicious caramelized onions, homemade bacon, that itself was to die for, and a deliciously seasoned patty. The best.  I would actually consider coming back to Scottsdale just eat this burger.
