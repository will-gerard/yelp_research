Amazing restaurant. Makes you feel like you are in the middle of Italy! Service was top notch. A great place to go if you want to eat a nice long meal with a bottle of wine. We split a truffle oil and arugula pizza that was delicious. I got the chicken cannelloni, wow, it is heavy, but great flavor.  My coworker got a risotto dish that was fantastic as well. No complaints about anything!

I went to Scottsdale for a girls weekend and liked this place so much that I came here twice over 4 days! The outside patio is awesome and they have a great happy hour. All of the food that I tired was on point as well and everyone in our group liked their food. The first time I came here was for happy hour and we tried the bruschetta and truffle fries. All of the bruschetta's were bomb! Plus they were huge, split into 3 pieces, so it was perfs to share. To top it off they were $3 each. Steal! We each has the sangria and that was delish. I came back for Easter brunch a couple days later and we had the bread and pesto dipping sauce, wow! Everyone was talking about how good it was. I ordered the Mediterranean salad and it was soooo good! It was light, but filling. I even put a little of the pesto dipping sauce on top. My friends ordered the hummus, the Cobb salad, and the parfait. Everyone liked what they got. There literally was not a single complaint. Then to top it off we tried the cinnamon roll. This was super good. I only had a couple bites and we all passed it around. It's good if you go with a group to share with everyone. I definitely recommend this restaurant. It's right on the canal as well so it has great ambiance.

This restaurant has it all. The view is amazing, hanging out in the lounge before going to the restaurant for amazing food is a must. The lounge is awesome. Great setup.  Now for the restaurant, amazing. Good, service, staff, ambiance, absolutely everything that you want from a nice restaurant.

Great food! Great atmosphere! Great prices! We found this place walking through the forum shops and it was perfect. There are a couple other restaurants nearby that are more expensive and a more limited menu. The food here was great and flavorful. My coworker got the mushroom lasagna and it was delisssssshhhhhh! It was rich but in a good way. I had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was very flavorful and fresh. Definitely recommend.

All I can say is they have the BEST chicken tenders I've ever had! We ended up going a couple times when we needed a snack or it was a little later and everything else was closed. Everything we tried was excellent. Great quality food and flavor and such great prices! They are open 24 hours, which sometimes can mean less quality food and that is not the case. Definitely will be back the next time I am in Vegas.

I wasn't too impressed with this place. Servers were rude and the vibe was so so. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and that was good. It came with sweet potato fried and they were really good. They came with this weird cinnamon sauce on the side. I ordered ranch instead it was a good move. We just came here for dinner and left, so I wouldn't really recommend. There are tons of other good places to eat in the area.
