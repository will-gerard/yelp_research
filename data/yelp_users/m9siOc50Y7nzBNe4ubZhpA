I have been doing business with Hay's Cooling & Heating since 1998. Chris, Stacia and the Hay's team provide, quality, service & value for money. I trust Chris and his staff implicitly.

The local Fountain Hills Leslie's manager Sue did not listen to my concerns, she had her own agenda. I requested that she price a few replacement parts for my Hayward Navigator pool cleaner. Sue proceeded to brow beat me with her laundry list of unnecessary overpriced parts and repairs. In the end all she wanted to do was to talk over me, flirt with the local female UPS driver making a stock delivery and sell me a new pool cleaner. High pressure, empty service. Sue would be better suited to driving a long haul truck than representing Leslie's. My experience was so bad that I am meeting with the local Leslie's area manager to discuss the totality of my experience.

My rating is based on my experience at the Kierland Commons location. I have been a P.F. Chang's customer since they opened, and have hosted many business lunches, family lunches, dinners an special occasions over the past years.  2 stars for marginal service & average food quality. This chain started off as 4 stars and has been in a steady decline since 2006.  I just gave P.F. Chang's a chance to redeem themselves last week with a party of 8. The food was a 3, the overall experience was below average. I tried to engage the server and have some fun but she was a ROBOT and did the absolute minimum.

This review is for the FLW location only. I watched and waited as this location was converted to Fresh & Easy from a former Osco Drugs in December of 2007. During the remodeling I researched the F&E concept and its parent company, global retail giant UK based TESCO.  According to my Quicken, I have shopped at the FLW F&E 229 times in the past 3 1/2 years. About 5.5 times a month on average.  Small market convenience, simple store layout & design, green facilities & practices, spotless/tidy isles, quality house brands, fresh prepared meals, fair prices, great e-coupons, quick, (easy to use) self checkout, consistent friendly service.  I am a huge fan of F&E Produce, Prepared Salads, Entr√©es & Soups, Cheese Trays, Juice, Soy Milk, Iced Green Tea, Chewy Peanut Butter & Chocolate Chip Granola Bars to name a few.  Quality, Service, Cleanliness & Value...

Joined Lifetime Fitness N. Scottsdale pre-opening, December 2006. I terminated my membership August of 2010.  I am taking the time to write this review today because LTF continues to market to me as a former LTF member.   Between December 2006 & August 2010, (44 months) my average monthly spend for membership and PT was $425.29. When I attempted to resolve a minor service issue with the club's general manager Ray Haizlip my concern was marginalized, Ray did nothing to retain my business.   In the end I was seriously under whelmed with Ray's one size fits all, transactional approach to my business and loyalty.  Nice facility, impersonal, inflexible, poor value...

Lifetime Fitness continues to market to me via snail, email and telephone. When I express my reason for terminating my membership they respond by pitching me with their latest "we miss you" promotional offer to return. In the end Lifetime is just another nobody cares organization. Perhaps the company's CEO - insensitive self absorbed Bahram Akradi needs to climb down from the company Hawker Jet and his 7 figure salary to read a few Yelp* reviews.

This was my first time at the Cosmo, stayed 06.19 - 06.21.11. Received an invitation for a complementary Terrace Studio, F&B + Identity Play, so I decided to take them up on their offer.  Beautiful 4 billion dollar hotel, contemporary, high end finishes, feels smaller than it is...  The woman at check-in was my second staff impression after a very courteous doorman held the door and welcomed me to the Cosmo.  This front desk staffer was robotic & soulless, the human equivalent of an ATM. I tried my best to engage her, after all I was in Las Vegas to enjoy myself and excited to experience all the Cosmo had to offer.   She could care less, no welcome, no explanation of the hotel or it's vast amenities, she looked down continuously, minimized eye contact, and rushed me through the check-in process. What was the rush? Her colleagues were standing around because the front desk was so slow, no one was waiting. In the end she mumbled something about a premium view and our room not being ready.   Clearly the wrong person for the job. She would be better suited in a behind the scenes position with zero guest interaction.    After check-in, things improved... We ate breakfast at The Henry, food was a 7, service was an 8, cocktails we're a 10. Then off to the LV Convention Center to attend an event.  When we returned early evening, the front desk staff was very accommodating. Our Terrace Studio Suite was excellent. The view of the Bellagio Fountains and Las Vegas Strip rocked. Comfy bed with European bedding, sleek furnishings, 2 LED, HDTVs, luxurious bath, shower & soaking tub, efficiency with microwave, dishwasher & Sub-Zero, outstanding private terrace with lounger.  My only interaction with the housekeeper assigned was poor. Her overall demeanor was unresponsive, like she had the life sucked out of her. Later I had a housekeeping issue so I called guest services, it was resolved by another staff member within 20 minutes.   Dined at Holsteins, Kobe beef burger was amazing, mac & cheese appetizer was poor, booze-infused shakes were delicious. Overall food and service was a respectable 8.  Tried the pizzeria late night after seeing Holly Madison's Peep Show at Planet Hollywood. The staff was upbeat and accommodating, the pizza, mediocre. Food a 6, service gets a 9.   *Overall the Cosmo is a 5 star property that delivers a 3 1/2 star experience. I am going to give them some time to fine tune operations and try them again...

Purchased a sofa online for the reception/lobby areas of Divine Skin Spa, Tatum & Greenway N. Scottsdale. Excellent online experience, on-time delivery and set up, good value for money. So good in fact, that I am making additional LS purchases for our business office next week.
