We have only ever had good experiences with Responsible. The techs are always polite and prompt. We had such an issue with scorpions and fortunately, haven't since using Responsible.

Unfortunately our experience has not been a pleasant one. More to come as we are still in the midst of this customer service nightmare. Know this... the "100% Satisfaction Guaranteed" advertisement on their page is just that...AN ADVERTISEMENT that is not being honored.
