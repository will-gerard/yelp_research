I think this building was a house before they turned it into a restaurant because the halls are a bit narrow and the rooms are a bit small, but the food is great! They give you chips and salsa while you are waiting for your food and their salsa is home made and delicious! Their margaritas are amazing and huge (if you get the large) and pretty strong ;) . I wouldn't suggest you don't go on a Friday night for dinner because they do get pretty busy and the wait gets pretty long.

After my friend took me to a pho restaurant in Mesa, I was wanted to find a place closer to where I live.  Their pho at 43rd express was ok, but they didn't have tofu pho for veg heads or a variety of teas. Oh, and a heads up, it's cash only!

Ok so after my last review (4 years ago) I decided to go back solely because of all the hype of their macrons. (I'm a sucker for those things!!) went in, tried their  ice cream macron and they were awesome!! Extra star for amazing customer service and awesome macrons. Will definitely be back again! Oh and they use the square reader now for cards!

Coming from Seattle where they have good Asian spots everywhere, finding a good pho restaurant was hard. DaVang had really good pho. I had the tofu pho and the tofu was lightly fried just how I prefer:) the broth was amazing and it was a bigger building than most I've seen in Arizona. It's one of those "hole in the wall" type restaurants, but sometimes I think that's the best places for real authentic oriental food. I now come here at least 3 times a month ;)

This is right in the Walmart plaza next to Game Stop. I've been to this location a couple times, and even though its not the best location, their staff is really friendly. There's a girl who works there (and I never get her name), but she's been pretty helpful the past couple times. She always asks if anyone needs help finding anything, and is super helpful.  I was looking for mannequins and wigs and even though they didn't carry wigs, she let me know where the nearest Sally's location that did carry wigs.  Overall great customer service, and great products.

So I'm sure everyone has been to an Applebees in their lifetime. This particular location has terrible customer service! I've been there a few times hoping their customer service improves and only because it is a close location to where I live and for their happy hour. When you walk in you normally have to eye down the hosts or waiters to know that you are there waiting. Rarely is there anyone greeting you. They take a while with their food even when it's not busy, and their food is typically really salty. I wouldn't recommend this location, only if you're desperate for some cheap drinks during happy hour.

The server who I'm assuming is the owner was super nice and on point with everything. Fast, clean, and good customer service. My boyfriend and I got their chicken spring rolls, chicken pad Thai, and tried their roasted duck. Everything was great! I normally don't like duck, but I tried it and was pretty good. My boyfriend demolished it!! Definitely recommend this place.

Who doesn't like Frozen Yogurt?! This location is great because it is right next to the Harkins Theatre in Avondale. Since there are so many people coming in and out of the movie theatre, the line can get a bit long, but it does move quickly. They have a lot of flavors and great toppings. They are regularly clean and have pretty good customer service. It's a great snack before, during, or after a flick!

Scooptacular has home made ice cream and is soo delish! They have a lot of flavors and have some yummy seasonal flavors too. I love their pumpkin cheesecake / pumpkin pie during the holidays. Their cookie monster is amazing!  They have cupcakes and ice cream cakes as well. Definitely recommend this place. They do a lot for the community which makes them a better local ice cream shop!

You just gained new customers!  After a bad experience at another new bakery, Dale recommended I try Kreative Kupcakes. (Thank goodness for social networking and Yelp!) My roommate and I headed out there today, and grabbed a few cupcakes. They're a bit pricey, but most gourmet cupcakes are. We purchased Red Velvet, Caramel Frappuccino,  Oreo, and Banana Pudding. I'm not gonna lie, I wanted to try them ALL!   We hurried home, shared these with my boyfriend, and we were pretty much in heaven. The cupcakes were moist, and fluffy, and the frosting was just the right amount of sweetness. My boyfriend said "Give them 5 stars, that was the best cupcake I've had in a while" My roommate said "I don't normally like frosting, but I could eat this by itself!"  The frosting is better than Sprinkles, the cake is just perfection. I'm glad to have found this place especially on the West Valley, and will definitely be coming by again. :)

My friend and I are big gourmet cupcake junkies and have been on the search to review a new one. We saw Caketini and decided to kill two birds with one stone: splurge on cupcakes and go shopping!  Their shop was cute and small and they had a HUGE selection. They're selection was so big, it took me literally 10 minutes to decide what I wanted to try. They had other goodies like cake pops and cannolis. I had their Salted Caramel cupcake and cookies and cream cake pop. Their cupcakes were huge! ( I couldn't even finish it!) The cake was soft and moist and the frosting was super smooth and tasty. The cake pop was delicious and I was pretty much chocolate wasted at this point.  The had a great tea and coffee selection to along with their cakes, and the staff was pretty helpful as to recommending what cupcakes were best sellers.

I read some of the "bad customer service" reviews on yelp; I'm not sure if it was because I was the only customer at that time or what, but our customer service wasn't bad.   They took my order, and delivered my food on time. The broth for the pho was so good! I felt like it was more flavorful than Da Vang's, but they didnt have tofu pho available. I had the chicken pho and it was really tasty! At previous experiences at other Vietnamese restaurants, their chicken pho was too fatty and oily. I thought their pho was perfection! Their spring rolls were pretty good although I would prefer more shrimp or larger shrimp in it. They also carry boba which I find pretty rare here in Arizona.   Overall, I thought Pho House was pretty good and will be coming again to try their bahn mi and other products on the menu.

I LOVE gourmet cupcakes, and was incredibly stoked to see that there was going to be a cupcake shop relatively nearby. I came in on their opening day. The staff was friendly, and the shop was cute, but they were only displaying four cupcake flavors. On opening day,  I would expect a better showcase of their flavors, but their staff explained how they will be more in the future. Their staff was very friendly and informative.  I ordered a Cookie Monster, Kahlua, and Pink Pistachio Champagne (that may not be the exact name) I hurried home and shared these with my boyfriend. Being a cupcake gourmet lover, (and Cupcake Wars addict) I kind of have high standards. I dug into the Pink Pistachio champagne first. Not sure if I got a bad batch, but the cake was on the dry side. The frosting was nice and smooth and decorated really nice. The Kahlua might have been the most moist, and the Kahlua flavor was definitely there. (Maybe a little too much) but the texture of the cake was better than the last. Lastly, the Cookie Monster. I liked the bits cookies inside and their decoration was cute. The frosting looked and tasted a little too artificial in my opinion, and the cake was on the dry side too.  All in all, I was a bit disappointed by Pixy Cakes. I don't usually give negative reviews, and believe that they have huge opportunity to improve. I will probably be checking by again in a few months to see if they have any other flavors that I might enjoy.

I went to Pita Kitchen a few weeks ago, and was very excited to get some decent hummus nearby. The staff was friendly, and seemed to know their menu pretty well.  I ordered a the Chicken Shawarma with hummus. They accidentally messed up my order and gave me a greek salad. I'm not really one to complain, but I was really craving some hummus. I let the staff know, and they apologized and let me keep the salad as they prepped my hummus.  The chef came out and apologized again, then late came out a few minute later to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I was very impressed with their customer service and how professional they were. It was as we were getting fine dining customer service in a fast food style restaurant.   Overall, the food was great, and the customer service made it that much better. I will definitely be coming by more often!
