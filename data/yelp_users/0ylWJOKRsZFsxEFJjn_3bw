Cheap drinks, tasty bitters, nice bartenders, a sweet jukebox, dark, leather couches, old movies, and billiards....what more can you ask for?!

I spend so much time at verizon stores just trying to get a working phone. Instead of a working phone that I pay 90.00 a month for, they just send me busted refurbished phones...why do I bother

The beer just keeps getting better and better. One of their newest brews is a red ale called Bock at the Moon. I highly recommend getting a pitcher of it and not sharing with anybody...because it's delicious...make them get their own pitcher! And it's only $6 on happy hour, you really can't beat that deal.   As for food, check out the flatbreads. The Pisa is amazing as well as the Grilled Chicken Flat  Prost!

Pretty cool place with a very different design concept. Walk up window for beer ordering? Yes please! Lots of helpful staff members. Have not tried the food yet but I'm sure it's great.  The parking looks a little cramped but I didn't have any issues. You all should try it!
