This nail salon and one of the nail technicians, Helen, came very highly recommended by my personal trainer, Olivia. I had called mid-afternoon  on a Tuesday and was able to get an appointment for an hour and a half later. It must have been my lucky day since it was the first day their salon was open on Tuesdays.  Helen is beyond amazing! She is very meticulous and did a wonderful job with my gel manicure.  She was able to create a pink and white ombr√© topped with glitter; I am getting so many compliments on my nails! I will definitely be back! Thank you so much, Helen!

It's easy to miss this hidden gem but you won't want to. Small menu, but the food is excellent. I was a little skeptical to try it but I'm glad my cousin talked me into going. Gyros and cevapis are definite musts, along with the Turkish coffee.

Tonight has got to be one of the best flights I have ever been on. The flight departed on time AND landed waaay before the scheduled arrival time. There were some empty seats on the newer aircraft so there was plenty of room. The highlight of the trip: Dan, the flight attendant. He is incredibly funny and had a way with his intercom announcements that EVERYONE was listening to the airbag and seat belt safety instructions. We even got a lovely song from him upon landing! Thank you Southwest for reaffirming that you are one of the best airlines to fly with!

I definitely prefer to shop at a Safeway than at Fry's, two words: less crowded. The overall shopping experience is calmer and less chaotic, almost like you are at a higher end grocery store.  Sure prices are mostly a tad bit higher, but for the price of my sanity and not fearing being run over by grocery carts, I'll go to Safeway any day!  I am subtracting one star for the fact that it seems like after 9pm, every night, they only have 1 cashier open?? The line has been like 5-6 people deep for 1 check out line. They are always quick and friendly which helps. This isn't a deal breaker for me, since I still go there, just may be a point of improvement.

Been here a few times already, basically every time I get a bagel craving on the way to work. It's small local business hidden in an industrial complex and maybe a little hard to find. The bagels here are reminiscent of bagels I would eat from NJ/NY. Hearty with just the right amount of chewiness. I always get an everything bagel with either plain or lox cream cheese. I haven't tried the other bagels but I'm sure they are all equally amazing.

I absolutely love Pizza Hut! My personal favorite is what we would call in the Philippines as a Hawaiian pizza, a regular Pan pizza with pepperoni, ham and pineapple.   I've ordered a few times from this particular location before and they have been awesome. All the workers have been nice and attentive.  I think my Hawaiian pizza works best with a medium size as opposed to the large because pineapples might add a more wet component to the pizza? It was still so good, though.   I always place my order online using a coupon from Retailmenot.com, get dressed, drive over to pick up my order, drive home and enjoy! Easy peasy!

It's been a few years since I've been here and I guess business must be booming since they are expanding to the next storefront. For a Monday, they were pretty busy but my friend and I didn't have to wait, gel mani for me and pedi for my friend.  Michelle was fabulous! She asked what I wanted and even though I thought I wasn't being very clear, she executed it flawlessly! She was very meticulous about making sure all the hangnails were removed and the manicure was perfect!   I'm only giving it four stars because I have had similar quality manicures for $25, so for what I had done, $35 is a bit pricy for me. I will still go back if I'm ever in the area needing my nails done.

The bananas foster French toast was delicious but my favorite was the pear omelette! I would have never thought that the combo of pear, cheese, bacon, almonds &  eggs would work. It would have received 5 stars if it didn't take them about 20 minutes to bring out my food when it wasn't even that busy.

Absolutely loved my experience here! I lucked out that Christine had a cancellation that day so I was able to come in.   Everything was clean and it's definitely one of the more modern nail salons I've been to in the area.   I love how I was in and out in about an hour, but I wasn't rushed out the door like most nail salons when they are busy.   Christine is absolutely wonderful and is a Nail Art Master!! I never imagined that free hand detailed nail art could look so amazing. I scrolled through her previous designs on Pinterest and let her know which one I liked and she went with it. Although, I'm sure that if I just let her come up with a design on her own, it would have been great as well. She is very meticulous and detailed and made sure my nails were perfect.   I absolutely loved that she asked me if I was the type who wanted the designs on both hands to match. As a self-proclaimed OCD individual, I appreciated this, even though I just gave her free reign. I had an amazing experience and will definitely be back! Christine is your girl if you are looking for an awesome manicure!

Let me preface my review by saying that I have been going to this place for a few years now and I like them. You can't really beat the $2.75/item to be dry cleaned. So I keep going back to them, my clothes are cleaned, I'm happy.  However, their phone demeanor is another story.  This is first time I have called to check on my dry cleaning to see if it was possible to be picked up before 4pm.  I had dropped of my items around 9am Thursday and hoping to pick up the items on Friday before 4pm.  I would have totally understood if I couldn't pick it up earlier. Linda answered the phone with an ATTITUDE. If it was not possible, then okay. It is not necessary to have an irritating tone when answering a customer's question.   I can understand that we may all have bad days, but when you work in customer service (which I know firsthand having worked in this field myself), you must be mindful of how you come across to customers. You are a representative of the company you work for!  This really left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm not sure if there has been a change in owners but I definitely do not remember ever being treated this way. I will be taking my business elsewhere.

The service is 5 stars, water glasses were always full and the food was brought out right away.  The food was meh.  The fried egg rolls were okay, a little too bland for my taste; and the lettuce served with them could have been fresher, they looked so lifeless.  My friend got the pork & shrimp spring rolls, but it was 95% rice noodle, 5% pork & 0% shrimp.  The pho was pretty bland, lacking the beefy/meaty flavor normally found in the soup.  Even with all the hoisin sauce that I put in, it was still so bland.  I would come back here, but only because it's near my friend's place. Hopefully, the rice dishes are better.

i never knew that a chai tea latte could get any better, but apparently it can... just add caramel & boba!  For me, adding those tapioca pearls, with just the right chewiness factor, makes any drink better.  I will definitely be coming back for more!

I ordered the Mango Sweet, which according to the menu is brown rice, breaded chicken and mango salsa. What I received was an orange chicken type white rice bowl without a single trace of mango salsa. When I asked our server if the salsa was already in the bowl, he said yes, so I guess my definition of salsa must just be different from theirs. Despite that, the flavors were okay, enough to satisfy a super hungry stomach, but it's highly doubtful that I'll be coming back.

Love that this is so close to church so I can get my Mango Loco fix that much quicker. The place is very clean and has several tables to accommodate customers. It's super helpful that they have posters of the various menu items so you can have an idea of what you're getting.   BONUS: They carry Thrifty's ice cream!! Yippee!

These are the absolute best lashes ever! I got my lashes done by Kayla at the Scottsdale location.... SHE. IS. AMAZING! I've had lash extensions done at a different place and they felt hard & stiff. The set Kayla gave me is gorgeous, full and I can hardly tell I have extensions on. Thank you so much, Lash & Sugar, esp. Kayla for my lashes!!

Garrison Fitness has moved from its Grovers Avenue location to the 51st Avenue location!  So I'm moving over my review here so everyone can know how amazing this personal training is!!  Olivia is a total game-changer! She is everything a personal trainer should be and more! If you are willing to put in the hard work (and yes, she will make you work hard!) and stick with the training and meal plans she creates specifically to meet your needs, you WILL see results!  I have always been so leery of "personal trainers".  I did not want someone just dictating to me what exercises I needed to do on my own in some big corporate gym while he/she just watched me, literally, without providing feedback. Or even worse, I did not want a personal trainer, who was also training other people while he/she was supposedly training me. I mean, for the investment of training sessions, I better be the only client at the time!  I had gained about 50-60 lbs over the course of 2-3 years tipping the scales at 220 lbs and not active at all. I had been eating clean for 2 months and had lost 10 lbs on my own prior to meeting with Olivia. Within 5 months of working out with her, my body has drastically changed! I actually look forward to working out.   When the weather was nicer, she actually ran outside with me, staying with me throughout my turtle-like pace. I have never heard of a trainer who actually works out, let alone RUN with their clients. She corrects my form during weight training, always motivating me to believe that I am able to push through my limitations, more so than I ever thought possible. I cannot wait to see how much more my body will change throughout my fitness journey.   Training with Olivia, I KNOW my results will be nothing short of AMAZING.

#1 Fried Rice reminds me of Chinese food that I grew up eating in New Jersey. Good food in HUGE portions and ridiculously affordable, that combination can't be beat!  Everything I have tried from their menu has not disappointed. My absolute favorite is the chicken katsu with fish fillets (humongous) sub fried rice. I have enough food to last me for several meals. Aside from their delicious fish fillets, their food is your typical Chinese takeout. I would still keep coming because I love being able to pay less than $7 for 3 lbs of food!
