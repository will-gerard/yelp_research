I'm sorry, but a few heavy bursts of air is NOT enough for me. I had read the reviews of this place on here and thought, this place is GREAT! I'm going to have to go there. Even though it's a bit out of my way, I made the 'trek' to Clean Freak Car Wash.   Their "Obsessively Clean" package seemed great to me. $22/mo for unlimited full package car washes (usually $10 each), AND you weren't billed until NEXT month (so a whole month free of car washes if you sign up early in the month)! Foolishly, I signed up. I figured I'd be coming back often, based on the glowing reviews. Little did I know that I wouldn't be able to cancel and not be billed (it needs to be seven days before the next billing cycle, and like I said, I stupidly signed up two days before the end of the month).   ANYWAY, that's not what I don't like about this place. It's their right to have whatever cancellation policy they wish, and I was an idiot for not thinking ahead.   First off-- as I went through the wash, their rollers knocked my mirrors in, which I felt shouldn't happen, and the WORST part-- at the end... NOTHING! Basically you drive through the thing, and there's NO one to even DRY your car when it's all done. I'm not looking for a wax and a buff, but come on. It left water spots ALL over my car, and I had to go get it washed somewhere else. I went to Wash Wizard, which is MUCH closer to me and I got pretty much a full service wash for only $7, and there was no abrasive scrubbing. Much better value in my personal opinion.

I love this place!!  Granted, I've only tried their spinach&artichoke dip and their fish&chips, but golly both of those are DELICIOUS. They've got a great drinks selection, and the dining setting is really unique and welcoming. They've got loads of TVs, so it's got a cool sports-bar feel, but more restaurant-y if that makes any sense.  I need to check out their happy hour as it includes a GIANT chunk of their menu at a great rate!   Also they've got an agreement with the movie theater in the center. On Mondays, you can get a brick-oven pizza of your choice (normally 11.95-12.95), two non-alcoholic beverages, and two Harkins Theatres tickets for ONLY $19.95! If you're going to a Monday movie, you can't beat it.

While I feel as though Tempe is GREATLY lacking in the car wash department, I feel as though this place really is as good as you're going to find in the area. (check out my review for "Clean Freak Car Wash" on 44th).   Their most expensive wash is $8, $7 if you have an ASU (or any university?) ID. Not only does the drive-through give you everything you need, you have people IN the drive-through working on your car at the same time. They have people to scrub your car down in the middle, and to dry it off at the end. You even get a complimentary air freshener!  They really take the time to make sure every area of your car is PERFECTLY clean and dry, and won't let you leave until you are happy. Wash Wizard is the ONLY place I will get my car washed from here on in. I might go back to Clean Freak one or two more times just to get my money's worth (I stupidly signed up for their monthly package and can't cancel it until next month). But I'll always come back to these guys.

This place was mediocre. The people were nice enough, but I'm not going back here.  Tip: BRING YOUR OWN NAIL POLISH! Their selection is WEAK. They have so few polish colours to choose from, that it's not worth it to go unless you bring your own.  I asked for a mani-pedi, which I got. Their massage chairs were nice, but I went through my entire pedicure waiting for the extra stuff I asked for (I had asked for their "best" pedicure off the menu) and it never came! FINALLY, I asked about it and he said that he "forgot" and thought I wanted a different package. I was pretty clear with what I wanted but I guess he didn't think so. Basically I paid and left. If I were them, I would have offered a discount on my next pedicure, seeing as I didn't get what I wanted this time, but whatever.   I'm trying Jeniza next time, I've heard good things.
