My friend and I went to see the Lakers play the Suns at the US Airways Center. I love that the center is surrounded by lots of great bars and restaurants. It is a 2 minute walk from the light rail drop off - VERY convenient.  The arena is on the small side. I would say maybe 1/2 the size of Staples Center in Los Angeles.  I sat  in the 200 section and I was 8 rows from the back wall so it's quite small and you pretty much have a decent view.  I was shocked to see that 40% of their fans were wearing Lakers gear - I didn't realize Phoenix had a lot of transplants.  I can't say that the stadium is the best out there but it was nice.

My friend who lives in Phoenix told me that finding really good asian food is a difficult task.  While I was visiting she told me she finally found a great Japanese restaurant. We went over the weekend and I must agree that it was up to par and I grew up eating authentic Japanese food at home.  The have a very good happy hour Monday thru Friday from 3 to 6pm. The rolls and a few dishes along with alcohol are priced anywhere from $2-$5. I suggest you get there early. We got there around 5:15 and had an hour wait. We didn't make it for happy hour so we ordered off the regular menu.  I had hot Soba (buckwheat noodle) soup and Tofu Salad. The Soba soup was very good, I would skip the tofu salad next time, there wasn't anything special about it.   We also shared the Alaskan roll which comprised of cooked salmon, crab, cucumber and avocado. It was really good.   For those of you who have never had Japanese style Italian food, it's quite a treat. If you can imagine Italian pasta with a twist such as soy sauce flavor, etc., it's something everyone who enjoy Japanese flavors should check out.  We also noticed the dessert counter and decided to order a few things to go.  I got the strawberry shortcake - which is a very popular dessert in Japan and they made it perfectly.  Pound cake type sponge, fresh strawberry, light cream and overall not too sweet. My friend tried the chocolate tart and it was soooooooooooooooo good!  Check it out if you live in the area!

THE BEST OMELETTE I'VE EVER HAD!!!!  Saturday Brunch Review.  You can custom make your own omelette. My friend who is a regular ordered mine for me. Her concoction consisted of bacon, ham, cheese, sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, and pesto.  Wow, it was hands-down the best omelette I've ever had.The price was reasonable at about $10.  The next time I'm back visiting Phoenix, Vincent's On Camelback is on my list of places to re-visit..

How can I give a restaurant anything higher than 2 stars when they serve burnt hashbrowns (I posted a picture). It looked fine when they brought it over but as I was eating it, it tasted really weird so I looked on the bottom and it was BLACK!.  I don't know how a chef/cook can ever serve anyone something so burnt. I wouldn't even care if had a little burn on the edge but this thing was ALL black and it was awful.  Never in my life have I been served something like that.   My friend had the crepe which I tasted and it was really good. She also ordered the country potato over the hashbrown which was a good move for her.   After I complained they brought back a hot new order of hashbrown but it took a while (about 15 minutes) and they didn't seem too apologetic so I wasn't very pleased. I have no plans to go back!

Packed on a Monday evening!! I think we waited about a half hour.    Sangria!!! Firefly is a tapas bar located off the strip but absolutely worth the drive or taxi ride for those who enjoy awesome food, drinks and atmosphere. Sometimes it's nice to get off the strip away from all the gambling and tourists.  Food and service were also great! -Ceviche - very tasty. -Thai Beef Salad - this might have been my favorite dish. -Empanada - good! -Bacon Wrapped Dates - a must.  The three of us shared a pitcher of Sangria It's as good as the Sangria I make at home...which is really good!! We had a great time!

I'm an amateur when it comes to food trucks but my friend took me a spot that had 10 trucks parked for a weekday lunch. I chose to eat Filipino food and it was really good. The price is on the high side for it not being a sit down restaurant.  I had the pancit noodles and the lumpia and they were delicious. If you enjoy good Filipino food or you've never tried it, this is a good place to go.

Great breakfast/brunch spot with a nice pet-friendly outdoor patio.    I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was PACKED.  You order at the counter, they give you a  "letter" to place on your table and someone will bring you the food (a bit like corner bakery). I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was really good...not too heavy. Great location and ambiance.

I had some time to kill before my flight out of the Phoenix Airport so I decided to try out the breakfast sandwich at Great Steak.  I had the beef egg sandwich which was actually really good - it's pretty much a philly cheese steak sandwich with eggs on a smaller round bun. My complaint about this mainly about the worker who was behind the counter cooking. It was about 9:58am when I stepped up to order, I think at 10am they stop serving breakfast and he kept complaining to the order taker to stop taking breakfast order. The way he was whining and talking very loud not only held up the line but made the customers uncomfortable.  He kept saying "she's the last one, she can order a sandwich but no potatoes" the other lady working behind the counter said it was fine, I can order potatoes to go with my sandwich. The girl behind me wanted breakfast too and the cook guy kept saying that she definitely has to be the last one. I don't understand how breakfast could end so abruptly and I'm only allowed to order the sandwich and not the combo.  The guy was rude and he may have been getting off shift because when I looked up again it was someone else cooking.  It's unfortunate because inside an airport you only have so many options, I wish the airport has some sort of say with the business inside so that travelers can have a good experience as a whole.

Located in the same plaza as Flavors of India, I highly recommend checking out mint nails spa for a few specific reasons I'd like to mention.  1) no parking issues 2) great, friendly staff (which is not always the case at nail salons) 3) they use top notch organic products that are not tested on animals 4) you can relax, they aren't pushing you out the door, you can get a whole experience in (pedicures last about an hour!)  I was in town visiting friends when I decided to get a pedicure because my feet looked awful. I found mint on yelp and decided to check it out. I really love helping small businesses and this is definitely one we should all support. The owner really cares and it's obvious she put her heart and soul into her business. I suggest you go online to make an appointment or call because they do get busy.   What I loved the most was the nail polish colors they offered. They were beautiful... These are things I rarely rave about. It wasn't Opi, I actually think their polish is a step up because the quality was good and the colors aren't boring.   If you care about animals, the environment and the quality of products salons are using, you should definitely come here. I'm far from being an activist but when I can, I try to make my contribution to mother earth... And the great service is an added bonus.

The outdoor patio is a nice touch. They also have a decent draft beer selection so I am giving them 2 stars vs 1.    What I wasn't a fan of was the service starting with the gal who seated us to the lack of personality our server had.  The food was also ok...nothing special. As someone visiting a friend in town, i left unimpressed...my friend who is a local said that she would only go for convenience as its located close to her home.    They need to train their staff to provide better service.
