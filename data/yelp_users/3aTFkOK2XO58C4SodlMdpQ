First off... their Horchata is phenomenal - and would be the only reason I'd probably step foot back into Robertos.  Also, I was told that the margarita was fairly decent.  Other than that... everything else that we had was pretty "meh".  My mom was in town, and craving Mexican, so we decided to try Roberto's out from the Yelp reviews - I kind of wish we wouldn't have.  For starters, we were told we'd be brought chips and salsa... but they never came.  We waited a good 45 minutes to get any food, which seems crazy to me to make people wait for 45 minutes for some food served on disposable plates with plastic silverware in an environment that looks like there are serving up fast food.  And then to make people wait that long and not even bring them chips and salsa.  Not great on the service standpoint.  As far as the food goes, my husband ordered the Al Pastor burrito - he said it was bland and greasy, definitely not anything close to what he is used to (and he said that the Al Pastor could have benefited greatly from some pineapple, which I believe it is traditionally served with).  My dad ordered the rellano combo plate, which he said was good, but definitely not the best he has ever had... maybe typical middle road.  My mom ordered the enchilada and taco combo - she didn't like the enchilada at all and only ate some of the chicken out of the inside of the taco - definitely didn't satisfy her mexican food craving.  I ordered the chicken chimi combo, which was really bland and typical - nothing special or that I'd want to eat again.  We all discussed that the beans were pretty good, but that does not a meal make.  So to have to wait that long and then be completely underwhelmed by bland mexican food... not likely that we'll be returning, unless of course in the area and craving some horchata.

My husband and I came to Deseo on a date night and enjoyed the 3-course pre-fix meal. We tried 2 different kinds of sashimi (the lobster and the rainbow) for the first course, which were so fresh and vibrant.  For our second course we ordered the skirt steak and the lamb, both of which blew us away with the flavor.  All of the items we ordered were fresh, perfectly prepared, and I'm sure we will have cravings for them down the road!  We also ordered an additional side of the crab "tostada" rice, which was good, but I don't know that I would order that particular side dish again as it seemed to be lacking crab.  My only real complaint regarding the meal would be the desserts... we tried one of each and they just seemed a little lackluster after such outstanding other courses. I would definitely eat here again and am glad to see many of the hotels now putting their best foot forward with the restaurants that they house.

We love Binkley's... and Kevin is an absolute genius with food! My husband and I have so far been here twice since we've moved to Arizona and have thoroughly enjoyed both meals. The tasting menus are a great way to experience the food, and I highly recommend doing the wine pairings which are thoughtfully chosen. By far one of my favorite items that I've had at Binkley's was a sweet corn and crab chowder... I'd eat that every day if I could!  I also loved adding a truffled fondue to one of our tastings.  My husband enjoys seeing which kind of wild game Kevin is serving up, and I think his favorite so far has been a wild boar.  Beyond the yummy food, the service and knowledge of the more experience staff is outstanding.  While the service of the younger kids can be somewhat disorganized, I do appreciate the Binkley's is willing to hire kids from the area and it makes the meal not so intimidating unlike some of the Michelin-star restaurants whose service can be stuffy. If you've been thinking about trying Binkley's but haven't yet, I would highly encourage you to head up to Cave Creek to see what all the reviews are about! It has definitely been added to our favorite list!

My husband and I are fairly recent transplants to the Valley and I'd been given a recommendation to check this place out for sushi.  I'll start out by saying that the service was good and the sashimi that we order was fresh.  After that it pretty much goes down hill.  We spent $80 just on sushi, and both of us left there hungry.  Steep prices are met by skimpy amounts of fish.  The only normal sized item we were served was the salmon sashimi.  One of our appetizers was yellowtail, and for $18 we were served 6 tiny slivers of tuna.  The rolls, while I particularly enjoyed that they were the perfect bite sized amounts and looked pretty when it was served, primarily consisted of rice.  Sorry, but a mouthful of rice is not what I'm looking for when spending $15+ on a roll.  I'd actually like to have SOME fish in the roll.  Everything but the sashimi pretty much lacked flavor and character.  They touted when we got there that it was authentic Japanese, well, I hate to tell them it is far from it!  Just because you have a very limited selection on your menu doesn't mean it is authentic Japanese.  I've had sushi in Japan... and the Japanese would scoff at what was presented to us.    If you want to pay for a "yuppy" Scottsdale vibe, then this is your place.  But if you actually want fish with your sushi and to be fulfilled when you're done eating... I'd keep looking because Roka Akor doesn't cut it.

We are thrilled to have found a pretty good sushi restaurant that is somewhat close to our neighborhood!  We were welcomed and seated promptly!  Waters were brought very quickly, along with a Kirin and Sochu!  Even the sushi was pretty fast.  The first thing that came out was our salmon sashimi!  I looked great, the slices were of good size, and was super fresh!  Great start!  Then we received our order of Heart Attack.  Tempura fried fresh jalapeno stuffed with crab, spicy tuna and cream cheese.  Again, another winner!  The next thing to come out was the Philly roll.  I must say that this is a different version than I'm used to, so was a little curious about if I'd like it or not.  Both my husband and I agreed that we liked it better than the standard traditional Philly roll.  The inside is cream cheese, cucumber and asparagus with the salmon on the outside.  Not only do you get more cream cheese this way, but also more salmon!  Definitely one we'd re-order again.  This was followed by the Spicy Tuna Crunchy roll.  Again, a different take on the typical spicy tuna roll.  This one didn't so much pay off.  Both my husband and I agreed that we like the traditional version, and would try to order it without the "crunchy" in the future.  While it wasn't bad by any means, it left a lot to be desired in terms of the freshness and spice you get from a traditional Spicy Tuna.  And we rounded out our sushi experience with the baked Scallop Roll.  Scallops and crab on top of a Cali roll, that it baked with some tasty sauces drizzled on top.  Reminds me of one of my favorite rolls that I always used to get before moving to Arizona, and have never found it anywhere since.  I must say that while it wasn't a duplicate of my favorite, it was pretty close and definitely tasty!  We will definitely be making Yen a repeat when we are wanting sushi!

Ah-So Sad is what this place should be called.  We'd read the Yelp reviews before we went but were really, really hoping to like it as it is the ONLY sushi joint in this area.  We had called in our reservation prior and were seated right away... so it was off to a good start.  And yes, the decor is very multiple personality... but I could care less if they have good food.  We waited for a few minutes for our server, then a few more minutes for our waters and a long while for our beers.  The sushi combo's seemed somewhat odd, but we figured we'd give them a shot.  Lots and lots of tempuras in the rolls, which is not my thing... if I'm ordering sushi I was fresh fish... not a bunch of fried foods.  So we ended up ordering a Sunset Roll, a Spicy Tuna Roll, a Surprise Dynamite Roll, and order of Yellowtail Nigiri and an order of the Sake (Salmon) Sashimi.  We waited forever for the waitress to bring out our miso soup, which she actually spilled a lot of my husbands as she was walking away and didn't check, apologize, or anything... just walked away.  The soup was your run of the mill miso and thank goodness she brought it out  because we then had to wait WAY to long for our sushi.  While waiting for our sushi, I noticed one of the other servers attempt to deliver our sushi to two other tables, before finally deciding she didn't know where it went, took it back up to the window to sit and walked off.  I did notice she told our server the order was up, at which point our waitress took off to the kitchen.  So were are sitting there at our table looking at our food on top of the sushi counter... wondering where our waitress was.  At one point I almost got up to go get it.  10 minutes later our waitress finally emerges from the kitchen, gets our sushi, brings it to us, and casually asks us, "Everything okay?" and then walks off.  It wasn't much to look at, but hungry... we dig in.  My husband never has a problem with eating sushi... usually I'm the one that makes the mess, but every single roll we tried fell apart.  This was bad sign number one that this place doesn't know what they're doing when it comes to making a sushi roll.  And the hits kept coming... #2:  our spicy tuna roll was basically chopped tuna and wasabi = not a real spicy tuna roll.  If a place cannot even make a spicy tuna roll it is a bad sign.  The sunset roll was the best out of all of the rolls we ordered, but I noticed that they don't use real crab... it is all imitation here.  The Surprise Dynamite roll was quite bland and my husband mentioned that it was really dry for a roll that has sauce and is baked... and again was filled with imitation Krab.  Our nigiri and sashimi were good, but this day in age with shipping and the ability to be able to get fish anywhere and anytime... you really cannot screw this one up.    All in all... the rolls were pretty tragic and sad.  Use of imitation Krab is not okay especially when the prices were inflated.  And the prices of our rolls, but especially the nigiri and sashimi was ridiculous (and not in the good way) considering how little we were given.  Any other sushi place we've visited when ordering that much we are stuffed upon leaving, here we actually decided we were both still hungry so when to get some fro-yo elsewhere.  And service... well, that definitely has room for lots of improvement as well.

We initially went because my husband had wanted to try out this little gastropub and is a huge fans a trying a variety of beers.  And we've returned because I fell head over heels in "food heaven" with their Shrimp and Risotto dish!  Beautiful, large shrimp are wrapped in bacon and grilled.  They are then placed on a bed of a lemon risotto that has the perfect balance of freshness from the lemon and comfort from the cheesy goodness.  There are splashes of truffle oil, balsamic glaze and some other sauce that make this dish a total delight!  My husband typically orders the burger, and said that it is a good and satisfying when you're looking for an All-American burger on a good roll.  I've also tried the lamb, which to me was just okay, and I probably wouldn't order it again.  We've had friends order the flatbread pizzas and the wings and all said they were really good too!  We ordered the bread pudding once too off of our servers recommendation, and it was different than most bread puddings, but really good.  The service tends to be hit or miss... so be aware of that.  You'll probably be pretty upset if you're really into excellent service... it hasn't been awful, but it can be inconsistent (we've had really good, one average, and one that was terrible).  Some nights tend to be really busy, so I'd avoid that as it seems that any service goes straight down the tubes.  But, since I'm hooked on their shrimp and risotto... I will return whether the service is great or just ho-hum.  And my husband really seems to enjoy the beers, while the selection isn't huge, he has really liked what he's had!

CPH is amazing! We have never had a bad meal there.  We have tried a few of their salads, including the Chopped, Fernet Steak, and local field greens, all if which were good.  We also tried the Pork Belly Pastrami appetizer, which they have received numerous reviews on, and it was delicious.  My husband LOVES the short ribs in the coffee rub.  My absolute favorite is the scallops.  They are fresh and cooked properly, and are paired with some wilted greens, corn grits and a cola gastrique sauce.  The whole combination is amazing!  We are normally stuffed, so have only tried dessert once, but it was incredible as well.  We ordered the apple pie in a cheddar cheese crust, and it was by far the best apple pie I have ever tried.  We love Citizen Public House and will continue to call it one of our favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area!

The fish was pretty fresh and the rolls were the perfect size to be able to fit into your mouth without looking like a blowfish... but it was just missing that... something.  We tried a large spread of appetizers, sashimi and rolls...  it was good, but it wasn't great.  I'll only comment on a few of the things we ordered to give the gist:  The spicy tuna wasn't spicy at all.  The shrimp on the rainbow roll tasted a little old and chewy.  Most of their rolls with crab have imitation Krab, which they don't tell you, but you can figure it out based upon the prices of the roll that has real crab and specifically states it is real crab.  Our server forgot to bring out miso soup all together, so I don't know how that is.  The crab rangoon was pretty good and had a great sauce.  The yellowtail and jalapeno appetizer missed the mark... I've had it before in other places where it was amazing, so this was a little disappointing.  And the Philly roll had no cucumber and was pretty much all cream cheese, which while I like a good amount, not being able to taste the salmon or anything else isn't appealing.  Some of the pieces of fish were pretty good sized, while others were very lacking - there seemed to be an inconsistency.  If I were in the neighborhood and really hungry for sushi, I might try it again as the prices were pretty decent and they seemed to have a local following, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there for sushi as the experience was a little underwhelming.

I came here with my husband and parents to celebrate my birthday.  We arrived a little earlier than our reservation time, but the restaurant was not busy at all yet, so they seated us promptly.  We started with the Crostino Di Proscuitto and the Fried Calamari.  The Crostino was just okay - I felt like I could have done a better job making it at home.  The calamari was good - they were not overbreaded and had a nice light fry to make the batter crunchy, but not make the calamari rubbery. My family members then ordered the veal, pasta trio, and eggplant torta with butternut squash ravioli.  Everyone seemed to like their meal.  I had a bite of the butternut squash ravioli and thought it was really tasty.  I had ordered a sea bass, which was unfortunately not a good piece of fish.  After my first bite I knew it was a piece of bad fish, and was not about to eat the rest and be sick on my birthday.  The lentil side that came with the fish was AMAZING, so it was unfortunate to get such a bad piece of fish.  However, as soon as the chef was notified that I had received some bad fish, he came out personally, took it away, apologized and discussed what I would like as a replacement.  I ended up not wanting to chance another piece of fish, so I ordered the hazelnut risotto.  It was really great, and I have no complaints about it and would order it again in a heartbeat!  The chef came out after that and checked on us repeatedly to make sure we were all satisfied with our meals.  He also went above and beyond and served us all with a 4 course sampling of desserts, which was a wonderful birthday treat and his way of apologizing for the fish.  The staff was great and I appreciated the the chef was so dedicated to making it a good birthday for me. I will definitely be back to try out some more of Tommy V's offerings.
