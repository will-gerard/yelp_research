I had to show the ad to multiple people. The sale items is buried in the stock room none are on the sales floor. The other item is on the sales floor but not marketed with the sale price. I have been waiting 20 minutes for a manager to find them.

So disappointed I used to go to a Pong Pong up on Bell Road that had great sesame chicken. I was excited when I saw a Pong Pong in my friends neighborhood. The food sucked. The egg roll was saturated in oil like the fryer was not hot enough. The crab puff had cream cheese in just one corner. The hot and sour soup had an odd flavor and the sesame chicken was bland, the breading was soft not crisp and most of the chicken was tough. This was a one time experience.

I would have enjoyed my moo shu pork if the pork itself had been remotely warm. I was suspicious when it came out prerolled and not prepared table side. The waitress offered to have it remade but the owner came out and refused to remake it just to take it off the bill. So I said I guess I can go without dinner tonight. Really not impressed really not happy with the lack of customer service. Will never go back.

Ehh ordered Irish nachos arrived Luke warm not much cheese sauce and the seasoned ground beef was bland and clumpy. Not really a meal I would want to repeat. Really sorry I didn't complain when they came out in asked for more cheese sauce and was informed it's an up charge.

Beavers Choice is a bad choice. I had wanted to try this place for ages. I finally got the chance to go tonight and WILL NEVER GO AGAIN. It started OK the complimentary perogies they brought out were crisp and hot. I got the all you could eat perogies and the soup was great the Swedish coleslaw was OK the perogies were cold and nasty. My friend ordered flying Johnny. It is the nastiest mess of chicken, bananas, one lone peanut and a nasty sweet tomato sauce the kindest comparison is the sauce on canned ravioli. The only high light was the side of beet salad. The waiter never checked back on us and we had to have another waiter take away the flying Johnny. It was not removed from the bill and my friend was not offered to order something else. Over all a very disappointing experience. Inattentive service, cold or yuck tasting food. Don't bother going.

Our server Ben rocked. He was polite sweet and attentive. He even tied our bibs on for us. The fried calamari was incredible tender and sweet exactly as it should be. The fried clams were a little chewy but still tasty.  We both got the special the angry treasure a mix of snow crab legs, shrimp, mussels and veggies. It was yum. Definitely will come back.  The only FYI it is a loud happy place great for a party but not for intimate moment.
