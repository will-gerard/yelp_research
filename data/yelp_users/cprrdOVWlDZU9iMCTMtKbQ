This my friends, is the long time home of the Best Chicago style Italian Beef Sandwich in Phoenix !   What in the dickens makes a good Italian Beef Sandwich? Well, it depends on who you ask to a certain extent.   My unbiased opinion of what makes this the perfect sandwich, starts with in house, slow cooked, thinly sliced, Beef, with a blend of Italian spices and it's own natural juices. You add that to the perfect type of roll that is dipped in those juices, a slice of provolone cheese is added to the steaming beef and roll, then top it off with house made giardinara, made of Zucchini, Olives, Serrano Chilies, Carrots, and Olive Oil, and boom....There you have it! Top it off, by pouring a cup of the beef stock over the sandwich before you put your bib on and create a dam of napkins on the table for the inevitable mess that the authentic sandwich is going to create. ;)   Note to those who get all hurt and flustered about the house made giardanara because they use Serrano chilies, they do offer the pickled giardanara as an alternative option as well. So don't shoot them down before you go and give the place a shot.   The fries are crispy on the outside and like a mashed potato on the inside.   The Polish, and Brat are real sausage links from their own supplier, not the crappy hotdog like sausages that you get from a hotdog stand on the street of a crappy neighborhood or from a place like Lobby's in Tempe.   The only thing that sometimes throws off the consistent experience for me, is that at times when I ask for a side of the beef stock, it isn't stirred before they dish it up, and it has a thick layer of oil in the cup, rather than the aqueous layer beneath which contains all of the flavor. This is something that they could take as a constructive criticism at times.  The only other establishment that serves up a perfected version of this beef sandwich is the owners brother who just opened up Chicago's Taylor Street. He was the best maker of theses sandwiches at Lukes for years, and recently opened up his own spot. It's great to see some competition in this Valley, especially with a couple of brothers competing with eachother. It should help keep the standards high, which should create a good product for us.  Try out both of these spots and write an according review to spark up the competition to the two current greats in the Valley of the Sun.  Cheers! :)

This place is a hidden gem and should not be overlooked if you want the best Italian Sub in town!  What is an Italian Sub?  Well, most places sell you a sandwich that is packed with a cheap cut of meat, such as Capicola, then maybe a few slices of Salami, and if you are super lucky, you might get a slice of Prosciutto, which will bring the cost of the sub to at least $10.  At Tony's, they offer the standard Italian sub on their menu, but they allow you to customize it to your liking. An Italian sub, is whatever you want it to be..you choose your cuts of Italian meats, and it's a done deal. I often get Prosciutto, Sopressata, and Salami, and they don't skimp on the quantity of meat either.  If I were to take the Prosciutto off the sandwich, have them weigh it, and buy just the meat, it would cost more than the entire sandwich does. This is one of the nice things about a family business, they take care of their customers. The bread is authentic, and the flavor of the quality meats really make for an authentic, flavorful, Italian Sub. The best part, is that it only costs about $6.00, which is unbelievable.  If you aren't looking for authenticity, then this is not the place for you. Authentic is the key word here, and I think that some of the negative reviews I have seen are due to ignorance and not understanding what it takes to run a business of this type in this part of town for so many years.  They have one of the biggest selections of imported Italian groceries that I have seen in town. They have everything from fresh bread to dry and frozen pasta, to sauces, imported peppers, fresh made Italian Sausages, which are amazing as well. The store is packed with goods, and there may be a little dust on some cans here or there, but come on, it's an old family business with a huge amount of authentic, imported goods. These places are what you want to have around when you want groceries that you only find in the Old World or in big cities, such as San Fran or New York City.  This business has so much more to offer and I urge anyone who appreciates authenticity and a good down to earth, family owned and operated business to check this place out and write a review that is fair and that applies to the type of business. This place should not be compared to a typical grocery store, or Subway, it's more like an under appreciated, awesome dive bar, but instead, an Italian Grocery Store...lol   I know that the right people know what I'm trying to say. :)  The bottom line is, keep this hidden gem in business, and then post some deserving reviews on here!  Cheers! :)

So I visited Ton'y Italian Deli on three separate occasions recently. Each time was a real treat! I feel that I really need to try to drive the Yelper's who appreciate quality, authentic, simple, old world food to make stop at this place.  if you aren't cultured, and do not appreciate the simplicity of old world food, then steer clear and don't waste your time writing a negative review due to your ignorance.  To be a qualified reviewer, you must first have an understanding of what it is that you are reviewing. Unfortunately, a great majority of the younger generation in this semi-metropolis have not had the cultural exposure that many of their own age in old school and well cultured cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, or New York City have grown up in and around.  With that being said, old world, simple dishes, made with simple ingredients and a whole lot of love are often under-appreciated. I urge you to research the importance of things such as bread, cured meats and olives, peppers, homemade sausages, etc. in the old world countries, and even well cultured US Cities.  A physical location that has been around for 30 years in this town that serves up old world cuisine, at an old world price, with a ton of love from the family who has been there from the start deserves a certain respect for those qualities alone.  It is apparent to me that the typical American these days, seems to consider a true sandwich incomplete without Mayo or Mustard. The truth is, that those two additions are fine, but your tongue is uncultured. A true sub should not have such ingredients to cover up the subtle flavors of the cured meats and cheese. A little oil and vinegar add the zing that Ashley C. was speaking of. Again, no disrespect to her lack of knowledge, but knowledge and understanding are power and lead to a well rounded palette.   The sandwiches are only one small item in the full spectrum of this old world rarity, in a not so favorable part of town. The fact is, that this part of town may be a couple of miles out of your daily travels, but it is only a hop, skip, and a jump off the 51.  Any true Yelper who appreciates the few, true Phoenix greats who sometimes fall into the unknown needs to make their way to this abode and see what you think and how you feel. If you feel the way that I do, then I think that the weight that I currently have on my shoulders about helping this quality place to stay afloat, will transcend to you and our team efforts will unite to get these old school purveyors back in the spotlight that they deserve to be in.  Let's keep the growth of true culture and diversity alive in this town before it ends up like Old Town Scottsdale. There, you have a bunch of places with different names and decor, but the majority of the same food and lack of culture or ambiance are spreading like a wildfire that is depleting true cultural experiences and the small and simple places that don't get the love and appreciation that they deserve.   Forget the fancy menus with a fancy plate made in China, you can find that anywhere and they are in a completely different market. Take yourself back into a different time and into a different culture, it will make life more enjoyable and you will be more appreciative of the things that you have this day in age, as well as the roots that the things of this day evolved from. it's like thanking your parents or grandparents for the wisdom that they gave you. :)  Cheers!

I stumbled upon this restaurant when performing a Yelp search for Ceviche in Mesa the other day.  I was a little skeptical due to some of the low ratings, but we decided to enter the humble looking venue, in the primitive looking strip mall.  We were immediately greeted and seated by a lovely hostess / server. She was extremely attentive and informative, as we were not familiar with Pupusas or much of the other Salvadorian Cuisine.  We ordered and shared the Shrimp Ceviche, which was garnished with fresh Avocado and Cucumbers. The freshly fried tortilla chips were very tasty, and the ceviche was a little more on the sweet side vs. the typical intense lime flavor. It was very fresh tasting, and we both really enjoyed it.  We were given a lesson in what Pupusas are, and asked our lovely waitress to pick three of her favorite choices and send them out. She chose Carne Asada, Chicharon with beans, and the last one was not quite identified, but was very tasty.  Before bringing out the Pupusas, she dropped off a small bowl of a red sauce, and a bowl of spicy cabbage, which were meant to be used as toppings for the Pupusas.  We both thought that the Pupusas were very simple, yet tasty. The spicy cabbage and red sauce as toppings really added flavor to the Pupusas.  We were impressed with what we perceived to be authentic Salvadorian Cuisine, so we ordered one last dish.   We had to try the fried Plantains, served with a black bean sauce, and Crema. The plantains were fried to perfection with nice caramelization. The black bean sauce was interesting, and the cream was a little on the salty side, rather than sweet as I would have expected. It is small details such as these which led us to believe that the food was authentic.  Don't let the other reviews mislead you if you are looking for a fresh, authentic experience.   If you want a fancy location with beer and wine, then forget about it. This place is all about giving an authentic, down to earth, culinary experience to those who seek quality without the distraction of interior design.  :)

From the atmosphere to the food, to the entire staff at Kazimierz, it's a well orchestrated entertainment establishment.  Kazimierz has a fine selection of Wines and Alcoholic beverages that you just won't find elsewhere. From the Framboise on tap, to the Bison Grass infused Vodka, Kazimierz is a true diamond in the rough.  The bar itself can be a little tricky to find at first. It truly does have the look and feel of an old speak easy, with an almost hidden entrance. When you enter through the unapparent door, the dark and low lit ambiance takes over, as you make your way to the bar or to one of the comfortable couches with your group of friends.  The bar staff is very knowledgeable, friendly, and down to earth. Charlie and Eric make quite the team. Charlie has a giant mustache and looks like a barkeep that you would expect to see on a Stella Artoise commercial. Eric is just an all around cool dude with a good sense of humor and a vast knowledge of the company products. Chris is a little quieter, but still has the charm that could pull the fleas from a dogs back. Jason runs around like a mad man, and makes sure that things run smooth and efficient, and will crack a decent joke upon request. As for the wonderful ladies, the place would be nothing without their classy service.   The food menu is very creative and the presentation and execution of the dishes is very well done.   The three cheese Fondue, served with sliced apples and cubes of bread is just plain comfort food. The Cuban Pretzel Crisis is a great dish as well. It consists of pretzel bread sandwiches with Prosciutto, and some other great stuff, along with some house made potato chips.  If you order the Olives, you get close to one whole pound of olives for $6.00. It's cheaper than the olive bar at the grocery store. They have weekly food specials, and so many things to comment about.  Thursday nights are probably the best night of anywhere in this entire town. For $5.00 you get to enjoy Dennis Rowland, who is a Grammy Award Winning Jazz Entertainer. I must say, he is quite the entertainer, and you better watch out because he might just sweep your lady off of her feet. He is one of the most talented performers that I have seen anywhere in this town. I am surprised that more people aren't aware of this hidden treat.  In a nutshell, Kazimierz is hands down, the best spot in Old Town Scottsdale if you aren't a 21 to 40 year old doucher!  Whether you're flying solo and have the blues, or you have a significant other and want a quaint joint with great atmosphere and ambiance, stop in for one of the greatest experiences that you can possibly enjoy in Old Town Scottsdale.

It is what it is....... It's the oldest bar in Old Town Scottsdale, and has the coolest year round light show of anywhere else in the neighborhood.  They do sell Slim Jim's and bags of chips, but nothing more as far as food is concerned...lol  They have cheap drinks, a small indoor area with a Juke Box, many characters, and during the Holidays, it looks like a spectacle of lights that you would only expect to see in a psyhadelic vision or in a Chevy Chase movie. :)  It is a social spot that attracts old timers at 6AM on Sundays, along with those who are deep in the realms of paranoia from a lack of sleep the night before. It is a place to indulge in a psychadelic sunrise, and take the edge off when in one of those vulnerable and unclear states of mind.  It welcomes all walks of life, both straight edge, and those who have fallen off the cliff.  Check it out if you are into that sort of thing.  They do what they have done for the entire history of the place and they do it well.  So go indulge, don't expect much, and have a good time!   Cheers =)

Gary does it right. After being in business for 47 years in the same location, he has seen and been through it all.  You can't beat the price for the culinary experience in the area, not to mention the social aspect and people watching at times.  I can't tell you how many times I passed by this place over the past 8 years and never stopped in. I had no idea what I was missing out on until earlier this year, when I stopped in for a dinner party with Jesse J. and some friends.  It was only at this time that I realized what this place really has to offer.  From the Sausage Parmesan, to the Chicken Carolina, to the Veal Scallopini, I have yet to try anything that wasn't up to my standard of excellence. The Mussels Portofino are amazing, not fishy tasting whatsoever. I am always skeptical of Shellfish in AZ, and usually not a fan of Mussels, but they have been fresh on every occasion here. The same goes for the clams, they are as fresh as can be. The house vinagrette that is served on the salad before your meal is tasty, and i can guarantee that you won't find one leaf of brown or wilted lettuce in your salad. :)  As for the bar, Chris the bartender on the weekends really adds a nice touch to the place. He comes off as being down to business and straight to the point, as you would expect to encounter on the east coast. He will crack a smile once in a while and will chat it up with you it you start the conversation. You will often times see Gary, the owner walking around making sure that all of his guests are being properly taken care of.  The decor in the place really illustrates how long this place has been around, and when you try the food or chat with Gary or one of the other old school staff members, you will feel like you have stepped into an NYC hole in the wall Italian Joint for the night.  Whether you're looking for a great meal at a reasonable price with a laid back, yet classy atmosphere, or if you're just passing by and grab a drink at the bar, it's a sure bet that you will leave with a smile on your face, and maybe a little history on the place or the town.  Treat yourself to an old school piece of Scottsdale history and have a nice New York Italian Style meal at The Grotto.

This place has great decor and some smokin servers from time to time, but the food and prices have been a disappointment on every occasion.  I can't tell you how many times I have given this place a chance over the past 4 or more years. On some occasions we were there for a birthday, and on other occasions just to grab a quick bite.  The dishes which contain chicken breast have always been overcooked and very dry. As for the Sushi rolls, they are far from the best, and certainly nothing special. On occasion they have a rendition of ceviche or a squid salad which both sound promising. Once again on each occasion, the presentation was there, but the portions were very small, certainly didn't taste like anything that was satisfying, and the price tag was insulting for what we had.  The only reason that I go to this place at all now, is to grab a quick drink if I'm walking around the area.  This is one of those places that creates the stereotypical Scottsdale image, just as RA does just up the street. It's a place to say that you ate at if you want to be a stereotypical, brain dead, Scottsdale doucher. The fact that you consider it to be the best means one of the following:  1.) You were extremely fortunate and your food was prepared and presented to perfection.  2.) You have no idea what good sushi consists of, and are probably a huge fan of California, Las Vegas, or Godzilla rolls.  or  3.) You are a young blonde bombshell with no brain who thinks that it's cool to eat Sushi because you are a sheep and think that everything that you see on 'Keeping up with the Kardashian's' is what real life is all about. (or because you watch some other BS show on MTV and are influenced by the complete ass hats with no brains).  Either way, this place is typically a terrible place to go and eat if you want to enjoy good Sushi, Sashimi, etc.  They do have a nicely decorated interior and sit at a nice location in old town.  If you're dating a younger girl with her head in the clouds she will love this place! =)  Sorry for the rant and ill painted picture, you can see that I'm over the Scottsdale illusion and have no tolerance for it...  If you are in the area, I would hit Kyoto or Pearl before this place, but a quick drive to Missouri and 7th ave will get you the best Sushi experience with a decent price tag.  Cheers and much luv! =)  FYI...I'm certainly not hating on blonde females, I love them to death as long as they don't fit into that superficial stereotype.

I feel that I was misled by the high rating of this establishment. I was very disappointed, and rarely say such a thing.... I hate to be the one to do it, but other Yelpers need to know what they are getting into with this place.  The concept sounds great on paper, and I'm certain that it could work well if executed properly, but they have a great deal of culinary improvements to make before they will get any approval from me.  The employees who explained the menu were very friendly people, but the quality of the food, was completely lacking in my opinion.  The majority of the chicken dishes seem to consist of breaded, deep fried, chicked bites, each with a different choice of sauce, and then served over rice which is cooked in a choice of styles or sauces. It is similar to the orange Chicken at Panda Express, but extremely dry and very low quality.  We ordered three diffferent types of their employee recommended chicken and rice dishes, and they all tasted very similar for obvious reasons, but most of the chicken was too dry to eat. It was by no means a satisfying meal.  The mexican side, we had a couple of different tostadas, and i remember one of them being ok, but was nothing special. The quesadillas that we ordered were terrible as well.  I can't remember the last time that we threw away our food at a restaurant, but we left very unsatisfied and ended up happier, eating nachos at the Horse Track..lol  I can see this as being a fun gimmick for little kids who like the idea and have no guage of quality food, but for it being a must try for a Yelper, I give it a two thumbs down. It looks like a school cafeteria in the seating area.  I would be willing to give this place another shot if they step up the quality of their food. I do like the concept and would love to see this concept done right.  Cheers and best wishes!

This review strictly relates to the Chicken Salad Croissant sandwich.  I passed by this place for a couple of years before finally giving it a shot. The menu is rather simple and reminds me of a catering business or a cafeteria inside. The location is very old and holds a great deal of history. I noticed that there is an old Barber Shop Museum attached to the eatery.  The Chicken Salad has pineapple and cashews in it. It is very tasty and served on a Croissant. It is just plain and simply good and satisfying. The sandwiches are served with a pickle, and their prices are average for what you get, but certainly not the cheapest in town.  I also ordered a broccoli cheddar soup which was nothing special, and I'm sure that it came from some sort of concentrate, but it wasn't bad tasting for what it was.  The place has an assortment of baked cookies and dessert bars as you would expect to find in a grandmothers kitchen.  If you're looking for a quick sandwich at lunchtime or for catering for your business, then this place seems to tow the line.  Give the chicken salad a try and see what you think, I really enjoy it!

This is my favorite Sushi Spot in Phoenix. I see Sushi Chefs from other restaurants coming here to eat during their off time. =)  The prices are very reasonable, and all of the rolls and sashimi are very fresh and crafted to perfection by the old timers.  The Ramen Noodle Bowl is awesome, and nothing like what you would buy in the grocery store. It is topped with pork, fish cake, bamboo, and seaweed. I highly recommend.  They even have a fried salmon skin roll, which was very flavorful and not always available at every establishment. I wish that i would have taken a picture of the last one that I purchased, it was absolutely perfect.  They also offer Takoyaki, which is like an octopus dumpling ball. You would have no idea that it contained octopus unless you were familiar with the dish. these are absolutely amazing and highly addictive. You have to try these during your visit.  The last time that I was there, I had to try the Ichigo Mochi Ice Cream. It was green tea ice cream, surrounded by a rice flour shell and topped with whipped cream. It really hit the spot and I was so full but in a happy and satisfying way.  If you like Sushi, and you think that RA is cool, hit yourself on the head for being a complete fool and go check this place out and get schooled on what fresh authentic Sushi is all about. Your mouth will thank you for doing the right thing!  Cheers and keep up the good work at the place.  FYI... Bring your own Saki if you need booze with your meal. I say, just enjoy the good meal without alcohol and see how happy and relaxed the meal makes you feel.

I didn't realize that I had a set of Mexican Grandparents, until I stepped into this modest looking haven of fine Tortas.  These things are made with as much love as a mother gives to her newborn baby, and that's no understatement!  I have visited this location on three separate occasions within the past year while waiting for my tires to be serviced across the street.  Upon each visit, I was greeted with a sincere, unbiased, smile that could only come from the heart of a grandparent who was just grateful for each day of life and who got their joy from making others happy by cooking them a meal that only a grandmother is capable of concocting.  From the sweet little voice that takes your order, to the smiling grandpa in the kitchen who makes each Torta or Taco to your liking, you can't help but feel the love in this place, despite the not so attractive surrounding businesses. It really does feel like you're visiting your innocent grandparents who live in a not so hot neighborhood.  Now onto the food that can't help but soak up all of that love that surrounds it.  Today, I ordered the Torta Al Pastor. If you aren't familiar with Al Pastor style meat, which is most commonly associated with pork, you need to do a little research, because you are in for a real treat! I would consider Al Pastor style to be the Mexican version of what Rednecks call BBQ Style. This torta would be the Mexican equivalent to a pulled pork sandwich.  From the warm, lightly toasted bread that is classically used with Tortas, to the light mayo, the Avocado, shredded lettuce, thin pickled green Chile's, thin sliced tomato, marinated pork in the Al Pastor seasonings, the love is in every bite of this beauty.   I'm not big on bread, and sub sandwiches just have way too much bread that take away from the flavor of the quality parts of the sub sometimes. The Mexicans really outdid us with the Torta. When a torta is made fresh and properly by an experienced set of Mexican old timers who love to see people smile when they eat their food, it's something that will put any hot sub in town to shame!  If you aren't a fan of swine, don't be alarmed, there are many other selections, and yes the do have a Torta Carne Asada for the unadventurous Weditos.. ;)  Don't be such a Wedito and go try something different, I can assure you that regardless of the torta at this location, you will not be dissatisfied, and I promise that you will feel like you are eating at your Mexican Grandparents place...  While you are in this place, help them unlock their business on Yelp. They are like most other grandparents and technology has run right past them.  This place could use some business, and I know that others out there who are like myself, always love to know of random little places that may not look so hot from the street, but are a real treat once you break through those doors.  Can't wait to start seeing some more reviews on this place, it deserves some Yelp attention!  Cheers and Salute! ;)

Johnnie's joint speaks for itself, it's been in this town for longer than many of us have been around, he runs the place himself and has been critiqued more than most others in this town over the years.  He has a simple, yet good and tasty product, and Johnnie is a true great himself. His heart of gold is apparent as soon as you hear him talk. He is an honest and fair business man, and would do more than most to make his customers happy.  His place has that old school look, and makes you feel like you are sitting in Phoenix during an earlier generation. As I said, simplicity is very apparent, but the nostalgic atmosphere and Johnnie in there chatting with the crowd makes it a very happy and quick lunchtime experience.  The Chicago Style Dogs are done as they should be, and the Chili Cheese Fries aren't too bad either.  There isn't a whole lot to comment on for this place, except that a good guy like this who takes so much pride in his business, deserves a great review for that alone. When someone puts love into their business, it comes out in their product, end of story.  If you want a good, yet simple Chicago Style Hotdog, give Johnnie a shot, you will love chatting with him if nothing else.    Cheers! :)

This place is without question my favorite Taco Shop in AZ !!!! Period!!  I had no idea what I was missing until I was brought to this wonderful establishment by a friend of mine.  So here's how it works, they grill up the meat and tortillas on a Mequite Fired Grille. You will not believe what kind of flavor it adds to the meat. They offer the standard Carne Asada for the White Boys, but I would stay away. It is far too simple.  If you want to experience some real flavor, go for the Barbacoa, Lengua, Al Pastor, or Tripas. The Tripas are deep fried and so damn flavorful.  They have a ridiculous salsa bar, with amazing salsa's, but you have to ask for the Habanero which they keep behind the bar. They also have fresh cabbage, onions, limes, and peppers with carrots at the salsa bar.  All I can say, is you have to experience the simplicity and mesh of natural flavors. The true experience and blend of flavors is truly indescribable.  The place is clean, super authentic, and always full, even in the morning hours.  it is a straight up Mexican Joint, so learn some damn Spanish and be respectful!  This place is so worth the drive, I now go there at least once a week! I'm craving this place just writing about it.  Trust me on this place, and write a more descriptive review and tell me how right I was by recommending this place. I swear that they put something in the meat to get people addicted, it's that good!  Salute! =)

Don't be intimidated by the location, nor by the name, you will be missing out if you don't give them a shot.  The first time that I saw the van on the side of the road several years ago, I ignorantly chuckled and never thought that I would see myself trying their product.  Well, three years later, here we are and I must say that my ignorant chuckle was exactly that, Ignorant!  If you are curious about trying a Sonoran Hotdog, or if you have no idea what a Sonoran Style Hotdog is, then trust me when I say that this is a definite must in the hotdog world.  The traditional American styles don't stand a chance to the Sonoran Style, not even a Chicago Style dog can touch these guys.  First off, the dog is wrapped in a nice strip of swine, a.ka. (bacon), you then add toppings, such as chopped tomato, peppers, different types of salsa's, finely grated artisan cheese, similar to Parmesan. There are so many different combinations, that you can't eat just one or two. The flavor of the peppers in the Salsa's goes along with the flavor of the dog and the bacon like a bullet in a gun, you can't do any damage unless you have both of them together. :)  The family at this location is as friendly as can be, so don't be scared if you're an uncultured white person, you're not going to get robbed or shot if you're respectful and cool...lol It's good to get out of your stupid comfort zone and be a real human once in a while.   You will have a memorable experience and be glad that you experienced something new, and your tongue will be thanking you and asking you to go back for more instead of driving by and contemplating on making a stop in the future.  The cool thing is that you can sit at the table under a nice awning, drink a Mexican Coke, and pay your entire tab with cash at the end of your experience. If for some reason you have a problem, give me a shout..I'm right up the street. ;)  Cheers!

I have tried this place out on several occasions, and each time has been a similar experience. The Gyro that they serve up is a Kronos. The meat is carved right off the spit, and they certainly don't skimp on the meat. I've ordered Gyros at many places around the valley, and this one is so far my favorite for it's consistency.  Aside from the awesome Gyro's, the Greek Fries and awesome! They are always fried up fresh after you order them, then topped with olive oil, lemon, spices and feta cheese.  I have not yet tried their Philly Cheese steak, but I have seen others order it and it looks pretty good. I plan to try that one next time.  They also make a simple Hummus in house, and it's very tasty.  On one last note, they serve Thrifty's ice cream. Some of you may not be very familiar with Thrifty, but as a kid, I remember going to Thrifty's drug store and getting an ice cream cone on many occasions.  The place is clean, the staff is friendly and from the East Coast. Go give them a shot if you are on this side of town. They do the job right and put their heart into their business.  Cheers and good job guys! =)

This family runs a great business! For the Phoenix area, they run a very clean, inexpensive, and certainly authentic Vietnamese dining experience. Don't throw them under the bus and compare them to some of the greats in Orange County or San Fran, those places are in a league of their own. :)   Thanh himself, is a young guy, whom you will usually find seating you when you visit the restaurant. His parents do much of the cooking and other work in the restaurant.   Everything that I have tried so far in this place has been great! The Cafe Sua Da is brewed fresh in a cup at your table while you eat your meal, which is nice, as many of these places have begun to serve pre-made Cafe Sua da. If you aren't familiar with what I am speaking of, it's a very strong coffee that is brewed by the cup and then poured over condensed milk, stirred, then poured into a glass of ice and stirred once more. You won't mess with Starbucks after trying this brew. It's simple, strong, and has a nice kick, along with some anti-oxidizing effects. ;)   The simple, but classic Pho Thai, which consists of Rice Noodles, Pho Stock, and Thin slices of beef that are placed in the Pho bowl just as they are served, is flavorful and great for a newcomer to the Vietnamese Cuisine. It is accompanied with the typical plate of condiments, which you can add to your own discretion and liking. The plate includes the following fresh items: Bean Sprouts, Fresh Basil Leaves, Lime, Jalapeno Slices, and Mint Leaves. A good Pho, won't require adding Sriracha or any other sauces to the Pho itself. Don't be a NOOB and do this. Mix your Sriracha or Chili Oil with Hoison Sauce in the little sauce dish at the table and dip your beef in it before eating. If you like onions, order Hanh Dam with your dish. It's sliced onions in rice vinegar, be sure to spice them up with Sriracha when they bring them to your table, and eat them along with the beef or a bite of your Pho, it's a great addition to your meal.   The broken rice dishes that I have tried have been great as well. Broken rice, is simply that, Rice that has been broken in half by a special machine. It really changes the texture of the rice in a good way. The Pork Chop that I had with mine was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. It was served with a fried egg, bean curd wrapped shrimp cake, shredded pork skin, and some grilled shrimp. For less than $7.00, its better than one of those secret steak and shrimp meals that you will find in some of the Vegas Casino's, and will fill you up for sure. Be sure to use the fish sauce to drizzle on your meal. Don't smell it, just add a little chili oil, and drizzle it over your dish. I use the whole bowl, it adds so much great flavor to the dish.   The Spring Rolls were the standard with Pork and Shrimp inside, and served with the Peanut Sauce. Be sure to add a little Chili Oil to the sauce before dipping.   The Egg rolls, which will be ordered by most white people were great as well. It's difficult to screw up fried foods. Be sure that you wrap the egg rolls in the lettuce and add some mint leaves to the wrap before dipping in the fish sauce that you hopefully added a little chili oil to.   The Fresh Coconut Water is served proper, in a freshly cracked coconut. You get the whole thing as you should, whereas some of these places around here will just serve you a small glass along with some of the meat from the coconut inside.   They also serve the Vietnamese Sandwiches here, which I recommend. The BBQ Pork is probably the best one, served on a fresh french roll with Cilantro, Carrots, Jalapeno, and Cucumber. For $2.50, you can't beat it. You can actually take these home and throw them in the refrigerator for later.  Thanh himself usually clears and cleans the tables immediately after someone leaves. The service here has always been great, and very quick, considering that the place is usually full everyday at lunch time.  If you are new to Vietnamese Cuisine, I highly recommend Pho Thanh. Be brave, and try new things, you have no idea what you are missing. They don't serve anything odd, and if it didn't taste good, then it wouldn't be on the menu, so don't be so white, and give it a try. You will love it, I promise! :)

I wanted to be a fan of the food at this place because the two guys that were running the place were so friendly.  I ordered two pizzas, one was a Cheeseburger Pizza, and the other was a PB&J with Bananas.  The crust was thin, which is always nice, but this was about as thin as a Lavosh and had a very low quality taste to it.  The sauce, and ground beef tasted like something I would expect to find in a school cafeteria. I would imagine that they just use very low quality, frozen and canned ingredients. I added some dill pickle slices and ketchup to the pizza when I took it home, and it tasted a little better, but I still wasn't impressed by it and won't be eating there again.  The PB&J Pizza was actually good. It went very well with the crust.   The Pizzas are so inexpensive because there really isn't much to them. A pizza from this place would be suitable for one person due to the lack of ingredients and the thickness of the crust.  I ordered some hot wings, and I think that they used the standard Franks Red Sauce. They weren't too bad, but they don't even come close to the Armadillo Gold Wings at Armadillo Grill.  I will give the wings another shot since my good friend Maribeth wrote a review and said that she loved them. :)  Pizza here definitely deserves a thumbs down all the way around. Their pizza looks good on paper, but they need to scratch their crust and ingredient suppliers and come up with ingredients and recipes of a higher standard, even if it means raising their prices a few dollars.  A good product will sell itself. A crappy product will eventually put a place out of business, it's just a slow road to failure. I hope that they take constructive criticisms well and dust themselves off and try again!  Cheers! :)

It is as American as a an Americanized Mexican joint gets, without screwing up the food.  This place has such a simple concept, great organization, and consistency in their products and service.  Although, it's not an authentic Mexican joint, they do a great job at preparing kids and Americans who are uncultured to cross over to the true Mexican side.  The names of the dishes, as well as the presentation of many are all good, but they have tamed down their versions of these dishes to cater to a different crowd.  I recommend this place when you are on a quick lunch break from work.  The Chicken in the Pollo Fundido, is more flavorful, tender, and juicy than any of their competitors, such as Serrano's Garcia's, etc. They roll the marinated chicken breast into a burrito, deep fry it, then top it with Crema, and Cheddar Cheese. It is served with a side of shredded lettuce and rice. The consistency of this and other dishes has been there over the years.  They make their red chile salsa in house and keep it mild for the target audience. You get free chips and salsa with your purchase.  It is basically a Mexican fast food joint that makes things fresh and in house, but with a slight American twist.  They run a great, simple concept of a business. If you enjoy Mexican food that has been tamed down for the Weditos, then this is your place.  Salute! =)

The guys who opened this place up, are a bunch of pervs. There is a reason that they can't keep the place staffed with talent for the long haul.  On a side note, who goes to a barber shop to eat a PB&J Sandwich? A beer, wine, or soda could work, but not a stupid PB&J Sandwich.   These guys have to be losing their asses on this place. I would love to see their profit margin.   If they had any sense whatsoever, they would drop the name and the whorehouse image, which would increase volume. Their target demographic would be much larger and the location is great for a reputable business.  Once they go under, I bet that a smart Russian will snag that spot and offer slick cuts at a good price without all of the perv BS.  Hurry and clean up your act boys. Either run a Barber Shop or a Strip Joint, not a false promised hybrid of the two.

This is by far the best bang for your buck without sacrificing quality in this Valley when it comes to Oysters and Chowder.  I have eaten at the place on at least 5 seperate occasions. It reminds me of a scaled down version of the wonderful Oyster bars that you might find at some of the Las Vegas Casino's, with the addition of some other tasty seafood boils, and cajun concoctions.  First off, the Oysters on the Half Shell are reasonably priced, as fresh as I have had here in the Valley, and everytime that I have ordered them, they have been consistently fresh. I'm not sure that type of Oysters they serve off the top of my head, but they are great!  As for the Clam and Corn Chowder, they are both amazing for the Valley of the Sun! The clam chowder has a great consistency, and does not have that taste of fishy, canned clams. The flavors of the other ingredients are apparent, and the clams are just a nice tender, mild piece of meat that makes a nice filler for the soup. The Oyster crackers that they garnish the chowder with are actually seasoned, and are very tasty.  The Shrimp boil is another favorite dish. They boil the shrimp in a Citrus, Lobster Stock and finish it with a Tomato Cream sauce. They serve most dishes with crusty sliced bread so you can soak up and enjoy the juices of the dishes.  The only thing that I am not a huge fan of, was the crab salad slider. I'm not going to knock the rating down, as everyone else loved them, and the presentation was great. I think that it just wasn't what I was looking to have at the time.  When you visit, you will most likely have the pleasure of a very nice woman of asian descent cooking your food directly over the bar in front of you. She goes by the name of Tip, which looks as if it's the first three letters of her extremely long first name on her name tag. You will quickly notice that she puts a large amount of love into her food preparation. Chat with her, she is a sweetheart, and deserves compliments on her work. Tip her out on the side if you care to, as the tips are only pooled by the servers at this restaurant.   The manager, Frank deserves a couple of bucks for seating you and taking your order, but in my opinion the one who prepares the meal should get the majority of the reward for the culinary experience that they provide, but that's just my opinion. :)  Frank is an East Coast guy with a stratight face and $500 haircut, but trust me, he does have a sense of humor, give him a hard time..lol  One last thing, and I will cut this short. The specials that they served on Easter and Fathers Day, consisted of a one and a half pound lobster with claws, caesar salad, and red velvet cake for around $30.  If you decide to order the Collard Greens, make sure that Tip is working because she prepares them proper, with bits of swine for flavor, as well as a bit of vinegar. It may not sound so great to the untrained tongue, so I suggest you give them a shot and teach your tongue a lesson.  Cheers! :)

This is my new favorite Grocery Store! The sales on the produce are ridiculous! Instead of so much per pound, it's usually several pounds for a dollar....lol   Not all of the produce is top notch all of the time, so you have to pick and choose what you want at the time, and maybe buy certain fruit or veggies elsewhere, due to a bad crop.  The bakery is the next cool thing. I have a Croatian friend who has an addiction to good bread, and he is completely hooked on this place. I see him buy at least six loaves of bread every time we go into this store, and he eats them all within two days. The cakes and pastries are so cheap, and the decorating jobs on the cakes look very nice and are very enticing in a down economy such as this one.  Now onto the Meat Counter. It is very well organized and you take a number. They are quick and the line moves fast, so listen to your number, and don't be a boner and learn some basic counting in Spanish. The ass hat below couldn't understand his number being called in Spanish? He needs to culture himself and have some respect or go shop at Fry's.  You can buy almost any part of the cow or pig in this very clean meat counter. My mother has had a hard time finding seven bone roasts at Fry's and this place has them by the cow load.  They have seasoned meats, such as Al Pastor style, as well as a nice selection of Chorizo's. I love the Salvadorean style chorizo links. They cook down very nicely, and have a great flavor and texture when compared to the standard types of chorizo that you find.  They also have a a nice counter with Mexican Cheeses and in bulk, and some house made salsa's, ceviche, and other delicious items. The prices on the Mexican Cheeses are very low when compared to pre-packaged versions at Fry's or elsewhere.  I randomly tried some Central American style sour cream and it has now become my new favorite as opposed to the American Style. It reminds me of a hybrid of sour cream, yogurt, and butter. You have to try it, it's amazing!  The staff is very friendly, the store is very inviting, and an overall great place to shop.  So get out of your stupid white zone, look up some awesome Mexican recipes and go shop at El Super and make some friends.  It beats the dickens out of Fry's, especially when you hit the meat counter.   Salute! =)

If you're in the area and want a quick fix from south of the border, you won't be disappointed.  These guys used to be at the Filiberto's near 32nd st and Indian School until about two or three years ago. I remember going inside that location at one point and they were passing out flyers and said to start going to Juliobertos as soon as it opened up.  Since I lived just up the street and the dudes were always cool, I gave Julioberto's a shot and was not disappointed.  I always place my order inside, as the inside is open 24 hours as well, not just the drive thru. If you go inside they have a Salsa Bar with several different types of Salsa's, one of them being an Avacado Salsa, which is top notch in my opinion. They also offer pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos at the salsa bar.  Everything that I have yet to try has been consistently good for this type of establishment. The carne asada burrito always seems to be a classic among the white boys like myself, and I must say that I have yet to encounter a burrito that contained fatty meat or a dried out tortilla. The meat has always been seasoned well with all of the condiments inside and the tortilla was fresh and hot. The red salsa and the avocado salsa combined on this burrito or any other adds so much flavor.  The five rolled tacos with cheese, guacamole, and sour cream are always a great late night snack when you're on a diet...I highly recommend..lol ;)  The machaca beef and eggs wasn't bad, nor was the chorizo and egg burrito.  They seem to keep the salsa bar area well stocked and clean, as people make constant messes at those things, but they always seem to be on top of it.  The staff has always been friendly, and the overall experiences have always been consistent.  I highly recommend this place if you are in the area and can't decide which Mexican Fast Food joint to grab your meal from.  Cheers! :)

This place needs some love to stay alive!  After passing the place many times, I finally stopped in and was the only patron there. I chatted it up with the owner and his wife, who were super cool people.  I told him that his Yelp ratings seemed to be pretty good, and it seemed like he definitely had some signature products that put him in a market of his own. He said that The Phoenix New Times told him the same thing, but that business has been extremely slow.  He gave the the lowdown on almost every creation on the menu. This guy created and makes all of his own sauces and dog works of art. It's places like this that are a true work of art, and a hidden gem. They need love to stay alive and in the market, and in this case that love needs to come in the form of cash money.  He ended up setting me up with the famous Maui Dog creation and a side of fries. I must say, that these dogs actually compete with the Sonoran Style Dogs that you find in the Southwest. Between Maui Dog and all of the Sonoran Hotdog joints in this town, they offer competition to the boring, old school Chicago Dog Market. It's very important to have culture in a city, and Phoenix needs to allow these different cultures to grow and flourish.  I know that the area isn't the most lucrative, but these people are some super cool artists, and you don't want to see this place go under due to a lack of support.  Lets all Yelp together and save this much needed icon, so if nothing else, we can have one extra spot to keep on Yelping about!

I certainly had a 5 star food experience at this new, close to home establishment.  We arrived at around 8:30PM, and started off with the Crispy Thai Rolls and the Crab Wontons.  The Thai rolls were great, but who isn't a sucker for Crab Wontons that actually have a noticeable amount of crab and cream cheese in them? Not to mention, a small dot of Sriracha Chili Sauce on the top of the Wonton to give it a small bit of fire when you bite into it? They were a real hit, and the best that I am aware of around town.  Next was a Hot Pot of the CoCo Soup. It came out with the full effect of the flame shooting out the top of the Hot Pot, spiced between Hot and Thai Hot per our request. I must say that I was impressed with both, the soup itself, along with the tender cuts of white meat chicken, fresh mushrooms, and whatever galangal shoots are. I guess that those were more for texture. It was rich, but I swear that I could have eaten the entire hot pot if I were there by myself.  Next came the Seafood Green Curry. It was very flavorful, not a huge dish, but came with Calamari Rings, Shrimp, and fresh Clams with the Shell for effect. The dish was ordered Thai Hot, and was topped with a plentiful amount of fresh sliced uncooked Jalapeno rings. The Flavor of the Green Curry and the Jalapenos blended together very well. The dish was of course served with a side of white rice to spoon the goods over before eating to make it a bit more filling.  The service was great. We were served by the manager and met the Owners wife. She had just picked up their liquor license earlier that day, so we got to have a couple of glasses of white wine with our meal.  I wasn't overwhelmed by the prices, considering the quality of what we were served. Our tab was just under $54 for two people, and that included the wine.  I hope to continue to be impressed with this place, it was much better than I ever would have expected. I can't tell you how many times I have walked into a Thai place in the area and been royally disappointed in the flavor and quality of the cheap food. It takes a lot to make me this happy with a place. I wish them the best, and my first impression was love at first sight. Let's see how long this infatuation lasts.  Give them a shot, and then a deserving review to keep them on top of their game.  Cheers! :)

- Joeys is the McDonalds of all of the Chicago style joints in town -  I consider myself to be a fair, unbiased judge of these establishments in town. I am all about quality and authenticity when it comes to these places, and when one of them cuts corners and is more concerned about profitibaility vs. quality, this needs to be recognized.  When a business puts love into their products, it becomes very apparent, and Joey's shows no love in their products as far as I can tell.  To start, I was almost offended when I was advised by one of their friendly employees that they use Vienna Beef Brand, Beef that is shipped in to them and heated up and served on their Italian Beef Sandwiches. This my friends, is comparable to Taco Bell using their reconstituted meat in their products vs. using real ground beef and seasoning it up in house.  Since they have their meat precooked and shipped in from a mass producer, they also obtain their beef stock from the same source. This all equates to a garbage product. You may as well order a Philly Cheesesteak from Subway if you are going to go this route.  Since you have already heard the direction that this post is going, you have probably already guessed that they use giardinara from who else but Vienna Beef.  Now to the Polish Sausage, it is just as Lobby's uses, a precooked and hotdog like processed link which equates to what you would find in the hotdog section at the grocery store.  With these few, yet major things being the case at this establishment, there is no need to go further with any of their other products.  If you are looking for a fast food type meal with no authenticity and that comes nowhere near the qualty of the competitors in town, then go for it. But if you are looking for a true experience that you might find in Chicago, trust me when I say that you will be nothing less than disappointed.  I would love to see this company change their business model, which would include changing their entire product line so that we could have some real competition for the other true greats in this Valley.  Cheers! :)

I was very excited to check this place out with a friend of mine. It's always nice to have a new spot open up in the area. You always hope that someone has finally done it right. The unfortunate truth is that this place needs to be on the show called "Restaurant Impossible". I'm not kidding when I say this, go and see for yourself.  I have no animosity for this place, it was just very disappointing to see a group of guys / young boys (owners/Investors) standing around in their poor choice of wanna be club shirts that they probably got on sale at Marshall's, along with their poor hair grooming and unprofessional demeanor. It was as if they felt that their machine was up and running and that no improvements or the customer experience was even a possibility of a real issue. The bartender had a frown on his face the entire time, and our waitresses were as friendly as can be but really need to be informed and educated on their brews. I do not put this responsibility on the girls as much as I do the poor management.  Now, with my ranting aside, my reasons for disappointment were as follows:  We ordered the Brewer's Choice Plate which consisted of Mortadella, Prosciutto, and Tuscan Salami, along with a choice of cheeses and a bunch of fillers that they included.  The plate came out and was presented well, but right away the cuts of meat were a disappointment. The thickness of the cuts was ridiculous and embarrassing. The Mortadella was almost room temperature, which can actually be a health hazard. Prosciutto was some sort of cheap salt cured, and hopefully pre-sliced. If they sliced it in house their chef should be fired for slicing such a thick cut of prosciutto. Even a non-chef knows that much. The salami was certainly nothing special, and again the Mortadella was the biggest disappointment. With this as my first impression of the food, I was very turned off and don't see them lasting very long if they don't fix such simple but important things. I suggest that they visit 'The Parlor' and take a look at the quality of the Artisan meats that they serve on their carving board, along with the thickness and temp of the meats. There is no comparison, and this is a no brainer for even a Foodie, much less a chef or a business that was swarming with inexperienced management at the time.  So the next item was the Meat and Potato Flatbread with Pork Belly and three cheeses. I will say that it was mediocre, but missing some element of flavor to make it complete. The chips and guacamole were simple, but no complaints there. I enjoyed the Yucca Chips.  I am not trying to be an extreme hater, but this place has a ton of hype out there and they aren't delivering quality products or service. They need to turn it up and light a fire under the asses of these young guys that are looking at a high profit margin by sacrificing quality food. They will need to offer much higher quality products if they want to stay afloat.   i wish them the best and would love to try them again if I hear that they got everything straightened out. This would be an ideal location and they have a great concept.  Cheers and good luck guys! Constructive criticisms are all I am offering and wish you the best. :)

A true authentic, literal hole in the wall! This place is straight out of an Anthony Bourdain episode. If it weren't for an authentic friend introducing me to this humble looking place, I would have continued to drive past it week after week.  We stopped in and sat on the outside patio in need of a hearty meal, after a busy weekend. I was told that this place is only open on the weekends and that they are known for their Cabeza Taco's among the local Mexican community. I have to say that they hit the spot. They were served with a good amount of meat, fresh sliced cucumbers and radishes on the side, as well as a side of guacamole and fresh made green chile salsa. The corn tortillas are made fresh, and two of these guys will satisfy an appetite.  They also have several types of Caldos (soups). One of which is Birria (Goat), another is Camaron (Shrimp), and a few others.  We ordered a cup of the Caldo Camaron which was great. It was a simple tomato based soup that was full of shrimp. It is served with a plate of chopped cilantro, onion, and lettuce to put in the broth. It really hit the spot after a tiring weekend.   They serve Mexican Coke in Bottles, as well as other Mexican Soft Drinks.  I have a feeling that some may leave bad reviews about this place, but a true foodie who is looking for a simple, realistic Mexican street food type experience will feel the same love and appreciation for this small gem as I do.  Go give this place some support, but please don't be foolish and write a bad review because of how the place looks or the service. Write a review based on what the place is supposed to be , which is a real hole in the wall which is simple and nothing short of authentic.  I will post pics of food after next weekend.  Cheers! :)

I planned to go eat at La Fontanella last night, and to my surprise, a new "Arron May" concept had taken over the iconic Arcadia Italian restaurant.  The Arcadia Yacht Club appears to be the new kid on the block in our little Arcadia hood. The fact that Aaron May and some veteran industry personalities are manning the decks, should hopefully liven up the area.  The skinny-jean clad, Little Woody scene just doesn't cut it. It's time to reform the neighborhood and season things up a little bit. ;)  As for the menu at the Yacht Club, it has not been officially published. I can say that after sampling a few items, such as the Connecticut Lobster Roll, and the Halibut with brown rice, coconut broth, and arugula salad, that I expect to see nothing but the best come from this new neighborhood joint.  Welcome to the hood boys!
