Of the Rancho Market locations in Phoenix, this one takes the Cake! I will never go to any other location as long as I live in Phoenix.  This is a seriously happening place, music, food being grilled, and 100's of people shopping for food.  The Cheese counter, Meat counter and Produce are impressive. Any Meat you can imagine cut in any cut they can think of! The Queso Fresco selection is almost intimidating for a girl like me! But one at time I will try everything!  I almost don't want to go to any other market, because I know that if I need something I will find it here.  The fresh chili selection is imposing, so know something about chili's before you go!  Don't forget the fresh house made Salsa, the green is out of this world! I get a container of it each time I go!

I am so very sad that I don't work anywhere near Rito's, because I would frequent them for lunch if I did! Instead I am left with being able to go once in a while when I am either home for lunch or just happen to be in this part of town.  I was lucky enough to be in this part of town a few weeks back, which  was why I was able to try Rito's for the first time.   I went along with the many suggestions on Yelp and ordered the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style. I also ordered a side of Refried Beans. They were both full of flavor and worth every penny. I don't mind the price so much if my Mexican food is worth it!   The amount of food was enormous! I had enough for a snack the next day! I am looking forward to going back as soon as I possibly can!!  Thank you Yelp! Once again you succeeded in helping me find a really great place to eat!

It was extremely cold tonight, so Jason B. and I wanted to eat something warm. So we decided to go back to Cherry Blossom for the second time, because we really enjoyed it the first time around.  The second go around confirmed it! This is a great restaurant!  We started with the Extremely Spicy Gyoza Pot. Which consists of gyoza in an extremely spicy broth! That kind of spicy that makes you talk funny! But the combination of tasty gyoza and the spicy broth was absolutely scrumptious!   For dinner I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon, Iron Pot. A well flavored broth with seafood such as, calamari, fish, clams, scallops, and the wonderful thick Udon noddles! I like my Noodles thick!   If you like Ramen, Sushi or other types of Noodles, CherryBlossom is a great choice, there is something for just about everyone.

I love diners, I love a place where you have no idea what you want to eat, you go look at the menu and you settle on something that hits the spot. Before Jerry's my go to diner was 5 and Diner. Don't get me wrong I like 5 and Diner, but I love places that aren't Chains.  Jerry's is just a laid back diner, where I think after a few visits they learn your names and you become family. The waitress we usually get seems to remember us each time we go back.  I have ordered the Fried Chicken, which was top notch! So flavorful and crunchy. I loved that the first time we went they only had one more serving so my friend and I couldn't both get the fried chicken. I mean he was a little bent, but I got to eat the chicken. And the fact that it is so popular that you are "lucky" if you get to order it!  I have also been back for Friday Night Fish Fry. The Fish Fry is really good fish and probably the best  tartar sauce of any diner I have been too!  Don't forget the Cinnamon Roll with whipped butter...So sinfully delicious! I feel guilty eating it its almost too good!  This is definitely a place I will be frequenting! I might even get a booth that is my booth!

If you go to LGO Grocery on a Sunday morning for breakfast or brunch and you see the parking lot is full and there is a line out the door, please don't turn around and go some where else, please! You will not be disappointed with the wait! Or just pass it by so there is one less person in front of ME!!!   The quality of food is untouchable! Okay, really their homemade english muffins are what is untouchable! Try the commuter sandwich, yes it is on one of their AMAZING homemade english muffins. If you have been to LGO next door for a meal, then you know the quality of the food is top notch, well there is nothing disappointing about their Grocery!  Oh and please don't forget to pick up a Tammy Coe Red Velvet Cupcake, they are the best I have had to date! The cupcakes can be found in the glass case below the menus. And they are full of the most divine treats you will come across.  LGO Grocery you are truly amazing and addictive. I find myself making excuses to pass by, just so I can stop in for some tasty treats.

Oh Postino's Winecafe, where have you been all my life?!?!   Honestly, I don't drink wine, and trust me my family is so disappointed in me because of this. And because I don't drink wine, I was hesitant to go to Postino's. I mean Winecafe can scare off us non-wine drinkers.  The Truth!?!? Postino's has A-mazing food. And I will brave the wait, because there usually is one, to eat their tasty tasty Bruschetta and their mouth wateringly wonderful panini's. Although if you add Brie or prosciutto to anything and I am totally there!  Okay so back to the moral f the story, Just because you don't drink wine, still go eat at Postino's...really,  you will love it!

Sometimes I wonder how I have never heard of a place, I have lived in the area for almost 4 years now, and I have never heard of Carolina's. But alas, I finally found my new favorite I can practically walk there place!  I am totally impressed with the quality of the Chorizo and tortillas. And to combine them with some eggs...heaven! They "home make" their own chorizo and tortillas, and the quality out of this world!  Their Chimi's are really good too!   If you are ever in the area, don't let the outside of the building scary you away, you will love their food!

I love this location, but then I live not even a few miles away. I love that they are constantly improving the campus. Even though it can be a bit annoying for a semester, by the time you come back the next semester the crappy dirt lot with a million pot holes has turned into a beautiful parking lot...well, if you can call parking lots beautiful that is!  I have taken 4 semesters here, mostly just one class at a time. But coming from San Diego, where we have Universities and Community colleges coming out our ears, I think South Mountain is top notch!  The teachers and staff are great. The classes offered are usually very convenient for working people. The campus is beautiful and I hope as it continues to grow and get updated, I will continue to take many classes here.

I grew up on Mexican food, and I am really picky. I'm from San Diego and I miss miss miss the taco shops I grew up eating at. I had up until this point settled on Fili B's because every taco shop in AZ I have tried has disappointed me. Until Los Taquitos!    I have now eaten at Los Taquitos 3 times! First time I tried Carne Asada tacos and Carnitas tacos, both were really good! The Carnitas tacos were moist and flavorful! WOW! We also had a quesadilla, and it was creamy buttery deliciousness. Have had both items a second time and I am still SOLD! Oh and their Salsa's are really good, too!   I also tried their Pozole, which was a good size portion and very flavorful, a little too salty for my tastes, but I would order it again for my Pozole fix!   If you are looking for a new taco shop...maybe you should find a different one because this one is mine now and I don't want to share! Just Kidding!   Oh and here's an important tip if you like Mexican food...Don't order Tamales at restaurants or taco shops, if you have had a real tamale made at home. They are always too dry and disappointing! And I don't think you can judge a TACO SHOP by an enchilada/tamale...try a taco or burrito...I truly believe that not everything at one restaurant can be great! In my opinion!

This is one of my favorite lunch spots. Their pizza is great! Their salads are packed full of the good stuff, with the best house dressing around. The staff are very friendly and my favorite part is you are asked what you want to drink right away and don't forget the glasses are HUGE! There is nothing worse in restaurants than small glasses and the impossibility of getting a refill!  I have ordered many different kinds of pizza from this Nellos and have yet to be disappointed. The buffalo chicken pizza is so tasty and they will give you extra buffalo sauce and ranch all you have to do is ask. They will make you pizza any way you like it and the wait is never that long. I am always able to keep my lunch at an hour, which of course makes my boss happy!  Don't forget the salads that come piled high with meat, cheese and tons of veggies, you never feel you paid too much for a salad once you dig in! Their dressing is pinkish orange and just superb!   In a part of town that is lacking great places to eat lunch, I am glad Nello's is in my neighborhood!

What a great place to take a bunch of hard working production staff who love pizza for lunch. Their usual lunch special which includes a large pizza, pepperoni of course, and a dozen wings for $22, I think those are the details!?!?  We order 2 specials and it is enough food to feed 5 to 7 hungry workers.  The pizza is very good! It is the perfect everyday, really cheesy, nice and greasy pizza you would expect for a good pizza joint. Their wings are cook just how they should and are nice and spicy.  The fact that it is close to my work and the guys like it makes it a great lunch spot a few times a month.   Well done Barros!

Best Pho in town! Ok, so I may not be the expert, but I have tried my fair share of Pho, and I will return to Saigon each and every time.  What I love about Pho... -The flavors oh my! I know that technically Pho is just beef broth with rice noddles, but it tastes like so much more!  -It's quick, from order to table it takes no more than 5 minutes and you have steaming flavor bowl of yum! -You feel like you are making it yourself, you add the lime, the basil, the sprouts, the hot sauce and you have your own special bowl of goodness.  Saigon knows Pho and if you like Pho, I highly recommend you try it at Saigon!!

Chain Mexican food...that is actually good!?!?! No Way!! But yes! This is one Chain you can't turn your nose up at!   Whether it is for lunch or dinner, I am never let down with their food or service! Their lunch menu is affordable and good serving sizes, so you don't feel like you are breaking the bank.  Dinner has so many choices, but I will only name the two I rotate between. I am a huge Chile Rellenos fan, I order them every where I go and I am particular about where to get the good ones. Abuelo's has excellent Chile Rellenos!  The next dish that is probably the best one on the menu and they know it, is their LOS MEJORES DE LA CASA, which is 2 small perfectly cooked bacon wrapped beef tenderloin medallions and 2 shrimp with bacon, cheese and jalapenos, mmmmm so so so Good!!! Good along with all its synonyms in the thesaurus!!!  If you haven't tried it yet, go! What are you waiting for!?!?!?

Wow it really took me this long to actually try Liberty Market, really!?!?!? What was I thinking! I have been missing out on this place for way too long. And to find it now, just when my company is moving and it was sooo close!!!!  Ok, sorry enough of my whining! This place is just WOW! The food looked amazing; the dessert looked way too good! And the taste did not disappoint either.  My friend and I went to lunch today at Liberty Market, I was at first surprised by the line to order, it was LONG! But the way they seat people is really ingenious; by the time you are done ordering you have a table waiting. Pretty cool!  We ordered the Picnic Sandwich, which was very flavorful. My favorite part was the crisp green apples, which added great texture. A little blue cheese, some turkey, it was really well put together.  We also ordered the White pizza, which was very tasty! The crust was nice and crispy and the pine nuts were an excellent addition. Oh and don't forget dessert, no I really mean it, DON'T forget dessert....well I guess you can if you are on a diet or something. We had the Red Velvet Cake, YUM!  I think Liberty Market really has taken the cafeteria style dining and made it a well-organized machine; I am so impressed by this place. What took me so long to get here, I ask myself again!

Is there a Rating system for Rip off and liars? They would be 5 Stars BAD!  I took my truck into Brake Masters because the brakes were feeling a little off. I was thinking minor work nothing major. And my AC was being weird too.  I get a call saying the good news is the AC will be $190 it has a burnt out resister and needs to be replaced. WHAT the good news is $190?  Then on to the bad news, basically my entire sorry ENTIRE break system needs replacing, Master Cylinder, Front Brakes, Back, or and something was boiling and needs flushing. I'm sure there was more but I was in complete shock sorry SHOCK.  So I pick up my truck that I was convinced would not even make it home, and drove it to another Shop.  Scare tactics is want Brake Masters is about. I am not sure if it is because I am a woman or because I had the unfortunate choice of going to Brake Masters, but never again. And I will be sure to let everyone I know with a Vehicle, STAY AWAY!  Oh I got it fixed for $700 at a different place and nothing was wrong with my Master Cylinder. See my other review!

How can I not love the place where I adopted two of my babies, so many years ago? I was lucky enough at the time for there to be a deal, adopt one cat and get the second one free, or something like that! I laugh, because it's like going to a grocery store with deals like that!  But at the time it was perfect. I adopted two little orange tabby cats, little brothers! They were so great about making sure I knew what was involved and I was set up for my new babies.  I think the aspect I loved the most was the fact that you got one free Vet appointment. Being new to AZ I had no idea what Vet to take my boys to, so it was great to get a list provided by the Humane Society. I was really pleased with the adoption process!  Then a few years later I was blessed with a beautiful chocolate lab puppy, but not a ton of money. I was able to schedule her spaying, drop her off before work and pick her back up after work for a very inexpensive price. I think it is great and extremely convenient. They make it affordable and easy for everyone to spay/neuter their pet, so there are no excuses!  What a great Humane Society AZ!

I will be the first to admit that by choice Subway is new to me. But now it is on my regular lunch menu. How can it not be since they started toasting the bread and have the $5 foot longs! Hard to say no to a $5 foot long, wouldn't you agree.  This Subway location is very convenient to my work place and is usually pretty busy, but I have never had to wait too long for my sub and the employees are nice and talkative.  When I first went to Subway I wasn't impressed with their tiny meat slices and lack of cheese, but I have started ordering the chicken breasts and getting the cheese toasted and I now I feel that I am getting my money's worth. Not to mention their new flavored breads, really delish!

I went with my friend for Sunday Brunch a few weeks back and was very impressed. I ordered the Huevos Con Masa, and it was very tasty. The flavors were so well blended! I thought it would be too rich, but it was just perfect!  My friend got The Bird, he gave me a bite and I was so jealous I didn't order it. The creamy cheese in the omelet was to die for! I am looking forward to going back to order it!  The atmosphere was very comfortable and we didn't have to wait too long, so the overall experience was good!   If you are looking for a good brunch spot, I would recommend The Breakfast Club....cute name and easy to remember!

When I heard about Cowboy Ciao I was excited to try it. The food sounds so interesting and flavorful.  We wanted to try as many dishes as possible, and they were such extremes. We started with the Calamari as we do every place we go. It was not great; the calamari itself was okay, nothing amazing, just okay. The sauce it came with was not good and the combination of the sauce and the calamari was downright gross. Then we tried the Mushroom dish, and it was really good. So flavorful and really rich. I wish I had bread so we could eat the sauce. Highly recommended. The third dish was the Tiger Shrimp with grits (I think) The shrimp were good, but they used Pace Picante Sauce with the grits and it was disgusting! I wish I was kidding about the Pace, but honestly if I went into the kitchen I bet I would find a jar... The fourth dish we tried was the Spare Ribs, and these were really good, I would recommend these as well. The dessert, Peanut Butter and Chocolate Brownie, was not impressive and could have lived without. The roller coaster that was our meal was not what I would have expected for the price we paid and I probably won't go back. This is why I gave it 2 stars. Sorry guys, but maybe you should re-look at some of your dishes...and the prices as well. Is it because it is Scottsdale that they can charge whatever ridiculous price you want?

Is there a rule about New Mexican Restaurants needing a water feature to pass on the way in?!?! I was just wondering because I am noticing a theme....hmmm. My BFF and I went here for dinner the other night. He was in the mood for some beef stew and I was along for the ride. We started with their take on chicken empanada's and I thought they were ok, not amazing. They had an interesting white sauce that kind of reminded me of cauliflower, which might have been what it was...lol I decided to go with the platter that came with a chicken enchilada covered in green Chile sauce, I will be honest, I was not impressed with this and left most  of it on the plate...but the good news was this was not the selling feature of the plate. It also came with a Carne Adovada burrito with red sauce, it was very well flavored and extremely tasty, I loved every bite. And don't forget the Chile relleno with cheese and pork that was extremely tender and very flavorful! I'm a big chile relleno fan, and would definitely order it again! The beans and rice were pretty good, and everything had that New Mexican spice...Not too hot, but enough spice to satisfy! We also splurged this night and got the Sopa Basket, we are not huge honey fans, so we asked what else we could have and they offered warm butterscotch sauce, which was so good we contemplated drinking it...although we didn't give in to our desire! I am looking forward to returning and having the Carne Adovada plate next time!

I'm Confused and Sad...Yelp you lead me astray for the first time in a while!! Why does this place have such great reviews? Do people really think this is good Italian food?? The Calamari was BORING and PLAIN and just disappointing. The house salad was BORING and PLAIN and well...nothing special! The Shrimp & Scallop Antiontte, was okay, the sauce was good. The Shrimp were way over cooked, which just ruined the dish! The only highlight of the meal was the garlic bread that came with the meal. Oh and don't forget the Tiramisu...what the heck...Just Terrible! Not even worth describing.... What a disappointing meal!!!!!

Everything about my experience at Italian Grotto was memorable and absolutely worth the wait, 20-30mins.  First we were greeted by a character of a man who I later learned was the owner. He personal sits everyone who comes into his restaurant and is just a really interesting guy. My friends and I were waiting for a table and were eventually seated at "The WORST table EVER!" called this by the owner. At first we were a little weirded out that we were almost guests with another table, but once we introduced ourselves and got through the formalities all went well. And we got to see what they ordered, which made it easier for us to order.  Oh and lets not forget that the Owner paid for our desserts, because we were at "The WORST table EVER" which the owner yelled at us each time he passed! What's better than great food, but great food an entertainment too! OK the FOOD was very very good. The Caesar salad was just Meh...but the Calamari with a spicy marinara was DELISH! And the Mussels Portifino we exceptional. The mussels were so tender they melted in your mouth. The Shrimp Franchaise, was superb! Don't forget the best Tiramisu I have had in a really long time! Can't wait to go back!!

I must first admit that I have not had the cornbread, and now I am looking forward to going back.  I went with my mom and she ordered the Rotisser Chicken...I got to try it...it was amazing. I'm totally impressed with how the chile flavor penitrated the chicken. I think this is probably the best chicken I have had. She also got the cucumber salad...YUM! I would have been sad I didn't order the same thing...but the Mushroom Meatloaf with mashed potatoes was so tasty too!   Next time though...I will order the chicken!   But I got the wild mushroom meatloaf and it was just as good as the chicken....the mashed potatoes were good too!  It was a very satifying meal

Okay, I went back to Bandera's after realizing that I missed out on the Cornbread skillet...and boy I am glad I did!!!!  The Cornbread Skillet was Heavenly SIN!!! Crunchy, creamy, so flavorful I am in LOVE!  My friend and I shared a few different items, and everything we had was top notch, not sure there is anything at Bandera's that isn't good. I find it hard to believe that a "Chain" Restaurant could have so many great dishes, but Bandera's has proven me wrong.  We also ordered the Roasted Chicken & Low Country Barbecue Beef Rib Combo with Coleslaw. The Chicken is amazingly flavorful. The Beef Ribs were fall off the bone moist. And the Coleslaw was out of this world!! Can I please have the Recipe for the Coleslaw!?!?!?  What a great Menu, not many choices but all of them great!

When I want to feel like I am eating really healthy or pretending to be a vegetarian for a meal, I love Pita Jungle.  But the whole truth is there is no where I have found in AZ or SD that has better Falafel than Pita Jungle. Their Falafel's are perfect, crunchy and not oily at all. They must have some miracle oil that does penetrate the food, because sometimes I forget they are fried! And when you order the Falafel platter it comes with lots of fresh tomatoes, pickles (my favorite), Red onions, and lettuce. Make your own wraps with the pitas provided and you are in HEAVEN!   Oh and don't forget their Mediterranean platter, with tons of great hummus, tabuli, baba ganouj, and my favorite a cold green bean salad, which I know doesn't sound that appetizing, but try it just once and you will be hooked!   The food is always fresh, healthy, and oh so yummy!  And they are expanding all the time! Which means getting good food will be easier! New location to open in Phoenix and Tucson!

These are the best Sandwiches in town! The French baguettes are absolutely perfect, they make the best sandwich around.  The combination of flavors makes for a tasty sandwich. I love how they put a whole bunch of fresh jalapeno's, which I usually pick of all but a few. I enjoy the bite.  You cannot beat the prices, $3-$5 for a fresh sandwich and the best French Baguettes or croissants if you prefer! Although there sodas are small and expensive, around $1.75 especially compared to $1 for a large at other places.   But don't forget their huge selection of Boba's and Flavored drinks, there is truly something for everyone! Taro is my fav!  Mostly I love the convenience of being able to grab my sandwich and head back to work to eat at my desk!

Whether it is eating dinner at the sit down restaurant or getting food to take home, the food at Tia Rosa's is pretty darn good!  My personal favorite is getting take out from the little shack across the parking lot. There chicken Chimi is really delicious and very filling! Their beans are really good, and it is hard to please me with beans. The Chimi comes with guacamole, sour cream and salsa. All make great complements to the Chimi.  Their salsa are pretty tasty, they aren't that spicy, but other than that I love getting their Chips and salsa when I take my Chimi to go.   When I'm in the area I am always happy to stop by Tia Rosa's!

Maybe it is because I am new to Dim Sum and I have only tried 2 different places...but everytime I go to China King i leave very satisfied and looking forward to go back again.  I go with my friends who usually do the ordering and we don't get the scary stuff...ya know the chicken feet and such...although one time I did have to watch them eat shrimp heads, and I would be happy to never see that again...but really the food is good.  I love shrimp, which helps because most everything has shrimp!   This is a fun, filling experience for friends and or families. Go hungry!

I first learned about Chino Bandito when the Chandler location just opened. And at that time I was a huge fan. I remembered how much I loved anything in the quesadillas. The cheese and tortillas were a perfect combination with something like sweet and sour pork...who would have thunk it!!!  I have in the last few months gone to Chino's 2 times. I have always gotten my fall back the Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla, it is so good! And I have tried their Chile Relleno. Which is so interestingly unique. Who ever came up with the idea of using Chinese Wontons crushed up as the coating of the Chile Relleno deserves an Award! Who doesn't love Chinese Wonton!?!?!   Don't forget the Black Beans, which are spicy and combined with the Jerk Fried Rice, YUMO! The best sides to your already unique and fun meal.  I think the best part is when people see your food and you tell them Chinese Mexican Food. Their reactions are priceless!   This is not healthy food, this is not food to eat regularly, but every once in a while it is a darn good meal!

First off I cannot comment on the Restaurant, as I only went here to buy grocery's.   That said I am excited about the products this place carries. First off, the Meat counter had Goat, which makes me very happy. It is rare to find Goat in most places. I really liked their selection of meats. Almost as amazing as Ranch Market.  The Baklava was OMG AMAZING!!!!!! I had to hide it so I would not continue eating! My only complaint was it was kind of pricey, but it is probably best for my diet that it was pricey, ya know what I mean?  They had some interesting produce you don't see most places, although as a whole there produce is limited.  Their selection of spices was vast, they probably have anything you might be looking for.   Looking forward to go back and try the restaurant...oh and don't forget to pick up some more Baklava.

Herbs and Spices OH MY!!!  Every Spice, Herb, baking ingredient you can imagine is here and the quality is just superb! I will never waste my money at any other place on spices or herbs...because unless they are Penzey's they are a waste of money!  I personally love there Cumin, their extracts, Vanilla and Almond, and their many Cinnamon Choices, are the most amazing quality and are worth every penny.   I look forward to every visit to the store so I can try a new item each time I go. I keep a list in my spice cabinet to make sure I never run out and so I never have to rush off to the grocery store for a spice while cooking...God forbid I run out of my Penzey's Spices!!

From the outside Va Bene looks like an every day Italian Restaurant. But once you go in it is fancy smancy!   I have been to Va Bene a few times for different occasions and I continue to return for the Calamari alone! The absolute best Calamari I have found, and trust me I try the Calamari every where!   Their food is good, I have also ordered the Fruiti Del Mar, which was a really great dish. My friend a year later still talks about the best steak he has ever had.   I think Va Bene knows what they are doing and should continue to make its customers happy if they stick to their recipe for a great restaurant!

So my friend (Jason B.) suggested this place...and I was not convinced by the name...weird images of pot pies out of the movie Sweeney Todd, floated through my mind...I know that is so horrible! Sorry if I grossed anyone out with that! Then to top it off, it was almost impossible to find, because it was so dark!   The place is long and skinny, and when you sit at the bar you get to watch people make the calzones (for lack of a better word) which is fun! It was kind of weird at first to have a conversation, but you get comfortable!  We decided to order 2 and share, so we could try more variety. We got a meat and cheese, which was served with a red wine sauce. Maybe because I am not a fan of red wine I didn't like the sauce!?!? But the pastry was so tasty! The meat was very flavorful and the cheese was gooey and yummy!   We also ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, wow was this spicy! Don't get me wrong I can handle spice! And I would say any more and it would be too much. The Sauce that came with it was necessary to cool off your mouth, and it helped that it was very tasty and refreshing!   I am looking forward to going back and trying the many different pastries they have.  But please don't let me forget to mention dessert aka creamy heavenly goodness, that is the peanut butter and jelly pastry. Fresh hot out of the oven with jelly sauce....oh my! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! When you go, and you should, don't forget dessert!

This is probably my favorite Rubios location for really one main reason. The 2 girls/ladies (sorry) that work here during the lunch hour. These ladies have made it a point to remember the regulars and always be the most pleasant people around!  They always greet me by name and ask how things are and they even remember what I usually order, which is way impressive!   I grew up in San Diego going to the first Rubios ever on the SDSU campus, I remember when I was a young kid and I hated when my parents took me to Rubio's. Now I love their Fish Tacos!

I wish you could give a place 1/2 stars! Iguana Mack's has great food! I love their sandwiches; they are all really unique and different from your traditional lunch places. Oh and they have tatter tots, I miss those from elementary school!  Their food deserves 4 starts! But because the service is usually pretty slow and I have been forgotten about at least 3 times during the lunch hour, I think they deserve at least a 1/2 a star less.  If you stop by for lunch you have to try the Sirloin Sliders, they are very filling and come with an Au Jous, if only it was the same au jous as Riga Tony's their sister restaurant! But it is still pretty good!   Their Club has alfalfa sprouts, which is weird, but it works! And they have a really tasty Ruben!   A good place for lunch, but not if you are in a hurry!

So I have been in search of a place to watch Football and Basketball...As I am a Fanatic! I am honestly tired of the same old Native and chain sports bars.   So my friend and I were planning on watching the Suns game last Monday, and I went to yelp in search of a place to try. I read the reviews on Hail Mary's, and wasn't completely convinced..but I decided to try it.  Now, I am sold! First off, it is extremely comfortable, you walk in and get to decided where you want to sit. The bar area is nice, kind of small, but very nice! The main room had many booths (my personal favorite) and tables. TV's were everywhere, it would be hard to find a bad view. They are great about changing your tv to what you want to watch!  As well as most of the booths have a tv at the head of the table.  They have amazing happy hour specials, Monday-Friday 4-7pm, many different items are only $.99! The pork tacos are amazing, Cajun Fries (yum, spicy too) and Rippers (do you know that those are? SO Tasty!) You just can't beat $.99!  I have now been 3 times, I did mention I was a sports Fanatic, right? And it hasn't been crazy busy, but there are people. Service is always good!   I highly recommend this place! Especially during happy hour!

I truly believe that when your dogs go to heaven they go to a place much like Cosmo park. Especially if you have Lab's like mine!  The thought of a dog park with a LAKE, who would have thunk it!?!?! My girls (2 Labs) love this park. They love swimming the lake and running along the shore and jumping off the pier....I'm telling you DOGGIE HEAVEN!!!   Although, their are a few negatives about this dog park....but it isn't the Dog Parks fault that people are idiots and don't know how to handle their dogs in the park ....Numerous times I have had to give some poor    doggies owner some advice...Like let them OFF the leash...you wonder why all the other dogs want to eat/attach your dog...um really?  All in all I love this park and I wish every park had a Lake!!

Yes this Starbuck is busy, and yes this Starbucks can be slow.  But it is the first Starbucks I have gone to that the barista made a great suggestion. I love my Caramel Macchiato's BUT I am tired of my Caramel Macchiato's. And the Barista suggested half Vanilla and half Hazelnut.   I love my new drink and I love that she thought to suggest something new.  That is something I just don't get about Starbucks, they rarely add new drinks to their menu, and I am sure most Starbucks fans are ready for something new! I have my new drink...now I just need to figure out how to order it everywhere...hmmmm

Clean, bright and colorful are words that I would use to describe this Restaurant.  Tasty, flavorful and Yum are descriptions of their food.   This is my new go to lunch place! I am also extremely happy that it is 5 minutes away from work, that makes it so convenient as well.  I have tried the following items:  -Turkey Avocado BLT wrap. Even though they forgot the Avocado, which was a bummer, but the wrap was still really good. You can really taste the freshness of the ingredients.  -Fireman Ruben, excellent warm sandwich, they do not skimp on the turkey, it is almost too much, almost! -Carne Adovada, EXCELLENT! Although a touch too salty, otherwise just a simple well flavored sandwich and very fresh bread.  I highly recommend AZ Bread company, and I can't waiting to continue to try their different items on the menu. I am also looking forward to trying breakfast there one day.   It is nice to have a healthy filling option for a quick and/or relaxed lunch!

For years Georges has been my favorite place to eat Gyros! And at the lunch hour this is definitely the place to be!   Their Gyros Sandwiches come with either a Greek salad, which is full of great veggies and always fresh or some really tasty fries! Wow writing this review makes me want to rush over to Georges now!!  They serve everything Greek you can think of as well as Italian. There food is always delicious and I have never been disappointed!

I have been searching for a Vet since I have moved to Phoenix over 5 years ago. Dr. Hunt and Homestead are my 4th Vet. I have found my forever Vet!  I took my 2 dogs (Labs) in for their yearly visit, and has some concerns about the older one. Dr. Hunt started with my younger dog, and he was very good. Jazzy has serious issues with Vets, she barks and gets very upset. Dr. Hunt handle her just as I would expect a Vet to handle a nervous dog, and got everything done. I have had another Vet look at me and ask what he was supposed to do with my nervous girl. Maybe I'm a little looney but I would think a Vet would know how to deal with my nervous dog.  Then we moved on to Jewel, who has had a bunch of lumps appear all over her body. He felt them and discussed that he thought they were probably just fatty deposits, but he would like to check them. Dollar signs we adding up in my mind at the thought of having him check her lumps, but this is my baby, so I said No Problem.  He took a syringe and made a slide right there for each of the 2 major lumps. He came back in about 10 mins and said one was just fat, but if I had time, he would like to look at the second one again. Once again, I said no problem. Five minutes later, he came back and said that one was fat too.  I left the Vets office paying $130 for both dogs, and of that $29 was for him looking at the Lumps. A Vet who isn't in it just for the money and how much he can get out of each owner?!?!?!? NO WAY!  This is a rare Vet, he doesn't have the greatest hours, but he is absolutely worth working around, your pet will love him and you Wallet will definitely like him too!

I went here for breakfast this last weekend and after reading the reviews and listening to my friend who had already been here, I was excited to try the breakfast. Let's just say I have had better and was not impressed. Maybe it is this location, or maybe it is that I just expect more for breakfast, but I thought this restaurant was both a waste of tummy space and money!  I ordered The Vatican Skillet, which was dry and lacking a lot! It needed sauce, salt, pepper, you name it, it was missing it! Took most of it home and ate it later all fixed up.   Will not be returning...

I am in no way an expert on Philly Cheese Steaks. I just happen to know the right people and the ones who have searched out good food. So my friend who lived in Philly for quite a few years had searched out Corleone's and informs me that this Cheese Steak is the closest thing you can find to a genuine Philly Cheese Steak!   So we went to try it, and my only regret is that I did not find this place sooner! They cook the meat right there for you, so you don't question its freshness! I of course ordered my with Cheese Whiz, which I am kind of embarrassed to say, but I love my Whiz.   I was informed that what makes this a Philly Cheese Steak is the bread, the way it meltdown to nothing but the crust just enough to keep the meat in. Not sure if that factor went into why this is a sandwich I dream about and I must get my Corleone fix at least one a month! If only it were closer to work! Oh well! Its worth being late!

I am sorry Yelp, but Burritos are a food group! Especially for ME!  I just starting working in the area and have been in search for a place for breakfast, lunch and good eats. So I went to my trusty Yelp app, and was not disappointed to find The Original Burrito Co.  I have found my new Favorite Breakfast Burrito of all time! Number 12 Huevos Ala Mexicana: Eggs and some veggies and cheese. It is truly a well put together burrito, hits the spot every time.   Don't forget the salsa! It is one of the top salsa's I have had!  I have ordered a few more items off the menu and I have enjoyed them, but nothing as wonderful as the number 12!

So after a terrifying experience at Brake Masters I found 180 Automotive on Yelp (thank you!) and took my truck there.   All I can say is I have found my safe haven and where I will be sure to take all future vehicles and recommend to everyone I know.  Kory and Bogi are great about making you feel comfortable with what is going on. They explained everything and have competitive pricing for their repairs.   I was told my BM that everything was wrong with my vehicles brake system; 180 Automotive looked at my truck and were very honest about what was going on with it. Instead of $1400 at BM it was $700. Granted they were honest and told me that my trucks Master Cylinder was fine, so that did save money.   I am always trying to find women owned businesses, but I never dreamed that I would find an automotive repair shop owned by a woman. A place not into scare tactics and honest...who would have thought it was possible!

I was first introduced to Let Them Eat Cake (love love the name) at the Yelp In Bloom Event. It took me far too long to get over to their store!   Their cupcakes are truly the best I have ever had. They are absolutely Beautiful, so creative and YUMMY!!   The buttercream is to die for, and my favorite part! The cake is moist and the filling inside is well done also!  Whether it is, Better than Sex, Boston Cream, Butter Rum, or one of the many other flavors, I have not been disappointed, nor will you. I am looking forward to an occasion to order a cake.  I suggest swinging by for a few cupcakes to make it through the weekend, even a few days later the cupcakes are still delish and moist.  Thank you Yelp for pointing me in the right direction!

All day happy hour for Sushi, need I say more?  Okay, I will, I went to Pearl about a month ago with a few friends. We ordered a bunch of dishes of the happy hour menu, everything coming in at $6.  Calamari, good, but a little too small. Rock Shrimp Amazing! The sushi rolls, Rice Crispy, Fish Stix and another I can't remember, All very good. Actually the Fish Stix was so good that we ordered another.  Jason B. and I decided to go back and see if the food held up to a second visit. The Rock Shrimp were just as wonderful as they were the first time, Fish Stix still one of the top rolls I have had, and don't forget the Rice Crispy roll!  If you are looking for good quality sushi for a good low price, I highly recommend Pearl!

I have always dreamed of a sushi bar where the sushi rolls revolves around you, where you grab to your heart's content....I mean, I'm from San Diego and I have never been to...as my friends and I like to call it...Conveyor belt sushi!!!   As soon as we walked in we were so excited...we just started grabbing anything and everything we could...well except for the fruit and pudding cups, WEIRD! But once you got over that, the sushi was good, I was impressed that the Las Vegas roll was still warm...and the basic sushi was good!  BUT there were 2 things that I had never had before....and at first look one might skip over these dishes...but you want to try them!! The Squid Salad, so freakin good! So flavorful and yummy! And the Poppers, I can't remember the first part of the name...these are jalapeño poppers, sushi style. So good! MUST TRY!  After grabbing to our stomachs delight and piling the plates as high as they would go, we only spend $12 per person and we were stuffed...next time we should control ourselves better!  Can't wait to go back!

We were looking for a place to have a late dinner on NYE without a wait, and were pleasantly surprised that Maizie's was not too busy and sat our group of 5 right away.  Most of us ordered Burgers, as that is the main choice of meal. I was not overly impressed with my Stuffed burger, I'm not sure I would be rushing back to Maizie's.  Over all Maizie's was quite Meh...Maybe I will have to go back for another try, and make sure I haven't judged them too harshly...We shall see!

Thai food is one of my most favorite foods of all times. And once I find a place I like, I return!   So after trying Thai Elephant about a year ago, I really enjoyed my food. I decided this was one of my new regular places.   Their Pad-Z-U was really good, I love this dish and usually ordered it. I also usually ordered the Eggplant and a rice dishs.  The last time I ordered my 3 dishes to go, and each dish tasted exactly the same, and they all tasted bland. I was really surprised, normally each dish has such great flavor and tasted different. I am not sure if it was just an unlucky day or if the quality of food has gone down.   But sorry Thai Elephant you lost me as a fan! Your recipes and food should always be as consistent as it can be.

I think if I sat back and tried to come up with the most perfect grocery store, I still might have never come up with Fresh & Easy!  If you don't like to cook or you like to cook easy but good quality food, F&E is the place for you to shop. The layout is easy to meander through. The organization makes shopping very easy.  I love their produce, which is continently packed and usually the perfect serving size. They have really inexpensive Tofu, which I love to put in my curries. And you can buy everything you need to make a fresh pizza, their cheese department is amazing!  Oh and did I mention that no one can beat their prices?!?!? And also don't forget to check out the almost expired section, you can get killer deals on things that are just about to expire, but are still good!  They carry some really unique products you don't find at the grocery store, but most of all F&E is really one stop shopping! If you haven't been to one yet, you have to go and I guarantee you will be back!

Went to Majerle's for the first time last Monday night to watch the Cards play Monday night football. I promise that I will not allow the horrible loss and embarrassing game played affect my thoughts on Majerle's! Sorry had to put that out there! I have never seen in one place so many Cardinals fans! It was impressive! I lucked into a booth inside, showing up 45 mins before the game. It must have been meant to be! I was very impressed with the amount of tvs and the quality! It was almost impossible to have a bad view of a tv, and in a sports bar this is the most important aspect! Their happy hour specials were good, and I will be back because of them. We started with spicy chile garlic chicken wings, and they smelled really good! Problem...they didn't taste as good as they smelled, which is disappointing. Then we ordered the chicken strips, and they brought medium spice buffalo sauce...this sauce was probably the best buffalo sauce I have ever had...so next time I will make sure to order the chicken wings with the buffalo sauce, YUM! I also got to try their spinach queso dip, which was okay...the only really good part was the wonton type chips that came with! Over all a very good experience and I will be back at one point to watch a game and grab some grub!

YUM! Everything we ordered was really good! The Crispy Shrimp and okra, with hot and cold sauces, very good!  The Mac and Cheese was okay, I wouldn't get the lobstah next time if I ordered the dish, actually not sure I would order it again.  The Fired Chicken with citrus brine...I am still thinking about it 2 weeks later...so YUM! This dish is why you should go visit the Tuck Shop alone!   Although just seeing the dishes pass us by my dinner partner and I have a list of thing we want to try when we return to the Tuck Shop and Return we will.  Great job Tuck Shop!

I am lucky enough to work with a few guys who are always in search of the best places to eat Mexican food, and thanks to my co-workers I have found Moreno's.  This small taco shop has become a regular spot for me, especially on Wednesday's when it is 99 cent taco day.   Their Carne Asada tacos are absolute perfection. The Carne Asada is so flavorful and tasty, with onions, cabbage and cilantro. They are on perfect little flour tortillas, very thin so they double them up. Also don't forget to swing by the condiment bar and get some of their guac sauce, as I like to call it. A really refreshing Avocado sauce, with great flavor.  Their Tortas, and Sonoran hot dogs are really good too!  If you're ever around, stop by Moreno's, I usually get mine to go!

I have been a fan of Thai Rama for 4 years now. I have frequented all three locations and had trouble deciding which to review: the location with the best food (Phoenix), OR the location I last went to last (Tempe), OR the location I started going to in the very beginning (Chandler). You can imagine with these decisions to make why it took me so long to write my review....Oh and don't forget the question of whether I should review all three!?!?!? Just Kidding! Decision decisions.  So I am doing the responsible thing and reviewing the Newest Location and the last one I went to.  My friends and I always order #20 Shrimp, Lemon grass, coconut milk steaming bowl of a soup that is a little sour and just so flavorful and delicious, with beautiful mushrooms and great big shrimp. Could be one of my last meals on this planet and I would be happy! Don't forget it comes to the table on fire! I always wondered if you got it to go...do you get the fire too!  #61 wide noodles with dark soy sauce chicken, eggs and broccoli. Which is probably my favorite noodle dish of all time!. I like there Phat Thai, but the best one is at the Phoenix Location.   Their Panang Curry is THE BEST, actually any of the 3 locations have great Panang! Only order if you are fan of Coconut Milk. I most definitely am!  Thai Rama will always be my go to Thai place. I am sure there are other great Thai places, but sometimes is nice to go to a restaurant and know exactly what to order!

This place is dangerous! I went here last Sunday for a late brunch with my bff. We had gone out drinking the night before so we were ready for a feast! And feast we did! This place is so cute! Well planned, very spacious and I loved that they had tvs playing football, nice touch! It was pretty quiet, just recovering from a busy morning and therefore no wait. It took a few mins for the waitress to come by, but once she did everything from that point was great service, even to the point of a little entertainment (i.e. Singing to the music after sucking on helium, too funny) I decided on ordering The Hangover, I will be honest I wasn't sure what I was getting, but once I got it I was sold! A pile of French fries, with strips of bacon and cheese curds completely smothered in yummy brown gravy with 3 fried eggs on top! Oh MY!  It was so decadent and tasty that I didn't even pay attention to what my friend ordered! The bacon, must be mentioned as it is the name sake, is A-Mazing!! I am really picky about my bacon, and hate the fat, especially when you can tell it is fat...this bacon however was meaty and flavorful, and I made sure none was left behind. If you are looking for a great place for brunch or a late breakfast, I highly recommend Bacon! Yummo!

I have been looking for my go to place in Phoenix for a while...you know those days when you want something good to eat, but nothing sounds good? I am happy to say that I have now I have found my go to place...when the question comes up of where I want to eat...they don't even have to ask! Gallo Blanco here I come!  To start, the appetizers are amazing, the chicharron de queso....i mean if you love cheese, hello! and the amazing Aiolo, my only complaint...there isn't enough aioli! And the guac...who would have thought that fruit in my guac would be good, but it was amazing also!  The Naco Torta....is honestly one of the most flavorful and orgasmic experiences i have ever had....just get it once and you will be hooked. Quite frankly I feel sorry for anyone who doesn't eat beef, because you are seriously missing out!!  They have amazing tacos, and their burger rocks too....but until i am totally sick of the torta...i will not be going back..... If you are a yelper... trust me!?!?!? You must eat here!!!!!!!!

One word Lahvosh....two words LB Favorite! For this dish alone I will continue to go back to Local Breeze again and again and again. Actually I think it's a waste of time to get the small one, because what is better than left over's!?!?!  This Lahvosh is perfect, the combination of flavors but the most important element and the one they do not skimp on the BACON! For years I have denied myself bacon, because I know that a healthy person or a person trying to be healthy should not eat it. But because Local Breeze has opened my eyes to how wonderful bacon can be...I can never close them again.  I have also tried the Spicy Marinated Beef Sandwich , which was good, but not spicy like the Menu tells you.  The service has always been great! Although there was one time where my friend Jason B. was like a stalker outside the window to get the waitresses attention...but that's a story for another day!  I love the patio and just how comfy and at home it feels! This is a great go to restaurant! Please just do me a favor and don't order the LB Favorite Lahvosh, because sometimes I just don't like to share!!!

Last night I went to the Parlor for the second time, I was waiting to try it again before I wrote the review, simply because I only tried a couple things and they were amazing. I didn't trust that it would be as good the second time. I was wrong! I went with my Brother (the Sommelier) and his wife, who drove in from San Diego for the weekend.  And Jason B. who clearly loves this place. We decided to start with a pizza as an appetizer. The Duck pizza, it was very delectable. The Squash puree was really well flavored and went  will with the pizza, which surprised me.  I ordered the Duck Club, oh my! It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The Duck was so tender and the red wine jelly was so well flavored it really made the sandwich! I would recommend everyone try the Duck Club! My brother and his wife shared the beet salad, which was good but too small according to my brother. The Spicy Seafood Linguine, which he said was exactly what he had hoped it would be and really excellent. And the Spicy Barbeque Chicken Pizza (They were really hungry!) and they enjoyed the pizza as well.  I find my family hard to impress, and they were, so for that alone the place deserves 5 Stars!  Service was good, the pizza was slow, but then they can only fit so many in the oven, so we understand. The wine selection was okay, not impressive according to my brother, but they thought the prices were good. Over all a great experience and the perfect place to impress out of town family! Great job The Parlor!

Sara F. what restaurant did you go to?!??!   This place is as great, lunch or dinner buffet, you name it is good. I would like to consider myself a bit of an expert on Indian food, especially buffets. I grew up eating Indian food and I love my parents for it!  I loved that they have goat and lamb! Not many Indian buffets have either of those meats, or only have them on special occasions. Not Indus Village! I have been to lunch many times and they always have the chicken curry, I always skip the chicken though, the sauce is so so YUM!  They seem to have the same main dishes and change out a few other ones. But personally I have found a place where they have dishes I love, so I hope they have the same few dishes every time I'm there!   This place doesn't disappoint!

So I will first admit that I am a Southern Californian transplanted to Phoenix. So I am biased and I love In N Out Burgers and Fries   I order the #1 animal style. Which for those of you who don't know the secret language that is at In N Out, that is with grilled onions, lots of pickles and spread. Oh and today I learned something about the burgers being grilled with mustard. Who knew...not ME!!  Oh and I took an Newbie, an East Coast Newbie none the less today. Guess what?!?! She loved the burger...but not the fries! I really think the fries are an acquired  taste, especially if you are a McDonald's fry fanatic...All that fake beef flavoring is hard to compete with...ya know some people just like fake flavor...not the fresh cut and fresh cooked fries that are In N Out's   I get that In N Out is a regional burger place. I think that just because you don't understand the appeal doesn't mean it isn't good and has lots of people who love it...and at times CRAVE it!

So the idea of take and bake is a new concept to Americans, especially when it comes to Pizza. But the idea has been tired and I am SOLD! My friends and I always like to get a pizza at home watch a movie and hang out with our combined 5 dogs. But pizza can be expensive, $20 or more. We gave Papa Murphy's a try and found that $14.99 (full price, although we had a coupon) and baking it at home was a winning combination! We had the Chicken and Garlic Stuffed pizza. It was creamy and oh so flavorful, with a combination of garlic sauce and cheese. There were tons of fresh ingredients; we actually watched it being made. We ordered the family size, and there were tons of leftovers, which always makes us happy! I would highly recommend Papa Murphy's, the pizza is great and less expensive.

Jason B. and I tried this place for Dinner last night. Having read the reviews on Yelp we were prepared for the lunch food for dinner. I think a sandwich for dinner is great every now and again!  We started with the TMI Dip, which was warm cream cheese with chunks of Jalapenos and lost of tasty crispy bread. This was good; I think the dip needed a little something else to make it perfect, but a good start to our meal.  Then we shared the Mac and Cheese, and OMG was this Mac and Cheese the best I have EVER had. There was tons of good quality creamy cheese, and green chilies. WOW don't change a thing!  I order for my main meal The Sheridan, which was spicy and very good. The salami and turkey made for a really well put together sandwich. I also had the side salad, which was dressed with the BEST balsamic vinaigrette! So good, I wanted more salad...So next time I will for sure order a salad with the vinaigrette.  I definitely recommend The Main Ingredient, even for the non drinkers out there, the food is really well put together!

The food is 5 +++ Stars! Completely unique and so flavorful. I can't say enough about the Quesa's (except I really hope they are fat free...hehe) Their tacos are even great after a 15 min car ride back to my home. Everything I have tried has been very tasty!   The Salsa's are 5++++ Stars! The cilantro cream, holy moly can I have a gallon to put on anything and everything...I really  think it will make everything taste amazing!  Over all La Condesa is a great Gourmet Taco shop and the quality of the food definitely  puts the Gourmet in the name. I love using La Condesa as take home food for out of town guest, they are always impressed!  What knocks my review down a star, difficulty parking and the lack of AC in the summer. I much prefer to get it to go!

I am always in search of good food fast...not fast food! I think Jimmy John's knows what they are doing, and should continue to knock out those sandwiches, FAST.  I love that I can pretty much know, I will a) Not wait in line and b) be in and out in 2 to 5 minutes flat! Heck yeah! And get a very tasty filling sub.  I recommend the Lulu, it is very good, and has tons of meat.  Oh, don't waste your hard earned money on the Avocado. This is my only complaint about Jimmy John's, they have pureed avocado and just spread it on like it is mayo, only they don't put much on. I think it is a waste of money.  This is my go to lunch place when I am in a hurry!

L'Mage Studios have 3 locations, the one off of the 101 and Ray is their 3rd and newest.   The location is beautiful and brand new. I love the layout of multiple little personally owned studios in one building. They have a common area for the hair driers but mostly it is like a small community of hair dressers/stylists, masseurs, etc.   My girl is Kelly at Suite 109 Salon and I love her! I started with Kelly a few years ago at a different salon and followed her to L'mage.  I love the small salon feel of the place and the convenient communication directly with your stylist so you can make an appointment that works for both of your schedules.

I work just down the street from Riga Tony's and have worked in the same area for 5 years. I have found that there is a serious lack of good restaurant places, especially non-chain restaurants.  I am happy to say that Riga Tony's is a lunch place that frequent and always have a great experience at.  The main meals I love at Riga Tony's are the Rigatony, I work just down the street from Riga Tony's and have worked in the same area for 5 years.

The main meals I love at Riga Tony's are the Rigatony, which has both red and white sauce, with lots of cheese and sausages. This is a filling comfort food meal that I look forward too! The best part is even though it is the Wednesday lunch special you can order it any day.  Their subs, which were just added to the menu maybe a year ago now, are probably one of the best put together subs in town. I especially recommend the Raging Bull, it has the best Au Jous I have ever had!  Their salads are really good to; they have a really delish house dressing and a ranch that is like no other you have had.  If you are in the area for lunch I highly recommend stopping by! Although one quick note, sometimes the wait staff can be really slow, so don't be surprised if your meal suddenly takes longer than your lunch hour...not all the time, but sometimes! which has both red and white sauce, with lots of cheese and sausages.

I have only heard great things about Tasty Thai. So I was excited to try it. My last few Thai experiences have been Meh so I was hoping for more.   I ordered my usual's Pad-See-Ew, Green Curry and Eggplant. I am always in search of the best Pad-See-Ew, and while this was the highlight of my meal at Tasty Thai, it was in no way the best Pad-See-Ew I have had.   The Green Curry was almost like water, the broth was really thin and there was tons of green beans and bamboo shoots (although the bamboo shoots were shredded, not a fan). The broth was okay, but the fact that it was watery kind of ruined the whole dish.  The Eggplant was just not as good as I have had before. The actual eggplant was at times undercooked and then another pieces was a mushy mess. Just not a worthy dish.  Overall, I am probably not going to return, there are just too many Thai restaurants to continue trying one that didn't impress on the first try. Oh I got my food to go, not sure if that might have made a difference, and the left overs were just as Meh and the food was the first night.

I too wish I had checked out Yelp before I bought the Living Social Voucher! What a waste of time this process was, first appointment got a call well after scheduled time to say she was in the hospital and couldn't come, ok I'm not a monster I understand. Second appointment schedule two weeks later, once again well after appointment time we cannot come flat tire. The owner called and instead of starting with something appropriate like I'm truly sorry this happened again she give me guilt like I'm  a bad person for wanting a "professional company" to be on time.  Rude, unprofessional and a waste of your time!  Called Living Social and they were wonderful refunded my money and sent a notice to their sales department about this company.    I challenge anyone who has had a good experience with this company to post, so it doesn't look like only the negative reviewers review the company. Maybe someone out there had a good experience.
