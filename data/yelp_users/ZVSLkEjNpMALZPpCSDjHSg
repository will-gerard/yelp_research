I have been taking my Jeep Wrangler in for service here for well over a year now. This is THE neighborhood automotive shop. First words to describe them are: Ethical, Respectful, Communicative, Intelligent, and no B.S.  These guys will talk to you and explain what's going on in the vehicle if you are interested. I've had quite a few cars and been to a variety of mechanics and dealerships. I can say from experience, I was surprised to not have an "Oh by the way - you need this too" every time I took my Jeep in for service - and I was waiting for it. Granted if they do notice something legitimate they will let you know - and they will also let you know a reasonable timeline on when the items should be fixed.  They have pride in their work and their work ethic. In any business, these can be such rare qualities. Bill C. and Bill H. - thank you both for all that you do!

This is our weekly destination for Vietnamese. North Scottsdale is limited on the Vietnamese options, but I believe this is the best in terms of good food, atmosphere, and service. Nice to sit on the patio when it's not boiling outside. The Spring Rolls are always fresh, the ice coffee is delicious, and the pho is great as well. The only con in my book is that the menu is small and missing the more adventurous parts of pho.

The five stars are for Debby - sales. And just Debby. Hard to find a car salesperson you WANT to work with. We will definitely go back to her in the future if she is still there. Just not going there for service - better have some background in automobiles if you dare. Perhaps we just got a hungry advisor. Reading other reviews, we have worked with Jason before (who is not our advisor) - but if you go in for service, ask for him.  **UPDATE. Jason Brown is now our advisor and he rocks!! A genuinely polite, intelligent, and professional person.

By far the best doctor's office I have ever been a patient of. The front office - Welcoming! Kind! Friendly! Personable! Everyone in this office whom I have dealt with has been polite. Dr. Muncy - also wonderful. You know doctors are busy - often back to back appointments if they aren't double booked as well. Dr. Muncy takes the time to listen and does not make you feel rushed. That being said, don't take advantage of your time slot :)

So-Happy! Thank goodness people and businesses like this DO still exist. Long story long: I have a cat. She needed a quick, albeit uncomfortable procedure done (office visit all of 20 mins) I have not one nice thing to say about my previous vet of 7 years who sent us away with very little concern or sympathy but they did render us a bill for a service they could not perform... so... that's that. From my first contact with N. Scottsdale Animal Hospital, I encountered professionalism, great customer service, and of all things, FRIENDLINESS! Oh my, how nice it is to speak to someone on the phone, in person, via email, any form of communication with a business that actually makes you feel like they give-a-hoot. Everyone had a great attitude: Reception (Brooke), Technician (James), our Veterinarian (Dr. Sosnow). Their experience and aptitude is clear and stress easing. Hard to find professionalism, knowledge, and a great attitude all in the same business... they've nailed it.  Happy cat, happy client -- Thank you!!

Bank of America customer for a decade until a few months ago. This particular branch is less than warming, as have most of my experiences been with BofA. Granted, not all experiences were bad. The time I went in to close my account the banker was relatively nice, although obviously bored. The last time, today, was after I went in to discuss my recently deceased father's account. (I have been working with another branch - 20th st and Camelback - they are GREAT, friendly, kind people to work with). Without going into more detail, the lady I talked to at the Raintree location was quick to point out how unhelpful they would be since I was no longer an account holder and I had just closed his account. Nor did she want to look into anything or offer any other options than get out and good luck. She was very good a pointing out what I could do if I did have an account with them though and all the hoops I'm going to have to jump through now that I didn't. All with a smile on her face. Condescending customer service. Take your business elsewhere.

Alex is irreplaceable. I have been going to Alex since 2007. At that time I had highlights, low lights, base color, my own roots for shades of color, and lots of long hair! I was tired of the maintenance and wanted to go back to my natural color. She was able to take all that mess and match my color to my roots perfectly. Whether it was a trim or a change up, I always left feeling like it was exactly what I wanted. She is full circle fantastic. Her salon is warm, earthy, and has great energy - quite like her. I will be a lifetime client for as long as she continues her passion!

Most experiences were fine, with the exception that they seemed a little inconsistent in their pricing. This was confirmed a few months ago when I dropped off a blue dress. My friend picked up the blue dress to borrow, wore it, returned it to be cleaned again. Pricing was an additional $5.00 the second time, for the exact same dress, no stains, nothing out of the ordinary. I showed the cashier my receipt from dropping off the dress the week before. No budge. Not even an effort to explain the pricing difference or an offer to honor the price. He just shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't know why the price was different. Unusual business ethic.

This location is actually why I switched back to Walgreens after so many years. The one a block away. I agree with the other reviews. Pharmacy is just plain rude. Horrible customer service.

I am an avid ramen noodle lover. The options were fantastic. I ordered the Chili Pepper Ramen "traditional style" and added an egg and off the menu spicy. Very few restaurants are willing to really make a dish spicy. I typically order this way at Thai restaurants and only 1 out of 5 of my favorite places has produced a dish that needed no extra spice. Republic ramen came through in the spice department. The tofu was not too squishy or soggy - just right and the veggies were not over cooked.  My bf had the Shoyu Ramen - original style - great flavor - no extra spice. We also had the seaweed salad which was also one of the best we've had. The seaweed flavor was not too strong. Finally, we had boba tea's - traditional black tea flavor. They were good, the flavor/consistency was not the best we've had - seemed a bit watered down, but would probably still stop by and grab one if we were in the area.

Fried zucchini! I'm surprised how few places offer fried zucchini - Tavern Grille does and they are delicious! I can also vouch for the burgers and steak salad. They have some pretty good happy hour specials, a variety of mac n cheese, and the house red is pretty decent as well.

I did it. Committed the over tweezed eyebrow crime. I have been a client of Amanda's for about a year now - but not for brows. There was no hesitation. Once I realized the error of my ways, I immediately called Amanda! Was able to seamlessly book an appointment and am happy to report I am on my way to brow recovery!   I've also been in to see her for the oxygen facial - which was an amazing experience. She has passion for her career, superior product knowledge, and pride in her work. Not to mention a positive attitude and just simply a pleasure to be around.   Thank you Amanda!

I'm a super fan. We have been quite a few times since their opening and have had a great experience each time. I'm no beer snob, so I can only attest that it tastes good and that my friends have no complaints. I typically get the Puppybird  or the Imperial Stout if I do get beer.   Now the food. I have yet to be let down. We have tried and loved the following: Wings (I am a wing snob, and these are amazing - I got the spicy, friend got the BBQ - both great), Mac N Cheese (Truffled Parmesan Crust - need I say more... ), Roasted Cauliflower with pork belly cracklin', Burger (cheese curds), Smothered Fries (topped with Pork Belly), and then the fried pickles. I do believe they have salads too.   Service has been a hoot. Always friendly and great personalities. Specifically Kersten and Brian (bartenders) - but everyone has been pretty great.   Plenty of Tv's. Open patio. USB ports on the outlets that are under the bar - genius!! My phone died and I happened to have the USB cord, but not the power adapter - first time I've seen a usb port available for customer use like this!    My only quarrel, if I could have one - is that there is only one dessert on the menu (and there are otter pops in the cooler by the door!). However, I do not come here for dessert and the name is 'Scottsdale BEER Company' so it's not really a valid expectation!
