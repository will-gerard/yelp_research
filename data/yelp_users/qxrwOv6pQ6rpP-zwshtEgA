I'm really not sure what the fuss is all about. We probably made the mistake of getting the margherita pizza which was pretty much cheese pizza with tomato slices and a little chopped basil. I expected slices of mozzarella and full leaves of basil. The breadsticks were bland and disappointing. My husband said papa johns is better and he hates papa johns. Even the bread pudding was just okay nothing special.

I just had my appointment today with Lindsay S. who was fantastic!  She was super helpful and very  respectful of my budget which I totally did not expect.  She was also great about getting my opinion in the dressing room away from my mom to make sure that I wasn't just trying to make my mom happy so if you have an opinionated mom (luckily mine isn't but she can seem that way) Lindsay does a great job of focusing on the fact that it's the bride's day.  The shop was very tidy, had plenty of seating room, tons of mirrors, and lots of natural light which I loved.  I couldn't decide on a dress but Lindsay wrote down the name and model number of the dresses so I could come back and know exactly what dresses I needed to try on.

Had a great haircut from Angi yesterday. My last hairstylist I felt like I had hit a dead end after 8 years and needed to try something new. I have tried 2-3 others but never really liked the results. A friend recommended Angi and I couldn't be happier. I wasn't sure what I wanted and Angi was great at suggesting something less drastic than I imagined to the relief of my husband who likes my hair long.   Watching Vinny in action helping his clients you could tell he really cares when he was suggesting iPhone apps that could make life easier in addition to some beautiful short haircuts.  I also love that you can book online and get reminders for your appointments.  JJ also does amazing gels that last forever and her artwork is gorgeous.

I absolutely love Chipotle and in the past this location has been fine but tonight was awful.  My boyfriend decided to order online which seemed like a great idea except when he got home I realized something wasn't right about my burrito before I even opened it up.  It was misshapen and even though I just removed half the foil the burrito just fell apart. It's like the contents were trying to escape the tortilla. So I gave up and tried to eat it with a fork when I realized the meat wasn't fully cooked, as in tasted raw in the center of those tiny pieces (of which the burrito was seriously lacking). While my boyfriend's dinner seemed fine, he also commented that something didn't taste quite right.    Do I have to watch you make my food to get a decent burrito?  I've worked in fast food and just because someone calls in an order it doesn't mean you get to be lazy.

Absolutely love this place. Great food and amazing lunch specials. My husband loves the tom kah soup and we usually share that and the panang or yellow curry. Pad thai is good too. If you come for lunch call before and order so when you arrive you can sit down to eat for a quick lunch.

I have no idea what happened to this place but both the food and service has gone downhill in the past 6 months or so. Now I have come to expect slow service like no one checking on if you need drink refills and inconsistent spice levels like tonight where I got the tom kha and panang both mild but the soup was bland and the curry spicy. But the best part was getting ONE tiny piece of bell pepper in the panang. Really?!

Absolute favorite breakfast place. The food the great and unpretentious. I usually just get over easy eggs and pancakes  so I hate fancy breakfast places, I just want to not have to worry about my eggs not being runny because I over cooked them again. Coffee is wonderful and they have vanilla creamer. Even better it's not expensive so it's a nice treat without buyers remorse.

Yummy food and good service. I had the tuna sandwich which was a nice change from the normal mayo soaked versions you get at most places.

Absolutely amazing!  Went on a Saturday afternoon and got lucky because it wasn't busy so we got a great table in the sunshine (a welcome escape from the Chicago winter).  The food was great and I had to stop myself from eating off my boyfriend's plate.  I got the Pilgrim since I love thanksgiving dinner and it was so delicious.  My boyfriend got the Tiki Masala (sp?) which I liked even though Indian food isn't normally my thing.  Definitely going back there every time I'm in town now.

Food is pretty good here. I always get the gyro and my husband likes one of the chicken wraps. We usually call in the order and bring it home since it's always packed in the evenings.   The salmon is also really good for a healthy option.

This was my third visit to get a massage and my last one was quite awhile ago so a lot of things have changed. The first two experiences were great but this one was so disappointing. I ended up in a room in the back which must have been next to the break room. Constantly through my massage I was interrupted by loud talking and laughing. I understand having a fun work place but it didn't allow me to truly relax. The massage felt more like when I go to the  chiropractor than a relaxing and stress relieving massage. While my husband did have the noise issue, he also remarked on how the quality of the massages just wasn't what they used to be.

This is an amazing store if you want a great deal on a dress.  I went twice and the second time, Helen was my consultant and she was fabulous.  I'm not great at picking out dresses for my help and she grabbed several dresses right away so I didn't walk out frustrated because bridal dresses are hard to judge in their garment bags.  Also I was able to put down a deposit (it's usually $50 but mine was a bit more since my dress is $1200) and pull the dress off the floor for a week so I could think about it and email my mom in California and get her opinion.  The prices are great and don't be frustrated if you don't find your dress the first time since they are always getting new stuff in.

The staff here is competent but their practice of writing prescriptions as dispense as written for brand name drugs that a generic would work just fine is unacceptable and they won't just write on my chart that I prefer generics like most offices. I don't care if the coupon makes it the same price because the activations are such a pain.

Coming from California, I miss great sandwiches. This definitely isn't the same but is best thing I've found so far. I pick up lunches here all the time for the office and I can't wait to use them instead of Paradise Bakery for a sandwich platter.

Not sure why my review for Italian Restaurant ended up under Pizzeria Bianco so I want to fix this. Love pizzeria Bianco but go for lunch. Dinner is way too busy.

Our dog has been to several groomers but usually after a few times they start getting sloppy. This is the third time we have been and each time it's been great and he looks just groomed for at least 4 weeks which is much longer than anywhere we've been.   Today we mixed up the appointment date and they let us bring him in a little later with no problem.

I took their crochet class here. They didn't have a time that worked for me but they let me set up a time that worked as long as I brought two other people and it was still open to the public which was nice. We had one other girl join us. The class was okay a couple of us just needed a refresher but the one person who had never done it really struggled.   The store does a really nice job of explaining yarn and needles when you go in and you can but materials before the class or bring them in.

Slow service, margarita pizza was a cheese pizza with some basil on top, and even though the restaurant was practically empty they couldn't get 6 pizzas out to the table hot and at the same time. The only saving grace was a decent tiramisu and if you are a soccer fan they actually watch it here.

Great store with quality products minus the crazy baby store and actually had what I wanted in stock. If you are looking for just the quality items and avoid a bunch of plastic junk then this is the spot. Instead of messing with coupons, they just give you the best price upfront.
