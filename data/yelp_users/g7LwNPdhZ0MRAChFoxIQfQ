After driving to Phoenix from Minneapolis, I was in desperate need of a new set of tires. A friend recommended this location as being very good. I agree. I had several and complicated requests to be done to my vehicle, and the gentleman assisting me (even with a line of customers waiting to be served) waited to fully understand what was being asked of him. He did understand, and he even gave me a discount on labor costs. Customer service was excellent, and when I waited longer than the quoted time, he completed the work himself in order to fulfill our agreement. I have worked in the tire industry in the past, and I will return to this location.

Worth every penny. I discovered this business by chance, and I'm glad I did. I enjoy a difficult haircut, and I had grown accustomed to sub par results. My experience is with the employee Adrian Romaine, and I recommend his service to anyone in need of superior performance. You'll pay more for the service, but the overall value can't be beat!

I decided to give Back to Basic a try based on the review from this site, and I'm glad that I did. Driving up to the building, the neighborhood looks questionable, and the building itself is nothing special, but the employees make up for it. Both people I interacted with were friendly and personable. The person actually doing the work on my vehicle was knowledgeable, professional and efficient. He also stated that the company is a family oriented business and frowns upon the corporate "bottom line" business model. The work was well done and the cost was reasonable.

I love this church! I'm kind of surprised that this is the first review... Since moving to Phoenix from Minneapolis, I've explored several churches in an attempt to find a church comparable to Eagle Brook Church in Lino Lakes, MN. I unequivocally found a replacement with Central Christian. Specifically, I attend the Third Format service on Saturday nights at 6:30pm. This is a non-denominational christian church with all the beliefs one would expect from a christian church. On approach, the building(s) are modern in appearance and very large. Parking spaces abound, and the area is safe. While walking to the main worship center, you pass the children's center, a cafe and a bookstore. Once inside, the dress is casual, and the mood is electric. This service is tailored to a much more edgy crowd, and it is not like a service you may have expected: Rock-like worship music, Lights, Fog, People excitedly yelling out, and it's loud! Everything is so passionate. I love it! And It's addictive... In a good way. Five stars. If it's your first time visiting, I'll go with you. Let me know.

First of all, I'd like to say that I am in no way a fan of "Big Business" of any kind e.g. National Chain stores, Big Box stores and the like. That being said, it is at times persuasively difficult to assuage the obvious convenience. So on with the review!  Or more specifically, the person being reviewed. Her name is Margaret (Maggie) Flanagan, and she is a Personal Banker at this branch. On first impression, she is warm, inviting and personable. Subsequent visits confirm legitimacy and add genuineness. She is a good fit for her position. She is accurate, professional and has the ability to take an inherently cold topic, money, and bring a little life into it. She is worth the drive or call in order to navigate other than superficial banking needs.  4 stars due to my obvious bias with her community destroying affiliation with Big Business.

Needing a wheel bearing to be pressed on the front hub assembly of my vehicle, I was sent to this location as having the correct press to complete this end. After approaching a store representative and explaining my need, I was turned away. I contacted the person who sent me, and he said "it must be a mistake", and recommended I return to inquire again. I did, and asked some harder questions. In the process, I caught the man in a lie and called him on it. He then became confrontational, and I took my business elsewhere.
