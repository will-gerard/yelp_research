This place sucks. I've given it multiple chances. Always out of something you want, slow service, busy all the time (for what reason i dont know).  I attempted to get a 3 piece meal with a breast thigh and leg. The cashier kept asking me white or dark meat. I finally just said white meat as i couldnt get it through his skull that i wanted those 3 specific pieces which is obviously a mix of white and dark.  2 stars only because while everything else is crap about this place, the food quality is consistent with KFCs all around and the employee was friendly albeit dense as a brick wall.  Won't be coming back

Great brunch to start the day off in downtown Vegas! Affordable prices, quality, fresh ingredients, delicious food and wonderful staff.  The soundtrack/music is excellent too! Highly recommend! Don't miss this brunch! Andi, our server, was pleasant, fun, and a great person!

I don't know why this place has 4+ stars. It doesn't make logical sense. The hummus on the "Mediterranean" board is over spiced with garlic and some sort of vinegar/olive juice or brine which is not how classic hummus is prepared. The olives were hot for some reason, another mystery. I'm not sure the menu creator has ever been inside a true Greek or Mediterranean establishment as this is a poor representation of their culture. We sent it back and had calamari instead. You can't go wrong with fried food as it is inherently easy to cook. They were obviously the kind that were precooked and frozen however so that was slightly unappealing as well.  We ordered the strawberry fields chicken salad and the "Rachael" sandwich for lunch. The dressing for the salad tasted like strawberry milk and should have been more of a true vinaigrette than a cream sauce. The chicken was over seasoned with most of the seasoning burnt and charred to the breast with a slight chemical taste. Not sure what that is about as salads are also hard to mess up.  The "Rachael" pastrami sandwich was good, not great. Fairly greasy but it is pastrami so that could be expected. The meat is brined in house for 21 days or more which adds to the flavor and overall appeal.  The beers were great, though and probably the only saving grace.   If you have never visited an alehouse, brewery, or pub, don't open one and expect people to flock to it. For example places like Ohso, four peaks and  san tan are leading examples of what your standard brewery/restaurant should be like, and this establishment simply is not up to par.
