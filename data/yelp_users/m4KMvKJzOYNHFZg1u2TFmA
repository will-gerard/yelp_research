I needed help. One of my students chose underwater welding as his career choice and I wanted him to have dive equipment as part of his presentation.  Saguaro stepped in to help and made his presentation awesome. Kindness, real people, care. The dive shop is awesome in every way but the heart of the people who own it and work there is outstanding. All I can say is a big fat THANK YOU!!  You may have helped changed the path of a child. There is no price for that kind of service.

First time at this location.  Ate lunch Monday.  I ordered "J" which is a chicken burrito covered with their creamy/spicy cream cheese sauce served with rice and beans.  Really delicious dish and HUGE.  I took 1/2 home and ate it for dinner.  Adorable and pleasant waiter - great service.  Chips and water at our table within 1 minute of sitting down.  Restaurant clean.  No complaints!

What can I say.  I live in Germany but grew up in Arizona and was raised on El Charro  The recipes haven't changed in 50 years and they are delicious.  Is the restaurant fancy?  NO.  Are the servers the kiss your butt kind that you get at Chili's?  NO, is it new and modern? NO.  Guess what?  Doesn't matter. The food is delicious, consistant (after 50 years of sampling it) and it is always as expected.  I have never had anything but a good time there.  Love the draft beer in the same glasses as forever, the amazing cheese crisps served on a metal plate, and "B" soft is always my choice.  I love the place and if it ever closes a piece of my heart goes with it.  What a fabulous Mesa tradition and establishment.  Keep it open forever.  I am a fan as is  my entire, large family.

I wrote a polite note on the El Charro Facebook page indicating my dissatisfaction of the fact they have been closed "for family reasons" for 5 now, almost 6 months.  Instead of a businesslike response, my post was copied and pasted along with the sarcastic,  typo ridden response from the owners presumably telling a 50+ year customer to "take it or leave it"  The El Charro response evoked a lot of sympathy from other readers saying "take as long as you need"  I stand by my post:  6 months is too long to close a business and expect to have loyal customers return.    Although my original post gives my old favorite restaurant 5 stars.  My new rating is zero.  I don't think I will ever return.

Popped in for pasta last night. The pizza is always good but I wanted to try something else. The penne with meatballs was huge and very reasonably priced. The cheesy garlic bread at 1.49 was also a deal! Fast service, huge portions and good prices. Nice neighborhood restaurant!

I have been taking my dogs to Top Dog for over a year.  I go regularly, every other month.  Debbie usually does one dog and someone else at the shop the other dog.  I am always happy with their service.  The price is right, and they take really good care of the dogs.  Thanks TOP DOG!

Doesn't rain in too much in Arizona but today it did. My wipers were in tatters on the verge of shredding off, popped in in a Sunday to this place I honestly didn't even know was there. Guided immediately into a bay then into the store to buy the wipers. Helped outside and in by two uber-pleasant men. Paid for the blades and they were installed in 2 minutes. I swear from entering to exit I was there less than 5 minutes. Talk about great service!

To be fair I have only eaten breakfast here but have been back again and again and again.  The portions are large, the food is good and hearty and the 4 egg omelets are the best anywhere.  Fluffy, always cooked to perfection and delicious.  The other day I had the chicken friend steak for breakfast with eggs and gravy it too was wonderful.  The restaurant used to be in a different location.  They have recently moved to the Higley location and the place is spotless and with all new everything.  It is always busy or almost full but because the service is good people move in and out and we have never had a problem getting a table.  From my perspective this place is just an awesome breakfast stop, a place you can go every weekend.  The staff is friendly and nice, the owner is always around greeting people and being accessible.  Good work and thanks for being in Mesa where places like this one are few and far between.

I was starving for a steak-- a friend said to try RWB. I brought my daughter and we were not disappointed. I had the ribeye and  she had the sirloin with coconut shrimp. The waiter (Michael) suggested we have the steaks crusted. We did, they were cooked perfectly, crusted with a garlicky olive tapenade then broiled. Pure perfection. Bread was delicious as were our sides. In truth though, the salad was just so so, not 5 star but the rest of the meal made up for it. Ended up seeing friends there and having a wonderful night. Thanks Red White And Brew for scratching my steak itch.

We used a deal chicken which was a very good value as the menu items vary from 15-33 dollars.  Rather expensive for a Mexican restaurant.  We had a wonderful reception when we arrived. We were greeted by two different people.  Seating was timely and very pleasant.  Our waiter came immediately to our tables, got us started on our Margaritas and brought the included Fundido appetizer which was very good.  Contrary to other reviewers we did get a basket of chips and salsa as well as fresh tortillas within a few minutes of being seated.  The Margaritas are big and really good.  Again, to get 2 each was a great deal.  Our waiter, Trent, was very pleasant, efficient and nice.  No bad attitude about the deal chicken voucher.  I had the taco plate, shrimp, beef and chicken served with beans, rice and 3 more tortillas.  Good but a lot to eat!  My daughter had a spicy chicken dish, she really liked it but, like me, said it was too much food.  It seems the reviews here are based on the poor service as opposed to the quality of food but I have to give the establishment 5 stars because I can't fault to service in the least.  They really went out of their way to make sure we had a good time.  We sat inside, too hot outside, but there were 20 or more people enjoying the evening on the beautiful patio under the mister system.  Would I go back?  Yes, with a deal chicken.  Had we paid full price the dinner would have been over $100 total  including the drinks which to me is too pricy for a Mexican restaurant.

We did not play golf but had lunch at the Trophy room.  All I can say is WOW.  There is a chef in the kitchen and not a cook.  Amazing burgers, beyond fantastic.  Good wine, terrific service.  I don't usually plan a repeat visit but this place is on my list.  It was one of the best lunches I have ever had in the valley.  Beautiful views, uber clean, busy but not crowded.  A really nice place to go.  Prices are not cheap --- 10$ for a burger plate but worth every cent.  Go to restaurant.com and I am sure you can buy a coupon to save a few bucks.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Hard for a place like this one to live up to the hype but they do.  We sat outside, which arguably this time of year in Phoenix is amazing.  The patio is really beautiful, clean, comfortable chairs and lots of pretty flowers blooming.  Two of us arrived and the waitress immediately came over to greet us after having been promptly seated by the hostess.  We told her we were waiting for one more guest and ordered bottomless mimosa's.  The yummy drinks arrived promptly and we were refilled before our other guest arrived 10 minutes later.  We arrived at 935 and the patio was close to full.  So, if you are coming for Sunday Brunch, come when they open, 930, if you want a seat outside.  The place was very full in and out when we left. And yes, they do have free valet parking.   We ordered the green chili corn bread as an appetizer, it was tasty, moist (hate that word) and delicious.    We ordered our brunch meals, one order of eggs benedict and two orders of chilaquiles.  It took a long time for the food to arrive (30 minutes) but no matter, we were chatting away, enjoying the day and they were keeping our drinks full.   The food arrived, the Chiliaquilas (that may be spelled wrong) were outstanding.  Picture a mexican style lasagna, packed with shredded chicken, cheeses, chilis and the noodles are corn tortillas.  Topped with a wonderful pico de gallo sauce and served on a plate with 1/2 red and 1/2 green sauce.  Truly a taste sensation.  We saw other food coming out of the kitchen and everything looked really yummy.  The eggs benedict was served with a generous portion of fresh fruit and was also yummy and well prepared.   Bill came shortly after our plates were cleared but the very pleasant server advised us to sit as long as we wanted and enjoy the mimosas refills and the beautiful weather.  We were at Chelsea's more than 2 hours and had a really smashing time.   Don't come here if you are looking for cheap prices, it isn't outrageous but our brunch did end up costing 97$ for 3 people.  Lots of drinks and great food and an appetizer.  I can't afford to spend every weekend at Chelsea's during the beautiful spring weather but I sure wish I could!  Great place!

I'm not sure if I'm just lucky but my experience with Norwegian Cruise lines has been seamless.  They delivered all that they promised and a good price they even upgraded us to a mini suite when we made the request. Went on the boat there was an issue about the onboard credit I was supposed to receive and they quickly emailed to confirm that it was in fact their error I have absolutely no complaints with them.

Not impressed with this RA.  I have eaten many times at the RA downtown San Diego and a few times in Scottsdale.  This location I have tried 3 times.  The rolls are good but pricy. The last time i was there the roll was super fishy smelling and not good.  Today I had a bento box lunch special and the chicken teriyaki was so freezer burned and dry it was practically un-edible.  I had two pieces and quit.  The rest of the box wasn't fresh.  The salad was rusted and bruised and the potsticker was old and dried out.  I give them a solid "F" on this box.  Atmosphere is nice, the service is good and attentive.  Overall, for the price, I will go someplace else.

Great merchandising-- the store is clean, well organized and full. Stopped in to get things for my students. Buying of course with my own money... Had over the limit of 10 and despite my MPS badge the manager refused. So, they tout family first-- I call em out. Kids are not a priority. Joanne's wins. Sorry hobby lobby. You've received my last $

This is not bonafide Mexican cuisine but of course they do a good job somethings on the menu are not particularly fantastic but the Pollo fundido is very good as are the salsas. All  I can say at the end of this review is Maria Maria Maria.  She is a bartender that works in the evening and she is fantastic if you sit at the bar she'll take care of you!

Gotta say re-cheesing is bad!  We ordered drinks after a pretty long wait, then ordered 'ultimate nachos with steak' when we were able to flag down our waiter. One hour after we arrived no nachos. We flagged down the chip delivery guy and told him our quandary. Not 3 minutes later our nachos arrived. Softly melted cheese, cold sour cream Guacamole. Thinking we scored a great plate of nachos we dug in. Underneath the beautiful cheese was petrified cheese fused to both the chips and the plate. Knowing now that when faced with a super late order the kitchen was willing to try and fake us out with a scraped off and re-cheesed plate of nachos completely erodes my confidence in the establishment. Talked to the manager at the end. He admitted he knew they had scraped off the old cheese and re-cheesed them but assured us "it wasn't him".  He took the nachos off our bill and gave us a rather grumpy 'sorry'.

This is my neighborhood go to place for a quick margarita and food and today didn't  disappoint.  Quick service from bartender. Chips salsa and bean dip within 3 minutes. Ordered a burro ala carte with green sauce, it came out super fast and super hot. Delicious. Not a single issue. Only reason they received 4 stars instead of 5 is because of prior experience. I have to hope Yelp is responsible for the improved EVERYTHING. Thanks, Garcias for getting back on your game!    PRIOR VISIT:   Gotta say re-cheesing is bad!

Been to Nando's at least 25 times.  Both the big restaurant and the "Hideaway" for breakfast.  I always see the same employees, people are always friendly and fast.  I love the happy hour food -- the mexican Pizza is awesome.  I love the beans, the enchiladas, the chips, the salsa.  The house margaritas are strong and delicious.  Yes, the food is cheesy and Americanized but it is delicious!  I have rarely seen such consistency in a restaurant.  This place will be around for a long time.  Excellent management and organization.

I have heard good things about their concerts and the nightlife dance scene. I skipped that and took my German husband there for lunch.  Gals at front dressed in uber skimpy outfits which may be a male attraction.  All of them seemed rather clueless.  We sat at the bar and after having the bar tender walk past us 5 or 6 times with no greeting of any kind we were informed the "Kitchen was totally backed up because someone called in sick" thus no orders were being accepted.  I found this rather strange because there were only 10 people eating.  Surely one cook could handle the "rush."  Anyway, we didn't eat and just ordered beer.  Had four grossly overpriced, beers.  Almost impossible to get the bar tenders attention.  Getting check was a chore, getting our credit card run was a chore.  The place wasn't busy at all.  Seemed everyone who worked in this very large joint was touting a 2 digit IQ.  I won't be back.

I feel like I am on a customer service rant. Yet another great store marred by their bad customer service. First girl I talked to didn't have any idea where Pinot noir was. Sent me down an isle that was 15 isles away from where it actually was located. Next guy I tried to talk to barely had one second to look up from to his uber important computer screen to answer my question. I did however get a one word grunt.  Berry- the manager apparent-- walked past me twice yapping into his Bluetooth phone but never once acknowledging my presence in his store. If you enjoy 100% self service, this is the store for you. The reason they earned 2 stars is for price and the friendly and competent cashier.  Today was the last time I will give them my 120$ hard earned dollars.

Food: This is a two part review covering two visits.  My daughter recently moved way out East Mesa so JJ's was my "local bar" recommendation having been there several times in the past.  So a few weeks ago we needed a break from box unpacking and drove down to eat.  We sat at the bar, the place was very full.  Ordered a couple of cold beers and decided on food.  Jen had the all you can eat cod special (8.99$ or so) and I had a the all you can eat roasted, smoked pig.  It was in fact a full pig the chef had smoked out back then brought into the restaurant (still on the now cool smoker)  He had shredded the meat into mouthwatering delicious pork.  He makes all the sides home made (some from his mom's recipes he tells me) Cheesy, creamy scalloped potatoes, cole slaw, yummy baked beans, homemade sauce, potato salad.  I am pretty sure the feast was a measly 10.99$ for a really outstanding plate of food.  Its buffet style and he doesn't scrimp on portions of meat.  If you want to try a really awesome meal, come super hungry and enjoy!  Cod was also delicious too.   Then today, a few weeks later, we went back again. This time sitting at one of the tables.  I am happy to report they have brand spanking new menus with a really wide variety of offerings.  one section has burgers -- 21 of them.  I had the # 20 --- double 1/4 inch patties with double cheese and fries.  The other order was # 20, again double 1/4 inch patties, hers with pepper jack cheese and green chilis.  Both burgers were mouth watering great. Cooked perfectly too.   Ambiance:  This is a casual sports bar/restaurant.  Way more than a bar but with a bar feel.  They have -- if I counted correctly 32 flat screen TV's.  (no blaring thank goodness) They have every sport imaginable on TV as well as offering off track betting.  They also offer free wireless game consoles to guests so you can play trivia games again the others using the devices or play poker or an individual game.  Very modern and fun.  We had them and played trivia against each other while we ate.  A nice extra touch.   Service:  I can't say it was great. A little slow getting to us initially and brining our check however the waitress did stop by twice to refill our pepsi's and check on our food. Plates were cleared away promptly as well.  This isn't five star service but it wasn't expected.    Overall, if you live in Mesa, JJ's is a great place to stop for a cold one, eat some complimentary peanuts, catch a game or just relax with friends (nice outdoor patio as well) The food is far superior to similar places and outranks the likes of Applebees type restaurants by a mile. We will be there again soon.

Greeted immediately despite the place being very busy. I had an appointment at the Genius Bar at 1200 - arrived on time and was served right away. My computer had a problem that made it do everything super slow-- expert, Andrew, was super patient very knowledgeable. Left the computer was told it would be ready the next day. Got a call a few hours later informing me it was done.  Apple has great products and they keep me buying them with their quality and first class service.

Usually I love Lowes. Higher product line superior customer service. Today I was doing a big shopping with my daughter who just bought a new home in this area. 2 hours in the store and not a single person asked to help us. I did however have employees walk past when I said "excuse me."  The 'pretending not to hear' cost you a couple of good customers. Oh, and check out was super slow too!

I have been here gobs and gobs of times. Taco Tuesday is my day. $2.00 tacos-- I always have the breaded shrimp taco with cabbage on a flour tortilla. Never disappointed.  The place gets really busy on Tuesdays by about 5:00 so be warned. They have a nice big outdoor patio and great drink prices for happy hour too. Only negative is service can be pretty spotty at busy times. Today-- early everything is awesome and the taco is delicious as ever!

*  Hostesses are children trying to act like adults *  Service is slow (painfully slow) *  Employees all have an attitude and not a good one *  Mediocre food *  Watered down drinks *  Expensive drinks *  Overall dirty and sticky *  Restrooms on one corner of the structure which is about 100 yards from some tables. *  Need I say more?

The one absolute consistent thing about this store is its ability to always disappoint me. The pharmacist is rude, the lines are always way too long and the service desk is a joke. I live nearby so always seem to give them another chance." But, after 25 or so disappointing visits over three years I am done.

I bought a groupon in May.  They were too busy to honor it.  So I waited until August.  I have tried to reach them for 3 months and they never return phone calls or emails.  If you want to get flat out ripped off, use Extremecleaning.  They are the pros at cleaning your wallet of money!

I love local places born and raised in Mesa and not the crap the chains offer.  This place is funky, fun, and the food is good and fresh.  Lots of cool people there too.  I have been there several times and a few times ago ordered the family pack which is plenty of food for 5 people.  Thanks for brining a new place to our neighborhood!

Came here three weeks ago and had the best experience. Long massage, great paint job. Came back today and unluckily got the man. He seemed to barely know what he was doing. Callus removal wasn't nearly as good as the last time. Guy is rough with your legs and feet, not relaxing at all. A little better during the massage however. He got crud all over my pulled over the knee pants.  Everything seemed rushed --- he couldn't find supplies was up and down 10 times. Oh and there was a small flood from the chair where my daughter was sitting which wasn't their fault but caused a twenty minute break in the action. Water got cold.  He fixed it with super hot water then cold water. Struggled with the concept of warm water. Recommendation? Get one of the girls, if you get the mustached owner-- say you will wait. From class A last time to C- this time I learned my lesson. Too bad--- I thought I had found "the place."

I purchased a kitchen remodel from Home Depot.  The cabinets and countertops cost approximately $6000.  They use GreenCraft Interiors as the installer of choice.  GreenCraft came over, measured, did the plans and wrote the bid.  Without dissecting the entire over inflated big, one big ticket item included was demolition and removal of the old kitchen cabinets.  GreenCraft's bid for this service was $1,780.00    There are a total of 8 cabinets.  To make a long story short, I used Starburst Building Suppiy (a non profit business) to have the demolition done.  Cost?  $125.00.  The two gentlemen they sent were clean, professional and efficient.  They were here a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes, removed counters, cabinets, countertops, disconnected plumbing, appliances and swept the kitchen.  GreenCraft interiors charges over $1500 an hour for this service.  Home Depot's manager defended their pricing policy though was unable to explain why a figure of almost $1,800 dollars was justified for one hour and 15 minutes worth of work.  I am not suggesting GreenCraft is shoddy or does bad work, I have no evidence of that fact.  I am suggesting however, they pad their bills, overcharge customers and have no qualms of making gigantic windfalls from unsuspecting persons.  Use them with caution, review the bid, get second opinions from other contractors before you use them.  They cannot be trusted.

Slow service ---very unorganized.  I know they are new but...   Dirty dishes left on the tables after people left their table.  Dirty dishes left on the table while people were paying their bills.  No one seems trained or professional at their job.  We had a waitress, she brought our drinks and took our order then 20 minutes later another waitress came and said "sorry you had to wait so long, what can I get for you"  She was apparently unable to see we already had our coffee.   I had a cheese omelet (not on the menu -- I had to ask for it) and it was fine.  My friend had a vegetable omelet and she said it was bland and bad.  The breakfast "experience" took over an hour.  Over 30 minutes to get our food.  We had to stand up to finally get a bill. When I went inside there were three young hostesses standing at the hostess stand doing exactly nothing except talking amongst themselves.  People were waiting outside to get a table, there were dirty dishes everywhere but three employees had time to stand around and do nothing.   No one was watching the farm for sure.  As a restaurant owner I see more details perhaps than a normal customer and in this case?  "A" for location.  "B" for ambiance but the rest will put them out of business within a year.  Sorry Sunnyside, I had great hopes for you but I am going back across the street to the well oiled machine called Nandos Hideaway for breakfast.

We know Poncho's and the chain Someburros and heard the family was opening a new spot so we had to try it.  The restaurant is located at Williams Field and Val Vista on the Northwest corner.  It is set back a bit from the road.    We were greeted promptly by a pleasant hostess upon entering.  We asked to sit out side and she seated us at a table with a bench cushion on one side and a regular chair at the other side.  After sitting for a minute or two we moved to a different table in the sun.  We received our chips and salsa very quickly as well as water.  The waiter and bus person both seemed very eager to please.  The chips and sauce were good -- not salsa but a red sauce.  I had a house margarita which is served in a mason jar.  Very good -- 7$    The regular menu has a lot of what I would call non-traditional mexican dishes as well as some items like burros and tacos which are more familiar.  The lunch menu has 5 items priced at either 8$ or 10$.  My friend had the green burro with beans and rice off the lunch menu 10$ and I had the Carnitas Torta off the regular menu -- 9$  The waiter made a point of telling me "the dishes are all traditional Mexican food -- there is no americanization of the food."  I asked if the torta came with beans and he said no, it comes with thick fries.  So, immediately contradicting himself -- no traditional Mexican food I have ever eaten comes with French Fries.  Anyway, I digress..  The torta was really a sandwich, carnitas (a little dry and too chewy) lettuce, tomato, avocado, onions and some mayo sauce.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing, it was just OK.  My friend had the green chili burro and we both tried it and it was delicious albeit a bit on the small side for 10$.  The beans were excellent.    The decor is tasteful with lots of neat touches everywhere.  The restaurant is not overly large but has a nice patio which probably seats 34-40 people.  They were not busy today -- only 2 other tables while we were there.  The staff outnumbered the customers 3 to 1.     We both found the service a bit on the suffocating side.  Checking back constantly, talking too long at the table, etc.  We both prefer simple efficient service, bring a wonderful product and then let us enjoy it.      I really hope this place is a great success, it has all the right ingredients -- I think a few kinks have to be worked out and perhaps the menu needs to be a little more mainstream and lower priced.  Most of the entries on the regular menu were between 13-16$ which is a lot for Mexican food.    Would we come back?  Maybe, if we were in the area.  Would I drive from NE Mesa to eat at Isabel's?  Not likely.

I am more than satisfied. Lynette is super caring and smart. She was efficient and kind which explains why she is so busy!  The place was a little out of my way but so worth the drive. She is going to be on my monthly radar for skincare.  I had an IPL photo facial and derma plane procedure. Will she try to sell you skin care products? Yes. Are the products she offers great? Also yes. Price no different than sephora or any counter at the mall.  I recommend her 100%

We came here, loved the first Car we looked at. Really liked our salesman, johnathan, despite liking the car and J, we went to four other dealers and got the run around and poor salesmanship from all of them. We came back here today and found the car my daughter wanted, we are in the dealing process.  First round, cost too high.  We shall see how round two goes and whether we can make a deal.  Ok, 30 minutes later... Deal done!  Very nice finance manager,  Thomas, very normal and fair.  Next comes the dealer ad on ... Finance. Chris. Was super energetic,fast and efficient. Whole experience was completely positive. Highly recommend.

I am a native Arizonan so of course I had been to the old Minder Binders when it was just a big red barn sitting in a field.  I knew it was re-done recently and so decided to try it out with my sister in law and niece and nephew.  I didn't recognize the place because it is so different on the outside.  A huge patio has been built with outdoor seating for well over 100 guests.  There is an open kitchen to this patio area so servers can quickly grab meals and guests can see and smell the food being prepared.  We ate inside at one of the old booths in the "Barn" and all the memorabilia is in tact!  The place looks awesome!  A new bar has been added, back lit with glass blocks.  Everyone was very excited about the decor and the unusual atmosphere.  One of those places you really have to see to understand.  I had a taco salad which was very good.  Lots and lots of meat!  My guests ordered two different burgers and Sarah had the pepperoni pizza.  The pizza looked delish!   Everyone said their food was prepared well and tasted great.  It is not 5 star dining but for this kind of establishment very good.  The menu is large with appetizers, pizza, burgers and salads taking center stage.  Service was good, waitress was helpful and efficient.  Overall I have absolutely no complaints and i will for sure go back. Prices range in the 8-13$ range.  The history, the careful and super well done renovation make it well worth a visit.  Oh, and last but not least -- restroom for women was big, clean, new and very nice!

Cool little family run place. Order at the counter and they bring food to your table. Nice little Mexican ambiance too. Great for a quick bite. They have beer and sangria too!
