Expect to pay casino prices for decent Mexican food. Had the fajitas and shrimp burrito.  Lots of shrimp in the burrito is a plus.   I took away a star because one shouldn't have to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant.  They also charged for a side of pico de gallo. Don't nickel and dime patrons paying $20 for a burrito.

There are many criteria in which to judge a Dr., their office, and their staff.  My short list is:  Dr's knowledge of his specialty Personalized service (Not feeling like a sheep getting herded out asap) The office staff experience Wait time as compared to your appointment time Cost  I consider myself a stringent consumer as I educate myself in whatever product or service I am buying, and I hold the experience to a high standard. Phoenician Health gets 5 stars in each of the previous categories.   Dr. Majidi knows much more about the body than a chiropractor would be required to. His passion for the body shows through his work. He gives each patient very personalized service and you always end up having a good conversation about your health including nutrition and exercise. He is also a DJ so feel free to ask him about music.   The office staff is always friendly and welcoming. They manage the patient load efficiently and you never find yourself sitting in the lobby waiting well past your appointment time.   I have been a cash patient as well as an insurance patient here and never felt like I was even paying what one would expect given the current state of health care.  The office includes other services as well including massage / phyisical therapy (My insurance covers these, what a treat), Homeopathic treatment, and even weight management.   I highly recommend Phoenician Health if you are looking for a quality medical experience.
