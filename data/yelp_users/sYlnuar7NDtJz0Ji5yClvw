I was sceptical about Lasik Surgery and uncomfortable about having anything done to my eyes, but I'm tired of wearing glasses. So I went in for an exam and they really put my mind at ease. Dr. Campion explained the procedure and I felt better about having them do the work.  His staff was great to work with as well. I'm a business man and I like doing business with professionals who are responsive to your needs.  I'm thrilled that I got this done. It's a little strange not putting the glasses on and I even look a little different now that I don't wear glasses anymore.  It's pretty cool! :) Big smiles :)

I had a BBQ Beef Sandwich at Chase's Diner today. Good food as well as good fries. This is one of those 50's style diners that's fun to eat at. I also like the sign I read when eating there that stated, All Unattended Children Will Be Given an Espresso and a New Puppy.  Hilarious.

BW'S is a family favorite. That's not just a slogan. My kids are Gluten free and there are not a whole lot of places I can take them for dinner.  They can eat the chicken wings no sauce and we are all addicted to their fries.  I know Gail the owner. She used to have a play kitchen in her restaurant for the kids but unfortunately corporate made her remove it. She tries to create an atmosphere where parents can bring their kids and they don't have to stress out about making them behave like 70 year old ladies. It makes it a little more relaxing for us.  And besides the food I love being able to watch sports while I'm with my family. Good Stuff, Thanks Gail

Love the Green Chille Burger. Can't say about the other food because I haven't tried anything else. Last time I went the fries were undercooked, but you can ask them to cook them well done.  They have great fries but for some reason they decided not to cook them as much.  Great atmosphere, with several easy to see T.V.s

So Incredibly disappointed at the total lack of any business sense they showed tonight. I went there with my 3 kids tonight and I forgot my wallet. I had a credit card in my truck that didn't work because I never use it, so I called my wife.  They wanted to hold our food until my wife got there. I offered my I-Pad, and or truck keys as collateral and they still didn't budge. What a bunch of idiots. You've got a good customer who's in a little bit of a jam and he can't pay for his meal for 10 minutes and you don't just give him and his kids their food? Such incredible poor judgement. I was ticked off I left and we went to DQ instead.

I always loved Johnny Rockets, the food, the fun - my daughter always gets up and dances with the crew.  Tonight- not so much - The service was horible. They lost our order and the manager didn't even have the courage to come out and appologize. They gave me a pathetic discount which didn't begin to make up for the 1/2 hour I lost this evening. The worst part for me was I was in a great mood when I went there even though we waited for 20 minutes to get in. But it's hard to maintain your cool when you people around you who came in 15 minutes after you get served first.  I understand that mistakes happen, believe me they happen to me in my business all the time. That's when the manager has to come over and own up to the error and appologize.  If you go there share this review with them and maybe they will improve, because the food really is good and normally I like the place a lot, but shame on them tonight.

The manager called me and appologized and sent us a gift card for a free meal.  I do like their food and I love their atmosphere. My 5 year old daughter always gets up and dances with their servers. It's a lot of fun.  I wish I would have contacted them before writing a bad review and give them a chance to step up. They did make a mistake with us that night and companies deserve an opportunity to know and make it right.  They did do that.

I've always loved Johnny Rockets and the service tonight was ok, but the last few times we've been there the food has been awful.  It was prepared ok but the flavor is that of a good McDonalds, which is really sad.  I don't complain to gripe but I hope someone who cares sees this reviews and makes a better effort.  I see this restaurant closing very soon because I just think they care anymore. There's a serious lack of effort lately.

I went to go to Subway and Lobby's was next door and I always like to try out new places and support a small business whenever I can.  The Bacon Chesse Burger was excellent and the fries were hot and crispy without me having to ask, which is really unusual.  The price was a little on the high side, but the food was really good and I wish them all the best.

Took the kids out for diner and wanted something different. I kept driving buy Five Guys on the Way to California Pizza Kitchen and I always wanted to try it out. So we decided to try it this evening.  The atmosphere is fantastic. They give peanuts out for free and you can throw the shells on the floor, so the kids had a blast. The soda machine is really cool too. Like nothing I've ever seen with a huge selection of different drinks. You really have to see it.  First off I thought it was a little expensive.  The hamburger was a little under cooked but even so the taste was eh. I've had much better and I haven't tasted much worse.  They give you a heaping order of fries and they tasted ok but nothing special.  One thing that struck me was how really uninterested their employees seem to be.  Most places are making a better effort of greeting you, asking you how things are, and saying goodbye. There is obviously no training or effort to great customers or treat them friendly in any way.  My kids had a blast and they loved it but we won't be going back.

I had a little business meeting there today and I'm not a coffee drinker so Don said he would fix me up something. He was going to make me an Arnold Palmer. Oh No! I've only had one Arnold Palmer before and it was nasty.  That's where you mix iced tea with Lemonade.  Well I was going to be polite to Don and drink this down weather I liked it or not. It was delicious. I'm going back Saturday for a refill.  They have a lot of good stuff there I have yet to try, such as bagels and danishes and other sweet coffee drinks I would probably like if I'd try.  Thanks Don and good luck with the Coffee House

I went there for the 2nd time last week and the food was real good.  Mostly I'm impressed with the service.  The first time we went there our waitress thanked us and shook our hand.  I appreciate when someone makes an effort that goes beyond the norm.  The second waitress was really good as well. This is a well run company.  I hope they do very well.

I'm pissed! We went to Firehouse today and the food and service was find but I came out and my truck was towed because I parked in the only available spot next to Jack in the Box.  I went back into Firehouse and I asked "Do people get towed" They answered "oh yes all the time"  Then I asked, "Why don't you tell your customers to help them avoid getting towed?" They said "well there are signs everywhere."  Do you really think anyone would risk eating their again after getting towed and they don't even extend the courtesy of warning you about the parking.  Stupid irresponsible business practices. Obviously they don't care about their customers.
