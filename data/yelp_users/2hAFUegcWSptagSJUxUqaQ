Shane decided to surprise me and made reservations for Coup Des Tartes for our Valentines Day dinner.  This venue is very charming and romantic.  It is always nice to get a little dressed up to eat some AWESOME food.  Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable.  She let us know that all of their foods are grown locally and organically.  I am a huge fan of supporting local organically grown producers.  I got a real at home vibe and could tell that they have a lot of regulars.  We both ordered cheese appetizers, which we could have had one and shared.  I had the Brie spread which was very soft and flavorful, especially matched with the pears.  Shane decided to try the  sampler of different cheese and for the most part was equally as good as the Brie plate.  I decided on the salmon with butternut squash and pumpkin seed risotto.  This was hands down the best match in flavors.  The salmon was very mild in flavor; however, mixed with a little risotto was very warm and flavorful, this dish would be a fall classic.  Shane decided on the fillet which looked great and was gone in 60 seconds.  This venue would be great to take a date or bring good friends to share a bottle of wine.  BTW you can bring your own wine with you and they only charge you a small corking fee.

So I am pretty new to Phoenix, AZ and have had the most horrible time trying to find a decent hair dresser... I was pretty skeptical in trying out a new person, I mean how hard is it to cut an A-line and color a persons hair chocolate brown?  I decided to do some true research and of course used yelp to find Salon Surreal and booked an appointment with Julie.  Their prices are very reasonable cut, color, and style for 100 bucks.  Julie is amazing young and gets the concept of good hair.  Im a talker and for not knowing me at all she really made me feel conformable and I am definitely going back!

This place was AWESOME!!!!  A friend of mine noticed I had a big slash in my tire which of course is not safe to drive with.  My boyfriend and i located the nearest Discount Tire and were relieved to see that they were open for another hour.    As soon as we stepped out of the car we were greeted and taken care of within minutes.  We walked away buying 4 brand new tires for about 500.00. with warranty.  Everyone we worked with was friendly and really helped us out.  I would definitely go back to this location in the future:)

I went here the other night with the roommate to eat some serious sushi. We arrived at about 8:00 p.m. and were instantly greeted at the door and quickly seated.  The restaurant is small and intimate and they have a sushi bar that you can chill at.  There were sushi specials where Nigiri were only a couple dollars and special sushi rolls that priced around 3 to 4 dollars apiece.  We ate 3 pieces of Nigiri and 3 other sushi rolls. Our total bill was about $25.00.  I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in the North West Phoenix area.

For being one of the only decent restaurants in the area I really enjoy L&L. Everyone is always so nice and the restaurant is always clean. I am able to call in and pick up my order as well. The man and I usually stick to what we know; Hawaiian BBQ Chicken and Chicken Katsu all rice no mac salad. I have actually had their mac salad and it basically tasted like mayonnaise which I am not a big fan of.  If you are looking for decent affordable Hawaiian food this place isn't bad.

OMG this place was soooooo good and I can't wait to go back for more. My boyfriend and I were headed out to Tempe a couple days ago and I asked him to Yelp some restaurants in the area. He mentioned pastys and all I could think of was pasties that women wear, anyways, I figured that if Yelpers gave it a great review it must be good. As you walk in it is kind of small, yet intimate. Are SUPER tiny waitress came over to take our order (She was super cute and small). My man ordered Cajun Chicken and I ordered the porky pasty with a Boddingtons. MMMM the food came out nice and warm.  I have to be honest that I liked the mans more than mine, his dish was a little spicy and it came with this chipotle style spread that pulled all the flavors together. The porky was good, it reminded me of pub food I have had in Edinburg, Scotland. It was gravy filled with lots of potatoes and meat.  Needless to say, I felt like I needed a nap afterwards; however, we decided to share the PB&J desert and it was GREAT!  Hands down the warmest best PB&J I have ever had.  We ended up paying around $30.00 for 2 bears dinner and desert, not bad.

I suggested to the man that we go out to WCG as I had been there once before.  Shane made a reservation for 9:00 pm which was convenient as we are late eaters from time to time.  We were greeted and seated very quickly.  The atmosphere is very dark and intimate, very nice for any couple or date.  Our waitress greeted us with a smile and was very knowledgeable of the menu.  I have to say that this place serves one of the BEST Pork Tenderloins I have ever eaten.  The meat is so tender you could cut it with a fork and it came with a very complimentary apricot glaze and mashed potatoes.  Shane had a stake and a few mohitos and I had a pomegranate martini both were equally fantastic.  In all we both had our entrees, an appetizer, desert, and 4 drinks for under $100.00.

BOO!!!! If i had the opportunity to give this place a HUGE ZERO I would.  This place is not only disgusting it hires the stupidest people to work their front register. I figured 4 stars from Yelp this place cant be bad.  As Shane does not eat beans he simply ordered a steak burrito with NO beans, he even asked the chick at the front counter if it had beans inside and she said no.  Why did we end up with a soggy chimichanga and a bean burrito when we got all the way home?  Their salsa taste processed like pace or cheap. The soggy chimichanga was wet and not flavor full.  The man was not able to eat anything as his whole order was messed up resulting in all beans.  I was able to salvage the chicken from the soggy chimichanga and fed it too the dogs.  At least they did not go hungry.

Every time I pop into this BevMo location, I always get what I need for a decent price.  I tend to visit this BevMo location once or twice a month.  The staff is extremely available, knowledgeable, and approachable.  If they are out of what I am looking for they always have a great suggestion for something new to try and everything is always priced reasonable.

This place was highly suggested; however, when Shane and I showed up the only thing that looked good about this place was an oceanic painting on the wall.  I give this place a one star because the food was hot and ready in like 5 minutes, but the appearance was interesting.  I ordered orange chicken; you can't really mess up orange chicken rite?  Well the supposed fried rice was just white rice drenched in soy sauce and the noodles looked old and gross.  The orange chicken tasted nothing like orange and it looked like it was previously frozen.  Sorry peeps I will not be going back to the Golden China.  PS not sure why they are called "Golden" China as there was nothing golden about this place.

I love Fresh and Easy, the man and I come here for pizza essentials, like fresh made pizza dough, fresh goat cheese, and tomatoes.  The staff is very friendly and eager to help.  I find it very convenient that  there is self checkout and their prices are very reasonable.

So I have gone into this CVS location to fill my prescriptions a few times.  Every time I walk in I am rudely greeted by this older woman with short brown hair who is probably 60 but dresses like she wants to be in her 30's.  I walk in to drop off my scrips and of course no hello ever its just a big sigh and "ARE YOU WAITING TO GET THESE NOW?" I let her know that I would like to wait and she sighed again and rolled her eyes.  If you want rude service without a smile when you are trying to simply fill your scrips go here otherwise stick to your local Walgreens.
