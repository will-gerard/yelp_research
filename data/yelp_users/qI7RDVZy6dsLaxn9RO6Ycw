Service was horrible and place was understaffed for a large group even though place was empty. Pizza quality is only reason for two stars. We won't be back.

We love Rudys on Ellsworth and Baseline so we thought we would try the new place. It did not disappoint,the food was great and atmosphere was inviting. We will definitely be back.
