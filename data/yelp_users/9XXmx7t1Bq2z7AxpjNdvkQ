What happened to the friendly service and awesome margaritas?!?!!!  I will never go back after arriving at 8:30 p.m. and having the server dragging the trash can out the front  door and stack chairs on the tables and  at 8:45.  Come on! Really!?! The margaritas that were once so wonderful were horrible!  The manager used to come by the table to do a quality check...not this night... he didn't even glance our way even though the place was empty.  Shame on you for making us feel uncomfortable and rushed.

I love Food City in Surprise!  You can not beat the prices of the fresh produce offered.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I like the deli guy super nice!  Delicious smoked green hatch chiles everyday at no extra cost!  Parking lot is dirty and strange, I try to bee-line it in the store.

My daughter's Dad took her to Kidz R Kool for her first checkup approximately three weeks ago, she is two and a half.  He is still talking about the experience.  He raved about the staff and how pleasant and professional they are.  He said the Dentist was top notch!  :)

Surprise never Surprises me when it comes to a nice dining experience.  It is consistently below average.  It took a long time to be greeted at the table. The lady server was unpleasant and gruff  but seemed to take on a more pleasant attitude later on.  We were served our dinner and did not see her for awhile and then she presented the bill when I was still eating my dinner. "NO RUSH!" is what she said as I had my fork to my mouth. Ugh. Fortunately for the business I did notice a young man serving tables near us and his demeanor was awesome and accommodating to the patrons he was serving.  I was envious and would have paid double to be waited on by him.  We rarely have time to eat out, so this is a place we will not be revisiting.
