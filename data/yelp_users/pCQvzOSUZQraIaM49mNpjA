Way too much fun! We came here for a bite during bike week! Not only do they have a great selection of draft Az beers, but the burgers are awesome. I had a blue with bacon and sweet potatoe fries, my hubby had another burger with garlic fries. They had live music playing on the patio and its just a fun place to grab a bite and an ice cold draft! Live well, eat well and enjoy!

Do you want authentic greek fresh food? Or how about a perfect all beef hot dog, no maybe a grilled cheeseburger! You can have it all...  Here! I love this place! Yesterday our group ordered the gyro plate which was amazingly spiced super moist meat with a traditional style tazzici (sp)sauce. Today cheese burgers! Yum! Fantastic perfectly seasoned fries or a delicious greek salad! Any way you go, you won't be disappointed! Eat well, live well and enjoy!

Seriously, this food was delivered hot, fresh and tasty to our hotel! The House lo mein is delicious, plenty of tender beef, chicken and shrimp! The Orange chicken is round balls of fluffy fried goodness packed with insane orange flavor and a little orange zest to brighten it up!  The crab puffs are sweet and amazing! And all 3 dishes only 27.00 with delivery fee! What! Oh yeah I said it! And the delivery guy was prompt and friendly! I don't know anything about the actual building it came from, but for fast, fresh, delicious delivery, this is a must try! Eat and live well! Enjoy!

This is not the Sizzler you remember from childhood! The food is tasteless the shrimp are over cooked nd mine smelled suspect so I didn't eat it. Early dinner was 23.00 which is grossly overpriced for a tiny steak which was cooked beyond the medium rare i ordered. In fact the only thing edible in my opinion was the salad bar, sweet rolls and steamed veggies. So for 23.00, I would skip this place! Eat well and be happy!

If you are in Vegas, get buzzed into this place! Lindsey, your most awesome bartender will serve you up the best dang bloody mary u have ever put your lips on! Play some pool. Listen to some great music, and on Thursday niggts, sing some kareoke! This is a great hole in the wall bar to get off the strip and just chill in! Have fun all, and tip that bar tender... They work hard for their money!

Uggh. Second go around, graduation weekend, omg, what happened? Filthy room, noise is off the chart. 3:00 am and still they are partying! Really? Every morning I awake to a room and an entire floor that smells like a giant sewer back up... And another week of plastic eggs. Uggh I'm in hell and none of the staff seem to see it. Seriously, my couch looks like biological warfare has happened on it, shower is cracked and dirty. Had to order new pillow cases ( u dont even want to know)! If you stay here, stay off the 2nd floor. ;( sad face

Holy wow. Choices galore! We had catfish which was perfectly fried in a super light batter and absolutely fresh! Talapia was ok, a little dry. The crawfish were New Orleans style and perfectly seasoned. The calamari to die for! If you go you must have the cheesy grits with corn and andouille sausage! We also tried the gator, a bit on the hot side but absolutely perfection and the wedge salad was crisp, cool and loaded with bacon and blue cheese bits! All in all not a thing wrong with the food and portions are substantial! The only reason they don't score a 5 is our server, served our drinks with his fingers placed firmly around the rim of our drinking glasses and my first jameson nd tonic was served in a dirty glass (yuck). A little work on serving etiquette and this is a 5 star easy! Eat well, live well! Enjoy

This place is super fresh and priced just right! Lunch specials from 6.95 - 9.95! And every one worth the price charged. The place is packed at lunch so you should go only if you have an hour, otherwise I would suggest dinner or after work for happy hour! I recommend the sushi lunch special which is fresh and has a nice sampling of sushi with a wonderfully unique spicy salmon hand roll. Or the sashimi lunch special if you're avoiding the rice! If you're not into Sushi they serve a great teriyaki chicken special with a California roll, soup and a huge salad for only 6.95! All in all this is a great stop when you're craving fresh sushi at a great price! We will definitely return! Eat well, live well and enjoy!

Holy Pizza Freshness! This restaurant is spot on! We had amazing fresh hand made wild mushroom pepporoni sun dried tomatoe pizza with the freshest marinara sauce i have ever tasted in a restaurant! The Caprisse salad had tangerines in it and generous portions of tomatoe and fresh basil, in a delicious balsamic vinaigrette dressing with the creamiest goat cheese that literally blended/melted into the salad! Perfection! The drinks were great, wide choice of specialty drinks and craft beers! The service was impeccable! And the topper of the whole experience,,,,, 5 of us ate till we were full, enjoyed an average of 2 drinks each and took our friend a salad to go.... $72.17 total including a generous tip! Go, eat fresh, enjoy and be happy

Fresh, fast, amazing owners! We came here for lunch, 4 of us! We tried the cevechi tostada, amazing packed with shrimp, lemon and cilantro. The carne asada tacos, perfectly seasoned tender grilled meat! The pastor torta, mouth watering marinated pork with cilantro, avocado, and the most delicious, fresh, soft, perfectly toasted bread! The ice cream, omg, seriously... And to top it off, they make their own agua fresita (sp), ( watermelon and 2 other flavors) and homemade horchata! You heard me... The best ever fresh horchata, the way your nana used to make it! This place is a must visit, eat and be happy! Eat and live well! Enjoy

Nice rooms but rather small for a week stay. Very quiet though so great for business stays. I blue lighted my room and they are super clean including the linens. The staff are not as friendly as other hotels I've been at by any means, but they're none the less efficient. The breakfast Buffett is great, lots of choices and healthier than most. All in all a pleasant hotel to stay at.
