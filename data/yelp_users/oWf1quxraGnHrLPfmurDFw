Came in to the store and no one greeted me even though there were 5 employees on at 8 am. Ordered a venti iced coffee with 2 pumps white mocha instead of the regular pumps of classic and they charged me for a full set of pumps (.60) when I asked why I was being charged, very coldly and dignified, the barista told me it is corporate policy... I responded with I know corporate, I was a partner for 6 years. Personally, I would never have charged for the white mocha seeing that I was not getting the full pumps and I was not getting the classic syrup. Never coming to this one again. I much prefer the stores closer to my house. At my store we made sure to greet every guest when they came in and tried to make a connection with everyone who ordered a drink. If this is the same regional manager as other Starbucks I've been to then they need to know he is not doing a good job. A lot of stores are not gold standard.

Had the chicken teriyaki and after a few bites, I was pretty sure it was the pigeons from out side. Lol jk but it was pretty bad. Do not Recommend!

Oh Lux, my biggest enemy. Every time I go I cannot help but get 1 or 2 of their delicious pastries. How can one place be so delicious?!? Oh man and there Jalepeno Bacon Mac n Cheese is insanely good! One of the best places in Phoenix in my opinion

This place can do no wrong. Everything I've ever eaten here has been amazing! Not only that they have great servers and carry Lemoncello!

This is absolutely my favorite Starbucks since loving to phoenix. The staff is friendly and take the time to get to know you. This is where the regional manager needs to see what's going on right and implement into his other stores! I recently moved to 44 Monroe and I still make the longer trip to this store! Jeep up the great work guys. I truly appreciate the great customer service!

I love coming to this store. I've been a frequent visitor since I moved here 2 years ago and many of the Microsoft Store employees know me. I've always had great treatment and they have always been extremely helpful. During the Xbox One launch they made sure to have a day one edition reserved for me and helped me deal with the mistake that happened with the online store. Great location and great people

Friendly service and delicious food. I always enjoy the ambiance at this restaurant and I have always had friendly service. My favorite thing to get here is the jambalaya but you cant go wrong everything is delicious!

The manager, or owner, of this establishment is horrible. Constantly closes earlier than advertised store hours and will sit and watch while you eat if he is ready to go. I mean within the 12 minutes of him closing at 2! 10 people tried to come in and he just ignored them. I mean seriously. Its Saturday and you close at 2! I don't get his business sense he is still paying the rent for the rest of the day, and I'm sure the people who were ignored will not be coming back and neither will I. I like corner bakery as a brand, but I hope this one goes under!

I went to the kiosk and ordered their large Caramel Hazelnut Iced coffee and it was delicious. Not only that, the employee was extremely friendly and attentive. Will come back and try the food!

For being a restaurant in a hotel, this place is amazing. I always have great service and the food is always great. I love going for taco Tuesday and taking guests that are just visiting. If this is your first time here try the Guacamole! I have never had such a delicious Guacamole from a restaurant!

Came in on a Monday and it was pretty busy. I look young and the waitress treated me like a kid who wouldn't tip... Spent 80$ that night on me and my date and the service was crap. Will not come back! I still left a 16$ tip but the waitress was horrible. Please work on your customer service... Then maybe I will come back. The lady waitress on Monday 7/15 @8 pm was horrible. Un-tentative and presumptuous towards the guest! I was a server And know good service. This was not good service

I came in a few weeks ago during the weekend. They seemed pretty slow but it still took the waitress about 10 minutes to come greet us. I ordered one of the Sangrias which was mediocre at best and after another 10 minutes of waiting we ordered our meal. I got one of the hamburgers which tasted very plain. It was nothing special and the place is truly over priced for what they are offering. I would recommend to try the Arrogant butcher downstairs if you want to have better service.

I've been here multiple times and I have never been anything but impressed with service and staff. I've tried so many of their entrees and they all have been great. A few of my favorites are the Rice Bowl and Phoenix Burger.  I have friends who visit and the first thing we do is go get them a burger.

This place is great because of location in my opinion but for the prices they ask I really don't know if it is worth while. My lease is up in a few months and I would like to stay but only if I get a fair price for my place. They tried to hike up my rent for a renewal after I found out someone with the exact same unit is paying 300 dollars less than me! The only way I would stay is if they gave me a fair price.  As for the complex. The tiles in the kitchen break, the cabinets are cheap, the appliances are dated, and the dish washer does not work well. For the same price they are asking you can find something better. One of the worst drawbacks is that every entrance smells like dog urine and there is always something broken. You can expect that once a week you will get an email saying that a certain door is broken or the elevator is not working...  Wrap up- the place is falling apart and for the same price you can find something a lot nicer.

I've eaten here a few times and every time service has been pretty good. Sometimes it feels like you are at someone's home BC I'm sure the staff is family, which can get awkward but food has been amazing! Haven't really enjoyed any of their specialty cocktails so I hope they fine tune their offerings on that end. If you are looking for a good pizza I would definitely come here, as long as you aren't looking to drink.

This place is amazing. From the minute w e walked in we were greeted and asked for how many. There was a wait seeing that it was Sunday brunch, which is very popular here, so we decided to eat at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and we ordered the horchata drink. Totally butchered that! It was delicious. Our food did take a little longer than normal so the manager took off an appetizer without us saying a word. Food is amazing, service is phenomenal, will always recommended and come back!

I love going to this place, even though I don't go as often as I should. The staff has always been extremely friendly and it was only a few visits before they new me by name. To all the people talking shit.. if you don't like it, don't go but if you just want to complain for the sake of complaining then boo you. Honestly, I like the shakes and teas and I love getting my body fat measured. If you have the time stop by and give it a try!

I'm only giving 4 stars because of their confusing hours. I never know when they are open because the hours are constantly changing.  I didn't expect to like this place as much as I did but the burgers are great. I ordered a hot mess burger and it was really good. I wish they would have asked how I wanted it cooked, or better yet I wish I would have told them how I wanted it cooked but none the less it was great.

I want to love this place because its so close to home but unfortunately the burgers are very disappointing. You would think this place had the best tasting burgers for what they are charging but they fall short every time. Service is ok and atmosphere is nice but as far as food and drink's go, its average if not below.

I've given this place 3 tries but it keeps falling short. Last time I went I ordered something off the menu priced at 9.50 but they charged me 15.50 when I asked why, they said they had new dinner prices but they did not have those reflected on the menu yet. Very disappointing, don't think I will visit again.  Update. Originally gave 2 stars but downgraded to 1 after waiting over 25 minutes for my order.
