i`ve had a bad haircut before but not like this. its not even fixable. not that i would set foot in the door again anyway. no idea what the womans name is that cut my hair but you could tell i was bothering her  by asking for a haircut. never said a word, never bothered to ask if it was an ok haircut etc..now i get to look like an idiot til this crap grows out. thanks lady.

i am a pig. i tried everything they offered and i liked every bit of it. the tikki masala was my favorite but i truly enjoyed everything i ate. i think i spent 12 dollars for lunch total. i left a 20 because i ate so much. cant wait to go back!

I`ve had just about everything on the menu and have loved it all. This week I`m strung out on the pork chops. We had Jim and Joanne cater our company christmas party and it was so awesome i decided to do the same for my family christmas get together. It may have been the first year there weren`t any left overs. I highly recommend this place. Great people, great food!
