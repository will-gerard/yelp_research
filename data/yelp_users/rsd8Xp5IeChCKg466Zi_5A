Went here thinking we could get cheap yummy mexican. The only thing that was cheap was the quality of the food. Same prices as the other Mexican restaurants I like much better. Drive to Ajo Als,or El Encanto instead.

No longer Bicycle Showcase is now Bicycles of Scottsdale. A little bit of a remodel but still a very good shop! Great staff!

Love this place I have been coming here for years and the food has always been fantastic!!  It is small and kinda tucked away in the Scottsdale Civic Center next to a wig shop and The Jewel of the Crown Indian cuisine. They do get crowded for breakfast, and lunch as any good restaurant does.They have great coffee drinks, cocktails, and craft beers. Personal Favs: green chili cheddar burger nom nom nom, garlic mushroom omelet, and the prosciutto melt. Salivating just thinking about it!

Awesome and right around the corner! Beach burger is so good! And they have sweet potatoe tater tots! Also they always have amazing looking specials they post on face book. Have yet to try..but they always make me salivate! Craving a good cheap quick burger its your place! Not coporate chain = good food & good service!  Definitely recommend!
