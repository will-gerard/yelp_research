My boyfriend and I had a fantastic time up in the sky!! It was my Xmas present and it was so much fun! I thought I was going to be scared to death being lifted off the ground at 100 miles an hour and floating into things.  That totally did not happen. The balloon slowly lifted up and off we went! The landing was also smooth with no complications, although we were forewarn that it could be bumpy if the wind picked up.  It was light and felt like I was on cloud 9 admiring the scenic beauty of our city and desert. Shane was extremely funny and my boyfriend got a kick out of his humor.  I read a few of the negative reviews on here, and I'd just like to say, 8 passengers is not overcrowded at all for the smaller basket. Each pocket can easily fit two people that totaled 600lbs from my speculation. My boyfriend and I totaled 370lbs and had plenty of room to move around. So unless you are super obese, I don't see an issue.   I would highly recommend them for an experience well done! Thanks!!

My fianc√© and I ate here today!!! It was delicious and reminded me of tacos from Tucson where you could go anywhere to find them. I was disappointed to move up here and find no real good taco shops. But then I ate here and I'm so happy to find my new taco spot! I love the guacamole sauce and the carne asada is so freaken good!!!!! I highly recommend trying it out, you won't be disappointed!  Also for those of you complaining about the size of the menu, sometimes simplicity tastes better. This place doesn't need all the extra things on the menu because it doesn't need it. Plus it's not some fancy restaurant that needs to cater to your needs.

We were excited to get some wings and pizza from this place because we heard it was really good. I have a hard time writing bad reviews about restaurants only because I grew up in one, and sometimes we weren't prefect. But I felt the need to write something about my delivery experience here. I'm okay with waiting up to an hour for delivery. But almost two? That's ridiculous. On top of that we live down the street from this place so I would have expected it to be tops 50 minutes. Maybe I am to blame for not picking up the pizza myself but I paid for the delivery charges and tipped as well so I figured I should have at least had decent service. When we got finally got the wings and pizza it was COLD!!!!!!!! That's the worst. I think that this place has a lot of potential to be great. We ate the pizza and wings and thought it was good for being cold. But again I'd like to emphasize I didn't order COLD food. I hope that maybe they take what I've written here into account about their delivery service. I'd like to try them again but at $40 bucks for a large pie and some wings, it's an expensive trial run.
