I have been Valle Luna in the past and was not very happy with the food and service.  I said I would never go back yet, I decided to give it another try this time when I had friends in town. Once again completely disappointed with the food and service.  I had called ahead to make reservations for a party of 6 and was told they only accept reservations for 8 or more. Okay, I let that one go. We get to Valle Luna the waiting area is not busy at all. I place my name and party size with the host. He did not give me a wait time, just says," okay, have a seat." We waited 30 minutes before I finally had to approach the young man to ask how much longer. He said, "we are still waiting for tables to clear." We wait another 5 minutes then  finally are taken back to our table. First we are seated next to a table with a family with 4 kids, all of which were behaving badly running around screaming, no one said a word to the parents or kids.  Our waitress, Krystle promptly comes to our table to take our drink orders. This is when her poor waiting skills come into play. Krystle never approached us with a smile, a hello, welcome, just a "what would everyone like to drink." She returns with our drink then asks if everyone is ready to order. We all order. I personally had the spinach enchiladas. They were not good to say the least. The description mentions the enchiladas being filled with spinach, tomatoes, potato and zucchini in a blend of cheeses. These enchiladas should have been called cheese enchiladas, that is what they mostly consisted of. I saw the finely chopped pieces of spinach amongst the cheese sauce. However, I never once tasted or saw a potato, tomato or zucchini at any time while eating this dish. It was very bland and again I felt as if I was eating a tortilla filled with Velveeta cheese sauce. My husband and friends were not entirely pleased with their meals either. They all said that the food was okay but too pricey for the quality.  Back to our waitress, Krystle. The worst waitress I have ever encountered while dining out. She could have been more pleasant, and attentive. We had to flag her down on more than one occasion for drink refills, extra salsa, etc. Each time we asked her for something she acted as if we were inconveniencing her. We didn't receive even a thank you from Krystle at the end of our meal. I will NEVER go back to Valle Luna and will not recommend to anyone.

I shop at this location often because its so close to my home.  The majority of the time they have the products that I use in stock.  The downfall to this particular store is the lack of customer service. I don't typically need assistance on the sales floor since I know what I need. However if I did need help there would not be a soul around to assist me. I don't ever see any staff around except at checkout. When I get to the checkout counter the staff is not personable at all. I don't need a full blown conversation to occur but I would think a "How are you?", would suffice.  Instead of talking to a coworker or the typical "Do you have an Ulta card?", etc. You know the questions they are trained to ask . I would appreciate a thank you after my purchase.  Again I will continue to use this Ulta but only because it so close to home. If the customer service does not improve I will have a chat with a manager.

I came to this shop because Discount Tire broke a stud while changing my tire. Discount pays for this repair only through Network. This will be the only reason I ever come back to this shop. I have been here in the past for repairs. Customer service is terrible and front desk is very unorganized. The first two repairs I had at this shop were fine. I came back for a air conditioning problem. Network told me that I needed a new air compressor at $1500. I didn't have the money at the time and chose to hold off on the repair. I ended up going to another shop for a second opinion and estimate. The other shop found the compressor was perfectly fine it was a bad seal on the compressor. I paid under a $100 for part and labor, I also was taken into the bay, shown and explained the problem. Network is a joke and embarrassment to the honest automotive shops.

Flancer's has some amazing food! I have always had the Chile Verde Birdie with fries. This sandwich is so delicious!! They use freshly carved turkey and the green chili mayo has the right amount of kick. The French fries are the best I have had anywhere. The fries are crisp yet tender inside.  My husband always gets the Prickly Pear Chicken Sandwich and raves about it every time.  If the restaurant is busy it is extremely loud and very hard to have a conversation with the person(s) you are having a meal with. I would recommend trying to visit during the slow hours.

I'm so happy to have found Whitey's. All of the staff is knowledgeable and extremely honest.  I do not live near the shop but I will always take my vehicle to them.

Great selection of beers, something for everyone. My favorite is the Kilt Lifter. Beautiful patio area and inside you feel like you are part of the brewery. At times you can see them crafting the fine beers. Four Peaks also offers great food too.

Great food, service, and atmosphere. They have the best margaritas in town. I am a regular at this particular location and I always leave extremely satisfied. They also have great happy hour specials and on the weekend they offer brunch. When the weather is cooler the patio is the place to be.

I use this location since it is so close to work. However,  I will no longer be using this location any longer. I have given the store many chances to make up for slow service.  I typically use the drive thru. I always have a long wait, Friday was the last time I was there and I waited for 10 minutes. I will use the coffee shop across the street (Dunkin Donuts) for now on. The coffee is just as good and they are extremely fast.

I went to this shop to get fresh squeezed juice. I reviewed the website before visiting and found that they had many fresh juice options. However, when I got to the shop all they offered was carrot, apple or orange juice. They did not offer any othet combinations of fruits and vegetables. The associate told me that they no longer offer the other varieties because they found it to be a loss of money because nobody ever purchased the juices and the fruit and vegatables were going bad too quickly. To say the least I was very disappointed and tried the Soy Sensation instead. I was not overly excited about this smoothie. I will not return to this shop unless they decide to add more juices to the menu. I would recommend updating the website and possibly changing the name since juices are not a top priority. Huge let down.

All Pro does provide a free diagnostic and quote. Which includes the mechanic taking the transmission apart. However, the year warranty the shop provides with the repair is worthless. My check engine light immediately came on after leaving the shop. I took my truck back immediately. I was given a ridiculous excuse and I believe they reset the code. The light came back on the next day and they ran the codes again. I was told the codes were for the knock sensor and O2 sensor. I was told to go to another shop for those repairs. Long story short this shop I was referred to wanted to charge me $1500 to repair the sensors. I didn't pay it. I got another opinion and the second shop found that the electrical lines running along side the transmission appeared to be pinched between some metal. They believed that was the culprit and the sensors did not need replacing. I went back to All Pro as suggested by the second shop and was given excuses and they failed to look at my truck again to resolve the issue. I paid $2500 to have my transmission replaced with All Pro, I thought I could trust them. I was wrong.

I tried this restaurant for Arizona Restaurant Week. I really like this restaurant. The atmosphere is awesome, small, nice decor, nice music, and great customer service. Fuego Tacos has a great bar that offers an array of drinks, the food is superb.   The offer for Restaurant Week was a three course meal with a glass of sangria. My husband and I loved our meal. We started with the taco salad, made with fresh ingredients and extremely flavorful. The chipotle dressing was the perfect amount of heat, we chose to have the salad made with the Pernil Asado. A perfect choice, heavenly!  For the main course I had the Pernil Asado tacos. I LOVE this meat, so tender and has outstanding flavor. My husband had the Barbacoa tacos and we were not as impressed with this particular meat choice.  The dessert was churros with ancho fudge sauce. I was not at all impressed with this dessert. The fudge sauce lacked ancho chile flavor, which was a complete disappointment. I would have preferred some heat.  Overall, I loved the restaurant, the food and the customer service.  I will definitely go back again.

The subs are fantastic and fresh. Great shop and great customer service. My husband and I go all the time. We are life long customers.  My favorite is the Torpedo and my husbands favorite is the Smokey Southwest. Mmmmm...delicious!!!  I would strongly recommend trying Planet Sub for yourself.

I have been here twice once for breakfast and once for lunch.The service was great my first visit and awful my second. Both visits offered terrible food and was overpriced. I had hoped for a better experience the second time around. I will never return.

I finally decided to stop in to the shop to try some cupcakes, after driving by many times.   I tried two cupcakes: Caramel Apple & Raspberry Lemon.  I found both of these flavors to be heavenly! As I write this I am craving more!  The Raspberry Lemon consisted of lemon cake filled with lemon zest, it was light, moist and had perfect lemon flavor. The raspberry buttercream frosting was amazing. So fruity and had bits of raspberry. The Caramel Apple consisted of apple spice cake with a streusel bottom with tasty buttercream frosting topped with a caramel drizzle and a streusel crumble.  The day I went in the shop did not have any of the flavors that I wanted to try that I had seen on the shops website. I opted for the above flavors and I was not disappointed. The staff said that they always have the three popular flavors on hand (Red Velvet, Triple Chocolate, Oreo) and the other cupcake flavors change daily. That being said if there is a particular cupcake flavor you would like to try you might want to call ahead.   I was greeted when I came in to the shop. However, it did seem a bit strange having three employees staring at me as I tried to decide which cupcakes I wanted to purchase. Each employee asked me random questions, such as, "What are you up to today?" When I replied with not much, the employee replied, "really nothing?!", then the other laughed and said, "eating cupcakes?!" Then as I made my decision on the cupcake flavors which was two, the employee said, "Only two?!? That in particular made me uncomfortable.  I really loved the cupcakes I purchased and I will return to try others. However, if I come across conversation like I experienced with the employees again I will have to say something.

This was my first visit to this medical office.  I made an appointment for vaccines.  I was told to arrive 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork. As I walked into the office the waiting room is very drab and dirty. They had many papers taped on the doors and walls regarding cell phone use and other notices. I signed in at the front desk. The girl at the desk was not welcoming and never smiled. I arrived 25 minutes early and had printed the forms off of their website and completed prior to the visit. I was still given additional forms to fill out, the front desk receptionist told me not all the forms are available on the website. I politely mentioned someone should update the website. I proceeded to fill out the forms. The forms I completed from the website were the typical personal and medical history. However, the additional forms I was asked to complete were a bit strange. The first was a form on varicose and spider veins (family history and symptoms I may be experiencing), the second was a prescription policy stating they will not call in or fax prescription requests to the pharmacy, you must pick up the written request. Lastly, was a doctor-patient arbitration agreement. I have NEVER had to fill out a form like this at any doctors office I have visited. At this point I was questioning this medical practice and their doctors. I found this to be unsettling.  After waiting for 50 minutes in the waiting room. I watched 3 people go into the back office before me and they arrived after me. I was finally called back. I walked through the door to the back office, I was directed to a small corner to have my vitals checked. This was not a closed space or room, I was out in the open, other patients and staff were walking past me. After that I was escorted to a private room. I will say that the  medical assistant was very friendly. Then the doctor came into the room, she never introduced herself. Luckily I knew who I was seeing (Dr. Finley) and she was very nice and answered all of my questions pertaining to the vaccines.  I will not go back to this office and will not recommend it to my friends and family.
