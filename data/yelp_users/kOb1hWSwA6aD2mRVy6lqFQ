This place is ok if you are so starving you don't care what you eat. The chips and salsa are great, but everything else is pretty bland. I am a fan of tamales and I would definitely not order it again. They do make some pretty good chicken tacos, but you only receive 2 small tacos and its about $12... no thanks! I would prefer Taco Bell over Mi Amigos. The staff is very nice and the service is good, too bad the food does not match.

My absolute favorite "chicago" style pizza. The best thin crust pizza....... ever! I love the super crispy edges of this amazing pizza. This place is usually pretty busy and parking well.. sucks. Definitely plan on being here a little longer than most restaurants you visit. We always order the pizza cookie, formerly known as the pizzookie. It is the absolute best thing in the world. Makes even the most horrible restaurant experience ever, into an epic treat! I will be back again and again.

I have just recently discovered Luke's and mmmmmmm I am addicted! The best Italian sandwich EVER!!! I ordered the whole because I was starving, but was defeated halfway. I put the half in the fridge for lunch the next day and it still was amazing! Small menu but it is definitely worth it! ps... fries are really good too! om nom nom nom

After months of listening to a coworker talk about how amazing this pizza was I finally gave in and went for lunch. I had a small pep and cheese, which was the perfect lunch size btw. I have to admit that this crust was nothing short of amazing. They were not shy with the toppings either, which made it even more amazing because cheese makes everything awesome. I even found myself thinking about the crust after I left, and the next day as well. I am not sure what they put in that pizza but I am addicted. It would be dangerous if I lived close.... I will definitely be back.

I followed Tabby here from another salon and will follow her wherever she goes! I get rock star toes and they are amazing. Tabby is a great nail tech and my toes always look fabulous. My toes take a beating from crossfit and the rock stars still look great. The salon is clean and every employee I have ever been in contact with is very nice. I never have any issues with making appointments and I love the text message appointment reminders.    Tabby herself would get 5 stars.

This particular location, which I believe is not owned by the same person as the one on 15th avenue is not my favorite. Stopped in for lunch a few days ago and was reminded why I have stayed away. Their food seems to be packaged and heated up rather than prepared. It is amazing the difference between the two locations. The pita bread is dry and seems like something you would buy at a grocery store. I definitely suggest trying the other location, definitely worth the drive and extra time.

I am a huge fan of the breakfast burritos here. I usually get the egg, bacon, and cheese. I am very picky about my bacon but La Canasta makes it super crispy, which is exactly the way I like it. The best part about this location is that they have a drive-thru. It's an easy way to get some breakfast on the way to work in a hurry.

This is my absolute favorite breakfast place... ever!! The biggest and most amazing chorizo burrito I have ever had! Eggs, chorizo, cheese and hash brown in a huge tortilla. I have never been disappointed with this burrito. I live in Laveen and we drive over on saturday mornings to get this! I also love the burgers as well. I usually order the bacon cheeseburger... I love crispy bacon and that is exactly what you get! They are not cheap with the cheese either! Large portions, I suggest ordering the smaller fries...the small is huge! I love this place!   They do have a huge menu! Something for everyone.....

This is the best fry bread around! Forget that bland attempt you get when the fair comes around, Fry Bread House is the best! Clean, ok customer service, but amazing food! I loooove the tacos here and you can't forget a honey and powder sugar fry bread post taco! yummmmmmmmmmmm .. ps you need lots of napkins.

I could eat this 3 times a week and never get tired of it. The most amazing Chicken Feta Salad... ever!! Large portions and they do not hold back on the feta! The staff is frendly and amazing, the food is great. I love this place! How could I forget the pita bread... mmmmmmmmmm! This location is my favorite, but is pretty small. Go early and be patient. It is definitely worth it!

I have been eating here for years. They really need to remodel this place, but the food is still really good! One of the best tamales and beans around! Service is definitely better for dinner. I go for lunch and they are definitely not fans of splitting the bill for the lunch crowd. Otherwise.. yummmmm!

I have been to this place a few times now and I totally love it. Great food and it has a diner atmosphere. I only came here because of other yelp review and am soooo glad I did! I have had the omlette and French toast and they are both great. The portions seems large, like what you would expect at a family, small-town diner.  It was not that long of a wait even when it was busy, definitely worth it. I will be back again!

I have to admit this place is definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants I have eaten at in a long time. Cheap lunch special, tons of food..... can't get any better than that. I had the sweet and sour chicken and it was soooooo good. I barely put a dent in my plate because there was so much food. Definitely coming back.

Meh!!!  I really wanted to give this place 1 star, but there was something I did like about this restaurant...... the diet coke! lol  I can get over bad service, which we did have, but the food was bleh! Way too spicy and pretty small for the price. I ordered a beef tamale and beans. The tamale was about a third of the size it should be and looked like someone had slapped it on the plate and put hot sauce on top to cover up the job. I am not a fan of whole beans, I like 'em refried. So, after burning my tongue and trying to get full off of the greasy chips I gave up.   We actually had to go and get food somewhere else after we left. We were still hungry because most of our party of 5 did not eat the "food" we were served. I definitely will not be back.   ps... they charge for soda and iced tea refills! I knew when I read that on the menu I was not going to be happy with this place.

I met a friend for an early dinner here on a weekday. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I was disappointed it was a Pepsi place lol, but other than that the food was great. I had lemon chicken and a veggie egg roll and both were exactly what I expected. It was fast, not too expensive ($13 for me), and indefinitely will be back again.

I loooove Kincaid's for lunch!!! They have the best bread to munch on while you wait for your food. I usually have the lunch special of Halibut with just cracked pepper and lemon. Wowomg sooo good. My mouth is watering right now. You can't leave this place without trying the Cremme brulee! It is the best I have ever had. Yummmmmmmmmm!

This is one of the best burgers I have had in a long time! Lenny's is clean, cheap and fast! My food was done before I finished filling up my soda. I went with a party of 5 for lunch and there was no problem finding a seat. If you work downtown, I would definitely stop by for lunch!

Went here on a pretty busy Saturday night and was lucky to get in with a few mins wait. I ordered grilled chicken and I was able to pick two sides. The green beans were amazing! More than amazing, like I can't stop thinking about them and I will go back for just that reason. They were seasoned with pepper and covered in bacon mmmmmmm. Please try them!! You will thank me later.

Came for a 4 year old's birthday party. Handed our present to the employee at the front desk and she put it in the bin for us. Once the presents were opened we noticed 2 were missing. The hosts discovered the mistake and said they were taken home by another child. The host said if we had receipts to give them to the front desk to be reimbursed. The front desk staff said we would not be reimbursed and only offered a free pass. The front desk was not interested in fixing the problem their staff caused.   It is extremely disappointing the front desk staff would not fix this for is. 4 year old children are not able to understand there was a "communication" issue, and that was the explanation we were given by the party hosts.   Save your money, use a different party place. There are more out there, businesses should remember that part.

Brenna contact me about the unfortunate situation that happened at our party. She was very nice and understanding about everything that happened. She purchased the items that were lost and had them shipped directly to the birthday boy. Thank you for contacting me so quickly and fixing this problem for us. We really appreciate it!

Finally stopped for breakfast here after driving by for years. Nice family, diner atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and does a great job getting everyone a table as quickly as possible. I had am omelette with hash browns and it was delish! The best part was the biscuit that came with my breakfast, it was as big as my hand. I can't wait to go back for another. The dessert case is conveniently by the cashier and it all looks amazing. Definitely will be back!

Came in for an early dinner before a movie, and before the rush at approximately 6pm or so. Walked right in a got a table. I ordered the blackened sirloin and it was amazing! So good I have been thinking about it many times since that evening. It had the perfect amount of kick and the herb butter on top just make it that much more amazing. Very friendly and attentive staff, I will definitely be back.

I visited District with a large group of people on a Saturday evening before going to a club downtown. We did not all arrive together, but were there within 15 minutes of each other. We were seated off to the side, out of view from almost the entire restaurant. This was what I believe the problem was for us. It took roughly 30 minutes to get our first round of drinks, and most of the service was pretty slow that evening. However, the Manager did come over and apologize and gave us our first round of drinks on him. I ordered the Cedar Roasted Pacific Salmon with asparagus tip risotto, and it was great. This is definitely a great place to visit if you find yourself downtown for any reason. I do not think I would come downtown specifically to eat here, but it was still a great meal.

I have been to a different location and I remember it being really good. It has been some years though, just to be fair. My tacos were just ok, but it was really expensive for two people to have lunch. The burrito was really small my friend had and we both left hungry $25 later.... no thanks.

I absolutely love this place. I am addicted to wine and this is the perfect place for that. I had the bruschetta and chose the brie and apples with fig. . it was amazing! Perfect combo with the wine the waitress suggested. I was there on a Saturday night, it was pretty packed but definitely worth it. We sat outside, it was chilly but they had heaters out there. After a few sips of the wine I forgot about the cold anyway. I will definitely be back to Postino for more wine and bruschetta! Sooooooo gooooooood.

I went in on a Saturday morning around 9:30 after a 5k run... so I was starving! The food was amazing! I ordered the pancakes... 3 huge pancakes with eggs and hash browns for $5.50. I had my food in about 7 - 10 minutes and was not disappointed! The eggs were cooked perfectly, the pancakes tasted like I made them at home. This is a great place for a good, cheap breakfast if you are in the area. I will definitely be back!!

If you do not like Chipotle, you have some issues. Cheap, fresh and ethical! lol   It is amazing, what else can I say. They can have an off day here and there, but that only shows that it is made fresh and not from a package. Even on a bad day, it is still good. I love you Chipotle!!! om nom nom nom

This is my favorite taco place! I traditionally would always eat these type of tacos in Mexico on the side of the road hoping they were beef! lol... The carne asada tacos are excellent! You actually get all meat, no chewy surprises like at other places. I love them with lots of lime juice on them. I have also tried a carne asada quesadilla and it was great! Definitely stop by if you are in the area. You will love it.

I am soooo addicted to Yogurtland!!! It is $.39 an oz and so good! There are about 16 or so flavors of frozen yogurt that you can mix yourself. They have an amazing toppings bar with everything you can think of! If I lived closer to this place I would probably be there every night. Love it!

The food is pretty good, but the service is ............ very bad. I ran over around 8:00 pm to get a bean and cheese burrito. It took around 30 minutes to get that order. All of the employees working that night appeard to be under 18. There looked to have been some kind of small fire in the kitchen, but they never came out to say what was going on or any kind of updates on the status of the orders. I was not the only person waiting, another customer was there 40 mins +. With the abundance of mexican restaurants in that area, I doubt I will be back.

Another update....  I have been going to Villa's roughly every other weekend for a few months for the Chorizo breakfast burrito. I have to admit that I am addicted and it is to the point where I do not have to order when I get there. They know what I want and get it started as soon as they see me. Glad I gave this place another chance, it was worth it!

I was with the previous reviewer, Jake, so I will not go over the entire story again. Basically as you can see from other reviews they are always late and make promises they can't keep.   When we did finally cancel at about 10:30 am (They were hours late at this time btw) Myron promised to refund us or comp us a trip in the future with a larger group. We were told to call him after the river trip and he would take care of it.  I remembered how hard it was to actually schedule this and get a confirmation from him before, so I mentioned that they never answer the phone. He stated I had the "company cell" number and it was always answered. I called on Monday morning .......... no answer! I was not shocked because at that point I had read the previous reviews and realized that this is their typical way of doing business. Promises that are not kept, and horrible service.   Save your money, find a different company. Nuff said!

The tacos here are amazing!!! I came for a Sunday afternoon brunch and wow it was packed! We were still seated and served fast, and the crowd on the bar side looked like they were having an amazing time. The weather was perfect, friendly staff, amazing tacos... it was a great afternoon. I will definitely be back for those tacos.

Lucky for me I work close to this place because I am addicted! 3 tacos for $7 and they are not small, at least in my opinion. I had the chicken, chorizo, and carne asada.... I thought the chicken and chorizo was amazing! Spicy, but not too spicy, you will know that you are alive. I had some chips as well, they were great and reminded me of the chips from Chipotle that I totally love. This place was cheap, very fast, and sooo good om nom nom nom.

This is usually my default if I need lunch fast in between meetings. I order online and like 10 minutes later it is delivered! Bread is always fresh and delicious and the online system is really easy to use to place your delivery order. For a sandwich, its pretty good and the fact they deliver makes it even better.

Came here for a girls night dinner. Made reservations and arrived early to have a few drinks at the bar. I had the pomegranate martini and it was strong and delish! After our party was seated I ordered the apples and brie with fig bruschetta.. amazing! One of my friends ordered the tempura green beans and they were great! Pizza was great as well as you would expect. Friendly staff and they didn't mind our very extended stay of approx 3 hours of inappropriate girl talk. Definitely will come back!

Went to this location to watch an ASU game and just hang out with some friends. Ordered the blackened chicken flatbread and it was great. Just the right amount of spice so my nose didn't run. My favorite part was watching the more "seasoned" men stare and the waitresses with no shame. I will definitely be back to people watch and have some beers!

Decided to treat myself and have some housekeeping service done for my house. I have a two story home and was not in the mood to do any spring cleaning. I emailed Clean Service Pro and was promptly contacted by Sandra to discuss what I needed and make an appointment. They arrived as scheduled and both went to work immediately. I was impressed with the attention to detail and how clean my house looked after they left. I will definitely use them again!

This is a usual spot for my friends and I to eat on Sunday mornings when we can. I typically order the quick start loaded which is eggs, bacon, potatoes etc... They do have amazing jam that comes with your toast and I am a fan of the raspberry! The food is very fresh and looks amazing. This place gets pretty busy, and in the summer months there is definitely a wait because nobody wants to sit outside. One of my favorite places to nurse a hangover. Yummmmmmmmmy.

If you are looking for a great burger that is not going to bankrupt you, this is the place. I have never had a bad burger here. This place is very clean and the food tastes fresh. There are some good options for healthy eaters such as lettuce "bread" and chicken sandwhiches. Cheap, fast, and tasty.... no complaints here.

Meh.. that about sums up my thoughts on this place.   I am not really a huge fan of sandwich restaurants, so maybe that influences my feelings. It is pretty much another Quiznos ... sandwich, chips, drink... My sandwich was good, but it was not amazing. I prefer Subway honestly. With Chipotle and The Habit right next to it, I probably will not be back.

I am not really a huge fan of fancy pizza, but this pizza was quite delicious. I went for the classic pepperoni and cheese and it was really good. It's a pretty big personal serving of pizza; most likely you will need to take half home. It is on the pricy side, but you can tell the ingredients are fresh and high quality. This restaurant is really cute and right next to a bakery, which is convenient for the sweet tooth after. It was good and I will be back, just not on a regular basis.

Red.Velvet.Cupcake...... AMAZING! One of the best ones I have ever had. It was hard to choose from all the available options, but many people can't master the craft of the red velvet cupcake appropriately. Definitely worth you time to stop and grab some sweets from this place. There is also a bread bakery in the same location and you are visually tempted to buy that with the wonderful display. Great place, will definitely be back.

I am addicted to this pizza! I have never had a problem with takeout or delivery. Each time the pizza was ready as promised, even delivered earlier than quoted. I usually get a regular pep and cheese, but have tried the gluten free as well. Never had a bad pizza or problems with customer service. They are very busy on the weekends, you just need to plan ahead. It is worth the wait.

Stopped in around 5pm for a cupcake on a Saturday. The cashier was not very friendly, and seemed annoyed to have to answer questions. The cupcake was not fresh, tasted like it was at least 3 days old. The gigantic mound of icing on top did not disguise that stale taste either. Won't be back and wouldn't recommend. Booooooo

I waited a bit to write this to give them some time to fix all the problems with opening a new store. The first few times I visited there was excessive waiting. I was there around 8pm and it still took roughly 30 mins to get thru the line with about 20 people. Very excited they have fixed the issue and the last few times I have been were just as quick as any Chipotle I have been to. The food is the quality you would expect at any Chipotle. This is one of my favorite places and I am excited it is down the street from me

Looove fry bread! Om nom nom....  Normally I look forward to state fairs or festival type gatherings to get fry bread, but ever since I had this fry bread there is no need to wait! In fact, the Fry Bread House is much better than any other I have tried, so I skip it unless I am here. I usually get the Indian Taco, which is fry bread with beans, cheese, and lettuce. Big serving..  you will be more than satisfied. Do not forget to try the honey and powder sugar! Amazing and worth the extra calories.

I must admit I am addicted to this pizza. If I lived closer I would have more pizza in my life! Amazing sauce that makes you think about it and want more after you have left. I usually get the small peperoni, which is perfect for one person with enough to take home for later. I have had great service each time I have been here and come by when I am in the neighborhood.

Came here with a group of friends to do some day drinking on Nat'l Margarita day. This was our second stop of many planned on our adventure. I ordered the bulldog margarita expecting something amazing........and was disappointed. The only thing I tasted was beer and margarita mix. There was either a very small amount or no tequila in this drink. This is a very popular drink; I could see it on almost every table that afternoon. I am not sure if I will be back, not a fan of watered down or virgin adult beverages.

I was bummed we had just missed the breakfast, because it looked amazing. So I had low expectations when ordering lunch because I wanted breakfast so badly. I ordered the Carne Asada Street Tacos and wow they were good! I was starving and hungover so I inhaled all 4 in minutes. Although it is Vegas so a little pricy, definitely were delicious and I would go back for more. The patio also provides great people watching entertainment. tart your review...

This is hands down the best fried chicken I have ever had! I am not a fan of eating skin, but wow they make it so good you want to eat every bit of it. The cake donut is amazing as well! I was really impressed how good it was without any icing on it. Of course I have tried several different donuts there and all were absolutely amazing. Go early, be ready for amazing chicken, take extra donuts to go!

I came in for a gel manicure a few days after the grand opening. Although I was late, they still were able to accommodate my appointment. Very friendly staff and electronic check-in system eliminates the previous card system used for the old business' rewards card. There is a huge variety of polish colors to choose from, including gel polish. Everything is clean and new, I will definitely be back for another manicure.
