This place has a great atmosphere. The patio is awesome and they place live music. The food was delicious and they had tons of healthy options. So why not 5 stars? The service was pretty bad. I ordered wine and asked for water with it. Then I asked again, and again. But it never came. I also ordered my meal with no tomatoes and they put them on. My friend ordered her sandwich with no mayo and they put it on too. So just plan to be there a while and don't be too picky and you'll love it!

Stopped by today to buy some rear drums for my car and got excellent service and attention from the manager, Jae. It was a quickie and price was right. He checked if he could turn my rotors for only $13.99 but they were out of spec so I bought new ones and he even gave me a 10% discount. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. I will definitely drive out of my way to go to this location from now on. They rock! :)

I tend to go to nail salons for pedicures all over the valley, and they are all pretty comparable from one place to the next. I haven't found one that I go back to regularly, not because I don't enjoy it. They are all just very similar and nothing stands out about them. That was until I discovered Tiffany's! Tiffany's is a league above! For the basic pedicure, which is $22, you get a very long massage (wish I would've timed it!), nice scrub, hot stones, and hot towels. Everyone was friendly and the chairs were comfortable. I will be back to this one for sure!

My husband and I walked in here to get fitted for a tux. We are in a wedding out of state and just needed measurements. The man was very friendly and got my husband completely measured in 2 mins flat! And for no charge, even though we weren't ordering the tux from them. Score!

I did not get a sandwich from here. I ordered the spicy ramen noodles since it was a chilly, rainy day. I was genuinely shocked on how amazing it was! Not that I didn't think it would be good, but it was seriously some of the best stuff I've ever had. I now crave it at least once a week!   Not only did the amazing soup earn them the 5 stars. The service was awesome. I only ate about half a bowl of soup and asked for a to-go container. The lady came out and separated my noodles from the broth and put them in different containers. She also explained to me how to reheat it properly so it doesn't ruin the flavor. She then taped them tightly shut so it didn't leak in my car.  FYI this is an "order at the counter" type of place. This type of superb service was totally unexpected, but greatly appreciated. I was able to eat the rest of my ramen the next day and it tasted just as fresh and flavorful as when it was first served. This was all thanks to the wonderful service of this sandwich shop.

I purchased a deal chicken deal for 3 oil changes from this place. It came with a coupon card that offered 15% off of a cv boot replacement. Well it just so happened I needed a new cv boot so this was perfect!  I scheduled my cv boot replacement during my 2nd out of 3 oil changes. I specified that I would be on a time restraint and would only have 2 hours for the work to be done. I was assured that would be no problem at all  Well things happen, right? The company that sent the part over sent the wrong part. George said that he would have them bring the right one right away and I would still be out of there in time. Well lucky me, they still didn't bring the right part for the second time. I was pretty upset because I had to drive back to Scottsdale to pick up the little girl from school that is my charge as a nanny. So George offered to let me drive his personal car that happens to have the same size car seat I use installed in it. Since the little one I had to pick up was not my child I was not comfortable doing this. But what I nice gesture!   So I rescheduled the service for the following day and left after two hours of my time wasted for an oil change.   So why the 5 stars? Because George replaced my cv boot for no cost, due to my troubles the prior day. Awesome! Even though this was not his fault, he ate the cost and made the customer happy, hoping I will return. And I will, for sure!

This place is very close to a 5 star for me. At this point I'm going to say it's at a 4.5. The reason being is that my husband and I ate there over the weekend and ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. On the menu it said it had fresh carrots, celery, and onions on it. Sounded fab! But when it can out it was a greasy mess of a pizza. It looked like they threw some chicken and wing sauce on a regular cheese pizza and called it a day. And since the base of most wing sauces is butter it mad the pizza go greasy we could barely eat it.   With that being said, we have eaten hear several other times and always loved it! The antipasto salad is amazing. and the Greek pizza is yummo. Their wings are some of the best I've had, and I don't say that lightly. I LOVE hot wings and am pretty picky about them. Red devil makes them super crispy with lots of sauce. If you get nothing else here, get the hot wings!

I almost wasted $260 on an unneeded tire. I brought in my car to fix a flat, it had a nail in it. After waiting almost an hour they told me it was unrepairable and tried to get me to buy a new tire. They were originally purchased at Fletcher's so I brought it there instead, hoping it was under warrantee. To my surprise they fixed the flat with no problem and I was on my way in 30 minutes, didn't have to spend a penny. Sham on you discount for trying to take advantage of a lady.

Love love love this place! They have the cheapest prices in town for premium dog food. They have great hours, open 7 days a week. The staff is very friendly and always helps me carry my food to the car. They also have a scale in the back and let me weight my great dane pup whenever I come in. Not just the food is cheap though. All of your other pet products are do much cheaper than petsmart or petco. I found a prong collar for $8.99 that was $20 at petsmart. It was the same thing! I feel very lucky to live right down the street from here.

This place is very nice for the area of town. The prices are reasonable. They do a hot stone massage which is awesome! And they use a timer set at 10 mins for the pedi which is nice because you know you won't get shorted. But they also won't go over either which is a bummer. But all in all I was happy with the services I received.

The food was just okay. Super greasy from the lard in the beans and meat was not of good quality. The tortillas they used were very good though. But because if the grease pouring out of my burrito I couldn't eat it.

They have the best salad ever! The name is Thai-High Sweet & Zesty Chicken Salad. It is seriously the best salad I've ever eaten. I crave it daily! And it's huge so if you go there for lunch you can easily split it. They also have a good kids menu and a nice atmosphere. But really, don't miss out on that salad!

This is our favorite park! And I'm guessing we are not the only ones that feel like this because this park can get super packed. Plan to play a buck to ride the train or carousel. And adults have to pay too which is kind of silly. But it is worth it because its a super cute park!

If you don't mind the dent this place will put in your wallet you will love it. This is my go to store if there is a specialty item I can't find at my normal grocery store. I also go on often to pick up breakfast. They have egg and cheese bagels that are premade for $3.50. They are way better than any breakfast sandwich you can get at a fast food restaurant.

This place is by far the most affordable and best place to get a pedicure in Scottsdale! It's only $20 for the basic pedi. That comes with a hot stone massage as well. I love how they heat their lotion so it doesn't freeze you. They are extremely friendly and value their customers. The salon is very clean and the massage chairs are comfy. They also open at 9:30am which is really nice. This is my new favorite discovery!

If you're not in a rush this place is great! I went for breakfast and it was really good. The menu is pretty unique. There are tons of things I still want to try! But it took forever for them to come and take our order. The place wasn't really packed either which was weird. But once the food came it was well worth it. And they were really sweet about taking forever and even gave us some free fruit.

I guess I just didn't get it. I ordered a half sandwich with soup and the tortilla soup was so oily I couldn't eat more than two bites. There were peices of skin from the chicken in the soup which was really gross too. The sandwich was good, but not worth the price of $6.50. They also charge 50 cents per extra item which includes things like olives, pickles, and peperoncinis. Really?!? I can see extra for avocado or bacon, but not the basic veggies. What a rip off. The sandwiches at sprouts are just as tasty and you can get all the veggies you want. They also have a daily special for $2.99 or $3.99 for most other sandwiches. Try that instead!

I purchased a groupon for this car wash and have been here several times. Consensus is they are great. I get in and out quickly, the waiting room is comfortable, and staff is friendly. But most importantly, they do a good job.   One downside, they are very pricey. But they offer coupons all the time so after the discount it's very reasonable.

This place is fabulous! The instructors are wonderful, they have tons of class options, the recitals are very well done and professional, and the new studio is very nice. The address on yelp is their old address. They are now located on Via Linda and Mountain View in the AJ's shopping center. If you sign your child up here you won't regret it!

Yum yum yum! Mexican food has to me my favorite type of food and Arriba is for sure at the top of my list for Mexican restaurants! This is a New Mexican style restaurant with lots of hatch green chilies in their dishes. You can also buy them fresh from here by the pound during the month of August.   I have eaten here probably 30+ times and they are always consistent. The chips are always fresh and warm  they serve two different salsas as well as bean dip. All three are the bomb! My favorite item on the menu is the whitesands chimichanga. Do not order this though if you can't handle spicy stuff. but if you are like me, the spicier the better, then go with this!   Everyday they have good lunch specials. I like to go on Thurs because they have chimis for $1.99. For an extra dollar they will smother it with the white sands sauce. What a deal! And on Sunday they have kids day with a clown that makes animal balloons. And best of all, kids eat free!   And if your a beer drinker they have a microbrewery too. I'm not a beer drinker though so I can't tell you how good it is. But the margaritas are on point!

I have been here several times for an eyebrow wax and have had a great experience. They are very quick, clean and thorough. The prices are reasonable and they also have a punch card! They have been flexible with changing my appointments and squeezing me in last minute a couple of times. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a locally own wax center.

I have been taking my dogs here for over 5 years and have always been pleased. They are affordable and very down to earth. What I love the most about this vet is that they never try to upsell you on things you don't need. They are also open on Sat and Sun which is very convenient.   We recently got a new puppy and discovered Arrow Animal Hospital puppy program. This included all 4 puppy visits with vaccinations and dewormer for around $200 total. You won't find this price anywhere else!

This place is a great neighborhood bar with a separate side for the restaurant. It's also family owned which is always a plus in by book!   I've been here too many times to count and have tried over half of their menu. They have the best wings! I like mine pretty hot and I still go with medium here. Their antipasti salad is a must try, with the house Italian dressing. My least favorite thing on the menu is actually the pizza. It's pretty good, just not one of my favorites. All of their pasta dishes are good and I love their soups.   And for dessert, don't miss the pullokie!!!

I have been going to this family owned business for years and love it! At the deli I always get the Italian stallion which is Delicious. The meat is always very fresh. They also have wise potato chips and Italian ice. Brings me back to my childhood growing up in New Jersey! Every time I stop in I always grab a few jars for their homemade spaghetti sauce. It is amazing and isn't to high in sodium. It's for sure the next best thing to making it yourself. I love the staff here as well. They are very friendly and will take care of you.

This is such a great bakery! I purchased a King's Cake for a Mardi Gras party and it was awesome. They were also able to make the cake for me with less than a 48 hr notice. How amazing is that!?! Take a look at the pic I took of it and posted it to the business site on yelp. It was super cute. And not to mention so tasty.   They also have a great selection of muffins, donuts, and cookies. And don't leave without trying one of their macaroons! They are orgasmic!!! What's not to love about the Baker Wee? I agree, nothing!

Not your basic car wash! They go above and beyond to ensure the customer is satisfied. They are super quick and the waiting area is comfortable. For the services you get it's the best price in the area. They also have a punch card so every 10th wash is free. The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is because this location does not offer oil changes like the others. Kind of a bummer.

My new Tempe addiction! I recently moved less than a mile to this place and have been 4 times. I have tried different sandwiches each time and they are always perfect! So far my favorite is the wake n bake. It has bard boiled eggs on it which add such nice texture and flavor. The staff here is also very friendly and attentive. And who doesn't want a nice glass of kool aid to go with your "blunt"?!!

Walking into this place I immediately knew it was a top notch, 5 star liquor store. They have prices cheaper than grocery stores! For example, 3 olive vodka is only $14.99. They also offer 10% off if you buy 6 or more bottles of wine or liquor, and you can mix and match!   The selection here is seriously amazing. No joke, I've never seen such a selection of both wine, beer and liquor. I saw a bottle of vodka that was shaped like a shotgun, with a strap and all! They also rate their wine like high end wine stores do, which always makes shopping for wine more fun.   Best of all, the employees and customers we all so friendly. I left there with a smile on my face and a couple of bottles of wine to enjoy. I even wrote this review before I opened a bottle. Now THAT is impressive!

I have been come a weekly regular here and haven't been disappointed once. The Pittsburgh wings are seriously amazing! I've also tried many other things on the menu and everything is very tasty. You get chips and salsa once your seated and the salsa is very fresh and authentic. They have an affordable lunch menu with lots of options for around$8. The atmosphere is nice during the day. Very cute decor! By the looks, I'm sure it is pretty cool in the evening too. The service could be a little slow at times during the lunch rush, but due to the food quality they still deserve a big 5 star to me!

The reviews for here are spot on. The food was okay. Yummy margaritas! Okay salsa, but not great. Overcooked chips. But considering we live in Phoenix there is no need to waste your time eating here. There are hundreds of better Mexican food restaurants that you don't have to wait to be seated and way better priced.

I have been here way too many times but I am officially done giving them chances. So frustrating that this place doesn't step it up! It is pretty much an overpriced bar. They have a large selection of just mediocre bar food. I love the concept and it's tons of fun for kids. But I can't bring myself to go here again because I can't bare the food. They have no healthy options on their kids menu and it's not much better on the regular menu. I consider this place a kid-friendly restaurant due to the atmosphere and concept. But the service is way too slow! The number one thing that I look for when bringing kids out to eat is fast service. It's no secret that kids have no patience for waiting 15+ minutes for a check. And happy kids equal happy customers. Crying and winy kids equal annoyed and unhappy customers. So speed it up at least please!

So be warned, this place only has pizza to eat, nothing else. But the pizza is great! New York style, thin crust which is my preference. And if you don't want it too greasy avoid adding meats to it. Just stick with cheese.

It really hurts my heart to give this dog park one star. When the weather is cool I spend a lot of time here. But both of my dogs got bordetella last time I was there. My dogs are my children and anything thy gets them sick deserves one star. It's unfortunate because it's not really the park, it's more the people that go to this park. Time and time again I see puppies way to young to be at a dog park. I have also seen dogs that do not look healthy or properly cared for here. So I'm over it! I will drive a little bit to go to a nicer dog park that has people that take care of their pets.

What's not to like about ikea? Drop your kids off and shop, shop, shop! The merchandise is of quality that you would expect due to the low pricing. They have just about everything under the sun! If you've never been and would like the full ikea experience, plan at least 2 hrs to browse the store. And another 30 mins to check out. But it's well worth it!

This is my favorite bar to go to in Tempe by FAR! For those who don't know this is a dueling piano bar. You can request songs by putting cash on the pianos, but there is really no need. They will eventually get to every song imaginable for a piano bar. And if you have something unique you'd like to hear, plan to wait an hr or give $20 toward it. Just a heads up.   Now if you go on the weekend and would like a table where you can actually see I recommend getting there by 9pm the latest. And if you have a party of more than 4, be there by 8pm. No joke, this place gets packed. And there is a $5 cover as well. But don't we bothered by that because the drinks are very reasonable so that makes up for it.   The basement atmosphere really helps to set the mood here. Once you have a few drinks flowing through your blood you will be singing along to Billy Joel and Madonna. Now drink up you b*tch, you Slut, you whore! (you'll get in once you go) ;-)

I have been to my fair share of dog parks in every part of the valley, and I have to say that this one tops them all. It has two active dog areas and one passive dog area. They have agility equipment for the dogs to work on as well as a sand pit to play in. It is very large with lots of benches to sit and water fountains to stay hydrated. The best part about this park is the shade! The have large, mature trees that provide tons of shade to stay out of the Arizona sun. A+ from me and my two pups!

This is a solid pub. The atmosphere was nice and service was good. The best part is their great happy hour and specials. Happy hour is 4-7pm daily. Half off appetizers and $2 off beer and wine. the mussels were pretty big and very tasty. We also ordered the jalapeno onion flatbread which was a little soggy but had good flavor. I would go back here again for sure!

I've been to this park a few times and it is always very run down. The playground equipment is not in the best shape and is very dirty. The sand is also pretty gross with lots of trash and debris. The picnic tables are falling apart and there isn't much shade. Even the pond looks yucky at times. I do stop by here sometimes early in the morning for a quick run around the park which is nice because it is so open.

I cannot say enough about Kim and The Kim Courtney Swim School! I am a nanny of two boys, ages 3 and 4. They went to Aquasafe Swim School twice a week for over a year and their progress was very slow. The boys were not being challenged and often complained about going. Since we've made the switch, it's only been one month and the boys are very close to swimming independently. They LOVE going to "swim school" as they call it, and talk about it daily. All of the instructors are knowledgable, patient, and very good with the kids. Kim is also great. She gets in the pool often, and knows all of her students on a first name basis. I'm very impressed at how fast the boys have progressed in such a short period of time. I highly recommend this swim school to anyone that wants their kiddos to learn how to swim and be safe in the water quickly.

My friend and I when here one day for lunch and we were both very impressed. Both of our dishes were beyond delish! We also had kiddos with us and though they didn't have a kids menu they still catered to them and had no problem they were with us (of course they were very well behaved). I took a look at their dinner menu and though it is a little pricy I really want to go back and give it a try. I love all of the seafood options! Service and atmosphere were both very nice as well.

I am removing one star from this place because of the extremely slow service. This is an order at the counter place, so you expect it to be a little bit faster. But that's not the case. You actually wait longer than a sit down restaurant. I would subtract more stars due to the frustration every time I visit, but the food is just that good! This is still a must try place. But if you are in a rush or have children with you, you might want to pass. Or call your order in so it's ready for pick-up.

This is the 4th nypd that I've eaten at and it's always good no matter what location you are at. The pizza is true new york style where you can give it a nice fold and chow down. The wings have incredible flavor and have a nice crisp to them.   One complaint- they only have dine-in on weekends. During the week you can order at the counter and seat yourselves if your in a hurry and don't have time for full service. Why only offer this on weekdays? They get just as packed on the weekend. I would eat here twice as often if I was about to get out of there a little bit faster. Don't need a waitress, thanks though.

3 times in 2 weeks should tell you thy this place is stellar! I have had both the basil chicken and the garlic pepper chicken. They are both super tasty. If you like spicy I would go hot over medium. All of their meat and veggie are very fresh. Service is good and to-go orders are very fast. The place is small and cute inside. Best part, they have brown rice! Yummy. This place is a MUST try!

Don't walk away from the pump at this station! I know you're not suppose to. But who doesn't run in for a quick cup of coffee or snack while you wait every now and then? The pump is suppose to stop automatically. Well not here. I saw a guy spend $107 on gas overflowing out of his tank while he was talking to the rude attendant. Bad day for him.

I stopped going to Bark and Purr because I moved to Tempe about a year ago. After trying several groomers in my area and not being satisfied, I decided to take the road trip over to Bark and Purr and I was not disappointed! I have an extremely hairy german shepard, and this time of year his shedding is out of control. He came home weighing 10 pounds less than when I dropped him off! He was happy and taken great care of. He also has epilepsy, therefore I am ultra nervous about leaving him with someone that doesn't know what they're doing. But I am never worried about leaving him here. The entire staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and Andre loves to see them. Trust is extremely important to me when you're talking about my animals, they are my children. And I have that 100% here. Because of that I will continue to do the 25 mile drive from now on. Even though I will be spending more on gas, I'm saving on the grooming price. They are extremely affordable!!

I have to preface that every time I've visited this location it has been after midnight and I might have been pretty intoxicated. With that said, yummy yummy drunken food! I love that they are open after the bars close. I love to get a side of hot sauce to dip my sandwich in. Nice tool to soak up the alcohol.

Very impressive! Loved their service and style. The chips and salsa had an interesting flair to it. The chips were a mixture of tortilla and wonton type chips. The salsa had a peppery flavor which was really cool. I ordered the skillet chicken which was very yummy. My hubby got the street tacos which he really enjoyed as well. He ordered a margarita and I went with the berry bubbly martini which were both delicious and very strong which is a plus. The bill was right at about $50 bucks with tip which isn't too bad considering we drank alcohol.   We also had a living social deal that expired almost a month prior and they still honored it. We will definitely be back and we'd also love to try their other restaurant, Rhythm and Wine!

This place really hit the spot! I'm from Jersey so it's pretty hard to earn a 5 star from my on a NY style pizza place. But this place did it perfect. A lot of times I find that places in AZ tend to be way to greasy. Yo Pauly's had the perfect amount of grease. You can order by the slice and they are nice and big and nice and flat, perfect to fold in half. I also ordered a house salad that was very fresh with yummy house dressing. I can't wait to go back and try some hot wings! Lucky I work right in the area so I will be back often.

OMG this is seriously my favorite place to eat on mill. I love that you can get a super tasty burrito quickly and hang out and have a drink at the bar. And they are really cheap. I would highly recommend the pork. It's shredded and has a nice kick to it.

I love anything that's free! The orbit picks up right in front of my house and goes down to Mill Ave and all over Tempe. It runs every 15 minutes which is super convenient. I've never had to wait longer than that too which is nice. My one complaint is that it stops running too early on the weekends. They would save a lot of college kids DUI's if they would run until the bars close. Hey, I would take it!

I love this place! It's a cute place to bring kids. They will get a fire hat and can take a look at the real fire suits and helmets too. They one thing that drives me crazy about this place is that you can't get a kids sandwich on wheat bread. So I always have to order the kiddos an adult sandwich since I don't feed them white bread. Kind of a bummer.

New York style pizza by the slice. Yum yum! This place is reasonably priced, has good service and quality ingredients. They also have an awesome bakery. The atmosphere isn't the greatest, but the food is well worth a visit. Too bad they don't deliver!

Best sushi ever! Great happy hour too. 3-6 and 8-close they have $5 rolls and cheap drinks. They have some unique sushi. My favorite is the heart attack! The environment is really nice too. You won't be disappointed by trying this one!!!

This service was soooo bad I can't give this place any more than 1 star. The sushi was pretty good, but not worth the frustration of dealing with the slow service. Mind you I always go to a sushi bar planing to spend a good amount of time there. We were in no rush. Bur listen to this!  I checked in as we were seated which helped me keep track of time. The waitress took our order shortly after we were seated, great! Then over 45 minutes later my husband and I got our rolls. Well we were with another couple and we had ordered separately. I know they were aware of this because they had us write our names on the order sheets so they wouldn't get mixed up. So we didn't want to start eating yet since they didn't get their food yet. So we waited. And waited. And waited. 25 minutes later their rolls came out. By then we had shared our rolls with our friends because we were all starving. So it ended up working out okay. But come on! The place wasn't even packed. There were several empty tables. The weirdest part is that all the servers stand in a little group in the back of the restaurant and just watch everyone. I guess they stand clear of angry people wanting their food. Come on chefs. Step it up!

This place is probably the best sushi I've ever had. We shared 4 different rolls and I loved all of them! Sorry I don't remember the names, but I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed in anything you order. I love the Peruvian food options on the menu as well. Purple potatoes, yummy! My favorite roll was the one with pear in it. I know, who would've thought pear would be good in a sushi roll but man, it was to die for.   The decor was also very unique. They artwork on the wall was something to look at. I was also very impressed by the fast service right in the middle of the lunch rush on a Sunday. This place is for sure a must try while on the strip!

I threw my friends bachelorette party here this Sat and had an amazing time! Though this place is very fancy and classy they are super laid back with the partying and drinking. Makes for a perfect mix! We went all out and got a table with bottle service and two rooms to stay in. They gave us a bottle of champagne for free and brought it up to the room for us to toast which was cool. We had 18 girls in two rooms and we didn't get one complaint! We stayed at shade, the club upstairs by the pool, until 2am and then changed into our swimsuits to go for a dip in the pool. I love how the pool never closes so you can drink all night long! Shade also plays great music which we loved. Good mix of different stuff so everyone was happy.  I did have a little bit of issues with the woman who booked our table. Her name was Haley. She was not very responsive and didn't return my calls, emails or texts. I wanted to decorate our table but wasn't sure what was allowed and she never answered my questions. But the night of the party I mentioned this to the manager and she brought us a free bottle of champagne and sincerely apologized for the trouble. This was enough of a redemption for us. It couldn't have went better! Thank you W for an awesome and memorable night!!

I absolutely adore Tempe beach park! I am so lucky to live just one quick mile away from here. I run in this park and around the lake a few times a week and it is always clean, safe and busy but not too packed. Tempe wouldn't be Tempe without this park. I heart Tempe!

I participated in this years Phx 10k and was very impressed. I loved how when racers turned around you can see them on the other side of the light rail. I was able to see my friends as they raced which really helped to keep me going. They also when "green" this year which is awesome! We received a virtual race bag that had all of our coupons and goodies online. I will be participating in this race next year for sure. Might even have to do the doubleheader!

I can indulge on these burgers any day. And the best part about it is that I don't have to feel guilty about it! They have tons of healthy options such as turkey and veggie burgers on a whole wheat bun. I would recommend to build your own burger. The options are endless! I really like the ordering system they use here. You will get a check sheet to fill out your order and mark what you want on your burger. This makes it easy to decide what you want and I'm sure easier on the servers and cooks!   Reading other reviews I noticed that I missed out on the fried pickles. I will be trying those the next time I visit here for sure!

I cannot believe I almost forgot to review this place! Thank you yelp for your lovely check-in reminders;-)  I had an interesting experience here. I ordered take-out and loaded up 2 young kids to go pick it up. I ordered raviolis for the little ones and a salad for myself. Once I got home I noticed that my salad dressing was not in the bag. Really??? Grrr was all I had to say. I was not about to load up the hungry kids and drive back out for salad dressing. So I fed them and used the lovely kraft italian dressing I had in the fridge. Yum, I know. But I thought I'd give the restaurant a call and let them know of the mistake. I informed the woman who answered the phone. She said I could come back and get it and I refused. Well, not 30 seconds later Marco himself called me and offered to drive the salad dressing to me himself, personally. I know! I told him everyone makes mistakes and I understand. Of course I didn't make him drive it out to me. But what that phone call did was make me a repeat customer for life. All business owners should learn this lesson and make every customer happy! It will pay in the long run.

Dr Struble is wonderful! I am a nanny and have cared for lots of kids. With that comes a lot of experience with pediatricians. Dr Struble tops them all! She never rushes, answers all of your questions plus some, and is extremely devoted to her patients. She has a great memory too! She is a mom too that can relate to all of your feelings as a parent and will never take any question or issue lightly.

If you like sweet starbucks drinks you will LOVE this place. They have a great selection of drinks you can order either hot, iced, or blended. And they are cheaper than starbucks too! Even if the line is a little bit long they are quick. And the staff is beyond friendly. I swear they must seriously love their job! I would recommend the annihilator.

Yummy! You have to have a serious appetite to finish a plate from here. The half omelette is bigger than any full I've seen. And someone at a table near by got the pancakes and they were huge! There was 4 of us that all ordered different things and everyone really enjoyed their meals. I ordered the Denver omelette and the ham inside was soooo good. Very juice and tender. Cute little place inside to. Diner feel for sure.

I cannot believe I haven't written a review for reach 11 yet. This is my absolute favorite place to run in the valley! There are tons of trails that are hard packed dirt which is a great surface to run on. It's very easy to maneuver around the loops and their are mile markers and maps every so often if you feel lost. I've have ran so many training miles and have even raced on the trails here before. This is truly a runners heaven!!

I cannot say enough great things about my London Bus experiences. Jonathan is very accommodating and makes the evening such a blast. He is great at communicating while you are planning your event and will answer any questions you have through email or by phone. I am a planner and like to know every detail and he provided me with that.  I've been on both the downtown and the Scottsdale pub crawl and both were so much fun! The bus was fully stocked with beer, wine coolers for the ladies and water of course. We also got free shots at one bar and discounted drinks at another. They pick the perfect places to go that can accommodate the large number of people. I can't wait until my next London Bus extravaganza!!!!!

This is a solid fast food burrito bar. The make fresh tortillas to order that is by far the best part about this place. The queso is also very delish! My husband got the steak and I got the chicken and both were very good. If you want spicy I would recommend adding jalapeños because without it there isn't much spice. I also like how they mix the ingredients up before wrapping up your burrito. It's always annoying to get a big bite of meat or rice with nothing else.   I do wish they had wheat tortillas or brown rice to help make it a little more healthy. But hey, it is a burrito, right?

This is a great quick place to shop if you want to be in and out. It is very small bug has all of the essentials. My one complaint is that they don't have much of a selection in produce. And if they have a buy two deal you have to buy two. For example I was there last night and needed a cucumber. Well they only had packages of two so I had to buy two. What a waste but I really needed one.

This is my kind of place, and if happens to be walking distance from my house. Score!! Wine and beer tasting in a very relaxed atmosphere, with a good selection of both. The Thai food restaurant will deliver food over or you can brig your own good in as well. A prefer this over crapy, fried bar food. This is my new favorite Tempe spot!

This is a perfect place to make a quick stop on your way home to grab some milk, eggs, produce or other basic needs. It is a little more pricy than a chain grocery store of course, but you are supporting local farms and businesses when shopping here which is worth the extra buck.   Some fun things you can find here that is hard to find in other stores is kombucha, dr hummus and they even have a nice little coffee shop inside the store as well.

This place has a very good egg salad. And considering this is a deli where you order from the counter, they have good service. They refill your water, clear plates, and bring you what you need. For a reasonable price this is a good place to grab a quick lunch.

We ordered takeout from here and wasn't disappointed. They were very fast and friendly when we picked it up. My husband ordered sweet basil which could've used quite a bit more basil. I ordered spicy fried rice and it was very good. The prices we reasonable. Our bill was less than $20. This is definitely a family-owned restaurant which I really liked. They had a cute little bar in their with a great selection of Asian beers. Next time I go I will eat in so I can try some!

I really hate to give this place a bad review, but I have to keep it real. I was very disappointed with the food here. I ordered takeout and a friend picked it up so I wasn't able to scope out the ambiance. So this review is based on takeout food quality only.   We started with the appetizer that was like a sampler (I don't remember what they called it.) My favorite thing of the whole meal was the potstickers with the sauce that came with it. These were tasty. Everything else in this app I could go without. The chicken skewers were super dry with little flavor. And the egg rolls, meh. For the main course I ordered the spicy cucumber salad with chicken. Spicy it was, but flavorful it was not. Heat that is lacking flavor is no fun. You can tell they also put way too hot chicken in the cold salad so it made the cucumbers taste very soggy and warm. It was so funky that I didn't eat it, I shared with my friend. She ordered the chicken with garlic sauce. It was okay, but nothing special. It barely had any chicken in it and was full of water chestnuts. Don't get me wrong, I love water chestnuts! But this was just over the top.   Even though I was not impressed, I will return to try this place in person. I want to trust my fellow yelpers and hopefully they will come through for me!

Elvis, Elvis all day long! It's a nice, icy blend of peanut butter, banana, whey protein and mocha. It's a little pricey (around $7), but I typically drink half of it and save the rest for the next morning. The caffeine content is high enough to do the job even if you don't drink it all in one sitting. They also have a rewards card, buy 5 get the 6th free. So the higher price is offset if you stop by on the reg.   Sunday's they have an awesome omelet bar, made to order. They have a wide variety of meats and veggies you can choose from. And it's served with some delish fresh salsa and cheesy potatoes. Order an ice cold mimosa and you'll be set!

This place is great! I am a nanny and took the 4 year old boy I care for here. It is a wonderful place to take your well-behaved little ones. They give you a headset for no additional charge so you can have the full experience. As you walk from country to country your headset will follow as well by playing music from that country. This really helped to keep the kids attention. They also have an interactive room where the kids can play with all sorts of different instruments from all over the country.   My one complaint is that the ladies at the front desk as well as two different volunteers were extremely rude about bring children into the museum (we had a group of about 5 kids and 4 adults). On the website it was pretty clear that they are kid friendly. Yet they were obviously not excited to have the munchkins there to visit. But who cares! Still take your little ones because this is something wonderful for them to experience.

You wouldn't think this would be a good place to take children for haircuts, but it is! They are patient, have boosters and will put cartoons on the tv for them. They are efficient, and still do a really good job.   You can now make appointments which really helps with kids. I've been bringing the boys I nanny for here for over a year and I've never had a bad experience.   Side note: The alteration lady located in side is also really good and a sweetheart!

I starting going to this location of European Wax Center about 6 months ago because I was getting ingrown hairs that wouldn't go away. I've been to several other locations, as well as other waxing places. I started seeing Shana every 4 weeks and she is AMAZING! I've been waxing for over 5 years now, and I've never had someone quite as amazing as her. She is fast, consistent, and knows how to handle those stubborn ingrown hairs. She is also very accommodating with my schedule, and understands when I'm in a rush. She is super friendly and very genuine. I couldn't be happier with the services she provides me with on a monthly basis.

Considering the amount of people that run this race, all doing the same distance, it was extremely well organized. There were parts where I felt like I could run faster but the crowd held me back. But that should be expected at a race this size.   The route was a nice challenge with some fun hills. And running into the stadium for the finish line was such an experience!   This will be a race I do year after year. Can't ask for more than to run in honor of such an amazing American!

I am sorry but I am just not impressed with this place. I've been here twice and will probably never go back again. It is way overpriced for what you get. Even if you stop at every single exhibit and read every word you will still be done with the whole place in one hour. It's just not worth the money. They've also been advertising new sea turtles all over the valley yet we didn't see them anywhere. There wasn't staff around to ask either. And both times I've been they've had one of the feel tanks closed. That is the only hands on thing to do in the entire place so it's a bummer they don't keep it open. Unless you have some killer coupons to get in I wouldn't waste your time!

Wow! This place is awesome. The Mexican hot dog is to die for. They make their own salsa and it tasted like they make their own bread too. The fries were fresh. And my husband and I both ate lunch for less than 8 bucks. I ate here on a Sunday and walked in at 1030. I didn't notice that they don't normally open until 11 but the guy was super cool and warned me it would take an extra few minutes, but had no problem serving me. It was well worth the wait!

Last night we had a group of 10 people excited and ready for some cosmic bowling! We arrived about an hour before it started, and all the lanes were already reserved. What a bummer! But the lady at the counter saved the night. She said that if any groups don't show she would give them a courtesy call, and we can have their spot. Lucky us, a group canceled so bowling was on!!   From 8:30pm-1am if you have a group of 5 it's only $11 per person. They have a live dj that just happens to be an old suns player. The atmosphere was super cool for a Saturday night.   Kind of interesting bowling alley food, they are attached to a Mexican good restaurant that you can order Mexican food or bar food and they bring it to your lane. I was a little skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised with how good everything was.   Overall I would highly recommend checking out these lanes. It's a guaranteed great time!

Really people? You are pretty harsh on this one and can I say, you are way off! I guess if you're use to Scottsdale salons then this is not the place for you. Don't waste your time. But for a down-to-earth chick like me, I loved it! I first went here to use my groupon for a pedi and had Tabby. I loved the decor and atmosphere. Tabby was also wonderful and did a great job. I love that you get a complimentary drink during your service too.   My second visit I went back for an express pedi and rockstar toes. This is the third place I've done gels on my toes and it is by far the cheapest and best I've had. If you just to rockstars its $25 and $35 with a pedi. You won't find that deal anywhere. Gel toes are more expensive than an average pedi at all places because it's quite a bit more work and time do do and lasts super long. Mine normally lasts me about 8-10 weeks. You just have to file them a bit as the grow. Don't clip them though! They will also do Shellac for only $15. Once again, cheapest I've seen.   My next visit is going to be an after party with my girlfriends. They will do an after party for a min. of 4 girls, max. of 12. There is no extra charge for this and you get the whole place to yourself. Plus every girl gets 20% off of any services they get. You can also email them a playlist and they will play whatever music you like. And just like normal, everyone gets one complimentary alcoholic beverage. They will also cater your party. For $5 per person you can get apps and for $10 you will get a full meal. How cool is that! I will be sure to update my review after our party and let you know how it goes. I'm sure it will be nothing less than fabulous!   Now I would like to take a minute to counter some of these harsh reviews. For those who complain about not getting a hold of them by phone, use your computer! They have a great system on their website where you can schedule, reschedule, and cancel your appointments with a click of the mouse. It is so much easier than calling in! And they send you email confirmations and reminders. Also, give up on the bucket complaints! Haven't you seen on Oprah the nasty foot fungus people get from the spa pedis? That is because those jets that shoot water on you feet fill up with other people's grimy foot bacteria and transfers it to you. I would WAY rather have a nice steel bucket that they can sanitize after each use. And don't be shy, ask for hot water.

I feel so lucky to live within a few miles of this place! They have wonderful breakfast for so cheap. I order their breakfast special that comes with one egg, potatoes, and biscuits and gravy for only $2.99. Then I order a side of bacon for $2.50 which comes with 4 slices. It's worth it to spend the extra for the bacon because it is so tasty. The bacon is peppered and cooked perfect with a nice crisp but not burnt. And the biscuits and gravy are ridiculous! They are the best I've ever had by a long mile. So for $5.50 you will be stuffed and your tummy will be satisfied!

I used a groupon for lunch at this place which was a smoking deal. And I really wanted to like it. I really did. But unfortunately the food was just not good. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap. The tortilla was very dry which made the whole thing fall apart. I had to cut it up and eat it with a fork. And if it wasn't for a few drops of buffalo sauce that I saw but couldn't taste, I probably would have sent it back thinking it wasn't what I ordered. It didn't taste like it had any sauce what-so-ever in it. I would've guessed it was a grilled chicken wrap with no sauce. And the little "salad" that came on the side was more like some leaves of lettuce with a drop of oil on them. There was no flavor at all!  This place does deserve some credit for the atmosphere. The place is super cute and the service was good. All of the staff was very friendly and I really liked the feel of the place. Which made it even more upsetting the food didn't match the ambiance. But I will give this place another try. Maybe in the evening because it looks like it might be a cool place to chill and have a drink!

I'm not much of a coffee drinker but I tend to visit coffee shops often for tea. Tullys had a great variety of teas. They had 5 different kinds of green tea alone. It had great flavor. One complaint is that I ordered it iced and it was so hot that the ice melted within minutes which watered it down. At starbucks they shake the tea in a shaker to cool it off. I might just have to ask them to do that next time.

Let me start off by saying that I LOVE hippies. They make me smile. So I was so excited once I moved to east Phx and now have 2 two hippies close by. I had never eaten at one before and I had high expectations.   My first experience was nothing less than stellar. I went with a hot dog with jalapenos, onions and cheese. They dog was definitely all beef. They sliced it in half and loaded it up which made it that much better. And the bun was lightly toasted which always adds nice texture. I also got an order of fries. They were my kind of fries for sure! They were the crinkly ones and seasoned. They were not to crispy which is how I like it. The prices were very affordable as well. I can't wait to go back to try some tacos. Fish tacos are next on my list!

This place is very impressive. The food is all made in house and made with natural ingredients. You can really taste the difference! And the service was great too!

This is my new favorite spot! The pizza and wings here are amazing. The wings are super crispy with a nice flavorful sauce. I would recommend the hot ones, because the medium is lacking a bit of heat. The pizza is also to die for. The cheese is very fresh and all of the toppings are very fresh. The sangria is soooo good too. It really does rival postinos. If the weather is nice, sit on the patio. Finally, the prices are extremely reasonable. A large pizza is only $12. My husband couldn't believe it when I told him!

I have given this place two shots and I will NOT be giving them anymore chances. I enjoy iPic and really wanted to like Salt as well. Unfortunately they have the worst service EVER! I went for some pre-drinks with my girlfriends (8 of us) and the place was dead. We each ordered a couple of drinks (drinks were mediocre and very overpriced). I still hadn't purchased my movie ticket so I asked for my check a few minutes before my friends were ready to go. The bartender, Zack, asked me with an attitude "so you want separate checks?" I answered yes, so he crinkled up our bill and threw it in the trash with such a rude demeanor! I always assumed that when a group of ladies were ordering alcoholic beverages at a bar that we would want to pay for them separately. We weren't eating at a table, we were sitting at the bar. If that were the case I would've been more understanding. Overall they were extremely slow and rushing around acting like the place was packed even though it was just us. Then the manager said that they just had 400 people come through there in movies so that was the reason they were slow. My thought.. if you are a high end movie theater charging over $20 per ticket you should be well staffed to handle those types of numbers. It's not like they can't predict when the rushes will come. I would think they are well aware of which movies are popular. Maybe they should vary movie times so you are more equip to handle them. We were there to see The Hunger Games a week after it came out so of course it was going to get busy. What did they expect?!? Not to mention the restrooms were a disaster with no soap and toilet paper everywhere.   The only reason I gave them two stars was because of the food. I've had several different appetizers there and they were all very tasty. At least the chefs know what they are doing in this place!

Stellar! This place not only had tasty yogurt, but awesome customer service as well! The woman working behind the counter came out to see if we had any questions or would like to try a sample. Then the owner, Sue came and introduced herself and thanked us for coming in. She was very friendly and pleasant which made me want to come back to this location for sure!   Now onto the yogurt. This is a self-serve place which is always my favorite. You can get as many flavors as you want and load it up with unlimited amounts of toppings. I am a nanny so I have been to so many different yogurt places. This one had more toppings then the rest! My favorite topping is mochi which most places normally have. Well this place didn't just have it, they had three different flavors. I have never seen that before and I was super excited about it! Mango, strawberry, or rainbow. How do you chose? Easy, just throw them all in. Yum yum yum!

This is now my new favorite place in Tempe! It is quick, cheap and delicious! My husband and I were looking for some quick Mexican food and decided to give it a try. We were promptly greeted and asked if we had been there before. Once we said now we were handed tons of samples and thoroughly explained the menu to us. Man, it was hard to choose because they have so many meet options and they all tasted so good. I went with the green chili pork and my husband went with steak. Both were ridiculous! I love how they have healthy options too like wheat tortillas and black beans. The jalapeño cream cheese was also very good. I'd love to smother that all over a bagel in the morning. Try this place people! You won't regret it!!!

I am actually pretty shocked by all of the 5 star ratings! This place is small, overpriced, and doesn't have healthy lunch options. And if your not going to offer healthy lunch options then you should either allow re-entry or allow outside food to be brought inside. They do not allow either of these options. This is very frustrating considering the price you pay. It is $9 per child. One parent per child can play for free which is nice. But if you have multiple kids this can get very pricy. The children's museum is only $2 more and you can bring your own food or leave for lunch and come back. And it is huge so you can easily spend an entire day there. I would recommend trying that instead. But if you are in the desert ridge area and want to beat the heat, give it a try. Don't forget socks!

I recently discovered this park and was so excited! They have two playgrounds, one for younger and one for older kids. They also have two sets of swings and lots of grass to run and play in. It was very quiet and calm when we went which I love. I will now be a regular at this park I am sure!

We ordered delivery from here after 2am and they were quick, friendly, and cheap! The cheese steaks were tasty and they have a good delivery area, we live on the other side of Tempe. This will be my new go-to late night delivery place. Sorry Jimmy Johns, you've been replaced!

I am beyond excited about this new discovery! I discovered this place last week and plan to go for the 3rd time already tomorrow. I am excited to be a regular here at this locally owned business. They are the definition of a 5 star spot! They go above and beyond with all that they do. The wine selection is good and very diverse. They even offer my FAVORITE red wine, Apothic, which I've never seen in a wine bar before. They also have fabulous, made in-house red and white sangria's. The spinach artichoke dip is the best I've ever had! And believe me when I say I've had my fair share of spinach artichoke dips. The atmosphere is exactly what I look for in a wine bar. I cannot wait until the weather cools down so I can spend more time on the amazing patio. I've only peeked but I can tell I will be in love in a few months from now. The service here is just as impressive! The bartender, Amy is so cute and such a sweetheart! She it also meticulous when she shines all of those glasses. Looks like a lot of work but she handles it with ease. This place is at the top of my list. I better be careful or I will be a wino in no time!!

Bueno is right! Their AZ burger is delish! The wheat bun was soft and fresh. I loved the green chili on top of the burger. They have no problems with substitutions or specialized orders which is always a plus to me. The fries were super tasty too. And $7.50 for a meal isn't too shabby for some quality food. You go Bueno Burger!

I would call myself a regular here. My softball team goes almost every Friday after our game. If you are going to eat I recommend any burger. You can't go wrong! The service is hit or miss depending on who you get. They always have good drink specials, different ones each night. They also have pool tables, but they fill up quick on the weekends. Overall it's a pretty solid place. It keeps us coming back week after week.

I was beyond impressed with my first experience here. So much that I would even say this is my new favorite spot in Tempe! The service was impeccable. The atmosphere was comfortable, with nice decor. Best part, the food! I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was perfect. I was with 3 other people that had also never been there before and everyone agreed that it was great! I cannot wait until my next visit so I can try the sushi.

This is a great place with lots of fun things for little ones to make. Anything from soap to cake! I am a nanny and took the kids that I care for here to make father's day gifts. I have to say I was a little taken back by the prices. We spent about $100. Yikes!! But the kids did enjoy the experience and everything they made turned out adorable. The staff is also very hands on and attentive. It can be a little overwhelming even as an adult to know where to start and what to do. But they were right there helping us every step of the way.

Best dog food prices in the valley! The toys are not too badly priced either. The staff is very knowledgable about high end dog food and always available to help. They also offer the 10th bag of dog food for free with some select brands. They have been helpful for me with selecting a good quality food that is reasonably priced for my pups who I treat like me kids. It means a lot!

This has been one of our favorite parks for years! It is always clean, partly shaded in the summer and has clean restrooms. It doesn't get too packed either which is nice. I love the layout because it is very spacious and open so you can pretty much see your kids no matter where you are standing on the playground. They have a covered ramada too so you can sit and have lunch after the kids are all played out.

Cute, quick place to stop in for a lunch on your lunch break. They go above and beyond with little details like cucumber in the water and coolers on the patio. You can tell the owner takes pride in his business and cares about the customers. The food was very fresh and put together well. Overall I think this is a solid addition to my lunch choices in Scottsdale.

My newest addiction here is the oatmeal. It is made with quinoa, which sounds a little odd. Don't knock it until you try it, you won't regret it! Have I mentioned how awesome the staff here is too?! This is my favorite places to go when I first wake up. A day that starts at D'lish is guaranteed to be a perfect one.

I've been here quite a few times and they have items on the menu that sound like they'd be great, but they are just never overly impressive. I've gotten the piña colada salad before and it's always a little dry and the lettuce isn't fresh. All of the sandwiches are made on the same bread, it's white and very basic with no flavor. The rolls are served cold, fresh out of the fridge with no butter or anything to put on it. With some simple improvements and attention to detail this place could be a solid 4 stars. But as of now this is the best I can do!

I am in love with OTF! It's seriously the best workout you can get in an hour. I love how it just flys by. It's similar to circuit training, but you wear a heart monitor and your heart rate is displayed on a screen. It helps to push me a little bit harder so I stay in the "orange zone" longer. The staff is also super friendly and very responsive. I highly recommend checking out Orange Theory Fitness! They offer a free trial class as well.

I stopped in for a quick iced peppermint mocha and was very impressed all around. The staff was extremely friendly and excited to chat about the business. This place is not your typical coffee shop. They have tons of space to meet up and relax. They are also an art gallery with some beautiful pieces to look at. Culture is a good way to describe this business because they are really bringing a unique culture and vibe to the downtown Phoenix area. I always excited to discover places like this and support them with my business. I encourage everyone to check this place out and keep it alive!!

This is a very cute bar, love the decor. Service was good and prices reasonable. The food was good and they had good drink specials. Lots of different mind erasers which are a blast! Good place to watch football as well. They have a DJ that plays music during commercial breaks which keeps the vibe fun and light. I hope this places lasts! That location is know as a death wish. Fingers crossed!!

Dr hummus is one of my biggest addictions! I love the fresh pita chips with cilantro jalapeño hummus. It is tahini free which means much less fat and calories. Overall a healthier option than your average hummus. It is a little bit pricier, but well worth it. Bring this to a party and you can't go wrong!

I am extremely impressed with this new, local coffee shop! First off, the coffee is amazing. When I walked in I was warmly greeted by the employees, and the owner introduced himself as well. This place doesn't lack in customer service!  They also have a cute little "kids corner" that your little ones can play in while you drink your coffee or have a bite to eat. I can't wait to give some of their food a try. Biscuits and gravy! Paninis, sandwiches and salads as well. And of course, food and drink options for your little one.

For a quick, in and out lunch I have been repeatedly impressed with this place. First, the ordering process is very simple and low stress. You start by selecting a bag for the item you'd like to offer. Each bag has a list of the toppings that you can check off. It's as simple as that. No going down the assembly line peeking over the glass trying to decide what you want while you hold up the line. Or worse yet, getting caught behind the indecisive customer that stares at the toppings for hours. At Which Wich, you hand them your order bag filled out, pay, and then wait. They are super quick too!   The menu is huge but broken up into categories which makes it easier to decide on an item. I don't eat bread, so I order the lettucewich and it is amazing! They have a similar option at Jimmy John's, but the meat is always super skimpy, so I leave feeling not quite satisfied. At Which Wich, they give you plenty of meat and have so many options for toppings, I can barely finish one on my own. Sometimes the lettuce doesn't hold up to eat it like a sandwich, so I just ask for a bowl and eat it with a fork and knife. Still tastes the same, which is spectacular!

Robert, the bartender makes the bar here more than just a bar, he makes it's an experience. He is fun to watch and teaches his mixology techniques along the way. He teaches mixology classes here on Sunday afternoons. I've never been, but I can only imagine how much fun it would be.   My boyfriend and I go here often on a Sunday night to grab a cocktail before the work week begins. They offer happy hour all day on Sunday's which is great! Robert always has a new drink for us to try and it never disappoints. He outdoes himself every time. I can't say enough good things about this place. I look forward to trying their food soon. I'm sure it will exceed my expectations.

This smoothies here are delicious! I love, love, love the blimey limey! It has the right amount of sweetness with a little tart kick at the end. You can call ahead too, and they will have it ready and waiting for you. If only they had a drive-thru!   The food quality isn't the greatest, but it's not bad. I like the buffalo chicken wrap.

I went here with my friend to help him purchase a new kitchen table. After bringing it home and putting it together, we discovered that it wasn't the table we picked out. It was a different shape and height. We didn't want to take it apart and drive it all the way across town (he lives downtown), so I called down to the store to see what they could do.   The customer service over the phone was stellar! The man I spoke with looked up the order and discovered that the sales associate input the wrong item number when we checked out. He apologized for the inconvenience and offered to deliver the correct table, install it (which wasn't a fun process for the wrong one we received!), and take the old one back. He told us we could leave the wrong one as is and they would take care of the rest.   So though we went a few more days without a kitchen table because of their mistakes, they were quick to admit their mistake and do the best they can to make things right. Things happen. And when they do, this is the way it should be handled!

This is far the best nail salon in Scottsdale! All of the nail techs here are extremely knowledge and have your best interest in mind. They don't up-sale like most nail salons do. They even suggest more affordable options if it's best for your needs. They are very efficient and will have two techs work on your hands and nails at the same time.   PS- Don't forget to grab a punch card. I'm sure you'll be going back!

I am MAD hooked on mad greens! If you are looking for a quick, healthy, and affordable meal, this is this spot. Mad greens is a casual, order at the counter style restaurant. But the food quality is beyond impressive! They get the majority of their produce from local farmers daily. What's not to love about that?! They have over 20 different dressing to pick from for those salads such as spicy sriracha Almond Vinaigrette and fat free spicy yogurt (because I like it hot!).   And don't forget about the little ones. They have multiple healthy and likable options on their kids menu. All kids meals come with a fruit cup. But this is not your average packaged fruit cup soaking in sugary syrup like most places. They have tons of fresh fruit available and allow your kiddo to choose 3 different types to fill their cup. Kids love nothing more than to have choices, right?
