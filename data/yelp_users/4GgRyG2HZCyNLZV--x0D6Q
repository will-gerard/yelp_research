I have been to Cafe Lalibela about 5 or more times now, and my boyfriend and I LOVE their food.  For those of you who are opposed to eating with your hands or are not a big fan of vegetables, Ethiopian cuisine may not be a good option for you.  We took a friend and his date with us the other day, and although the girl  stated she was cool with anything, we could all tell that she wasn't enjoying it.  If steak, grilled chicken, potatoes and salad are the main staples on your palate, and you dislike deviating away from them, choose somewhere else.     My boyfriend and I have had just about everything on the menu, but we always come back to the vegetarian combo (number 15) as our favorite choice.  The platter is for 3 people, but we usually finish the platter between the two of us.  We always try to pick our favorite among the collard greens, lentils, green beans, cabbage, and peas, but we give up because they are all so good.  If you are a vegetable lover like us, I think you will find your favorite among their offerings.  The flavors in the dishes are all distinctively unique and delicious.  I think my opinion of Ethiopian food gets better every time I visit the restaurant.

I have been going to Munch a Mania for lunch with my boyfriend for about a year now.  My current sandwich crush is Veggie Galore with Turkey.  It comes loaded with sprouts, avocado, and cucumber slices, and the whole time I am stuffing my mouth I wonder how Gordon and Mary are making any money off of this sandwich.  The prices are extremely reasonable, and we usually walk out of there with spending about $10.  Even the deli counter at Sprout's grocery store can't beat Munch A Mania's prices and freshness. If you are person who likes the Mom & Pop feel and want the owners to get to know you, this place is perfect.

Ever since I have realized that caffeine helps to reduce my insanity by ten-fold, coffee has become the savior of my mental state.  Over time, my good friends have also understood this fact about my personality and have hunted down various coffee shops in the valley in efforts to save themselves and the rest of the population from my general obnoxiousness.  I must have been bothering one of my friends couple of weeks ago because she introduced me to Solo Café by stating flatly in a text: "You need coffee.  Come to Solo Café."  So, my relationship with Solo Café began, and I can honestly say that I have spent more time in Solo than I have with some people I have dated in the past.  I have produced my best work for my summer classes there because its calm vibe and the interesting artwork keeps me content, and the numerous outlets available throughout the Café feeds my pet - a.k.a. the laptop - as well.  As for the drinks, I can comment on their Americanos since that is the only thing I order at any coffee shop.  Solo Café's Americano is on the strong side, but it goes down smoothly without any milk.  Also, my insides have never screamed in pain after drinking a large cup of their Americano, so that is a positive sign.  My friend is more interesting than I am, so she orders different types of tea from time to time which all have had favorable reviews from her.  She tried the blue raspberry tea once, and it reminded me of a flavor from a packet of Skittles.  If you are not into the bitterness as I am, I'm sure you will find your niche in the variety of drinks Solo has to offer.   The baristas are always willing to assist in your decision making and to make you feel welcomed, so don't hesitate to ask for an opinion.

I was scheduling a pho-date with my girlfriend, and she suggested that we needed to go to Pho Chandler.  I live all the way up in Central Phoenix and a 38-minute-drive to Chandler did not sound appealing at all, but she swore that it was the best pho place in the valley.  My friend, boyfriend, and I sat down and the waitress remembered my friend well, and I thought that was cool.  It is always a nice touch when the people working in an establishment try to remember you.   I ordered a Vietnamese coffee and the others ordered glasses of orange juice.  My coffee came out quickly, but the juice took awhile.  I felt bad drinking my coffee and joked that they must be picking out oranges from a grove and freshly squeezing them.  And guess what?  They really came out FRESHLY SQUEEZED.  The sweetness from fresh oranges was worth the wait.  My friend and boyfriend were quite impressed and happy.    As for the food, we ordered a plate of pan-fried potstickers (tasted very fresh as well), and all of us ordered their seafood pho which is their specialty.  The broth is made from snow crabs, and you do get pieces of the crab in your soup.  The crab is actually REAL in an ACTUAL SHELL and not the imitation kind.  The crab not only makes the soup more flavorful, but it adds a sweetness to the dish.  My boyfriend wanted to add an assortment of veggies to his pho, and the waitress made it happen with a giant heap of green vegetables.    I would seriously recommend this place to everyone.  I have been dreaming about their seafood pho for the last three days and can't wait to go back.

For the last 5 years I have eaten at UnPhogettable, I have nothing but positive memories to share.  I ate here when my family and friends came into town for my graduation, and my friend's going away party was held at UnPhogettable. My parents talk about how good the pho was the last time they visited, and my boyfriend thinks their veggie pho is better than anywhere else.  I love that the same waitress that served me 5 years ago is still happy to see me when I come to dine, and I always enjoy the casual conversations I have with the owners each time I visit.  I think I feel like a part of the family when I enter this place, and perhaps that's why this restaurant is unforgettable in my opinion.  My favorite is #21 (seafood pho), but I have had most of the things on the menu by stealing some bites from my friends here and there.  The veggie pho (#23) is refreshing and has a clean after taste.  The rare steak and brisket (#9) seems to be a good choice for a person who has never tasted pho before.  There are plenty of other items on the menu starting from vermicelli bowls and grilled meats.  I think if you want to try some Vietnamese food that is consistently good, UnPhogettable would be a great place for you.

I dated a guy once who told me that Chinese food is like pizza because you can't really mess it up.  Well, the next time I run into him, I am going to send him to Jimmy Woo's.    For the last few weeks, I have had a weird craving for Chinese food, and just in case you are wondering, I'm not pregnant.  I decided to give Jimmy Woo's a try today since I drive by the place every day, and I am not a fan of P.F. Chang's across the street.    Wow. That was a mistake.    I ordered some noodles and pork dumplings, and I was shocked by how BLAND the food was.  If I could chew and swallow air, I think it would taste like the food I got today.  The pork had huge chunks of tendon within it that I couldn't eat half of the meat, and the sauce was so tasteless that I had to put some soy sauce on it which I absolutely hate doing.  Since my craving hasn't been satisfied by this experience, I am going to drive out to Chandler or Phoenix tonight for Chinese food praying for better.

I have read other people's reviews, and I was a bit surprised to hear that so many people had such a negative experience.  My lasar tech has been very helpful through the entire process.  She has always been attentive, and I saw definite results from the first day I went in for my Brazilian and armpit hair removal. She said that everyone has different types of hair/skin, so each person will have a varying range of time in which the hair is completely gone.  Fortunately for me, I don't have thick hair (despite the fact that I am Asian) and perhaps this has helped me to get the results I wanted.

Last weekend, my boyfriend and I visited Bisbee, AZ and met a gentlemen there who told me to visit Copper Blues when I returned to Phoenix.  I'm a big beer fan, so when he said that the bar had 60 plus beers on tap, I was ready to try the place out.    My best friend and I wandered into the bar around 8 pm on a Wednesday, and I was surprised to see many customers sitting around the bar and at tables.  We sat at the bar right in front of the stage, and the bartender greeted us promptly and took our order.  I was pleased to find some of my favorites on tap - Delirium Tremens, Lost Abbey, Chimay, etc.  For those of you who do not drink beer, they had a great liquor selection to choose from.    I thought it would be ridiculously loud sitting at the bar once the live music got going, but I could still carry on a conversation with my friend without screaming at her.  A reggae band was on stage that night, and they were quite entertaining.    The only thing that I really didn't enjoy was the food.  My friend and I were both quite hungry when we ordered the food, but it wasn't good enough for us to finish it even though we were starving.  We got a plate of wings and the chicken nachos.  The buffalo wings were quite salty and lacked flavor, and the honey hot wings were not hot and tasted just like honey was poured on the wings.  As for the nachos, the actual nacho chips were way to salty, the salsa didn't have any flavor, and the chicken topping was dry and cold.    I really enjoyed the atmosphere at Copper Blues.  I would definitely visit again to have some beer and cocktails, but I know I am going to pass on the food.

I recently bought a house after nine LONG months of the short sale process.  Although the house was gorgeous, the previous owners left the house in a total mess (pieces of long hair floating in the refrigerator, green carpet that looked gray because of animal fur, etc.).  I honestly really wanted to clean the house, but I just couldn't muster up the courage to dive right in.    I started looking around and called some bigger cleaning companies, but their quotes were ridiculous.  Also, on top of the crazy prices, none of them wanted to do what I wanted them to do - clean the ENTIRE house.  Many places stated they didn't wash windows, wipe the insides of cupboards, this, that, and the other which was a bit annoying.  You want me to pay you $400 to clean my house for four hours, and you are not going to do what I ask you to do?   So, I started searching on Yelp, and quite frankly, I liked the name "Addicted To Clean."  My mother is OCD (not kidding on this part), and she is literally addicted to cleaning.  Therefore, I figured I couldn't possibly go wrong with these people.    Jessica and Craig came right on time, and they walked through the house with me and listened to my request.  They started working right away, and when they were finished after 6 HOURS of cleaning, the house looked AMAZING.  They even took the time to clean up my yard waste, change my air filter, wiped down all of the windows and sliding doors, and vacuumed until my green carpet turned green again.  I could sit here and write down a whole list of what they did for me, but it is so long that I will leave it to your imagination.  (Besides that, Yelp has a tendency to filter out reviews that sound too nice. I know you, Yelp.)    On top of my bragging about Jessica and Craig's abilities, I paid a fraction of what everyone else was quoting.   I would go with them instead of other larger cleaning companies around Phoenix.  I hope great things happen to them because their business deserves to grow.

I survived through a 9-month hellish short sale process just to live closer to the numerous eateries that engulf this area.  So, "Hello, Culinary Dropout, we are both new to the neighborhood."    To be honest, I wasn't expecting a lot from the new Culinary Dropout because the original one on Camelback did not impress me that much.  (There is a certain smell to it that just does not work for my senses. Sorry!)  BUT, the new one is BEAUTIFULLY renovated with a fun atmosphere and is quite aesthetically pleasing in every way.  From the game area outside to the warmly lit dining area inside, the new Culinary Dropout mixes Olive 'n Ivy's charm with the Vig's outdoor concept.    The Yard will soon become the "go-to" place for those who need a break from the reality that is happening outside the fence.    The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of a solid 5 stars is because it does not deserve it yet.  I have been to the Culinary Dropout for the last two days just to give a quick and fair assessment, and the timing of the food is not all there.  I understand that your name implies you dropped out of culinary school, and it is my fault for going to eat at your place despite this issue.    However, you cannot serve me cold food.     The first day, I ordered three items from the appetizer section, the fried chicken platter, and the meatloaf dish.  The entrees and the appetizers came out about two minutes from each other.  The mashed potatoes and the biscuit were cold while the fried chicken was hot - indicating that the side dishes were just sitting there waiting until the chicken was deep fried.    The second day, I sat at the bar to get the feel of that area, and the appetizers took FOREVER to come out.  How long does it take to warm up some pretzels and melt cheese in a bowl?  Apparently, it takes about 45 minutes to an hour.  The bartender (who was awesome) felt bad, so he entertained me for the time being.  Overall, the food is a solid OKAY.  Food was never Fox Concepts' best trait in comparison to the better restaurants in the area, but I know that the company focuses on creating delightful hangout spot for its patrons.  I will definitely visit again soon to see how they progress through the upcoming months.

My friend and I went down the street to Little Cleo's this evening for dinner.  The parking (as usual) was a chaos around the Yard, and the neighborhood now had lighted signs saying that the parked vehicles will be issued a ticket (can't blame the neighbors).  The valet service is complimentary, and the guys working at the booth are always super friendly.  My valet ticket got lost in the restaurant today, and the guys did not give me a hard time at all.    We entered the restaurant around 5:45 on a Friday, and it was not busy.  We ordered the warm jar of king crab and bread, some oysters from New England and California, and the bouillabasse.    The warm jar of king crab was sweet and loaded with butter.  It is one of those love and hate relationships where it starts off so good then the butter just overloads you over time.   The oysters are on the more expensive side, but they are flown in from their respective waters daily - I suppose we are paying for their airfare.  That thought tends to make me feel better about the money I'm spending.    The best part of the meal was the bouillabasse.  The creamy tomato sauce over fresh scallops, shrimp, mussels and salmon was really to die for.         Loved the staff that was working tonight at the restaurant.  All of them were upbeat and looked like they wanted to be there.  They are also handing out 25% off coupons to use for the month of January.  So, get there fast!

I have eaten at four different Spinato's Pizza across the valley.  I am a big fan of their food and was excited for them when they opened on 7th Street because the building is prettier than their old 12th and Glendale location.    Yelp read my mind when it said, "Meh. I've experienced better."    I ordered the Mama's signature pizza via delivery.  It is not my first time getting a delivery order from them, so I was shocked when I felt the bottom of the box dripping with oil.  I'm not exaggerating when I say the box looked like it had been floating on a pile of water before arriving at my house.  I took a bite of the pizza and was even more disappointed.  The crust was crumbling because it was loaded with grease.  If I knew their quality would go down this badly after the change in location, I would have written to the owners everyday to convince them to stay where they were.

I have been praying for a perfect cocktail bar to open up in Phoenix since I moved here in 2009, and 5 years later, God finally answered my prayers.    My friend and I walked in around 5:30 on Thursday to find the bar about half full. We were both impressed by the high ceilings and the overall feel of the interior, and I kinda wished that we had dressed up more for the occasion.  But, the staff didn't seem to mind our flip flops and my ripped up Guns 'n Roses t-shirt, so we gladly stayed.    Interestingly, I recently read an article about the bar's reservation policy, but it didn't reflect our experience at Bitter & Twisted.  No one asked if we had reservations, and everyone was friendly.   We sat at the bar and were given a food menu and a booklet for the cocktails.  We did arrive during happy hour (4-7pm) but decided to get a meat and cheeseboard instead which is not a part of their HH special.  The pineapple sauce and the cauliflower in turmeric were my favorite on the board, and the bread was toasted just right.  I was being a snooper and looked at other customers' plates, and they all looked equally delicious.  I would love to try their "Seoul Fried Chicken" on my next visit and see if it really tastes like fried chicken from back home.    As for the cocktails, WOW. At the first glance, the cocktail booklet can be a bit overwhelming with written descriptions and pictures.  However, the bartender told us to look at the scatter plot at the back of the booklet that organized everything on one page.  I am a scientist.  Scientists like booze and scatter plots.  Therefore, I like booze and scatter plots.  I chose a refreshing, fruity cocktail while my friend asked the bartender to make her a citrus based martini with jalapenos.  They were both phenomenal in a different way.    My goal for this year is to try every single cocktail on their menu.  I highly recommend Bitter & Twisted to those who have been itching for a new hangout place just like me.
