Awesome customer service!!! Food was really good as well. Lobster lettuce cups are yum and the Smothered Chicken Brest was delicious. Cooked perfectly and very flavorful. Thank you 1130 for treating my bachelorette party with respect and making us feel special!

Horrible customer service! I made a reservation at Brick for my bachelorette party. When we called they said they could seat 12 people no problem. We showed up on time for the reservation and they said there was someone else who had already made a reservation and they could try to seat us at the bar instead. They had our phone number, but did they call to tell us this? No. So the hostess gets the manager. He apologizes about the reservation, but does not offer accommodations. We ask to receive a discount on the bill or perhaps happy hour pricing, but he says he cannot do anything. Thanks Brick for starting off my important night on a such a bad note. Luckily we were able to get in at 1130 next door and they had amazing customer service, even gave the entire party a free shot without us asking for it.
