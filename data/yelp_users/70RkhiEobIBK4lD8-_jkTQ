This particular location always has a crowd but the wait is never long & I've never experienced a bad drink here :)  The guy at the drive-thru window saw my dog in the car with me and offered him a "Pupiccino" LOL ( whipped cream in a small cup )

A bit upset, Super Dragon ruined it for me about a year ago. After my bf introduced me to this place I can no longer eat shrimp fried rice anywhere else in the valley, compared to SD, everything else is simply gross  LOVE SUPER DRAGON AND THE WORKERS

I could have sworn I had Rally's before in my lifetime, but after I tried those fries, there is no way that I had it before because I definitely would have remembered it! The fries are THE BEST! The burger wasn't anything special, definitely can settle for burger king since it isn't much of a difference. They really do have a lot to choose from, but I doubt if I'll try, I gag at the thought of a chili cheese burger..*eek*   Furthermore, I will be back for more fries!

I've been coming here with my family since I was a kid. Unfortunately, it seems as though the taste of the food has gone bad, new cooks perhaps?  Although there are many that still choose to eat here, I will no longer return especially after receiving poor customer service.

I had my Shih tzu groomed here last weekend, this was the best cut that he has ever received! Nice and even low puppy cut! And funny thing is, this place was the least expensive   I'll be back!

Cool place to hang out with a group of friends and enjoy sushi and a SUPERB price.  The rolls were big and only $3, I wish this place was closer to my side of town because I'd be there every weekend.  The waitress was so friendly and down to earth, I cant emphasize enough how great the food was and the price of everything made it THAT much better!    I'd go again!

I must say, my first visit to Gus's wasn't so good.. I'm hearing that was because the owner wasn't in town..  He's back so I decided to give it another try, all SMILES. It was delicious!!

I received my first haircut here as a curly girl!  Terri cut my hair, using the Deva technique ( wedge cut).  Of course I was a bit nervous at first--but after having a short consultation with her before having my hair cut I was totally comfortable.  I loved the results and she even told me to come back if I had any straggly ends.    I love everything about this salon, everyone is friendly, unlike some salons, where you walk in and the shop goes completely silent. LOL.  The owner is awesome too!  THANKS TERRI!

I was the least bit impressed. I made reservations for a private room for a special occasion that was to be held here. As a host, I made sure I arrived about 15-20 minutes earlier just to make sure that the reservations were okay so that we can be seated and my entourage wouldn't have to wait. I was told that they were running about 15 minutes behind schedule so we'd be seated about 15 minutes after our RSVP time. That's fine with me, but the wait turned out to be 1.5hrs. long TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. We ended up having to be seated at two separate tables in the regular dining area. Complete disaster. The waitress was a wreck. The sushi was not the absolute best, I cant imagine trying this place again anytime soon. A complete disappointment.

I had the best time at Fez for my pre 21st birthday!  Complimentary almond brownie with ice cream! And Birthday shots for the whole table!  I don't remember the waitress name but she was great!  The food was delicious but I found it odd that the burger that my cousin and bf ordered was $10 and didn't come with fries.. that's $2 extra. But I guess you have to pay the price to get fat, ha!  The food was delicious, interior was nice!  I'll definitely go back!

Guilty pleasure! The cornbread is so good, My bf and I seriously just ordered a bag of cornbread to take to his apt for dinner! LOL  Great customer service, this is one of those places where no matter what you try it's still going to be delicious.

Loved Sprinkles since my first taste back in Calif.  It is surely a guilty pleasure, I don't have them often since the price is a bit high just for a cupcake.  I love the artistry behind everything though!

On the prowl for some good food, Lucky Boy caught my eye, ordered a burger and fries. The burger was good. . . the fries were burnt.  I asked my boyf. if that was how the fries were always cooked? he Had one and was grossed out.  They were dark brown!  I ended up taking the fries back and the owner looked at me like I was in the wrong for bringing them back in exchange for  some not so over cooked fries.    Employees were nice about it, but the owner is a jack-a__

All in all, this is one of my fave spots to go for sushi here in the valley, mostly because of the japanese soda's, Most other places don't have them which sux!    service here is always great, fast seating times even with larger groups.  Sushi is good as well.  No complaints

I am never disappointed!  I've been here several times with the bf. Love the Watermelon-Lemonade.  I usually always get some type of breakfast burrito from here, I always end up cutting it in half and having the rest later in the day.  Very filling, but in a way so that you're not feeling gross and groggy afterwards.

I always receive good service here, went yesterday around lunch time and was seated promptly.  Food came out in a very decent time frame.  2 entrees and an appetizer for only $20 YOU CAN  NOT BEAT IT!  And the food was excellent  Also, there is karaoke until around 2am, I'm not sure exactly what nights besides Friday's and Saturdays, but it's always entertaining!  Check the location out for sure :)

Okay, as much as I love Starbucks Coffee. . . This gives them a run for their money for sure!    The interior decor is nice, very relaxing.  The baristas were friendly and what I enjoyed most is the fact that once your drink or food is ready, they don't just scream your name out at the bar, they actually walk it over to you.. whether you're sitting outside or inside!  Amazing.  I wish there was one closer to home, but It was worth the drive  Truly the way coffee is suppose to taste

So the service was good--timing, acceptional since we were in no rush..   Ordered a venti iced coffee & a tall White Mocha (hot)  But she didn't give us a straw for the iced coffee.. and we had driven off before we noticed.  Maybe she was a new barista because she seemed a bit nervous

So I finally checked it out over the weekend, great customer service. One of the associates took the time to tell me all about yoga and the classes that they have. Leaned something new, Not only are there yoga classes on Sundays in the park, but there are also other classes available Monday and Tuesday ( not Yoga ) I think it is amazing for them to do such a courtesy!    I've only tried yoga once in my life time, it was some kind of sweat box yoga, which I felt like I was dying!  I'm excited to check out yoga in the park!

Personal Banker Bettyanne is awesome, she always follows up and is very easy going.   Each time I have gone to this bank it doesn't seem very busy, I'm guessing since it is fairly new, furthermore.. great customer service, I'm happy!

I was not greeted until I was about to leave out of the store, the lady ( said she was the owner ) at the register clearly saw me, as I was looking at some tanks right by the register, she said NOTHING until I was about to head out, that's when she wanted to ask if I was looking for anything in particular.  I actually wasn't I just wanted to see what they had to offer, being that it was my first time in the boutique.  I asked if she was the owner and she proudly stated that she is, and that she has another location as well.    Even if I would have received good customer service, this definitely isn't a store that I'd be out on the prowl for, the items seem a tad bit chintzy and out dated

Decided to have dinner here on Friday, Received the best customer service I've received in a while!  Jane was our waitress, she was soooo awesome, made sure we liked our food and drinks, was willing to let us exchange if we didn't like it.  We were also able to get complimentary samples of drinks!  Great time, when I go back I defintely hope Jane is there!

Love the new City Scape UO! love the fact that I don't have to drive to tempe or scottsdale for it!    Associates were really nice, were a great help and gave me space.  You know how some stores you go into, and the associates act so desperate to make a sale, so they're constantly on you about items!  Not here, customer service was great.  The only thing this UO needed was the APT decor section, :(  that would have totally made it a 5*'er

One of my favorite places in Tempe, I get really good vibes here, all of the staff are friendly and the owner is great!  You can order anything off the menu and pretty much be amazed by it.  I am upset for 1 reason though, after having a vanilla latte here I can no longer enjoy a latte from other places, it isn't the same!  I wish I lived a bit closer to Crepe bar, but when I go it is always a great treat!  I recently had a meet-up here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9xB1WzwJTE  Thank you for your superb customer service :)

I enjoy the shrimp protein bowl with the forbidden rice, they have THE best sangria that I have ever had-- the red is delicious but I'm a sucker for the white sangria. Amazing atmosphere, a great place to catch your zen.
