Excellent company to do business with.  They are friendly and honest.  I have been doing business with them for 12 years now and they have always done right by me.

If you are looking for a reliable, professional company to service your pool...  This isn't it.  On Wednesday I went to back wash my pool filter and realized that no matter what I did, the pump wouldn't prime.  I figured I either had an air leak or my pump was clogged.  So the next day (Thursday) at 9:00 am I called Chemdyne to come out and repair my pool.  The person who answered the call said, "Our technician will either be out  today or if he can't make it today, definitely tomorrow (Friday).  I said, "Great, because my chlorine is low, it's hot out and my pool will start to turn green soon."  Well nobody showed up on Thursday so I knew he would be there on Friday and took the day off from work so I could make sure I was home when he arrived.  Around noon time on Friday, I called and asked if they had a better idea of what time the technician would get here.  He replied, "No, I don't know which technician has your job".  So I said, "why don't you call them to find out."  He said he would try but that they don't usually look at their cell phones.  I never heard back.  So around 3:00 pm, I drove down to the store to find out what was going on.  I got the same responses. basically an "I know nothing" that would make Sargent Shultz proud.   Well "are they even going to show up today?" I asked..  Yes, they should, your job is on the schedule...  But if not, It will be first thing tomorrow (Saturday)...  If not???  Well how did we get out to Saturday now?  And I will have taken an entire day off of work for nothing?  Whatever...  Friday 7:00 pm..  nothing, not even a phone call.  It's now Saturday at 4:20 pm...  Still nothing... not even a phone call.  Never again...  Oh and by the way,  I'll be buying all my pool supplies at Paul's Ace and Leslie's now.

This is a great hardware store.  I can't count how many times they have bailed me out when I need some fasteners, a tool or some building materials right now.   Not only are they a thriving business, but they go out of their way to support and be part of our community.  They are definitely a big asset to our town.

This really is a "Dive bar".  Although I met some greatpeople there that seemed to like the place.  Surveying the surroundings I ordered a beer and was surprised to be charged $4 for a draft.  This is a $2 a beer kind of place, not a $4 kind of place.  I asked if they had any "happy hour" specials and the bartender told me that $4 was the happy hour special!   So... although this place isn't horrible,  I think you'll do a lot better at either the Saddle Bronc Grill or the All American (formerly Overtime Cafe).

Derek @ Exklusiv Motorsports is the best VW guy in the Valley.   He knows these cars inside and out and is one of the only guys in the Valley that really knows the TDI's.  His prices are extremely reasonable and he is very honest about what needs (or doesn't need) to be done to your car.  Derek has been doing all the work on my 01 Jetta for the last 11 years and I have always been very happy with his service.  From routine oil changes, to power upgrades to complete engine rebuilds, Derek is the guy to see for your VW.  He is not the easiest guy to get ahold of but his work, honesty and pricing are absolutely worth dealing with that small difficulty.

My experience was a little different here.  First of all the parking lot was empty, usually a bad sign.  When we entered the resturant, we were the only ones in there.  The two guys working there were friendly enough and the prices were fantastic.  But the food didn't taste quite right.  Something tasted a little off in both my dinner and my wifes.  Almost like the oil they were cooking with was too old.   And the fact that they charge for refills on the soda (after the first free refill, but it's a small cup) was a little offputting.  The price is right but the food could certainly be better.

I called VIP Smart Storage to get a price on an epoxy garage floor.  Gene Miller came out when he said he would, measured up the floor, showed me some samples and explained the process to me.  VIP wasn't the cheapest, but they were using the best quality materials (from what I have researched) so I signed the contract.  When the day came to start the install Mike showed up (again, on time) to do the install.  This guy is fantastic.  He did a lot of work (hard work) to properly prep the floor for the epoxy coating (grinding, patching, replacing expansion joint board, caulking etc..) and he did it all correctly.  Every step of the way, he paid great attention to detail.  Mike is a true professional and if he is doing your floor, you can take it to the bank that the job is going to be done correctly.  I would definitely recommend VIP.

This place is not very good.  We bought tickets to see John Pinette for $22.00 each which seemed to be a fantastic bargain.   Believe me, they intended to make up for it!  The seating is terrible.  The only other time I have been that crowded together is on an airplane (literally).  For appetizers, we ordered the cheese plate ($12) and chicken strips ($10).  The cheese plate came out and it looked like somebody tossed a couple of tablespoons of feta cheese on a plate with some crackers.  That was it!  I wouldn't have paid $1.50 for that crap...  The 5 chicken strips were mediocre but at $10, in a comedy club, I can live with it.  We ordered the scallop dinners at $25 a pop and was shocked to find the dinner consisted of 5 tiny scallops and a few very small shrimp.  Total ripoff.  And none of this food was very good.  What was even a bigger ripoff was the outrageous drink prices.  You won't know it until you get the bill because the drink prices are not on the menu.  A Long Island ice tea with Bacardi cost $15 each!  And there is a 2 drink min per person.  The drinks are very likely to cost you a lot more than you paid for the tickets to the event.  The service is mediocre at best.  When we asked for a couple of glasses of water, the waitress told us that she was taking drink orders now and didn't have time to get us any water.  I guess you can do that when the tip is automatically added onto the bill.  Our tickets cost $44 for my wife and myself.  Our dinner / drinks bill was $240!  That all said, John Pinette made it worth it.  He put on a great show.  Next time I see him, I hope it is in a better place.

This place is great.  I'm glad to finally see a decent frozen yogurt shop in Fountain Hills.   The yogurt is awesome and the prices are reasonable.  We used to travel over the hill to Scottsdale to buy frozen yogurt at Yogurtology but Oyo is every bit as good and even slightly better in price.

Finding a roofer that is as honest, hard working and talented as Darren of Incredible Roofs is a rare find.  Darren's work is impeccable.  This guy understands quality and a job done right.  His prices are also extremely reasonable.  (How do you find that combination anymore???)  He completely re-roofed my  Fountain Hills home over a year ago.  The job was perfect.   I am very happy I went with Incredible Roofs.
