I have been twice and both times have been treated like family. I loved how intimate it felt and how the staff treated us so great. I really enjoyed the garlic bread and tortellini. My husband was truly impressed with the baked ziti. You can tell that the pasta is homemade and it is always great when the staff is knowledgeable about the menu.   My mother in law loved the music choice. Thanks again for the great time!

When I first moved to Surprise from Scottsdale I struggled to find a regular nail shop. I tried 2 other local locations and they were bad. I tried this location and it was great.   They are clean, they are professional and most of all it seems they are ahead of the game.   I really enjoy the deluxe pedicures with the paraphin wax as well as the include hot stone massage. I usually see Ivy for my gel nails and she does a great job.  Another added bonus is the typically are very quick to get you in and out. I also like that you can make appointments.   If you are ever in the area and need your nails done this is a must try location and I am sure you will be completely satisfied.

Avoid this place if possible. I went there and my nails were done terribly and I basically had to go get them fixed within a week or so. It is also pretty dirty, if you have the option to avoid, I would do so.

The food is okay. It's not the worst I have had or the best but the reason for the 1 star is the rudeness you have to experience when eating there. The lady at the front counter is rude and often talks down to you, if you don't know the menu or what you want. The last time I went the service was extremely slow and no one ever really checked on you. I would say avoid unless you enjoy rudeness, and slow service for subpar food.

Let me start with I have been here twice (and I really didn't want to write this negative review).   I was very excited when I saw Longhorn was coming to the area. I have been severely disappointed each time. The service is by far the worst and at one point we had to ask for our salads. The first time we went, the kitchen messed up our order (at least that's what the manager told us after we waited nearly 40 minutes and then after that it took another 20 minutes to get our food).   Tonight my steak was so over cooked. We waited so long, she offered another but I just said no. They wound up comping my meal. I must have noticed at least 4 others in the same boat. I like LongHorn.   I hope they get it figured out.

Really enjoyed the breakfast sandwich and the ice tea. Overall the price was worth it and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I would definitely come back and try the all you can eat French Toast.

I really enjoyed the grilled pickles and the BLT Sandwich. I would avoid the fried green tomato (with my sandwich which had avocado it became mushy). We also had the chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken which was very enjoyable. The chili was pretty good. Overall it was a good dining experience and we will be back again for sure.
