I love getting adjustment from Dr. Macri.  she takes the time to work the tightness out of my back first.  I have been to other Chiropactors and they just jolt my back and force it into alinement...then I am in more pain.  After Dr. Macri adjustments I ALWAYS feel better.  I brought my boyfriend (who hates doctors) after his session he said he would go back to her and he felt she was so knowledgable and he completely trusted her.  I highly recommend Macri Wellness Center

If I could give this place a negative star I would.  Dr. Parvo made me feel horrible told me over and over my dog was going to die ( he is happy and healthy today) My sister took her dog there and found out she had cancer...the same vet told her to have risky surgery to remove the cancer and if she did not have the surgery their nothing they could do.  She decided not to do it...the vet never called or checked in see how the dog was doing.  Her dog got really sick and decided to take her dog to another vet to put her down this vet was shocked. He would have never recommended surgery and the dog would not survive that type of surgery. He gave my sister some help and she able to safely extend her pups life for an another season.  My niece bought her dog to this vets with a minor injury they milked her out of hundreds of dollars and the dog has never healed properly to this day  I think the staff was great that the only nice thing I could say nice about this vets office

I love this park always something fun going on.  I love the ponds and I like sit by the waterfalls and think.  My dogs love going there with me and they love to check out the ducks.  One of my favorite places in Gilbert

Dawson is amazing.  I have tons of anxiety around doing my taxes.  He calmed me down and relaxed me.  He made the whole process easy and stress free.  So happy I found Queen Creek Accounting.  I own a small business and now I have one less thing to worry about...Thanks Dawson, your an angel

If I can give this place 10 stars I would it's the best Asian/seafood buffet ever. The lamb skewers are amazing.  They have a chocolate fountain. Enough said :)
