We went to the bar and our bartender was one of the best servers I have ever experienced. He was very attentive and friendly. Shrimp tacos where delish, cod in the grilled fish tacos not as good. Atmosphere was fun and friendly and festive. I will definitely be back.

Went to get a Christmas tree last night. We walked up at 8:40. I know they close at 9, but we are quick. When we got to gardening they told us they where trying to close and when my husband asked what time they closed, they said 8. Kind of unprofessional to lie about closing time especially when you can just check online. We would have been out the door before 9. We have crazy hours and this was the only time we could do this together. I always bought my trees here, but if they don't want my business, I will go elsewhere.

Good food, mostly burgers, but the pork, cheese, fries goodness was delish. Salad was huge for $6. I tried the porter and was very happy with my choice. Cute with the charm 4 peaks used to have back in the day. I will definitely be back, this is my new favorite place.
