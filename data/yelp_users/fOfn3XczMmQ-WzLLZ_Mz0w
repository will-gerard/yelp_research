Nice sports bar. Love the burger and wings. The people behind the bar (including the cook) are always nice. Great place to catch a game. I do wish they would have live music. It seems like it could be an awesome venue.

Great place for a show. Great place to drink. Very cool staff and the overall vibe is nice. Only problem is that the A/C doesn't seem to be a priority there.  :) Go.

Great service. Good food. I ordered something a little off the menu.  I had the chile relleno but had them add the carne adobada instead of the regular shredded beef. Turned out to be a great choice. I think this may be my go to place for day drinking. They have a full bar. My birthday is on Saturday so it might be a great place to start the day.   Go!

Best pasta I've ever had at a restaurant. Service was too slow otherwise it would have 5 stars. Go!

It's a sports bar type of place. The service has always been good to me here.  :) Food is standard for a bar but pretty good. Try the wings. On karaoke night there is this older gentleman who belts out all your favorite grunge tunes from the 90's. I don't like karaoke but this is a treat, hahaha

Delicious! FYI: it moved to 1003 E. Indian School Rd. I had the spicy red chili beef taco and it was awesome! The ordering part is a little unorganized but I assume they are still working out the kinks. This place really isn't for the healthy. :) Go!

Great food. Great service. Great price. I had the Tacos Don Chuy plate. Two carne asada tacos with beans (de la hoya), rice and guacamole. Not rocket science but well served and delicious. Good salsa too. Go.

Very cool bar on a Sunday. $3 beer specials and pretty ladies hanging out. I did not partake of the food this time so no opinion on that. I'll be back some day.

No french fries: strike one Waitresses are pretty but really slow; not rude but indifferent. They decided to clean the floor around us with a huge amount of bleach: gross fumes :( My torta de pierna was delicious but not so much so that it makes me want to come back. Sorry. I just had a bad enough experience to not want to come back.

First time ordering today.  Got the Chicago style 14" Classic Combo and it was delicious. Probably my favorite pizza in the Phoenix area so far. I'm going back soon. Go.

There are some businesses you really want to root for and hope they do well. Los Taquitos is one of those businesses for me.  The best thing about this location is the pretty ladies that work there.  :)  I've been here twice to lackluster dining experiences.  Today I ordered the special which was a chimichanga and drink for $6.99. Not bad except for the fact I got the wrong chimichanga. I got chicken instead the beef chimichanga I ordered.  I also ordered the rolled tacos which is an order of 3 taquitos for $5.25.  If the food were of gourmet quality I could easily see paying that but for the quality, the amount served should be twice that.  The rolled tacos are OK just way over-priced.  I'd really like to give this place one more try which is something that I never due after two really mediocre experiences.  They do serve beer and wine so it might just be a nice place to relax and have some chips and salsa.  I've only been during lunch when I'm the only person in the restaurant. Maybe the cool crowd hangs here during the evenings. Who knows?  We'll see.

[Edit] I'm downgrading this establishment after the bullsh!t I went through today. I've been frequenting this place on a regular basis. I love the tacos. However, as I stated, they charge .50 cents per credit card transaction (which is already a bunch of bull). I placed my order and saw they had fresh pineapple juice. I asked to add that to my order but instead of adding the juice to my order she charged me two different transactions on my card! I told her it was a bad move but she didn't care and gave me some BS about the cost and blah, blah, blah. Taking cards is the cost of doing business. Don't think I'll be going back. Sucks because they do make good tacos but I'm a stickler for service and fairness.

A lot of beer on tap. A lot of cover bands. Not a lot of blues. A lot of pretty bartenders with big...smiles Not a lot of alcohol in the drinks. Meh. I prefer to get drunk and listen to music elsewhere.
