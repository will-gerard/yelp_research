I had St. Francis recommended to me several times before I ended up going.  Don't wait, go to St. Francis, it is worth your time and money.  St. Francis is good from top to bottom, side to side.  The ambience is wonderful and really fits the Phoenix location well.  Everything I have eaten here is excellent.  My personal top three are the Moroccan Meatballs, the Fingerling Potatoes, and the Pig Dip.  They are all three dishes that really show what St. Francis is all about and the quality of food they create.  All food is seasonal and prepared by intelligent professionals that are truly passionate about food.  Check out their happy hour and Market in Downtown Phoenix too.  Don't miss St. Francis!

I wish I could give 0 stars.  24 Carrots is a nightmare from the second you walk in.  Look anywhere and you will see filth; from the half-inch of dust on the fan blades to the garbage scraps covering the kitchen floor to the apartment-sized electric griddle where all food is cooked to the single spatula that is scraped on the griddle and then laid straight on a table in a pile of food carnage.  Aside from all of this, the person who helped us did not know the menu and used his computer 4 times as a reference while making our juice.  Understaffed, inefficient, dirty, poorly managed, slow:  just don't go here for your own health and sanity.  Literally, I thought I was on a prank show and could not believe what was happening was actually happening.

The Parlor is fantastic.  This restaurant is run by professional, well-trained chefs and business owners and it is clear from every aspect of the restaurant.  There are lots of places for good pizza but not many are quite as good as The Parlor.  Every pizza I've had is great; choose one the suits your topping preferences.  The Cubano is one of the best sandwiches of all time and the Roasted Banana Ice Cream will change what you think about frozen treats.  No matter what you get, you'll be getting meal made of responsibly sourced, local ingredients prepared simply with a lot of integrity.  Keep in up Parlor!

The chips and salsa here are great.  The salsa is homemade and you can taste it.  Second, the atmosphere and location are casual and convenient.  That's the end of the positives.  As for the rest of the food, the carne asada tacos were made with "home made" tortillas that tasted 3 days old and meat that was cooked 3 times as long as necessary.  It was like beef jerky wrapped in a dry corn husk.  The mojito was incredibly weak and had not a hint of rum.  The pastor sandwich was ok but forgettable.   The management was worst of all.  We were told by our server upon arrival that it was happy hour and beers were half off.  When we received our bill, beers were full price.  When the server was confronted he apologized and spoke with the manager; he returned to us saying there was nothing he could do and he fought for us.  The manager never stopped by the table or said a word to our table about the miscommunication.  Whoever the manager was today should be fired and ashamed for being a coward; you're an embarrassment.  Bottom Line:  do not go here.  Take your money and go anywhere else.

Everyone should work with Chris.  While that would make him quite busy, every client would be better off and happier for it.  My wife and I have worked with him three times.  What sets Chris apart is his consistent commitment to his client.  Chris is focused on the client and their wishes from the initial meeting all the way through the signing of the paperwork (he will sit with you and explain every page of it too, if you wish).  Chris has truly mastered his craft and you would be hurting yourself to use anyone else.
