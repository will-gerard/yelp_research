Stopped at Sam's for a work lunch. Great location. It's good to have places like this downtown.   Everyone in our group enjoyed the food. From the variety of pre-meal chips, the entrees, and the post meal white chocolate tamales.   I had the shrimp tacos an they were great. Fresh, rich with flavor, and very filling.  I'd like to stop in after work some time for some margaritas.

The George is always a good time..  Drinks are reasonable, food is good.  The sports selection last night was atrocious, but I am not ready to blame the George for that.  Trivia is fun on Thursdays, but sometimes a bit tough to hear..  Staff was friendly and responsive.  Never had to wait long for a drink.  Go when there are good sports on for the rowdy atmosphere, especially if you like football (soccer)

So, I decided to check out this place upon reading AMber W.'s review.  Just as advertised.  Cool dive bar.  Be ready for a diverse taste in music, but i swear, this place has one of the best digital juke boxes I have seen!  I was at G & D last week, and 4 Kings must have 2-3 times as many songs available.  Good prices..  Love when a bartender takes the time to exchange names..  Even if I forgot..  I am bad with names!  Anyways, huge patio out back..  Pool tables, Harley Davidson pinball is fun..  Everyone seemed  nice enough..  No drama from the locals..  Stop in, have a cheep beer.  Watch some cash cab on the TV and play some tunes..

How have I not been here before?  Finally stopped in and oh my, delicious!  My son had a bean burrito. He loved it. I had a bite and the beans are great!  I tried the Mexican taco. This is a must try!  You probably only need one. Especially I you have the chips and salsa. Quite simply the best taco I ever had.   Service was a bit slow, even though they weren't busy, but not enough to keep me from reccomending or returning.   Â¡El Bravo es muy bien!

Checked out Joe's for some live music.  I have been here quite a few times, but not recently.  What a change!  Much more room around the stage since the games got moved to the new space.  Stage seems bigger, but maybe it's just me.  With the loss of Blooze, I am sure I'll be back here more often.  Best place in the area for live music and reasonably priced drinks.

Had Carolina's for lunch yesterday.  Just happened to be downtown with some clients I am consulting for.  Got the beef enchilada combo.  The food was great as always.  I usually go for the burros, although I rarely get through a foot long (who could?).  My colleagues got cheese enchiladas and chicken tacos.  Everyone was very happy with the food, and we all left stuffed.  They even paid!  The only thing better then lunch at Carolina's is a free lunch at Carolina's.

4 stars just because how could I give Taco Bell 5??  To start, I am biased towards food wrapped in a tortilla..  I love it..  Put pizza or ice cream in a tortilla, and it is just that much better.  Short of the extreme of the Taco Time SNL sketch (google it), wrap my meal in a tortilla to go!  Ok, as for Taco Bell, for the most part you know what you are going to get.  While I have had a few 7-layer burritos that were "off" in the past, for the most part, there is little surprise.  I just want to commend this particular location because it is probably the busiest Taco Bell I have ever seen.  Any day M-F and this place is a mad house at lunch time.  Thankfully, they are super fast on servicing both the "Here" and "To Go" orders..    That's it..  4 starts for a Taco Bell that delivers the highest quality of crap fast food mexican at the fastest pace!

Just an update..  This Taco Bell is still the best..  I mean, as far as Taco Bell goes..  Tortillas were very soft and fresh, almost like they were bought locally..  The staff was very friendly.  My order was done quickly, and everything tasted as good as taco bell can make it..

Got to (or had to) spend 4 hours here today..  My hand grips were literally melting off my v-rod..  So, I went to see if they had them replacements, and they did.  Common part, so not a huge surprise.  Then, I asked if they could order a rubber pad for one of my footpegs..  They actually had it in stock!  This is not a part many shops would have on hand.    So, after purchasing, I inquired about the install process.  Didn't sound that complicated, but decided to have it done at the service dept.  30 minutes install wasn't bad, it was just waiting an hour for a tech that was the problem..  But, I didn't call ahead or anything, so not their fault..  The waiting area had a big screen, comfy chairs, free water, and a pool table.  All I needed was a brew..  Bike done, they rolled it out.  They even had washed her!  But, alas, the adventure was not over.  Front tire was flat.  They had already filled it and in 5 minutes, it was flat.  So, they rolled it back inside.  Leaky valve stem set me back another 1.5 hours and a C note.  But, better than a wreck if you ask me.  Now, bike is clean, grips are fresh, and tires are pumped up to 38 PSI and holding strong.  Now, if we could just drop the temp about 20 degrees, I'll be all set.

So I went to Carl's after making some changes to my truck's front suspension.  The changes required an alignment.  Called Carl's and they got me right in.  They called about an hour later to say that a loose hub made an alignment impossible.    So, I replaced the hub and took my truck back 2 days later.  Called to check on my truck, and they said 30 minutes.  So I showed up, truck was out front so I went to get keys and pay.  Inside the same tech said that the new hub was a bit wobbly and that I should replace it with a better one.  He also said they got it as straigt as they could, but he wont charge me because it wasn't perfect.  That is the makings of a quality shop folks.  When I get the energy to swap out the hub bearing again, I'll be back for that pesky alignment..

I used to always go to Henry's across the street before it closed.  I loved Henry's..  I don't know if Sprouts has grown on me, or it is just my memory of Henry's slowly fading away...  Regardless, if I was shopping Sprouts, it can mean only one thing..  DIET TIME!  No, not really that excited..  Too many meals out and happy hours (I blame Yelp..  A little..)  I go to Sprouts for the fresh organic veggies, soups and snacks..  I'll be there at least one or two more times in the next two weeks until I return to real food.

4 stars just because I have not tried the food here yet.  This place has one of the best scotch selections in town.  Matt who was the bartender last night was very cool.  Even helped me prank a bartender at Cheurvont.  So funny..    Had a great time, and will most certainly be back..  Also, I will update with a food review once I actually eat there..  :)

My home away from home?  Not quite, but one of my favorite places to ride the Harley to.  Not a traditional biker bar (steel horse saloon and Hardtailz are btoh very close) but they are biker friendly.  This is a small place with a few pool tables, some pinball, and a decent jukebox.  I made it a regular spot because by my third visit, Andrea the bartender already knew my order.  I know the names of some locals, and everyone is laid back.  No attitude.  No food here, but they order from the pizza place next door and bring your food over to the bar.  If you like small occasionally loud dive bars, check it out.   Oh, and I challenge you to beat my 67 million score on the Adams Family pinball machine!

Can't go 5 starts cause I only ate there once..  Today I had the pleasure of trying their Pollo Fundido..  Mmmmmmmmmmm..  I am a big fan of Some Burros in Tempe.  This was easily as good or better.  Loaded with sauce, and the burro was fried just the perfect amount.  Next time, I am going to try their fajita burro and maybe eat in with one of the many beers they sell.

I LOVE this place..  This is my sushi bar.  Danny, one of the two sushi chef's is awesome.  I have always found their sushi to be very fresh.  About a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu.  With rolls like these: Dirty Harry, Mr. Miagi, Rio, you cannot go wrong.  Especially if you like spicy (like me)!  Even the non-sushi is great.  This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesn't have a drive through window.  Also, $4.50 sake bombs!!!  $4.50!  Go here.  Try it.  Don't be scared off by a couple of so-so (ok, 1 bad) reviews.  I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future!  Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled.  Almost forgot!  They have some big screen TV's!  Watch sports here!  They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football..    Just go.  Now..  Seriously.  Review part is over..  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here.  You could be finding your keys..  Putting on socks and shoes..  Hell, skip the socks..  Wear sandals.  Save time.

Wanted to eat at a fancy place, but no time on a Saturday night.  Was disappointing to end up here with mediocre food and service.  We were warned about karaoke night, but the singers were ok, so it was tolerable.   Good place for lunch maybe, but not on a date..  At least not inside.  Maybe on a cooler night on the patio.

Rode the ol' Harley here as part of some east side bar hopping on Wednesday..  This was stop number...  Umm..  I forget..   Anyways..  Tried some new beer.  Always fun to experiment, and no better place to do it.  Played a ton of songs on the jukebox, and bribed the staff to stay open long enough to hear all of them (not past 2:00 or anything..  Don't want to get anyone in trouble..)  Had a blast.  Will be back..  In like 2 hours..  :)

just returned from the Jungle.  Solid as always.  Busy too.    Today I started with a cup of the Turkish Lentil soup.  It was OK.  A bit bland, but hey, it is lentil soup.  The main dish was the cilantro and jalapeno hummus with Taboule salad.  The hummus was great, and the Taboule salad was soooo much better than what I got a Sprouts last week.  The only real knock was how long my food took.  It had to have been about 15 minutes to get the main dish.  The people next to me seemed to get theirs in about 5.  But, it was worth waiting for and Cristina the server was very nice.  I'll see you soon Pita Jungle.

Another day, another lunch in Tempe with a coworker.  Never eaten here until today, after almost 9 years in the area.  How does that happen?  Maybe because there are about 50 sandwich shops in 4 square miles.  Regardless, needed a quick bite and was worried that other places were too busy.  Meatball sub was tasty.  Homemade sauce and meatballs.  Cashier (owner?) was friendly and quick to answer any questions about the menu and favorites..  Give it a try.  I'll go back for the cheese steak soon.

Two words: Pollo Fundido.  Wear your fat jeans or sweats and go eat one.  Then go home and take a shower, unless you like to smell of grease..  Love this place.  Never disappoints. .   If the line is long, call the take out line and order while you wait.  Your food will probably be ready by the time you get to the counter..

I had the cajun last week with a giant 34oz cider..  The food was awesome.  Pasties are typically pre-made, although by pre, I think they mean within the last 20-30 minutes..  Mine was fresh out of the oven.  So delicious.  Never eaten anything like it.  The service was great, everyone was very friendly.  I sat at the bar, so I got to watch the chef's preparing the next batch.  Be sure to tip those guys too.   I'll be back soon, with company.  I have a few more pasties to try..

Great place to stop in for happy hour.  They have a great selection of items at 50% off.  Most of the rolls were very good.  Some were iffy, but not because of the quality.  The ingredients were listed, so if one was too citrus-y, I should have anticipated..  I would and likely will return.  Service was great.  Greeted at the door with a hand shake, seated quickly, and our server was attentive.

So there name on Yelp is a bit behind the times as they are now Monte Vista $2.25 Cleaners..  Still, at $2.25, I find them to be the best place in the area.  You can't beat the price, and no matter what I drop off, shirts or pants to be laundered or dry cleaned, I always know it will be $2.25.  I hate places where some shirts are $1.50 and some are $4 but you don't know until you get the bill.  Same day service is available for dry cleaning which comes in handy if you are like me and wait until you are out of clothes before you drop things off..

How to start.  Subway appears to be an up and comer in the sandwich prepared right in front of your face category.  The premise is simple enough, pick what ingredients you would like on your sub, and they will assemble it, right in front of your face.  The assembly line, in an obvious homage to the great Henry Ford, appears split into 3 sections.  Starting with bread selection, they have at least 5 or 6 types, all available in both 6" and 12" forms (I did not measure to confirm, so I will have to assume they cut mine properly.)  The same person was responsible for meat/cheese, although in busier times, the meat/cheese role could be done independently I imagine.  After selecting to have my sub toasted (30 seconds!) I was passed on, without introduction, to the veggie guy.  I selected lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, olives, bell peppers, and onions.  Each was applied in order, with attention to detail.  This guy was a pro, a real Sandwich Artist (Subway, contact me about using this phrase..)  Finally, a touch of salt, pepper, and red wine vinaigrette.   Onto station #3.  Payment.  My sandwich was hastily wrapped and bagged, and with little reluctance, I added chips and a drink to complete my order.  It all rang up to a mere $6.48.  For something made fresh, it was quite a value meal.  I would not be surprised to see 5000-6000 of these places pop up all over the country in the next few years.  Airports, ball parks, gas stations.  They will be all over.  Give it a try now before the rest of the world finds out.

Ahh tortas..  Had my first taste when I worked in Downtown LA.  The ones here are even better.  This was my first visit in about 6 months.  Forgot how good they are.  I had the Carne which is always a solid choice.  I took a co-worker who was a bit reluctant at first, but seemed to really enjoy the spicy pork.  Also, they have a munch of flavors of horchata, and Coca Cola with real sugar.

Went here for PJ's - Breakfast for dinner night.  I like this place.  I was glad to have a good excuse to visit.  Hang out with friends, help those in need, eat some good food.  I went pretty plain on the Denver omelette..  I may have tried the chorizo, but I had hit my chorizo quota for the week already..   The place is clean.  Servers are friendly.  They have funny quotes on the walls (love the Steven Wright one...)  I will return..  Maybe even for actual breakfast.

What a great place to eat.  It appears to be a two man shop.  Duma, the owner, greats you (and everyone else) and as he says, makes a customer for life.  The food was fantastic, I had the shrimp Po Boy, and it was amazing.  I plan on reeling in a few co-workers for the next visit.  I have been to another Phoenix spot, Baby Kay's on Camelback (probably owe them a review) and the food here is top notch and on par with what you'll find anywhere.  If you want some authentic Louisiana cuisine, this is the place to go.

Still great.  I have been dragging co-workers there left and right.  Everyone loves the food.  Duma is a great host.  Be prepared to smell like grease when you leave though..  But the food is worth it.  The Jerk Chicken Po Boy is good, but the shrimp is hands down my favorite.

Lunched here Monday.  Had read all of the reviews, so expectations were high.  And they lived up to them..  About the place.  Family run, mother/daughter combo.  The son handles the web site and Twitter posts (check Twitter for daily specials).  They were very nice.  The mom kept bringing me food I didn't even order, just because I told her I would eventually try it.  The food:  I ordered a 3 item combo.  I was really only hungry enough for a 2 item, but for the sake of all of you, got the 3 so I could taste one more dish.  The chicken adabo was very simple and good.  Won't overwhelm you with flavor.  It is prepared using chicken wings, and they were hot and tender.  The spicy orange beef was very good.  Daily special I believe.  Very flavorful, with a hint of orange and red peppers.  Also tried the beef mechado, which I am told is one of their better burritos.  The potatoes that accompanied this surprised me.  I expected them to be a bit mushy, but they were perfectly crisp.  I chose mexican rice to go with it, but I believe they have garlic and white rice as alternatives.  They also gave me some of the cassava cake.  I am not a huge fan of coconut, but I tried and enjoyed it.  Also, they brought out a small sampling of their most popular item, the pork egg rolls.  They were almost like deep fried taquitos with a very unique flavor.  Served with sweet and sour, it is a MUST have!  They supposedly have to make 3,000 PER DAY!  Go try it out.  No soda fountain, so you can get canned soda and drinks.  Eat in (cute decor) or take it to go.  Not great for large groups, but 2 or 3 would be OK..

So while I did not get all of my tattoos at Lady Luck, they were all done by the owner Heather.  She is awesome.  She knows what she is doing.  Bring in art work, pick something from one of the many books on site, or ask her to draw something.  You know a good artist has standards.  heather isn't the type of artist that will tattoo "your mom" on some drunk frat guy's ass.  She won't give you your first tat on your neck or hands if you are some 18 year old that hasn't considered what that will mean professionally.  She also doesn't charge for touch ups.  Those are things to look for in an artist.  Now I have not had the pleasure of getting inked by her other artists, but if she hired them, then she trusts them and I would too.  So if you are unsure about your first, want to cover up some old flames name, or just want someone new, give them a call..  Check out the site..  Look at the work and get some ink!

Had lunch will a fellow yelper here..  From the broken ATM to the dry, bland chicken, I'd have a hard time recommending this place.  I may give it a second chance because I want it to be good, but there are plenty of good mexican places nearby..

Erin's is great..  An under-appreciated spot.  Big clean bar with good prices and good people..  Pool tables, darts, lots of TV's, plenty of seats and a decent jukebox.  Stop in and check it out..  Get a $1.50 PBR while you're at it.  Biker friendly!

High hopes. Fading fast.  Small, more community style bank.  I had a good experience mostly, but they have been inconsistent between me and another new customer.  Different answers, delivery dates, and I still have not received my referral credit.

I enjoyed the food from this place.  As people have mentioned, it is kind of a standard walk through burrito joint..  Food was fresh and tasty.  Very filling..  I'd go back.

Stopped in for dinner last week.  They were out of the daily special, Sangria, so we settled on a half price bottle of wine.  We tried the asian short ribs for our appetizer, and had the carne asada potato for dinner.  The food was great!  The service was decent, but I think it suffered a bit as they were training a new employee.  We inquired as to the availability of bacon vodka.  They had none, but had experimented with some bacon flavored jim beam.  Which the bartender shared a bit of.   I like the new spot.  My girl and I will be back!

How have I not been here before?  After 10 years down the road, I finally checked it out.  What a treat.  Great food!  Try the double chicago dog and get some fresh cut fries!

Great place to see a show.  Prices are the best around, and it's never too crowded.

Awesome dive bar. Recently opened and turned what was a quiet place into a thriving fun bar. Go see the girls all dressed up, play poker or pool, and enjoy some great drink specials.

What a find!  This place is fantastic.  Michael is honest and timely, two things you don't always find in this field.  As a bonus, their prices are very competitive, coming in as the best of the three companies that sent quotes.  Michael was out within a few days of my request for a quote.  Unit is on the roof so I didn't need to be there.  Quote was turned around very quickly.  Once I chose Controlled Comfort, the wheels moved right along.  The unit was ordered only requiring a deposit until the install was done.  The day before the install, I was called as a reminder.  They were right on time, in fact a bit early.  The AC unit followed shortly after while they prepped.  The crane was right on time.  They got the AC in place, and about an hour later, there was cold air blowing.  I was invited on the roof to inspect, and saw what a great job they did.  I could tell they took pride in their work, and there was no mess left behind for me to deal with.  These guys are great.  You won't be disappointed.

Horrible experience. I arrived on a Wednesday night about 5 minutes before the movie was to start. Once seated in a cheap office chair, I placed an order for a diet soda and chips and salsa.   The food was pouring out all movie. Right next to me in fact. I had the displeasure in ending up in the seat next to where the servers stage their food delivery. Nothing like a metal tray of food set up next to you every 10 minutes.   So having never been here, I had no idea how long things take. Finally after 35 minutes, I mention to a server that I was yet to receive my drink or food. 10 minutes later I get a watered down diet Pepsi with about 4 ice cubes in it. I also was assured my chips and salsa were coming right out.   15 minutes pass and still no food. I flagged down a lovely girl who was handling checks. I informed her that after over an hour I no longer cared to get the chips I asked for. I was hungry, especially after an hour of food deliveries. But at this point, who needs $5 chips and salsa.   After paying for me flat, oft delayed soda and exiting the theater, I voiced my displeasure with the manager. Having once worked at the movies as a manager, I expected more than just a "sorry."   Needless to say, this was my first and last visit to this theater.

Great choice for Pho!  I swear the wait staff has been different every trip, and the last guy was horrible..  But everyone else has been great, so I'll write off the last experience as a fluke.

Way overpriced.  Love the decor and ambiance, but Delux prices don't work without top notch burgers.  And $6 fries is just ridiculous.

Food was average at best and a bit pricey.  Owner may be off his rocker..

Great food!  The scallops were cooked perfectly.  I was told the pork tips and filet were excellent too.

If your Facebook page and web page and tv monitors all talk about your no sugar added flavors you should have a no sugar added flavor. We passed a dozen other places to come here. We won't make that mistake again.

Fantastic vibe, food and fun.  Had a large group and everyone loved the drinks and menu items.  We shared lots of apps, had great meals, and enjoyed the games.  Being the one person from AZ in the group, I had to pick the spot for my coworkers, and I am glad i selected Culinary Dropout.  Will return!

Not worth the money at all. Long lines. Disorganized. I could play these "games" at home for a fraction of the cost. Obvious cash grab and a waste of time. "The Money Extortion"

Cool spot with a great location, setup and vibe. However my food came out cold (not cool, but noticeably cold) in the middle and upon being reheated a second time, underwhelmed.  By the time my food came back out, my coworker was done eating. Disappointingly, there was no concession or apology for the mistake. I wasn't even thinking it would be comped, but at least maybe a free drink or something   May or may not be back.
