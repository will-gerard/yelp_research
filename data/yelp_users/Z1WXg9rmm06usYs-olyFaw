Sometimes you pay for convenience and this time was proof of that. This was the first time that I walked in rather than using the drive thru. So glad that I did I was able to finally see this disconnect between what I imagined and what is handed through the window. There were only two people on staff I expected slow service but at least accurate and consistent. Man was I wrong my burrito had cheese that wasn't even melted all the way. I fell in love with the restaurant years ago and maybe it's franchising has led to a more diluted product. Not all California staples can withstand not having that key needed oversight. This will me my last visit to this entire chain. If your hungry in the area there's an In and Out across the street , it's a better use of your time and money.

Really good barbers that take their time give you exactly what you ask for. Save some time and patience by not going on base and coming here instead. Prices are on display and reasonable and the staff is friendly. And the barbers remember your usual cut so you really don't have to remind them or try to reexplain. And the best thing is they remember the order customers by memory so need for numbers or arguing.

Nice little cookie shop with average price. I got the: snickerdoddle,peanut butter cookie and carrot cake cupcake. Everything was tasty and you get in and out of the place quick. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area.

Really nice setting really nice waitress and waiter staff. Valet parking that was very nice addition. We are to be Moroccan meatballs they are very rich so maybe ask for another piece of bread to help break it down. Who was pretty good and reasonably priced portions are big enough that you could share. It's kind of tucked away in a corner so you need to slow down as you're approaching it or you could drive right by it. Overall I would recommend coming here.

Just wasn't up to my expectations. My shrimp fried rice wasn't white and had no eggs in it. My orange chicken wasn't spicy and chicken had mediocre flavor. My general chicken was equally disappointing . I sat down to order to look over the menu and after five minutes the hostess sits by me prompting me to order quicker. Even after my food was brought to me I asked for a hot mustard. He looks at me grabs the bag pulls out the one mustard in the bag, and ask do I need more with a certain amount of contention . Overall I have given up on Arizona Chinese food and it looks like Panda Express or bust should be the monicker .

This was a unpleasant surprise for it to be a staple on thr popular television show with Guy. Me and my coworkers went hear and one one person was pleased with their meal. I had a very poorly breaded chicken fried steak in an attempt to get something hearty. What I was served was lack of flavor and enthusiasm. My bacon was overcooked and when they brought me more that was one second less overcooked. The "brioche " french toast was cut like sandwich bread which took away from the delicate bread that it is. And the Reese pancakes the candy isn't even mixed with the batter. Overall this was a bad experience especially because we were so hungry. I can't recommend if you like seasoned food , or effort that matches the price you pay.

Been here a couple of time and each time has been progressively worst. I would liken it to the same price point as Applebee's but not even the same quality of taste. The biggest draw I would say is the UFC PPV that are worth the trip with their wings which are probably one of their only saving graces.  Even on that note it would only be an idea if BWW was to packed.

One of the worst buffets I have ever been to after eating one plate I had my fill of dissatisfaction. I would never revisit this restaurant if you would even call it that. Food was almost indelible.

Really nice that I discovered after seeing a review from another yelper. I forgot the name of the sandwich I got but my friend got the Philly cheesesteak that was omg good and on some of the best bread you could as for. For the meat to be so juicy the bread was excellently picked out and could stand up to the heat and not fall apart. I did not care for the fries or thr coleslaw but the chef to the time to make it right. I want to go back one day and try there chili cheese burger just cause. Nice place different a local spot that people visit frequently for the renowned buger. Worth checking it out.

I show up and the parking lot is empty. There's three bouncers outside the club they're still advertising it over the radio that the club is apparently pack an extra cover is going to end at 11 o'clock. I got there at 12 o'clock and the club had four people in it. We were girls that were on their way out and a bartender who had not even officially set the bar up because he knew no one was going to frequent this club tonight. The DJ for power 98.3  was still advocating that the club was packed and was living up to expectations that they had set out all week long over the radio. The club has a lot of seating room but it all looks dirty the banister were sticky the floor and the tables are unclean. This place must of had that a grungy is looking for VIP section I have ever seen. Stayed in the club long enough to finish one Red Bull and left and went to Jaguars instead. Save your time and money skip this club by all means.

So I'm just going to be honest overall I just wasn't a fan of the food overall. The atmosphere was nice and had that old school diner feel. So for a place you can sit down and feel comfortable. We ordered two hog dogs and a charbroiled chicken sandwich. The hot dogs were unremarkable. The chicken sandwich was good but the toppings and bread did nothing to aide in the flavor. I ended up pulling the chicken out and eating it by itself. Overall I'm not bashing the place, after leaving here I was already looking forward to my next meal.

Save your time and money and fry your fish at home or make a sandwich.  This is not the solution to you hunger pains I promise you.

Came here basically just for the brownie and dessert. The person with me got the pineapple mojito which was really good and really strong didn't get a chance to try the tacos but would come back here to give them a chance. Apparently another restaurant postino's is right across the street so if you don't like the menu you have you have other restaurants within the facility that you can check out without having to drive to another location.
