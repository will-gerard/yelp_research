We had fantastic service and wonderful food!  The cook was a peach!  Left with our bellies full but wanting to keep eating what was on our plates.

I was referred here by another shoe shop (see previous review).  I dropped off my wedding shoes to get dyed.  $30 and a week later, I couldn't be more happy with how they turned out!

Okay, let's be honest, the only reason I keep coming back is the prices.  Low low low.  For my small family of three, we can eat for less than $20 (not including tip).  I love the cucumber ranch with the fried zucchini.  I always get the cheese steak on wheat.  Great that they have the option to get it on wheat.  My honey and son love the wings.  But that's it about this place.  Service sucks.  Good service is reserved for the regulars at the bar.  We can never get out of here in under an hour.  It's never busy anymore so there is no excuse.  It's very sad.  This place use to be wonderful.  I enjoy being able to go somewhere and watch the game while I eat, but I don't want to be there so long that I can watch most of the game!  Also, the girls dressed in short skirts and tight shirts is getting old.

Yes, the doctor's bedside manner could use some help.  I miss his Nurse Practitioner Maria.  She was wonderful.  But even without her, I still get quality care and the office staff is friendly.    A note to the previous reviewer who was told no children allowed.  I have a weakened immune system.  I have children.  I get sick.  They get sick.  There is no need to spread the germs to people who get sick easily.  I understand that it's not always easy to not take a child to the doctor with you, but you have to remember there are other people that go there that have a very hard time recovering from illnesses brought in by children.  That's nothing against children, I love them.

I love this place!  I have a ritual of going there once a month for last couple of years.  It is near my work, but far from home.  That is probably a good thing, because I would eat here all the time if it were close to home.  The service is excellent.  They know they're regulars and get you in and out quickly.  The food is awesome.  They have sandwiches, salads, and bakery items.  When I go, I have to take a shopping list from my coworkers because we all love it.  The food is a little pricey, but well worth it.  I always get the Capricorno and it is just under $9.  But it is very filling and has a small salad that I sometimes throw onto the sandwich.  The Pistachio muffins are to die for.  And I don't like pistachios!

New Owners!!!  I almost fainted when I walked in and didn't see the usual husband and wife team.  But new owners bring changes.  And some of these are positive!  New hours!!!  Yeah!!!  Now open seven days a week!!!  Yeah!!!  Can you tell I am excited?  I wonder if they will be open in the summer too.  The last owners always went to Italy in the summer so it was closed.  They also changed the tables and a few other small details.  But with new owners come changes and I was so nervous that those changes would be seen in the food.  They weren't!  Still awesome quality, yummy, delicious.  I am beyond thrilled.

My family and I really enjoy eating here.  Where else can you play with your food and not get in trouble?  Don't forget to purchase your doggy bag before you leave the register ($0.50)!  Trust me, you'll need it.    Yummy Asian food that you can make anyway you like!  Make sure to use more meat than you think you have if its your first time.  It is afterall the amazing shrinking meat.  Lots of choices in meat, vegetarian options, noodles, and sauces.  Once your plate is cooked, you can head over to get some rice or ice cream too!  This meal typically last three days for us.  And for $10!  The only reasons it did not get 5 stars from me is it isn't always quick service at the cooking stations and buffet area tends to get messy if not frequently checked on.  But it is a buffet, so I guess that is expected.

My husband and I keep trying to find "the" Mexican place.  This wasn't it.  It was just alright.  Not great.  Not bad.  Not worth it.  The place really needs a few coats of paint and some cleaning up.  I did not enjoy squeezing my salsa out of a dirty ketchup bottle either.

DO NOT COME HERE DURING SCHOOL LUNCH HOURS.  Just a little warning.  Made that mistake one time and won't make it again.  Although, I have to give them credit- the high schoolers get their own line and their food is ready made.  Anyway, My husband thinks this place rocks and doesn't want to get fast food Mexican anywhere else.  He hoards the salsa packets and brings them home and puts them on everything.  Personally, I think it's good, but does leave a little to be desired.  It is greasy.  Very greasy.  I like to get one of three things.  The bean and ground beef tostada, the ground beef burrito or the machacha chicken tacos (not as greasy).  I haven't ventured far from those things though.    The refried beans are the best I have ever had and I have to steal the recipe some day.  The rice is blah.    The service is okay.  The food takes a little while to come out, especially if you go during a rush hour.  The layout leaves something to be desired because the place gets so busy.  Location is awesome.  Always clean.

I finally got to try it and we loved it!    After driving by on several occasions and always seeing a line out the door, we finally stopped.  We went on a Saturday afternoon just before a rush.    The homemade root beer was amazing.  Be prepared if you've never had homemade root beer as it is different.  I had the pulled pork BBQ sandwich (1/4 lb) and two sides (sweet corn and coleslaw).  The corn was actually a little bland.  But the coleslaw was great.  They don't ruin it by adding unnecessary ingredients.  The BBQ sandwich was fabulous.  It doesn't look like a lot of BBQ sauce on it, but it is packed full of flavor.  It was exactly right for my tastes.  The portions were large.  I ate only half of each dish and brought the rest home.  It was just as good the second time around.    My man loved his ribs, pulled beef (I think he got beef) on a GIANT baked potato loaded.  Enormous might be a better fitting word for that potato.  Perhaps they give them steroids.  J/K people.  He believes we have found our permanent home for BBQ.  The atmosphere was great.  Lots to look at while we ate.  Because there is always a line out the door, I thought for sure that this place would be small.  Wrong.  It stretched far back.  I couldn't imagine having to wait in that line!  There is also a great curbside type pick up window on the side of the building.  Wonder what the line is like there?  Never noticed before.  Might try that next time.  Overall a great experience.  I can't wait to try Joe's Farm Grill next!

Still good!  We moved closer to Joe's (not on purpose) and eat here more often now.  My honey gets the HUMONGOUS baked potato loaded with everything including pulled pork and ribs.  I still get the small pulled pork sandwich.  Haven't dared to venture from it for some reason, but I do change my sides everytime and like them.

So this time we ordered in bulk for a backyard wedding rehearsal dinner.  we had ordered the brisket and pulled pork and cole slaw by the pound.  Unfortunately, while we were at the rehearsal, the dog tried ALL of the brisket (and amazingly left the rest untouched) so I can't tell you how it was.  But the rest was great as always!

Have been looking for a good cheese steak since moving out here 5 years ago.  Lot's of people tell me they love Uncle Sam's and don't care what anyone else has to offer.  Check out my review on that.  Anyway.  This place is great.  Great food, great service, decent prices.    I have to be honest, I have only tried it once, but I have been daydreaming about it ever since.  I tend to be a Plain Jane with my subs.  Give me the basics and I'm happy.  So my review is based on meat, cheese, and bread.  Thats all.  Oh and the service which was awesome.  Very friendly, attentive.  I even saw a guy walk in and ask for water.  They gave him a cup for free and he got it from the soda machine.  They have a "back east" atmosphere inside which was like walking into a sub shop back home.  Um and formal attire?  Really?  It's a sub shop people.

We came here as one of the stops on my bachelorette party so my review might be a little off because, well because I was off.  We had reserved a room for karaoke.  It was kinda small, but cozy.  They had a good selection of music.    We had sushi, yummy.  Drinks, lots of yummy Saki.  We were loud and crazy and we could do it all in private!  Now to the creme de le creme.  The toilet.  O.M.G.  Really?  An automatic everything toilet?  Butt warmer, butt cleaner, coochy cleaner, blower.  Holy cow.  I need one of these in my home.   Place was very pricey though.  We had a two hour rental which was over $100.  Plus drinks and tips.  The sushi came with the room.

This was awful.  And now that we have been to Hawaii, it is even worse.  I have only been to Ono once before, many years ago in Scottsdale and don't remember it being this bad.  The service was horrible, the smell was foul, the food was gross.  Overall bad experience.

Wow, for such a small hole in the wall, there are a lot of surprises packed in here.    For starters, don't let the location scare you away.    Don't let the size scare you away.  We were greeted at the door by the owner who patiently held the door open for us as we slowly made our way in.  There were two tables outside with umbrellas and tablecloths.  Inside there were 4-6 two top tables, and about 3 four tops.  Very tiny.  But it turns out, very intimate.    Since my son and I went with my parents, we were seated at a four top.  Clean and well presented.  A small TV hung on the wall with the basketball game on (happened to be Celtics!).  Service was quick.  We placed our orders with our friendly and informative waiter and were served a plate of bread (didn't think to ask what kind as I did not recognize it) with a chunky tomato dressing on the side.  Both were excellent.  Since everything is made fresh, the wait for food was a little long, but not bad.   I ordered the Margarita Pizza, my son order the same with onions on it, my mother ordered the Chicken Parm, my father ordered the Lasagna.  Everyone loved their food.  My parents cleaned their plates.  My son and I had ordered small pizzas which I had assumed were personal sizes.  turns out they were a medium Dominos sized pizza.  So we got yummy leftovers!  While we dinned, the owner approached the table to ask how everything was.  He explained that he was the new owner and was excited to see new faces.  We chatted with him for a while.  He came over several times over the course of the evening and helped get water for our glasses which never went empty.  During our talks my son mentioned that his 11th birthday is on Friday.  The owner later remembered that and told him happy birthday 11 year old!  That was sweet.  We also ordered desert.  My mother ordered the Tiramisu, my father ordered the Creme Brulee, and my son and I split the chocolate cake.  Guess which was the best?  The Creme Brulee!  Sweet and yummy.  The Creme and the cake had a raspberry drizzle on it.  The cake was actually more like a slice of fudge.  The Tiramisu was light and sweet.  All very good.  They also have a Canonli, but we didn't try that.  Oh well.  I really can't find any fault with this place.  Great service, great food, great atmosphere.  I am assuming that the new owner changed the plates.  Everything was served on plain white square or rectangular plates that I like a lot better than the ones in the pictures.  The pasta dishes were served on square plates that were maybe a square foot.  Crazy big!    It was pricey.  I think the total before tip was somewhere around $80 for the four of us.  My pizza was $9.  I have had better, it wasn't bad though, and the overall experience made up for it.  My parents couldn't help but rave about their food, especially the deserts.  I recommend Pizza A Metro, especially for a date!

Ridiculous.    I found them on Craigslist with an ad saying security doors for $188.  Awesome deal.  I check out their website.  It says you can select from the Star Series doors for the $188 price.  I called in the second to last week of March to make an appointment for a quote.  Earliest they said they had available was April 4th.  Make the appointment for 3PM.    The Friday before the appointment, someone calls from their number, but doesn't leave a message and hangs up before I can answer it.  I can only assume that they were either calling to confirm the appointment or change the time.  Pretty sure it was the latter.  Monday rolls around.  No phone calls.  Have a family at the house at 2:30.  There is already a business card on the door that says "Doc" was there and the appointment was at 2-3.  No other details left on the card.  So I call the company.  They said our appointment was 2-3.  I said I was told 3, but why didn't someone call me?  We could've gotten there.  Was never given the opportunity.  So I asked her if he measured.  She asked if he left a quote on the card, I told her no.  She said if he was there, then he measured.  Okay.  Great, so how much.  She said she would have him call me.    Monday ends, no call.  Tuesday at 4:30, I call them back, tell them he still hasn't called.  He just left for the day, so they can't help me.  Why don't you keep your quote on file then?  Anyway, she was nice about it and told me he would definitely call the next day.  4:30 rolls around on Wednesday and he still hasn't called so I call.  She (I think it was a different girl because she was rude from the get go) puts me on hold.  The call hangs up on me so I am now frustrated and call again.  She immediately asks if I can hold, I told her I was hung up on last time I was holding.  She holds me anyway without a word.She finally comes back with a massive attitude (granted I was grumpy at this point, but not rude yet).  Told me the quote was around $864.  I asked her for the breakdown.  She said we needed two parts (threshold and something else that I can't remember for the life of me).  Those two things were $90 something and $60 something.  I asked how $188 + 90 + 60 = $864???  She then tells me that we chose the Dakota door.  I said yes, it was on the list of $188 doors.  She said no, only a basic, not really security door is $188.  Oh really, because that's not what the ad says.  She mentions the asterisk.  I clearly remember researching that asterisk.  i was careful to only chose a door from that series.  But she's now telling me the door that is $188 is not really a security door.  False advertising (will be reporting for that because I have wasted so much time and effort at this point.  Perhaps if she was not so rude, I wouldn't.).  I told her we would be going elsewhere then because I didn't appreciate the run around and felt they couldn't be trusted at this point.  She told me great, go ahead.  I then told her to have a nice life.  I had had enough at that point of her attitude so I stooped to her level.    So the old adage stands here.  If something looks too good to be true - it is.    PS, here are some screen shots showing their "deal".  When originally looked earlier this year, the add was slightly different and they were not as separated as they are now.  Either way though, it still says Star Series, and list the Star Series doors.

We went here a couple of weeks ago for karaoke and drinks.  I started with the house white which was awful.  Changed to Amaretto Sours and was okay.    The KJ was okay and lots of people sang.  Took about an hour before I got up there from the time I put in a slip.  Seems he doesn't quite understand how to add new people into a rotation.  The thing that stuck out in our minds was the staff's unwillingness to step on their own friends' toes.  While we were there, a group of women with a guy were in one room and a group of mostly guys were in the main area.  One of the bartenders (had a Jimmy's shirt on) sat with the group in the main area.  The guy with the ladies got up to sing an R Kelly song.  Somehow or another the guys sitting with the employee got up in the singers face and looked like he was going to hit him.  The singer kept singing and did a really good job of restraining himself.  Not once did any employee do anything to stop the harassment.  The group with the singer left shortly after that.  Then the guy started picking on another singer!  Unbelievable.  I have frequented many karaoke establishments in my lifetime and even hosted for a few years.  I have never had to deal with such blatant favoritism before.  If, as a host, I ever needed help with a patron, the staff always helped out without even being questioned.

First time we went, we had to walk out.  We didn't get service at all.  Not even a drink order.  But since we just moved to this area, we really wanted to find a great local Mexican place so we tried it again.    I wasn't super impressed.  Actually, I wasn't at all impressed.  It was okay food.  Okay service this time.  Their menu didn't offer the Mexican style I was hoping for.  It felt ... off to me.  Can't explain it.  They seemed to cater to either a nothing special appetite or a huge appetite, but not in between.  Does that make sense?  We did like the salsa and chips.  I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon though.

So we didn't actually use this guy because it turns out the shoe dye I went there to purchase isn't for dyeable shoes.  But that's okay, because they actually called around to find some for me!  That was awesome of them!

Wow, I can not believe I walked out of here paying $500 for my cat to feel better.  I know I could have spent less, but we had just moved to the area and I didn't know where I could get a vet quickly.  So I went.  They were slow and slow to examine.  I knew the only thing wrong with him was a UTI, but they wanted to sell me on everything in the book.  Finally, they tested him and kept him for the rest of the day for monitoring.  Give me a break.  I only spent this much and put up with all of it because they were guilt tripping me into it.    Then, for an entire year, I get numerous phone calls from them asking me to make a follow up appointment.  I had even asked them to stop calling.  Ugh.  I will never let another vet guilt trip me like that again.  I can't afford $500 and had to put it on credit.  I never do that.  Yes, the cat got better, but I wish they had listened to me and just tested really quick and given me the meds for him.

This review is for Jolene (hair) and Monica (makeup).  I went there today for my hair and makeup trials for my April wedding.    The atmosphere is wonderful.  As is the decor.    I sat with Jolene for hair first.  She looked at my veil and headpiece and the picture I wanted to look like and did exactly that.  She was friendly and got everything right!  My hair looks awesome and I kept getting compliments all day.  I can't wait for this look on the big day.  Next I sat with Monica.  We talked about what I was looking for and what she does.  She does do airbrushing but because I had a peel on my face yesterday, I couldn't really get the airbrushing done.  But she was able to my fake lashes and mineral makeup.  It looks great.  Between the two, I look like a beauty queen!  The only reason for 4 stars is a little confusion on the appointment scheduling and the price of the trials were high (but close to average in my opinion).

Holy candy Batman!  My fiance and I went here for our candy buffet for our wedding.  It wasn't as big as I thought it would be, but it was still a lot of candy.  The prices are higher than I was hoping for as well.  But you can find just about ANY type of candy ever made so that makes up for some of the prices.

Atmosphere is appealing.  The violin player was a nice touch.  However, everything else was rotten!  We came Valentine's weekend.    The lights were somewhat bright for a late night dinner.    The doors were all open and it was cold inside.  A poor older couple were sitting by the door and the elderly lady had to wear her coat and her husbands.  They still didn't close the door.    Service was very slow.  Awful.  All these reviews about great service made me think we had gone to a different restaurant than everyone else.  They didn't know the menu.  It took forever to get drinks.  Forever to get food.  Salad came out after dinner!  And the tiramisu was disastrous.  They covered it in Hershey's chocolate syrup!  Gross!  The two flavors do not go together at all.  The desert itself seemed odd without the syrup too.  Couldn't put my finger on it though.  We weren't the only table groaning about the place, every table around us was.  We all commiserated together.  Food was cold.  And dry.  Bill was pricey.  Will not ever go back.  They need to make some serious changes to this place or it won't last long.  The manager never walked around, just stood next to the bar the entire time while waiters struggled to get their jobs done.  The waiters (all in high school from what we could tell) were also too busy fooling around in the back and a big clang of breaking dishes were the result.

Kevin was professional and timely.  We wound up turning down a home due to his inspection results.  we used him for the second offer as well and we wound up buying that house.  We have now been in the house nearly 2 years and no major issues have come up other than what he pointed out.  We just referred him to our parents as they just put an offer on a house as well.

Wow, really good custard.  Love, love, love it.    The burgers are pretty good too.  Don't let their thinness fool you, they are filling.  The fires are kinda a pain though.  Their so skinny, they are hard to pick up and dunk in ketchup!    Sizes of the drinks and ice cream items are small.  But lets face it, do we really need all of those extra sugars?  However, given their size, I would have liked to see lower prices.  Matter of fact, prices are the only reason I can think of that this place didn't get 5 stars from me.

Found out about this place because Buy With Me had a great deal.    I took my husband and son and we rented a 9mm with 2 boxes of rounds and one target.  I wasn't feeling good so I didn't want to shoot (don't mix medications and guns together).  The man still let me in to watch since it was my 11 year old's first time.    They were really friendly and clean.  Unfortunately, we got there kinda late so by the time we were done, they were getting ready to close and inventory had been hidden away for the night so we didn't get to look at any of their guns.  Overall a great place.  It might seem out of the way, but didn't take us long to get to from our Chandler home.

Very disappointed. We left feeling jipped (spelling?).    We walked in unsure if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated. Someone came to seat us after a minute. The waitress got our drink order fairly quickly but didn't seem as interested in answering questions or taking our order. It didn't take forever, but longer than we thought it should.   We ordered the nachos to start. This took longer than it should have to get to our table.  They were made with the house potato chips, chicken, cheese, tomatoes, scallions, and sweet BBQ sauce. Could have used more sauce inside, but that's easily remedied with the sauces on the table.   My son ordered the blackened catfish (and plain ole fries) and said it was spicy. He otherwise enjoyed it.   I ordered the pulled pork sandwhich. It's what I use to judge every BBQ place we go to.  The bun was great. But the meat was just okay and didn't take up much space in the bun. Not worth the price. Came with a side and I got the jalapeño cole slaw. You could taste the jalapeño flavor, but it was dry and otherwise bland.   My husband got the 2 meat platter. It came out on a huge platter but took up not even half of it!  There were 4 small pieces of dry, flavorless thin cut turkey and 2 pieces of okay brisket. The garlic mash tasted watered down and bland. The dirty rice tasted dirty alright- like dirty dish water. Bland dirty dish water.   Overall, not worth the $60 we spent there!  I'd rather go out of my way to Joe's and spend less money and get my money's worth. Funny thing is, they have a little comment card that I filled out. If you turn it in, they email you $5 store credit. Yeah, we won't be back. Don't need that credit. How about half a refund instead?
