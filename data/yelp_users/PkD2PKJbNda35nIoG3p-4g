Wow! I had heard of this place on diners, drive ins and dives. We were in the area so we stopped in. I'm so happy we did. The food was so delicious. I had the beef flautas meal with rice and beans. The husband had a carne asado burrito. We split a carne street taco, best I've ever had. They give you your own hot sauce bottle,  which is great cause I can never have enough. I will definitely be back.

I saw this place featured on DDD and my mouth watered upon viewing the apple cake and dutch baby. I drove the 45 minutes up the 101 to get my hands on this delectible meal. The service was ok, nothing special, borderline rude, but I don't let that ruin my meal if it's good. I was super happy to see that they offer Junior portions of their famous pancakes. So yes, I had two. I ordered the apple cake and the dutch baby (don't judge me) Both cakes were better looking than tasting. The middle of both cakes were a unsweetened chewy flan-like consistency. The edge of the apple cake was ok so I ate that along with my hashbrowns and bacon but still left slightly unsatisfied. I also had to pay for the rest of my party when we realized that they do not accept credit cards! ????!!!! There is an atm that charges a $5 fee, yay. I won't be back, the drive is too far for something that is just meh.

Delicious appetizers while you wait 20 for main course.  I've been to this location and many others a lot of times and I am always happy to be there. It's the way they greet you like they are so happy to see you, the way they say goodbye like they can't wait for you to come back and the way they serve you like it's been their dream job. The food is always on point and I have never had a bad experience. I've tried the Pablo Picasso salad, a large lovely salad with tortilla strips, spicy chicken, cheese, pico de gallo and spicy dressing (available in a smaller size). The Alfredo the Darkwith chicken, pasta with alreado, pico de gallo, and a spicy salted jalapeno (always take home leftovers). The last time I was there the waitress was pretty MIA but that was a first ever. I'm  sure she was just having a rough day and let's face it, SERVERS ARE HUMAN TOO! I will definetely be back regardless.

I've seen this place at the Santan mall a few times on my way out and noticed it had a happy hour so I took my bf for a whirl. The HH is actually really nice! The house margaritas are reasonably priced and very delicious (my mouth is watering just thinking about it) They also have XX which pleased the bf. We had a chicken quesadillas appetizer and shared the tacos al carbon. Both were super delicious, the meat was juicy and the meal was huge! I was very happy with the service we received here which was our bartender. I will definetely be back!

I love this place! The green chili skillet is my favorite and you can substitute buttermilk pancakes for a small up charge instead of toast.

My boyfriend and I recently went here for happy hour and were pleasantly surprised. I had the dragonfly mojito and it was super yummy and such a girly drink, only $5 on happy hour! We ordered the egg rolls, crab dip and slider combo. All the food was completely delicious and hot. Our waitress, Erica V, was very sweet and attentive (wish there were more like her). The only thing was the total bill was pricey because we overindulged in all the yummy appetizers and drinks. We will be back!

This place has delicious fresh seafood along with other non seafood items. The server was very attentive and sweet. I would definitely recommend this place to seafood lovers.

I have been to Jump Street a number of times just to free jump and thought it would be a great idea to bring my son there for his 3rd birthday since he liked the free jump so much. I called ahead as the website suggestes you do and reserved a time for his party. I was given a total cost for the number of guests, pizza, cake and balloons. When I got to Jump Street we were told we'd have an hour of jump time and then the pizza would arrive and we could eat and that would be the end of our time there. It took an hour and half for our pizza to arrive and by then everybody was starving. We were not given drinks with the pizza so my guests were trying to get drinks from the vending machines and I was then told I could purchase drinks from the front counter at an additional price, which ended up being an additional $50. By the time I was waited on and given my drinks another 20 minutes had passed. When we were ready for the cake I was told it was frozen still because someone had forgotten to take the cake out of the freezer when we arrived. So we had to wait another 30 minutes for the cake. You are supposed to be given a "party manager" to help with your event but I only saw mine when I first checked in. There wasn't anyone around to help clean, serve or answer questions. At the end of our lunch time again my party manager wasn't around to pay for my party so I started filling my car up with the gifts from the party. The party manager then came outside as I was filling up my car and demanded payment as if I was trying to leave without paying. I had been filling up my car for about 20 minutes and half my guests were still inside cleaning up what others were paid to do so there was no obvious intent to leave. I follwed her inside to pay for this completely unorganized party and was asked to give a review on my time there but I felt incredibly awkward writing a review right in front of the person who I felt contributed to the downfall of this event running smoothly. I guess all in all my son didn't notice that his party wasn't given the attention it should have been given by the staff since he got extra jump time but as a mother I will not book another party there and I will not suggest this to another mother. Also, my guests do not want to go back there after having seen this take place.

5 stars for food. Knocked one off for sour puss server. Would it kill you to smile?  We got the sleepy dog red rover irish ale and kilt lifter beers. Both were so good and chilled to perfection. The mac and cheese burger was calling our name which we answered with a pretzel bun, of course. The best burger I've ever had,  no joke. We will be back and hopefully we won't get the same debby downer server.

Delicious food. Friendly and attentive server. We tried the meatball sub with zucchini chips and the chicken Limon. My son had the kids meatballs with marinara. All were tasty and very satisfying.  We will be back!

First time in here and was not disappointed. The donuts are really delicious! Much better than dunkin donuts or Krispy kreme. I also tried the blended chai tea with boba and that was yummy as well. The lovely lady working was very nice. I will definitely be back.

This place has the best cheeseburgers I've ever had! I've tried the juicy lucy and the cb&cb. Both were equally delicious in their own way. They have lots of beer on tap and my favorite red ale. This is easily one of my favorite restaurants. The waitresses are sweet and attentive. I never had to ask for a refill. There are tons of tvs to keep the husband entertained too
