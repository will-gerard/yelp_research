The staff here are extremely personable and friendly. The room was big enough to accommodate my 7 family members and was really comfortable. The goodie bag was filled with lots of great stuff too! Overall, we were extremely pleased with our experience and recommend it to anyone looking for a great ultrasound place!

Don't waste your time or money with this company. Pool guy didn't show up for 3 weeks and when we brought it to their attention, they did very little for us as a customer for their mistake. When they actually do show up, it is a coin toss on whether or not the pool will actually be properly cleaned.

Heather and Michelle are amazing! Michelle did my hair for the first time yesterday because Heather was booked and I couldn't be happier with the results. She took the time to make sure that my hair turned out exactly the way I wanted even though it put her a little behind. If you need your hair done, I highly recommend checking out The Savvy Stylist!
