Went in today with my mom for a pedicure.  Both of us asked for the callus removal - knowing it was going to cost extra for this service.  The lady doing my pedi scrubbed my feet with the pumice stone but never brought out the metal callus removal tool.  My favorite part of a massage is the callus removal, I am pretty crazy about soft feet.  Twice I asked her if she heard me say I wanted the callus removal and she said yes.  As she was getting ready to start painting my nails I clarified again - and she said she had already done the callus removal with the pumice.  I asked if she would use the metal tool and she said no, they were the same thing.  I said in the past I had the other tool, pointed to it, and explained that I really liked it.  She said "the stone was new" and just the same. In the mean time my mom had both the pumice stone and the other metal tool used.  The two ladies sitting next to her who also asked for calls removal also had both tools used.  I've gone to this salon before and not requested the callus removal and at the bare minimum the pumice was used, always at no extra charge.  I didn't even no how to argue with her at this point since I had asked/clarified so many times. After a long summer in flip flops I really needed this service done.  I've had mediocre service at this salon before and won't be returning in the future, even though it's only a half a mile from my house.  They did a good job putting the nail polish on, but let's be honest I could do that at home.  I don't pay for a pedicure just I get nail polish put on.

Was back at TOTTS last night - and it never lets me down!!  Last night I had the Twins Pork which is always one of my favorite go-to items on the menu.  The owner, Young, is as friendly as they come. He will go above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience!

Love margaritaville... Until now. For overpriced food and drinks you come for the scenery. They closed the top floor "because management said so". Cool, so they sat us with a view of the strip... Cool, what that meant is a view of the walk next to the strip.  Whatever the nachos are great so it's worth it right? 25 minutes later no one looked at us so we're out. Manager said someone went home so they got confused... Usually don't write reviews for bad service but they sat us well after they knew the server Left. Done with them.

I'm 5'1.... on a good day, with a shoe that has a little lift ;)  So a good tailor is absolutely necessary for almost everything.  I've been coming to AJ Tailors & Cleaners for the last 15+ years.  I've tried a few other places now and then as I've moved all around the Valley hoping to find a place that was comparable but closer to where I lived.  I always find my way back to AJ's.  They are the best - and extremely friendly and kind.  The prices are extremely reasonable as well!!

My husband, parents and I went to Kings Fish House at the beginning of March for my husbands birthday.  He is from Oregon, and a little bit of a seafood snob.  He really wanted seafood for his birthday meal.  We checked out places on Yelp but couldn't find any place that had great reviews and was in our price range.  We decided to take a chance on King's Fish House, and to be honest we were a little skeptical of a chain restaurant.   Not to mention my husband and his family goes clamming off of the Oregon coast several times a year, so he has high expectations for fresh clams. We were absolutely blown away by everything about this restaurant.   Our server for the night was Chris G, and he gave us some amazing recommendations.  He really listened to what flavors each of like individually and made individualized his recommendations for each of us.  Even pairing it with some wine and side dish recommendations.  Not to mention his recommendations for clams were spot on!!  Each of us had a different dish, and each of us swore we had the best dish at the restaurant.    In April we celebrated my fathers birthday, and he requested we go back to King's Fish House.  As soon as we walked in, we saw Chris. We requested him to be our server again.  Not only did he remember us, but he remembered what we had ordered a month earlier.  AMAZING!!  He gave us some new recommendations, and again his service was incredible!!  My personal recommendation... go to the Kings Fish House and sit in Chris' section.  Get some of the Skookum clams if they are in, and definitely try the Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut.  Delicious!!  We will be back again very soon!!

My husband and I have been hearing about Pomegranate Cafe for the last year, but really never had the chance to try it. Okay - I shouldn't lie, I think we were hesitant because it is a vegetarian restaurant, and we love our meet.  But we were intrigued because of the gluten free options (something that is critical to my husbands health).  Now I am super sad that we waited so long.  We have been missing one of the best restaurants in the Valley.  Both my husband and I had sandwiches for lunch last weekend.  I have never had such distinct flavors in a sandwich before.  It was beyond delicious!!  Maybe getting rid of the meet is critical to really letting my taste buds do their work!!  After lunch my husband and I split their gluten free Tiramisu, and it was HEAVENLY!!!!!!    The staff was super friendly, the service was quick, and the place is very cute and clean.  We will be back very soon (most likely this weekend)!!  I can't wait to share it with all of my friends!!   YUM!!!!!

My husband and I went to El Rico's tonight - searching for something new {and praying for something yummy}.  We have passed by El Rico's a few times since we live in the Islands and decided tonight would be a great evening to try it out.  It was obvious that the restaurant had been renovated in the last few weeks.  So in regard to any post about paint peeling and bare walls - you need not worry.  The ambience is very nice and feels very authentic.  El Rico's has a nice outside patio, and since tonight was one of the first cool evenings this fall, we took full advantage.  I ordered the #2 combo - Taco and Tostada, and my husband had two taco's {one shredded beef and one shredded chicken}.  Both of us had margaritas - and we only spent $25!!  The chips were sooo good - and the taco's were incredible!!  We decided we will definitely be going back for Taco Tuesday.  The margaritas were very good as well.  I was afraid it might be a weak margarita - but it absolutely wasn't.  I am an Arizona native, and my grandfather was 100% hispanic, so I am used to good mexican food.  This did not disappoint.  The food was not spicy {which is absolutely okay}, but did have GREAT flavor.  The only tiny criticism I had was the service.  I hesitate even saying anything because the servers were awesome.  The only challenge is that they were so busy, that they probably could have used another server on staff for the evening.  The owner was out helping bus tables and serve food, something that I always appreciate seeing.  Our food came out fast, and hot.  You could just tell that the staff was VERY busy... which isn't a bad thing for a new restaurant.

Another great meal at El Rico's. I had the flautas and my husband had the tacos.  Best chips - I could go there just for this reason. We really enjoy their normal salsa... aren't too impressed with their "hot" salsa. I really enjoy spicy salsa, and I found this tone rather bland and not that "hot".  Thankfully their normal salsa is exceptionally good!!

I love the US Egg - but the service at this location is AWFUL!! I have been going to the Tempe location for the last 15 years and it is a well oiled machine... The food is perfect and the service is awesome!! The new Chandler location has just as good as food, but after we got seated we waited 30 minutes to order and then we waited another 30 minutes to get out order (for two people).  After we were done eating we didn't see our server for another 20 minutes until we had to stop her as she was walking by and request our bill.  You may want to wait a few months until the service improves, go to the Tempe location in the mean time.

Great bar... Good food (or at least what we had).  We had the nachos and the wings.  Server was really knowledgable about the menu and selections and we never had to wait to ask for a new beer.  Great service!! Beer was $3.50 for a 14 ounce and $4.50 for a 20 ounce.  $1 off during happy hour - and all appetizers were half off during happy hour.   I'm sure I'm missing some of the HH details!!  They have darts, video bowling, video golf and six pool tables.  Lots of TVs.  And for the previous review about Dennis Erickson... My dads even in several times since it opened as Lucky Break and has seen DE twice.  He chatted with him one time and it sounds like he still has some ownership in this place.  Overall a great environment!! Happy it's walking distance from our house!!

I have been attending Boojum OBGYN for my prenatal care and have been EXTREMELY impressed.  We have been working very closely with Ramona, one of their midwives, and she is amazing.  So compassionate and caring.  On several occasions we have had the chance to meet and chat with Dr. Kells.  He does not seem like the normal physician these days - he cares about his patients, and doesn't mind taking time to talk to you and answer question (or work behind the front desk - for that matter).  I don't feel like another number/paycheck at Boojum!  I have been so impressed.  My appointments are always on time and they are always prepared for my visits!  I have recommended Boojum to several friends, and Boojum was recommended to me by several friends!!

As I got closer to my due date... in fact only 10 days away I got a phone call that my midwife had left the practice.  She had given 90 days notice but they had let her go immediately.  That's not a kind thing to do to a woman who was within days of delivering.  95% of my appointments were with a certain midwife, and with her gone I felt completely alone!!  When I went in to meet with the staff after getting this news, Doctor Kells met with me and was really unkind about my weight gain.  I had only gained 25 pounds - I didn't think that was too bad.  He said I should probably think about having a c-section since he thought that based off of looking at me I was going to have a big baby.  Ended up that my baby was only 6lbs 11 ounces.  I don't count that big at all.  I was able to follow my midwife (Praise God!!) and switched practices days before delivering.   During my last appointment at Boojum, one of the front desk ladies came from behind the counter and gave me a hug.  She was crying.  She apologized for the situation I was in, and said she was just as devastated.   She apologized again and again saying that I was put in a horrible situation.  I think its pretty awful that people think about the bottom line, and losing patients, as opposed to being good to the customer/patient.  Especially with people who are needing care for such an important part of their life.  I can't think of much that is more important than giving birth for the first time.  I am pretty frustrated with the way this office handled the entire transition.  I know of 3 people who have left the practice after this transition because of other ways their level of care was handled.

This is one of our most favorite place for my husband and I to meet for a lunch date!! It's a convenient location for both of us.  But that isn't the only reason we like this place.  The street Tacos are awesome - particularly the Al Pastor.  The chips and salsa have always been refillable (so even if the portion size is small as another post said before, you can always get more!!). We particularly like their hot salsa - such great flavor!!   What really sold us on this place... the customer service!! Always above average - consistently asked if we need anything, how out experience had been and everyone in there has a GREAT attitude!!  We often brig our 18 month old son and never feel bad for the mess he throws on the floor.  Every time we have started to clean up after him they stop is and finish the job, with a smile on their face!!   We will continue to tell all our friends and family about this place!!

Good food BUT NOT KID FRIENDLY.  The only reason I say this is because there are no high chairs or boosters in the entire restaurant.  Which can make the dining experience really challenging with an on-the-go toddler.  Beautiful patio for those amazing AZ evenings, but the only way we could keep our kid from not running around like a crazy person was moving inside half way through our meal so we could trap him in a booth.  I understand that Minder Binders may not be trying to market towards families, but there are always several families with little ones here.  Even some of my favorite sports bars have a high chair for the occasional little one.

Came here with my husband, brother-in-law and sister-in-law for our first night out after having our twins!! We had been here once before and I had been craving the amazing Brussels sprouts nachos.  Steven was a great server and made a ton of awesome recommendations.  We followed nearly every one, including three desserts that were by far the most amazing thing this mama has had in a long time.  The Braised Pineapple pork and Green Chili Chicken tacos were also on point! We will be back again very soon - and I will most definitely be asking to end the evening with a Campfire!  Thanks for an awesome evening out!!
