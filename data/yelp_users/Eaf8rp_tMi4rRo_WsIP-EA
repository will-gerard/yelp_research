Overrated! Service was terrible and food was below average. Tables were dirty and server refused to get cucumbers from the sushi bar, even we offered to pay for them. I offered the Gomoku Yaki Udon - pork was overcooked and overrun with whole calamari that still had eyes... Interesting decorating - Asian, Italian, and French with Christmas lights. Disappointed... :/

Stopped in last night about 45 minutes before closing for a quick bite after about 2 years. The food was great like I remembered but the service was terrible. Our female server was unfriendly and impatient, as if our order was an inconvenience to her. She rarely checked in our table except to collect the bill, we had to ask the host to bring us utensils, soy sauce, etc. We were greatly disappointed and will definitely consider other restaurants over Sakana.

Food and service were amazing, even with one server. I highly recommend the Chirashi. They do have a bar and pour strong drinks. Enjoyed my experience, will go back. The bathroom is in serious need of an update and lighting.

One of the best, if not the best sushi in East Valley. Service was excellent. Family-owned business and able to answer all questions. Atmosphere and decor were high-end but comfortable, music couldn't have been better. Happy Hour menu could use some more items, however that's not why we choose to eat there. Love, love, loved Chirashi Sushi bowl. Special strawberry custard crepe dessert was amazing! Definitely adding to my favorite sushi restaurants, can't wait to go back.

I've been going here for years with my family. It was easy to confirm that they took Cigna Vision over the phone and I was able to fill out my forms online before my appointment. I did not have to wait more than 10 minutes  to see the doctor and I was out of there within an hour after picking out my new frames.

Great atmosphere, decor & service! I had the salerno bruschetta plate, spicy harissa fries, & duxelles burger - all delicious and very filling. Also, tried the Friday Special $4 vodka pomegranate press, was a bit strong and on the sour/tangy side. Would give this restaurant 5 stars, but I'm allergic to cinnamon... Will go back soon

Best Greek food in Chandler!   Pita are soft, warm, and fresh. Salads are amazing! They treat you like family here, fast and friendly. Everything I have tried has been phenomenal, CAN'T WAIT for the 2nd location to open near Ikea on Warner & Priest.

Great find and recommendation from our server at C.A.S.A. I tried a ice cream sandwich with strawberry ice cream and chocolate chip cookies, SO DELICIOUS! Ice cream was fantastic, not sure of the brand. Cookies were soft and chewy. Best dessert for $2.00 - next time I get a few to take home :)

Ate here last night and loved it! Sushi was fresh and greatly portioned. Sushi Chef and owner Jin, visited our table and provided excellent recommendations and shared his knowledge with us about sushi. Atmosphere (decor, music, and service) was amazing... Will definitely become a regular!

Stopped by after work, looking for someplace new and was pleasantly surprised. 1) It was Taco Tuesday, $1 street tacos 2) On Tuesdays happy hour is extended until 8pm 3) The Reggae/Island music selection set the mood 4) Service was fantastic 5) Caipirinha cocktails for $5 are great. Will definitely return to try the other dishes!

Wonderful addition to downtown Tempe. Watched the AZ Cardinals game, they actually play game sound in the back bar. The menu is different from the Camelback location, but still fantastic. There is so much space for large groups and games. Will absolutely be returning - try the Shrimp & Pork Belly Ramen, delicious :)

I absolutely love this place! Brunch is the best, try the Michelada and Huevos Ranchos or the B.E.A.T. Sandwich. I'm not the biggest fan of bacon but theirs is heavenly, yes heavenly. You don't have to wait for a table, bar is open seating just slide on in :) Staff is phenomenal & food is delivered quickly. I try to make it here every weekend.

First timer & hooked. Had a pound of Shrimp & a pound of King Crab legs, both in Trifecta Sauce at Medium. Delicious and spicy, next time will get mild sauce with side of medium. The dozen raw oysters were amazing too - plump and juicy. Kevin took care of us. Finished the meal with chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. Very, very messy; no plates, no utensils - so worth it!
