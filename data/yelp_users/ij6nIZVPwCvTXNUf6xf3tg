This place I have wanted to try for weeks.....well months....well years.  My girlfriend and I went and love a good strip club.  The dancers were very friendly and hot.  Drinks were a bit overpriced, but it is a strip club so expected.  Had to work to get a lapdance as nobody approached the couple....that was weird.  Usually the dancers at clubs are very friendly, so they should work on that.  Lots of diversity, didn't try the private VIP but it looked worth it.

Tony and crew lure you in with a $86.50 fee for a diagnostic and then found a horn ring or clock spring issue.  This is a cheap part and 30 min of labor according to the dealer.  We got hit with a charge of $565!  According to the dealer this should have been no more than $250 part and labor.  I recommend having any electrical diagnosed elsewhere as they used to be a great shop but have slid in recent years.  Buyer beware.

Always judge a pizza place by the simple cheese pizza.  This place was awesome, very quick, friendly, cheap and yummy.  I go here when I take my boys to Kumon next door, it is right off the 51 at Northern.  Highly recommend for a cheap, quality pizza.

Wow, lived here for 10 years and never knew this was here.  In a Quaker building right off the 51 is one of the most Americana events you can catch.  Folk music played accoustically, by a varied group of folks.  My son loved it as did my girlfriend.  Cheap coffee for $1.00 and sodas, along with homemade baked goods round out the offering.  It really isn't a coffee house as much as a great place to hear music.  Very sparse (think Quaker) but a perfect environment for the music.  If you need to chill out for a few hours, hit this place up.  There are few places in America where you will see this environment.  Everyone is welcoming and nice, we will definately return.

Cheap entry fees and $5 lap dances are amazing.  Chill place to hang out. Been with my girlfriend and she loves it and has always had a great time.

Hard to get excited about a pharmacy, but this local store is always friendly, well stocked and has a great Redbox in it.  My kids and I are ALWAYS here for something!

My son just bought his first paintball gun, hopper, mask, etc from these guys.  Their prices are the same as online, so why not establish a relationship with a store where you will need to go to get stuff serviced.  The team here is very patient and has amazing knowledge.  They really know their stuff and take the time to walk you through everyting.  The store is clean and well organized.  This will be our go to spot for all paintball.

This place is always clean, not too busy with friendly people ready to help.  Good selection and competitive prices.    Coaching a flag football team, I am here quite a bit for gear.  My boys love the selection from air soft guns to golf gear.

From the outside of this strip mall joint, you would expect typical low end Mexican you get on Bell Road in Phoenix.  NOT THE CASE - THIS IS EXCELLENT!  When you enter, it appears to be primarily take out with only a few tables, but sit and eat here.  The owner personally waits on you and is awesome.  The nicest person with great recommendations and knows his menu and food.    On to the food....WOW, everything was yummy, perfect flavors, taste, temperature, etc.  Quick service, great food, cheap prices....I have a new Mexican favorite.

Local neighborhood bar, easily accessible from the 51.  I love the karaoke and the crowd.  They are cheap, quick and friendly....everything I look for in a bar.  Bartender was awesome in dealing with a drunk patron....I would have beat his #*$( for what he was saying but she was smooth.

Great burger, taco, salad, nacho place.  I love the decor, feel like I am in Hawaii.  Quick service and the Strawberry Lemonade is yummy.  Seems no matter when I go, I never have to wait, but they are packed.  I love the burger slections, something for anyone.

Called and he was easy to schedule with and did a great job on a Canadian passport photo.  He knew the size and was very informed on the regulations.  Great job, reasonable price and easy to deal with.

Great cleaners, been using them for a few years.  They are on the expensive side, but do a consistently great job.  Little details like buttoning the shirts, pinning the arms in place.  The owner is usually onsite and his staff is great.  Very nice drive up service as well.

Possibly worst hotel I've stayed at....for sure worst in Vegas.  Rooms are old and tired.  No hot water.  Vinyl flooring and $29 resort fee for Internet.  Looking to check out 4 days early and find a better hotel.

Had the chicken fries which were awesome!  Good beer selection, TV, pool, darts....live music....uh what else do you want in an irish bar?  I frequent this place when looking for live music during the week.  Cold pints are a plus and the clientele seems very friendly.

We had a leak that Lyon roofing fixed a few years back that leaked again this year.  We called Tim at AVC and they came out the next day for an estimate.  We had three other estimates and they were lowest.  Tim took the time to explain the reason we have a leak spot, what the other company did wrong in their previous repair, how he was going to fix it so it won't re-occur, who was going to do it, how long it would take, materials they would use, etc..... In great detail they won my confidence and I hired them on the spot.  They came THE NEXT DAY!  The repair took several hours longer than they estimated, but there was no additional charge.  Also they noticed loose tiles and secured those, so they won't be an ongoing issue.  It is rare that you find a contractor so honest, so professional that you want to tell everyone you know...but these guys are it.  I highly recommend them for whatever your roofing project may be.

The remodeled store is super.  Won't find fresher veggies or a better selection of meat.    They have it all, if you can't find it here....you probably don't need it.  Great ethnic selection as well.  Very attentive to service and friendly staff.  Covered parking, valet, car wash so your vehicle is happy too!

Hip hotel in a great location.  Search hotel discount sites to get great rate on room. Not a luxury hotel but very clean and movie theme is well executed in rooms.  Connected to miracle mile shops so lots of walking options outside of casino.  Gaming is fun and lively.  People very friendly and nice mix of adult and kid friendly options for dining and entertainment.

We have been a few times and this tucked away little treasure never disappoints.  Great service, very attentive to our requests (close the door, dim the lights, etc).  Joe the owner monitors everything very closely....food, staff, customers dinning experience.  He also come at the end to allow you a chance at winning a free meal.  Alcohol is a bit pricey with $15 for a martini and $8 for a shot of Baileys.  Food and service....atmosphere are a definate 5 stars.  If your looking for a local spot for great Italian....this is it.  Reminds me of NY.

This old town spot has an amazing atmosphere.  Dim lighting, rich wood and hardwood floors add to the cute outdoor patio area for a great location.  The menu is like Tapas and the tableside guacamole  is excellent, best I've tasted.  Prices are typical Scottsdale, but portions are fair for the price.  Service was excellent and drink refills were always plentiful.  Tacos are yummy, try the pork for sure at lunch.    Restroom decor is even very chic.  The staff were perfect, very professional.  When your in the mood to drop $50 on lunch for two, this is the place for sure.  Table were a little small given the sharing design and small dishes menu is my only feedback.

Really clean and awesome amounts of flavors.  High quality and tasty flavors.  Good service from the staff on a weekday evening.  My 4 star rating is due to the price which I felt was  bit much for one scoop.

The club itself is nice.  We ate at Andreas which was amazing, then bought VIP tickets to club.  Didn't need to do that so was given incorrect info by concierge at Wynn Towers, great.  Went as a couple and there was no where to sit, unless we spent $600 on bottle service.  Uh that is great if your a large group.  We bought drinks $37 for 2 and then were told we couldn't stand next to the dance floor.  We were told we couldn't stand at the bar, uh where would you like us?  Music was good but if your not in a large group this is not your place.    This was the first night of our honeymoon and it was upsetting.  We were so disappointed we just went back to our room.  There are way better, more friendly experiences and I only chose this as we were staying in the tower suites and it was convenient.

Great location tucked away behind Islands.  Non fat selection is excellent and Tuesday night is kids night for .99.  It can get expensive so limit yourself as the cost is by the oz.  Me and my two boys easily racked up $13 in yogurt!  Lots of samples and about 12 flavors.  They change frequently to keep you coming back.

Thomas and his awesome machine cleaned our carpets like nobody else has been able to.  He took the time to come in and move furniture and ensure all of it was moved back.  He is professional and have great prices.  We highly recommend him.

We took our Jeep Commander into these folks, based on shopping around.  We looked at everyone and for tires, they were absolutely the lowest.  The location was amazingly clean and well layed out.   They had the biggest tire selection in the area.  They were running a special to include 4 free oil changes too!  If all this wasn't enough, we went in and requested the wrong tire size, they cautioned us and installed them as requested.  Then we realized they were rubbing and went back and they immediately without any questions changed them to what they should have been.  The service we received was amazing, best I have ever gotten for auto repair.  Prices were reasonable and the location is very convenient.  They get busy, so get there early, but you can't go wrong here.  Oh and I shot an email to corporate and Jerry Fletcher Jr. personally responded!  I have a new home for all my auto care.

Gerald and his crew are awesome.  Over the years we have had 5 or 6 guys and The Pool Steward is the best by far.  They charge a reasonable monthly fee and do a great job.  Normally that is what I expect and I wouldn't be writing a review.  Before I hired them, I took my green water to Leslies who told me I needed to drain my pool, which I had just done less than a year ago.  I called Gerald and he came out and put in a device called PoolRX and it cleared up my pool in 2 days.  I have never had cleaner water and now we enjoy our pool a ton more.

Chaos Comedy is located at the Dearing Acting Studio.  This improv troop has a great show for families on Saturdays at 7 in a comfortable theater.  Once a month they put on a 18 and over show at midnight which is awesome.  The players are excellent and the show is only an hour, so it is a great way to start off your Saturday night.  Prices are reasonable and snacks are cheap.  They have us laughing almost the entire time were there and everyone is very friendly in this family owned business.

Worst Walmart ever.  So understaffed they shouldn't even be open.  They pages and pages for help nobody came.  Nobody knows what they are doing.  Phone just ringing off the hook.  Drive to Bell road it is worth it.

Can I give a lower review? Went for a school fundraiser and they wouldn't honor the credit to the school without the flyer.  Ridiculous in this day and digital age.  Won't ever patronize this chain again and will ensure all my friends know what a scam this is about how they patronize education.

Worst lab in the Valley.  No system - you will wait for hours for what should take 5 minutes.  Sonoran Quest makes these fools look silly.  Why they are still in business is beyond me.  Do not come here it will be a huge waste of your day.

This bakery is a hidden gem.  Cakes are amazing, fort fondant I actually enjoy.  Nina makes cake balls that are a must try.  She has them all the time in store so just swing by and get a few.  These are easier to eat than a cupcake so they are perfect in bulk at a party as guests can hold in one hand and eat in a few bites.  We go almost every weekend.
