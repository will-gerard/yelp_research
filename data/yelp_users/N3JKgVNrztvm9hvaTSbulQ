Customer service was fantastic. Hostess was polite and entertaining. Waitress was on top of things and friendly. Usually love outback. But, Got food poisoning. Don't eat the prime ribeye.

Tom and his crew always do an amazing job accommodating myself and my clients, even in the latest of late notices. They are professional, timely, and the value is unmatched. Their adaptability and consistency in customer service is astonishing and I am so thankful for having them as a business partner and friend. Highly recommend!
