First of all it's right next to the freeway so it's hard to even turn in. Then you get there and there's limited parking cause it's soooo busy. Your options to order are Chicken fingers, chicken fingers and chicken fingers.(I understand it's a finger joint but lets have some other options) I order and the food comes out quick. The fingers aren't  even crispy and the sauce is some weird Thousand Island/Ranch/Peppercorn.Then the fingers are  Non-crispy! So you're saying you cant make the one thing you have on the menu?! So we're sitting at a large table for a little lunch business meeting and the Manager comes up to us and with a snarky tone brings up that we have to pay by the minute. Hahahaha. One of those, "I'm kidding but not kidding" kind of remarks. Crowd was casual biz. Don't recommend it and don't see what the hype is about.

I was looking for movers on Groupon and Living Social when I actually stumbled across Skinny Wimp Moving Co. It was a Groupon for 3 guys for 2hrs and a 17ft truck. First I have to say I saw some shady movers on both sites. The reason I went with SWM was because I saw that they were in two states and 5 counties. On top of that they had profiles of the gentleman that were going to be serving me. Made me feel completely comfortable that i wasn't going to get jacked. I bought the Groupon on a Thursday night and needed movers Saturday. Next to impossible right? NOPE! A pleasant young lady called me Friday morning and got me set up Sat between 1pm and 6pm. Kevin calls me at 12:45pm and lets me know they'll be showing up at 1pm. Legit. No waiting around all day. To top it off they show up with 5 dudes and get my place moved in 1hr and 15 min! Crazy nice guys, they hustle and was a fantastic experience. I would pay double if I had too!
