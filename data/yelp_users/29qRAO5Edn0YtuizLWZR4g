My dad was in town to celebrate his birthday & I thought this would be a really fun place to bring him one afternoon for dessert.  As we walked in we were told to seat ourselves.  As we sat down a server came with menus & my mom told him that we were just here for dessert.  He gave a little sigh of annoyance & said he would be back to take our order.  He came by & dropped off 2 waters (um, there's 4 of us.) We just shrugged it off & ordered. My mom ordered a sundae, my dad, husband & I ordered floats. He dropped them off & we never saw him again. He was actually ignoring us. I was so embarrassed that I picked this place! The floats were just okay, very artificial tasting.  We finally went up to the front & the cashier asked where our ticket was, we explained we didn't have one so she also gave us a sigh of annoyance & went to find our server. Well excuse us for spending $30 on ice cream! You'd think with those prices the service would be much better. We'll take our money somewhere else next time.

Found this on Yelp & decided we HAD to come check it out. I'm a huge fan of chicken fried chicken, I know everyone said this was known for the steak but I figured they would both be great.  I was correct! Our server & all other staff we came in contact with was super sweet. Our food came out piping hot exactly how we ordered it. Huge pieces of chicken, my husband & I could of easily shared it. Only complaint was the breading fell off of every piece I would cut. Eh. Oh well. We will def be back.

I feel like I've been searching all over the valley for NM style food! We made the 40 mile drive over here to meet with some friends because we heard that this was the place to go for NM food. We were seated right away & started with some cocktails which were great. Our server brought out a platter of chips with 4 different dips/salsas, score! I ordered the shredded beef burrito enchilada style which was SOO good. The meat was so flavorful & it was actual green chile! I felt like I was back home in NM :) My husband ordered ground beef gorditas which he loved. Our friend ordered chicken gorditas but they brought out beef & it took a very very long time for him to receive the correct order. We were all finished with our food by the time his arrived.  Our server never apologized for the error, just kinda took the plate & left which is what took my review from a 5 star to a 4. When we were leaving around 12:30pm people were lined up all outside, this place gets pretty busy! Can't wait to come back here for another burrito!

I'm really surprised with the low ratings, I loved this place! We got there around 5:15 in the evening & were seated right away, service was lacking but the food made up for it. My husband & I both ordered the $5.99 spaghetti & meatballs special. It was sooooo good. I'm not usually very impressed by such a simple dish but man, those meatballs are amazing. They also had some really good happy hour deals until 6pm that I want to try & come back for.

I love, love, love Trader Joe's. Some of the best customer service I've ever received have been from TJ's stores. I experienced one of the rudest workers ever at the checkout at this location. I will probably be picking another location to go to.

So now that I've been here multiple times, I must say that the rude worker was probably having an off day. Every time I've been in here everyone has been super helpful, it's always clean & everyone is friendly. LOVE TJ's!!

I didn't try any of the salon services so this review is just about the store.  I've never been to a Beauty Brands before but I heard about an amazing $9 hairspray sale they had.  I went & the girls were so sweet & helpful, the store was easy to navigate & they even had a pretty nice clearance section.  I'll be visiting this store more often.

I'm not sure if I wanted to give 3 or 4 stars...hubby & I sat at the bar & started with a beer & a frozen swirled sangria (so good btw) they brought out chips & 3 different salsas.  We got there a little before 9pm when Happy Hour started so we waited to order the dip trio, they were great! $5 for 3 different dips is an awesome deal in my book, especially when they keep refilling chips for you.  Husband ordered a street taco & it took about 15-20 min for it to come out which was disappointing since the bar area wasn't very busy at all.  Service was a bit slow but we had a great time snacking on chips & cooling off with yummy drinks.

I came here to see the Hollywood Costume exhibit that I purchased a Groupon for. There was quite a long line to get our tickets & the lady at the door was very unfriendly.  But it was all okay because once we got in we went straight to the exhibit and we were really impressed.  I loved reading about the costume designers & their thoughts for designing the different outfits.  It took a bit to get through it all since some people were going VERRRRY slowly through the exhibit & others would just cut in front of you as you are reading. We also enjoyed all the cute items they had in the gift shop.  We wanted to stay & check out the rest of the museum but we were pretty short on time.   We will be back soon to look at the other areas.

Came here for their Wednesday night special, $5.99 for a large cheese pizza. Got here around 8 & were seated right away, they have plenty of TV's for watching the game.  Service was pretty slow but we weren't in a hurry. The pizza was GREAT! More like a pan pizza (thicker crust).  We had half leftover so we had dinner & lunch the next day for $6! Awesome! Their menu was huge & I noticed they had quite a few other weekly specials. Will be back next Wednesday :)

Happened to be driving by & this caught my attention. My chili cheese dog craving was needing to be filled.  We each ordered their beef chili cheese dog which came with fries & also an order of onion rings. Hot dog was barely warm, chili was very flavorful but I just really don't enjoy almost cold hot dogs.  I used the leftover chili/cheese to dip my fries in which was pretty good! Not planning on rushing back here, we just weren't "wowed"

Got our food to-go so I can't comment on the inside (I waited in the car) but man, my car smelt aaaaaaaamazing. Between the 4 of us, we had Moo Goo Gai Pan, Kung Pao Chicken, House Fried Rice & House Lo Mein. Hubby didn't care for his Kung Pao, there didn't seem to be much chicken in the dish. I loved the light taste of the Moo Goo, it's a nice change from normal fried greasy style chinese. Will be back soon!

I came here on National "Pi" Day to get some of their pocket pies. Walking in I was a little overwhelmed because there was SO much to choose from. There people working were very nice & I was in & out in no time. I picked up 2 lemon pocket pies & a lemon bar. The lemon bar was nothing special, the filling was very dense. The pocket pies had a really yummy filling & the crust was great. If I'm in the area I will stop by to try some other items.

Since we moved here I've heard so many people talk about Dillon's & their onion rings. We finally bit the bullet & headed over there. I was surprised with how large it was inside. We were seated right away & started with their onion rings which are only $2. They were AMAZING! The breading was light & crispy without being overly greasy. I ordered the brisket plate with mac & cheese & mashed potatoes with brown gravy.  My mom ordered the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes & cole slaw. My brisket was very flavorful but pretty dry, the BBQ sauce was definitely needed. Mac & cheese was decent & the mashed was really good, I would just go for cream gravy instead of brown next time. The real superstar was the chicken fried chicken.  This is usually my go-to meal anytime a place has it, I literally search out chicken fried chicken when I go places. This was probably one of the best I have had. The batter was so crispy, just like the onion rings, the chicken was incredibly juicy & their gravy was definitely homemade, no powdered mixes here. Can't wait to come back again very soon!

Hands down my favorite restaurant EVER. Whenever we visit LV we eat here at least 2x. I have never had a bad meal or service here. The wait does get crazy long sometimes but it's worth it. Best chicken friend chicken I've ever had. Husband always gets their steak & beer special. Usually less than $20 for dinner for 2. Counting down the days until we visit again.

I am SO excited that we finally got to try this place! Since this was our first time the guy at the front explained everything to us & let us try some different items off the menu.  We got combo meals, mine was chicken fried rice, refried beans, teriyaki quesadilla & jade red chicken. Crazy amount of food. It was all SOOOOO good. My only complaint would be to ask for my fried rice without green onions as I don't really care for them & it had tons. Yes the place is divey but hey, the food rocks! $18 for 2 combo meals & a drink. They even brought us 2 yummy cookies!

I had a BBQ craving & Famous Dave's isn't too far so we decided to order take out.  I ordered a smoked chicken breast sandwich & my husband got pulled pork.  The sauce was GREAT but that's about it.  The meat was dry as could be & this was around 6:30pm so I'm not sure why it would be so dry, almost as if it was from lunch, yuck.  We were starving so I choked most of down, drowning it in the sauce.  I'm always on the hunt for good BBQ but this was just bad.  Maybe it was an off night, I'm not sure but for the prices, I'm not sure if we will be rushing back anytime soon.

Love this place! Baristas are so friendly & cheerful every time I come in. They are really fast in the drive thru as well which is a plus! I always get an iced Americano but their teas are great too. Prices are on point with the big green place across the street ;) Their smoothies & frozen drinks look yummy but I've yet to try those out. My new go-to coffee joint!

I came here with a good friend for a girls day.  The interior of this place is beautiful! They really paid attention to detail when designing this place.  I ordered a glass of red wine & my friend ordered moscato.  We decided to each other something different & then split.  I got the cake bite trio & she got the chocolate lava cake.  They were both good, but I think for the price we paid I was expecting it to really knock my socks off which it didn't. The service was amazing, the girls were so attentive & sweet, they get an extra star for that! I think when I come back it will be more for a special occasion due to the price.

Boba. My other obsession. This place was right around the corner from where we had dinner so I ran in. I can't believe how many flavors of drinks they had! Almost a little overwhelming. I stuck with an iced cappuccino milk tea with boba, at the checkout I saw they had coffee jelly which I had them add as well. Service was very quick & friendly. Drink was awesome! I loved the coffee jelly! Can't wait to try some other flavors.

This place is adorable! My husband & I both ordered cheeseburgers, 1 order of fries & onion rings to split. The onion rings & fries were soooo good, the burger was good as well, just nothing to write home about.  Prices were great, they even have $.99 root-beer floats. Servers were very friendly. It's pretty small inside but plenty of seating outside as well as a drive-thru if you're looking to get it to-go.

Tons of vendors here! I loved it. Everyone was very friendly & there weren't any lines like some of the other markets.  This was our first time at this market so we walked around the park afterwards which was so nice! I'll be coming to this market more often!

Love Whole Foods! Although some things can be pretty pricy, they always have fun new products that you usually can't get other places.  I was excited to see they had Sweet Republic ice cream inside with tons of flavors which I've been wanting to try for ages. They also had a very large macaron selection.  I could spend hours in this store just walking around checking everything out!

I haven't been to a Jason's in years & I've never really been a fan.  My mom was in town & loves it there, so of course being the awesome daughter I am, we went.    It was a little confusing when we first walked in.  We couldn't find exactly where we order, most places usually have a "Order Here" or "Pick Up Here" kinda signage.  Girl behind the counter saw we were confused & directed us to the right area.  Mom got salad bar, she loved it, I got a chicken panini with chicken pot pie soup which was so good, hubby got a salmon sandwich. We all really enjoyed our meals.  I plan on going back for a big cup of that soup! I can't stop thinking about it!

Came here with my husband for Hanukkah dinner, figured lines would be extremely long but we were very surprised to be seated right away.  We both ordered the 2 Jewish Sliders with the matzoh ball soup. They were SO good but insanely messy.  The bread did start to get a little soggy from the gravy by the time I started on the 2nd one.  I think next time I will order with gravy on the side.  Lots of food & prices were pretty on point with most delis.  We ordered some rainbow cookies to go which were DELISH! Can't wait to go back & try some more of their specials.

Hubby wanted street tacos & this was recommended by a few people.  We walked in at noon right as they opened & it was already packed.  They had a salsa/condiment bar right in the middle of the room which kinda skeeved me out since so many people we're standing around it (flipping their hair, coughing etc).  I ordered 2 carne asada tacos & hubby ordered 1 carne asada, 1 pastor, & 1 taco with carne & green chile. They came out right away & I was really impressed with the amount of meat they gave us.  My meat was pretty pink & I wasn't sure if it was due to a marinade or being undercooked? The meat was pretty flavorful, I did like that nice smokey taste from the grill. I could only eat 1 taco, it was way too greasy for me.  The tortilla was greasy as was the meat.  My husband devoured his & couldn't stop talking about how these tasted like the ones back in Mexico. I felt pretty queasy the rest of the day from the amount of grease.  Since my husband loved it I know we'll be back, I noticed they had bean tostadas & bean tacos so I may try that next time.

Wow! Another lesson of not judging a book by its cover.  This place is very small, only 2- 4 tops & about 3 - 2 tops. We stopped in around 5pm & there was another couple in there, they could tell it was our first time so they were raving about all their favorite items.  Our server came by & started us out with water & some bread.  Their prices were really affordable, the server explained that the smallest size of pizza can actually feed 2 people ($8!) we decided to split a Margherita pizza so we could save room for their Tiramisu.  Our server & the couple dining in told us that everything is made from scratch.  Our pizza came out & it was fabulous! So flavorful & had the perfect amount of crunch & doughy goodness in each bite.  Tiramisu was so fresh & delicious.  Our total came out to $15! We can't wait to come back & try some of their pasta dishes soon. Thank you fellow Yelpers for leading us here!!

Came here during lunch & were seated right away.  It was pretty busy but our server got our drink order right away.  We took some time to look at the pretty large menu & decided on getting something off of the lunch menu. I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken & hubby ordered Buffalo Wings.  Food came out quickly & piping hot.  My chicken breast was delicious but very small, which I guess isn't a bad thing since it's just lunch.  The country gravy served with the chicken is delicious & their shoestring french fries are so crispy & flavorful! I think I could make a meal out of their fries & gravy, actually! We decided to try their pizookie sampler & chose peanut butter, oreo & salted caramel. Omg. I'm salivating thinking about those little pizza pans of awesomeness.  They were warm & oh so delicious. PB was our favorite :)  When it was time to pay my husband realized he left his wallet at home, no biggie, I have mine...wait (digs thru purse)...no...no I don't. Crap. So we're sitting there & my husband says he will go all the way home & get it.  Luckily, I glanced over at the little BJ Rewards sign at our table & noticed it says that if you sign up for their rewards program you can pay your bill with your phone! Whoa. Talk about perfect.  So we did & thank goodness because I really wasn't looking forward to sitting at the table awkwardly while my husband went back home ;)  We'll definitely be back for dinner & drinks because their beer & drink menu looked pretty neat!

I'm so glad Yelp brought us together, Lamar's! We complete each other.  Soo, I love donuts. Like, LOVE LOVE LOVE them. So much. There's 1 place by my house that is just okay so we decided to go for a little drive to Lamar's.  It was about 10am on a Sunday & the place was packed, but luckily for us, so were the cases! Yay! The line moved crazy fast & I kinda panicked & just quickly threw out some flavors & she boxed them up. We tried a glazed maple, orange glazed, lemon glazed & a chocolate glazed.  I guess I didn't realize how big these babies really are! When we got home, okay, I'm lying...when I got to the car I ate the lemon one & it was pure donut bliss! Mmmmmmm! So fluffy & fresh. I may or may not of also eaten the maple one before I made it home.  They were THAT good.

I guess I'm just spoiled from living in New Mexico my whole life (best mexican food EVER).  This place had been recommended to me by pretty much everyone when I told them I was looking for NM style Mexican food. We finally made it here & I was stoked! The girl behind the counter kept answering the phone while we were ordering, another worker was walking past us cursing at another employee...awwwwwkward. Now I'm willing to look past all of that IF the food is good, sadly disappointed doesn't even begin to cover it.    I ordered a carne asada chimichanga & my husband ordered the chorizo & potato combo plate.  The food came out quickly & my husband couldn't figure out what he was looking at on his plate.  It was just ground beef on top of mashed potatoes. Every place he's ever been has served it with fried potatoes & actual chorizo. Is this normal for AZ?  He didn't even want to eat it the food was so bland. I cut into my chimi & couldn't believe the meat that was coming out of it...boiled dry hamburger meat.  This was absolutely not carne asada. I gave it a shot thinking that at least if it's flavorful it won't matter. Nope. Bland, dry absolutely NO flavor. The guacamole on top was great & the tortilla wasn't heavy from being fried, it was nice & light.  But what's a chimi without yummy fillings?! I couldn't even finish it, we both had weird artificial aftertastes in our mouths as we were leaving. Blech. Sorry, but this is a huge "never again" for me.

This is the perfect lesson of not judging a book by its cover.  It's at the end of a ghost-town strip mall & I honestly thought this would be a typical divey Chinese restaurant.  WRONG! We walked in & were totally surprised by how "restaurant-y" (that's not a word, I know) it was! They had fountains & beautiful booths, the decor wasn't crazy cheesy either. We were seated right away by our friendly server.    I ordered the almond chicken with steamed rice & hubby ordered sweet & sour chicken with fried rice.  She dropped off 2 bowls of egg drop soup which was actually very tasty.  Our food came next & we were really happy with it. Perfect amount for lunch, it came with 2 won-tons, an egg roll & the rice.  Our dishes were pretty basic so it's kind of hard to mess them up but we will be back here again.  They were really flavorful & didn't taste like it was loaded with salt like some Chinese places do. The lunch prices were great too (around $6 per person I think).

Was in the mood for Oasis but they were closed so we came here.  The decor is really cute & almost seemed out of place for the strip mall setting.  They had so many flavors that I didn't even know where to begin.  I ordered half peanut butter and half salted caramel. Hubby got banana which he couldn't stop raving about. Mine was amazing, they were really fresh tasting & the flavors tasted exactly how you would expect.  Loved all the fresh fruits they used to decorate the gelato in the cases, so cute!

Reasons why I love this market:   It's close to my house It's not on a Saturday morning Vendors are always so friendly It's never crowded  Compared to other markets, there aren't many vendors.  It works for me because it has the basics I always get: fresh herbs, eggs, tea & tamales. I'd love to see more produce but all in all, I think this is a really great little market.

I can't believe I haven't come here to do a review on this place yet! This is one of my favorite cupcake places! My faves are S'mores, Pineapple & Lemon! The pineapple has real pineapple at the bottom & the s'mores has a graham cracker bottom with marshmallow filling! Get in my belly! They are always fresh & the flavors seem to change.  LOVE Sweet Daddy's! My only complaint would be that they don't offer the s'mores cupcake more often which makes my heart sad but my waist happy.

I called here one morning because my dog got into the trash, they got me in that afternoon.  No one was up front when I came in & sat for quite a while before I was greeted.  When I was taken back to the exam room I waited for about 30 min for the tech to come get the paper work I filled out for my dogs. When the Dr. finally came to the room she was very friendly & came up with a treatment plan right away. The Dr. & the tech were knowledgable & answered all of my questions.  I was given a few different options & was shown different pricing so I could choose, which I really liked having that option instead of just being hit with a large bill. They were very sweet but it took almost 2 hours from walking in to walking out. Maybe they were just short staffed that day? They called the next day to check on my baby as well as sent me magnets of my fur babies pictures! LOVED that! It was a very neat touch. All in all, I would recommend this vet, I just wish the wait time was shorter.

I had been looking forward to coming here since I moved from New Mexico.  I saw all the reviews & I just KNEW it would be like I was back home. I ordered the green chile chicken burrito enchilada style & guacamole & my husband ordered the eggs & chorizo plate.  The sauce was so vinegary tasting & was loaded with cilantro, very bitter, so I was just eating the meat out of the burrito which was VERY tasty! At this point I was pretty bummed since I could tell this wasn't green chile that was used at all, halfway through I'm cutting into the tortilla to get the chicken out & I found a hair inside of it. They were very sweet & refunded my money as well as offered to make me something else but at that point I had lost my appetite. I know things like this happen but it still doesn't make it any less icky for me. My husband loved his meal so he will probably be back, but I can't say that I will.  Update 4/11/14 So the refund that the girl behind the counter was supposed to do was never done & it's been almost a month. Yeah, I'm def not going to be visiting this establishment again.

So unimpressed.  Restaurant was FREEZING inside & our server was much more worried about the tables of young guys than she was with getting our order.  We ordered burgers & chicken strips.  Chicken strips tasted like frozen Tyson strips. Burger was way over done. Never came to check on us & just dropped off the check.  Food was WAY overpriced for what it was. We will not be returning.

I have been itching to go here for the fresh noodles which seems like forever. I ordered the beef with oyster sauce with flat wide noodles, I was expecting a nice dark, flavorful sauce but it was light & pretty mild. I wouldn't order it again. Other people with me got beef & chicken stir fry which I tried & it was PHENOMENAL! I didn't care for the dumplings because it was basically just meat with the dumpling wrapper. I will be back soon for some chicken stir fry!

I've been craving BBQ for a very long time, saw the awesome reviews & made the drive over here.  Simple menu which I love, helps me narrow my decision down faster ;) I got the chicken sandwich with waffle fries & cornbread, hubby got pulled pork sandwich with waffle fries & macaroni salad.  These are definitely the kind of sandwiches you don't even need sauce on! So flavorful & tender.  Fries were fresh & very crispy but my cornbread was way too sweet, it was almost like dessert to me, eh no biggie.  We will definitely be coming back here soon to try some other meats!

Words can't even describe how glad I am I found Connie!  Having never left my fur-babies alone with anyone else but family I was sooo nervous. My dogs aren't the friendliest so I can't just leave them with anyone.  Connie came over to meet me & my babies, she was so friendly & immediately put me at ease.  She went over everything with me & answered every question I had (which I had tons, I'm THAT crazy annoying dog mom).  Each time she visited she sent me a picture & a little update of my girls.  She also does dog sitting in her home.  I stopped by her home to pick up my keys & we discussed options of my girls staying with her in the future or just coming by for some doggie day care. I'm so glad I found someone I feel comfortable to leave my babies with!

Holy toppings! This place has it going on! This is the first fro-yo place I've been to that has "bottoms" which are different toppings that actually go in your cup before you dispense fro-yo.  I went with a simple brownie, salted caramel fro-yo & nutella topping, then on the other side of my cup (yes, I divide my cup in half) oatmeal cookie fro yo & peanut butter sauce. SO good! Those toppings really can hike up the price here since they can be so heavy, they had varieties I've never seen in other shops. Very cool place. Also, the oatmeal cookie fro-yo was probably one of the best flavors I've had!

My FAVORITE place in LV to get macarons! They are affordable & delicious. They always have a really big selection of flavors to choose from. I've only tried one other cake item there so I can't really comment on their other items. Service is so great too, they are always so friendly.

Amazing teriyaki & katsu chicken! Hubby got the Loco Moco & he said it was just as amazing as from when we were in Hawaii. Their teriyaki sauce was phenomenal, I put it on top of the chicken katsu which was sooo perfectly crispy, they complimented each other so well. Can't wait to come back here.

Leaving my dentist back home of over 18 years made me VERY nervous.  Since I'm new to the area I came to trusty Yelp to help me find someone.  I called & the lady on the other end of the phone was so unbelievably sweet & answered all of my questions, she got me in within 2 days.  Upon my arrival I was greeted with such a warm welcome from all of the staff.  I was taken back & seen promptly. Dr. Wood was so friendly & warm & everyone helped with my uneasiness. They talked me thru every step & when I came back 2 weeks later for my filling the ladies at the front remembered me & greeted me with the same friendly, warm demeanor as before. I was very nervous & actually shaking but Dr. Wood & his staff once again calmed my nerves & made me feel at ease. I've only been here twice but the staff has all made me feel like I'm a long time patient! I even received a letter with a hand-written note from Dr. Wood thanking me for becoming his patient.  I'll be recommending them to EVERYONE!

Whoa! This place rocks. I tried the Red Starburst flavor ice topped with custard, tasted just like my fave starburst. Service was awesome, they were really helpful since it was my first time visiting. Can't wait to try their Cotton Candy flavor next.

There's nothing like good old fashioned ice cream! Churn has it DOWN! They had me at "toasted marshmallow topping." Be still my heart.  I ordered a scoop of PB ice cream with salted caramel & the marshmallow topping. So rich & delicious. They actually torch the homemade marshmallow right there! Awesome! You can tell their ice cream & toppings are made from quality ingredients. The only downfall is parking, it SUCKS! I will stick to coming here at random times & def not during lunch or dinner when the Windsor is packed.

Laura was AWESOME! I just recently moved here & saw her high rating on Yelp, even though it was about a 35 mile trip each way, I wanted to try her out.  I booked my appointment online which was super easy & received a text message reminder which was great.  Upon arrival she was SO warm & welcoming! I went bare faced (yuck!) so I was already a little nervous & uncomfortable but she put me at ease immediately.  Laura really knows what she's doing! She answered all my questions & gave me different tips to try to get my brows to grow out the way I'm wanting. I am so happy I found Laura!

I've been searching for some good quality olive oils & this came up while on Yelp.  Parking was easy, off to the side & the lady working was so sweet.  I told her this was my first time visiting so she explained the different oils & vinegars.  There's mini cups to sample everything.  I tried the espresso balsamic which was so amazing but I decided to go with just a plain balsamic since that's what I was needing.  I also got small sample (about 2oz, $5) of the organic garlic olive oil.  I'm actually regretting not getting a bigger bottle because this stuff is AMAZING! I think I'm going to be putting little bottles in everyone's stockings for Christmas, haha.     Prices were fair & there's so many different flavors to try, next time I'll be picking up the chipotle olive oil which I sampled & was great.

I used to be a HUGE In N Out freak...until I moved to Phoenix & now live by one.  I'm just kind of over it now.  We read an article talking about The Habit being similar to the other place but better.  The place itself is kind of small, not great for a big group & it can get very busy with no where to sit during peak times.  The workers are so helpful & actually seem happy to be working which is hard to find.  Prices were great! I LOVED that you could get an order of  1/2 fries &  1/2 onion rings.  The burgers are so fresh & flavorful & the fries/rings have always been hot & crispy.  I wish this was closer to us as I would definitely be frequenting The Habit MUCH more.

I was a little thrown off when we walked in at the size of the restaurant, it's MUCH smaller than I was imagining & the tables are pretty close together, not really the most intimate.  Who cares though when you can get amazing food at such an affordable price?! Our server brought out a few different types of bread to begin with as well as compliments of the chef which was filet with horseradish sauce.  Next was our palate cleanser & then out came our food. Hubby ordered NY strip medium rare with garlic mashed & asparagus, I ordered the filet medium rare with porcini mushroom sauce, garlic mash & asparagus.  My filet was HUGE! Super tender & very flavorful, the sauce was out of this world, I even needed another side halfway through my steak, don't judge me...since it was our anniversary they brought out some creme brûlée with berries.  All this for a grand total of...$43. Yep. Crazy cheap.

I usually come here for a boba fix.  I'm a huge coffee fan so it's nice that I can combine the two, most boba tea places don't have a huge selection of coffee drinks.  Service is always very friendly, although it can take a bit if there's quite a few people in line as I've only seen 1 person working at a time.  I LOVE their frozen coffee drinks, they aren't chunky & overly icey,  just smooth & delicious. They also have some pastries & desserts but I've never really been enticed to try any seeing as a coffee drink with boba already is like dessert ;)

Stumbled upon this after lunch one day.  The lady who took our order was very friendly & their menu was pretty interesting, I just went with an iced coffee & a shot of espresso over ice, it was $2.50 for both drinks, not bad at all.  The drinks came with a chocolate espresso bean on top of the lid, cute.  Next time I'm in the area I'll be stopping by again to try some other drinks out.

I'm usually not a fan of Einstein Brothers, I've tried them all over & they all are just "meh." Before taking my mom to the airport we decided to stop & have a bagel.  The guys (literally, all guys) behind the counter were so friendly & didn't get annoyed when it took us a minute to figure out what we wanted.  As we were leaving one of the workers was sitting down on his break, saw us leaving & jumped up to open the door for us, that doesn't happen many places anymore!

I'm pretty sure I've had better tasting microwaved TV dinners. Being our first time visiting a Paradise Bakery we were a little confused where we order, no one was around & we just kinda stood there at the wrong side, lost. Finally placed our order & by the time we sat down our food was being delivered. I ordered their steak & cheese panini & alfredo tortellini. Panini was okay for the first few bites but the rest was fat & grizzle. Yuck. Alfredo was nothing special, honestly reminded me of cafeteria food. The reason I added one extra star was because of their delicious iced tea & free cookies! Next.

This was my first time having someone come clean my home & being 9 months pregnant I desperately needed it! I also didn't want someone coming in spraying bleach & other strong abrasive cleaners everywhere...Eco Mama was a perfect fit.   There was a little bit of mix up on the time which the cleaners would be coming but I understand things happen. One girl showed up first & got to work, a little later a second showed up & they were whipping through the house getting it nice & clean! It was a nice day out so I spent most of the time out on the patio, when I walked inside the house I couldn't believe how AMAZING it smelt! No harsh chemical smell, just refreshing minty goodness. It took the girls about 2 hours to do a deep clean of my house. It looked great afterwards. They asked me to go through & see if there was anything else that I wanted done or if they missed anything. It was nice that they didn't just assume that was everything & leave. I was surprised at how clean my house really could be, I thought I was doing an alright job.    My only small qualm would be the floors had a kind of film on them & as soon as we walked on them it left shoe marks all over. But compared to how beautiful & clean the rest of the house was, it wasn't too big of a deal. I even purchased some of their Lavender Mint Bliss cleaner & have been hooked! We use it on everything.

SO glad I was able to get food from here instead of my usual muffin & crappy cup of coffee from Starbucks.  It was about 530am & they were extremely busy but very helpful.  I ordered an english muffin, a honey latte & some sea salt chocolate chip cookies to take to my family back home.  My order came out quickly & the english muffin was huge, very fluffy.  The star of the show was the honey latte...mmm. No bitter, burnt taste, just smooth yummy coffee! My family & I loved the chocolate chip cookies! I'm a sucker for anything salted! I will be visiting their other location to try out more of their food. Can't wait!

I've had this bookmarked for a while & a friend had told be about how delicious their cakes are.  I sent my husband & he read off a list of flavors for me over the phone, me thinking they are little tiny things I had him get me 3.  I couldn't believe how HUGE these were! It took me days to finish 1! If I remember correctly they were $4 a piece which isn't bad considering most cupcakes are around that price & their bundt cakes were much larger.  I tried Lemon, White Chocolate Raspberry & Pecan Praline. They were all amazing but the Pecan Praline really stood out.  Very moist cake & delicious cream cheese icing. YUM!

Best. Stuff. EVERRRRRR! I'm sad/glad this isn't closer to me. If it was I would literally be there every single day which isn't the best thing. I tried taro with condensed milk & boba, husband got strawberry with condensed milk & strawberries (lame) I was in heaven eating mine. Soooo creamy, sweet & delicious. I will be stopping in every single time I'm in the area.

OMG! Talk about STELLAR service! The guys were so awesome & seemed genuinely friendly, not just, "hi, I'm asking you how you are because I have to & I could really care less!" I had an iced caramelizer which was okay, I would've preferred a stronger coffee flavor. I will DEF venture back there to try some more of their drinks.

Came here strictly for drinks last night around 9pm, cute little western themed bar.  We sat down and the bartender greeted us right away.  We started out with some moonshine cocktails as we've never tried moonshine before, SO good. Watch out for the moonshine soaked blueberries, whoo wee those are like a shot of alcohol by themselves! They have a reverse happy hour that starts at 10pm so we stayed for that. Pretty chill environment to come have a few drinks & relax. Love it!

Came on a Sunday afternoon & this place was PACKED! I got their green raspberry tea with assorted jellies & my husband got their horchata milk tea. Both were soooo good! Service was a little slow due to how busy they were but I will def be back to try some more drinks. Menu was crazy huge!

FINALLY!   I FINALLY found some amazing NM style mexican food! This is the real deal here.  There's only a few tables & nothing is pre-made so each order takes a bit of time so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  I ordered the beef green chile burrito smothered with green chile & a side of guacamole, husband ordered a bean burrito & chips & salsa.  I was floored when I saw the size of our burritos but even more stoked when I took my first bite...AMAZING! So flavorful & delicious. These are not your normal burritos that you can just eat out of the foil, these are more like "fork & knife on a plate" kind of burritos.  They are jam packed with filling & ooze out of both ends. The guacamole was the perfect side for my burrito. I can't wait to come back & try their chimichangas, they looked deeeelish.  Only downfall, the hours stink! 11-5 & closed on Sunday & Mondays...boo!

I'm pretty much obsessed with this place. I ordered an iced cappuccino with boba. While I was waiting the owner was telling me about their popular drinks & even gave me a sample of their grass jelly. She was so sweet & so helpful. To top it off, it was probably one of the best boba drinks I've ever had! Can't wait to visit soon.

I called quite a few different places for quotes before deciding on Insectek.  They were the most thorough in explaining their process & the man I spoke with was really friendly & they were able to get me in the next day.   I had an appointment for 7:30am & the tech showed up right on time.  He was very friendly & went over things they found (ant hills etc) along with explaining the process of how their solution works. Each time the workers have been so respectful of my home & very knowledgeable in what they are doing. I feel at ease knowing they will come back in between sprayings if I find any more bugs for free!

Thank yooooou, Yelp!   Since moving to PHX I haven't had anything done to my hair (blaaaah) & I came on here to find someone who could do a really good cut as well as ombre color.  Shear Shack came up & I was able to make an appointment on her website which was awesome.  I arrived & Kristy was as sweet as could be.  I showed her a picture of what I wanted & discussed some concerns which she addressed & really helped put me at ease.  Kristy was so friendly & we chatted the whole time, I love that I wasn't just sitting there in an awkward silence which has happened at other places before. I felt like we were old friends.    She REALLY knows what she's doing! My color is great & I love my cut, it looks so healthy!  To top it off, her salon interior is AWESOME & totally retro! So glad I was able to find someone who was able to accomplish exactly what I was wanting.  I'm really looking forward to making another appointment again soon!

I'm totally bummed to have to give such a low rating.  The guy working the counter was so friendly (extra star for him) & I had really high hopes.  I was craving tacos so my husband & I decided to try this place, we've passed it going to Dutch Bro's often & had been wanting to visit.  I ordered 1 chicken taco & 1 steak taco, he ordered 1 pork & 1 steak.  It was almost $15 for our order, which I'd usually be more than happy to pay for good tacos but not for this size & the quality of these.  The meat was so dry in my husbands pork tacos that he couldn't even eat it, the steak tacos we both got were okay, meat was dried out, decent flavor but it was just coated in guacamole, that's all we were really getting in each bite.  Chicken taco was my absolute least favorite, no flavor at all & once again, super dry, I couldn't finish it.   I don't know if it was just an off night or what but I'm sad to say I don't think we will be coming back to find out.

Came here on a Friday night & sat outside. The server was really sweet & attentive.  I got the mac & cheese as well as their grown up iced tea.  Both were really really good! Nice place to have a few drinks & some food! Lots of TV's with the games going which my husband loved.

Probably the best donuts I've ever had!   Melissa R. told me about this place & as soon as she said "made fresh right in front of you" I HAD to try it out. You place your order for however many donuts you want, then you pick your icings & toppings.  I was a little overwhelmed at first because there were so many choices, there was a menu of some popular choices so I used that the help me decide. I ordered a lemon bar & a s'mores donut. They fry them right in front of you & serve them piping hot.  AMAZING!  They were so fluffy & delicious, the lemon bar was absolutely phenomenal, I have been thinking about that dang donut ever since we visited! The s'mores one was great to but the lemon stole the show.  Counting down until I visit again which I hope is extremely soon!

This is probably one of my favorite Sprouts. I have about 3 that are close-ish to me but I always find myself coming to this one.  The workers are so friendly, produce is always fresh & the shelves are always fully stocked.  I've never had a problem finding a parking spot either which that in itself will make me continue to frequent this location.

My new favorite bar! We were eating at the Texaz Grill & decided to come check it out one afternoon.  It's a super small bar with maybe 10-15 seats at the bar & then a few seats against the wall.  They have awesome little games like Connect 4, Rock 'Em Sock 'Em, Operation etc to play while throwing back a few.  The bartender was really sweet & since I'm not a beer drinker, she helped me pick out a beer to try. They really know their stuff! The bottles of beer & glasses of wine are $3 until 8pm, crazy awesome!   We really loved the vibe here, just a chill, no-frills place to enjoy some drinks, my kinda place.  Can't wait to come back.

Where have you been all my life, Waffle Crush?! I finally tracked them down & ordered myself the Mellow (nutella filled waffle topped with biscoff, toasted marshmallows & homemade whipped cream on the side).  This was so phenomenal! I'm almost glad they don't come to the WV often because it would be harmful to my waist & my wallet.   I saved some for the next day & it was just as amazing. Sigh, I'm dreaming of you now, Mellow!

FINALLY! Every time I noticed they were going to be in the west valley I always had something else going on, I was so excited to see they were going to be by my house alone with Waffle Crush (yay!) I ordered the Green Mile & fries, they were out of tots.  I guess halfway through our order they ran out of fries which was a bummer.  The burger was ammmmmaaaaaaaaaazzzzzzzziiiiiiiinnnnnnnnggggggg!!! I am obsessed with anything macaroni & cheese so this was the perfect combo! The mac was creamy, the bun was toasted perfectly & the meat was seasoned just right. LOVED IT!

Last fall my BFF surprised me with cake bites from The Sweet Tooth Fairy when she was visiting Salt Lake City.  I hadn't heard of them before but she was RAVING about them.  I had a mix of peanut butter, salted caramel, red velvet & I can't really remember the other flavors but I was in cake bite heaven with them! I'm not ashamed to say that I finished off the package she gave me in less than 2 days. I've dreamt of these delicious morsels since I last had them!  Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I was in Mesa & remembered reading that STF was opening up so I checked them out online & sure enough, they were open! Yay! The inside of this store is absolutely adorable, they even have milk on tap! The cases were full of cake bites, cookies & cupcakes. So much yummy in one spot.  I ordered some lemon, peanut butter, carrot cake & salted caramel cake bites to go. Lady behind the counter was so friendly & even gave us some samples of the cake bites.  They were just as amazing as I remembered them! I'm sad this location is so far from me because the treats are freaking amazing BUT on the other hand, my waistline is thanking them for not being close! :D

I truly could eat here every freaking day! No joke.   It's about a 45 min drive each way for me but I would drive that way multiple times a day if it meant I could get another sandwich!  This place is truly amazing & I've already been there 2 times this week.  Visiting the first time I was really overwhelmed with all of the choices but the guy behind the counter kinda walked us through everything & helped us pick the perfect sandwich.  The workers talked to us like we were old friends.  I ordered The Change which was sliced ribeye, BBQ sauce, onion rings & gouda cheese.  I can honestly say it was one of the most amazing sandwiches I've ever had.  Ever.  They are pretty pricy but worth every penny. LOVE all the different choices they have, you can go the healthy route or you can just go crazy (like I did) & even add mozzarella cheese sticks to a sandwich!    PLEASE OPEN ONE CLOSER TO ME! :(

I was very skeptical of hiring a doula (wasn't even 100% sure what they did) but when I reached out to Michelle at the end of my pregnancy I soon realized what an amazing choice I ended up making. Her positivity & bubbly personality filled the room & I felt like we were old friends. She always answered my numerous questions via text or call & was able to put my mind at ease each & every time (Google can drive a pregnant woman insane!) I ended up with quite a few bumps in the road at the very end of my pregnancy but Michelle was right there making sure I was taken care of & under as little stress as possible. She encapsulated my placenta & had it to me the day I was discharged from the hospital, it arrived in the cutest packaging ever! I honestly don't know what I would've done without the help of Michelle, she showed me that childbirth ISN'T a horrifying experience & what a beautiful thing it can truly be. I honestly can't recommend her enough!

This was my second time at a Freddy's, first was in CO so I was looking forward to trying their food again. We went to the drive-thru & the girl taking our order was patient & didn't make us feel rushed. She repeated our order back to us which I always appreciate, especially in a drive-thru. We waited a min or so & our food was ready. Our car smelt sooo good. My husband & I both ordered double cheeseburgers & split an order of fries. Their fries are AWESOME! Super thin, crispy & the perfect amount of seasoning. The burger was way too much for me. I'm not a huge fan of large meat patties & thought the singles would be skimpy which is why I ordered a double, next time I will def order a single. I could barely finish. The burger was very flavorful & tasted fresh. Their menu of ice cream treats was huge & I look forward to trying something off of the dessert menu in the future. Can't wait to come back for more fries :)

WOW! Their grand opening was today & I can't believe how smoothly everything went here! Workers were so friendly & helpful going over different popular items on the menu.  I really liked that they have a huge lit-up menu board outside so you're not just standing there holding up the line while you decide what you want.    The line was out the door but we were up to the front in no time, seriously, these people work FAST!  I ordered the BBQ Pork sandwich & half of a chicken caesar salad with their caramel creme brule AND their million dollar bar.  It was 50% off of everything today so hubby & I went a little crazy.  He ordered the turkey bacon avocado panini, half caesar, clam chowder AND 7 layer chocolate cake.  When we went up to pay & she told us it was $17 including drinks I couldn't believe it, there was sooooo much food! Their fountain drinks are really neat because they have a little section of different syrups to create your own Italian sodas.  Every meal comes with a slice of french bread & a chocolate covered strawberry which I thought is a neat little touch.   We absolutely loved our meals, I finished my sandwich & halfway through my salad I was stuffed! I took a bite of the creme brule & that would have to be my only disappointment item of the night.  It was more like a pudding, albeit a very tasty pudding!   Prices are VERY reasonable which makes my wallet happy, I foresee many lunches  in my future at Cafe Zupas!

For the west valley, this was a solid 4 stars. Donuts were fresh & flavorful. My major complaint was the lack of signage when you walk in about ordering. You just kinda walk in & wait until someone calls you over. It was confusing. It may just be because it's still so new & they are working out the kinks. Loved their big coffee selection. They also have a drive-thru window!

What a fun place to have close to home! Definitely more of a place to come for drinks, not to eat. We came on a Friday night & this place was packed! Luckily it's huge so we were seated right away. They had some awesome music playing, albeit loud, but we were here for a good time so it didn't bother us. I noticed they had $3 jaeger shots so we each started with those.  My husband ordered buffalo wings & I ordered the caesar salad foccacia wrap.  A few shots later our food came out. My husband loved his wings, my wrap was just meh.  Not much chicken & the fries that came with it were so soggy & greasy that they were inedible. Probably 2 stars for the food. I also ended the night with one of their $3 Zipparitas which was so unbelievably strong that my husband had to help me finish.  We will definitely be back soon, just not for food.  Their happy hours & reverse happy hours are awesome, something new every day of the week.

Dave came out promptly on a Saturday morning as we had been without heat.  He got to work quickly & unfortunately our heat magically started working right as he showed up so he wasn't really able to find out what was wrong. He changed out our thermostat & gave us his contact info if it started acting up again.  Overnight the heat went out, I emailed him Sunday morning & within a few minutes he called me saying he was in my area & would be by in about 20 minutes. We finally figured out what was causing the heat to keep turning off.  He was so personable & friendly, our rental company is how we found Yale Brothers but I will keep his information for friends & family...as well as for us when we purchase our place in town. Thank you so much!

If you want your fluffy gorgeous comforter to come back looking like a dingy, lumpy mess then take it here! The sign out front just says "CLEANERS" When bringing it in a guy clearly distracted by the soccer game was trying to get me out as quickly as he could so he could get back to watching.  When I showed him a stain I wanted removed he quickly brushed me off with "sure, sure. Come tomorrow." I should've grabbled my blanket & left right then.   The next day a young girl asked what my blanket looked like & if it was any laying by the door, I said no.  I showed her my ticket & she then asked me to look through the stack of blankets (WTH) I saw it at the bottom & she then handed me shirts that were on top. I explained the shirts weren't mine & she just shrugged it off & put them back. Not cool.  Once I got home I noticed taking it out of the bag it felt MUCH thinner. I set it on the bed to examine & sure enough all the filling was bunched together, color was completely off, stitching was frayed, there were extra stains that weren't there to begin with & it was as flat as could be.  We called & the girl said we would have to call after the weekend to talk to the manager. My husband went in & spoke with the manager who said he just followed the directions on the tag (riiiight) & that there wasn't anything he could do.  My husband told him that he should at least refund us the money of the cleaning which he finally agreed to.  Never taking my things here again! I will continue to make the drive to my usual place.

The new owner reached out to me & offered to make my negative experience a positive one. By this time I had already given up on the comforter so it was kind of a mess. I brought it in & the owner was as sweet as could be, I could tell he genuinely wanted to make it right. When I got it home I couldn't believe it was the same comforter! It looked beautiful & brand new! A stain that was left from the first owners cleaning was now gone! I am so impressed with the quality & professionalism from the new owners. We will definitely be taking our items here, so glad we tried them out again.

I've seen many chiropractors throughout my life & Dr. Ryan is hands down one of the best. He is extremely gentle during adjustments & really focuses on whole body wellness instead of just a "wham bam onto the next patient". He takes his time with you & is extremely knowledgable. I started bringing my 3 month old daughter to him, she was having lots of tension from having a lip & tongue tie revision when she was a few weeks old. She's a different baby! She's now able to roll over, lift her head & turn it side-to-side (all things she was unable to do prior to our visits with him). We were so impressed that I started care with him; my back & neck have been feeling GREAT!

When we moved to the area, we came from a small town with 1 old, always dirty, uncomfortable movie theater. This was freaking amazing! We'd never been to a theater with seats that recline & were so spacious.  I always avoided the movies back home because the seats were SO close to the next person, I felt claustrophobic. Not here, tons of comfy space without someone in "my bubble." I love that fact that you reserve seats ahead of time.  Sure, you pay more but it's soooo worth it.  I also just discovered that movies during the weekdays are only $5!   I can't imagine going to any other theater & enjoying it now that we've been to this one.
