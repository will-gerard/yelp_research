I have not lived here long but I have already had major issue with the quality of the appliances, the workmanship of the maintenance staff and the safety of mine and my child's well-being. When I moved in, there were safety issues with the locks on the apartment, the a/c units not working (despite being told that they were brand new units), the refrigerator not working (again-told it was a newer appliance), roaches in the apartment, neighbors being EXTREMELY loud at all hours of the night and the cost (& lack of quality) of the laundry facilities is insane. Really $1.40 per wash that takes 45 minutes and $1.05 to dry for almost an hour?!?!?! There are kids running around the complex and in the street at all hours of the night! They lack of parking space is incomprehensible. I would not suggest inviting guests over, since they will probably have to park at least a 10 minute walk from your apartment door. Someone attempted to break into my apartment in broad daylight and no one saw or did anything about it! Also, When I had the cable co. out to instal my internet service, they said they have to come out all the time to replace lines because this complex is known for having cable & internet lines cut and rerouted. I refuse to even let my child out of the apartment to play because I don't feel safe here!  ***In spite of everything listed above, the apartment manager has gone out of her way to make sure that I am in a place that I feel safe in. She has offered to transfer me to a different property with no penalty to break my lease. I understand that some of what I find wrong with these apartments are out of managements control and more or less show what is wrong with parents today.***

I took my 2003 Ford Escape here based on their awards and Yelp reviews. I have been screwed over by several mechanics because I am a young girl and they assume I don't know anything, or can't do research on my own. These guys were amazing! They were very honest and upfront about what was going to have to happen and how much it was going to cost. I am very please with their service and pricing.

I recently had to look for a new PCP and was recommended to this office by a coworker. I have to say, I absolutely love them!   They got me in super quickly and were so nice! I saw one of their nurse practitioners and I was able to get established, get back on medication from years prior and get blood work done all in just a few minutes.   I am the kind of person that hates going to the doctor and they made it super easy. I was able to do everything I needed to all in one office and being a single mom, it's important to me that people value my time and use it wisely. Super impressed!!!

Carter is amazing!   If I could give him more than 5 stars, it would happen in a heartbeat! My 3y/o and I were stranded with a dead starter tonight. He was about the 8th person I called, searching on here and Angie's list for a decent mechanic to come and save me. Now being a single mom, I usually do the majority of the saving but he was our Superman today! He drove across town (about 40 minutes) to come replace the starter in my car and was able to complete the repair in less than 40 minutes.   Not only did he take the extra time, that I know he didn't really have, to come to me but he did an amazing job in a short amount of time and it cost me a lot less than anyone else would have charged me. Words can not express my gratitude! I have never found anyone else more dedicated with more compassion in this field! Highly recommended!  **Thank you, Carter!**
