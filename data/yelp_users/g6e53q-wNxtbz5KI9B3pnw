I hate for my first official review to be a one star review but Macayo's really disappointed me last night. When I first pulled into the parking lot last night I was surprised to see how many empty parking spaces there were. I immediately got excited because normally any restaurant on Bell road any night of the week has a wait. However, when I walked inside I saw a slew of people waiting to be seated. I walked up to the hostess stand and put my name on the list and the hostess did not give me a time quote and when I asked how long it would be she quoted me, "not too long." We waited about 15 minutes before being shown to our table which is where the trouble really began.   Once we were at our table we were quickly greeted by our server (yay) however, she told us she had another table's drink order to get and then she would be back for ours (boo). So we waited for her to take the other two tables drink orders before coming back to take ours.   After about 10 minutes we got our fountain drinks and then 5 minutes later she came back to take our food order. Then it took about 50 minutes for our food to come out. Seriously, 50 minutes.... that's about how long I planned to spend at Macayo's not how long I planned on waiting for my appetizer of taquitos to take to come out. And to top it off we were missing a side of rice and a side of baja sauce. We decided not to mention it as we did not want to wait another hour for the two items to come out. So, after eating and waiting for our drinks to be refilled 3 times we finally got the check to which the server apologized for our wait. Apparently, she couldn't have apologized at all during our 50 minute minute wait she needed to wait until tip time.   I don't recommend going to Macayos. You might have better luck at any of the other 10 Mexican restaurants on Bell Road.

Love, love, love the doctors at this practice. I went to this practice until I was 18 and now that I've had kids I have brought them here as well. The office is nowhere near our house but it was a place I'd be willing to drive to because the doctors are so awesome. I'm not sure what has happened but the office staff has become exceptionally rude. I recently had a baby and was told to call back once I've added him to my insurance and then I was hung up on. Umm ok, he was added to my insurance. Then I called to make an appointment for a sick visit and when I requested to see a doctor and not a NP I was told to be there at a specific time but there would be a wait and I'd have to just wait it out. Then I got the snottiest goodbye I've ever heard in my life and the call disconnected. All loyalty to this practice is lost and I will not be referring any of my friends to this practice. In fact, I will be needing recommendations for a pediatrician in the NW valley...

Celebrity Tanning is a great tanning salon to go to in Glendale. It isn't too busy and you can normally get whatever kind of bed you want without having to wait for someone to finish tanning. Plus, they seem to change the bulbs in the beds pretty frequently. I got a great bronze color after a few days of having my membership! And, the best part is the girls who work in the salon are nice as opposed to the gum snapping, gossip talking, can't -be-bothered, super bitchy girls at some of the other salons. Yay for Celebrity Tanning!

I normally only venture here when Albertsons is out of something I need. On this particular day it was Easter Sunday and I needed marshmallow fluff. To be fair, I was already annoyed that I had to go to a second grocery store and was in a time crunch. In true Safeway fashion they had one lane open with a long line of people waiting. Evidently an express lane or self checkouts are a foreign concept here. Anyways, when it was my turn to get checked out I got to listen to the cashier (who was like 12) tell the bagger girl what an overrated holiday Easter is. Then they proceeded to discuss how hot it is to be tied up. I think Bashas is about to become my backup grocery store...

The employees are the rudest and most miserable people on the planet. Went through the drive thru and had to repeat my order several times and it was still wrong when I got it. I told the drive thru girl and she told me that next time I needed to place my entire order at the speaker box next time because they dont have time to correct or add things at the window. I then proceeded to tell her that I tried to order it but they got it wrong. She rolled her eyes, slammed the window, talked to some guy, opened the window, literally tossed my missing items at me and then refused to get the manager for me when I asked. Instead, she just slammed the window in my face again. Spend your money anywhere but here.

In a moment of weakness I did something today that I vowed I would never do and that my friends, was to eat at Lenny's. Every time I have been to Lenny's I encountered the rudest, most disgruntled employees one could imagine. It got so bad on my last visit that I posted about my experience on every outlet possible. I wanted everyone to know what a horrific place Lenny's was and encouraged everyone to avoid it at all costs. Even when the owner reached out to me to apologize I couldn't be bothered to respond because I was so irate. He assured me through Yelp that the issues would be resolved and that if I were to return I would leave a satisfied customer. I never thought in a million years that he could turn that place around or that I would return but the thought of that delicious fry sauce got me back there. And let me shout it from the rooftops, that man stayed true to his word. I was greeted promptly at the drive thru and was told they would be right with me. The girl who ended up taking my order was friendly and when there was a question about my order she kindly asked for clarification. When I got the window the girl smiled, said hello and thanked me several times. When I got my food and checked the bag I found that my order was correct. And just as the owner promised, I left Lenny's super happy. I don't know what he did to turn those employees around but whatever it was I am grateful. So for anyone out there who have been put off by the employees in the past, I encourage you to give Lenny's another chance. It's doubtful you're going to find a better tasting burger from a fast food joint.....  And to the owner, thank you for your original response and for staying true to your word. My apologies for never responding to you. I'll definitely be back!

Would be nice if you opened on time (or at all). Or at the very least change the hours of operation on Yelp (and the door) so people aren't driving across town only to find you're closed. Disappointing...

Karma is a gorgeous salon with a fantastic staff! The Alterna products sold there are the best. If you are looking for a great stylist I highly recommend Roger. He has totally transformed my look. Whether I want a short stacked bob or long extensions Roger works my weave. Roger not only does phenomenal extensions he also does one of the best straightening systems I've seen. Go see Roger, you won't be disappointed.

There is no better feeling than leaving the hair salon with amazing hair. Ladies, you know what I'm taking about, the kind of hair that makes people consistantly shower you with compliments and beg for your stylist's name and number. And I'm not just talking about the day you got your hairs did, I'm talking about everyday, up until the day of your next appointment. Oh wait, you probably have NO idea what I'm talking about unless you get your weave worked by Roger Montoya at R Salon....  Now if you're not a people person and don't want to be constantly approached by strangers asking who does your hair then stop reading! However, if you want some super sexy and on trend locks then go see Ro! I've been going to Roger for years. He's done everything to my hair from a Posh Spice bob (so technical, I know) to 18 inch extensions (2 months after said Posh bob when I decided I wanted the exact opposite) to the best ombre color (on said extensions) I've seen. Seriously, the blending is perfection and isn't Khloe Kardashian orange. Love Khloe but that copper color just wouldn't do with my complexion... Did I mention when I lived in Las Vegas and Seattle I flew to Phoenix every 6 weeks to have Roger do my hair? Seriously, cross-my-heart-hope-to-die, he's THAT good.  Bottom line, go see Roger and get the best hair of your life. He can do anything and do it better than anyone else. But try to avoid Friday afternoon appointments as that's when I go and I'm very high maintenance...

Slow, unorganized and filled to the brim with crazy people. I prefer to do everything through the service arizona website but recently got a letter that I needed to get a new license because my picture was going to expire. It makes total sense that my license is valid until I'm 65 but the picture expires after 11 years. Of course, the state charges a nominal fee of $12 to replace it. If the state of AZ was in need of my money I'd gladly just give it to them if it means avoiding this nightmare. Oh, and the camera is set to fat...

I can't recommend this place enough. My two year old cried when it was time to go. I sure wish this was my dentist's office.

This is the WORST DD ever! I'm fairly certain you have to be a miserable human being in order to get hired at this location. The staff does nothing but gossip and talk crap as you can hear it all when you place your order through the drive thru... You know, after you've repeated it half a dozen times.
