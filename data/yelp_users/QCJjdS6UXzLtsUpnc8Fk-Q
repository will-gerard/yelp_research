Annoying that their phone rang for twenty minutes and the restaurant seemed to be understaffed, but tasty milk tea and musaman curry/phad Thai! Will go again.

Yelp hours on Wednesday 20Nov2013 said open at 7am. Went there at 7:10am and it was closed, phone ringing inside. Went to Urban Picnic's website, no hours were posted, just the address in Mesa. The website re-routed to a Google Plus profile that stated it was open at 10:30am today!  Not sure what the hours actually are, but just a head's up to NOT go to this place in the morning if you're trying to find a new place :/
