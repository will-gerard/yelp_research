I recently started using Yelp and that's how I found Scottsdale BBQ.  I KNEW I should have listened to the bad reviews.  Seriously! Our order took 35 minutes longer than told when we phoned-in our pick up order.  Got it home, tried ONE bite of the ribs, beans, mac n cheese and burnt cookie and put the entire $30- meal in the trash (outside because it was disgusting).  I like to try small places and am all about helping neighborhood restaurants but this one is terrible.  Take a peek into the back and see how DIRTY their kitchen is.

Had lunch there today and loved it!  Delicious fresh food and the staff is super nice and down to earth.  We always had refills and never had to ask for anything-their service is great and I will definitly go to Pomo again soon!

If you're going for beer and sunshine, by all means, go. If you're looking for friendly, personable and helpful service and bartenders, there are TONS of other cool-vibe and delicious- casual friendly places to eat  (close by and in old town Scottsdale). Best thing on the menu is the cheese burger.-all their food tastes fresh. But to hang out, mingle, check out the dogs and enjoy the sunshine, you will wait forever for a drink, forever to get the bartender's attention...you begin to feel like a crank because you and your group starts to complain about the poor service--it's better to get drinks somewhere else OR get a table. Even when you have a table, the servers are super slow. I won't spend one more dime or hour of mine here ever again.

Planned our outing to Little Cleo's as a celebratory dinner. Made reservation and arrived early.  Stepped inside and immediately had issues communicating with the hostess, she didn't make eye contact and it was very hard to hear her because the noise level, like Culinary Dropout's locations, is ridiculously loud.  Upon sitting at the table closest to the door, which is the table 3 people ahead of us declined, the manager offered us a complimentary glass of wine for waiting.  You could tell the hostess and manager were not in-sync with each other.  Our very nice waiter showed-up and assumed we were ready to order, maybe because we had a glass of wine in front of us.  We asked for menus and then, as he came back, he asked if we wanted to order an appetizer...we hadn't even looked at the menu.   And this is where our dining experience began...and ended.  We ended up ordering on the fly, with little suggestion or direction from the server, he basically stood at our table as we quickly reviewed the menu and then told us he'd have to 'put in what we wanted' because things 'sell out.'  Pressure+no suggestions+not being able to talk amongst the others at the table to know what they're eating, made for an 'oh well, we'll see what comes out,' type of meal.  Although the food is always good at a Fox Concept, we won't ever go to Little Cleo's or Culinary Dropout again.  We won't recommend it to friends who visit either.  The food servers are inexperienced and the atmosphere is always unreasonably loud and rushed.  My recommendation to the managers at these locations is to talk with your servers about what makes a great dining experience.  How do we get our guests to spend more money and how do we get them to come back?  1. Ask questions and spend 3-4 minutes getting to know your table." How are you, have you been here before, welcome back, what brings you in tonight??" 2. Suggest a drink or a great glass of wine-- with an appetizer 3. Suggest meals that people can share and that might compliment their appetizer or other things at the table 4. Visit the table immediately after the meal is delivered by the expediter--Check to see things are cooked and to their liking. (we had to send back uncooked fish) 5. Ask the manager how we can make the restaurant a little less crazed and loud  It's not a bad thing to kneel down at the table or to find a way to get closer to who's ordering so we can hear you and you can hear us.

Food is good -- but pricy.  Chelsea's Kitchen is way better and a lot more comfortable...go there, it's just around the corner.  The chairs in the bar are super annoyingly loud. As I told a friend I went there, he said, "yea, the chairs in the bar are terrible!" Obnoxiously loud and so heavy for no reason.  1st time there I sat at the bar for dinner.  Nice bar tenders and very attentive.  2nd time there is when was for HH with 3 friends. We were waiting on the last 2 to arrive and ordered a bottle of wine in advance. Our server came to our table 4 times to take an order ---again, we're waiting on 2 more.  She offered to bring us bread but told us, "there's a charge...so I don't know if you would want it??..."  Totally awkward.  We ordered it anyway. Soon as our friends arrived, another server took over our table and asked if we wanted to order before the other two even had a glass of wine poured.---We felt rushed.  As we drank and ate, the server continuously came to our table, interrupting our conversation to ask if we wanted to order more...it was annoying; we had ordered 2 bottles of wine and 4 appetizers and bread...and all the while someone else was walking through the bar with a tablet on their wrist 'inventorying' the tables... It was so uncomfortable and not relaxing at all.  We won't go back.
