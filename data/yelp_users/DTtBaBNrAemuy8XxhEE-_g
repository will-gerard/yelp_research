The food was delicious and the service was great!  The private room the bridal shower held in was lovely.  However, I didn't like that they had a dress code; no jeans.  I can dress up a pair of jeans with heals, a really nice top and great accessories.  I think the pretentious attitude of "no jeans" is completely silly!

Food and service is excellent! Salsa is fresh and delicious and the guac is equally delicious with a hint of jalapeño. They must've included a bit of jalapeno in the fajita veggies in my chicken quesadillla because my mouth was craving milk.  Our server brought my hubby a free fried ice cream since it was his birthday. :)  They also have gave me 2 free dinners for buying over $30 in gift certificates.  We loved Jessie, our server!  However, they don't have jalapeño cream cheese and the women's bathroom is old and little gross.  Just go to the bathroom elsewhere.

The food is a bit too spicy for me.  If you like spice and can stand the heat, you'll want to try this restaurant (salsa, sauces,  green hatch chile, etc.).  Their white salsa tastes like a mix of spicy salsa a day thinned out white quest dip.  After two chips with this salsa, my mouth was on fire.   I love the chicken quesadillla!  I always request fajita veggies to be added.  Delicious and fresh!     This visit (1/13) I had the cheese enchiladas plate and it was great!  Although, the "mild" green sauce was not exaclty mild.  The cheese crisp was smaller than that of other Mexican restaurants and was not crispy (compared to restaurants like Rositas in Mesa or Nandos in Chandler). The guacamole wasn't my favorite.  Sopapillas with cinamon, sugar and honey are yum-my!  Service was attentive and friendly.

While we were circling Chandler Fashion, my husband called the Men's shoe department to see if they had a shoe in his size (Chuck Taylor's, size 14, black or grey).  The associate who took the call wouldn't even go check to see if they had the shoe in stock.  Instead, he immediately stated they didn't have any Chuck Taylor's in size 14.  So, I was frustrated, since we had bought many size 14 pairs from this Nordstrom in a selection of brands.  We felt they probably had the shoe and just were too lazy to check or weren't concerned by the little amount of commission they'd make on the $50 pair of shoes.  So minutes after the call, I went into the store, asked the men's shoe associate (Daniel B.) if they had any converse shoes in 14.  He asked what color, and I told him any color would do.  He went to go check, and brought out 2 pairs (black and white).  What do you know!  Look what a little effort can do!  I bought the black pair.  I left the store and called the store manager (Deb) to explain our less than stellar service.  She said all she could do was apologize for the bad experience.  I made a suggestion; she should discuss customer service with Daniel (or the gentleman) that answered our call.  All to say... if you are desperate for a pair of shoes, don't expect good service from this Nordstrom - go elsewhere!

The many downsides to this place, of which are the reasons I won't be returning.   They don't offer water to their patrons.   Cheesy elevator music is playing overhead.  Incense was burning and smelled gross!  The English spoken was very poor.   Their services are over-priced!  One of the nail technicians looked like he could be a pimp.   He was wearing a super tight black muscle shirt and a ridiculous gold chain with a huge jade Buddha displayed.   The nail tech cut my big two toenails really short and rounded them. My favorite nail place *always* asks which cut i prefer --square, rounded or square with rounded edges. They didn't ask, and since I was talking with my friend, I didn't get the chance to stop and tell the tech my preference.  So, I didn't get the look I was hoping for. My toes looked dumb.     Two upsides to this place:  They had fancy decor & a neat wall water feature!  Also, there were comfy newer massage chairs which massaged firmly.

Couldn't find shimmery blue or cream card stock or the type of ribbon (cream sheer 1/4" ribbon) we were looking for here today.  But they have so much of everything else.

Not only the best wings in the state - best wings I've had anywhere! Love the Golden Medium wings!! The chicken skewers are delicious with a little breading and flavor to boot! Yummy, yummy! Only gets 4 starts because I visited the Gilbert location during the summer and the AC wasn't working.  There wasn't a courtesy sign hung at the entrance to let patrons know and they could've at least paid for our sodas or a drink since we were sitting in an enclosed hot restaurant.   It was a hot environment and the manager was a bit short with us when we asked about the AC.  Otherwise, I live this restaurant.  The Gilbert location is the best.  Didn't like how obnoxiously loud the Chandler location (Ocotillo & AZ Ave.) was the last 2 times I've visited.

Love this place!  Incredible savings, quality products, affordable food at the food court, love the friendly associates and good service.  Bought a pair of Bebe glasses and loved the fit, style and price.  It took maybe 2 weeks to get them, but worth the wait for the pair I liked that was fit for my face.

I get massages done by Lyndee, & I love how I feel after them. She does amazing deep tissue massages!  She has strong hands and will work most all knots out.  I highly recommend booking an appointment with her.

Their Hot & Sour Soup is delicious and perfect for those "I'm sick and gotta have soup nights!" Egg rolls and crab puffs are to par, but the puffs come in bulk (10 quantity), so don't buy unless you have a few people to share with.   Their lunch specials are good values, but their dinner pricing seems to be overpriced.  Parking is typically cramped, thanks to the music business next door.

We ordered pepper jack sticks and they were surprisingly soggy.    The chicken caesar salad I had was yummy but the chicken was cold.    The pizza my hubby ordered (white pizza with crumbled sausage) looked good.  He said he really liked it but they used olive oil instead of alfredo sauce.  The crust was thin, crispy, and homemade.  He stated the best part about it was the cheese and sausage.  My mom-in-law had the fettucinnie alfredo and enjoyed it.

Have had *great* massages here, mainly by Carol, but todays massage was amazing! My therapist today was Aracelis.  This was the first time I had been to her. I had a maternity massage done, and it was relaxing and yet firm in working trigger points to assist in inducing labor naturally.  Her movements weren't sloppy, but fluid, just as I had hoped! She was friendly and made me feel comfortable. I wished Touch of Tranquility allowed for 2 hour maternity massages , because even though 2 hour was nice, extra time would have been the icing on the cake!  There is no doubt I will be going back to this gal for future massages again!

Liked the cheese crisp --it was truly crispy.  The salsa was fresh. The fajita quesadilla was amazing!  The quesadilla veggies were cooked just right, they used grilled chicken instead of pulled chicken and the jalapeño cream cheese was delicious!  Service was excellent.  Got there just after 10 PM for a late dinner date with my hubby, and they didn't hassle us for coming in at that time and ordering a full dinner, even with the restaurant closing at 11.  We were out the doors by 10:50.  Will go back again.  Margaritas aren't very strong and they're kind of a rip off.

Best tortillas ever!  Homemade deliciousness!  Forget the burrito or quesadilla ingredients, give me the tortilla!  Cheese enchilada was tasty, especially the sauce, but it was warm, not hot like I was expecting.  Bean & cheese burrito was bigger than expected.

They unstiched a sizing label from my nike pullover and without ruining it.  I'm not great at sewing, so even if this was a simple fix, it meant I didnt have to return it to Nike --which made me very happy!  The gal didn't charge me for unstiched the label.   She also told me I looked fine in my suit pants and no alterations needed to be made.  I appreciated her helpfulness and honesty.  I'll be returning to this shop for future alteration needs!

The hot stones weren't exactly hot. The leg and foot massage was relaxing.  The callous removal wasn't that good, as not much time was put towards scraping  my feet with the files.  There wasn't much of a kind customer oriented feel to the salon and techs.  The guy who gave my pedicure just pointed when he wanted my feet to move in or out of the water, etc.; he wouldn't give me direction by talking.  It was almost like he was mute, which is better than speaking in a foreign language, unlike the female nail techs.  The French pedicure didn't turn out as nice as I was hoping; the white lines were too thick, even after asking him to make them thinner.  A female tech had to come over and fix the lines. This is my first visit and now my only visit here.  So far, no affordable nail salon has measured up to Greenfield Nails (SW corner of Warner & Greenfield in Gilbert).  Greenfield closed early, which is why I had to come here.

Travis was super helpful and patient ad I was shopping with my new baby. He helped me get fit for a running shoe since my feet had grown from pregnancy.  He gave me options for possibly returning trail running shoes from pre-pregnancy state to the online store. Hoping since I haven't worn them I'll get the credit back.  The store had my size but in a geriatric looking shoe, not a cute running shoe. But luckily, the store can order the shoe I want in my size.

They are for the most part very kind and hospitable and they all speak English!  Their callous treatments are great.  They always have cold bottled water.  I often see the owner in the shop cleaning the foot spas and they take great pride in keeping thing as clean.  they take a while to do pedicures, which is very much appreciated, because I want it done right and want to feel relaxed.  The designs they draw are pretty good.  Besides having an awesome pedicure, and best of all, I like that I feel welcome and am able to relax.  I've been coming to this salon since they changed owners a while back (about 2 years or so).  They are usually busy, so appointments help but aren't necessary.  I don't go anywhere else. This place is great!

Tracy is the most hospitable, friendly uninterrupting waitress at the Chandler Chompies. Love this gal!  Will request her for future visits.  I ordered the strawberry pancakes with the whip cream and graham cracker crumbs.  But I made a request to get bananas and walnuts added, since the banana pancakes sounded good, too.  Tracy didn't bat an eye before saying the request wasn't a problem.  Can do attitude! No who doesn't appreciate that when you are teetering between two menu choices.  Thanks for making my morning!

This place was packed!  And there was a strangely placed hutch in the waiting room and also one in the back hallway.  Didn't make me feel anymore at home...  My nurse was so sweet and held my hand through my appointment.  That's exactly what I needed.  Thank you!

They make delicious deli sandwiches at great prices.  Perfect spot for lunch, as they have four two seater tables.

Service was very friendly and we only had to wait 2 minutes before being seated.  However, our food took a long time to come out as well as our check.  The hash browns were white, not cooked enough, and far from crispy.  They were gross and bland, but I ate some because I was hungry.  The English muffin was yummy.  The omlette was NOT tasty.  The ingredients weren't cooked into the egg, rather the egg was cooked, folded then the garden veggies and bacon were thrown in the middle without being cooked into the egg. I ate a bite off egg and had to gather the add-ins.  And the amount of bacon was way too much --about twice the amount of veggies!  I didnt like it and was not impressed!  I won't get another omlette from U.S. Egg.  If I come again, I'll stick with the pancakes or club sandwich.

First time to visit this restaurant.  Peculiar location...  Beautiful decor, and nicely maintained inside and out.  Although, the padding on our chairs look like they'd seen better days.  Also, we were a bit cold sitting under the new wall AC unit.  Nice bathrooms (unlike some other Mexican restaurants).    No hostess available, and after waiting a few minutes,  I went to look for someone to seat us.  The server said he'd be right with us.    We ordered iced tea and it tasted fresh brewed.  The queso, chips and salsa (red and green) were all very good.     Our dishes were brought out quickly --just before finishing our appetizer.  My chicken chimichanga was delicious and the plate presentation was nicely arranged with a radish as garnish.  My entree did have a bone in it, though.  Our server mentioned dessert, but we couldn't endulge as our lunch portion kept us satisfied.  We enjoyed the atmosphere (besides the cold air) and the food, and will return.

This place is a great locally owned sushi and teppanyaki spot.  It's mostly modern with a mom & pop down to earth flare.  The Las Vegas rolls never disappoint and they have a couple of signature rolls that are pretty good backups to my favorite (LV).  The chimichanga roll was sort of spicy while the chili cheese roll calls for a mouth fire extinguisher.  The servers, staff and owner are all friendly.  This restaurant is great like Benihana without the pretentiousness and extremely high prices.  However, they werent exactly adequately staffed during lunch (11:30), so don't plan on getting out of there in a rush.  Their lunch specials are good, but some of their rolls when not on special can be a tad costly.  Also, the water doesn't taste filtered, rather closer to hose water. Yuck! I hate when I have to order a soda because a restaurant has gross water.  Lastly, the server had a hard time understanding my request of spicy mayo. She asked me to repeat a few times and upon her request, I spelled it out for her.  Maybe there aren't many people that request it?  But, I love it!

Great service! Made suggestions about loaded potatoes, which interested my hubby for our next visit.  Like the environment, feels "homey," new and inviting, even though it's a chain restaurant.   It was busy at 9:45, had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  But not bad for a Satursay morning!    It was a bit humid in the restaurant.  If it wasn't cold outside, we would've sat out on the patio.  Although, they do have heaters on the patio. I ordered over-hard eggs, bacon and sausage.  Bacon wasn't crispy and the eggs could've been cooked longer so the yolk could be completely cooked. But to be fair, I didn't ask for crispy bacon.  Husband and niece loved their biscuits and gravy! Mother in law loved the sourdough bread, but thought the bacon was under-cooked.   Our waitress was nice to ask if we wanted cups to take our drinks to go.  Good server.  I liked this place and the food was pretty good.  We'll come back again.

Freeride Bike Co. is the best!  They customized my entire bike.  I think the chain guard and frame designs are my bike's best features!  They were custom designed (pinstriping) to match my basket liner.  My ultimate dream beach cruiser!  I'm VERY pleased with the finished product!  Get a new bike or your current bike customized by them! They rock!   #FreerideBikeCo #Mesa #BestLocalBikeShop #CompleteCustomization #AwesomeOwners

Finding this office in the centre it's located is a show!  Got there on time but spent 7 minutes trying to find the office.  There is more than one "buidling #3."  My 10:15 AM appointment was dwlayed by 45 minutes.  They took others without appointments that showed up after me the same time they took me back to draw my blood.  I asked the lady to not dig in my vein before she went in through my hand, but she did anyway.  Not the best patient care.  Getting blood drawn of course isn't fun, but it hurt worse than it should've.  The one thing I did appreciate it that the waiting room; it  looked clean, and offered plenty of seating.    They insisted on taking my credit card for future payment in case my insurance didn't cover the full bill.  I asked a second gal working and she said it wasn't a mandate, so I requested they get rid of my cc information,  which they obliged and shredded the info.  They also don't give you prior notice of the automatic debit/cc payment draw.    This place just wants to help themselves, not the patients they are serving.  But, my insurance covers me to visit here and I didn't have much of a choice for location.  Hoping I won't have to make another visit here!

They have a great selection of clothes for my hubby  --casual, date night and business casual.  The sales associates are friendly and helpful in pulling down the out of reach inventory.    A pushy obnoxious gentleman used to work at this location but transferred to the Las Vegas store. Glad he's no longer servicing this store!  Now we feel comfortable shopping here without his rude and unprofessional tactics bombarding us each time we visit.   Wish they had coupons available online for in store use. The coupons received by mail for spending a certain dollar amount seem to take a while to arrive and aren't used at our convenient shopping outings. So we end up spending buco bucks most times we shop here.  DXL should step up there discounts and coupons.

This inside of this place is beautiful. Walk-ins and appointments are welcome.  I came here with 4 family members (on 6/16) as one of them has been here before and chose this place to get our pedicures for our cousin's wedding this weekend. I obliged even though I love my normal nail salon- Greenfield Nails-- and didn't want to be the unwilling stick in the mud. I had the basic pedicure with a callus removal. The foot and calf massage was very nice.  HOWEVER... I did NOT appreciate waiting around for 45 minutes before they started on my pedicure.  They didn't say a word to me about being short staffed, running behind or, "hey we knew you had an appointment at 5:15 but we can't start on your feet until 6."  Nothing. Very very rude.  The rest of my party were worked on while I sat there just waiting. If I would've known they were going to make me wait so long, I wouldn't have put my feet in the pedi bowl; I would've said "Sayonara!" girls, off to MY nail place.  I will NEVER come back here because of the bad customer service!  I could careless about the cute interior-- customer service is King!  Oh, and the bags of trash sitting right in front of the entrance/ exit... smelly and tacky!!  2 Stars.

Hash browns were soft, few and weren't crispy.  Egg on my Texas toast breakfast sandwich did not taste real.  I think they were POWDERED EGGS No joke...  The eggs were gross -- I just threw them out.  My husband's iced tea was, "terrible and tasted like it was brewed with coffee."  They orgot I ordered a coffee and then didn't give me a stirrer so I could add my sugar to my coffee.  My husband asked for extra ham on his Bagel sandwich at the drive thru speaker,  and it didn't come with extra, even when he asked for it again at the window after realizing we weren't charged for it.  He had his card ready to pay, but they didn't take it.  The gal who was making his sandwiches looked ticked about my husband wanting extra ham on his sandwich when she handed him the bags.  Very rude...  My husband's plain bagel and cream cheese was the only good part about breakfast.    This was a BAD experience.  Not a good start to the weekend.  Won't be coming back here.  This place needs to figure it out!
