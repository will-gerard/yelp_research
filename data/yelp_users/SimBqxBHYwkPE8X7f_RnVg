Need a good auto repair place, this is it.   I have been using Terry's for over 8 years. I was introduced to Terry's Auto by a friend.  Since that time, I have used this place exclusively for my cars.   It is very tough to find an auto mechanic that you can trust.  With Terry's, I drop my car off, tell them what I need and walk out. I come back, usually by the end of the day, and he is done.  Fair price without a worry.   Have been taking my wifes 1997 Chrysler there for years. Have had new transmission, new sets of tires, and multiple other basic maintenance.  A vehicle that probably would not have lasted more than 100k miles is still running well at 150k plus miles.   Terry has even been kind enough to work with me on payments when I had transmission installed.   Can't promise he will do the same with you, but then, I have been going to him for 8 years.   Need a good mechanic, look no further...

Having grown up on muni golf courses, I constantly look for the best dollar value around.   I am a very active member of the Dobson Ranch Golf Association, this course has become home for me.   Dobson Ranch offers one of the best values in town. Not too mention a very well kept and quality municipal courses.  A challenging course that requires some accurate drives to avoid trees, some lenghty Par 3's when played at the tips, and some tough greens, you won't find a much better value.

This is located on the Dobson Ranch Golf Cource property.   A separate building from the main club house, it servces as the gathering point for all the golfers.  But it is also a complete restaurant.  They also do wedding events and other parties, but can't comment beyond that.   As a HUGE golfer, I have learned to never overlook the golf course restaurant as a place for good food. Especially breakfasts and lunches. Want a good burger, dog, fries, wings, or selection of breakfast items, don't overlook your local golf course restaurant.   The restaurant has recently been taken over by Lefty and his wife.  A nice couple who have been an integral part of Dobson Ranch for many years.  Now, they run the restaurant under contract from the City of Mesa.  I don't frequent the restaurant part, as I end of spending most of my time in the bar area.  As a member of the Dobson Ranch Men's Club, this bar area serves as the gathering point for the men's club golfers before and after rounds.   The breakfast menu offers a variety of food. I have especially enjoyed the large stack of pancakes.  This is one of the best places I have found in the valley for pancakes. Forget I-Hop, Village Inn or the other chains, I would go here for breakfast over most other places.   Also on the menu for breakfast are stuffed French Toast.  French Toast filled with cream cheese filling.  Will probably be my next tasting...  Have also had the hamburgers, wings and dogs for food during my many visits. Friday, had a club sandwich with fries in a to-go box on my way to out for a round of golf.  Now I will admit I was very hungry, but these were some of the best fries I have had in some time.   Located just south of Baseline on Dobson Road in the Dobson Ranch Golf Course, if you are looking for a breakfast without any lines or waiting, stop by... I think you will find a new hidden gem for breakfast...  Only downside, it is a little more pricey than the usual.  But I think it is well worth it!!

Salad and wing night!!  I had a renewed enjoyment of Native New Yorker at this location.   Enjoyed a huge Cobb Salad and wings. Unlike some other locations I have visited, the winds were not drenched in sauce.  Came out hot and were a perfect match to my salad.   Read other reviews about the location. I would agree that it is not a shiny new location. The tables did have a stickiness to them that was not pleasant. But I think it as the surface of the table and not a cleanliness issue.   Waiter was attentive. Kept my drink filled.   The food was exactly what I was looking for at that moment.

I love this place.   People watching is great.  Wal-Mart meet Kmart in people.   It is outside, so winter time is the best. That is also when all the vendors are there.   Four very long rows of nothing but "swap meet" type of merchandise.  There are some good deals to be found. Last years electronic toys.  All kinds of t-shirts, sweatshirts.  Many jewelry items.   Overall, just a great place to spend a few hours wandering. Not too mention the exercise you get!!

Visited 8/17/12.  I have been here several times so once again I am surprised I have no reviews.   This is probably the better of the Mexican Restaurants I have come across.  Great selections, endless chips and salsa, nice appetizers.    This place is always busy!!  Always..  Be prepared for a wait or get there early.   They also have nice selections for tequila and margaritas.  Although the tequila prices are a little high for me.    This last visit, I as a little disappointed in the margaritas... I think a little more tequila is appropriate.  If I am paying $9.00 for a Margarita, I had better be able to taste the tequila.

If you live in Queen Creek/San Tan Valley area, why would you ever buy your pork from the local grocery store.   This is truly Pork Heaven.   They offer any pork you could ever want. From ribs, to chops, to bacon, to brauts, to sausages.  Perhaps the best is the stuffed loin roast wrapped in bacon.  Put it in the oven for 30-45 mintues and pull out a roast that melts in your mouth.  If you happen to be lucky enough to go there on a Saturday when they are offering dollar brauts, you can have a snack before you get on the road again.  October they offer dollar brauts every Saturday.  And now found out they offer the same every Saturday in March.  Too bad I didn't find out until just this weekend!!!  If you go on a dollar braut day, plan on standing in line for a few minutes.  Many others have found this secret.  The short wait is worth it.    While your there, don't hesitate to try the samples they set out too.   It's not really a restaurant. So if you are going there thinking that you can get food, forget it.  But on special times you can get brauts. And they always offer green chile burritos.    If you are not local, come down anyway. Bring your cooler and stock up.  You will never get better quality pork products in the grocery store.  Don't forget to try their custom sausages.  Can't wait for October and dollar brauts again!!!

I have been twice now.  Both times I went in looking for good wings.  Both times I walked out disappointed.   I had the boneless both times.  The chicken is lost in the heavy breading.  Very dry.   I do like their options for various flavors.  The Mango Habanero is excellent.  Also like that they offer a dry season.   But if I am looking for good wings or boneless in this case, there are some other places I will look first.   Great for football viewing.  Also they offer UFC fights.  Also nice selections of beer.

Visited 6/2/12....  So..... My quest for good BBQ in Arizona continues!!  We actually took the time to drive across down just to visit this location.  My friend recommended it based on prior experiences from years ago.  And also because it made Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Our hope was to find a better experience than our weekend prior.   We were very disappointed!!  I had the meat combo.  It is a sampler of all the meats.  Brisket, Pulled Pork, Chicken pulled, Ribs - both Beef and Pork, Ham, and Chopped (a mix of chopped pork and ham?)  The meat had no appetizing appearance.  The taste was not much better.  The meat was dry on top and dry through out.   Ribs over cooked as the meat on pork ribs were falling off the bone. The available sauce on the table was basic. And when I asked for a hotter version of the BBQ sauce, I was brought another bottle that came cold (like out of the refrigerator) and it was not very spicy - even for my friend.   The sides were disappointing.  The Baked Beans tasted much like they came out of a can.  The Cole Slaw was bad - like it went bad.  Tasted sour and bitter.  So bad that I sent it back..  The only good thing were the Onion Rings.  These were very crispy and fresh.    We went in about an hour before closing.  There were very few people there.  But service was slow.  Took about 15 minutes just for the Onion Rings.  And another 15 minutes for the main dishes  Considering this is a BBQ meat that is supposedly slow cooking for hours, it seems like it would not take very long to prepare.  Unless you have to go back and reheat??  (Just thinking out loud here.)  Over all this was a failure.  A wasted hour drive for BBQ that would have been better at some local chain locations.   Maybe it was because we arrived close to the closing hour?  But then again, if you seat me, then serve me a good dish.  Otherwise, don't serve me!!  Finally, would I return??  Maybe? For lunch and a quick sandwich.  Will I ever drive that far again.  NO.  Are there other choices in this area, YES.

In town for business trip as my  home office is located in Madison. With a small group of co-workers and decided to go downtown.   We walked the main street going toward campus.  Once we reached the end, turned back and came across this bar.  It was either this or 5 Guys Burgers. Given my poor experience with 5 Guys in Phoenis, I opted for this location.  Besides, brauts in Wisconsin??? You have to give it a try.   I had the Burger/Braut.  Pretty much a plain burger with a braut cut in half on top.  Others had the Hot Braut and one of the salads.   In general, food was just a little less than average. I can cook brauts better on my own grill using brauts from a better local pork shop.   The atmosphere is a different story.  First understand that we were there at 7 p.m. on a Monday night when college is pretty much out.  But this place had a nice set up of T.V.'s, and tables.  This location would make a great place to sit and watch a game. And I can only imagine what it would be like on a Saturday before/during/after a local college football game.   Also had the chance to try two local brews.  Had the Glauser (sp?).  Nice local brew.  There were several other options of beer and full bar.   If I ever get back to this place, will have to try it on a Friday or Saturday night.    But if you are looking for something good to eat, well, keep walking!!!

Here for live John Denver tribute by my sister's boyfriend. Looking forward to the music!!  Ron Matthews put on a very good performance.   This is a small little bar. Probably not a location I would look to go to on a regular basis but for this special event.  However, I can see where this would be a local watering hole for the locals around the area.   I was disappointed that the menu was a limited menu because of the event.  So I was only able to have a Cheeseburger.  Nothing special.   The music and performance was great.  But not a bar I would tend to visit otherwise.

Visited 11/3/13.  I have seen this restaurant show up on Yelp prior but never had the chance to go.  Looking for breakfast place and we were in the area.   This is a nice "Cafe style" restaurant.  Located just off the runway and parking area for the planes at Chandler Airport.   The menu is very much a Cafe type of menu with nice comfort food.  Breakfast and Brunch is the way it appears on Yelp.   This is a keeper. Nice hole in the wall.    They were very busy but we only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Maybe the only complaint is that there is no shaded areas for waiting. Lucky it was Fall and not summer. But if we had come 45 minutes later, about 12:30, probably would not have had to wait at all.  We both had breakfast burritos.  I had the Airport Burrito. Loaded with pieces of chicken fried steak, hash browns and egg. Covered with a good sausage gravy. (Maybe one of the better sausage gravy's I have had in while.) Girlfriend ordered the Hanger Burrito which had beef, beans and egg. Covered with a Green Chili sauce which was also very good.   Service was quick.  Food was good.   Review of menu also shows some nice sandwich selections.   This will be a regular at this point if we can remember it is there when we are in the area.

What a nice little restaurant.  Located right on Scottsdale Road in Old Town, this location offers a nice little Italian opportunity.   The restaurant reminds me very much like a neighborhood restaurant.  There were many at the bar that would appear to be regulars enjoying the happy hour and games on television.  But other seating options offer a nice choice from a quiet booth to window seating that looks out toward the street.  Although too hot to open the doors, I am sure that they would open them during cooler times.   Meals included the Sea Bass with Spinach Ravioli.  Very good.  Other reviews comment that it melts in your mouth and they are correct.  My friend had the Veal Sorrentino which looked amazing.  Desserts are limited.  We had the Tiramisu and Chocolate Chip Cannoli, but very good.   Wine list is limited, but the selection is good and pricing is very reasonable by the bottle.   It will be slightly pricier than your chain restaurant, but it offered a very nice experieince for an extended evening meal and conversation.  Amazingly, it was not very busy and we were able to enjoy an extended dinner and conversation without feeling that we needed to rush out.   Would recommend it and will definately keep it in mind for a nice change.   4 Stars only because there really needs to be something special for me to award the 5th Star.  Probably just missed it tonight though!!

Went on Friday, 4/27/12.  Jim Belushi and the Chicago Improv Group.   They were very good.  Thoroughly enjoyed the show.  Great improv comedy.  I am sure Jim Belushi involved only because his son is one of the members of the group. But still very good.   The opening act who is their regular was also very funny.   Like any comedy club, two drink minimum.  And the mark up on drinks is more than a regular bar.  But that is expected.  Did not try any food so cannot comment on menu at this point.   Was a little disappointed in seating arrangements.  Long tables that run the wrong direction.  Every one has to turn their head left or right to watch the stage.  Or try to rearrange the chair in very tight space.  The should really rethink the table arrangements.   Will go back for a good attraction.

5/7/12... I have to make a correction to my review as I received communication from someone with the club..   I was informed that they are not like other clubs as they have a "Two Item" minimum, not a two drink minimum.   So you can order a food dish and a drink to meet that minimum.  And I did confirm that one in our group ordered a bottled water which counted toward his minimum.  So I stand corrected.

I have heard about this location many times in speaking with friends, but never had the chance to go.   Happened to attend with buddies after finishing round of golf and Cave Creek.  Was surprised to find that is just up the street.  And now wish I had found this location before.  When we walked in the door, we were lined up but a person who let us taste the different meats.  Enjoyed the Jerk Fried Rice and Jade Chicken. Only had the bowl. Will order in a burrito next time.   I would never stop in this place given location and that it is a hole in the wall.  But having heard about and now having experienced, this could be a regular stop after golf on weekends.   Cannot wait to try the location in Chandler.

Visited 5/30/12...  This is a gem that is tucked away at the Southwest corner of Alma School and 60.  In the same parking lot as Chicago Pizza.    Went for a brunch.  Figured it would have cleared out but Noon.  Nope.  Still line to get in.   Had a skillet menu with a pancake.  Everthing tasted great.  Pancake was huge.   Not sure why I have not been here before??  But will definately return.

A very good transitional Mexican Food.  Unfortunately, the area of town does not have the best of reputations, however, if you get beyond that, the food is good.   Fresh salsa and warm chips, unlimited.   I ordered the carnitas chimi.  Would have preferred that it come smothered, but I am sure it can be ordered that way.  I also had the Chili Relleno.  Was not very impressed with this dish as the chili was very small and got lost in the egg.   Friend had chicken enchilada and taco.  She enjoyed this as well.   4 stars only because a place has to really stand out to get that fifth star.  I would definitely return if I am on this side of town.  Next time, maybe try a special margarita too!

Visted 5/6/12...  I have been to Oregano's many times.  Another one of those places that I just never got around to writing about I guess.   My favorite is the Chicken Pesto Pizza.  That is my regular when I go here.  But there are many food options.   There are several across the valley and I have been to many.  I have not had a bad experience at any of them.  They tend to be very busy, so be prepard to wait 15-20 to get a table.  We were there about 4:30 on Sunday and there was already the beginning of a line.   This time, had an exceptional experience.  We had finished an order of the Stuffed Mushrooms, huge portabellos with sausage, a side salad, and were almost half way through our pizze (Chicken Pesto of course) when the manager brought out a second pizza.  He told us that when he walked by, he did not like how our first one looked, so he made us a second one.  I never noticed a problem with the first.  Bonus leftover food as a result.    Nice to know there is some quality control behind the scenes.   Oregano's will always be a go to place for me.

Went out with wife and dog today to this park. We love this place. I can let the dog off the leash and let her play. Being a black lab, she heads straight for the water and never leaves.   This park is not the cleanest. And yes, for some reason, pet owners don't seem to clean up after their dog. REALLY, how hard is it. Grab a little plastic bag, wrap it over your hand, bend down, pick up dog poop, pull back over hand, and throw away. While your bending over, try picking up one other pile while your at it. If you use the "1 +" rule, the park would be clean all the time.   But my biggest complaint, as are most of my complaints about places, are the humans. It amazes me how some of the most rude, most inconsiderate, thoughtless people bring their pets there. Or the fact that they have dogs all together. Combine those with the people who think that this is a play place for their children also, you can only imagine the comedy of people and errors that can develop.   Been a life long dog owner I have several rules about dog parks. Thought I would share:   First --- DOG PARK!!!!!  This is a place for your dog!!! If you bring your children, expect that they will get dirty, knocked over, run into, jumped on, wet, and anything else that can happen when allowing dogs to run freely.   This is not a kid park!!! There are any number of other places kids can go to play on the equipment. The obstacles, jumping ramp and all other things in this park are for the DOGS!!!!!   If you can't control your kid, PUT IT ON A LEASH!!!!   SECOND -- The obstacles are for the dogs!!!   Unless you are actually trying to work with your dog to help them learn how to negotiate them stay off them... Let the dogs play..   Don't stand in the way on the jumping ramp into the lake. When your big butt stands there, others can't throw things for their dog to jump off it... Get out of the way!!!!   THIRD --If you have to carry your dog to the end of the ramp and throw it in the lake to make it go in the water, maybe your dog is not ready for this park or the water.   I know you may think it is fun, but it really ruins the experience for your dog. Maybe you think this gets your dog used to it, but from a training stand point, if it makes your dog scared and it is less likely to want to do it again. Start from the edge, your dog might learn to enjoy it..   FOURTH --Dog fights will happen in an environment like this..   When it does, try taking control of your own dog rather than rubber necking to look at the dog fight. Ever notice that a small fight can turn into a large one as the other dogs join in. Take control of your own dog and let the owners of the fighting dogs take care of their dogs.   FIFTH --If you know your dog is aggressive before you enter the park, DON'T BRING YOUR DOG IN IDIOT.   I can't tell you how many owners I have watched who have a problem with their dog just getting from the parking lot to the dog run area. Maybe this is not the place for you..   FINALLY --Ever noticed how a pet will assume the personality of their owner.   If the dog is a nut case, there is a good chance the human holding the leash is too. If the dog is rude, bullish, or just all around a disturbance, chances are the one holding the leash has problems too..   We usually have to have a license for dogs. Maybe a dog owner should have to get a license first. Let's limit the idiot dog owners of the world!!! Probably can say the same for these same bad pet owners that have kids too though!!!!   THIS IS A 5 STAR PLACE. I TAKE MY DOG THERE. SHE HAS FUN. NOT TOO MANY PLACES I CAN TAKE HER WHERE SHE CAN PLAY IN THE WATER AND INTERACT WITH OTHER DOGS. DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH FOR YOUR COMFORT. AFTER ALL, IT WAS NOT BUILT FOR YOU AS THE HUMAN... SO YOU MAY HAVE TO SUFFER THE HEAT, SMELL AND DIRT FOR AN HOUR OR SO... BUT IT IS WELL WORTH IT!!!!!

I regularly go to this place for lunch with a group of co-workers. We usually get there around 11:30 a.m.  I am always amazed that this location is never busy.   This is one of my favorite locations in town. I can't say that I have ever had bad food during my visits.   Again, today, 5 of the guys went in for lunch. Ordered seveal orders of sashimi, nigiri, and about 6 rolls.  All tasted very good.  We were also served two complimentary orders of pot stickers.  I pretty sure because of the slow service.   My favorite is the Hawaian Role and Samurai Roll.  The Jalapeno Role is also good.   My only complaint was that the food prep was a little slow. There was only one sushi chef and she clearly had a hard time keeping up with order. Now, I can understand if the place was packed, but when you are the only group in the restaurant, I would think the roles would come flying out!!!  Getting there at 11:00 a.m. we did not get out until almost 12:30 p.m.  A little too long for the only group in the place.   Reading prior reviews, I learned that the place is under new management.  And it was a different chef behind the bar than the person from previous visit.  So maybe we are still developing skills.   Will continue to visit. Food has always been good regardless owner.  Don't always want to spend 1 1/2 hour for lunch.  Would be 5 Stars.  But due to slower service today, taking away one star...

Visited 5/27/13  I have been to this place prior, but it was long before I was a member on Yelp.   This review is done in conjunction with another review for Vino 100 which is in the same center.  Attending a music event at Vino 100, which has a limited food menu.  But they allow you to bring food in.    Brought in a large pizza. Had the usual toppings.  Pizza is one of the better NY style pizza in town. It is too bad it is so far from my usual hang outs.   Cave Creek is lucky to have this place as there are so few options available in this area. If you are traveling, stop by and try a pizza.

It has only been recently that I have started reviewing other places beside restaurants.   I was very surprised to see only two reviews, neither good. I have been taking pets here for several years. And always had great service. Dr. Stitzer was our first vet. He went through some tough times with older pets. But was good about not trying to force unnecessary tests.   Although Dr. Stitzer is not available most times, Dr. Waldo has been my regular for my young lab. Again, I am happy with service.   I don't board my pets so I can't comment about those services. But for pet care, I have always been happy.   My one complaint, like most Dr's, it seems like I am always waiting for my appointment. I understand that things happen, but if I am on time, they should be too. Maybe schedule appointments further apart?

Any time I get the hankering for wings, this is my go to place.  Honey Hot, Asagio Parmesan, and Hot.   There are several places on my way home to stop at.  I have telephone numbers for all the locations in my phone.  I can order about 15 minutes ahead of time and it is ready at take out window when I get there.   They have nice bars. Good selections of beers.  And the one on Signal Butte particularly has nice bar for watching games.

Visted 1/26/13.   I was very pleased with this location.  I don't get involved in the arguements about which location is the best for Cheese Steak in Philly.  I just know if it taste good, I am happy.   I had the Mushroom/Onion.  I would have liked a litle more cheese.  And I learned after the fact that I think I could have requested Cheese Wiz.   Bread was good.  Filled with meat.  And I was very satisfied when I was done.   I am adding this location to my list for a quick, GOOD, Cheese Steak.

Visited 11/23/12...  This is always a great place for a hamburger.  Endless steak fries.  And great shakes.    I have always had a good burger. Better than fast food with bar and ability to have a beer or other beverage if you desier.   Good service.  Quick food.   Always a reliable choice for a quick burger.

I love this place!!!  I am a huge fan of Take-n-Bake pizza. There is nothing better than pulling a piping hot pizza out of your own oven and having fresher than any other way other than sitting at the pizza parlor.   We are a big fan of the Chicken Garlic.  I also love the stuffed meat pizza.  They also have bread sticks that you cook at home. Pre-made salads and cooking dough ready.   They key to success for Take-N-Bake, save the number in your phone. Call ahead and place your order. That way it is ready when you show up. In and out the door in 5 minutes.   There is another similar take-n-bake around my home, but the value of this place makes it well worth the 5 miles out of the way into AJ worth it..  Find a place near your home and give it a try.  You will love it..

Visited 5/28/12...  This was a whim on Memorial Day Weekend. It was very quiet.  Which means quick service for us.  Had the Gyro Platter.  As appetizer I recommend the Greek Fries.  Also the Flamming Feta.  I did have a side salad.  Disappointed that it lacked the olives that would make this better.  Dessert, we had Flamming Baklava.  Yep, that did it..  I have been to this chain several times.  Never had a bad meal.  Great for lunch too.  Sill the best Gyro I can find around.

I love this place. I have been to 5 or 6 all across the valley and have never been disappointed. Some of the best New York style pizza in town.   Lunches are very reasonable. Can get pizza by the slice or order a whole pizza also. Also some good salads... I like the Greek with balsamic vinegar..   Lunch prices are great. Pizza and Salad for $6.00 plus cost of a drink. Better than any fast food. Can take out or eat in...   Want a dessert, try the cooking and ice cream options. If you have room after your pizza.   Would make this my regular pizza place if I had one closer to house..   Need a lunch place. Want a slice and drink.. Give it a try. Don't think they will disappointed.

A great People Experience place.   Free enterainment watching the drunks.  Light show acros the covered three block area.   If you are out of money and need something free to do or just need break from casino, take a couple of hours.  Best not when it is 100 degrees out though!!

This course remains one of the old courses of Phoenix. Still maintained by the City of Phoenix, this course offers every level of golfer some challenges and enjoyments.   Not the longest course  you will find, it offeres other challenges in the way the course weaves through the Cave Creek Wash.  Tee boxes that require drives over the wash. Approaches that are some times blind and many times from unlevel lies.  And some challenging greens.  You won't be disappointed.   My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars... Phoenix has adopted a more difficult tee time reservation system.  Having to call into a central number or reserve through the internet, the City has made it more difficult.   But take a minute to get a tee time, you will love the challenge..

It has been a close to a year since I have been to The Olive Mill.  I believe I have written a review under The Olive Mill itself, but not for this location which is the restaurant site.  They have made significant improvements and expansions since my last visit.  The changes have opened up the floor and made it much easier to move around in the crowds.    The restaurant is a walk up and order type of place.  They do offer beer, wines, champagne.  Very nice little location for breakfast and lunches.  They also offering pizza nights, live music in evenings.  Nice choices of sandwiches along with some side dishes.  I have not had a bad meal yet.   I am disappointed that you have to go to the coffee shop to get your cup of coffee.  (See below.)  Also offer some very good gelato.  My favorite the Blood Orange.   There is also a coffee shop in this location.  They offer expanded coffee drinks.  But it is disappointing that you have to stand in this line to get your coffee that you ordered from the other line when you ordered your meal.  They also do not have free refills?? Although a .50 charge for a refill is not bad, the fact that you do not have unlimited coffee when you go for breakfast is unfortunate.  They give you the ability to buy fresh roasted whole bean coffee.  But at the $12.00 per 12 oz bag, that is a little pricey for me!!  Here with family today to visit.  We went for a late breakfast. We all had or shared a portion of the waffle.  Very good.  One had it with bananas, pistachio nuts and whip cream.  Two other classic.  The fresh maple syrup topped it off for me.  I also had the Sicilian Breakfast Sandwich.  It was good, but a little cold.  Overall, this was a very nice breakfast and worth the little higher price that you might have to pay.   I am a little disappointed in The Olive Mill in general.  They offer a very nice selection of fresh, local made olive oils.  Different flavors along with balsamic. Their pricing seems to have increased. I really have to weigh whether the price tag on many of the "special blend" oils are worth it.  I have always like that they offer wines from small vineyards.  And they do have nice prices for some of the bottles.  But I am disappointed that they do not offer the free wine tastings, as it was now $10.00 (but they did have an expanded offerings of wines to taste.)  This is worth the time and visit. Especially for someone out of town that has not been here.  **** Just an update, I received feedback from The Olive Mill management. I learned that the wine tasting event that they held the weekend I visisted, which there was a charge for, was a special event. I was informed that on other regular weekends, the wine tasting is still free.  And it is these tastings I have experienced some nice, well priced small vineyard wines.

It is too bad that this location is so far way from home. I have been to several King's Fish House both in AZ and in CA. And have always been very happy.   I am not a fan of the Tempe Market Place area. It is a little difficult to get in and out of.  But I do like the setting.  We were able to sit outdoors and watch people go by which was enjoyable.   We had Salmon for both orders. Very well prepared. Just a nice piece of fish well cooked.   Service was very good.  This is always a go to if we are in the area for a nice piece of fish.

Last visited 4/27/12...  I have been here several times so I am surprised that I have not written a review yet.  Each time I have been here, the food has been very good.  I have tried a range of BBQ dishes including the Baby Backs, Tri-Tip, Brisket and Pulled Pork.  Each meat has been great.  Many sides to choose from.  Baked Beans, sweat potato mashed, regular and garlic mashed, etc.  The Mac and Cheese is probably not their best dish.  Biscuits are good as is the corn bread.  I also enjoy the Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer.   Service is usually very good and attentive.  This last visit, I was a little disappointed about the ability to keep drinks full. It seems anywhere I have been going lately wait staff has a very hard time paying attention to drinks.  This to me is a huge service error and likely to always cost a restaurant an extra star.   I have also had desserts there although not this last time, Too Full!!    It is a great location.  Parking is always available although on weekends you may have to walk from back lot a little as this location shares with Dave and Busters and Cadillac Ranch.  Overall, a very good dinner on Friday night!!

I have not been to a bad location yet! The food was good and service met the mark.   I do have one small complaint on this trip.  Ordered the Rib/Rib combo.  The Baby Back portion was over cooked.  The ribs were crispy and charred.  But the St. Louis ribs met the mark.   Also had the mac and cheese.  Nice touch with corn and jalapeno.   Famous Daves remains a nice fall back when needing the quick fix for BBQ.

Visited 12/15/13.  Still very much a fan. I always seem to get a good meal when I need a fix for BBQ.   One thing I did not on last meal... Ordered Burnt Ends and Rib combo.  Unfortunately, these were not Burnt Ends. Too soft and a little fatty. It was still good, but not what I was expecting.  Really wanted that "burnt" end taste.  Otherwise, will continue to come back when in the area.

Long before I was YELPING (is that really a verb?) I went to this establishment. I must confess that I really did not remember the experience.   So with family in town, we decided to try it again. Before going, I read the reviews, I found myself confused with the mixed reviews. But after our experience, I now understand.   This restaurant is for Atmosphere only!!! If you want a good dinner or good steak, go somewhere else.   Now there are two ways to eat at this establishment:   First---  Go to the sit down restaurant portion. Order from menu. Have food delivered like normal.   Second--  Sit out at patio yard in back. To get food, you must go to walk up window, order and have food brought out. I am not sure if menu for this is the same for restaurant or not??   Now tonight, the Saturday before Easter we went to dinner. Figuring that it would be busy, we tried to go early, 5:00. But getting there about 30 minutes late, found that the parking lot was already very full and patio area was packed.   Still having some lucky family genes, we found a parking spot right in front and were able to get seated at table in restaurant side immediately. 5 minutes later, I don't think we would have been that lucky...   So when you see the reviews about parking and long waits, I understand their frustrations.   Three of the four ordered Rib Eye steaks. The fourth a Jack Daniels Chicken. It is pretty tough to screw up a chicken breast so can't comment on that. However, the Rib Eye... Not worth the $18 price tag. Very POOR piece of meat and not cooked very well. I was up sold on the mushrooms, which were served on top. This did nothing to cover the poor quality of meat and poor cooking.   Now I fancy myself a pretty good cook. I make a mean breakfast, do well on dinners, and do very well on the grill. So anytime I find myself thinking that I can do better at home, I know the food is not very good....   Service was average. Not sure the waitress even gave us her name. And was clearly too busy, with too many tables to provide quality attention.   Maybe on a different night when things are not as busy, it might be better. But if the cut of meat is the same quality, I don't care what you do to it, how good your service person is, or how many mushrooms you put on top, it will still taste bad.  It will never be worth the $18 price.   Three steak dinners, one chicken dinner one alcoholic drink for each, no dessert... Total bill $118.00 including tip... NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am sure the patio atmosphere would be very fun! Fires in pits, roasted marshmallows, and often times live music. So if you are looking for fun place to go with friends to enjoy an evening under stars, this might be the place.   Want a good steak or other type meal... Go somewhere else...

I have always wanted to try this location while at Bass Pro.  It is a nice little restaurant. Was almost empty when we were there.   I ordered a Talapia (sp?) sandwich. It was filling and enjoyable.  But not great.   Because we were there at "lunch time" we did not really look at the dinner menu or the full meal opportunities.   The setting is a nice place. Clean. Nicely decorated.   Not a place I would go to just for the food. But a place I would consider if at Bass Pro again and hungry.

Visited 5/8/12...   What can I say, its Cracker Barrel.  Have been there many times.  Never reviewed before now.  Don't know why.   Southern food.  Had country fried steak, mashed potatoes, fried oakra.  It all tasted very good.    Went in for dinner.  But found myself very tempted when I was given a Breakfast Anytime menu.  Not too many places that I would try the breakfast menu in the evening, but this might be a place I will have to remember for breakfast in the evening fix.

I have been here on several occasions now.   I always end up ordering steak and always end up regretting it.  Rib Eye was very thin cut.  Over cooked. And just not a good piece of meat.   I also had side of Mac & Cheese. I sent it back.  I was not any better than Kraft.  Dinner salad small.   The waitress was attentive and at least managed to keep the drinks full.   I think this is a good place for a happy hour, beer and appetizer.  But I won't be going back for dinner again.  Especially steak!!

Visited 10/28/113.  I have been several times in the past. I have not had a bad meal or service at any time.   Shared a dinner salad which was huge. One was enough for the two of us. I ordered the Baseball Sirloin which was cooked just perfect.  I also had the Clam Chowder.  I am not really a fan of corn in my Chowder, but this still was very good.   Service was great.  We were able to sit outside as it was just cool enough.   The price may be just slightly more than you might get at the next steakhouse that is a step down.  But lately, we have not been getting good steaks at the lower priced competitors.  For the money and quality, this a great place for a good steak.

If you have ever lived in or traveled through a rural area, the number one rule for finding a good restaurant is to look for the parking lot that is full. Look for the parking lot that has the farmers trucks, the police cars or the fire trucks. When you find this place, you have found the best place in town.   Don't worry when you drive by this place that it looks like a little SHACK!!  Because that is just what it is. A place so small and off to the side of the road that if you aren't looking for it, you would miss it. A place so small that if you do see it, you would never think to stop.   But if you do venture to try this small shack of a restaurant, you are in for a treat.   Jim's Burros offers a small menu of more typical burritos and tacos. They offer a limited breakfast menu, but offer it all day long. And have a daily .99 cent menu item. My favorite... Taco Tuesday... Ground beef tacos on hard shells. Six usually does the trick for me. But that still gets me out the door for less than $7.00.   Jim's Burros provides a great food, at an exceptional prices. Most items run less than $6.00.   Take Out takes less than 10 minutes. Call ahead and your food is usually ready by the time you get there... I live 5 minutes away and my order is always ready by the time I arrive. If you do Take Out, spend the extra couple of bucks and get a large side of salsa also. It saves well and is better than anything you will ever find in the store.   Want a change, try the Chili Reno. A large green chili wrapped in egg and smothered in green chili sauce. This is not an appetizer, this baby is huge.   Want a traditional breakfast? Pancakes are so huge that three are two large to for me to finish. Omelette's that are filling. And breakfast burritos that are huge. Again, all for less than about $5.00.   Eat In, you get chips and salsa at the table while you wait. Just a perfect taste waiting for the meal.   My only complaint.... They are not open on Sunday. This would be perfect for breakfast burrito take out on Sunday morning for Sunday football.   If you make it to Queen Creek area, look for the small shack on the side of the road. They have added signs and store decorations to make it more visible. So don't be afraid. It might be a hole in the wall place, but you won't regret it...  Remember, if you live in the community, always support your local places. Good restaurants that are just around the corner are few and far between.  So forget the chain places like Filberto's that seem to have popped up everywhere, support the local businesses!!!

Visited 8/5/12.. This is worth it.   Have been here twice.  Each time breakfast was great.   Worth the price.   Have had omelets, and pancakes, both times good.   They also have a chicken enchilada skillet for a special which was great.  Going to try the chicken enchilada omelet next time.

A QC / San Tan Valley secret.   Located at corner of Hunt Highway and Belle Vista.  Northwest corner.   Great for Gyros.  Have also had the Greek Fries.  They were very good.  But Gyro is worth it.   Great stop for lunch!!

How can you go wrong..  Fresh choices of frozen meats including pork, chicken (white and dark,) beef, and sometimes fish depending on what time you go.  Pile on that huge choices of fresh vegetables.  Add to that the many choices of dry spices and sauces.  Give your dish to cook and he grills it over a big grill.  You control the portion. You control the ingriedients. You control the flavor.   $10.75 which includes drink.  If you want unlimited, its $12.75.    Its clean, fresh and tasty.   Yes, everything gets mixed together.  So if you are a person that needs your meal separated into sections, this is not the place for you.   Want a nice change and fresh hot bowl, stop by.  This is a gem that I had forgotten about until I was reminded recently by a friend.  And now it will soon become my regular.

Have been here three times now since they move the to their new location. When they first moved to the new location, I thought this would be a mistake for them. A very out of the way location just West of Ellsworth on Germann.. Boy was I wrong!!!   Third time through last night. Went with visiting family. We were late getting out the door for dinner so did not get there until almost 7:30 p.m. The parking lot was packed as was the restaurant.   Now, I have to say one thing before I move on... It is one thing to go out to dinner with family/friends to enjoy an evening out. I am all about sitting around the table for a nice conversation and laughs... But if you have finished your meal and find that  you are sitting around all the while the restaurant is packed with people waiting for a table, then maybe it is time to pack up and leave. It is the respectful thing to do. It is one thing to sit around a table when the restaurant is not very busy.. But when it is packed and there is a line out the door, taking up space to sit around and talk for hours is not only rude to the waiting people, but the staff that have to service your table. The server makes money based on tips and therefore is dependent on the number of people that they can get through their tables. Not too mention the restaurant itself that is dependent on the number of customers it can service to make money.  When you sit around, you are hurting their ability to make money. Move to the bar or simply get out. But don't take up a table for hours after you have finished your meal when there are people waiting.   With that said, we arrived to a packed restaurant. We were told that it would be about 35 minutes, but with the VERY RUDE couple of tables that wanted to sit around and talk, it ended up being an hour...   They do take reservations. And I would recommend them or getting there early, before 5:30 if you don't want to wait. At least on a Friday or Saturday night..   Table ordered:  Pepperoni Pizza, Baked Stuffed Shells with Meat Sauce, Shrimp & Asparagus in Vodka Sauce on Angel Hair - Special of Night, and Chicken and Shrimp Capricioso with Angel Hair.   All food was very good. Very traditional Italian.   No appetizers for table last night, but have had the Bruschetta in past and it has been very good.   Table is also supplied with unlimited fresh baked bread which is outstanding.   In the past have had several different pasta dishes. And also the Chicken Parmigiana. All have been very good.   Service is very slow, which is why I don't provide the 5th Star. And has been each time we have been there. Staff just does not seem to be in any hurry.   I also happened to watch while the owner appeared to be training a new waitress at front of house. Was close enough that I could over hear him giving lectures and teaching. Then watched as he went over different wines on menu. Now, as slow as the service is, I would think that you would find a better time to train instead of Friday night at the busiest time...   But give it a try. You won't be disappointed. But plan ahead. You cannot be in a hurry when you go...

Visited too many times to count.  How is it that I have never written a review???  I love this place.  Sushi in Queen Creek!!!  I have not had a bad experience of bad taste yet.  I always try to go during Happy Hour times only because they have some nice priced menu options.  Recently though, they changed their menu and removed probably their best item, Jalapeno Tempura.  Spicy Tuna in a halved jalapeno and tempura fried.  I still order it even if it is at full price.   Good drink offers.  Close to home and fresh taste.   It ranks up their with many of the Sushi places I have been too!!!  And I have been to many!!

Recent visit on Sunday 8/12/12. It is Happy Hour all day on Sunday.  So this is a great option.  Discounted nigiri tuna and some limited rolls.   But this weekend, have a small complaint....  When we arrived a little before Noon there were three tables.  During our time, it was up to 7 tables.  Food came out very slow.  The waitress was clearly overwhelmed and I had to waive her down several times for things, including to order a second beer.  Now, above all else, do you not always make sure the alcohol orders are taken care of??  One sushi chef.   Friend ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish.  Chicken was cold by the time it arrived so it is clear that it sat for a while before making its way to the table.   Now, this is the first time I have made it to Sunday Happy Hour.  Usually, I am there Friday nights.  It is packed. Lots of wait staff and chefs.  Food comes out quick. Alcohol quicker.  Hopefully this is just a fluke day.   I love this place. Close to home. Good sushi...  Owner, if you read these reviews, please take note!!!

One of the few places you can access on a Friday/Saturday night in Queen Creek without a wait.    Uncle Bears continues to be a fall back place when other options don't work.  Always good hamburgers, salads, wings.  And good selection of beers.    Plus it is a great place to catch a came as they have TV's around the entire place.   Nice outdoor seating with fire place if you are lucky enough to get that seat at night. Not that you will need it come July!!  Can't find anything else or not sure where to go, add Uncle Bears to your list of favorites.  Good comfort food and great prices.

7/22/12 I always have to try little hole in the wall places. Most times it works out. Not this time!!!  Very unappealing. Bacon was cheap and very small portion. Eggs over medium average. And biscuits and gravy poor. They did not have any flavor and gravy was watered down.  Pricey for the poor quality.   They also did not offer Egg Beaters which is what my companion was looking for.  So she had to settle for a burger that was average at best.   Oh well, off to the next hole in the wall.

A little behind on my reviews....   Went here for lunch on 5/5/10. This was a lunch with family/friends.   We were there at about 11:30. Only a few other tables were occupied. We were seated pretty quickly. Then had to wait about 5-10 minutes before waitress showed up. Another 5 minutes to return with simple soda and lemonade orders.   Lunch orders included two salads, chicken tenders and fries, chicken sandwich and fries, angel hair pasta dish, and personal deep dish pizza.   Salads are a Little hard to screw up. Pizza was only warm. Some bites tasted like not yet cooked yet. Both orders with fries, the fries were cold as well as the pasta dish.   Of course, waitress never came back to check on our orders after a few minutes. So probably 10-15 minutes went by before she came visible to waiver her over. When we told her food was cold, she was clearly confused and unsure what to do. She said she would be back in a minute.   Manager too sounded confused and surprised... "Don't know why food would be cold?" He offered to bring out new order of fries, which he did fairly quickly.. No offer to discount meal ticket, no offer of free dessert, just apology and fresh basket of fries...   Would love to go back to this place to try the beer and maybe appetizers. Being a huge beer drinker, would love to try the different brews. The appetizer menu looked pretty good too.   I realize that any place can have a bad day. But first impressions are critical. Especially for food and restaurants. This will not be a place I would consider again unless the timing for Happy Hour presents itself...

There is really not much to say about Chinese Food.  My experience is they are all about the same.   I  usually look toward my regular wherever I go.  Some type of Orange Chicken and a Combo Fried Rice. I also added Hot and Sour Soup.  The meal was only slightly satisfying. It was lacking flavor.  The soup had very little except broth.  The Chicken was just average.  And the Fried Rice was lacking flavor as well.   There are other locations closer to my house in this area I would drift to.   Not a place that I would tend to want to go back to.

Second time through yesterday...  Down grading my review.  There is nothing that stands out to make this place better than just another burger.    I ordered with different toppings. Stayed simple with Bacon, mushrooms, and of course jalapenos.. Order fries and a drink.  $12.00..    It was just a burger.  It was o.k. but not worth the $12.00 price. Honestly, Wendy's goes down better for me. Fries are just not doing it for me. I ordered regular. Added lot's of salt and ketchup and that helped.  It must be a taste thing, I just like my fries crispy.  I would still go back if in the area and wanting a burger.  But will also favor the In & Out or other places if I am going that direction instead.

Visited 5/25/12...  I really do like this place for a chain pizza restaurant!!  We were in late night on a pizza and wing craving.Given that we were in 30 minutes before closing, I was really expecting the cooks heart would not be in our order!!  I was wrong!!  Their baked wings were very good. Cooked right and smoothered in Honey Hot.  Pizza was their special with all the toppings.  Fresh and good.   Wait staff was great. They did not make us feel rushed even whle we sat there 15 minutes after the doors closed.   5 Stars for this night simply for job well done 30 minutes before closing!!!

I have been to this location many times in the recent months.    Each time we have ordered whole pizza. And also had the special which includes wings.   I have been very happy with this style of pizza. And wings have been very good also.  Wings are meaty and have nice cover of sauce without being over powered.  I will say that this style of pizza (in my opinion) is better with only a few toppings.  Once you add too many toppings, it seams to come out a little heavy.  Will stick to the traditional one or two toppings and keep it more of the NY style.   I have only been there in the evening and ordered whole pizza. So I cannot comment on whether it is a good place for one or two slices.  I will say that the pizza that was under the lights at counter did not look very appealing or fresh when we came in in the evening.  I would probably avoid the one/two slice order based on appearance.   But want a good whole pizza, this is my place!!!

O.k. Once again, I have to say "Support your local business."  For the most part, Chinese food is about the same.  Not too much difference. The names on the menu may be different, but you can usually find what you like under some other name.   So I am not going to tell you that Moon China is any different..  I get what I expect. A good meal, for a fairly good price.   But this place has chosen to open a business in the "no where land" of Queen Creek/San Tan Valley. The NE corner of Ironwood and Ocotillo.  Not much else is around there.   They have a very good menu, good prices and their food is good.  Take out is quick. I live 5 minutes away.  By the time I place my order, put on my shoes, and drive around the corner, the food is ready.    Tonight, same thing...  Order, put on shoes, drive around corner and pick up.  Food ready.   They are always very nice. Have offered me complimentary drink while waiting if food was not ready.    My favorite--- Honey Crispy Chicken... Good flavor, nice little tang/spice.    Let's not overlook the fact that they are open on Sunday.  That is huge for this area.  Most places are closed...  So it a bonus when you look up and find it is 6 p.m. and have not figured anything for dinner.  This place is always a good fall back!!!  We have so few options.  Support your local business.

8/4/12  I still love this place!!  I have not had a bad experience.  Had St. Louis ribs, potato salad and green beans. Appetizer of Corn Fritters, great and large portion. Ribs were just a little tough, but edible. Love the sauce choices. One of the better chain BBQ places.  It is a great fall back.

We stopped in just to check things out.   Huge selection of candies.  Many things brought back memories of the younger days.  If your looking for the unusual or looking for bulk, definitely worth the visit.   Would watch the prices on some of the normal candy bars. I am not sure that the bulk pricing on these items are worth it. Wal-Mart, Sam's Club offer much better.    But if you want the unusual or the candy you remember as a kid, stop in.

Visited 8/2/13.  It has been a while since I have been to Chompie's.  Long before I was involved in Yelp.   This was a pleasant change. I had order of sliders which were excellent.  I could never finish the challenge!!  Also had Clam Chowder which was very good. Ordered a "cup" expecting a small cup and got what I would call a "bowl."  Looking forward to my return for the Monte Cristo.   Great comfort Deli type food.

Visited 5/5/12...  In my opinion, this restaurant truly fits the phrase "it is all about the experience."  The food dishes we had were outstanding!! I very much enjoyed the food selections including Sugar Snap Peas, Shasito Peppers, Kimchi, Scallops with Strawberry, Seared Tuna,  and Pork Belly.  The last being a must.. Our friends also ordered Sea Bass and clams.   My compliments to the chef as each dish had a nice unique taste that is not typical at other places.   The setting is very intimate being set in an very old historic home in downtown.   The portions are very small!!  And for me, this is disappointing.  Especially when you compare the price to the portion.  Now before anyone wants to respond, I acknowledge that this is about the experience.  And the food was excellent!!   But in these trying times, when I drop almost $100.00 for two for dinner, I at least want to walk out without feeling like I need to hit the closest fast food place.   I would go back.  This would be a great place for a quick appetizer type of start.  Go in, experience a couple of dishes that offer a nice fresh change in taste.  Then head out for dinner.    But not a regular type of place for me.  Go here for the atmosphere and experience.  Enjoy some different dishes that taste great.   But find a regular somewhere else.   P.S.  Located right next to Rose and Crown.  A nice tavern in a similar style house in the Heritage area.  Great locations for ballparks and convention center.

This location has become our go to location for Mexican Food.   They menu selection is not a typical selection. So if you are look for a combo plate with burrito, taco, etc. you may not quite find the menu you are looking for.  We have been three times, I have tried three different selections and been very happy with the food.   My only complaint is that there salsa with the chips is less than what I prefer in flavor and spice.  Will return when we are in mood for Mexican Food.

We stopped her for a change. I don't want to get into the Pat's vs. Geno's from Philly.  I was just excited at the possibility of a good cheesesteak sandwich.  I ordered the Geno's Special?  Cheesesteak with Cheese Wiz.  It was very disappointing.  $8.99.  Sandwich only.  No chips, no drink.  Fries are another $3.00.   The sandwich was small.  Not filled very much with meat. I ended up with an inch of bun (at least) without any meat. The buns are soft and do not hold up very well to the juice and mess. Not that there was much in filling to really make much of a difference.   The only positive was that it did taste good!  But I will not go back.  $13.00 for a sandwich and drink is not worth it.  I would pay this if it were a good sandwich. I would probably pay more..    Also, my friend had Cheesesteak with Provolone.  Very much the same.

Visited 6/15/13  A little hole in the wall that I wish were closer to home!!    The menu offers a nice selection of what I would consider more authentic food. Not what I would consider the typical "Americanized" dishes.   Ordered the Green Onion Pancakes and Steamed Pork Dumplings.  Both were very good. We found the pancakes to be a little light in flavor. But when I ate them with my main dish, it made a nice balance.   I had the Cumin Lamb.  Very tasty with a nice spice.  Was very rich in flavor which filled me very quickly.  Again, the pancakes when nicely with this dish.    Girlfriend had the Stir-Fry Pork Neck Bones.  A large plate of falling off the bone pork bones.  This dish really needed some vegetables to balance the heavy flavor and fill of the pork bones.  You do have to work to get the meat off the bone a little. Small bones with small meat, but it was worth the taste.   I was most impressed with the Handmade Appetizer menu.  There were many things that I want to try from this list. I could probably make a meal just from this part of the menu.  I would also like to try the different soups.   Overall, this is a very good Chinese restaurant. Although they do offer the more typical selections, try something a little different!!

Visited 5/11/13.  Tilted Kilt is a typical bar type restaurant.  They have a nice selection of draft beers.  And typical bar food.  In fact, on this visit, my food was less than quality. I had the open meat loaf sandwich. It was not very filling and I was not impressed with the meat loaf.   It is in a nice location next to both US Airways Arena and Chase Ball Park. Nice location to meet for a quick burger and beer before a game.   My main reason for this review is to compliment the service, or management during this specific day.  And the reason for the fourth star....  With a group of guys for a day at the ball game.  On first round of drinks, waitress spilled beer down my back while serving. She was carrying too much to handle and trying to reach across and set glass down. Lost control of her tray and the result was a beer bath.  Of course I was in my game jersey...  The waitress response was less than quality. After cleaning up the spill and delivering a new beer, her only response was to ask if there was "anything else I needed."  At that point, it was time to talk with the manager...  I wish I could remember the manager name... He told me, but I forgot...  But his response and service was exceptional.  Comp'd my meal and offered to give me a t-shirt from their store. But when he did not have my size, gave me money to by a new t-shirt at the ball park.  Only because of the manager response would I return. If it was left up to the waitress and her response, probably would not be back..

Yep!!  Another great frozen dessert place that I can go to on my travels.   This was excellent.  Very rich flavor so a smaller amount was sufficient.  Be prepared to stand in line for a period of time.  They allow sampling so everyone has to try samples which takes more time.  Well worth the wait.  Pricing very comparable to frozen yogurt places.

Visited 8/3/13 We were hesitant after reviewing several of the review. Quite frankly, the last time we thought about going we changed our minds after we read the reviews.   But in a search for chicken wings, we thought we would risk it.  We were pleasantly surprise!!  The winds came out hot and fresh. They were large and meaty, not fatty.  We had three different orders, Parmesan Garlic, Honey Hot, and straight Medium.  We also ordered house salads which was a nice change with candied walnuts and apples.  I would change to the Balsamic dressing next time.  It does seem to be a trend that places are charging more for Ranch Dressing?  Small little container and only two came out with a order of three sets of wings.  Does Ranch Dressing really cost that much that a chicken wing place cannot supply a nice portion with the wings???  Overall, I we were pleased.  Will likely return and hope to get the same fresh order of wings next time.

8/5/12  Checked in at door. Packed. Told 10 minutes???  Waited 20.  Left when it became apparent it would be longer. The poor reviews I was reading on Yelp at time didn't help.  Tip to hostess, be honest about wait time.

I was very excited to see that this place had opened.  What a great location. Next to movie theaters and bowling center.    This will be a regular for me.  First time last night. I tried combo of Pistachio Peanut Butter, and Vanilla Bean.  All were very good.  Pistachio is on the top of my list now.  But Peanut Butter is close.   I thought price was very good also.  Seemed a little lower in price than some other similar yogurt places I have gone.   For those that don't know, it is self serve.  Fill a cup from about 15 or so choices of different soft frozen yogurt.   Try it.  Its better than your ice cream places.

I love these stores.  I have been to many.  GREAT options for pizza.  Take it home, bake it yourself.  Hot and fresh out of the oven.   This was a newer location.  Much easier than my other location in Apache Junction.   And they have some new menu options.   Try it.  You won't order delivery again.

Visited 5/27/12...  So was craving BBQ.  What would be better than that on Memorial Day Weekend.   Went with two other friends.  Had heard this place had recently opened and my friend had heard by rumor mill it was good.   First, I don't give much stake to reviews.  I am the type of person that has to try it myself to believe it.  However, in this case the reviews that reflect the 2 Star rating are extremely accurate.   They had half priced appetizers.  We had an order of the Red Neck Tacos.  Pulled Pork with Jalapeno slaw over corn cakes.  These were probably the best thing we ordered.  Although the Pulled Pork was much like my main order, see below..  Had 3 Meat meal with Pulled Pork, Brisket and Baby Backs. Baby Backs are a 1/4 slab.  It came with 4.  So I had to research to learn that a Full Slab is considered about 16 Ribs.  However, these were very small, for whatever that is worth.  Another friend had 3 Meat with Chicken.  In all cases, the four available meat choices were dry and over cooked. Baby Backs, the meat was falling off the bone - over cooked. The rub was extremely salty and overpowered any meat taste, smoke taste and BBQ Sauce.  Brisket, dry.  Chicken, dry, Pulled Pork was probably the best of the 4 meats - dry.  The BBQ sauces are lacking.  One that I still don't know what it was supposed to be, another a little spicier and there regular.   A third friend stuck with his own order of Red Neck Tacos and then a side of Mac & Cheese.  This side was really pretty good.  Maybe the second best thing we had.   I was extremely disappointed.  It is not open for lunch, which is maybe the only other time I might try to return for a sandwich.  Otherwise, there are way too many other locations that serve better BBQ than this.   If you are thinking about it, don't do what I do... Trust some of the reviews and maybe move on.

A gem in old town!!!  This was a roll of the dice tonight. We wanted a burger and we were around Scottsdale. It came up on Yelp with great reviews.  My only complaint is that there is not one closer to my home in QC.    The food was great!! Burger cooked perfect.  Had an appetizer of the Pig Wings.  A must!! They would be a great Happy Hour order.   In the mood or a burger and don't want the standard fast food, don't let the Old Town Scottsdale scare you away from trying this place!!  BTW... The owners are the same owners as Oregano's Pizza...

This place ranks better than most sub places.  It has great flavors. Hot, toasted sub's.  And good prices.   Just wish they would add another soda fountain machine.  Have to stand in line to access the only one, usually behind children that cannot make up their mind and want to play with it.!!

Visited 1/3/14  This is the worst car wash around!!  I have been several times. Each time I go I swear I won't go back. And then several months later convince myself to give it another chance.   On this last visit, I tried again. Convinced myself that it would be better.   After I drove away and got into the sun where I could see the interior, it was obvious they have not improved. Dash as smeared with treatment. Windows were horrible, almost like they used the same cloth as they used on the interior.  I spent an hour cleaning windows and re-doing areas after I got home.   I have also had similar experiences of pushy glass repair people as indicated in other reviews.   Unfortunately, there are very few options.  But my suggestion is to either do it yourself or drive the extra time to a better location.

Great way to spend a Saturday. Pricing is not bad. Great selection of different vendors. And a I enjoyed the Tequilla tasting tent.   The heat made it less enjoyable.  Would have been nice to have more shaded seating.  But who would figure that it would be 100 degrees on October 15th.   This is a nice location.  Great arrangement and easy access.   I got there earlier in the morning, so parking was a little easier to find.  Come later in the day and parking as well as lines to get through entrance may be little longer.   The $10 entry fee may have been a little high considering that you really got nothing for that fee.  As you have to pay for food and drinks via purchasing tickets.  But reading about the event, I believe there was a charity involved too, so that may be where the fees go.   Be prepared for heat, dust and dirt.   Remember, this is ony the second year.  I am sure they are already planing on how to make it better.    I can't wait of 2012.

Our first visit on 2/1/13. This place has been open for about a month. We were very excited to try. Several good reviews from fellow Yelpers  This a small business tuck in a back corner. Limited seating. It has more of a take out feel.   Food is comfort Southern. They basically offer three choices, Tilapia, Catfish, or Shrimp.  They also have chicken wings.  Lunch menu offers a Po-Boy Sandwich that is not on the Dinner menu.   We were lucky to get in early. Two other tables already occupied.   We were nicely greeted by a nice young man. Even took a minute to ask if this as our first time.  When we ordered, it was clear his focus was split between taking orders and getting drinks out to tables already seated.  So distracted, that he forgot to point out the specials dishes of Mac-N-Cheese and Collared Greens.  Unfortunately these are not available as a side dish.   The reviews about it taking a while are NOT exaggerated!!  As I am drafting this review I am going on 20 minutes. And the large table next to us who was seated when we walked in are just getting food. And it is coming out one plate at a time for a party of five.  We finally got our food in front of another table that had also been seated before us about 30 minutes after ordering.   Our orders were for the Catfish plate. Three pieces Catfish, 2 Side Dishes and 6 "Critters" (their version of hush puppies.)  My sides were Potato Salad and Coleslaw.  Girlfriend had fries and coleslaw.  Fries were mushy cold when they came out.  Hush puppies also cold.  Catfish was hot.  Pieces ranged from nice and meaty to very thin with little meat.  They were very small pieces. I would not call them fillets but more fingers strips.  Potato Salad was o.k. to me but not the best. Coleslaw was nothing special either. I also ordered 6 Wings - spicy.  They were not spicy and not very good.  They were fatty and lacked flavor.    Our total meal ticket was $38.00 for the two of us. $13.00 for the Catfish plate and $6.00 for the Chicken Wings.  Queen Creek is in need of new restaurants.  And a good restaurant will make a killing!!  This location is tucked into a back corner with little visibility.  So the only they have going is quality.   For me there always has to be a balance of quality vs. cost  vs. speed.  I don't mind waiting a few extra minutes if it is good.  But fried food should not take 30 minutes to get out.  And if it does, it better be exceptional.  I also don't mind paying a pricey amount if it is good.  But again, this was not.   I doubt I will go back.  If it is still open in 6 months, maybe will give it a second chance on have a Po-Boy for lunch.  But then again....

Visited 12/7/13  Our visit on this day was extremely disappointing. From quality of food to the overall service there is nothing that stands out about our visit that would want to make me return.   We went with a group of people celebrating a friends birthday.  As a result, the organizer had reservations for us.  A group of about 12-14 was scheduled.  I was very disappointed that with this planned reservation, the restaurant was only able to seat us when everyone arrived.  Thereby spoiling the potential surprise element of the party.  And the table arrangement had us seated at a long rectangle table next to a 6 foot round.  Looking around, I did notice other long tables (or square tables with folding leafs.)  So it is too bad that even with a reservation, this was the best table arrangement they could provide.   Once seated, it was clear within about 5 minutes that the wait staff were out of their element.  The initial waitress introduced another who would be helping.  I am not sure if I really every saw the same two faces.   They tried to take drink orders. I ordered a follow up beer to the one I got at the bar waiting to be seated.  This never showed up until halfway into my meal when I was asked if I wanted another. My response of course, "I am still waiting for the one I ordered previously."  They brought an extra wine drink that originally we thought no one ever ordered. Only a few days later in the course of conversation did we figure out that the waitress brought it to the wrong person. Instead of figuring out where it needed to go, left sitting in front of the wrong person. And several people including myself ordered waters (which never managed to show up until well into the meal also.) Why a nice place like this just doesn't service water to begin with is beyond me?  The menu notes that meals are served with endless supply of the Honey Wheat Bread.  The table of 10 was given two baskets of bread. The loaves so small that they did not serve everyone at the table.  We never saw another basket, never had an offer from anyone to bring more and really never get a chance to flag a waitress down to request again. If it is endless, they that should be the case.  At minimum, at least make sure that the first round will service the whole table??  Seems like this, like water, should be something that is automatic??   My girlfriend and I both had soup. She had Broccoli Cheddar.  I had the Lobster/Shrimp Chowder.  In both cases, the soups were luke warm at best.  Taste was o.k.  But lost because it really was not a hot soup.   I had the Porterhouse for 2 with girlfriend. 30 ounce with two sides and two salads. Also includes table side steak sauce.  Now I know that the meat is weight based precooked.  But I have a very hard time believing this was a 30 ounce.  And it was a very large bone so I know I paid for that more than meat.  It was cooked correctly, Medium.  But again, came out warm only.  It clearly had been sitting.  I also had similar comments from other people at the table.  Appears that maybe there was a problem timing the order of the table correctly??  Salads were a very basic house salad. Drenched in Ranch.  I had the Sweet Potato with butter and cinnamon sugar.  It was barely cooked and only barely warm.  It was hot at some point because all the butter melted and ran off - because it was not cooked enough to soak in.  Girlfriends bake potato did not taste baked - but microwaved.  And it was just barely warm also.   We did not want to try dessert. After everything else, we were ready to leave.   As a final kicker, one the people at our table actually expressed service concerns and issues to waitress and asked for a manager.  Manager came over and I overheard her expressing concerns about service and issues.  The gist of the conversation was "thank you for letting us know."  No offer to discount, no free drink, no free dessert.  Nothing that would encourage me to want to come back again.   A table of ten, this was at least a $300 sitting for the able.   Overall, very disappointed.  There is nothing about my meal or experience that would have me return. There are many other steak places that I have had better experience at including the competitor that is just across the street from this location.  Further, given their lack of table options, would not recommend for a large group that cannot fit around a round or square table.

This location just opened within the last month.  The location is new and very clean.   We went there about 4:30.  They were running a special, all plates $2.00.   Was very concerned that there were many dishes on the belt and not many people in the restaurant.  Also concerned that they were not marking the time on the cards so you can determine how long the dish had been running around on the belt. There were some dishes that clearly did not look like they were fresh.  When avocado is turning brown, that might be an indication??  And when we asked the server why they were not marking the cards, his only response was, "They are supposed to be."  We had a couple of plates that were questionable.  Ended up limiting ourselves to the dishes that came around that the chef just prepared or we saw were just set out.   Overall, this was not a very good sushi experience.  For someone that is experiencing sushi for the first time, this might be their last two.  I agree with one other reviewer..  There are other good conveyor belt type of places.  Don't be discouraged if this was your first experience.    Probably will not return. This place made a horrible impression...!!!

Hello Downtown Sushi favorite!!!  Meeting with a friend from out of town that was staying in downtown. I have seen this location but not been here before.  It is located in the Cityscape area. Behind Tilted Kilt. Next to Ice Arena for anyone trying to figure out where it is at.   I was extremely impressed with service and food. Had too many rolls to remember. The sashimi platter had several different cuts of great fish.   Pricing was very comparable to what I have experienced at many other locations.   The bottled beer choices were a little disappointing. I enjoy the Japanese Beers and they had limited.  Would love to see them expand this part of menu.   Got so involved, so quickly, we forgot to take photos.   This will be a regular for downtown.  Looking forward to my next trip downtown to return.  Would also be a great place to sit outside before baseball game and watch light rail go by..

First time visit. New to this location. Will be very excited if this location does well.   Impressed with my first visit. Had the Arizona Burger. Would have liked more jalapeños, but was good. Fries are thin cut and crispy. Will try the smash fries next time.   Jury still out to see if they can maintain this level. But I am a fan now!!
