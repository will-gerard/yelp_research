This was my first visit to Southwest Dental in Chandler but it was definitely one of by best dental experiences yet. I had no wait do to the number of dentist on staff and everyone one there was very professional, polite an talkative. The only negative I could say is the admin staff did lose my insurance info but now that I'm in their system it shouldn't be an issue again.

I will have to admit that when I was scheduled for back surgery and had to go out to Thunderbird Medical I had my concerns. My doctor (Spinal Surgeon) works out of the Phoenix hospital and thunderbird. This hospital was extremely clean and the staff couldn't have been nicer and more professional. I would recommend this hospital over most of the others in the valley. The only downside I would day is the the food could be better but that kind of goes with most hospitals.

I absolutely love this place. They have the best pizza in the phoenix area and though you are almost guaranteed a 30-45 min wait on a slow night it is completely worth it and they also have a great wine bar next door to help you pass your time waiting.

the beer and food are good but the fact that this place allows smoking period is completely unacceptable.

Most of the time I really like this place but had a really bad experience today with their "rules" which has never been an issue before. We brought our coffee rush coffee with us and sat down like many other times just to be told we had to either leave or take our coffee and put it in the car. Mind you I still ordered an OJ with breakfast but they didn't care! Gonna have to say probably not coming back, I'll take my business downtown chandler.

I have been here a few times over the past few years and decided to come here one more time before leaving for Colorado.   Best decision I made with respect to food! There is a new menu and it was amazing! The group I was with had lamb, burger, duck, calamari, pork belly and a salad. All of it was completely amazing! I may have taken from everyone   The service was good not a long wait and wine selection seems to be better than most.   Prefect place for a date night, group event or just a beer because they have a nice bar area.   Cheers!

really like this place, it has great food and will have their own beer soon. the birds and roof top bar are very entertaining as well. the only downside to this place is they allow smoking which is ridiculous people!!
