When I walked into this Walmart tonight, I was thinking about how I was going to write a review about how this place is normally not as clean as a Target. But, tonight was different. It felt and did look clean. Floors were nice and white. What was even better, was an employee in electronics. She was very friendly, mad conversation, and helped me with what I needed!

We really like taking our dog here. The owner Terry is our groomer, and she does an excellent job taking care of our dog. When are dog gets there, she seems happy to walk in and take a seat. When we come back to pick her up, she looks relaxed, as well as a nice haircut. We have been going here for about over a year now, very pleased!

I ordered one taco, just wanted a quick bite to eat. The taco is what I expected it to be. The service here really wasn't the best I have had. I was kind of disappointed. I went through the drive-thru, they have two windows, one to pay and one to pickup. I went to the first window to pay. I saw the worker inside the window, but it took her awhile just to even realize I was there. I've been to other company's drive-thru and they open the window right away and say hello. If they are too busy to take your money, they say something. Here, she opened the window after awhile and just said the total. No hello or anything else.

My friend has brought me here a couple times, only on Mondays for trivia. Team Trivia is quiet entertaining, I must say. It's free to play, which is a nice bonus. If you want a good laugh, each team makes their own name up, some inappropriate, but funny though. I have ordered food, it's not bad, for bar food.

I do enjoy coming to this banking center. There is a friendly staff and the lines are usually not too long. I prefer using the drive-thru ATMs, because this bank has them updated to deposit cash and checks, with no envelopes! I've never had a bad experience here!

I have to say, this is one of my favorite stores. Aside for the great products that they sell, this store offers a lot. The staff are very friendly, happy to help out with any questions. The store is very clean and feels open too. I've been to the Genius Bar before, for a few of my products, and they make it easy to take care of any issues. Can't wait to go back!

It's difficult to say anything bad about this place. Even when it's busy, which is always, there service is always efficient and I'm not waiting any longer than most other "fast food" restaurants. I remember this restaurant when being in Chicago, very happy it's the same great quality out in Arizona now!

This place is nice, except when it's a weekend night. It is way too crowded in there. The line didn't take too long to get in, but it feels like they honestly let way too many people inside. That makes the experience worse. Getting pushed around, having no personal space at all. When trying to navigate over to the bar and back to your friends, that's a long process.

For $10 a month, it's a pretty good deal I think. This gym is pretty new and you can tell by all the nice clean new equipment. All the staff I have talked to are very friendly and easy going. I enjoy working out at this gym, it doesn't ever seem to be crowded. It's nice not to have to wait for a machine.
