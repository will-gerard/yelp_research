I truly enjoy this place.  I took my boyfriend here and he couldn't get over how great it was.  We drank beer, ate dinner, met great people, and danced.  I have always stood in line to order food in which you always have long line but Saturday night we decided to get a table and have dinner.  The burgers are great here and that is what my boyfriend had but I had the flat iron steak.  It was a fabulous choice and it was cooked to perfection.  Our service was fabulous and the band was awesome.  This is a great time.  Block off 2 to 3 hours to fully enjoy the experience and make sure you get there early if you want a table in front of a fire pit.

This place is always amazing.  Talk about consistency.  I eat here at least once a month ever since they opened.  I also drive over 40 minutes just to have lunch or dinner here and it is well worth the drive.  The seafood is always fresh and the staff is so nice.  We brought friends with us last night and they loved it.  Everything except the caesar and soup is fantastic.  The portions are huge so keep that in mind.  If you want seafood in the valley you cant beat this place.  Try the shrimp or the steamed clams for an appetizer and split the pan roast combo for dinner.

Sadly, I cant give 0 stars.  I have never experienced such poor service.  I paid to have my car detailed.  I dropped it off yesterday at 9am and they told me they would phone me when it was finished.  Low and behold at 6:15 I called to find out that they closed at 5:30.  I then phoned the convenient store.  They told me they had the keys.  When I arrived I found my passenger seat soaking wet, the back seat had never been washed, the writing that they put on the window was still on it,  they left a sponge in the back of the SUV,  and from what I could tell in the dark all of the silver on the outside of the car was spotted.  I left the car there after speaking to the convenient store manager.  He said he would leave Mike, the car wash manager, a note to call me first thing in the morning.  Well at 10am I phoned Mike and he was too busy to talk to me.  I asked for the corporate office number and phoned them.  I left a detailed message for the GM and was assured he would call me.  At 12pm I phoned the store again and Mike was too busy to speak with me again.  I then phoned the corporate office and I was assured the GM would phone me immediately.  AS OF 12:25pm 27 hours later I still don't know if my car is ready to be picked up because no-one at Dannys can tell me.

Wow---what a delight this place is.  I seriously cant believe this place isn't standing room only.  My boyfriend and I ate dinner here after church on Sunday. I tried the seafood risotto for $13.00 and I can tell you this "It was worth $26.00."  Every bite had seafood in it.  There was octopus, clams, and shrimp.  The flavor was beyond incredible.  My boyfriend had the canneloni which was amazing.  The sauce was full of flavor and they make the pasta onsite.  I can tell you this the name of this restaurant might have pizza in it but you are seriously missing out if you dont order these two dishes.  Our waiters name was Anthony, who is from New York, and he made our dinner an experience.  We are going back tonight with 8 people for my sons birthday.  This is the best Italian food in the valley hands down.

Wow, this place is off the chart amazing for Italian food.  The prices are incredibly reasonable.  Everything was made to order in the kitchen by the owner Sal.  He does not skimp on quality and you can taste it in the dishes he prepares.  I am so picky about Italian food and this is the best in Arizona.  I truly felt like I was in little Italy in New York eating at 5 star restaurant that has been open for over a hundred years.  After speaking with Sal I know why.  His family is from Italy and his grandmother and mother taught him how to cook Italian food at a young age.  After years of training in the restaurant industry He and his wife decided to take a leap of faith and open up this restaurant 7 months ago.  It doesn't matter where you live in Arizona, You have to make this a must stop!  We tried The Amatriciana(absolutely incredible), the porcini raviolis, chicken parmesan, and this cheese stuffed pastry dessert, which was to die for.  We also ordered the calamari, but not fried, saut√©ed in a red sauce that was exquisite.  This wasn't on the menu but we asked to have this made.  I am looking forward to taking the next cooking class he offers and attending a wine dinner in the future.  Don't forget to take a loaf of bread home for sandwiches or French toast the next day. And most importantly they do 50% off bottles of wine on Tuesdays.  We had the Vitiano, Italian Blend which was a great bottle with a full flavor.  Enjoy

My boyfriend and I came here after church on Sunday and sat on the patio.  The server took a while to get to us but the drinks were worth the wait.  We had the lemon tini's and it was amazing.  The flavor was tart, sweet and the froth stayed at the top.  The pour was definently short for a martini but the happy hour price made that okay.  We also tried the beet salad.  This was amazing. Do not try the calamari --it was super greasy.  All in all we will make this a regular stop.
