My first LGA experience...won't be back unless someone begs me. Omelette was served cold, too busy to care what the plate looked like and no silverware clean. The place was packed. Why?

Gave it a second chance this morning after management reached out to me following my last review. BTW...that was very much appreciated. Thank you!!  From 1* to 4*!! The biggest difference this time was the crowd. Much better help ordering with less customers this morning. The food we ordered came out HOT and quick and tasted awesome. I'm still not a huge fan of the layout...a little crowded (even with less people) around the counters.   I will keep coming back if this experience is repeated.

Called in tonight for take out. We were told our small order would take 50 minutes...huh? That's awhile! Then learned it would take 80 minutes. 80 minutes for take out! Sorry. There is better food elsewhere.
