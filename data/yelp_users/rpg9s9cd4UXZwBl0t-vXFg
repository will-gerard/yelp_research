My favorite Mexican joint of all time. Been coming here for over 20 years and never had a bad experience. Service is always warm and friendly. I've tried most of the menu and my favorites are the machaca dinner and the chile rilleno. Nothing fancy, nothing over the top; just great, authentic Mexican food.   The place can get extremely busy at lunch time. I love placing pickup orders and grabbing them on my way home.   Wish all Mexican food could be like this. It's just perfect. Every. Single. Time.

Took my girlfriend to dinner here tonight and had a lovely meal. Service was excellent; our server Sam was helpful and attentive but not overbearing. Helped us with wine selections and was a great server.   The food was fantastic. My girl had had the butternut squash ravioli in cheese sauce which was light, creamy and full of flavor. I had the lasagna and was happy. It wasn't amazing but definitely a good meal. Salads and bread came before the meal and were perfect.   The only thing about this place we didn't like was the decor and general ambiance. Weird, mismatching decor with strange musical selections and a weird layout was a bit off putting but that being said, we will be back.

Simply amazing. Every little detail was perfect from the temperature of the soup to the spiciness of the sauce. I got the Vegetables and Rice with medium spice and it was perfect. The soup that came with the lunch special was amazing.   The sweet n sour sauce is off the hook.   Our waitress was knowledgeable and able to help my girlfriend decide on what to get. Always had what we needed.   Ambiance is great. Nice and quiet and mellow. A perfect way to relax and eat.    All this for $17 + tip to feed 2 people till they were about to explode?!   We will be back...a lot.

Been going here for a little over 2 years and the owners feel like family. The food is always amazing and fresh, the owners are super friendly. You can tell the little lady gets joy out of making her food for people and she is damn good at it.   I recommend the Pho, Vegetarian fried rice with veggies, Orange Peel Chicken and the Angry Chicken. Oh yeah, and the spring rolls are killer.

Hands down one of my favorite sandwich shops in the Valley. I don't eat meat often but Dilly's is one of those places that I "cheat" for because it is so good. Never had a bad experience, will continue going for a long time.

Still my favorite sandwich in the Valley. They closed the location bear me in North Phoenix so I drive to Tempe to get my fix. The Club and Dilly Bird are our go to Sammies.

My go to watering hole. Spent many a nights  here with friends and family shooting pool, darts, and spending too much money on the jukebox.   It is a great dive and has all the highlights of one. Dingy bathrooms, drunken regulars hitting on you and your friends, cigarette vending machine and a bartender that'll pour you a mean drink.  No frills, no drama, just a good time for a fair price. They have good bar food. Crystal and Marty work Friday and Saturday and I have never found a bartender that can compete with either of them.   I go to a lot of bars. This is the BY FAR the best of the lot.

Decent lil Mexican place. Nothing amazing but better than Filibertos and other "fast food" Mexican. Happy hour from 3-6 is decent. Perfect for a light meal and margaritas after work.

Ordered our food with a very annoyed girl that rolled her eyes as we tried to order and wasn't in the slightest bit helpful. I most certainly get better service at any Taco Bell in the Valley. Paid 16 bucks for two SMALL burros with no chips, no drinks, no sides, nothing.   Our to-go food took forever. At least 4 tables that came in after us got their food and started eating before we left. When our order was ready a girl came up and basically mic dropped our food onto the counter and yelled our name then walked away. I grabbed the food and wanted to ask about chips but despite the 7 girls "working" the front counter no one acknowledged me till I felt awkward and just left.   What a mess. I don't even know if the food tastes bad or I'm just too annoyed to enjoy it.   + 1 star because my girlfriend says "I am equally annoyed but the deliciousness is diffusing the situation."   Won't be back.

There are few places I'll rate 5 stars and even fewer I will travel across state lines to eat but Cafe Forte is one of them.   First the food: quite literally the best meal I've ever eaten out. I has the meatloaf and it was out of this world. Like...I doubt I'll ever eat meatloaf anywhere else; sorry grams. My girl had the Horseradish Salmon so I got a bite or five and it was excellent; I don't even like salmon. Dessert was A perfect ending. Had pumpkin pie which was tasty but pretty standard. The chocolate tart blew my brains out; I almost cried when it was all gone.   The service: Neal was the man. Ask for him of you come through, you won't be disappointed. He was quick, knowledgeable, funny and engaging without being overwhelming. Pacing of dinner was excellent. I was never rushed and never waiting.   Perfect location right in the middle of the art district for a lovely date. The four owners Syd, Grace, Rosemary and Pat are great hosts and make the place that much more love able.   By and far one of my favorite places to eat in Arizona. Don't miss out.

Took my girlfriend here on a Friday night for some food and drinks. Was moderately busy but not slammed by any means.   Service was ok. Slow but all my drinks came out and food came how I ordered it (ish). Neither my server nor the bartender knew what tequilas they had. She could "only remember Don Julio" which was $12 a shot.   Food was meh. I got a burger that was terribly overcooked, even for a bar. My girl got some fish tacos that looked beautiful and she liked a lot. Appetizers were pretty bland and not that hot.   Drinks are what really killed me here. I had a pint of beer, 3 margaritas, a shot and finished my girls drink and left with a slight buzz. For spending $60 on booze I was pretty disappointed with my level of intoxication.   Bottom line: I spent $120 last night for a crappy meal, mediocre service and watered down drinks. Won't be going back even tho I live a quarter mile away.

Short version: Great service, great coffee. Food was cold and took forever despite the place being dead.   Long version: Got a late breakfast with my girlfriend here today. This review is for breakfast food only, we didn't try the rest of the menu. The place was absolutely dead when we went in maybe 5 people in the entire place.   Service was quick, coffee stayed full, check came quickly and we never were really in need of anything. Waitress did a great job keeping us happy.   Food was disappointing to say the least. My girlfriend got a "country breakfast" which came with eggs (perfectly  cooked over easy), biscuits and gravy and sausage. Gravy was runny and tasteless, biscuits min were TINY. Sausage was burned on outside and barely warm in inside.   I got a "french toast sandwich" that wasn't actually a sandwich at all. I expected a breakfast sandwich and was excited only to be let down. I got 3 slices of cold french toast, like not even slightly warm, a piece of burned sausage, and side of eggs (also perfectly cooked). Not sure why its called a sandwich at all.  Food took forever. Thinking maybe it got finished then sat in the window for 20 minutes to get cold? Not sure what took so long. Place was empty and ita breakfast food. I literally could have made the entire meal myself in less time.

Delicious coffee, always great service despite being busy, prices are fine and haven't found anything g o didn't like.   The chef and cooks here kbow what they are doing. Eggs always come out stunning and exactly how I ordered, even more difficult kinds (poached comes to mind). Food is hot, beautifully presented and excellently cooked. What more could a guy ask for?

Yum. So many choices it is hard to figure out what I wanted. Ended up with the S'more Sundae. While it was good, it was WAY too sweet and rich for me. I only ate a third of it before I had to throw the rest away. I imagine a girl after a crap breakup would be in heaven with that beautiful monstrosity.   Next time I'll try something a bit more tame. There will definitely be a next time though :)

I love this place. Friendly and easy experience every time. Online ordering is easy. Always quick and have whatever I need or am craving at the moment. Love that they are open late and they have saved me from many a hangover lol.

I love this place. It's quick and easy, can sit there and basically build the pizza yourself. Glad to have one so close. The owner is usually there and the staff are always clean and polite. Almost all the pizzas are under  10 bucks and they give a lot of coupons.   The pizza itself is pretty damn good. I like the thin crust and the regular. Never tried the stuffed because ya usually just me. The side are pretty good as well.

My girlfriend and I were nearby waiting for our car to be repaired and happened on this place for lunch. The vibe of the place is cool, nice decor and overall ambiance. Unfortunately, that is about the only good thing I can say about our experience.   Service was terrible. Waitress came over once to get our order and once to drop the check. The rest of the time she was chatting by the bar and generally ignoring us. Ran out of water halfway through and never got more.   The food was...weird. I love BBQ and really wanted to love theirs but couldn't. My sandwich was cold and had been sitting awhile, while my girlfriends was so hot she couldn't eat it for 10 minutes.  There was finally a warm bite in the very center of my sandwich. I'd bet my paycheck they used a microwave on both. The fries were cold and gross.   I really wanted this to be a new "hidden gem" near my home but instead was left wishing I had got Jack In The Box across the street. At least then my food would be hot and I would get decent service.

Always loved their happy hour specials. One of the best black bean burgers I've ever had. Their Kafta Burger hit the spot as well.   Bartender served us tonight and didn't have any good recommendations for beer which kind o blew my mind but the food was delicious, atmosphere was cool and service was adequate.
