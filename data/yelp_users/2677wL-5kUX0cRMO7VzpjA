Open 24 hours - only thing that rates a star; pharmacists lack customer service, time management, and efficiency skills

Great atmosphere and service. Fresh, home cooked breakfast with house made blueberry preserves for the yummy while-wheat toast. I had the scrambled eggs with salami - the salami reminded me of our trip to France. My husband had traditional eggs and bacon. The bacon is thick and peppered. I had the famous home fries - potatoes, onions, and fresh rosemary - great flavor an huge portion. I will ask for a small side next time! I hope Yelp updates the address - they've moved a few doors down. Try out Matt's Big Breakfast next time you are downtown in Phoenix.
