Never rated a place this low before. Bad start... It was very slow and yet it took forever for our server to come to our table. The decor was a throwback to the 80's, and probably that was when it was done and never updated. The menus came with dried up food on mine. They eventually came and brought us typical chips and awful salsa. It was served in q maple syrup dispenser and had the consistency of tomato paste. You couldn't pour it so you had to remove the top and scoop it out with a spoon. It tasted a little like flavored tomato paste as well. When our server came by we asked for a drink menu and he pointed to his head, as if to say all we needed to do is ask and he would recite it to us from memory. We asked what is good here and he grinned and said "margaritas", to which we asked what kind. He began to recite flavored, and we said we wanted a top-shelf, he really didn't know what we were talking about so we ordered the non-flavored with salt on the rocks. It came out and was perhaps one of the most typical standard margarita mixed drinks with very little tequila. We mistakingly at that pint decided to stay and ordered a combination plate, split. They split it, but instead of splitting both items they gave my wife one and me one and only one set of utensils. He asked what kind of sauce, we said green but on the side. The green sauce came later when we were ready to leave. The food was really diner fare and while not awful, not something to write home about. We chose not to finish and instead took our check to the counter and paid with Apple Pay, which was the only redeeming part of the visit. We should have trusted our first instinct and left as soon as we walked in.

Absolutely love this optometrist. Dr Hostetler is terrific; prescriptions always perfect and they are very good at keeping the appointments on time.

Amazing food... I had a veal parmigiana that brought me back to my youth in New York. The service was phenomenal... Ask for Dana she was great. Not too obtrusive, kept our cups full and made great wine recommendations. And Joe is such a great cook and host - made the visit fun for our whole family.

Great experience on a happy hour on a Wednesday evening. The service was great (Liz was amazing ask for her) and the food came out hot and fast. She knew everything about the food and drinks and made great recommendations. She even anticipated our needs before we asked... What a great experience thank you!
