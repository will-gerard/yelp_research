Anyone who doesn't rate this 5 stars doesn't understand steakhouses. In a world full of exotic, overpriced, over the top frilly steakhouses, Stockyard's keeps things the way they should be. Can you go somewhere else and pay more for a steak that may or may not have been blessed by a Japanese Rabbi? Probably. But why would you?  If you appreciate the old school, high quality steakhouse this is the place. Not the least bit pretentious, walking in you will immediately realize that Stockyard's is a true Arizona experience, and pays homage to it's own wild west heritage throughout the restaurant.   Now, let's not misconstrue this: it's still a damn nice restaurant. What Stockyard's does so well, however, is be true to Arizona in that while the place feels like a special experience, you won't feel out of place whether you are wearing a jacket, your golf outfit or your cowboy boots.   I suppose you aren't reading these reviews to find out if you can wear your boots, so let's talk about the food. I have tried at least 1/2 of the menu, and can't say a single bad thing about it. When they run the baseball cut on special, do NOT pass it up! I am a huge fan of baseball cut steak, and this one is the best there is. I am not a big fan of filet, so if I am going off the regular menu I usually go with the NY or the prime rib if I m feeling like prime rib.  The best thing about Stockyards hands down is the value for the food and service you receive. It's not cheap, so don't expect to walk out with a $20 steak, but for what they do charge you are getting far more for your money than the other allegedly "esteemed" steakhouses in town. Your dinner includes fresh veggies and dip as an appetizer, fresh bread (which is superb), a salad, and a starch of your choice on top of your choice of meat. How many places even offer that anymore? And did I mention that their steaks easily rival the more expensive guys in town?   To top it off, their wine and drink selection is top notch. Service has always been excellent, and their servers and bartenders extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  If you are looking to spend some money on a steak, and want the best quality, value and experience for your money, this is the only choice in Phoenix.

This place is an Arizona classic. Will I am partial to their taco lunch special (yeah, I'm basic), their red chile is absolutely to die for. Great margaritas too. Always go with the top shelf, you won't regret it!

There is one reason I frequent place, and the only reason I need: perfect NY style cheese pie. Seriously, it rivals any pie out of NYC. I am sure the rest of the menu is good, but that cheese pizza? That's all I need.

I have been dining here since I was a child when it first open. They have consistently had great Chinese food, and their sushi is always fresh and they have some nice unique rolls on the menu. Service has always been great, and the owners are very hands on and supremely gracious. It's tough to achieve consistency for as long as they have, but they have done it well.

Probably the worst Filiberto's in the chain. The salsa is basically water, ketchup and chili powder. Far too many good mexican places in this town to bother with this dump.

This is how a great local bar should be run. This place has a long, unique history in town and is truly the "local dive" that everyone knows and loves. Current ownership has taken it to the next level by hiring fantastic staff and running a great bar. Food is available during limited hours, but is all outstanding. If you are a local looking for a fun place to hang out, or passing through and want to tie one on and hear some live music and party with the locals on the weekend, this is the place to be.

Not that this review will matter to them, as most HOA Management Companies are widely regarded as the scourge of the earth, but I felt it necessary to share my recent experience with these fine folks   I am not home much between two jobs and travelling, but I have my front yard sprayed to prevent weeds regularly. I received a call yesterday from my landlord asking if I had received a letter from them informing me that the HOA had sent a weed notice out. I was completely blown away by this, as I hadn't even noticed anything in my yard.   I arrived home late at night as usual and scoured my front yard for weeds, to find a grand total of 2 weeds. One was one of the small "ground cover" types and one was about 3 inches tall and less than the size of my fist. They were so small I hadn't even noticed them pulling into my driveway yet.   Needless to say, PMG, in this instance, appears to be yet another management company that seeks the smallest issues to justify their existence and fees charged to homeowners. Stay classy!

I am a little surprised by the low average for this place. In its current incarnation it is a modern American restraint that still carries an interesting interior vibe from the late 80s when the place was built. Architecturally unique, it has a dark, modern feel with some warm copper and wood touches.   The menu rotates and is a single page, but there is something for everyone on there. Presentation is modern but moderately enough to remain appealing to the masses. The current chef has mastered the savory / sweet options, which is highlighted by the chicken donuts appetizer. Everyone on our group enjoyed their meals and from the the different entrees I was able to sample it was unquestionable why.  What really impressed me was the service. We had a very large table (I think 16) right around the beginning of their dinner rush on a Friday night and they did a fantastic job with keeping up with drinks as well as helping people of various levels of culinary experience choose their meals. Most impressively, they were able to get everyone's meal out very close together in time (took about 3-4 minutes to get everyone's entrees on the table) which is nearly an impossible feat with a table that large.   The mixed drinks are a bit pricey but this isn't a cheap spot, so I am not going to dock them rating for that. Overall a great experience!

Drinks. Pools. Hot Tubs. Brunch. Awesome service staff. Comfortable beds. The occasional set of awesome plastic breasts in bikinis. Chuck-a-duck. Get a room, hit the pool and find Guillermo to bring you drinks. You're welcome.

Stopped by here late on a Sunday night to get some food. Driving in I wasn't expecting much, but sometimes the dirtiest girl can turn out to be a prize.  Make no mistake: this is a dive bar through and through. From the outdated everything inside, to the hidden parking behind the building.   That being said, there were really two things that stood out to me for the short time I was there: the enclosed smoking area and the food.  The smoking area IS a patio, but it is connected to the bar by a roll up garage door, and there is cover and ventilation that make it feel like you are inside. The ventilation pulls the smoke out and keeps the bar from getting a smoke smell throughout. Very cool for those of us who hate being relegated to the alley to smoke under the current smoking laws.  The food here was absolutely fantastic. The wings were 9/10 in both flavors we had (hot and honey hot), the pizza was tasty and made from very high quality ingredients (thick hand tossed crust that is crispy where it counts and light and airy inside). The burgers also looked to be on fresh artisan type buns and my friend who had one said it was outstanding.   All in all, if you like dive bars it's worth a look, especially if you are looking for late at night.

This isn't anything fancy. It's not going to win an award for decoration or ambiance. But for what it is - mariscos - it is fantastic. The staff was also very friendly and helpful with suggestions and explanations of different items. If you like scrimps then you will enjoy this little spot!

I had heard all sorts of good things about this place. They were mostly wrong. I would say this place is overrated and overpriced. The $10 crunchy spicy tuna roll came with four - yes 4 pieces and the spider roll was extremely plain. The happy hour is supposedly good, but the normal prices are not worth the fare. Our server probably couldn't get into ASU if she cheated. With the sheer amount of sushi options in the east valley, I won't be going back.

As far a Deli's go, the East Valley is really lacking. Luckily Z Cafe is here to save the day. Everything is made fresh at the counter right in front of you from premium ingredients. The prices for what you get are absolutely outstanding. I recommend the Manhattan Club.

For those of you looking at the low average rating: ignore it. The rating is based on the OLD Tropicana, which I had walked through once in the past, and THIS is not the old Trop.   First off, the hotel remodel is nearly complete. When it is done, I think I may reconsider my four star rating and give it a five. The rooms are very nice, but obviously not Bellagio or Encore nice. Beds are comfortable, and the pillows are awesome. Pillows often get overlooked at hotels, or are not replaced often enough. Being that these are brand new right now, they are top notch.  The Casino floor is very small and intimate. It is bright and inviting, unlike a lot of floors in Vegas. I didn't have much success, but a lot of people around me did. Really though, I never stay and gamble where I sleep, I like to get out and play everywhere, especially at the looser casinos downtown, and the Coast casinos.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and when we had any issues, they were immediately taken care of.  One thing I liked was that it was definitely a younger crowd, and we were lucky enough to be there when there was a college women's volleyball tournament going on. Yeah, that worked out.  There are a few drawbacks right now, I would say chalked up to what seems to be working out the kinks in the system. Our rooms were supposed to have 2 beds, and they did not. To make up for it they comped our first night and moved us in the morning.   Cafe Nikki was not what it should have been for the price. I think it may have been more poor execution in the kitchen that night. The wine list was a bit overpriced for what was supposed to be the "mid-level' restaurant at the hotel.  Lastly, the pool is fantastic, and is going to be even better once Nikki Beach is done. One drawback: no outside beverages allowed AT ALL. they want to sell you their beer. Who am i to argue?   Overall, for the money this place is 100% worth it. Hopefully they don't do like other remodeled hotels do when they are done and get full of themselves and jack up prices (ahem, Planet Hollywood).

Great NY style pizza, and FREE DELIVERY. Sorry chain pizza places, I have finally found a legit replacement. Best deal is their 18" giant cheese pizza for 9.99 every day.

It is amazing to me how many eateries gut stuck with lower average ratings than deserves because of the entitlement and some great expectations that people pull straight from their imagination. In order to accurately review anything, you have to take it from the perspective and concept that is being offered.  So what is Holsteins? Holsteins is a casual, semi-gourmet burger joint with great late night hours, incredible appetizers, and cocktails and drunken shakes that meet and exceed exactly what they are out to accomplish. And as far as price? Extremely friendly for what you get and the fact that it is in Las Vegas in one of the pricier Hotel and Casinos.  I ended up going in twice on our trip - and both times I had the Gold Standard burger. Sharp cheddar goat cheese? To die for. The burger was so rich and flavorful I couldn't finish it either time.  The shakes? Leave room for one because these are some of the best and most creative shakes out there - and you better get the extra shot. This is Vegas after all.  A couple of suggestions: get the onion rings. The fries are decent but nothing special. However, the hand battered onion rings are in the upper echelon of onion rings I have tried in my lifetime (with the rings at Hodad's in San Diego the undisputed #1).   Lastly, everyone seems to talk about the buffalo dip, but don't shy away from the cheese steak eggrolls - because they are otherworldly. Make sure you set aside time and room in your stomach to go through appetizer, a burger and a shake, because you don't want to miss out on any of it.

John did not build this business from the ground up by accident, and the Yelp reviews don't lie. In a cut-throat market where agents cut corners and conduct questionable business the Gluch Group has built their business on integrity, honesty and hard work. The entire team is extremely responsive, easy to get in touch with, and listened carefully to my specific criteria without trying to push something on me that just wasn't what I was looking for. They made my search easy, and while I have worked with agents that clearly just treat everyone as a number, that is not what I experienced here. Even though I did not end up buying, I was always treated like I was royalty by the entire team. Buying or selling, there is no one in the valley who will be a better ally in the real estate market than John and the rest of the team.

I have not eaten here, but I can tell you this much: this is the best country bar in the east valley. Those giant, overpriced box country bars get old really fast. The live music is always top notch, and the staff and patrons are friendly. I have always had a fantastic time here with friends and meeting new people. More place should follow this model.

Pretty decent menu, some prices seem a bit high but the selection is good. Not many places carry a baseball cut on a regular menu, and at $22 I couldn't pass up my favorite cut of meat. Great wine selection, iffy beer selection. Service was solid, but a bit discombobulated as we were asked if we wanted new drinks three times in about 5 minutes. May have been a shift change or trainee though, as everything else was good. My only real complaint was the texas toast they serve does not really go with the "honey butter" they serve alongside it. Overall, its nice to have a new steak joint in town that offer some quality cuts!

I am not going to rate this less than 2, because the help I have had there on previous occasions has been stellar, and I do love their house juices for the price. Everyone is always extremely nice, and the prices are fair.   Here is the issue: I went in tonight to pick up a new setup and one for a friend of mine, and when I told them that is what I needed, they refused to sell me even a setup for myself. They claimed they have had problems with parents calling in because their underage kids have had stuff from the store, and that it is "illegal" to sell me a vape because I said it was for someone else. They claim they need to card everyone now, and basically said they couldn't sell to me "today."  Here are the problems:  1. I have never been carded in there 2. The vape setup I have was purchased there by the same friend I was trying to buy for today. When he purchased mine for my birthday last year he purchased a total of three setups.  3. The law as they stated is not the law.  Unfortunately for Red Star their paranoia has cost them a loyal customer who hasn't spent a ton of money there, but is close by and has ONLY shopped at Red Star as far as vaping needs.   Get it together guys, treating everyone like gradeschoolers because you are paranoid is only going to cost you business, and it already has.

HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!  Had my phone explode in a near car accident and needed a new screen and battery. Repairman came out to my office, evaluated the phone, went and picked up parts and came back and had my phone fixed within the hour for MUCH less than the Apple store or any of the repair shops I have previously inquired with.

Adam and Natalie are angels sent from above to save your yard from a mundane existence. Quality, unique design and work for prices that will leave you with some money leftover to actually enjoy your new surroundings. Before I called All-Terrain, my yard was a typical rock oven. Now, every time I go in my back yard I feel like a tiny pebble laying in the most serene of zen gardens. You simply cannot go wrong with All Terrain!

As I sit at my desk devouring a mac and cheese stuffed hamburger that was brought to me by a co-worker who shall now be referred to as Hamburger Jesus, I am crying tear of burger salvation. Whoever decided to bless our area with this divine concept should be awarded the Nobel prize for culinary triumph.   But really - if you think the idea of a stuffed burger is good - and getting that stuffed burger for an incredibly reasonable price is even better - this is the place for you.

It's very hard to put a star rating on this one. The food is the same great food you get at the other locations, but this particular location seems to be run by people who think their reputation is all they need. One of the great things about the original location was that you could actually get in and out during a little longer lunch break if you wanted. This location does not care about expediency whatsoever. Our server was doing his best and was very helpful, but it's obvious that he was doing the best he could with poor organizational support. There were constantly people waiting to get in despite open tables inside and outside. It seems clear by the other reviews here this is constant. This wasn't a demand issue: unlike the Scottsdale location which has a ridiculously huge crowd waiting to get in most of the time, the number waiting were fairly small. There didn't need to be a wait at all if management gave a shit about getting people through in a timely manner. You can't survive on brand recognition alone in this business, if they don't get their act together all the money that has gone into the expansion of the brand is going to end up a waste.

Went back in on 6/12/16 and they have really turned this place into a well oiled machine. Seating was faster than the given wait times, food was fast and fresh, and service was absolutely top notch. Management was actively greeting customers and taking care of their staff as well. Great experience and I am glad to see his location running as well as the others. Best fried chicken in Arizona!

A hidden gem with the best draft beer selection in the area. Constantly rotating taps means there is always something new to try. Fantastic service and knowledge on different beers. Oh and the sandwiches? Best value and quality in town with all Boar's Head products. You can't beat it!

A much different type of endpoint transportation. The tuk tuks are the nicest thing on the road when you need to get around old town Scottsdale. Heated seats, audio, and all around a fun experience for a cheap price. They take card too, so no need to dig for cash!

Cool bar in a great old historic building! Very relaxed atmosphere, CLEAN and a great place to relax and have a drink. They keep a rotating selection of very good beer - many from Arizona breweries, and are always coming up with creative new cocktails. Great spot to check out in historic downtown CG!

We ended up at The Brickyard almost by accident - and I am glad we did. We had a group of 7 guys out for a birthday on a late Sunday evening. We had chosen The Perch, but they had inexplicably stopped serving their entire menu other than their late night menu at 8:00 PM.   We walked across the dirt lot and saw the back entrance to The Brickyard and decided to give it a shot. By luck, Gavin (co-owner) was out back and when asked if they were still serving he immediately welcomed us and got us a table set up inside. He explained the menu and concept and talked with us a little about what they were doing at the restaurant.   The menu here is focused on sharing plates - so much so that there are only four entrees listed (more on those later). I have seen this concept attempted before, but often times it falls flat due to poor attention to detail, small portions or bad selection. These guys have it absolutely NAILED. Of the three sharing plates we tried (all were great) the fried artichokes were the crown jewel.  Everyone in our party ordered either the ahi or roasted chicken entrees, except for me. I had the steak - a block cut strip loin. It was pan seared to perfection on the outside and finished in the oven - and had that perfect crystallized crust that adds texture and flavor. One of the best cooked steaks I have ever had.   The cocktail selection is creative, but still accessible with flavors that  will appeal to both the craft cocktail enthusiasts and those who are newer to drinking creatively. I recommend the Tropic Thunder - which is literally served in a closed mason jar with cherry wood smoke floating atop the drink.   The building itself is very basic - the old brick walls and minimalist decor shift the focus to the food and drink presentation and ultimately the quality of the fare itself. The service staff was extremely knowledgeable and having the owner there willing to converse and talk shop and food in general made for a great experience.
