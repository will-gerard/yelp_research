Great pizza. We've been searching for a reliable standby since we moved to Phoenix. It hit the spot. Better than the others in the neighborhood.

We prefer Pizza A Metro now. Tastes great and catches you way off guard. But we'll return on occasion to Slice of Sicily. They still have a fun place and solid food. They know our neighborhood, too, so if you want to keep it local, keep going to Slice of Sicily.

Best wings in Phoenix.  It is better in the winter than the summer. Great music player on wall.

Only eat here if you have a reservation and are staying to eat in the restaurant. The kitchen is very poorly managed. Takeout orders take well over an hour.   The food is good but only because it is being prepared in Phoenix and there is nothing else to choose from. Not really.   If you choose to come here. Just know it will be a very long wait.

Great staff. Decent prices (15 laundered shirts for $26.32). I don't like the 50 cent charge for using a credit card but I get it. Will report back in the condition of my shirts. I really liked the 10% discount from Yelp.

Get $20 from your atm and go down here to pick up some excellent firewood both for cooking and for firepits at the party.   I'd rattle off all the different types of wood but I can't remember them and all that really matters is that good quality cooking wood is here. Not at the other places. Roll up. Give them your $20 and leave with two cords of wood. Solid guys.

Beautiful country and layout. The Saguaro course has wide fairways and still feels challenging.   It is expensive at $105/round and what's frustrating is the terribly slow pace of play. Big foursomes that take too long stacked on top of each other and little room to move. Good thing the views are beautiful. You wind up staring out at the mountains and hitting a shot every 12 minutes. Hard to get in a groove or feel good.   I won't come back unless I can get out earlier and play at 3:45 or 4 hours. I just can't abide a round that starts at 10:40 and doesn't finish until 3:30. Brutal.

BoSa is better. I do like those preservatives pretending to be hash browns though. They're pretty solid.

Review for those looking to buy a car.  This would be 4- or 5-star rating if not for Travis Hart, the Finance Manager. (Why is it that the finance managers at the nicer auto brands are so much more reasonable and accommodating?).  Ray Russo was my salesman and I enjoyed doing business with him; my wife did, too--but when it came time for the dealership to take a closer look at our deal, the Finance Manager Travis Hart came on strong. This is one of the worst things about buying a car, by the way--having to go through a second negotiation after you've spent hours on the first one.  I wanted a pre-owned certified vehicle, which is basically part of GM's warranty program. If it's officially "certified," you have the full backing of the manufacturer.  But Travis Hart talked me into this other warranty program--one that is inferior to me leaving with a certified used vehicle. I'm sure Mr. Hart would defend his actions. He was doing his job. And he was aggressive about it.  The part I didn't like--and that you should watch out for--is that Travis Hart kept going back and forth with me, while my pregnant wife and four-year-old son were forced to keep waiting (I had kept them there for 3 hours before that point).  I had my deal negotiated and done with Mr. Ray Russo.  Watch out when you go in there and Mr. Hart ends up doing his number on you.  Beyond that, I enjoyed the sales floor, the selection. I will send anyone I can find to Ray Russo (which is probably what I'll need to do for finder's fees to recoup the lost money from Travis Hart).

I'm happy to update this review a few days later. General Manager Tim Mort at Chapman Chevrolet is not only straight forward, responsive to customers, understanding and genuine--but he's on Yelp. So he's listening. And he's great to deal with. That says a lot about the team he's assembled at this dealership, too. He trusts his sales folks like Ray Russo. He's hired an outstanding service manager in Jeff Talbot. And Mr. Mort wants to make buying a car easier; he knows that we have more options than ever these days.  Why five stars? Because I cannot imagine buying a car from better guys. I intend to return to Chapman Chevrolet. (And I truly hate having to buy cars; really unpleasant thing, ok?)  After the incident with a finance manager, and a long night, I took our 2012 Tahoe back to the dealership. Mr. Mort had his service team run it through a 175-point inspection and brought it back as a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle. This gives it the backing of the manufacturer up to 48,000 miles (nothing like The General backing the car). He also had his finance team draw up a new contract (so I owe the bank less money now), and I got the same financing as if I had bought a brand new car (nothing like those super-low APRs out there these days).  Most importantly, my wife's very happy, and so are the kids. Mr. Mort was kind and congratulatory about the bonus baby coming our way in a few months, too (which was the whole reason we needed the Tahoe in the first place).  I can't write enough about Ray Russo. Please ask for him if you're in the market for a car. He does thorough research and he speaks the truth when he says he can get you a responsible and honest trade-in value for your car. He does good work and is extremely responsive. He also knows his vehicles. After spending the better part of a month on buying a new car, I can tell you it is exceedingly rare to find sales teams that know their product as well as Ray and his peers at Chapman. And if you happen to see the General Manager Tim Mort down at the dealership, know that he pays attention to what his customers are saying--and he strives to make things right.  Makes sense this place was recently named "Dealership of the Year" by Chevrolet nationally (one of only 12 in the country). I got to sit down and eat BBQ with all the employees yesterday in celebration--while they finalized my deal.  Pretty cool.  Tim, thank you. I'll be back.

Good grief. They call me all the time. Or they gave my number to companies that call me all the time. Constantly wanting me to trade in and trade up. Why? So I can eat the fact that the value of the depreciated? I hate car sales company ethics. Just let me drive a car and get some value for it. Why are you constantly selling?

Took my kids after calling ahead. Was told we could sit in back and eat and not trouble the bar patrons. We arrive and were effectively turned away. They saved tables for regulars. No reservations for new folk. Probably a great place with food and drink and good energy. But the service favors locals; visitors not welcomed, in my opinion and experience.

Luis was fantastic. Came out. Taught me a lot about my unit. Solid guy.  I had purchased a Yelp deal - so I paid $80 for $100 worth of service. I have an old Carrier furnace and a switchboard went out -- very common for this furnace. Luis was helpful. Wired around the board and now my fan is running full-time. Which isn't good. I still need to have more expensive work done. I found a better deal from other guys who could install the board and do the work. So I paid $80 to Yelp. Then another $74 for Luis and his work. Too bad. I could have just paid a $70 service fee to another guy who said he was coming out. I feel like I spent too much here for this service. $174 total. But Luis was a solid guy and I was grateful for his time. You will pay a premium for Cool Touch.

Best restaurant in Phoenix.  Best Chef in Phoenix.  Best Small Business in Arizona.  Best Sushi in The American Southwest. I love this place.  Everyone who works here is the best too.  This is where we go for the event nights when we can escape the kids. We love it. BYOB btw.

I guess I'm not as sophisticated--or I'm lacking some sensory "thing"--but these dishes didn't work out for me. The leeks, the mussels, the rutabaga, the fennel(?), the beet falafel. It was just didn't work out--and I was looking forward to it. I did enjoy dessert--a donut (although it was called something else).  I understand much of what's said by those reviewing favorably. The dishes are unique. They are interesting. There's definitely something creative happening in the kitchen. And I want to be able to love the food. But it didn't work out.  I'm sorry to write that, because by all accounts, people who know good food love this restaurant.

This is the honest guy you need to call first. Call them. Air Express Heating and Cooling. This is a group of people worthy of your business. Trint is world class. They're experts at their craft. They're licensed. Bonded. Trained. They take time to answer questions completely and honestly. Their price cannot be beat. If the fix just requires the service fee, that's what they charge. Not like other companies here in Phoenix that charge the service fee and then layer on additional charges.

I seriously do not know why anyone would deal with anyone but Trint. He is honest. He did great work. He is the best. You are insane if you call someone else. There are so many dishonest hvac guys in this valley.

$15 oil change. These guys were cool. They actually said to me: "One high-mileage Nissan Sentra. Check." And that was it. They didn't ask me about filters or sell-me-up on nonsense. Great scene here. I'll come back.

Ryan J brought me out here and, yes, I brought my A game--went ahead and ordered the Bear: peanut butter, cracker jacks, bacon, gouda and BBQ sauce. It was state-fair-what-did-I-Just-Do? awesome. So good.   The carneys selling overpriced knitting nearby were odd--but we liked the lamps the guys recreating Mad Men were pimping out there.  I don't know anything about these Short Leash Dogs people--but they clearly have something dialed in. The Bear dog was part of some contest put on by the Arizona Diamondbacks. They won, so now it's become a big deal for them.  Ryan J got a different dog. And as he reviewed nearly two years ago: you gotta "unleash your hot dog inhibitions" to get into this place.  Who has hot dog inhibitions? Dumb people, that's who.

Go for Stephen. At the bar. You want to talk? He's interesting. Want to stay buried in your phone? Cool. Want food recommendations and the plate delivered fast? Stephen.   Yes. The kitchen is solid. They know what they are doing back there. But Stephen at the bar. He gets the five star.   Note it.

I can't. My family. Our lives. Meaningless without bosa. We would starve on weekends. My baby only likes me because I get him donut holes.   I can't review this. It has become part of our lives.

Dean K. is right. The owner here clearly had zero interest in serving us. She was bitter and bent out of shape because we had a few kids in shop for all of 4 minutes. Will never come back.  News flash for people out there selling various forms of ice cream or gelatto or whatever----KIDS LIKE YOUR PRODUCT.  So relax when they come inside your store. They're excited about getting ice cream.  I'll come back when the owner changes her tune.

As cake goes, yes, these people know how to make cakes and we keep going back, which is probably going to put me in the hospital. I don't know the story of the founder, owner or people doing the work back there--the bakers. But the product is solid. Felt like creamed butter--or at least lots and lots of butter. The right amount of sugar.  You choose different cake recipes, but the frosting is the same (and good).  I won't bother going to other cake places. Everything here fits the bill. Solid bundt cakes. And they make little ones for pregnant spouses (which, yes, I've made a run for).  Worth the extra dollar, by the way. You want to be "that guy," who shows up with the Safeway baked goods? Don't do that.

It's 10:45pm right now. Just got back from The Stand. They wouldn't serve me. Sorry to write this out (kind of a bummer)---but if you're thinking of a late-night burger, don't bother. They have no interest in serving you. I even called ahead and asked if they'd still make a burger and fries if I drove down. They said, "sure, we don't close 'til eleven.''" I drove down. One of the employees gave me some line about how the drive-thru closes at 10pm some nights. And, yeah...tough luck.  Wondering if the food's any good? Read Ryan J.'s review of 7/13. Because I wouldn't know.  In the meantime, find another late-night burger option.

I won't go anywhere else. My kid loves it too. These guys, Boris and Emmanuel, not only know how to cut a man's hair. They have their space dialed-in, too. The magazines. The A/C jamming. Sports and news on the TV. Good conversation if you want it. Silence and "get the job done" if you don't want the chatter. That they came from Brooklyn and brought the NYC barber sensibility to Phoenix speaks for itself. I'm a fan and I hope they get a nice customer base. Lord knows there are plenty of guys who want a no-nonsense place to get their hair cut, too. Prices are right. They treat kids well, so if you're juggling dad duty, go ahead and expect the candy treats for the kids so they sit there quiet while you get your hair cut.  Straight edge razor? Done. they have that.  They're shomré Shabbat too--so don't try on Saturday. Respect that kind of discipline these days. It's rare, I think. Anyway... I can't recommend these guys highly enough.

Kids loved the cheese pizza. We built our own with carmelized onions, green bell peppers, italian sausage, kalamata olives--it was solid. All fresh. The owners are the same group that founded NYPD until it was sold to owners who stopped going fresh. New York style stuff here at Giant Rustic. They go so far as to match their filtered water with what they had back in Yonkers. That's commitment. Great scene here off Camelback, too. They deliver. Solid place. I prefer it now over all the others that deliver to us.  Again, kids like it. Thank the Lord.  You can also get a slice inside which is key.

I used to use Wes Flinn, RPT, but he moved to Wisconsin. Mr. Lee is a professional and very quick to respond to your requests. He was at my house the day after I contacted him, and he called me within an hour of responding to him. His prices were reasonable and he is local to Phoenix. He'll travel anywhere, too. I will keep him coming to service our piano, an upright Boston (Kawai with Steinway parts).  He was trained by the old-time professional here in the valley, the same guy that trained Mr. Flinn (forgot the guy's name). But Eliot Lee's family is in this business and it's a tuner I highly recommend. Easy going. Willing to explain the process to you; and he'll make clear what you're paying for. Top notch.

Great people. Pizza is crazy good. Thin crust. Interesting flavors and flourish. Great space in the restaurant too. Music. Tables. Lots to offer. My kids were happy. I got the Valencia and loved it (as if anything with chorizo wouldn't be the best).
