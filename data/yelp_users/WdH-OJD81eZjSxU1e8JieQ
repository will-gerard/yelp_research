I was worried to take my dog in after I read all the bad reviews. But I decide to get it a try! I took my dog in for nurturer, and the service & staffs were so nice and acknowledge! I also got my dog pain medicine but he did not even need it! I think for such cheap price with awesome job, I am really satisfied!!!

Seriously!!!! most DISGUSTING place ever! had a hair in the dumpling of the dim sum one time which will be my ever last time to go there! Talked to them with the hair, the services took the one away and come back without an apologize or anything and walk away again. What a nice service and the food made me so sick all day! HAIR in a Dumpling! EWWWW. even the boss was on the services site and said, "well, if she said no then it is no." so that means me, as a customer, is laying? how FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I took my car in last Saturday and purchased a detailed car wash package. It is okay that they did not clean my car well but they broke it! My windshield strip is broken, my car mats stink, and there are still bird poops on top of my car! The service costed me almost $200 and I am not happy with the result at all!

Saw yelp reviews and went to give it a try since it's so closed to my house. Meh... everything tasted so sweet. Meats (two entries - one with chicken one with beef) are smelly and ain't fresh. Small portion of food which it's kinda expensive. Salad and soup were not Thai at all. Will not coming back.
