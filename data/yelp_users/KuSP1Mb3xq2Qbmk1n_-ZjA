If there was a -$ rating for pricing- China Restaurant would get it.  The majority of the menu is  less than $5.  The fact that their food is so cheap actually makes me wonder about some things... but I try to avoid letting my mind wander.  Honestly, their food is mediocre.  I had the house chicken which came with soup, a hefty plate of rice, chicken and an egg roll.  The chicken was a overcooked and drowned in too much sauce as a cover up.  The rice was cooked fine however, and I did enjoy the egg roll and soup.  I went during lunch and they were very busy but the service was super fast. It is really a small space and they don't have much seating however there are a couple of large circular tables in the middle where they will sit anyone who needs a seat.  That's kind of cool to me.  I can imagine it's a good way to meet people that work around the area.  This place is a pushover into the four star realm for me.  If they were ever to raise their prices to be more expensive than McDonalds, it would turn into a 3. But no complaints for right now- if you need a cheap place to eat, this is on the top of my list.

Really good bagel breakfast sandwich. They loaded on the bacon, it was perfectly cooked, and the jalapeno cheese bagel I picked it to be on had a nice flavor. Only downfall was that the food took forever to come out. Vistied on a Sunday morning around 10.

Only bad thing about this place is that during peak times, it gets too busy and things can be slow. Other than that, I love Teakwoods!  Pretzels with Cheese are the bomb!  Very large portions of food - good wings and burgers, great rotating specials and beer options, and who doesn't like to throw peanuts at people? (Er... I mean, throw peanut shells on the ground).

I heard people talk about this place at work a lot. They'd mention grabbing an after work beer and frequenting it quite often since it was so close.  One day a coworker mentioned (since they knew that I was obsessed) that they had fried pickles there and I was gung-ho about going there soon.  That same week my boyfriend mentioned that he would be going there with a group of people that Friday and invited me to come. I was ecstatic.  I was ecstatic until the moment the GPS turned us into a very familiar parking lot of a very shady establishment.  I was suddenly reliving a repressed experience from about a year prior.  The experience had been so bad, I had forgotten the name of the place all together.  Skip and Jan's sounds so lighthearted, friendly, and inviting.  It is not.  Memories of disgusting chicken fingers and mozzarella sticks (things you wouldn't think would even be possible to mess up cooking) flew through my mind.  And the second I walked in the door I got the same feeling that I needed to sanitize every surface that I dare touch.  Now let me say, there is shady good, and shady bad. This is shady horrific. It reminds me of the smell of a plastic puke bucket from when you are sick as a child.  But deep inside me, I just had to stay, socialize, and try their fried pickles. I did, and they were the best things I have eaten there. At least you could tell they were not 3 year old frozen pieces of cardboard like everything else on the menu.  But for fried pickles they still weren't the best.  The only positive thing that I can think of is the fact that our waitress did seem to handle our huge unruly space-cadet group of people quickly and with ease. If that is the only saving grace, I'd rather eat my fried pickles elsewhere.

Romantic, intimate and warm. Go on a Sunday night for the amazing flamenco performances by Calo Flamenco.  And if it's your birthday- they'll teach you to dance! I wish the price point was a bit better... but then again that's what you get for a good glass of wine.

How can you not like Four Peaks? I mean... for real. Awesome beers, delicious food (My favs are the blackened chicken nachos and salmon blt) great patio and bar, and consistently good service. Plus, get your brunch on on Sundays too! The breakfast beer bread melts in my mouth every time.

Uh, yeah- I go here all of the time for Happy Hour because I work on Mill Ave.  I have been here twice this week for HH actually. Pretty much the best HH in town as far as I am concerned.  Fridays tend to get a bit crowded, but any other day of the week I would highly suggest! $2 Drafts including Guinness, Stella and Mothership Wit to name a few, $4 off their Specialty Drinks and 1/2 off most of their delectable appetizers.  My Favs: Shrimp Adriatico and the Capriatta.  To drink: Anastasia Martini or see if they'll make you a Lotus Martini which isn't listed on the menu anymore.  The bartenders are super friendly and remember you which is a plus!

Went in for a blow out for a friend's wedding. Angie was meticulous with my hair to make sure that it look just right, I was happy about it, and it held through the evening's festivities (I have fine hair and it usually falls out quickly). She also took the time to tell me what kind of products she was putting in my hair and what they would accomplish.  I left the salon with glamorous curls that I know I could not have done on my own. I received so many compliments that evening and could not be happier, and the curls stayed all night! I paid $40 for the blow out which I thought was very reasonable given the time and care she took.

I really loved this place. Went their on Sunday night with my bf after our disappointment that Marcello's was closed. The atmosphere was cozy and quaint and I was even delighted by a surprisingly not annoying live accordian player.  I opted for the special of the evening which was a pasta duo. Homemeade gnocchi in a creamy pesto sauce and also a mushroom stuffed ravioli topped with prosciutto. The gnocchi was to die for. Melt in your mouth.  I would have loved to try their dessert but two bottles of wine later and I was just too much of a stuffed monkey.

Yes... I went to Popeye's for dinner tonight.  I had a craving for popcorn shrimp and it was the closest thing to satisfy my hunger.  Is it just me or are their portions shrinking?  My popcorn shrimp was good and finger-lickin' greasy like I expected, but I could have eaten 3 times the amount! I guess that explains why they don't have a kid's menu and my boyfriend's son couldn't get a damn toy! They have obviously melded the two menus together and now I get to pay $6.95 for a combo that is kid-sized.

Upon entering Cheeburger Cheeburger, I had high expectations.  I mean, any place that decides to name themselves after a reference in SNL's Olympia Cafe sketch should be good, right?  I went with several friends and we were hungry!  One of my friends even went as far as to order the full pound burger.  As soon as we walked in I was immediately turned off.  There were a good amount of gnats hovering amidst the whole front bar area. I figured it was from the fluorescent lighting inside and they were being attracted inside from the dark, so we chose to sit outside.  I do have to say I was impressed by the fact that I could get myself a Chocolate Coke and that it took me way to long to actually decide on what toppings I wanted on my burger.  The selection of drink flavors and burger toppings is certainly not lacking.  However, upon getting the food, I was less than impressed for a place that prides themselves to the point of putting their product in their business name.  The service was slow.  After my friend finished his full pound burger- the employees were not thrilled at all to have to take his picture with the Stuffed Cheeburger and put it up on the Wall of Fame.  I would think this would be the most exciting part of their job!  I don't think I would give it a second chance if I was craving a juicy burger again. I'd rather drive down the street and grab a delectable In-N-Out Burger Animal Style- spending less money and leaving much more satisfied.

I originally intended to hit up their happy hour, but it being a Friday night, it was too packed. Decided to get a table for dinner instead. I was hesitant because it seemed a bit on the pricey side for some of their dishes. But after tasting the food... no regrets. I had the pasta alla vodka. Our waitress said that it is their best selling dish. I can see why. Oh, and the marscapone cheesecake? OMGRN. My only qualm was how loud the dining area was. I will try to go back on weekday for happy hour.

I have witnessed many businesses rise and fall on Mill Ave. and I am hoping this one will stay.  It fills a void of needing to buy a pack of smokes, an ASU t-shirt just before game time, your lunch time 6-pack of beer or your bottle of wine on the way home to your sweetie.  And if your belly is aching you can get a gourmet dog to fill your appetite.  It's open early enough all week and stays open late enough to catch the drunken weekend crowd. w00t! Make sure to check it out.... hidden right by the Post Office. :-)

Walking distance from my house, the BEST coffee, and consistent service. They are always busy, but have their waitstaff and bus boys running a seamless operation. They can flip a table in no time. I love how they re-decorated and still smile seeing their egg carton and eggshell art. The protein pancakes are bomb and they have an ample outdoor seating area that is nice for a leisurely brunch.

I freaking love Pita Jungle. The only reason I give this a 4 is because it took a really long time for the waitress to get over to our table to even get our drink order. I can't stay away from the jalape√±o cilantro hummus. I order a side of cucumbers and tomatoes to go along with it instead of extra pitas (cause you can never eat all that hummus with the pita they give you alone). They have great freshly brewed iced teas too. Light, refreshing, and fulfilling.

If you are a beer lover, this place should be on your list to stop at.  They have a great selection for such a small establishment.  Tip: Don't just look at the beer menus they leave at the tables, new kegs that they've recently gotten in will be listed on the specials board up front, or always helpful is to just ask the bartenders.  They are friendly and give good recommendations.   They recently started doing beer flights which I personally think is great.  That way you get to sample a bit of all the best worlds.  Flights are $5 and you get four 5 oz. beer samples of your choice.  In terms of food- I say Garlic Parmesan boneless wings all the way!  Their spice is a bit on the mild side, so I always go one step above Hot but not Atomic.  And... what could be better than fried pickles?! It's always so hard to find places that have these scrumptious treats.  Theirs are spear style with a traditional bread crumb breading mixed with dill.  They always come out extra hot so I have to give them a few minutes to cool.  If you normally order ranch as a dipping sauce for you wings and things, you should really give their blue cheese dip a try. It is homemade and on the mild side.  It's the perfect creamy consistency and doesn't scream blue cheese (which is normally what keeps me away from ordering this at other restaurants).  Karaoke on Friday nights is a blast and not too crowded.

Exactly what you would expect. Soul food, biscuits & gravy, and chicken & waffles plastered on the front windows. My biscuits and gravy were good. I also had the pleasure of tasting the fried chicken that came with the chicken and waffles. Damn good fried chicken made to order. The waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. I would come back for sure.

Good place to have a beer, duck fart, or whatever you may fancy.  I am absolutely in love with their fried pickles. They are so far my favorite in the valley. Long sandwich style slices with a crispy light beer-esque batter.  They also have some wonderful perogies on the menu. If you order a burger... you must try the red cabbage slaw as a side.  I like going here to just have a low key night. Good place to watch sports too- that's just not really my scene.

I visited Meatballz several weeks ago before a night at the movies. All I can say is that the Calzone crust was obviously made out of Pillsbury's Hot Roll Mix and dry out of the box tortellini is not what I expected for nearly $9 for a small bowl. Never returning.

My favorite 3 dishes: Eggs Benedict, Biscuits and Gravy, Kielbasa scramble. I love the feel of this mom/pop cafe. The service is wonderful. I have also been to their Friday Night dinners. Love the BYOB concept and the special menus. It's nice to know who exactly is cooking your meal. The only thing I wish was that they never closed for vacation!

Like the concept. Especially since when you go to a regular theatre you end up paying a ton of money for cruddy concessions. I have bought the Groupons for it several times. Totally worth it. The staff is very good and it is a nice touch being offered a mint on your way out. 1 tip: Don't order the dragon fruit mojito. Gross. I thought a mojito had more than just 1 mint leaf floating at the top...?!? I blame it on inexperienced drink makers. I will just go to the bar afterwards.

Great dinner with good company. Shared the Dad's Grocery Bag Appetizer and had the Blackened Red Fish as my main. Washed everything down with some yummy dirty martinis. They let me sub some saut√©ed Swiss chard instead of the dirty orzo for those that are laying off the carbs. No complaints on the service. I enjoyed the cozy and quiet atmosphere.
