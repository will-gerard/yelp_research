I drove 35 minutes (from the bowels of the valley... aka Gilbert) to get to Pomeroy's and it was well worth it. I met up with a group of friends to celebrate the life and times of Michael Jackson and the jukebox was ready for us. They had $30 worth of MJ songs loaded up that lasted us most of the evening. They have a slightly elevated game room with wooden floors that are perfect for moonwalking.   They have several beers on tap, at a reasonable price. And, their menu is filled with delicious grilled cheese variations- my choice of the evening was grilled cheese with bacon. Bacon makes EVERYTHING better, right?   I would totally agree with labeling this as a "dive bar" - dim lighting, pool tables, buck hunter.... yup, it's a divebar. But had a great time! And the service was great- thanks Charlie!

I'm not a Chinese food buff by any means... heck, this was my first experience at a sit-down Chinese food place. :) We went in and were promptly greeted and shown to our booth, the service was more than attentive, cleaning plates from the table as the last bite was still in my mouth... okay, maybe that's TOO attentive. ha  We tried the crab puffs for an appetizer, and again it was my first experience with crab puffs, but it seemed like there was barely any crab inside the puff. But, what do I know... maybe that's normal? They were tasty though... especially with the sweet sauce that accompanies it. For my entree, I had the chicken and broccoli. The serving was plentiful- way more than I should have eaten in one sitting... but I managed. Hey, I was really hungry when we walked in. :)   And, as an added bonus, I did confirm the fact that Abacus Chinese Restaurant does have an actual abacus on site. It's up front by the register. Check it out!

I love this bagel shop. Aside from being insanely crowded on weekend mornings (but what bagel place isn't?), I have no complaints. Even though the line can lead right out the front door, but with the efficiency of the employees, it never takes more than 5-10 minutes to get to the front of the line, and then my food is ready before I even have my cup filled with fountain soda :)

I was so excited to go to Sweet Tomatoes- had actually been bugging my boyfriend to go with me for a few weeks. Finally, we went on a Saturday for dinner and it was insanely crowded. It took us about 15 minutes to get through the salad bar and pay, before we waited another 10 minutes (while staring at our salads) for a table to open up to sit down. So, we sat down, I enjoyed my salad, went up for some soup (ick... not again). I was still hungry, but the thought of standing in the salad line again was unbearable.   There were many good options on the salad bar, but almost everything up there, aside from the lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, etc, (think pasta salads, potato salads, veggie mixes) was coated in a thick sauce, which takes away from the "eating healthy at the salad buffet" idea.    I've learned my lesson. I'd rather get a big salad from a sit-down restaurant for the same price

This place just might be the home of the best gyro that I've ever tasted. I have weekly cravings for Niro's (which I often give in to) and I live about 20 minutes away! The service is great as it seems that the owners are always at the front register to chat with while you're waiting for your gyro.

The sandwiches are pretty good, I believe I had the Ham & Swiss on my last trip there. The food portions are bigger than I can eat and the sandwiches are nice and melty. The shop itself is small- order at the counter and they'll call out when your order is ready.  SubFactory isn't my favorite sandwich shop, and I probably wouldn't ever pick this place to eat, but I wouldnt be opposed to going if someone else wanted to.

Oh my gosh... biggest "small" sandwich ever! I ordered a small sub sandwich, which turns out is 9 inches! A small!! I was more than full when I finished... and I couldn't even put down the whole sandwich. The staff was super friendly and made our sandwiches to order. Yup, I'll be going again soon.

Since moving to Arizona, I've found an appreciation for mexican food (except for beans... I dont know why, but I just can't get into them). We went to Rosita's on a double-date- my boyfriend and the other couple used to go there a lot "back in the day" and they all love it. I guess I just don't fit into the mold.   The chips were average... the salsa too- not very spicy and a little watered down even. I ordered a combo plate, trying a beef enchilada and a chicken taco. Both were average... nothing to write home about. Equivalent to Filberto's for about 3x the cost.   The atmosphere was not my favorite... lots of families there at 8pm... with lots of screaming kids. Why did each adult couple have 7 kids with them???   My favorite part of Rositas = their huge glasses of pop. I only needed one refill of my diet coke :)

I had never had Teppan before, so my boyfriend took me to this restaurant for dinner on a weekday evening. We were seated at a table with another guy, who lived nearby and seemed to visit the place often (as gathered from his conversation with the chef). We both ordered the steak and what a great meal it was. I was in awe watching him make the fried rice... awesome.   Can't wait to go back :)

I don't know what exactly it is about the food here, but I always wind up going home with the worst upset stomach of my life. I've given it several tries, varying what I ate (so much that I didn't eat ANY of the same things during visits... not even the bread/cinnamon butter that they hand up upon arriving). So, that's why I can't rate this place very well.   Otherwise, service is always good and no other complaints

I liked this place... because it's a local owned place with delicious greasy food. This place was written up in the East Valley Trib in one of their "5 to try" pieces, which is where I first heard about it. But, I actually think it's funnier that I have been in "Hall of Fame", a store located direclty next door several times and never given Giant Hamburgers a second glance.   You walk into this place, past a grouping of tables and booths (only about 15 tables in the entire place)  to the cash register where you order your meal. We each got a burger and fries and they were both great, a real gut-bomb, but sometimes you're in the mood for something that fits just that description. We sat and ate, and they came to bus our table for us.   On the way out, we noticed the "Yelp" sticker on the door. Bonus points.

This store had a decent selection of fabric and all the same patterns available at other JoAnn stores, but I was totally unimpressed.   I signed up for a sewing class and the instructor was 15 minutes late. Then, she decided to change the project for the class so we ended up spending the first 30 minutes of the class buying new fabric and patterns (which could have taken longer, but thankfully there were only 2 of us enrolled in this class). The projects ended up turning out well, but it was a disappointing experience as the class was stopped promptly at the end time and I feel like I didn't get my ful allotted time.   The store is in a strip mall of not-so-great stores, so with that taken into account, the inside of the store looks fairly well maintained. The day I was there, there were 2 teenage boys working in the store who were unable to answer my questions which is less than ideal, but I guess if that's all you can get to work in the store...   *sigh* I'll stay in my corner of the valley to shop for fabrics. If this is your corner of the valley, head South to the SanTan location - it's great.

Was referred to this location for an MRI (was having foot pain). My appointment time was at 8am and they told me to arrive 30 minutes early to fill out paperwork, so I did. Upon arrival, they gave me a one-page health survey to fill out, which I did and within 10 minutes they had called me back to the testing area.   They had me put my purse into a locked locker (of which I held the key for), and took me into the MRI suite. They had me lay down on the table, and even gave me a blanket as it was a little chilly in the room. The MRI took about 15 minutes to complete and I was out of the office by 8:05am (just 5 minutes after my scheduled appointment time). Perfect.   The employees were fabulous and I have zero complaints. Hope I dont have to go back for more testing, but if I do, I'll gladly go to this location.

I've been seeing Dr Wyant at East Valley Foot & Ankle for about 4 years because I've had some foot issues since I was little. I've always been able to get an appointment within a few days and the office staff have been really nice & helpful (even when trying to help me get the referral faxed from my PCP, whose office staff isn't as great).   I love that they have xray equipment on site and it's been really quick getting into a MRI at EVDI when I've needed one.

Met up with a couple friends for a double date at this Ahwatukee pizza place. They frequent this joint fairly often, so I knew it had to be good. We ordered the caprese salad, and a made-to-order pizza. Both were delicious and worth eating again. The wait staff were very friendly and we actually sat and had a drink with one of the managers before we left at the end of the night.   The only thing that prevented me from giving this place 5 stars was the price- a little more than I would generally feel comfortable paying for a pizza. But, it was so good that I'd go back.

I went to Jason's Deli on a recommendation from friends, knowing that I'm a soup/salad/sandwich-type food lover. But, I'd say that I'm pretty picky about which places I like, because if you're going to get me to pay $7 for a sandwich, it better be darn good.   Jason's Deli was good. I'd definitely go again. I had a half ham & swiss on french bread and a cup of their cheddar broccoli soup. Yummy. They also have a huge salad bar that I'd like to try out on my next visit.   Downside- all sandwiches come with a handful of potato chips. Wondering if they have any alternative for those of us not a fan of greasy chips? Will find out on the next trip  PS, outdoor seating, FTW

I went to The Good Egg on a first date (yeah, a little strange, I know), but it was a great choice.  The service was egg-celent (okay, a little cheesy). Our waitress was very patient as it took us awhile to decide what we were eating between conversation and then wasn't in a rush to get rid of us after we finished eating.   The food was good- I had a Belgium waffle and hash browns; both extremely delicious. I'm going to add this place to my list of places I'm looking forward to heading back to.

I usually love places with a 50's diner atmosphere and walking into this place, it was no exception - it's cute. The jukebox, booths, decor, etc, etc make this a fun-looking place. The food (I had a burger) was okay, but nothing special. On another occasion, I went in with the sole purpose of getting a chocolate malt to go for my boyfriend and it was over $6 for just a malt. That was the point when I realized I would never be back to 5 & Diner. I think that's outrageous and hell, they're almost robbing you.

Went to this location for lunch last month (May 2013) and the service sucked... like beyond sucked. I had to wait at the door to be greeted... then was taken to a table. I literally sat there for 10 minutes before ANYONE came to the table to greet me or ask if I would like a beverage. And, to top it off, it was the hostess who came over because she noticed that no one had come over to me yet.   She got my iced tea, and I saw her to over to a group of 3 waiters/waitresses who were standing in a group talking (I assume to tell someone that I was waiting). It took another 5 minutes before anyone came over. We were picking up our purses to leave when the waiter finally came over. He never apologized for the wait.   I can't complain about the food. I got a sandwich and it was good... but the food at CPK is not my issue.   I won't go back to this location... poor service (without apology) is a total restaurant turn-off for me.

I've been to Teakwoods a couple different times and have enjoyed myself each and every time. My last visit was one of the most memorable. We were there in large group and they ran out of the larger draft glasses on the last 2 of us (me and my boyfriend). So, they brought us each out a mini-pitcher full of beer and charged us for the glass. Amazing!   The service is great- quick and friendly and with peanuts on the table, you can't go wrong. Inside, it's your standard local bar (with peanut shells all over the floor). And, on the outside, it's tucked inside a strip mall with ample parking.

This place looks daunting from the street... run down and attached to what I think is a convenience store. The place looks just the same on the inside. You walk to the back of the place and order from a window and they call out numbers when the food is ready. They have a self-serve soda machine, which is a bonus because I'm a sucker for refills (but hate asking for them).   We took our food to the tables outside (we cleaned one off ourselves) and had a nice chat in the AZ sunshine. The food was good, I just had a taco and a side of rice (we had just eaten a full meal a few hours prior) but they were delicious. Hoping to get back again soon!

Wow... what a surprise Liberty Market is. I'd lived in the east valley for about 3 years before ever setting foot in Liberty Market. It honestly doesn't look much different from the outside than all of the other places I've never set foot in inside downtown Gilbert (although that's probably MY problem, not theirs). But, with help from a lot of friends who swear by Liberty Market (and seeing them be so interactive on social media sites, like twitter), I have now been there multiple times. Their food is amazing, I have yet to be disappointed by anything they have served.   Ice Cream Cookie Sandwich, FTW :)

I've been going to Judy's for a little over a year and I have never had a single complaint. Each of their "waxing gals" are amazing, and make the experience as easy as can be. The receptionist is very friendly and makes every effort to schedule your appointment around YOUR schedule- they are extremely accommodating.

We went here for lunch one day and after hearing so many good things, I was shocked that I didn't have a great experience. We walked in and there was no one at the hostess station, but there was (someone who appeared to be) a manager playing with one of the televisions who chose not to greet us. So, we waited for a few minutes before someone showed us to a table, where we waited another 5-10 minutes before we were greeted by our waiter (who, to his credit, was swamped with tables). I can understand being busy, but the fact that there were two "managers" walking around, and not helping customers was what bugged me.   We didn't try the wings, but I had a meatball sandwich, which was pretty good, but not good enough to entice me back for a second trip. Ooooor, maybe the NewYorkers sensed that we were both from CHI-TOWN and chose not to take care of us :) haha

I used Bryant Pest Control after moving into a new house. The guy who came out to do the service spent about 20 minutes spraying the inside and outside of the house, even taking time to show me the "hot spots" where the cockroaches were hiding out and the different varieties of cockroaches taking residence in my house/yard (ick... but cool to get the knowledge). I signed the paper saying that the service was complete and the guy left. No issues whatsoever with the actual service performed.   Later that evening, I got 6 text messages from the guy who sprayed my house (must have gotten the number off the service order because I sure as heck did not give it to him). He was saying some very inappropriate things about me and his "desires." I text back saying that I had a boyfriend. He then, sent me 5 more text messages that were equally, if not more, inappropriate as the first set of texts.   The next workday, I called in to the office and spoke with one of the owners, letting her know what happened and my concerns. She stated that she had "known him for years and couldn't imagine him doing something like this." I felt like my concerns were blown off over the phone, and never received a follow-up letter or phone call, which I believe would have been good customer service, especially in this situation. I have since been receiving calls about once a week to schedule another appointment despite me asking them to stop calling.   I now am using another company for my pest control needs.

The first time I went to this Jiffy Lube, there were 2 cars in the 2 bays that were being worked on. I ended up waiting almost 2 hours for an oil change. I can understand them being busy, so it's not the wait time that upsets me, it's the fact that the techs couldn't be straight with me and just let me know up front- I would have been more than happy to go run an errand and then come back by the shop. And, after an hour of waiting, I asked them what the ETA was, and they said my car would go in "any minute" and would only take about 10-15 minutes... lie. It was another hour.   I needed another oil change this morning, and decided to give this place another try (thinking that maybe it was just a bad crew that day), and it was the same story. I went in at 07:40 because they opened at 0730 and I figured it would be quick to go in early before a line of people built up. I arrived and there were 2 techs there and a mini-van already in the bay. When I went in to drop of my keys, he told me it would be about 45 minutes until he was able to get to my car. I must have had a surprised look on my face, because he quickly responded with "because there's only 2 of us here". I said "okay" and sat down; one of them was working on the van while the other was reading a magazine behind the counter. Seriously?!??!?!   Never again will I go to this Jiffy Lube. I posted a comment on my facebook about waiting forever at this Jiffy Lube and I received multiple comments from people saying that they've had problems at this same location. Good news: I'm not alone. Bad news: Corporate hasn't fixed the problem that many people are having.

Honestly didn't have the highest hopes for a hotel in Wickenburg, but was pleasantly surprised. Each room has it's own outdoor entrance with parking in a central private lot.   The rooms were clean and spacious. They had a fridge in each room which is always a bonus in my eyes.   I'd stay here again if I needed a room in Wickenburg for sure.

I love hole in the wall finds. I can't take credit for this find as my boyfriend took me here one afternoon for lunch. But, I think he knows that I'm a sucker for outdoor dining. Plus, it was gorgeously sunny outside. We both ordered some grub... I think I had a chicken burrito on my first visit.   This place is cash only, which is a huge pain in the butt these days. They do have an ATM in house, but it charges you a couple bucks to take out your cash.

My car battery died & the dealer sent Customer One Towing to me (it was under warranty if I had the dealer test it and change it out). They sent me a text message to let me know they were on the way and confirm the address and then were here 10 minutes before their promised time. The driver was great, took great care in loading my car onto the flatbed, and got my car to the dealer safely.   I put them in my contacts on my phone in case I ever need another tow!

Sorry to disagree with all the gangplank boys, but.... well.... I strongly disagree. Chuck and I stopped at Coffee Island on our way to Gangplank this afternoon and I really wish I would have just spent 3 minutes making sandwiches at home and saved us the $13.   I had the Ham & Swiss, Chuck had the Southwest Sandwich, and I could have EASILY made the same sandwiches at home for a fraction of the cost. . The sandwiches were good, but not amazing. Our beverages were 2 cans of pop- Diet Coke and Dr Pepper. Whoa!... Turns out those are both found in my refrigerator as well! And, had to pick a chunk of mold off of my bread  Next time, I'll definitely choose cooking myself over throwing money down the drain at Coffee Island.   Although, on the upside, the 2 people working there were extremely nice, bringing out extra dill pickles, and stirring up some conversation (in the 10 minutes it took to make a frickin' sandwich).

I can't say I'm a fan of the Scotsdale scene, which is why I was excited to go to Giligan's for a friend's birthday- I had heard that it was a dive bar right in Old Town. Sweet, right?? Nope, not so much.  We got there around 7pm- it was still relatively quiet; many in the group ordered food, which were all giant platters of deep fried seafood on a mount of french fries. About 10 minutes into eating, a group of 15 or so kids showed up and started playing flippy cup at the back tables, and it got loud enough that I could barely hear the person next to me talking (one of the things I dislike about the Scotsdale club scene). Then, around 8 or 8:30, the place started getting more crowded, the volume on the jukebox was turned up, and the place got trashy. It was a total sausage-fest (not an issue for me, but hard to hook up the guy friends when there's no chicks in the place). The "little people", or whatever the PC term is, were overly creepy- grabbing my ass as they walked by. Ewww.

This was my first experience at this particular Ra. I left the restaurant thinking about how horrible the service was, but giving it the usual "but maybe it was just a bad night there". But, from reading the other reviews, I'd have to say it's a bad night there every night.   We went on a Friday night at 6pm, so I expected it to be busy... but it actually wasn't too bad. There were about 5 empty tables indoors, and we sat at one of the 3 empty tables on the back patio. It took the server about 15 minutes to acknowledge our existence, and only after we went to the bartender to ask for drinks. I have to give the guy credit though, he was pleasant the whole time.   As we were getting to the end of our meal, the patio was getting more and more crowded, which means that there were more and more people standing (very close to our table, which makes me a little uncomfortable).   We had saki bombers, edemame, shrimp tempura, and california rolls. The edemame was good- my first attempt at this appetizer. California rolls, which are usually my favorite, were rolled very loosely which made each one fall apart when picked up with the chop sticks. Bummer.

A place with over 110 reviews and ZERO one or two star reviews has to be pretty great, right? Right. I've been to this place several times and have yet to have a bad experience. I love the environment- big patio and even the indoor area (to the right when you walk in) is open air yet in the walls of the brewery.   My favorite beer= the hef My favorite food= beer bread sandwiches   Biggest negatives: how crowded this place often gets & their awkward location/poor parking availability. But, it's crowded because it's good, right?

I wandered into this store while wandering down Mill on a Saturday afternoon and what a pleasant surprise it was. Their design fit perfectly with my tastes and I wish I had the extra cash to redesign my house with their products.   The salespeople were friendly and helpful, but not pushy. Great experience!

Man, I love this place!! It's the perfect place to go for a night out. The comedians are amazing- I can't say that I've seen a bad one in the dozens of times i've been and who doesn't love to laugh?? The food is a touch overpriced for Tempe, but it's nice to sit and chat for awhile with an appetizer before the comedians come on stage.   My favorite place to sit for a date/2 person party: in the back of the showroom at the high-top tables. Then you can  have some private conversation - at the tables on the floor, they seat in 4s, so if you go with a date, you will end up sitting with 2 other people- can be good for conversation, but that depends on the people you're next to.

Being in this bar makes me feel dirty. There are always the creepiest of the creepy guys inside and the girls that look like their fake IDs weren't good enough to get them into a good bar on Mill. The music is always insanely loud (and not even good, usually).   Highlight: the outdoor patio. I'm a sucker for outdoor dining/drinking

This might be my favorite place in the state of Arizona! Who needs the Grand Canyon or Sedona when you have HoHoKam Stadium?? (okay, maybe a little bit of exaggeration there..haha). I love the Cubbies, baseball, sunshine, cold beer, and hot dogs. I honestly think that HoHoKam is the best spring training stadium in AZ (and I've been to them all)- mostly because of the atmosphere. This place is the only park I've seen that has ACTUAL tailgaters, complete with bags (somewhat like horseshoes, for those not from Chicago), coolers, and radios blasting.   I can't wait for March! I've got my tickets! :)

Rosati's has the best thin crust pizza that I have yet to find in Arizona (and being from Chicago, I have high standards). This location is delivery/carry out only and can make a pie in about 20 minutes from the time you order it (plenty of time to wander around one of the stores in the strip mall it's located in).   The service was good- the phone was answered within a few rings to place our order and we were greeted immediately upon entering the location. If you look a good thin crust pizza, this is the place to try. Oh, and their sausage is pretty great too :)

As far as budget hotels go, this place is a big winner. Traveling with a pet often makes it difficult to find a nice hotel, but this La Quinta makes it easy.  The rooms are spacious and include a small kitchen (microwave, fridge, freezer, stove, and pots/pans/dishes). Our room was a good size, plenty of space for the 2 of us plus a pooch. The room was clean and the bed was relatively comfortable; my only complaint is with the pillows (they were down and the feathers were poking through the pillow...and they were pretty flat). Next time, I'll bring my own with me.   They have a free continental breakfast which was pretty good. Waffles, biscuits and gravy, fruit, oatmeal, yogurt, cereal, etc. The front desk staff were very helpful.   I'll plan on staying here again next time I'm in town with my dog.

As a true baseball fan, I can really say that this stadium is awful. Baseball is about baseball... it's not about big plasma TVs, chain restaurants (Peter Piper Pizza, Coldstone, Panda Express, etc, etc), and signs that tell you when you need to cheer for your team. A real stadium is full of fans that are actually watching the game and not reading a newspaper or sitting in the "knitting" section during the special game that gives participants a bag of knitting supplies.   Everything at this ballpark is about endorsements, vendors, gift shop sales, and manufacturing the most about of revenue for the least coin. I still go to games for the love of baseball, but since living in AZ, I've come to enjoy real baseball during spring training 100x more than the actual baseball season.

I've been to a few different Margaritavilles around the country and this one is by far my favorite (some of the others are actually rather mediocre). It's always busy (AKA festive) and a great time. My favorite place to sit is up on the 3rd floor balcony overlooking the strip. As far as the food goes,  I'd recommend the nachos and the "cheeseburger in paradise." Food that I wouldn't quite recommend: Ahi tuna, crab/lobster dip (it was mostly cheese).   As expected, the margaritas are fantastic- just take a peak at the first page inside the menu and you can see all their signature creations. Mmmmm.

We went to Carnegie Deli on a Monday morning (around 10:30am) for breakfast. The service was extremely slow considering the place wasn't even full. Although, once our orders were taken the food was brought out quickly (although I had to sit and wait for her to bring syrup for the french toast). My boyfriend got an omlete sandwich, which he loved. Just about everything on the breakfast menu included eggs, which isn't so good for a girl whose #1 biggest dislike is eggs. The french toast, which was delcious by the way, was the ONLY breakfast entree without eggs involved. So, good thing I like french toast.   I probably would have given this a better review under one of the two following conditions: a) the service wasn't terrible (she even cut me off mid-sentance when I was ordering) b) I liked eggs and/or they had more than eggs on the breakfast menu  I've had the cheesecake from the Carnegie in New York and if they use the same receipe in Vegas, it has to be amazing. Wish I had left room in my belly to get a piece.

Waited 20 minutes for a burger...on a Tuesday at 3pm...no one in line. Enough said.

I think the food is delicious, especially the meatballs. Nom. The last time I was there, I was in the mood for something lighter so I opted for the buffalo chicken wrap. The wrap was good, but surprisingly hot... like hotter than "hot" wings at most restaurants. I actually had to stop eating because my mouth was on fire despite downing multiple classes of whatever beverage I was drinking.   When it's busy, the cafeteria can get pretty unkept... seems like they don't have enough staff to keep up with the cleaning a lot of the time. But, when I go on a weekday when there aren't 50 million people at IKEA, everything looks great

You walk into Joe's Real BBQ, get into line and grab a tray. The menu is gigantic upon the wall and you can pick your main dish selection. On my last trip, I had the pulled pork sandwich. Then, as you slide your tray on the counter, you pick your sides (you get two with each "meal" selection). I had their mac n' cheese... nom... and the corn... also delicious. And, of course you pay for your meal - I don't remember what my bill came out to, but I know it wasn't outrageous.   Then, you have your food and you can go sit down at a table. They have a large eating space with tables and booths and even outdoor seating. The atmosphere is very casual and a great place to eat some BBQ.   If you're not in the mood to sit and dine at the restaurant, they have an outdoor window located on the South side of the building where you can place your order, wait a few minutes and get your food to go.

I love good Italian food - but last night just didn't make the list of "places with good Italian food". We had a group of 9 and Harleys was very accommodating with a large enough table, and the service was excellent. We started with one of the specials - bruschetta with goat cheese. The bread had extremely large chunks of goat cheese covering it, which might be good if you didn't want to taste the bread or seasonings, but turns out... I like tasting the bread and seasonings too. So, even after taking half the goat cheese off, I found that the bread was saturated with balsamic vinaigrette - very soggy.   The timing was also off in bringing out our food. As the waiter set down the appetizer, he said "oh, and your pizza is ready. I'll bring that out too", keeping in mind that no one else at our table of 9 had received their meals yet and we hadn't even taken a bite of the appetizer.   So, the pizza comes out and it looks like what my hospital cafeteria makes... and it tastes identical. Although, it may have been even greasier than the hospital cafeteria pizza. We brought home the leftovers, but I doubt they'll even get eaten.  Sorry Harley's... the service was great, but the food was not. Hoping I was there on a night when a substitute chef was in the kitchen since most of the other reviews are so positive.

This is the best off-the-strip hotel in Vegas, hands down. I've stayed here several times now as it is about a mile and a half away from my grandparents' home. Their rooms are fabulous (at an acceptable price). Their beds are so comfortable and the bathrooms are luxurious, including marble counter tops and showers. But, it's really the little things that draw me in to the rooms, from the multiple options at lighting- bedside spotlights for reading, overhead recessed lighting over the bed, office lamp above the desk, ambient lighting in the bathroom, to a light-up makeup mirror in the bathroom. The comforter is great (I wish I had an identical one at my house); it's light enough that it doesn't overhead you, but heavy enough that it keeps you warm in the air conditioned room.   There is a ton to do at the resort, from family friendly options like the movie theater or bowling alley, to foodie options in their several restaurants, to gambling, and of course the spa with a huge list of services.

I can safely say that Oreganos has the best stuffed pizza in the state of Arizona. It takes about 45 minutes to bake, so on top of the general 20-60 minute wait for a table... just make sure you come on a night you have plenty of time and are in the mood for a good time. While you wait, there is a full bar with staff that will be happy to greet you and offer a drink.   The location isn't huge, almost 40% of the seating is available on their patio (along with a second, much smaller, outdoor bar).

My best friend swore by this place after she went the last few weekends, so we decided to hit it up on a "girls Sunday morning out". We went just after 11am (when they opened)- she ordered off their breakfast menu and had a tasty breakfast burrito, with a side of hash browns and a bloody mary while I decided to just go for lunch and get a meatball sub with a side of tots. Mmmmmm. Food was delicious. The staff was great as well, every single person working there said hi to us at some point in the hour and a half we were there.   The bar itself has the "hole in the wall" feel to it, which I love. Nothing too fancy- neon signs, arcade games, and an outdoor patio. They have the handheld trivia games and flatscreen TVs inside the bar as well as on the patio.

Since my last review, I've been to this place several (maybe 20) more times. They have live music (with no cover) on Thursdays-Sundays, which has proven, without fail, to be very entertaining.   They also have free wifi so you can bring your laptop and get some work done while you eat. The place is generally very quiet on weekdays during lunch, so it's convenient to sit in a booth and actually get some work done.   Really can't think of a negative thing to say about CKs. Actually chose this as a venue to throw my boyfriend's birthday party on a Saturday night. Can't wait!

This park is amazing! I just recently moved from Mesa to Gilbert and boy...what a breath of fresh air to see the town put so much time into community.   I was recently studying for a big test for work and I would come to this park during the daytime to sit outside and read. They have picnic benches all over the place and while school is in session, it was pretty quick on a weekday afternoon. Plus, its absolutely gorgous. Seems like it would be a great place for a family-oriented afternoon.

I went to this spa with my boyfriend for a pair of massages and it was actually my first time getting a professional massage. I had called the spa just a week before and was easily able to find an appointment slot to accommodate the two of us at the same time. When we got to the spa that afternoon, we were pleasantly greeted at the door and they took our names. We then had a few page questionnaire to fill out about what types of things were preferred in a massage (i.e. like having your head or feet rubbed, or music you preferred to be playing).   They are reasonably priced (seems to be pretty equal with the large massage chain in the valley) and the staff were wonderful. If I were to get another massage, I would definitely go back to Fuschia.

Cosmo is one of the best dog parks that I've ever been to. It has everything that your doggie could possibly want: a lake for swimming/fetching, lots of room for running, a fenced in area for the dogs who don't do as well off the leash, a fire hydrant to drink from (too cute), and a separate area for shy/timid dogs.   Right behind the dog park is the walking trail that runs alongside the 202. So, even if you have to drive to get to the dog park, you can still take Fido for a long walk (good for drying off after a dip in the lake).

The last 2 times, I have taken my pooch to Cosmo, she has come home sick. The first time, she got a rash all over her neck (even after being washed down at home afterwards). This last time we went (about 2 weeks ago) she started throwing up in the lake. Then, I noticed a small dog (possibly a Jack Russell mix was doing the same thing) and then my friend's dog (a lab mix) was throwing up as well. Time to leave, right? I took my dog home and gave her a bath (but the same rash still returned on her neck).   A few hours later, I get a call from my friend. She had to take her dog to the vet emergently because she wouldn't drink any water, could barely get up, and was breathing very heavily after being sick at the park. The vet said that it appears to be some sort of virus that she probably caught in the water. The dog was rehydrated and given some antibiotics and perked up within a few days, but still... that's scary. We will no longer be going to this dog park. It's worth the drive to Tempe's dog parks to keep my dog safe and healthy.

We go to this PetSmart on a regular basis... probably a few times a month for all of our dog and fish necessities. The employees are always very helpful - one of the employees even stopped to help me pick out a properly sized "Gentle Leader" and showed me how to put it on my dog.   I love that this PetSmart does adoptions with the local rescues on Saturdays. Stop by if you want to see some cute dogs and cats :)

I've heard people say that Disneyland is the happiest place on the planet... I might have to disagree (although I've never been. haha). I LOVE Home Depot. Love it!   I bought a house last year and this store was my go-to-place for everything and the staff could not have been more helpful. They walked me through doing projects I had never done before, from putting up a misting system on my back patio to replacing the insides of a toilet tank, to installing a ceiling fan.   Chris, the master plumber even went out of his way to give me his hours at the store so I could call if I had any questions while I was working on my plumbing projects.   Also, I purchased carpet (with installation services) from Home Depot and had a great experience. They kept me up to speed on my order's status and the carpet was amazing quality at a much lower price than the other carpet places I checked out before I purchased. Very impressed.

I love this place- what an amazing job the owner has done with the concept and hiring of the staff. Each of the staff members that I have met are amazing, remembering my dog's name when we come into the office.   During day care, the dogs run free in their large fenced yard from 7-11:30am, they have nap time indoors from 11:30-1:30 and then have more playtime from 1:30-6. When outdoors, they have employees with them at all times, have pools set up on hot days, and have plenty of toys.   Before each dog attends they have an introduction day, where the dog is put in the yard and the other dogs are let outside one by one to assure no aggression from the new dogs. I love this concept because it's issues like that (along with the presence of irresponsible dog owners) that can sometimes make public dog parks unsafe.

The Tavern is one of the few places on Mill that's just as good during the day as it is at night. During the day, they have some good grub- I've enjoyed eating lunch there many times (grilled chicken sandwich... nom nom). The service is great and the managers have even come over to the table to say hi.   At night (or before an ASU football game), The Tavern is a great place to party. They have patios so you can be outside and the tunes are playing which usually gets a nice group going on the dance floor.

Went in looking for a specific item and asked the employee on duty for her opinion - all she could say was that the more expensive ones were "better". I then walked to Target next door and found the same item for much less $$. Fail.

I went to this dentist without any patient referral because I needed to get in quick and they accepted my insurance. Well, they got me in the very next day, but it was one of the worse experiences that I've had at a dentist's office.   The dentist (I cannot remember his name), came in and introduced himself. I informed him that I had sensitive gums and had problems in the past with the ultrasonic cleaner being very painful. He said "okay" and started working. It seemed as though he was working very quickly and every time the ultrasonic thing touched my gums I would jump and tense up. After a few minutes he took a break and asked me how I was doing. I told him that it was hurting very bad and his exact response "Suck it up. You'll be fine." Wow. That's all I can say about that.   Needless to say, I didn't go back to this office. And, it wasn't my problem that it was hurting so bad. My new dentist uses the ultrasonic cleaner every visit and I have very little discomfort. I guess it doesn't have to hurt if you're a caring & compassionate dentist.

I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this place yet! After trying another vet in the east valley (to remain unnamed), I was on a mission to find one that I (as well as my pooch) loved. In comes Dr Sherry Johns- she is amazing. She sat on the floor with me and my dog and talked us through some of the issues we had been having. She layed out the possible treatments based on being conservative (and saving some $$) or going full out and spending full $$ to diagnose and treat. She didn't push me into the more expensive option.   The staff have all been really great as well. They seem to really love the animals that come in. I wouldn't take my pup anywhere else.

DSW has amazing, name brand shoes at a fraction of the price of the department stores across the street in San Tan Mall. How can you go wrong??   If you're looking for a specific type of shoe, DSW can be hit-or-miss as their selection changes weekly (or so it seems). I highly recommend giving it a shot though, I've had some great success. :)

I tried this place about a month ago, and have been back at least 4 times since. So glad to finally find a Chinese food place near my house that I love. When I call in an order for pick-up, the food is ready within 10 minutes and reasonably priced.   I've never eaten inside the restaurant myself, but it seems nice. There are always a couple waitresses busy keeping the customers happy. It's a small interior, with about 10 booths and 6 tables (which could be pushed together to accommodate a larger group).   Great wall is in the small strip-mall just South of Walgreens (which is at Williams Field Rd). Also in the strip-mall is Sherwin Williams and Little Caesers

I've been wanting to try Wildflower Bread Company for awhile now, but since there's not one near my house, it's just never happened. But, I'm impressed - it's delicious!   You walk up to the counter and place your order... sandwiches, soups, and pastries. I had a half sandwich and soup and it was great. The cheddar broccoli soup and big chunks of broccoli in it... a welcome change from many other chains' soups.   The employees were exceptionally cheerful and quick to get customers' orders together. My only complaint is there there isn't one closer to my house!

I loves me a good Chipotle burrito! Steak, chicken, you name it! This location is relatively new and is comparable to any other Chipotle in their food quality (just as a chains are supposed to be, right?) and interior style. One especially nice thing about this location is that it's in a small strip mall (with a Starbucks, Coldstone, Ono Hawaiian Grill, Subway, Panda Express), so in case you're with someone who might not love the Chipotle as much as I do, they can find somewhere to grab food and you can eat outdoors on the patio. :)

I come to this location for all my mailing needs and I'm never disappointed. It seems to be a family that owns Postal Connections and everyone there has been extremely nice and helpful - always try to give me options for mailing items and recommendations based on their experience and how much I'm willing to pay.   They have just about any shipping supplies you need; envelopes, padded envelopes, boxes, bubble wrap, tape, etc. They also have copying services, faxing services, and PO Boxes on site.

I'm probably a little biased in this review because of the fact that I can't stand disorganized stores. There are about 5 long aisles of merchandise in the store and it is almost completely random of what you will find (and where you will find it). From my understanding, unknown items come in each week with very good deals. The catch is that you have to be willing to maneuver your way through the mess to get to them... almost like a second-hand store. Not my thing.   I'm willing to pay a few more dollars for an item to go into a store and find it located neatly in its place; a place that I know where it is; a place that I know I will find it. (i.e. you need sheets? You know that you can go to target and they're going to have a good selection of brands, styles, and colors... and you know what section of the store you'll find them in... and they're sorted on the shelves in an order that you can quickly find the size you need).

I saw this place featured on the Food Network about a year or so ago and never beforehand that it was right in my neighborhood. What a pleasant surprise! This place has a small indoor seating area with many outdoor tables (with misters in the summertime). You walk right in to this old farmhouse, order at the counter, and take your pager to your table as they freshly cook each item your group orders. They are co-owned with Joe's Real BBQ (in downtown Gilbert), which means their BBQ menu is beyond amazing- the pulled pork was to die for :)  Just to the west of the restaurant is a small coffee shop, which makes this an ideal date destination... post dinner coffee gives you plenty of time to chat.

Sun Devil Stadium is the first "big" college football stadium I had ever been to, so keep that in mind through my review - I dont have an equal playing field (excuse the pun) to compare to.   Likes: Great fan base at each game- love to see the crowd decked out in gold Tailgating- seriously, how fun is this? :)  Location-in the middle of Mill Ave area; lots to do before/after game  Dislikes: No beer - silly college games :)  Bleacher seating- I like a good backrest & armrest  I've had a really good time going to games last season, which prompted me to be a season ticket holder this season. Go Devils :)

I was dumbfounded when I walked into this "grocery store". It's not just a grocery store at all. When you walk in and go all the way to the right side of the store you'll find a sandwich area, who make made-to-order sandwiches on a delicious baked-in-store bread in just a few minutes. Then, keep walking back and you'll find the wine and beer bar- complete with $1.99 wine samples if there's a new variety you'd like to try. Also, to my boyfriend's extreme pleasure they have a sushi chef in house who made him some killer volcano rolls.   I walked around the place checking out the goods and ended up finding a few must have items that I had to get on my way out- such as a piece of carrot cake from their all-organic bakery. Boy, was it rich and delicious :) Can't wait to head back and try some more of their selection

This is only the second dog park I've ever taken my dog to (the other was Cosmo Dog Park in Gilbert) and I liked it much better. I took the risk of going at noon on a Saturday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised. There were about 20 dogs in the park, but because the area is so big, it didn't seem too crowded. The dog has very little "dog mess" around, which shows me that people take pride in the park and generally clean up after their dogs.   My only complaint is that I saw so many owners with food, which has a tendancy to cause issues with some dogs. Owners were giving dog treats to dogs (a big no no) and there were a couple young kids walking around with ice cream bars with dogs following them (just asking for a dog to knock over your kid to get the yummy treat). All in all, I'm a big fan. I guess you'll see stupid people at every dog park, right?

My recommendation: pizza cheesesteak with mozzarella. Oh man, too delicious. (it's pizza sauce added to a traditional cheesesteak sandwich). The staff there are always super friendly and will chat about their cheesesteaks as long as you let them :)   It's a small place- maybe 15-18 tables- where you order at the counter and they call your number when the order is ready.

I went to Heart Attack Grill after seeing it in the national nursing media headlines (they were putting this place down for creating a demeaning/sexualized view of nurses). So, of course, I had to go and see what the fuss was about.   I walked in to the very small location, to find only 2 other tables with customers (older, unhygienic, obese men). The two waitresses on staff were less than appealing (and I'm the kind of girl that can look at an attractive woman and admit it) and the "cook" behind the counter, in the scrubs/doctor uniform looked like his clothes and hair hadn't been washed in more than a week.   Went ahead and ordered anyways. Their menu consists of 4 burgers (single, double, tripple, or quadruple bypass bugers), flatliner fries, and soda... but no diet soda. Oh, you can also order a pack of Camel filterless cigarettes if your stash is running low. I ordered a single bypass burger, flatliner fries, and a coke. The burger was sub-par... very greasy and the fries were soggy and half cooked. The only positive thing I have to say is that I enjoyed drinking a Coke out of a cold glass bottle.   I'd rather go to Hooters to see hot, half-dressed chicks... and I'd rather go ummmmm... ANYWHERE else to eat.

"Welcome to Firehouse!!" That's the greeting you get from the entire staff when you walk in the door (and if you go with my boyfriend, he yells that greeting along with the staff every time ANYONE walks into the place as well). We walked up the register and the staff were wonderful - helpful regarding the menu. The food came out quick, and we could tell it was fresh. I ordered the meatball and it was amazing!   I wish there was one further east (closer to my house), but anytime I'm looking for somewhere to eat in the Chandler area, Firehouse Subs will be on my mind.

This is a great choice for dinner on Mill. The atmosphere is casual, but a nice casual - definitely a nicer place than some of the other "college inspired" places on Mill. We shared a plate of brushetta and a pizza and both were great. They have a great selection of wine as well.   The service was great - very attentive and helpful.   Went to LaBocca in December (sorry, a bit behind on my reviews).

We went for a triple date night and it was a great choice. Their happy hour was fantastic (items are noted on the menu which have special, half off, happy hour prices). We stated with a round of saki bombers and edemame - delicious.   I had the california rolls and macadamia crusted chicken - both were delicious. My boyfriend got 3 plates of rolls and an appetizer... what a champ (picture uploaded).   Excited to go back and try it again.

I hate giving bad reviews to locally owned businesses... but like Abe Lincoln, I too cannot tell a lie. I love me some BBQ and had high hopes when I found this small shop in my neighborhood. I walked in on a weekday afternoon and there was only one other couple sitting down to eat. No staff were to be found- we had to wait more than just a few minutes to be greeted and sat at a table. After sitting down, it was another few minutes until our drink orders were taken, although after they had arrived, I did enjoy the mason jars full of pop.   After about 20 minutes, our food was brought out... mine about 5 minutes before my lunch date, so mine was cold by the time theirs arrived (because I'm polite like that and didn't want to eat before my friend).   The food was good, but not awesome enough to make up for the poor service. And, after reading a couple other reviews saying the same thing, I'm willing to bet it wasn't just the one day I was in there.   Will I be back? Probably not. I have several other BBQ places in the valley that I have enjoyed the overall experience far more.

I'm a sucker for baked goods, and krispy kreme definitely falls in that category. While one glorious donut has somewhere along the lines of 3,000 calories and 49 grams of fat (exaggerating, I know), it goes down like a slice of heaven. Also, on the plus side, the employees are amazing. I stopped in one morning on my way to work (dressed in my scrubs) and the employee gave me two free dozens to take to the hospital becuase it was nearby and said thanks for all we do. She had me at hello...

I found Paradise Carpet Cleaning on Yelp (and did receive the 10% Yelp discount). George is the owner/operator and the only person you deal with when calling as well as in your home, which I find as a plus. I called him last week and he was pretty flexible with his hours and able to get me in within a few days.   He called when he was on his way and was right on time. We walked through the house and talked about a few of the stains on the carpet and his strategy to get them out. He did 2 of my larger room in the home in about an hour and his rates were very reasonable.   He was professional and courteous, but also very personable. My carpets look great and I will definitely plan on using Paradise Carpet Cleaning again.

George came out to clean my carpets for the second time and was fantastic yet again. Aside from my carpets looking fabulous, which was a given, he went absolutely above and beyond his responsibilities. First, he cleaned an area in my entryway (that wasn't a part of the area he was cleaning) because "he'd feel better getting rid of the stain when he left". Who does that? A good businessman, that's who.   Also, after he was wrapped all of the hoses back in his truck, he took the time to clean up the rocks from my front yard that got knocked into my driveway. Again, above and beyond...  Sounds like simple things, but to me, they were huge.   I'd recommend George to anyone who needs carpet or tile cleaning services!

Starting with the most important factor at the Cheesecake Factory, their cheesecake is amazing. When you're reading the list of choices, some of them sound not-so-appealing, but I went out on a limb and had the Carrot Cake Cheesecake... ah-maze-ing.  The service at this location is great; very attentive. Their serving sizes are very big, allowing you to eat half at the restaurant and take the other half home for a yummy lunch the next day at work. The reason that I didn't give it 5 starts is because of the price. It's not a place that I can say I'm in love with because I can't afford to go there more than a every once in awhile.

Went for a weekday lunch with the boyfriend because this place was so highly recommended by Matt S (who is  currently"The Duke" here on Yelp's new check-in app). We barely found this place because it's tucked into the corner of a strip mall, right next to a pet groomer and a preschool/daycare. Once we walked in, we noticed that they have a covered patio as well as indoor dining. The tables are covered in butchers block paper (and they gave markers to the tables with kids... although none for me? Hmmmm... I am a kid at heart. Note: I shall ask for markers next time).   I ordered the Deli Sub (ham, salami, and peperoni adorned with veggies, oils, and mayo). #nom. This sandwich was huge, which was maybe my biggest complaint. I literally could not smash the sandwich down enough to fit it in my mouth... I had to pull a bit of the meat off, which made me feel sad for those slices of delicious meaty goodness. For my side, I ordered the pasta salad, which was good (maybe too many onions for my taste, but still good).   And, for dessert, I ordered a scoop of their homemade ice cream - brown sugar & cinnamon flavor. Double #nom.   The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive, checking back on us several times throughout the meal. The 2 other staff that were there at the time also pitched in by clearing plates, which shows that they are a great time and they were laughing with each other which makes for a great atmosphere.

Worst pizza I've had in the state of Arizona... no, wait... ever. I work in a hospital and I'd rather eat the dried out cafeteria pizza any day over this crap.   I dont know who decided it was a good idea to change the name of the business on Yelp (it used to be Zzzzas Pizza) instead of closing Zzzzas and opening a new business as Piza, but it was a terrible idea. Now it looks like Piza Pizza has much better reviews than it does... don't be fooled.   I walked in and the owner was short with me and rude when I asked him what kind of pizzas he had fresh for me to buy a slice. He told me he had every kind of pizza ready. Huh?? So, I ordered a piece of sausage pizza and watched as they threw some sausage on an old piece of pizza and sent it into the warmer/oven. It came out hard as a rock. Nasty.   Also, It's the month of June in Arizona and 110 degrees outside... it's about 120 degrees inside this place. He had the doors propped open and the ovens on. Looks like someone's a cheap ass trying to save on AC costs. Who the heck would want to dine at your restaurant?

This place is located in Downtown Chandler; on Arizona Ave, just south of Chandler Blvd (near San Tan Brewing). It's a fun Irish Pub, with great food and a good variety of beer. A group of 7 of us went for a weekday lunch and they quickly got a few tables together and had us sitting within a few minutes. The service was fantastic the entire time.   The World Cup was on and there were several soccer (football) fans watching the games and getting really into it. A very fun atmosphere.

I took my newly adopted dog (whom I got from the AZ Humane Society) to this vet as the Humane Society has a contract with VCA for free initial checkups. My appointment was made with Dr Funk, not per specific request. We went into the office for our scheduled appointment and the receptionists seemed less than enthusiastic about their jobs (I've never been to a pet-related place, like a vet, pet store, etc, where the employees didn't say hi or give any attention to the animal). We went into the exam room and waited about 10 minutes for the vet tech to come into the room.   Then, after she finished, we waited another 15 minutes for Dr Funk to come in. The doctor was very quick with his exam, and seemed to brush off my questions (about heartworm testing and prevention, and the need for flea and tick protection or dental care). I left with more questions than I came in with.   And, after going to my new vet and having all of my questions answered thoroughly, I realize even more the lack of care I received at this vet office.

If only this place wasn't located so deep in A.J.... but it's been worth the drive on several occasions. This place is the home of my favorite gyro east of the 101. If you go around dinner time, there is usually a line and about a 10-15 min wait to get your food (looks like a pretty small kitchen) but, the wait is less than 5 minutes for lunch in my experience. Their fries have been cooked well, which is another make-or-break for me as far as gyro/hot dog/burger places go for me.

You can't beat a good Vienna Beef hot dog... and Higley Hot Dog makes a good Vienna Beef dog. :) This is a small shop, located right on Williams Field Rd, just west of Higley Rd on the south side of the street- you can't miss it, it's shaped like a hot dog.   They also have other menu items: Gyros, corn dogs, Brats, etc. (just to name a few). I'm a sucker for "mom and pop" type businesses that do business well and this place is one of them. Don't forget your cash... no plastic accepted.

I had been to the Gordon Biersch in Tempe several times before going to this one in GIlbert. I'm not sure I was ever in love with their food (or their microbrew), but the atmosphere in Tempe was always very upbeat and lively, which made it a destination to go out for dinner on a weekend night. But, at this location, it is much quieter, leaving you with only the food and drinks... which aren't anything more special than something along the lines of a Chilis... but, everything is more expensive.   Bottomline: I'd go back if someone else wanted to go, but it wouldnt be a place I would pick myself. Not terrible, but not worth the extra money.

I had a friend in town and we were looking for a nearby pizza place for carryout. I hadn't ever been to Hungry Howies, so decided to give this place a try... and after the one time, I think I'm done. The service was poor- a few high school aged kids that required me to repeat myself several times to get the order straight, and took 5 minutes to run a credit card through the register. The pizza itself was terrible as well. We opted for the original crust (they have flavors like parmasean cheese and garlic). It was a pan-style crust, but was hard as a rock... it might have required a trip to the dentist for a chipped tooth if I had tried any harder to bite into it.  If you're looking for carry-out, try Rosatis

I'm extremely weary of any automotive shop... you all know they have a tendency to do whatever they can, whenever they can, to bleed all of your money out of you. This is one of the first shops that I've seen the opposite. I was at work one day and as I was leaving, I found my car in the parking garage with a flat tire. This was the closest, and the only thing I had to go by in my decision. What great luck that was!   I brought my car in, they said that they could easily patch the tire, but I asked them to replace it since the tire was getting worn. They reminded me of the recommendation to get 2 tires changed at the same time for the sake of balance (i think), so I did. They finished the service very quickly, which was great after 12.5 hours of work. Then, as I was paying, they let me know that their warranty covers the car to be brought back in for FREE rotations and balancing, which I did. They did a free car inspection and found nothing wrong with the alignment (or anything else they checked) which shocked me. I was waiting for the laundry list of things that needed to be fixed and the huge price estimate that would go along with it. But, nope... they were honest and upfront. I'll continue to use this location for all of my tire needs :)

Amazing management staff! We went in on a Friday night and it was busy, so we took a high-top in the bar. We were greeted right away, but with the number of customers they had, it took awhile for our food to come out. The manager came over and asked us if we would like an appetizer or salads on the house and we declined (it didn't even feel like we'd be waiting a long time). The food came out about 5 minutes after the manager left and they brought us a free pizzookie at the end of our meal.   Can't ask for better service! I love their deep dish pizza as well- dead on to Chicago-based places like Giordannos or Lou Malnottis :)

Boy oh boy... my opinion on Blue 32 has changed since my review 3 years ago. I love this place. I'm there at least 3x/month and NOT just because it's so close to my house. Their nachos are my favorite.... yes, my favorite... anywhere. The ground beef has so much frickin' flavor. Nom!   Another favorite is the boneless wings. If they had a "Boneless Wings Anonymous", I think I'd be forced to attend. The wings at Blue 32 live up to my standards.   The service has always been great as well. It gets busy during happy hour and all sports games, so come early if you don't want to wait awhile for a table. The bar area is open seating, so stalk those tables when you walk in.

Anywhere with a Chicago theme... I'm in. So, when we were organizing a double-date night, our foursome (all from Chicago) decided that this was a great place to visit. We were quickly and pleasantly greeted at the door and shown to a very long booth. We ordered some fried mushrooms as an appetizer (not my thing, but everyone said they were delicious). Then, for my main dish, I ordered a meatball sandwich- one word can describe it... HUGE. Needless to say, I had some tasty leftovers to take to work the next day.   Overall, the food was good and the atmosphere was nice. It was a quiet evening, and it seemed like the servers were all very attentive to each of the tables.   No complaints and I'd definitely like to go back.

I'm not a huge fan of guac, but Gall Blanco showed me that there's delicious guac to be had. Nom nom. The other "oh my gosh" find was the corn. Who thought that someone would order corn on the cob as an appetizer? If I didnt before, I do now. Delicious!  Big thanks to Gallo Blanco for hosting the "kiteup"; aka get-together with about 50 Brightkite users. It was indeed warm inside, but with that many people crammed into a small space, it'd be hard to expect otherwise.

This place looked pretty cool when we first walked in (aside from the oh-so bright neon clings littering the outside windows of the bar). The booths are nice with clean tables, big TVs, and a good number of beers on tap.   We asked our server what the specials were, and he showed us the happy hour menu on the table, so we ordered off the menu and he came back a few minutes later to tell us that there was no happy hour on the weekends. Okay.... so, we ordered new drinks. After we received our appetizers, one of my friends asked for a side of ketchup, which we didn't receive until 15 minutes later when there were only 3 bites left. Then, with our meals, he brought the incorrect side item with one of the meals.. the last 2 issues wouldn't have been a big deal, except that the bar was so slow that the server spent most of the night sitting and hanging out with friends/coworkers.   There was also a poker tourney taking place this evening which took up about half of the bar area which was distracting. There were a ton of open tables and they had to set it up at the one right behind us, so that every time someone walked by, they would bump into the back of my chair. Meh.

Went back again... ugh. We took a seat at a high top in the bar and the waiter came up and greeted us very quickly - he was the only redeeming factor in this visit. We ordered an appetizer (spinach artichoke dip) and 2 entrees (the boyfriend ordered a massive lunchmeat style sandwich and I ordered a wrap). It all came out of the kitchen at the same time. Appetizer means "brought out before the food" right? *sigh* So, it was either let the entrees get cold or let the appetizer get cold. Lame.   The wrap I ordered was the chicken caesar wrap and they could have very easily left the word "chicken" out of the name. There were about 8 very small pieces of chicken in the full-sized wrap. It was basically caesar dressed lettuce in a tortilla. Needless to say, I did not feel fulfilled at the end of my meal.   I keep going back because the boyfriend likes their food, but the service is generally bad (not this time though) and their food is mediocre at best in my book. I'm going to have to find somewhere else I can talk him into going when he's in the mood for bar fare.   Too bad there's not many good bars in our area. :(

What can I say? I'm in love. *sigh*  The sweet pork melts in your mouth, the tortillas are slices of heaven... (if you can't guess, the sweet pork is my recommendation)  There are frequently long lines, but they go pretty quickly most of the time. I don't think I've ever waited more than 10 minutes to order. The lines at this location are always shorter than at the Costa Vida on ValVista and Baseline, so that's a plus to get you to head to Queen Creek if you're debating between the 2 locations.

Glad to have a fro yo place closer to the house... I used to drive all the way out to Ahwatukee for a good cup. :) We went this afternoon for the first time and it was surprisingly quiet for a Saturday afternoon. We went in, picked out a few flavors and a few toppings (good selection of each) and paid.   There were two girls working this afternoon and they were both doing small tasks to try and stay busy, like sweeping behind the counter or wiping down the area between the toppings, but lets face it... it's self-service frozen yogurt... is the tip jar really necessary? (pet peeve of mine... don't ask for tips unless you're doing something above and beyond, like the singing and ice cream mixing at Coldstone, for example).    All in all, I'll definitely be back. Excited to use the "mention Yelp for $2 off" deal. :)

I recently did some remodeling work in my living room- knocking out a built-in media niche, moving around the electrical boxes, and redoing the drywall. I called Selberg Electric to see if they could help with the electrical work. Bryan came out to my house and did the work quickly, allowing me to get the drywall finished that same evening. He left everything cleaner than when he started working and ensured everything was working before leaving.

I joined this location on the day of the Grand Opening (late May 2009). I was ecstatic to see a gym open so close to my house. From the outside, it's gorgeous- on the second floor of a building right of the 202.   Amenities:  Cardiovascular machines- treadmills, ellipticals, stair-steppers, bikes, etc. All of the cardio machines have their own TV with headphone jack so you can watch some TV, or hook up your iPod to watch anything you downloaded.  Weights- lots of free weights and Nautilus machines. Plenty of space to move between the equipment.  Locker Room- gorgeous tile showers, sauna, steam room, blow dryers for your use, plenty of locker space (bring your own lock) Childcare- great facility. Lots of the kids to do, complete with a full-size climbing wall. TVs located throughout the facility so you can watch your kids while you workout Theater Room- a place for your husband to sit and watch TV while he waits for you to get ready after the workout (not sure why else you'd need a theater room in a gym) Group Fitness- MY FAVORITE! They have so many different classes throughout the day. Spinning, yoga, plates, step, aerobics, abs & core, etc, etc, etc. Give one a try!  Downsides: Wish they had more benches around the free weights They dont open until 4:30am on weekedays (tough to get in a pre-work workout when you start work at 6am)

This place is so lucky that it's the only non-fast food place in this terminal of Sky Harbor Airport. If there was a better option, we would have gone to that in a heartbeat.   The place is seat yourself, which we did, but that meant that no one knew we were there until we had been sitting down for 10 minutes. We all ordered drinks and after the server brought them, we had to wave him down to order some food... he was very apathetic about his job which detracts from the experience.   Good place for a beer at the bar, perhaps. But as a restaurant ... me thinks not.

I found this place on Yelp while looking for another place to find fabrics since I wasn't finding what I wanted at JoAnn's. So, I popped in one evening about an hour before closing and the women working there were insanely helpful.   I had just bought a sewing machine and was looking for some fabric to make my first "creation", a rag quilt. I went in not really knowing what I wanted, but I told them that I saw a video about rag quilts on YouTube and wanted to try one. So, she had me pick out a few fabrics that I liked together and she helped me figure out how much of each fabric I needed and even gave me some tips for sewing it all together. Way more than I was expecting to get out of my evening at the quilting store!   The only downfall of this store (and reason why I don't go each time I need fabric or supplies) is that the prices are more than at JoAnns. So, I buy all the basics that I can there but will definitely go into Quilters Ranch when I need something special.

BJ's is one of my favorite restaurants in the east valley (and I'm shocked to read the negative reviews done before mine). Over the last 2 years, I've probably been there for a few dozen visits with my biggest complaint being that they are extremely busy during your common weekend meal hours. The servers have always been more than attentive and will even offer free samples of their made-in-house microbrews if you seem unsure of your beer selection. Personally, I get excited each fall for their seasonal selection called "nitwit"- it's a wheat beer, similar to a hef, with a hint of orange just gives it a unique coloring and taste.   They have many options for meals, with some of my favorites being their salads (very large size, I have yet to finish one), their baked potatoes (over a pound, then stuffed with your favorites), chicago-style stuffed pizza, and signaure sandwiches (the crispy chicken is my favorite, by far). And, of course, you can't pass up dessert at BJ's- they have pizzookies. For anyone who might not have already been introduced, a pizzookie is a big cookie (in a personal pizza sized pan), baked to be slightly gooey with a couple scoops of ice cream on top.

Today was my second visit to this office and I was just as impressed as I was on my first trip. It was relatively easy to make an appointment a few weeks out for a routine check-up & cleaning. On my first appointment, they made molds for teeth whiting gel at no charge and they have a deal going where you will get free whiting gel at each visit as long as you keep up with your check-ups. That's pretty cool in itself.   The office was really nice (I uploaded a picture of the lobby). The patient rooms were high-tech as well. Each room has a computer where they pulled up my file, could access x-rays, and add real time notes from my check-up. They also had flat screen TVs in each room so I could watch TV before or during the cleaning.   The staff is great- very friendly & helpful.

Went into this local eatery with about 10 friends on a Sunday afternoon for an impromptu lunch. The staff was very friendly and did their best to get us in & out quickly as we only had and hour before we had to head back to a conference. The waitress took our orders quickly, and brought our food out one at a time to speed things up. Everyone's food looked good- mostly standard bar fare such as burgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese, etc.   The bar itself had a strong Midwestern theme, with Chicago, Wisconsin, and Minnesota sports memorabilia (see photos). Since we were there on a Sunday, they had football going on all of their TVs, so it looks like a great place to chill out and watch some sporting events. They also had an outdoor patio (with another TV) if the weather draws you outdoors.   This place is located right at Elliot Road & 48th Street in the shopping plaza with Safeway. Check it out if you're in the area.

I love small business... so I'm always disappointed when I can't give a rave review. We went to Hillside Spot after a race (running) so we were starved. I went to the counter and ordered an OJ and pancakes. They took our order quickly and gave us a number for the table. It took about 15 minutes, but they brought us the plates of food... but no drinks. The employee said "it's by the register." So, I went back inside, grabbed an OJ out of the cooler (wish the person taking our order would have mentioned that) and went back outside. As I sat down to eat my pancakes (again, I was starving), I noticed that there was no silverware. So, I went back inside and noticed it was on a separate table behind the cash registers.... again, I wish they would have mentioned that it wouldn't come out with the food. THEN, there was no syrup with the pancakes. So, I went back inside AGAIN and had to wait for someone to pour me syrup into a cup and they even got the syrup all over the outside of the cup, which I had to carry back outside. Finally, I was able to sit down and eat. The pancakes were good, but nothing to get super excited about. They definitely filled the void- just glad they weren't cold after I had to run back inside 3 times to get everything I needed.   Not impressed with the employees- they didn't do a single thing to go out of their way to make this an exceptional experience. If they would have told me about the OJ at the register and checked if we needed anything else when dropping off the food, I surely would have given this a better review. Hopefully they'll do better for future guests.

I... love... this... park. It's fantastic! Built on a landfill, it was designed wonderfully by the City of Chandler giving great views of the city to anyone who visits. The park seems to be separated into four areas - dog parks, kid park, disc golf, and archery range. There is a walking/jogging trail around the park as well.   The only part of the park that I have personally used is the dog parks. They have 2 separate dog areas which are opened on a rotating basis so the ground doesn't get over-run with all the four-legged friends. The dog areas have water fountains (both human and dog sized), benches for the humans to sit, and pooper scoopers to clean up after your pooch. This is by far the cleanest dog park I've been to in the east valley; the dog owners have been more or less responsible (more than at other dog parks) and I've seen city workers in the dog areas several times. My dog loves it!  We've also taken a stroll around the park and seen the kids play areas. It looks like most of the equipment is made out of recycled materials - old tires, old construction equipment, and all done in a safe manner. The kids we saw looked like they were having a great time.

I've really grown to enjoy Hawaiian BBQ over the last year, so I was excited to try the new place. We walked in and went up to the counter to place our to-go order. The woman at the counter was very friendly and was perhaps the owner as she was telling us about the different flavors of the Hawaiian Juices that she orders.   It took a few minutes to cook up our food (but we heard it cooking so we knew it was fresh) and she brought it out to us. After getting the food home, I dove into my Chicken Katsu and my boyfriend ate his Spam Musubi and LocoMoco. He really enjoyed his food and I thought that mine was average. We used to eat at Ono Hawaiian BBQ often and I would have to say that I prefer Ono's version of the Katsu because the chicken is meatier at Ono, while at Hawaiian Sun, there seemed to be more bread. I also wished that I had noticed that she only included one side of Katsu sauce.   Bottomline: I'd go back, but since it's a few miles from the house, I dont see it as a frequent dining option. I'd recommend giving it a try to anyone who's thinking about it.

Called Magic Pest Control to go out to my home to do a routine pest spray. It was really easy to schedule an appointment.   He showed up to my house, right on time (and even wiped his feet on the doormat before coming in). He went through the home interior, spraying each room. He then went outside and sprayed my yard and around the exterior.   No problems, nice guy, good service.

We live just down the road and I drive by this place every day on my way to/from work. So, we decided to call in an order and go and pick it up. We checked out their menu online and called in the order- the woman on the phone was nice and let us know our order would be ready in about 20 minutes.   We headed in and our food was ready on time as promised. We ordered spaghetti & meatballs (which came with garlic bread), a meatball sandwich, and a single antipasta salad. The spaghetti was good but I felt like the garlic bread was lacking; it was more like a toasted pita with garlic spread on it.   The meatball sandwich was good... fries were a bit soggy. The biggest disappointment however was the fact that the antipasta salad came without black olives (I did double check the menu which said that it was supposed to). Black olives are the whole reason that I love the anitpasta salad. *sigh*

Vienna Beef FTW! Any hot dog place that proudly serves Vienna Beef is a hot dog place for me. After a lesson on the history of Vienna Beef from the boyfriend's iPhone, we were in the mood for some good Chicago-style hot dogs and since we were in the area (on the way back from a Cubs/White Sox spring training game), we stopped in. I used to live in this area and had been here several times when it was under a different name and it's still as delicious. It seems to me that they're still using the same good products.   We both got the "hot dog and fries basket" which was just as it sounds. Good hot dog, served with all the fixin's (or however you request): mustard, onions, relish, tomatoes, cucumber salt, and sport peppers. Nom.   Lots of sports memorabilia on the walls- great for looking around while you wait for you food to be cooked fresh to order.

I didn't even know this location was there... score! We were leaving the mall on a Saturday morning, just before lunchtime and saw this BWW. We went in, got a seat at a table near the bar and were promptly greeted. We ordered the fried pickles (my fav) and I had a chicken wrap. Yum.   The location was very clean and since it was a Saturday, they had a bunch of different NCAA football games on the TVs. Another group of people requested that one of the big TVs be changed to a specific game and they changed it within seconds.   Would definitely go back.

The park itself is a good size, with Polar Ice sitting right in the middle of it. In the front of the lot is the dog park (see more about that in a second), and the back half has a few baseball diamonds, and a walking trail that goes around a cute lake. Very pretty and well maintained area.   The dog park is a smaller-sized fenced in area (in comparison to nearby Cosmo Dog Park), but it's much cleaner than any of my several experiences at Cosmo. There are 2 separate areas: one for timid dogs and one for active dogs. They have containers that hold plastic bags to pick up dog waste, but it didn't seem as though the town supplied the bags- the containers were filled with plastic shopping bags from Fresh N Easy, Safeway, Fry's, etc so maybe the patrons bring a supply each time they come to pitch in? Either way, I didn't see a single piece of dog poop anywhere in either of the yards.

I stumbled upon Bare Necessity Wax & Spa by chance, but am so thankful that I did. Amy was fantastic - she made me feel very comfortable from the minute I walked in the door. She uses a strip-free wax (where i goes on warm, hardens a bit, then gets pulled off without the use of fabric strips). She did a fabulous job with the shaping and my eyebrows looked great.   I made my next appointment right then and there and will definitely be back.   Bare Necessity Wax & Spa is located inside Vintage Salon, on the northeast corner of Higley & Ray. It is in the buildings behind Fresh N Easy, Wells Fargo, & the daycare.

We found Clearly Professional though the web. Upon calling, we were quickly able to make an appointment. Brad, the owner, was at our house on time and did an amazing job on our windows. He was extremely thorough, taking down all the sun screens and cleaning those as well. I was amazed that our windows could look so good!   Brad is a very personable guy, one that I would trust being at my house when I'm not home even. He even brought in our trash bin from the curb to our side yard without our asking... who else would do that??? He was great. He was also able to re-screen our over sized, ripped screen door for a very reasonable price.   I look forward to using Clearly Professional Window Cleaning again!

We saw this place as we were leaving the froyo place across the street and came back later that week to check it out. It's on the North side of Williams Field Rd, west of ValVista (in the strip next to Blue 32 Sports Grill). We walked in and went straight up to the counter to order; the employee was nice & helpful taking our orders and payment quickly. We then waited by one of the tables as we ordered to go. One of the managers/owners (I assume) came over to us and started talking when he saw Chuck take a picture of their wall mural. After Chuck said he was taking the picture to put on Yelp, the guy was like "are you guys going to write a review?" and asked us what we ordered and gave us their "sub sauce" to try - very nice guy.   After we got home, I dug into my original cheesesteak and it was delicious. The meat had great flavor and had the perfect amount of cheese on it (maybe a few too many onions for my taste, but no biggie). Their fries were amazing - I have no idea why they were so good, but they had the perfect texture/consistency that I wish I had room for more in my belly.   Excited to go back and try something else off their menu.

I love BLD... LOVE it. I can't get enough of their breakfast foods - especially the Monte Cristo. Who wouldn't love yummy pieces of ham, slathered with raspberry preserved and sandwiched between two thick pieces of french toast. Yum! With potatoes on the side, too. Double yum.   I've been several times, for breakfast, lunch & dinner. Breakfast is served until 2pm or so, but after 3pm (ish) the menu changes to dinner only (which is my only complaint... I wish I could have breakfast any time of the day). Their lunch sandwiches have all been delicious and their happy hour menu is pretty darn good too.   There is a full bar for all of your booze needs & a wonderfully comfortable outdoor patio. One big highlight for me is that BLD has a dog-friendly patio. I can bring my pooch with me after a trip to the dog park (Paseo Vista dog park isn't too far from BLD). They always offer me a water bowl when she's with me & even sometimes have massive dog bones.   The staff have all been fantastic - friendly and knowledgeable. I look forward to going back each time!

I totally love Coach and Willie's. They have a great atmosphere & the wait staff have been really friendly and prompt each time I've been in there. I've been there more as a lunch spot than a nighttime hangout. At lunchtime, the place is pretty full, but not too full that the staff are overworked and unable to provide great service. The food is definitely above average... delicious actually.   The biggest downside is the price at Coach & Willies. It's a bit too expensive. But obviously not too bad because I keep going back :)

Wow. How have I not gone to this place sooner?!?! My favorite fast food place in the midwest was/is Steak N Shake and this tastes pretty darn similar. The burgers are thin, but cooked to a crispy perfection & the fries are thin and awesome as well. On my first trip, I had the patty melt, which was awesome. On my second trip, I had a burger and it was amazing. And on my third trip, I went for the hot dog and it was outstanding :) Have yet to be disappointed by the food at Freddy's.   Next, we have the customer service here, which is top notch. There are a bunch of young kids behind the counter, but they all seem to have an impeccable work ethic and great manners. I don't know how the managers go about their hiring process, but they're doing a great job.   Lastly, frozen custard... just do it. You won't regret it :)

Really terrible customer service  Walked up with a friend on a "busy" Saturday night (no wait at the door, but no open tables). The 3 hostesses stood there staring at us - no "Hi", no "Welcome to Cogburns"... nothing. I said "hi, there's 2 of us" and she said "We're full. You can check outside". That was my first clue on their bad service. We ended up sitting outside, under their misters which spewed so much water that we literally had to drag our heavy table to the other end of the patio because our hair, clothes, and even our menus were getting soaked. The waitress watched us dragging our table and didn't offer to help or even comment on the situation. She checked on us during our stay a fair amount until the end of the night came. We sat with empty glasses and plates for almost 20 minutes before she came by to see if we wanted anything else. Then it took another 10 minutes to bring the bill (the place was empty by this point in the night). Then, after waiting 10 minutes with our credit cards on the table, I had to take them inside myself to try and find the waitress. Aaaaand where did I find her? Just inside the door talking to a friend loudly about a relationship issue she was having. She looked at me like I was being rude asking her to run my credit card.   My note to the owners of Cogburns: talk to your young staff members about the importance of customer service. Decent food will only get you so far. There are several other bars I'm the East Valley with equal or better food quality with customer service that surpasses what your staff is offering.   The 2nd star was given for the wings. They were nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The raspberry chipotle sauce was tasty.

I was referred to this company by another landscaping company who didn't serve the east valley. Dave responded almost immediately to my email inquiry and was able to come out to my house on my next available day. He gave me an upfront quote (although a little higher than other companies), I decided to go with them because of the ease of communication. He came out as promised and the work got done quickly by him & his team of guys.   I'll definitely use AZ Landscaping Co for my future landscaping/irrigation needs.

AZ Landscaping CO came out to my house again for a 2nd job. Dave emailed me back right away and scheduled the service. They showed up on time as expected, did everything promised and even went above and beyond by taking out a pile of palm leaves that I had on the side of my house (waiting until garbage day).

Was pleasantly surprised when we tried out this "new" (7 months now) pizza place in Gilbert tonight. We ordered a medium half-and-half pizza (half Carnitas Libre and half Quattro). Both specialty pizzas were great. The crust was good... not too much or too little and the toppings seemed fresh.   The interior has a bar area to the right and a dining room to the left - lots of big booths in the diring room which we liked a lot. The service was fantastic; Gabriell took great care of us and gave us her expert recommendations, which worked perfectly for us.   They also have a carry-out door, nice outdoor patio & a huge selection of beers on tap. We'll definitely be back.

I was so excited to see another non-chain eatery open in our neighborhood. My first visit was great and each time thereafter has gotten a bit worse.   Visit #1 - I ordered a BLT - it was great - piled high with bacon and the fries were steak-cut and cooked perfectly.   Visit #2 - I ordered a 4 cheese flat-bread over the phone. She insisted that she needed my credit card number for phone orders (which I don't like doing over the phone for security purposes). Upon picking up my order, I had to wait 15 minutes to get to the counter to pick up my food because of the line. By the time I got home (I live 1.3 miles away), my food was cold. On top of the coldness, the flat-bread was not covered with cheeses (the outer inch and a half had no cheese on it and was hard as a rock). A $5 grab and go pizza from Little Caesars (which I dont like) would have been better  Visit #3- ordered the BLT again because I wanted to eat something I knew I liked. This time, they only had 2 pieces of bacon on each half of the sandwich. The bread to bacon ratio was far to low... disappointing. On top of that, the fries were undercooked and soggy. Doubly disappointing.   Visit #4- I ordered the sliders. However, after tasting my husband's Mac n Cheese during our last visit, I asked for the fries instead of the mac n cheese (the mac is dry, clumped together, and bland). And, of course they messed it up. They substituted the onion straws for the fries instead of the mac, so I got the fries and the mac. The mac was gross, just as it was the last visit and the fries were undercooked and soggy... also like the last visit.   Three strikes and you're out, The Spot. I shall not be returning.

I am really enjoying this tanning salon. I've been to a few in the area and this one has proven to have the most friendly and knowledgeable staff and highest quality beds.   The salon is set up so that you walk in, use your fingerprint to access your account, use the self-serve computer to pick your bed, number of minutes, and help yourself. This is set up this way because this company is set up to be a 24/7 salon, but they are currently awaiting local legal permission to do so in this area.

The salon was really clean and they had plenty of staff working to take care of everyone. It was decently crowded - about 8 people there on a Friday (late morning).   It seems like it might be hit-or-miss with the staff members though. I did the upgraded $25 pedicure and was a little disappointed with the pumice and massage portions of the pedicure. She just really wasn't into it... definitely half-assing it. Seemed like other employees were more committed to their job. Maybe she was just having a bad day?   Lots of nail polish colors - more than most other salons in the area

This is probably my favorite happy hour location in Gilbert - you can't beat the specials. $5 pitchers of beer, $5 Margaritas, $5 Agua Frescas (before 5pm). Plus, they have taco tuesdays. The place gets busy for sure, but the staff has been great every time I've been in.   The outdoor patio is spacious (and dog friendly!).

Paradise is one of my favorite spots for a quick bite. I love almost everything on their menu, which is mostly sandwiches, salads, and soups. They also have a bakery counter, which serves all sorts of goodies (brownies, pastries, cookies, parfaits, etc). But, as a special treat, when you order a sandwich, you get a free chocolate chip cookie on the side.   This location is in SanTan Mall (if you enter off Williams Field Rd, turn in at the light and head straight back- it will be on your right about a block into the mall). Parking is somewhat difficult, as it is located on the outskirts of a mall, but if you have other shopping to do, it makes it convenient.

Long wait time for breakfast on a Friday at 10am (with only 8-10 tables full). The waitress was  nice, but the food overall was mediocre (I'd just as readily go to Dennys or IHOP). The bench seats were torn and it looked like it could use a deep cleaning.   On an upside, the biscuits and gravy were pretty good though.
