The staff was friendly and my pedicure was AMAZING! I did the OPI Deluxe Pedicure ($32) and the massage was incredible, seemed to last forever and it didn't feel rushed at all. She was thorough and I did not feel like I had to be very specific at all, she knew what she was doing!   My fill on the other hand... That's where I was highly disappointed. A gentleman did my fill, he started out ok, however, when he was filing my nail, he grazed my skin which hurt a lot. As soon as my sister called and I was talking to her on the phone, he got really short, at one point he told me he was going to need my hand so I had to get off the phone. I simply held my phone against my shoulder because I don't get to talk to my sister very much as she lives out of state.   I felt as though he was rushed and my nails looks uneven as he was applying the fill. He didn't take his time as he was painting my nails either, it came out extremely sloppy, uneven and really gross looking. He left residue under my fingernails as well, which of course I didn't notice until after I left because he rushed me out of the chair, demanded I pay right after he put oil in my hands and he didn't honor the 10% off discount as a first time customer...  Highly disappointed with the way my fill turned out... And the customer service from that gentleman. Prices aren't posted anywhere on website or in the salon.

I went in for a consultation on Tuesday, thankfully they squeezed me in and took great care of me! I scheduled my appointment for color painting on Thursday (the day I had my photoshoot). WOW. Whitney did an INCREDIBLE JOB!   I hadn't colored my hair in over two years and did a lot of research before I took the plunge. With great reviews from friends, I felt so confident and comfortable walking into Habit Salon. They delivered SPECTACULARLY!

I had been going to cloud9 since the beginning of the new management in 2014. I am a loyal customer and have always been pleased with my services, the friendly staff and management. I went in today, to get my acrylic nails removed and have gels put on. As soon as I sat down I informed the nail tech I wanted him to soak my nails instead of attempting to rip the acrylics off (I have done this before and it has been painful and would have rather sat for longer than be in pain. He disregarded what I asked and after he hurt me twice, I firmly said, "I need you to soak my nails." It took them forever. The man ended up going to the back and  a woman took over.  I ended up getting a pedicure, at the woman's suggestion, while I uncomfortably soaked my nails in a single bowl of acetone. The pedicure was rushed because three walk-ins arrived right after she started the pedicure process and there were only two people working, including the lady that was doing my pedicure. When she went to put on the temporary flip flops, she wiped off some of the paint on my big toe. She painted over it quickly which left a bump of paint on my toe.   After my pedicure, she proceeded to take off my nails, I told her I no longer wanted to get the gel manicure because I didn't have time. From then on her whole demeanor changed, she rushed getting my acrylics taken off, didn't file them down (they are completely uneven and there was even hanging nails) and asked me to pay. I told her my displeasure how I have never had an experience like this. I handed her my card as I was telling her, she slid it and I told her This is a service I wouldn't pay for, I could've done this myself. She told me she wouldn't charge my card and cancelled the transaction. I later got a notification of my card being charged $37 (for the nail removal and pedicure). I called Iimmediately. I told her I wanted to speak to the manager (who previously was Trisha; I was speaking to the new manager Kathy), that my card shouldn't have been charged and I want a refund. She responded by saying, "I don't have money to refund you, I just spent all that time with you." I told her that she charged my card without authorization, and she said "You come back In and I fix for you." I responded by saying I don't have time to come back in for you to fix it, nor will I come back in and have you mediocrely "fix" my nails which you ruined in the first place. She apologized and said "Happy New Year" as I told her I woll be disputing the charge with my bank. Save yourself the time, don't come here. In 2015 it was wonderful, but the new management has ruined it, not mention they charge cards when they said they wouldn't.  If I could give 0 stars, I would.

I'm not a professional pizza reviewer by any means, but I know good service, good food and a good restaurant when I see one. NYPD's slick modern decor and friendly service staff was the perfect first impression. My husband and I sat at a booth, tucked away and private, browsing over the menu until a smiley waitress came over to see if we had any questions.   I ordered a local ally brewed Mill Blonde Ale which was the perfect pairing with our Brooklyn Family and Big Kahuna slices of pizza. The fresh tomato sauce and toppings were spread creating a perfectly portioned thin crust pizza.  For starters we ordered the Crispy Fresh Mozzarella, which I would have ate as a meal all by itself! The fresh mozzarella was breaded to a crisp on top of a bed of green spinach lettuce accompanied by deliciously red tomato slices. The sauces included a thick balsamic and chunky red sauce for dipping.   We finished off the evening stub a Cookies N' Cream chocolate chip pan cookie topped with vanilla ice cream whipped cream and a cherry to share. It was a perfectly cooked, warm and gooey,  treat after a hearty meal.  Overall, the experience was delightful and the small serving staff makes it feel homey with reduced chaos compared to other Pizza Restaurants.

This nail salon gets 5 stars! Why? Because I've been to my fair share of nail salons and this one meets all my expectations. I didn't feel rushed, I felt like the artist listened to my desires, and that the money you spend is absolutely worth the service you receive. I'm so glad that I've FINALLY found a nail salon that I feel comfortable at. No judgement, just simply incredible service.  BONUS: Pearl Nails & Spa offer discounts to students, a discount on your birthday and many more great incentives!

Jesse was great! So professional and even with my husband away at work, I felt comfortable.   He absolutely detailed every inch of the vehicle. It was spotless, vacuumed, shiny, not a bug on the bumper or a streak on a window!   Definitely save time and money and have the Clean Green Wash and Wax take care of you!
