Gary at Impact Printing is the man! He goes out of his way to give great service and I love that they will deliver items locally by courier. No need to get in the car. Just email proofs to him and they arrive shortly, hand delivered. This is a great way to support a local printing company, without sacrificing quality and service. They can compete with the big boys on pricing and products. Highly recommend.

My kids love coming here. The staff is exceptional and have really made a difference in my kids ability to swim. There is a huge viewing gallery for parents to watch behind glass. There is one big changing area for everyone and then individual rooms as well. They have a small kids play area for toddlers. My kids love to eat dinner at the snack bar after late swim lessons. It is perfect, they change out of their swim suits into their PJs, have hot dogs or chicken fingers at the snack bar then off to home and directly to bed. Every night you see tons of families and kids doing the same thing. Very cute.

One of the best public courses in North Scottsdale. It very family friendly and they are used to having young junior golfers on the course. I find the course to be in very good condition whenever we are there. The staff in the pro shop are always pleasant and helpful. The snack bar could be better. It has a very limited selection and it is a little hidden. I doubt most golfers even know that there is one there. Usually we end up going to the restaurant instead, which is great, but does not have a very good kids menu. It would be nice if they had a more elaborate selection at the snack bar for quick and cheap grab and go food.

I have been to this restaurant dozens of times throughout the years. I find the steaks are always good, but the seafood is really hit or miss. Was there yesterday and my lobster was totally over cooked. It was like complete rubber. It was barely edible. I should have known better to order it there, but I love surf and turf so I gave it a shot. Very disappointing.

Enjoyed a fantastic evening in a private suite at Chase Field. The food was unexpectedly amazing. I knew the suite was expensive so you should get something decent. It was on par with a fine restaurant in terms of presentation, quality and service. We had exotic fruit, prime rib, fine wine etc. The food was served in silver chaffing dishes. The furniture was high quality upholstery and we had a private restroom. Definitely the way to watch the game.

I just purchased my second car from World Motors. They were courteous, fast and efficient. No slimy salespeople here. Everyone is super professional. I got an amazing deal and I couldn't be happier. I paid about $10,000 less than Schumacher wanted for the same Mercedes. It is a small dealership so they don't have much to choose from. You need to be patient and wait for the right car. I just kept checking their website for inventory. They are my go-to people for used Mercedes in Scottsdale.

I won't go to this Starbucks location again. I usually drive through and have been here dozens of times. One day, my son needed to use the restroom so we went inside. The restrooms were filthy. Makes me never want to go to this location again. I'll stick to the Starbucks in Grayhawk on Thompson Peak Pkwy.

The kids meals are totally overpriced. My kids are super picky eaters. This severely limits where we can go as a family. All my son wants is a peanut butter and jam sandwich. Honestly he is happy if he can have two slices of bread with peanut butter on one side and jam on the other. 7 bucks for this at Paradise Bakery with one cookie and a juice box. Come on....give a family a break. That is ok for an adult combo but we are talking about two slices of bread and a tablespoon of PB and J. Wow...have to just keep on walking next time.

I had the locks changed on one of my rental properties. The technician was prompt, courteous and very professional. I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because I had to wait a day and a half for an appointment. Overall a very positive experience. I felt that I chose the right company.

Love this place. Tiny little coffee shop with an upscale feeling. The outdoor shady patio under the trees is the best place to sit and relax. It is attached to the Grayhawk Golf clubhouse so you see lots of golfers running in an out before or after their tee times. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because they are quick to serve the coffee or mufffins on display. But getting an omelete takes a while. If you aren't in a rush that's fine, but they seem to be much better staffed for the front counter than the back kitchen.

Uggh obviously the new hip place in North Scottsdale...but the staff is rude and lie to you. We called ahead and told them we were on our way with a party of 8. I know it is a large party but I wanted them to be prepared. The girl who answered the phone said it would be an hour but come on in. When we got there they were packed. People everywhere, probably 50 people standing around waiting for a table. I thought uh oh this doesn't look good but she assured us that there were several big parties about to leave and it would still be an hour. So we stayed. We kept checking with the front staff and they kept saying the next big table to leave would be ours. Hour and fifteen minutes later a big table of 8 got up to leave and the waiters  separated the tables into two tables of four. Hostess totally lied to us and wasted over 2 hours of our night with drive time. Totally embarrassing as we were with another family from out of town. Clearly they don't care about their customers or lying to people to their faces. I will never go back again.
