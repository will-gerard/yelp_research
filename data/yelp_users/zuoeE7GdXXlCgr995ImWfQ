A good location. Everything here is always fresh, the line moves quickly, and the staff is always pleasant.

Pizza Heaven is the perfect lunch spot. It is such a good deal and very tasty pizza. For around $5 you get a slice of pizza, salad, and drink - and for a small up charge you can get any toppings you want on your single slice. Most places in the area charge way more for pizza of this quality and you can't order just a single slice the way you like it. I'm a fan!

We tried Coup Des Tartes last weekend with the Groupon they offered. We had heard it was a decent BYOB restaurant and figured it was worth a try.  I am so happy we did!!!   The appetizers or "small plates" were the best part of the meal. We ordered the salmon pate special, the onion tart, and the brie. The salmon pate was amazing! I was worried when I ordered it thinking there were so many ways it could come out badly, but it was incredible. The consistency was perfect and it came with a nice assortment of vegetables and crackers. Even better than the salmon, was the brie. OMG, just perfect. I thought it wouldn't be any better than what I could buy in the cheese section of Trader Joe's, but BOY was I wrong. It was cooked perfectly covered in baked apples and just so tasty.  The worst appetizer of the three, but still really nice was the onion tart. The only reason I didn't care as much for it because it was on the sweeter side. For our entree we split a filet. The filet was really nice, but not anything that stood apart from anywhere else.   I would recommend coming to Coup Des Tartes for the adorable atmosphere, wonderful small plates, and to bring your own bottle! If you go for this, you cannot go wrong!!!

I want to start out this review by saying - I am never going back to Moto.   I went there one time with a group. I was excited to try a new sushi place and normally really love sushi. However, there was a really bad odor when I walked in so I opted against trying the fish there out of fear of food poisoning. I can't comment on how the sushi is at Moto. Instead, I decided to try the Pho. I have eaten Pho at many places around town and typically enjoy it. Not at Moto. The broth was a darker color than I am used to and had a funny after taste. I couldn't even get through about 1/4 of it before I lost my appetite.   Most of the other members of my group didn't like the food much either. My advice is that there are too many other places near Moto for good sushi and pho to risk trying this place.

I have been going to Miracle Mile for years and years, and in my opinion it is still the best deli in town. Years ago, it was even better than it is now (hard to imagine), but it still has all of classics cooked to perfection.   It is hard to go wrong with anything on the menu, but my favorites are the daily specials. Try them if you haven't already, especially the beef stew on Tuesdays and the fish on Fridays.  There is not much else to say - if you want cafeteria style deli and you want it done right - this is the place to get it.

I can't say enough good things about Postino. As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best food overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of ingredients).    If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good.   Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic.   Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a tray of bruschetta! It cannot be beat!!

LOVE sakana. One of the best places for sashimi in town! Nothing beats the salmon sashimi here. The rolls are mediocre with a few exceptions, but the quality of the fish makes up for it.

Houston's may be pricey, but it doesn't disappoint!   My favorite entree is the filet salad. It is AMAZINg, but everything on the menu is excellent and they have wonderful wine to pair with any meal.   I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a consistent and nice dinner in the area.

Dr. Cohen is extremely professional, but also makes you feel very comfortable asking questions. He spends a lot of time with his patients and is truly concerned with their well being. My family and I have been coming here for years and always have a positive experience. His staff is very knowledgeable and attentive (and unlike most doctor's offices they actually answer the phone - every time!).   I highly recommend Dr. Cohen to anyone!

I used to love the Melting Pot years back, but when I tried it again more recently, I couldn't remember for the life of me why.  The reason for my 2 stars is for the poor food quality. The only thing saving my review from one star is the comparable atmosphere and the concept. The concept is really fun, I mean, who doesn't like fondu? The cheese dip was just mediocre at best and tasted like something I could make at home by just melting down some cheddar cheese. The salad was nothing special and the meat/seafood wasn't a good quality. My biggest disappointment was the filet as it was super tough and fatty. Unfortunately, I expect more for the prices and my experience there left much to be desired.

We love lox, stock and bagel. It is a great neighborhood breakfast place. The food prices are slightly high, but I guess you pay a premium for convenience. The bagels and lox are amazing here, but the freshness of the vegetables are hit and miss which is why I give it the 4 star rating. THe side dishes are also mediocre and I wouldn't suggest paying extra for the tuna or egg salad.

I love the food here. They have great pizza and even better salads.   My favorite things on their menu are the panzanella salad and the deep dish pizza.  The panzanella is one of my favorites salads in town. However, you can't go wrong with anything!   They also deliver, which is awesome!

I LOVE Crazy Jim's. It is super crowded at lunch time and lacks the most comfortable seating, but that's OK because they DELIVER!  I haven't had anything bad on their menu, but the by far the best dish is the crazy salads. All of them are amazing and there's nowhere else in town to get a salad like that - no lettuce but cucumbers, cabbage, tomatoes, etc. instead. The feta cheese and pita bread that come with the salad both taste like they are made there from scratch - if they aren't you can't tell the difference. They also have the best salad dressings in town. The creamy greek and roquefort are my favorites. Both are a must try!  Next time you have a busy day at work and can't make it out of the office for lunch, call Crazy Jim's and you won't regret it!

After all of these years, it is still a great restaurant.   For around $10 you can get the best turkey and stuffing in town as well as a nice little salad bar!   This restaurant's name suits it perfectly. If you want some home cooking/comfort food for a decent price this is the place to go. For me it is like Thanksgiving year round.   What more can you ask for?

I love that they have a "different" menu. Lots of unique choices - all good!   My usual go to is the chopped salad with the lox and couscous. It is definitely my favorite, but everything here is good!   Try something you normally wouldn't eat here and you won't be sorry!

Fantastic happy hour. If the fish tacos, guacamole and tortilla soup weren't amazing enough on the happy hour menu...they even make a terrific burger! You just can't go wrong with anything on the happy hour menu.   As for the regular menu, haven't had anything I didn't like but the best are definitely the fish dishes paired with the street corn!   Mmm, will be back soon!

Been here a few times and each time we have a solid meal. Their strength is definitely consistency.   They have a fantastic rotisserie chicken that you can purchase to go or eat in the restaurant. It is what they are known for. My favorite entree is the Macho salad which is a really nice combination of the rotisserie chicken, toasted cornbread, fresh veggies, avocado, etc.   Last time we were there we also tried the ribs and they are excellent. The meat just fell of the bone and the sauce wasn't too heavy.   If you like rotisserie/BBQ, this place is for you!

Good food all the time. No exceptions.   I absolutely love the bar area. If you sit up at the "chef's table" Razz will make you whatever he has and feels like nightly until you say stop. It is something like $10 a course and they are on the smaller size, but nothing short of fantastic.  Also, just an FYI - Razz is only here about 1/2 of the year, and the rest of the year the restaurant is closed, so go while you can!

There really isn't a better place to drink wine than Terrior. It is such a fun neighborhood place. They have the best wine selection and even do wine flights for just $15. The patio is really nice and also dog friendly  They have lots of fun events also. Anything from trivia night to vino and canvas.  The best part of Terrior is the wine club though. For $30 a month they will hand select 2 wines for you that are never a miss.   Terrior is a must try! Love It!!!

I saw a Groupon for Cove Trattoria so I decided to give it a try. I had a salmon salad for lunch. I thought it was quite nice. The salmon was flavorful and cooked well and the salad was simple, but nice. The service was really good and everyone was very friendly.  Nothing really stood out about the experience, but it was a solid meal and I enjoyed it. If you like their menu, you can definitely expect a nice meal and great service.

We decided to try this place because we saw it on TV on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, but realize now that should have been a reason not to try it. Barrio Cafe is overpriced and underwhelming.   On the show we saw the chef prepare a chili  relano, but when we went to order it, there's none on the menu. Instead, we went for the chicken enchiladas and fish tacos. We started with the "award winning" horchata.   We must have got some from the bottom of the barrel because it was super grainy and gross. I didn't even drink mine at $5.50. The tacos and enchiladas were both fine, but nothing special.  With the amount of hype surrounding this place we expected more - especially for $20 a person or more.

Really bad food. We ordered their "special"  of the day which was the lobster hash and a quiche. The lobster really chewy and smelled really fishy. They wouldn't accommodate a fried egg on top of the hash instead of scrambled either. The quiche was cold in the center and seemed like it was reheated in the microwave. We asked to get something different instead and ordered a cobb salad and blueberry muffin which we hoped would be safer choices, but alas, they were not. The salad was really small for a $17 dollar salad and really gross chunks of bacon fat in it. The blueberry muffin appeared as if it had been microwaved as well and was dried out. Lunch was practically inedible and with all of our complaints a manager never so much as looked out way. We were extremely dissapointed!  Oh also water is $7 and they won't tell you there is a charge until you get the bill!

This is the best pizza I have had in Arizona hands down - it is even better than NYC pizza, in my opinion. After trying multiple different pizzas I have come to the conclusion they are amazing and when you can't decide which of two you want from the menu, they have no problem letting you do half and half which is great. They will even let you mix the sauce pizzas with the white pizzas.  However, it isn't just pizza that is outstanding here. They have some of the best menu items I have tried anywhere, generally speaking. One of the best being the most tasty cheese plate I've ever had.  My suggestion is that if you have not yet been here that you stop whatever you are doing and head there now - your stomach will thank you.

YC's is just so tasty!  I have been going to YCs for over a decade and I've never had a bad expierience. love the idea of mongolian grill in general, but what is great about YC's compared to a lot of other mongolian grills is that the sauces are on the lighter side and everything is always fresh.  You basically make it yourself - so it is hard to go wrong!

Not only does Wildfish has a really great happy hour, but they have the best crab cakes and lobster bisque I have had in Arizona. The seafood is very fresh and every dish I've had there has been excellent. The staff is also very nice as well as the management. I will be eating here for a long time to come!

I was debating giving this resort three stars, but I decided the cons were to gross.   The pros: It is situated on a beautiful landscape. The rooms are private and spacious. The rooms are very pretty with a nice fireplace and gorgeous patio.  The staff around the property is friendly. There is a golf cart service to take you from the rooms to the front of our hotel.   The cons: The room wasn't very clean. There were a few spots of blood on the pillowcase and an obviously dirty tub. We asked for both of these things to be fixed while we went out to dinner. We came back to clean sheets, but the same dirty tub. We didn't want to ask again because at that point the cleaning would impede on our time together. It was a shame we couldn't use the tub during our stay.   Our room wasn't ready for us at check in and they refused to let us have late checkout - in fact - they were downright rude about it.  Unfortunately, what had the potential to be an amazing stay was disappointing and underwhelming...

What isn't there to like about Ocean Club? I'd like to start off by saying this review is for the bar only. I'd rate the restaurant a little lower at about 3.5 or 4 stars. The bar is amazing. There is good live piano music and the cocktails are so good - might even be my favorite place for drinks in Scottsdale. Not only are the cocktails great, but the wine list is super extensive and you cannot go wrong with almost any choice.  It frustrates me when people review restaurant on yelp based on the drinks, so I want to clarify that Ocean Club not only has 5 star drinks it has 5 star food. The oysters are probably my favorite in all of Arizona, they are cleaned very well and always fresh, and how can you go wrong when they are accompanied by pretzel bread and garlic toasts!? The salads are also nice to have as well as the shrimp cocktail (they are more like little lobsters). The best thing on the menu thought? The Mac and cheese!!!   You can't go wrong spending a Saturday night with a drink and some light food at the bar at Ocean Club.   My only warning: it is an older crowd. So if that is something that turns you off, it might not be for you.

Most disappointing meal I've ever had, and I'm not sure which was worse - the food or the service.   We decided this would be a fun place to try for a birthday. We wanted to do the tasting menu and eagerly picked the 5 courses with wine pairings - we also ordered a single hot tea...this was around 6:30PM. At 7:30PM, I inquired about my tea. It was brought out quickly after my request, but I was never given a refill or asked if I wanted one - in the 3 hours we were waiting for food. Moving on...  First course: Around 7:45 our first course showed up without our wine pairing. After waiting and asking for our wine, it came after we finished our first course. I had ordered the crab panna cotta for this course. It was absolutely disgusting. It was as if someone took wonderful pieces of crab meat and soaked them in sour cream to the point where they were inedible. I figured this just want my thing and the next course would be better so I didn't say anything, but I was wrong.   Second course: The next course was the worst of the night. It was a parsnip soup that the server described as cream based, but wasn't. Now, I love salt, I put it on everything, but this soup was too salty...I couldn't even eat it. I just left it on the table and it was taken away by someone there who didn't even inquire to how I liked it. She just took it away - not a word. I again figured that the main courses would be excellent so I didn't ask to speak to anyone about my meal and I waited.   Third course: Around 8:30 my first main course arrived - the filet. Wow, it was cold, covered in a sweet sauce and fatty. Again, I didn't eat my meal and it was taken away - no questions asked. My husband's first main course was the scallop. Somehow this was worse than the filet. It was as if someone took a single large scallop and minced it up and over cooked it. He didn't finish his tiny plate. Since nobody came by we didn't complain again, until our next course came out.   Course four: I ordered the hen and my husband the elk. The hen came out cold and pink. His elk, rare. We asked for both to be cooked to a medium and to come out warm. They both came back, burnt and somehow due to the long wait, cold.   We then complained about our meal and begged them to please not bring out the last course since we were starving and hadn't eaten. We were told they would be speaking with the chef, but nobody came back to talk to us until our check arrived. I couldn't believe that a $300 dinner could be so bad. We have had so many good experiences eating in Scottsdale for less that I truly can't believe this place is still open. I don't know what I was missing.   If you are looking for a restaurant for a special occasion don't come here! Want to find a restaurant at to break up with someone or complain about, this is the place!

This is the BEST sushi in town. HANDS DOWN. Not only is the fish is fresh, the wasabi is also fresh, AND it is BYOB. What more could you ask for!?  Our favorite dish there is consistently the fresh carpaccio on special, but everything is good. Also, if you like eel, then this is the place to get it prepared perfectly since it is hard to find good eel in Arizona most of the time.  Hana is a MUST try.

If I was reviewing only the sandwiches here I'd give them a 5 star review! The sandwiches here are the best. They make them with super fresh, the breads are great, and they simply put together great combinations of ingredients. You cannot go wrong with the sandwich option. The pastries are also fantastic! Everything from the scones to muffins are delicious!   Unfortunately, the breakfast burritos and coffee are just mediocre (ironic when it is called the coffee shop).  My recommendation is to come here for lunch. It is a wonderful spot for lunchtime!

If Cafe Nordstrom existed outside of the mall, I would eat here every single day!  Everything on the menu is AMAZING. My favorite entrees are the salads. I have never had a more difficult time choosing a salad. My favorite is the salmon salad, but they are all good! The soups are just as tasty. The tomato bisque is out f this world and the garlic crouton it comes with is just as delicious. Also, to finish it all off, if you have not had a magic bar they are a must try!  If you haven't eaten at Cafe Nordstrom, skip the food court and do yourself a favor and try it. You will not be disappointed, especially after a long day of shopping.

Sprinkles Cupcakes are hands down the best cupcakes around!   My favorite flavor has consistently been the red velvet, but as for trying new flavors the smores flavor and black & white are amazing too!   Just to comment on some great new additions to Sprinkles - they have a sugar free red velvet and mini cupcakes too!

Good idea for a date night, but not executed well. We went in with a Groupon for 2 wine tasting flights and an appetizer. We ordered a "fairytale brownie." I don't know if you have ever had these before, but they are AMAZING. However, at Su Vino they were absolutely disgusting! Even the waitress who saw us order it let us know it was OK if we wanted to order something else because they were the ones nobody wanted and they saved them up until someone ordered them. As far as the wine, it was a cute idea to have different wines to taste, but most of the selection was not very good. Needless to say, I won't be going back...

Hamachi Serrano and the Chirashi roll are outstanding! Also, recommend the mini burgers during happy hour. In general, the happy hour is excellent here and worth every penny.   We have dined here many times and each time has been great. However, the only issue we have had dining here is with the sashimi being cut poorly. Each piece was very tough and we couldn't even chew them. Otherwise, everything has always been very good.   I highly recommend also taking their all you can eat sushi making class if you are looking for something fun to do!

We went here while staying at the Hyatt. We didn't expect much because it was just a restaurant in the hotel, but we were presently surprised.   I ordered the cheese board, Caesar salad, and the pasta special. The cheese board was fantastic. They cut everything fresh and have a wonderful selection. This was good enough to come back just for cheese & wine. The Caesar salad was also very good. It was very traditional Italian, which is hard to find. The pasta we really enjoyed. It was fresh with a nice sauce. The service here was also great!  After eating here they also give you passes for the gondola ride, which is fun for after dinner!  We will be back again!

We went here for a holiday weekend while staying at the hotel. Thinking the food would have to be good for the extremely high price we went in with high expectations. The food was VERY mediocre at best. The scallops were cooked well, but over seasoned and the risotto they came with was gross. The salmon was overcooked and came with a vegetable side that ever more disgusting than the risotto which we could not finish. Needless to say we will not be going back...

Fogo De Chao deserves a solid 4 stars for my experiences there. However, the salad bar deserves like 5 or 6 stars - there is no better salad bar in town!  The meal comes in two phases: salad bar and meat like most Brazilian steakhouses. You get a little coaster type button that you put up on one color while you eat salad and another color while you eat meat. While this is happening you get side dishes and drinks. My favorite side dish is the bananas, AMAZING. When you are ready for the meat - meat carvers will come to your table to offer you various cuts and cooking temperatures. They have every kind of steak, plus lamb and chicken. The steak is very good here, but it is not the best I've had even in Arizona, hence the 4 star review instead of 5.   It is so hard not to over eat here, so I recommend coming hungry, and don't skip the amazing salad bar because you are looking forward to steak!

I can't say enough good things about Postino. As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best food overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I am giving 4 stars. I am giving it four stars only because for some reason every time I go here the food just doesn't seem as fresh as the other Postinos. Also, parking is a nightmare and you are literally forced to valet.   If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good.   Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic.   Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a try of bruschetta! It cannot be beat!!

I love the wine selection here! Sometimes there are even wine tasting events that are great!  The food is really solid too. I have tried most of the menu and have never had a bad dish. My all time favorite is the steak. My only complaint is that the bruschetta is solid, but I hesitate to call it really good since this doesn't really compare to Postinos.   5th & Wine is a really good spot for a big group, party, etc.!

Really cute place! We absolutely LOVED the fresh sangria. There are three different choices, each flavor better than the next. We were just stopping by for a snack since we had dinner reservations later in the evening, but were luckily able to try the black rice and stuffed peppers. Both were amazing. The black rice was better than any tapa we could even find in Spain, a must try for sure!! The staff was soo nice and helpful. We will definitely be back!

I went here with the expectation that it would like your run of the mill Vegas buffet, but I was wrong. It was sooo much worse. This place is definitely those looking for quantity over quality.   We went for "seafood night." This consists of badly tasting lobster claws, gross oysters, mediocre crab legs, etc. I was extremely disappointed in the seafood selection especially knowing that all of the other restaurants in this casino have amazing seafood.   All of the other food choices were mediocre at best.  The deserts were not very good either. Even though there was a big selection I couldn't find a single one I liked. Meanwhile, I was with a diabetic who only picked the "sugar free" options. ***WARNING*** they are NOT sugar free. His blood sugar spiked as soon as he left. A very scary thing to mislabel.   Overall, not an enjoyable experience and will not be back.

***This review is for the casino - not the hotel.***  We decided to gamble and the lowest black jack table is $10. Then we order drinks while sitting at the table and the waitress doesn't mention that the drinks have a fee. She comes back and wants $25 for 3 drinks! I have NEVER heard of a casino that charges you to drink while you gamble and doesn't even mention it when you order! Be careful!  Meanwhile, we tried to get takeout from Ocean Trail and they wouldn't let us. In order to get takeout they expected us to wait in the long line to be seated for food. We ended up not getting anything.   I can't believe the policies in place at this casino. The customer service is horrible!

I cannot say enough good things about Ocean Trail. My only complaint is that we didn't discover it sooner! If you like spice and you like seafood, you cannot go wrong here.   When you walk up to Ocean Trial the first time it is almost confusing and a little awkward as it is very small place and on the Casino floor directly behind everyone gambling. If you go on the weekends you will wait standing in a roped off line to the side, but it is worth the interesting atmosphere and the wait.  If you are not sure what to get, I must say that the pan roast is hands down the best dish ever, but the crab cocktail and the shrimp boil are also amazing. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. That being said, we did not enjoy the muscles. However, this would be the only thing on the entire menu I wouldn't recommend.  If you haven't been here before - try it! If you been here and weren't sure you fell in love - try the pan roast, and you will!

Orange Sky really has an incredible atmosphere. The view is 5+ stars. The food is more like 3.5-4 stars. We went here and made a reservation for a private booth to watch the sunset. It is so cool to do this. The view from the room is amazing and they open the curtains for you to watch the sunset in private. You can walk outside while you are waiting for your food to a really nice patio type area where you can bring your drinks and relax.   The food was really good overall, but  not what you'd expect from a restaurant so amazing in every other way. We ordered the filet, scallops, crab, oysters, and cheese plate. The filet and scallops were cooked perfectly, but both had a little too much seasoning for our taste. The crab was seasoned much better, but slightly overcooked. The oysters and cheese plate were both nice, but nothing exceptional. The desert was fantastic.   I would recommend Orange Sky to anyone looking for a special occasion place. The view really sets this place apart from any other restaurant in the area that I can think of.

I LOVE That's a Wrap. Not only is the food always good, the staff is super friendly and always make good recommendations if you don't know what to try. My favorite dish is the buffalo chicken wrap and the black bean soup, but I have not had anything I don't like!

This is my favorite thai food in Arizona. I have been here a dozen times, each time trying something new. I have not been let down yet. Of course, some Dishes stand out more than others. My favorites are:  1. Pad Thai 2. Yellow Curry 3. Eggplant Wrapped Chicken 4. Lemongrass Soup 5. Coconut Rice  You can't go wrong with any of the things listed above they are amazing. I recommend getting the coconut rice no matter what, it's awesome!!

The food here is outstanding. I've tried most everything on the menu, and I can't say enough good things about the scallops, steak, chopped salad, all of the salads really...  OH, and the drinks. AMAZING! One of the best places in town for a drink. Everything is fresh, real juice etc.  So why four stars? On the multiple times I've been to public house and on only about 1/2 of them has the service and wait time been good. The other 1/2 of the time the service has been extremely slow. This is especially annoying when you are getting take out or looking for a quick meal. Last time I went to public house I sat for 1.5 hours waiting for only a chopped salad. My friend who was with me waited just as long for her watermelon salad. In spite of the wait times and the service, Public House has wonderful food and is def. worth a try! However, I would not go if you are pressed for time.

We had heard that after the change of ownership that this improved greatly. We never tried it before, but thought we would give it a shot. We tried the continental breakfast and the mushroom spinach quiche. We were disappointed in both. The continental breakfast comes with a croissant that was too doughy and the crepe omelet was mediocre.  The quiche had good flavor, but was the dough was still raw which spoiled the taste. Hopefully, they get their act together over time because it is a very cute place with a lot of potential.

Amazing food, service and overall experience. It is hard to know what to expect when you arrive to a little spot with 5 seats. We did the pairing menu which was phenomenal. Everything was fresh and delicious. Don't think you can go wrong here for a casual evening of appetizers or special occasion tasting menu!

All I can say is YUM!!!   Went here for happy hour and the deviled egg dip appetizer is amazing! They also have an awesome drink selection.  Came back for lunch and then brunch and LOVED the crab cake eggs Benedict. Hands down the best eggs Benedict in Arizona. Also tried the brown bag chicken sandwich and it was solid too.  Never have had anything here that wasn't outstanding. Give it a try!

I used to love Butterfield's, but when Butters opened and I tried my loyalty switched...  Butters is my favorite breakfast place in Scottsdale. Not only have I not had anything bad on the menu, but they will make everything on their menu healthier. They will use egg white or Pam instead of butter upon request and they are really good about substituting potatoes or breads whereas a lot of other restraints are more difficult about these things or you don't know how something is being cooked. Aside from just being able to get a healthy breakfast, their scrambles are delicious! And if you are in the mood for a treat they have great pancakes and their bacon is probably the best I have had in the area. Also, the juices are fresh, the coffee is good and the coffee drinks are wonderful!   It is really hard to get a table at Butters over the weekend, so go at an off time if you can to try it!

I don't think I've ever had a better meal in all of Arizona. If there were 10 stars, ShinBay would get them all. MMM.  We did the tasting menu. The starter was a halibut sashimi in a ponzu like sauce. Typically, you wouldn't think of halibut as being the go to sashimi, but it was prepared perfectly and can't think of a better sashimi dish. The next course was a bento box with different small apps. Each one was better than the last. We especially enjoyed the oyster and uni. The third dish was a mushroom soup. It was phenomenal! The fourth dish was a "cook your own" wagyu. At first we were hesitant to do this, but once we realized how amazing this meat was we couldn't get enough. The final dish (and surprisingly the best) was a plate of nigiri. Every piece was perfectly done and SO fresh. This was the best nigiri we have found anywhere in AZ. For desert we had a custard with fruit that was the perfect ending to the tasting.   Overall, the prices are very high, but extremely worth it. Alcohol prices are reasonable. This is a truly perfect spot for any special occasion!

I don't think I've ever eaten at a worse sushi restaurant than this.   We decided to sit outside as it was a nice day, but all of the plates were dirty on the table. We thought maybe it had something to do with sitting outside and the wind and asked for new plates and were brought a second set of dirty dishes.   Then we ordered a selection of the cucumber rolls (the ones that use cucumber on the outside instead of seaweed). What a mistake! I mean, you can really taste the fish when their is no rice. The tuna was so awful and I am not sure how to describe it. It wasn't super fishy it just had this taste like it had gone bad. I am getting upset just thinking about it.  Finally, the very worst part was the service. In a 2+ hour period we were maybe able to get a drink refill once and never able to order or get the check in a timely manner.   I have no idea how this place is still open. Don't eat here.

BEST GELATO IN ARIZONA! They have so many good flavors and the quality is great! They even have a couple of dietetic flavors which are very tasty as well.   Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

I tried this place with my family thinking it would be like YCs. Boy was I wrong!  I have three major complaints: 1. The meat is not from frozen like at YCs and sits out. This is so disgusting and could seriously make someone ill. What is even worse the whole place smells like fish and makes you nauseated just walking in.  2. The sauces are super thick and sugary. They overpower anything you put in your bowl and ruin your meal. The worst part is that there is no way around this because they are all the same consistency.  3. The fried rice is disgusting. Not only is it too salty, but it has no other flavor.  Needless to say, I will never return here.

I was really surprised to see that this placed had 4.5 stars, which was why we tried it. The food was not good and the fish did not even seem fresh. I would not recommend this to anyone. Don't be fooled by the reviews.

When you walk into this strip mall you may not expect much. However, this is the best spot in town for gyro, hands down. Regardless if you want a salad or a sandwich, the gyro meat is great! If you aren't a big fan of gyro, no problem. The chicken here is amazing as well!   My favorite meal is the greek salad with gyro meat, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.   The portions are huge, the quality is great, and the price is worth every penny!

This is the worst place to get coffee or breakfast before work...ever. Only come here if you want to be late to work and have them be out of everything.   The last three times I came here, I have the same story. Walk in, wait FOREVER in line because the only use one register, not two, wait EVEN LONGER for regular coffee, not a latte, just regular coffee.   What's worse than the wait is the way they wrap the sandwiches. They cut them in 1/2 but wrap them together. It never fails, you open your sandwich too quickly and 1/2 is on the ground. Have I mentioned that the breakfast sandwiches are like minimum of $6 also, and by the time you are done you are only eating a half, sooo the price is really like $12.  I'd also like to note, they had no Stevia or Splenda the last two times I was in. I had to go to Dunkin donuts next door to even get that.   If this review sounds like I'm upset - I am! Won't be back again. Not worth it at all.

I can't say enough good things about Postino. As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best food overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of ingredients).   If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good.   Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic.   Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a tray of bruschetta! It cannot be beat!!

I recently went to SOL for happy hour. The items on the menu sound excellent, but none of them were very good. I tried both shrimp items on the happy hour menu. The shrimp cocktail and the pan seared shrimp. They give you nothing to peel the pan seared shrimp with and they are burning hot when you get them. However, the flavor was good. As for the shrimp cocktail the taste is very bitter and it was watery.   The salsa and guacamole were nice, but I wouldn't go back unless it was just for drinks and chips.

Yum!!! The Lobster Lady is the BEST!   She gives you a HUGE portion of fresh tasty lobster! The lobster rolls are my favorite, but even the lobster salad was wonderful!   The other things on the menu are good too! My favorite of which are the fried clams.   I am definitely going to be following the Lobster Lady around this year until she leaves!

After hearing about Searsucker in San Diego with Top Chef's Brian Malarkey we couldn't wait to try Searsucker when it opened here in Arizona. We saw a Groupon and decided to try it right away. If you haven't been, it is in an odd location in the edge of the mall. You have to mark at Neman Marcus or pay $5 to valet. In our opinion, if you don't have a parking lot for your restaurant, you shouldn't charge for valet, or at least validate. Also, I must admit the statues of animals out front are not our taste, but that didn't stop us from being opened minded about the food.   That being said, the first thing we tried was the cheese bread they give you before you order. We thought it was overly spicy and not very good. We hoped the tapas would be better.  We decided to go with a few different tapas. We tried: 1. Meatballs - These were the best thing we tried. They are homemade meatballs in a tomato basil sauce. They are very nice, but they only give you 5 small meatballs in an order. 2. Tuna Poke - This wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good. It also wasn't tuna poke. It was more  like a tuna tartare that looked like cat food. It wasn't fishy or anything seriously wrong with it, but there was nothing that stood out about it either. I've had it better at many other places.  3. Duck Fat Fries - These were very heavy and not very good. You could taste the duck fat and it was overwhelming. We've had these at other places and enjoyed them much better. The tomato jam that came with it was sort of pretentious and not very enjoyable. I would have rather had ketchup. 4. Cobb Salad - This was by far the worst thing we ordered. The dressing was some sort of cross between ranch and blue cheese and was super watery. Gross. The bacon came in the biggest pieces I've ever seen and basically took over the whole salad. The avocado wasn't fresh and it just left much to be desired. I could have had a better cobb salad from the Cheesecake Factory.  5. Scallop - The scallop was cooked perfect, but the sauce was too sweet and overwhelmed the taste of the scallop. If you like that sweet asian sauce on your scallops, then this was good, but it was too much for us.   I'd say the food here was very average at best. The reason I didn't not give Searsucker 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the prices. Everything is extremely expensive and for it just being OK, it is just not worth it. We won't be back to give it another try.

We really enjoyed our meals here. Almost everything was great. The place is super cute inside and is much bigger than it appears when you walk in.  We started with the mussels appetizer which blew me away. This is the first place that I have been to in Arizona that can actually make decent mussels and these weren't just decent - they were awesome! For the entrees we tried the lamb and the scallops. Both were great. The only comment I can make is that the lamb was out of this world, but the scallops were just "solid." Also, the cream of mushroom soup was pretty bland so that is the only thing I would recommend skipping.   This is truly a great neighborhood place and I can't believe I waited so long to try it. I will be back soon!

Decided to try Abe's for breakfast. After reading all of the wonderful Yelp reviews I figured how could we go wrong!? Well, I don't know what everyone else ate, but we went very wrong.   I ordered the nova, eggs, and onion for breakfast as did my dad. We get this all the time everywhere we go and never have I had "fishy" lox. It smelled so bad I was afraid to try it and when I did I realized that it tasted just as bad. I could not finished it and exchanged it for egg whites made without butter and bacon. The egg whites came soaked in butter with bacon that had a weird "irony" taste. My dad felt the same way about his food.   After all of this the waitress felt bad and brought a brownie for me to take home, but honestly after I ordered egg whites I couldn't eat due to being smothered in butter, the last thing I wanted was a brownie...  I would never ever recommend this place to anyone, especially when Butterfields is down the street.

I thought I'd try this place again, but that was a bad decision! My salad had watery brown lettuce, brown watery guacamole and was honestly just gross. It is over $10 for a salad here and that is crazy to me since its neighbors are Gadzooks and Chipotle where I can get 4-5* quality for at least a couple of dollars less.

This shop has the best customer service out of any place like it in Scottsdale!  I have gone here a few times for watch battery replacements and they go above and beyond every time. They have very reasonable prices and work hard to make sure every customer is happy every visit.  I will definitely be returning for all of my jewelry or watch needs in the future!

We were in the mood for this type of food and based on reviews we decided to try this spot. When we pulled up we realized it was owned by the same people who own Mozarts (which I like), but the food here wasn't comparable.  Based on the cashier's recommendations, we tried the chicken schwarma pita and the plate version. We also ordered a side of fries. As soon as we got home and opened up our meal we realized the fries were raw potatoes soaked in oil which we ended up throwing away. How do you screw up fries!? The schwarma was even worse. The chicken was super greasy, over cooked and not very tasty. The plate came with no veggies and was literally an expensive pile of meat.   The meal was very disappointing!

This was the worst foodie experience I have ever had in Vegas. There is amazing food everywhere you turn in Vegas, except here.   First of all, the food is so bad. I can't believe Ramsay would even want his name associated with this restaurant. We tried multiple dishes on the menu including the caesar salad, beef pie, scallops, and lamb. The caesar salad had overly fishy, bad tasting anchovies which you could barely taste under the dressing the salad was drenched in. The beef pie was not only much too salty, but too peppery as well. The scallops must not have been cleaned because eating them was like eating a handful of sand on the beach. They were also in a chowder type broth that was mostly potatoes with no flavor. The lamb was nothing special and irony tasting. We enjoyed nothing except our cocktails, which by the way were excellent. Guess this is the place to only grab a drink. I would expect food like this at Denny's, but not at an extremely high priced restaurant with Ramsay's name attached to it.   The best part if the story is that this awful foodie experience took place on a night that Ramsay was actually visiting the restaurant, but he clearly wasn't watching what was going on in the kitchen and was preoccupied by fans. If we couldn't have a somewhat decent meal with him there I would sure be afraid to try this place when he isnt there.   This really should be his next stop on Kitchen Nightmares.

Yonaka is amazing! They take ordinary sushi and make it something special.  Everything we tried on the menu was great. We especially enjoyed the salmon prepared various ways and the sake selection.  If you are a visitor, take the time to head off the strip a bit to try this place and if you are a local, why haven't you been here yet!?

EW. That about captures it.   We were so excited to see a new Fox Restaurant Concept open up in town. Also, we are HUGE oyster and seafood fans and that's why we were so curious about this restaurant -- especially when they have a huge oyster area up front and state they ship the oysters in fresh every day. However, there is NO WAY these oysters were fresh. They had a mushy/creamy consistency that made it impossible to want to finish them.   We also tried the shrimp cocktail and jar of crab appetizers. Neither one of these were disgusting, but they weren't good. The shrimp cocktail from Costco is much better than this one was and cheaper. The crab was over cooked and extremely pricey for the quality and amount you receive.   This place is expensive to try and not worth it. My advice is skip Little Cleo's and try a different Fox Restaurant Concept instead.

The Butterfly Wonderland is SUCH a cute idea. I can't believe someone hadn't already thought of it and opened it. You go in and there is a cute small museum for butterflies and a gift shop, this is followed by a 3D education movie (great for children) on the Monarch and then you go into the "butterfly wonderland" where you walk along   a little path where the butterflies flutter all around you and land on you. You can take pictures and it is def. great for kids. Overall, it is such an adorable place.   However, I gave it four stars because the prices are high for what it is. This may be because it is new and eventually they will come down. Adults are around $18 dollars each while kids are about 1/2 of that.

Solid burgers and fries! Love that they give you the options to mix and match the type of protein with the different topping options.   The only downside is the price. They are pretty expensive for a burger, but definitely worth a try!

Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant, ever.   I ordered the Pho like noodle bowl off of their new menu and so did the person I was with. I ordered the version with scallops and prawns. We both ordered it "mild." I normally eat everything spicy, from my sushi to my mexican food, I eat anything as hot as can be. However, this was the spiciest thing I ever ate.  The other person I was with felt the same way about theirs. It was too spicy to swallow, let alone enjoy. This shouldn't have been a problem as I requested some more broth to water it down. It was still too spicy, so I requested to return it and order something else instead. This is when I realized I would never be returning to this establishment...   I was told that it was because I "CANNOT HANDLE SPICE" and that they would "NOT ACCEPT IT BACK." I was shocked. I have never heard of this happening at a restaurant. Isn't the customer always right? I asked to speak with a manager. I was told the manager doesn't speak English and I could not be helped further. I asked the waitress to speak with the manager in Thai. She said the manager would not take it back for something else after speaking with her. I said to return it anyhow then - I couldn't eat it.   THEN, the waitress brought it to the back and came back to tell me that the manager had said I was trying to take advantage of them since I had eaten 2 of 5 scallops placed in the bowl. This is A) the craziest thing I have ever been accused of B) who cares since they wouldn't take it back anyhow C) the pettiest thing you could ever say to someone at a restaurant (I cannot believe she actually counted them) and D) a bold faced lie as she actually exaggerated the number of scallops included (there were only 4).   I don't care if this place had the best food in the world (it doesn't), I WILL NEVER RETURN!

Really happy the Gladly is now open for lunch! It is nice to have a version of Citizen opened on the other end of Camelback.  Their menu is very different than Public House, but they keep the same ideas and of course they kept the classic chop salad, which is my all time favorite.   The food here is really good - I have yet to try some of the interesting dishes on the menu, but can't wait!

I just discovered this gem and I will be back soon!   First and most importantly, the coffee is great and so are the lattes!   Second, I have never met a nicer staff at a coffee place. They are super friendly and accommodating to all of their customers needs. We wanted to take pictures there and they had no problem with it and even helped us out. They really go above and beyond.   Third, it is right on the water and it is so beautiful and relaxing to sit outside here and drink coffee. They inside is decorated perfectly and is just adorable.  Finally, not only do they have coffee, but they do wine and cheese. What more can you ask for!?

This store has such cute items and the prices are fairly reasonable - especially for Scottsdale!  We found some really nice furniture here that was unique. The best part though is how accommodating they are with delivery times and how quick they are to deliver large items.  We will definitely return!

Awesome concept, awesome meal. The review may raise to 5 stars if I were to try different pasty options, but this review was for the ones we tried. We had the shepards pie and greek pasties, both were good, but others looked like they were much better. The smashed peas and fries were also awesome.   I highly recommend this restaurant!

***This review is for the breakfast bar.***  I've been thinking about going in for awhile now and I am so glad that I did! This place is adorable. It looks like a library meets a hotel lobby. It definitely could be a wonderful place to work from home or for a business meeting.   As for the food, I tried the egg sandwich and the salted carmel sticky bun. OMG the salted carmel sticky bun was out of this world and it was especially nice because it wasn't too heavy like a normal cinnamon bun. It was thinner and lighter. The egg sandwich was solid and enjoyable.  The only downside (which wasn't big) is that the coffee is just so-so and they only have one option to choose from, but that could change since they are new.  Overall a great experience and I will definitely be returning!

We went here during restaurant week. Upon entering we were very impressed by the atmosphere and the live jazz music playing. We went with the restaurant week set menu, which included two apps and an entree. We also got the drink pairings.   The appetizers we tried were the octopus, a ravioli, a meat pasta, and a salad. All of these were amazing!! The best of which were the salad and meat pasta. We would definitely get both of these again. For the entrees we had the steak and salmon. The salmon was cooked a perfect medium as was the steak. The only negative comment is that the steak had a little bit of an irony flavor, but that just might be the cut of steak it was.   The drink pairings were all incredible and a good match for the food. The portion sizes are on the smaller size, which was nice to try lots of different dishes.   We will definitely be back here again soon!

I really wanted to like this place. I mean it is super cute and we need another breakfast place in the area. That being said, the coffee is awful. Coffee is the most important item at any breakfast place and their's tastes dreadful. My second complaint was the food. Don't get me wrong - it wasn't disgusting or anything, but I can make better breakfast at home so why should I go there to pay their crazy high prices for breakfast? It just isn't worth the price.

Cute concept, but very mediocre. We went into this restaurant hoping to find some good mexican food in Gilbert, but were disappointed by the food. We ordered the fish taco, clam chowder, and oyster. The clam chowder and oyster were both below average. The oyster was warm and sort of gross. The clams in the chowder were chewy. The fish taco was average at best. Hard to justify eating here when Joyride is right across the street...

I really wish I could give 0 stars.   I came in here expecting a quick, easy lunch, but this was far from it. I ordered a salad of the menu, but boy was that a mistake. After I ordered, I patiently waited for 20 minutes, during which time I watch the salad girl make the two slowest salads I've ever seen made. It literally took her 10 minutes per salad. While I watched in disbelief, I observed not a single cook or line person, including what appeared to be the manager wearing gloves. Horrifying. However, I figured the salad girl was using tongs at least so I continued to wait. Then, it happened. She fumbled and dropped a bowl. I watched her pick everything up off the ground and he proceed to put dropped ingredients into my salad that I had waited close to a half hour for at this point.  I no longer wanted my food or food poisoning after seeing this. I desperately tried to get someone's attention to cancel my order, but couldn't and actually had to leave with no food and out my money!!!  I will never ever be back.

I can't say enough good things about Postino. As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best food overall followed by Postino Arcadia, Postino Kierland and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of ingredients).   This location is special because it has an upstairs and downstairs, which I love. However, they had some issues when we were there with running the food/drink upstairs. Hopefully they will work those out soon.   If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good.   Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic.   Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a tray of bruschetta! It cannot be beat!!
