This is a rip off right now. Online shows $22 rate, they sneak in a gps fee, and add small range balls your rate ends up being $37 with the worst greens in the valley. You can play far better high end courses for cheaper in the summer. Stay away.  The only way to describe this course is that it is Over Designed

Been going to Yoli's since it opened..Love it!  I have been told by friends that they have the best hamburgers, so I finally broke down (since I'm not much of a burger guy) and tried one with skepticism.  I now think they need to change their name from Yoli's to YUMMY'S Cafe! Holy cow (no pun intended) it was Awesome! Has to be the juiciest most flaverful burger I can remember eating. Not sure I can order anything else now.

for the first few years this place did an awesome job cleaning all of my vehicles. However about 2 years ago something changed and they started understaffing, under stocking the lobby and the entire staff became lazy....why did I come back again!? I must've forgotten. stay away unless you are desperate.  such a shame

Huge gym, with every type of equipment you can imagine and multiple of each. Tons of free weights so you never have to wait for anything. Never crowded and has a full size pool, hot tub, sauna and steam room. Best price in town from what I found. Not to mention the equipment is in awesome condition and when something breaks, they fix it right away, unlike most other gyms I have had memberships at.
