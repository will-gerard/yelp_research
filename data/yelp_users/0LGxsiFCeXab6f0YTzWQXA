Happened to stop by for a late lunch right as happy hour started. Service was great, both our server Beau and the mgr were very friendly and attentive. We got free wings courtesy of previous reviewer Nicole and they were cooked perfectly and had great flavor. I also had the market burger which is delicious and my girlfriend had the wedge salad. Very happy that we finally stopped by this local spot. We will be back again soon!

St. Patty's day and totally dead in here which is why we stopped by. Figured it would be easy to grab a quick bite and a green beer. We were so totally wrong! The waitress in the bar area looked at us at least three times and never came over, yet she had time to put on lip gloss and check herself out in the mirror. 10 min go by and I finally just walk up to the bar to order beers. Quick and easy to get from the bartender. We sit and sip our beers and another ten minutes later the waitress stops by to see if we want any food. We say yes we are ready to order and she goes to drop off some dishes and makes no rush to return. We finally order some simple chicken skewers and wait, and wait, and wait... 38 min exactly and after watching several other food orders come out and the cooks visibly not making anything in the kitchen, we finally walk out. Never coming here again. Service is appalling!!!

Was not at all what I expected, but in a good way for sure. Super light and almost fluffy, if you can say that about shaved ice. Got the taro with almond cookie and black sesame glaze. Very good and a cool vibe in this tiny little joint that was packed on a Saturday evening.

I found my new sushi spot in central PHX. Great service and location near the light rail. Had the gyoza for an appetizer which was good. Ordered the albacore nigiri and a crab mania roll which were both delicious and all the rice is purple!!! Don't let it freak you out as texture and flavor are great.
