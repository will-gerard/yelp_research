I went to Ritos expecting that I would love it, I have other friends that swear by this place and we have pretty similar taste. They had been telling me for months to go try out Ritos, so one afternoon I finally dragged myself over there. I went between 11 -  12 and there was no line and just a few people outside, I ordered a burrito aaaaand MEH. I don't get it, it wasn't a very good burrito. It wasn't bad or anything, but I didn't really enjoy it and almost didn't want to finish it. I told my friends this and they disowned and vowed to never talk to me again. I decided I better try to save my friendships and make sure my taste buds didn't die or something so I went to Carolinas the next day and their food was amazing as usual. So apparently something is wrong with me because I don't think Ritos is the greatest ever and now my friends won't ever talk to me again. I might go back to try Ritos again someday, but only because I value my friendships...

This is a awesome coffee shop in downtown Mesa! Great place to grab a cup of coffee and hang out. They have a awesome patio and good stuff to munch on if you are hungry. Staff has always been quick, friendly, and very welcoming. I'd recommend checking them out!

mmm vegan fast food or I guess comfort food. :) Lots of great choices here, love the crab puffs, and the Thai noodle bowl. Service is always fast and friendly and the decor is artsy. Very cool place to hang out and eat.

I've been to Ticoz many times for lunch and they never disappoint. My favorites are their brunch with the 1 dollar drinks and a huge breakfast burrito or their enchiladas. So tasty! Their chef Holly is very friendly and all the staff are awesome.

Great food and coffee! My favorite is just the good old fashion veggie burger. This is a good place to study, but kind of awkwardly quiet if you want to meet someone for lunch. I usually try to find a spot outside to avoid the quiet awkward conversation.

Awesome produce, all local and organic. Just bought a bunch of stuff and it was some of the tastiest veggies I've had.  Other nice local goodies to be found here as well. Everything I've tried has been delicious.  It's not too pleasant to visit during the summer since it is outdoors, so I just quickly get what I want and then run away to the A/C. Its nice to spend some time there and browse when it is cooler out though. I highly recommend checking it out.

I have two Volkswagen Golf TDIs that I own and love and trust Steven (the owner) of Independent Auto to always do top notch work on.   I've taken both my cars there many times over the past few years. Most recently when I hit a rock and busted open the oil pan I towed my car to IAS and they had it fixed in less than a day with a new oil pan and a new aluminum skid plate to protect my car from future evil rocks. I've also had my car towed there when it started overheating on the freeway, and they had it fixed up in no time with a new fan. Other work I've had them do is replace timing belts, water pumps, brakes, and probably other things that I don't remember right now. The point is that I'd trust them to fix anything on my VWs and know that it will be done right. I also give them kudos for always being easy to get a hold of. Some shops never answer the phone or call back and that is beyond frustrating.

This is my favorite Middle Eastern Restaurant in Tempe. I'm so happy they reopened in their new location! My favorites are the Chicken Tikka, Veggie Sunbusek, and the soup. If you've never had Sahara lentil soup you need to go there now! It is to die for.  The owner is always super friendly as is everyone else that works there. I highly recommend anyone to check this place out.

Cartel has ruined me for all other coffee, this is best coffee I've ever had. Sometimes it can take a while waiting in line, but its always worth it and the staff is always very friendly.

Went to the Breadfruit for lunch today and am sad I've never been here before! It was so delicious! My both my meal and my wife's was to die for. The atmosphere is also really nice with some good reggae playing and the service was excellent.  I will definitely be going back for more.
