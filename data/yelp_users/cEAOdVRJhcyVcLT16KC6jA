I always considered myself a promoter of this wonderful establishment. Until that fateful day last week...  It all started with me making the always difficult decision "what do I want for lunch?" I discussed it with my work friends who would be joining me in 30 minutes when their lunch break was scheduled. I zipped on over to get my smash on, I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich on white, buffalo rub fries, (with extra ranch of course!) and the Oreo shake. I sat down and waited for my food, after about 20 minutes and being patient (I noticed they had a huge on line order) I inquired about my food and when I would be receiving it because I had to go back to work. The response I got was "ok".   My friends arrived after I had waited 45 minutes! Still no food! I asked them to bring me my food back to work. They did, but I was given the grilled chicken sandwich on wheat... And I only got 1 thing of ranch!   So basically I waited way too long for my food and left the building with out even receiving my food! Then had to eat the WRONG food cold after my friends were able to bring it to me. It's fine that they were busy, I just wish they would have communicated that to me so that I could have chosen to go somewhere else on that day and returned to smash burger on another occasion. Now, I don't want to go there at all, if they ask why I might just say "ok"

We have been waiting forever for this place to be in AZ!!! So happy it's here! Buttery goodness in a bun the holds it all together (it's still attached in the back). Jared (manager) was so awesome! Not only is the food bomb.com but the service on a crazy opening day was amazing!   Everyone was making sure that we were satisfied with our food and that everything was right. Felt like I was at an Apple store. They got the details right from the food to the actual location. Simple, elegant, and delicious both to be taken by mouth and visually.   Love this place!!! We will be making the drive from Mesa more often now. This was the only real pregnancy craving my wife had, she is more than satisfied! I just hope they open up a location in the east valley!  Thanks again Jared!

Go here!!! You will not be disappointed! Simple menu that supports local businesses. So good and delicious. You get what you pay for in life. There are things in life worth paying extra for: a good pair of jeans, Apple products, high-thread count bed sheets!   These sandwiches are of the highest thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets of the food world. Well worth the extra $2 in comparison to other sandwich shops. I'd pay double for that Cuban sandwich any day!   Plus you can get a free bottle of water. That might change, but for now, it's the cherry on top.  PLUS! (Yes, there's even more) the people there are so nice and inviting and chill. You feel like they are your best friends when you walk in. Super cool people!  Feel good about what you eat by supporting a downtown Mesa restaurant. They use a local baker and just help improve Mesa.
