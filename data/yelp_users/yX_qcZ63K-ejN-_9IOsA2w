Picture the Fonze, Richie C, Ralph Malph and Potsy eating one of the best burgers in Mesa -- better than 5 Guys, better than In and Out -- equal to Giant Burger -- and that is Lenny's Burger. And it's inexpensive. And it's like a 50's diner inside. Unfortunately it's like a deserted shopping center on the outside. Top notch onion rings too.

Truthfully -- I have been here not once, not twice, but THRICE and my noodles were  always a little funky and dry. "Pete, why are you continuing to eat there if the food is marginal and the service average at best?" you ask. I'll tell you. Where else in the whole state of Arizona can you watch a man make noodles (Chinese or otherwise) RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE!!! I support that kind of dining experience. Noodle on China Magic Noodle House!   On another note, those complimentary boiled peanuts and pickled daikon are gonna give you some wicked breath. I say avoid that and pray your food comes fast.

Broken sound system, dirty, $2 to get a wrist band for re-entry, dead crowd every time, BUT -- where else can local bands play?

Backyard Taco is simply the best taco in town. The crazy potato -- crazy good. Great service, great atmosphere. I go often.
