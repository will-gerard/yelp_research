I have coming to Global Chiropractic and receiving adjustment from Dr. Steve for over 5 years now.  I have scoliosis and he has helped to keep me pain free and moving with more ease.  The office is a positive environment, Dr. Steve is always enthusiastic and you can tell that he loves what he does.  I think that is an important part of finding a doctor that you can trust.  I always thought chiropractors just work on your spine, but Dr. Steve has helped me with my shoulders, hips, wrists and ankles.    I can't imagine the pain I would be in if it wasn't for Dr. Steve. I highly recommend him

Tried to go to dinner here. Was told there was a 30 minute wait, said that was fine, we will sit and wait in bar. Nope 30 mins wait for everything bar and restaurant! But lots of open seats in the bar..didn't matter. We left shaking our heads as did next 2 couples that walked in behind us. I think they need to rethink their seating policy.
