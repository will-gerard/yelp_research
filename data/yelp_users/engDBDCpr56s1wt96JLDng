This place is a blast for entertainment. You feel like you have crashed a greek wedding. I think the next time I go, I skip dinner and just have a drink in the bar. The food is overpriced, bland and it is so loud you cannot enjoy your company. If you come for dinner, you sit thru the band playing the same rifts over and over. I can only yell in my neighbors ear, so the rest of the table is forgotten. But for a rowdy group that just wants to drink and dance, this may be perfect!

Selected for a private party of 12, we enjoyed the Wine Room as a group for dinner and drinks on a Sat night.   The room was perfect- a square set up so everyone could be together and enjoy convo and share the al la carte sides. Our server, Chad, was super sweet and on top of it. Not a moment went by without our glasses filled or a finished plate cleared.   I had an amazing steak- of course- which I do not eat often because once you have it at a place like this, it is hard to imagine trying to duplicate. I put the creamed spinich on top and it was amazing. I also sampled the lobster mac and cheese which tempted me to lick the plate and also the lobster bisque. WOW. Seriously, everything knocked my pants off.  It seemed like all hands on deck kept the night smooth and us feeling taken care of. Outstanding service is so rare, and I must compliment the team there for being friendly- not snotty or unapproachable- and very attentive.   Perfect for a special nite out or a group in the private room.

I thought it might be odd to write a review about a spiritual spot...but sometimes I feel Macy's is my personal heaven so here goes.   For those of you looking to connect deeper with yourself and the world, and want a non committed affiliation, check this place out. Its not your typical church experience- the place is founded on Science of Mind which is NOTTTTTTTTTTT Scientology or even close. If you have seen The Secret, read books by Louise Hay, or hopped on the Power of Now wagon, you understand the basic teachings of The Law of Attraction and changing your thinking, changes your life.   Anyways, it is a perfect place to set aside an hour on Sunday to get back to basics. You can believe in any higher power and be cool here. The people are nice, don't corner you and the talk is always relate able to real life.  Wishing you all the best on your own journey!

I am pretty loyal to the dealership when it comes to my car, but on a whim and the desire to get a deal, I hit up Sun Devil for a oil change. I got the standard call with recommendations to get my hoses replaced and a transmission flush. Based on the summer coming up and my mileage, I went forward with the work. I picked up my car later that day and upon making a sharp turn, heard a crazy grinding noise. I went back first thing the next day, and they called to notify me that my power steering now needed to be fixed. I found this to be highly suspect. I asked how this seemed to pop up overnight and they stood firm on that as being fact.   I hauled ass back to get my car and take it to where I should have gone in the first place- the dealership. They popped my hood there, and I clearly saw where the power steering had been putting off some pressure. They took the car in to get a better look and discovered that there was also a splash guard hitting my wheel well that was actually making the grinding noise when I turned. This guard had not been replaced correctly after Sun Devil did work. The dealer also explained that the power steering issue could not have just occured in the 5 minutes after I left Sun Devil, as they claimed.  I was sharing my story with a girl at work , her car was still at Sun Devil getting re-fixed after she paid for over $500 of work and her car having major issues the day after she picked it up. I despise the feeling of being taken advantage of or treated like an idiot. I will never let anyone I know go to this place.

I had a pretend vacation nite here last weekend and loved it! Our room was newly renovated and overlooked the pool. The bed is super comfy, flat screen tv and the bathroom huge with a great shower.  The pool scene was great for people watching. We hung at the adult only section which was a huge plus. Pool was pretty busy and reminded me of spring break. Lots of locals for sure. I wanted a no-kid day and got it! Drinks were strong and service was available at the pool until about 6pm.   Every staff member was helpful and friendly. The grounds well kept and easy to navigate around. I will be back for another stay before summer ends!

I was eager to write this review, as I am hoping to use Yelp to share more POSITIVE experiences and opinions.   Last night I took my parents to John Henry's to celebrate my Mom's Birthday. This place came highly recommended from several friends of mine and people in the hospitality biz.   First and most importantly, the service was amazing. From being greeted, to seated and then cared for by the team during our meal, everything seemed perfectly timed and managed. It just does not happen like this any more. Little things like my water glass never going below half full- and I drink a ton of water!   We enjoyed the grilled salad, caprese, sea bass and lobster/crab ravioli and cheesecake. It was divine.   The ambiance to me is what makes a place. It has warmth, personality and a comfort that you cannot find elsewhere. Totally dug the live music!   My parents are the partying/lively type and would have been offended if I took them to an "old peoples" restaurant. It's not of the such. Sure its missing loud ass people, crying kids, servers bitching about personal life, cell phones ringing, dishing clanging in the back.... but it its place is personal service, great live music every day, comfy surroundings and damn good food. I hope you enjoy!

I have had this spot on my list to hit for over a year. My friend came into town from the Bay and I snagged her as my LoLo's date.   We hit the place for a late breakfast on a Sunday. When we entered, we were greeted like family. The service was personal and quick. I ate every bit of my two piece and waffle. My sweet tea was served in a big mason jar and it was perfect. When we left, I felt like family. Many thank yous and good byes from the owner and crew.   I am offically addicted! I am hoping now that my out of town date is gone, I can find someone else to soak up this amazing place.

The answer to so many of my wishes!!! Cute clothes for sizes 12 and up. What a freaking concept!!!!!!!!!  Seriously you would think this is not a far fetch, but it is. When I think of where to find something hot for a nite out or something sassy for play, this is the spot.  Good sales too!

I am the Director of Hotel Operations at a hotel in the Chandler area. I worked with this company to replace my cabanas at the pool. When they were done, I was called and realized that the sales person did not order the frames for the cabanas. I was very clear in my communication on what I needed. They are now charging me an additional $5,000 for their error. There was no follow up by the sales person when this error was realized. I have two other projects that I was going to use them for. There was no apology from the company and when informed I would not recommend them for the other two projects- they did not care in the least. Poor, horrible customer service. Will never use this company again or recommend to anyone.

I have just completed my volunteering here since I need to get a second job. SUCKS. I had the special opportunity to work in the barn with the horses, llama, goats and sheep. I loved coming there after work and enjoying the quiet of the campus and the views of the mountains while being outdoors with the animals.  They are currently looking for more volunteers, including my replacement for Wed evenings, and I would encourage anyone that loves animals to check it out! You can also foster, which for people who are home often, is a great option.  Wonderful people, cause and place! Please look for your next companion here before the pet stores or breeders.

So all this hype on hot waiters had this place on my list to do on my Stay-cation.   Sad to say, I was majorly disappointed!  A group of gals hit this place for a late lunch on a Friday. The server acted like he was bothered from the get-go. The service was slow and he was rude and cold.  The food was pretty good. I had meatballs and capellini. The sauce was one of the best I have had. My friends enjoyed pizza and a meatball sandwich.  I would possibly return for the good food. The service left something to be desired, especially a hot hospitable Italian man.

Damn you Joe! Please come closer to my hood. I love you so!!!!!!!!!!  I cannot really mess with a regular grocery store anymore. They have so many options for a single gal like me that does not want to slave in the kitchen. Oh and the pirates booty puffs are addictive. I really love the indian micro rice- I tell EVERYONE to get this stuff.

In need of a Spa Day, I choose the Phoenician Spa as a special pampering treat based on many recommendations and beautiful views of the mountain. A feeling of escape within my reach.  When I called to book, I was recommended the Desert Scrub, Wrap and Massage. I wanted to quench this dry winter skin. I added on a facial. I wanted the works.   It is so peaceful and welcoming here. The staff was very helpful and guided me through my day. I steamed and relaxed in the sitting area. Love the snacks!  My treatments were indulgent. I felt like a queen. I also liked that I did not have chatty therapists. The scrub and massage is a must! The facial was relaxing and informative. I was recommended some products without her being pushy.  Summertime I will be back! I want to experience the pool as well as some energy work. Ladies in the lockerroom raved about it.

Gawdddd I love this place. First, the service is outstanding. They treat you like a true guest. Second, the food is fresh and delicious. I'm obsessed with the breakfast roll with meat and cheese and the turkey sandwhich with with melted cheese, red onion, tomato and special spread rocks my world. I love buying special goodies here too like avacado oil and soup starters. I am so grateful for delivery for my Netflix binge days when I need real sustenance and delicious treats.

I am faithful and loyal. Simply give me personal service and a good deal, and I am yours forever.  The fact that someone answers the phone when you call is a gift in itself. Airline travel is never going to be perfect or seamless, but I am inspired by this company who keeps a friendly attitude for the most part and a good sense of humor.   I do get a good laugh out of the A/B/C lines and people camping out to make sure they get on first. I was thrilled to hear about the change in boarding and that now, people with kids have to actually suffer with the rest of us.  Now if only JetBlue would make a direct flight to the Bay... there would be a strong competitor for my cheap ass!

Oh Joy! It can be found on the top of Camelback Mountain at this Resort.  It feels like you are at some famous persons private retreat home. My spa treatment was delightful. The spa attendant was one of the most friendly women I have met. After my relaxing massage I sat poolside for a munchie.  My only complaint is sharing it with uppity snobs who have no regard for anyone but themselves.  Check it out on a weekday during off season!

Holy Cow. The most amazing meatballs ever. I don't know what is in them but I CRAVE them.   This place feels like home with friendly service and amazing food. The portions are big enough to split. Lunch will be offered soon and I will be adding an additional time of day to snag some Italian perfection on a plate.  I love that it is family owned by an Italian couple with so much personality and hospitality.

I love my dog more than most people love their kids. I am not one of those dress my pooch up and tongue kiss them type of gals but I do like to pamper my pet.   Marley has been hittin Bark N Babies for a just over a year now and he has never looked better! He gets groomed and his cut and shampoo look great weeks later. The staff is always happy to see him and even let him hang in the daycare area after his cut from time to time. They have boarding, grooming and daycare available. Pricing is in line with other groomers.  I am happy to recommend them to pet lovers valley wide!

I could almost walk to Fashion Square but prefer my dependable Fiesta!  I enjoy that this place is never a hassle. Parking is easy, unlike Scottsdale or Chandler where half the battle is even finding A spot, let alone a close one. Since I am a curvy girl, I am fortunate to find Torrid, Lane Bryant and Macy's all in one spot. The Macy's there has a good selection of cute clothes in 14 and up and the staff is always helpful. The shoe selection is minimal at this Macy's but the mall has other stores with cute affordable selections. Mesa does not have much to offer in the shopping world but this mall has always done me well!

I visited this place when it was Bada Boom and totally dug the space then. Now it seems even more perfect as a sports bar.  The space is laid out well and roomy. The bar is big and seems easy enough to get a drink. The booths are great! I am a sucker for a good booth- these are comfy and have own TV.  I had buffallo chicken and it was really good. It's nice to have bar food but not feel like your in some dumpy hole. Good spot for watching the game or hanging out with a big group.

Really love this place.... Great sushi, cocktails and decor. The staff is young but really helpful and fun. I enjoyed the Lobster specialty and it was amazing! I am now addicted to the lychee martini too. I shared the vegi tempura and it was the best I ever had.  This place is a perfect spot for a girls gathering or first date. The patio is small but great for people watching in Tempe Marketplace.  And of course there is something for the non sushi eater too!

I am glad we found this spot!  It was recommended from an Indian friend of ours and he is just about the most pickiest man alive. So we called them up and placed a big ass feast phone order. Service was great and helpful even though I cannot pronounce many of the menu items correctly.  Lots of vegi options and everything was really flavorful. The pricing is totally reasonable too. I have been back twice in 3 weeks.  I would recommend this place for great take out, a date night, lunch and more.

I was trying so damn hard to school these fools around here about PinkBerry/RedMango goodness and then bam- I happen to stumble in on Ice Tango.  It was like a force of nature that great day. I was searching for a place to hang before an appt and considered nearby Starbucks. But then, I see this place and ran inside screaming "Are you like Pinkberry!?!" The girls then gave me yummy samples and I was in heaven again.  My pic- the regular tangytart with carob chips and strawberries.  The next day I hit the north location after a day at the pool. My friend in tow, I turned her on to my discovery and FINALLY another Phx friend knew the pleasure I had been describing. I am thinking about pomegranate with pineapple right about now. Thank you Ice Tango!

I was introduced to this hidden spot by Jamaican friend who has been on a mission to discover great Caribbean food in Phx. It officially fills a void that has long been standing!  The decor and feel is classy but not stuffy. I can imagine going here on a date for sure. There are great booths on one side for a hidden rendezvous for cock-tailing.   I loved my dinner which was fish, rice and peas and green beans. It was flavorful and prepared perfect. My picky dinner companion raved about how much the food reminded her of home. Not one plantain was left on her plate.  Oh and my cocktail which was like a mojito but better was amazing! I would go back just for that drink.  Check it out! Its one of those rare gems that needs some support and the word spread.

As Director of Sales for Wild Horse Pass Hotel & Casino, I am happy to share my years of positive experiences with Myron and his team. The negative posts are reflective of past management and are quite dated.

Ladies Night Out! We have finally found our perfect place!  The Casablanca team welcomed the group of eight of us with amazing hospitality and service. The venue has comfy seating, beautiful patio space and a classy upscale vibe. As a member of the late 30's club, I enjoy a chill spot with seating, live music and the ability to get a drink with ease.   The band, Ear Candy, kept us dancing and grooving all night. I cannot wait to return!!

DVine creates amazing vip amenity gifts for my 9 to 5. Every guest who receives these goodies raves about the delicious snacks and treats. Plus the packaging is perfect! I tend to break in a couple for "quality control" and end up with week long cravings. This is truly one of those local gems that you are thrilled to have discovered.

Being the picky pet owner I am, I took time finding a groomer after my move to Chandler. Cage Free exceeded all expectations! They take great personal care of me and Marley, listen to my grooming desires and are prompt in letting me know when he is ready for pick up. I love that you can see all the "clients" happy faces. I highly recommend!

In searching for an ideal venue for a group celebration, I discovered many restaurants that were not eager for us to gather there. Not Salut! From my first call, the team was excited to assist with the special event, set aside a large area of the patio, and even called to confirm before the day.   Once we arrived, we enjoyed amazing food, attentive service and wonderful ambiance. The drink menu is creative and the bottomless mimosas are a must. I had an omelet with fresh veggies and breakfast potatoes that rocked.   The servers were on point- never missing an empty glass, offering to do split checks and comfy with fun banter.  I HIGHLY recommend this special place.

Bad. Bad. Bad. No service element at all. Bunch of staff standing around hanging out while my drinks sat waiting with the bartender. And booking a group at a lane before the day of is a joke. You have to sign a non refundable contract and lucky if someone actually assists you.

This is the real damn deal.  I felt like I was a true guest of a loving family. It was a dining experience.   Best pasta I have ever eaten. We shared the spinach ravioli and gnocchi. Good god. The pear salad was perfection.   I was serenaded in Italian for my birthday and treated to delicious tirimasu.  Looking forward to my next visit.
