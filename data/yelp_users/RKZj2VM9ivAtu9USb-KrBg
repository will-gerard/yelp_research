Been coming here for 13 years, consistently. Never once had any sort of issues with employees being rude, until today. Curly, the lifelong employee, had the audacity to rudely tell me to not bring $100 bills to pay for my food because it creates too much of a hassle for the employees. Last I checked, responsible businesses keep change in the safe for instances just like this (I know this because I run one). Instead of being kind and telling me to break my $100 bill elsewhere, he was a blatant dick. Sorry Cheba Hut, you won't be getting my cash anymore.

Top notch. Great beer selection, great wine selection, and the food is fantastic. The owners are incredibly friendly. I'll be coming here for years.

I am incredibly excited to have discovered this place. I've spent years searching the valley for what I considered to be "coastal state grade" sushi, and I believe I've found it. The quality of the fish  that is served in the sushi is incredible. It actually has some structural integrity!! For those of you who eat sushi, you know what I mean. This stuff isn't slimy at all. It is extremely fresh! They also have some pretty incredible beers available. I was stoked to find some awesome IPA's, and to find out that they frequently bring in new ones. Fellow hop-heads will sympathize with me on this. I highly recommend this place if you enjoy a nice, strong IPA and some quality sushi!

I came in here because I had seen how amazing all the Yelp reviews were, and now I am completely baffled. The best single word to describe this place is "Forgettable". The spicy tuna roll was so incredibly spicy (even for a native Arizonan) that I didn't even finish it, which has never happened to me with any meal in my life. The fish that was served was of a slimy consistency. The scallop roll was edible, but nothing to write home about. Every roll I ordered fell apart, usually before I had even touched it. The amount of 5 star reviews absolutely blows my mind. I will continue to take my business to the other end of the parking lot.

Horrible. Went in for 4 specific, extremely standard items and was only able to leave with one of them. Not to mention there were people waiting whose orders had been completely forgotten about. If the kid behind the register wasn't so worried about being witty, maybe he would've done a better job. Who knows. They should be much more prepared and stocked on a Saturday morning. Bosa it is!
