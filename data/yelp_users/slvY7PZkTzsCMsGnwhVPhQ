The hotel property was just right.  Super close to the airport and the price was right.  Stayed here for one night on 6/14. My friend had already checked in earlier than I did since my flight was coming in later that evening.  The property was clean,  the room was nice and comfy, the shuttle driver that evening was sooo very polite/nice/helpful &  the breakfast was perfect for our road trip up to Sedona. My huge complaint and the reason for a 2 star. I called a few days before my arrival asking about the airport shuttle: 1.) What do I do when I get into Phoenix Airport to notify I need a pick up? The clerk says just call when you get in and we'll pick you up 2.) Is there any fee? She said no "complementary for guest" but, tip is not included.  Okay great that's super easy.  I get in around 10pm and I did exactly what the clerk told me.  I called the front desk but,  at first no answer.  I called my girlfriend having to see if anyone is at the front desk and I call again then Sam, front desk answers.. I'm super happy someone picked up and I told him I need a shuttle pick up and I'm at Terminal 3. Now,  this is my first time here at Phoenix Airport.  Sam tells me I need to get my luggage and figure out how to get to Terminal 4, door 1. So Of Course I asked where is Terminal 4, I'm at Terminal 3. He said I have to ask and figure that part out. But, I'm sending my driver now over to Terminal 4, door 1. Ok,  I asked one of the airport workers if they could help me find Terminal 4. They told me it's about 20 minutes from here. I have to walk up to the 2nd floor, catch a Tran that'll take me to Terminal 4. Walk down this long hallway and I'll be at my destination.  I finally get to terminal 4, door 1 took me about 20-30minutes. I see the shuttle bus and wave him down,  I'm exhausted coming from a 6 hr flight,  my legs are tired,  and I'm happy to see the driver.  I apologized to him telling him so sorry I was at Terminal 3 and this is my first time here at the airport.  Sam told me to go to Terminal 4 and the driver was questioning why?  And I had no clue just thought it was the standard pick up area. The driver told me he could of picked me up at Terminal 3 and not have me walk/Tran this long.  So I checked in with Sam and we (the driver/I) asked Sam why didn't he have the pick up at Terminal 3. No remorse on his face,  no apologies only a straight face saying "well you friend called and said to have the shuttle pick you up at baggage claim" so I was in no mood in complaining super exhausted, it's about 11-11:15pm already,  and just wanted to crash, deal with this later. However,  when we woke up the next morning to have breakfast I did let the front desk know about my experience.  Now,  this is what should of took place prior to my Phone call 1.) They should of asked if this is my first time to the Phoenix area? If so,  they should of explained more details of where to go and they should of inquired more details of my flight to see what terminal I would be coming in 2.) Sam should of accommodate me as soon as I said "I'm at Terminal 3" and not make it difficult for me to go out of my way to accommodate him.  3.) Professionally Sam should of apologized to me and the driver for his inconsistency information 4.) Being that it was dark and late Sam should of at least escorted me to the building instead of having me tryna find my way in a dark alley... no lights to direct your path and kinda scary for females in an unknown area  Would I stay here again if ever travel back to Phoenix probably not

LnL drive inn??? Say what LnL's... Now for me back at home (Oahu) LnL is the last place you would find me checking in to a LnL drive inn... Too me this place is like a jack in the box, McDonald's and etc! We have so many local dive places to eat at that I always refuse to go unless it's the last resort!  But, since I'm here in Arizona finding something similar to what I'm normally accustom eating to is super duper hard to find. Even though places here offer teriyaki chicken, bbq meat and etc it's just not the same. All my friends n family says "Millie it's not home you just have to cook your own local food!" Okay, I've finally come to that realization but, there's a huge but in this.. Lol  This LnL is by far the closest place to having some kind of island flavor! Granted it's not exactly the same but, it's the closest too having some onolicous Mac salad, rice is on point, and their meals is just what I need to survive! lol and their always super nice!  It's nice looking at the menu and seeing laulau n Kalua pig combo, manapua, poke (it's not Poki it's spelt POKE), spam - Portuguese sausage- eggs & rice, curry katsu and etc! My happy spot in the happy valley area! Love love love this place! Thank you LnL for being here and having some island Flavors

My husband has been raving about this place to me since he moved here in Dec/January. He keeps saying "Hun, I gotta take you to this place when you move up here this soup they have is soooo delicious you'll love it!" Lol...   We finally get to experience this restaurant last night and my first exciting appetizer order is to try this amazing soup my husband keeps raving about "Gin tomato soup" now for some reason I thought it was gin as in ginger tomato soup it didn't even dawn on me that he was talking about gin as in the alcohol until after,  I'm sooo excited to taste this soup and I took my first bite and it was amazingly good with a big kick... I was like what's in here now cuz I don't taste the ginger my husband says "no it's not goner it's gin" lol... Duh' he had to help me finish it! But, it was very delicious!  Everyone in here were sooo pleasantly nice and funny! I love when the waiters are relax and just have some humor in them it really breaks up the monotonous environment of being in a restaurant and being funny/laughing is good for the soul! We had Patrick as our waiter and another gentleman he was hilarious to have around just loved his personality! Both Patrick and him are amazing people and they know what's best for a first time customer such as myself...   We had their balsamic steaks and my husband/I shared I can't eat a whole steak by myself and I hate left overs never tastes the same. But, the balsamic steak that Patrick suggested to us was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G we had it at medium and it has so many Flavors going through your taste buds as it is aged steak marinated! To me that's a yummy steak where you are able to taste so much Flavors!   The next favorite that Patrick suggested we get was the bread pudding and I'm so blessed we had him as our waiter the bread pudding was off the chain! Sooo yummy I want to go back and have another steak/bread pudding/wedge salad!   Much Aloha to you Patrick, the other server (sorry I forgot your name.) and everyone else in the restaurant for being sooo really nice and helping us with dinner suggestions!

Thank you to the Costco locations for flying in some onolicious poke from Honolulu! I am very very happy that you folks offer this to this state, Arizona! I am very happy with the choices that you bring in and now, I know I just have a taste of my home here in AZ.  It's delicious making POKE with a lot of things! We eat it at home by itself, on hot rice with some furikake sprinkled on, with your green salad just gotta mix your greens with your own dressing, add some avocados or whatever veggie you want & top it off with some poke on top or my favorite poke and some poi! But, poi is hard to find and if you do find poi it's the commercial poi (Taro brand).... Lol!  Kanak attack foa sure!!!!

We came here to meet up with family before leaving phoenix,  AZ to head back home to Hawaii.  This place is very quaint.  The food was good as well. I heard the Chorizos are very popular to try in Arizona & Las Vegas area so I wanted to try there chorizo wraps.   I ate it all. Lol!  It wasn't that bad at all.  There customer service was great too. Everyone was so nice and very helpful.    We also got a few more sandwich wraps for the plane ride home and that was sooo delicious.    Food is very tasty!  Perfect to hit the spot and comfortable

Hip hip hooray! Hip hip hooray!!!! Chheeehheeeee!! Being a native Hawaiian, lived in Hawaii all my life, and now recently moved to the desert/valley transition has been difficult as anyone that moves from their comfort zone it's difficult in the beginning! You try to find some kind of similarities back home and your friends/family say "you simply just can't and have to start learning how to eat differently!" A friend of mines who also says "Millie, you cannot find the same Korean bbq places anywhere in the states, get over it!" :-( :-( I refused to give up! Lol.. One day, at home I went on Yelp and I just thought I give it one more try and this time instead of typing in "Korean bbq" I typed "Meat Juhn" and low and behold - waaaaaahhhhhhh Paradise Hawaiian BBQ Plate Lunch pulls up! I was like no way, no freakin way, in Tempe! Seriously reading some of the reviews from the Hawaii peeps and Ohhh my gosh, We have struck Gold!! Lol...   Now, I just recently learned that Meat Juhn is a Hawaii dish, that's why there are no other Korean BBQ places that serve Meat Juhn! Hawaii is a unique places with many many different authentic flavors and food. I'm learning this as I'm living out of my comfort zone!   The owners are beautiful girls with beautiful hearts! Yes, they are strong spirited because well they've been doing this for a very long time. In fact, they used to own Kim Chee 5 in Kailua, Oahu and also on Ward avenue in Kakaakao when sports authority used to be Gems. How cool is that!!!!   I'm excitedly hauoli (happy) they are here! Sharing their mea aī (food/meals) with all of us near and far. You folks bring to me what I miss the most of home. It's the Flavors in each meat you cook. Not everyone will understand that unless you are from Hawaii.   Of course, I had my meat Juhn plate and it was onolicous, broke da mouth, no can move!!! Lol and the sauce for the Meat Juhn winnahz, winnahz! Some places back home only give you the aloha Shoyu brand with chopped green onions or Kikoman Shoyu (blaaahhhh can't stand Kikoman) but, Ohhh my gosh their meat Juhn sauce... Yummy!   You know you have a loyalty customer that will be by on a frequent bases! I am thrilled, excited, happy Yelp brought me to you folks!   A hui hou malama pono!

My husband had brought us here last week Friday but, it was a mad house. 45 minutes to wait for a table, hungry child, & still jet lag from the night before. We tried to order take out but, even that we couldn't get through. So we opt out of dinner and left. Today, however we came in early before the mad rush was seated promptly, they had some specials running which made it even more reasonable to dine in. Our server was on it, very alert, attended our needs even without asking, and he was soo polite. We eventually saw how the restaurant started picking up and getting busy. We were very happy to know we got in early, had great customer service, and the food was very very tasty!

It's been a week & 4 days overdue in my amazing experience, gratitude, sooo blessed for YELP reviews, and very happy I took my brand new car to Rick and his staff in doing an amazing job on my front windows and windshield!  I'm a 100% island girl moving to the Desert! I already felt a glimpse of the heat I can only imagine what it'll be like in less than 3 weeks when we're in the 3 digits. At first, I just wanted to tint the car darker so less light will come in and also tint the top of my windshield to try n block the sun (not sure if I can do that though in AZ) from hitting me while we are driving! But, Rick explained to us other options if that was my only concern was the heat & he gave us a few options and I love the most expensive options... Lol! Go figure, to reduce the heat from coming in (I forgot which one it's called) it's a little pricer so I only did the front windows/windshield and later if need be ill do the rest of my car!  I am sooo very very pleased and happy with my tint and how it can be a 100 degrees outside and it feels nice driving in the heat!!! Lol, we touch the window and it's hot well not that hot but, hot enough and we are okay... I don't feel like my skin is getting burnt around my eyes, arms, or legs when we do road trips!  I'm very Thankful for all the Yelp Reviews, Thank you RICK for taking your time in the many options you have, even though the option I chose was a little pricey it's totally worth every penny, it's the quality I love and mahalo for being sooo nice!

My son and I was driving all over Scottsdale/Paradise Valley looking for a dinning table to fit our apartment. My husband told us to go check out Living Space and so we did...  Upon arriving we were greeted immediately as we walked in, a gentleman graciously told us a little about what Living Space is all about which included their reasonable prices and it was funny because without mentioning to him of what are morning has been like he said something along the lines "you don't have to go driving around store to store looking for the best deals promise we have it here" lol! He then went on and showed us the way we're we needed to browse at their dinning selection. Then he left us alone which I was glad because I like to take my time looking & deciding without feeling pressured.  I saw one that I liked but, kept looking and Shawn came to greet us. Once I started speaking to him he automatically knew where I was from which was really nice to be recognized and knowing he was familiar with my home which was a huge plus.  I brought the dinning table and he said they could have it delivered to me tonight between 6pm - 12midnight for $99.00 I was super happy with that since my husband would of been the one having to put it together.  The delivery people came within that time frame tonight, they worked really fast, set up the table in our apartment super quickly and efficiently! Super hard workers and we totally appreciate there help. I was sad though knowing how many stops they had to do in one night, I do think living space should go easy on the deliveries/installation that's too much too ask for don't you think, living space? But, other than that all was great from the sales person to the delivery... Awesome and Mahalo!

I wish I could give this place a -0. Their is no hospitality or welcoming feeling as you step in through the doors it's as if you somehow ended up at a hospital for a split second! It's the first review I have to say that I was not impressed at all from being greeted from the 2 hostess standing around pretending to be busy and not even once cracking a real smile!  Well, onto our seats we were seated towards the back of the restaurant closest to the sushi bar. Nice ambiance with the decor I was happy to be here because I saw some of there photos with what I thought "Yes, real Japanese food!" I'm super hungry for some steak, baked mussels, and calamari! Boy, were we in for a rude awakening... Our waitress did not come to give us water, say hello for a good 10minutes. Within 10 minutes I knew exactly what we wanted before she came. When she did finally arrive to our table there was no introducing of her name "hi my name is ____ I'll be your waitress tonight would you like some water?!" Lol... Nope non of that tonight... It was "you ready foa yoa order what you like?" Lol and I of course had to stop her, look at her name tag and say "well, hello Cate how are you tonight? We're very excited you stopped by FINALLY & she totally dismissed my introduction of "hey breathe n greet us better!"  We normally would put our appetizers in first, then our salads, and last our main entree. But, because I knew the service was already slow I told my husband put in all the order that way it won't take as long! Sure enough even with placing everything in we still waited almost an hour to receive our food!  Their calamari is a sad looking joke! I know $4.00 what was we thinking totally not worth getting, then the baked mussels it looked like it was overcooked, shriveled, and no mayo sauce on it! On top of that our water service was pretty bad we had to literally wave her down to have her full our glasses of water every time and one time we asked for both glasses to be filled she only took one! SMH... Lol! The water also was not great I could taste the chlorine in it... Blllaahhh! I just asked for a glass of wine just to be safer! The only thing we liked was the teriyaki box with steak....  This was a one time only visit and never again!!!

I love my FISH, I love my sushis and ramen. Before moving here someone once told me "Don't eat any sushi places in Arizona it's not the same as in Hawaii!" Well ummmm I really really have to disagree with that person a total 100%‼ what in the world was he talking about... Never ever listen to that statement cuz it's in the desert!  This place is/was amazing! My hubby wasn't feeling well so we went out looking for a ramen place and of course we used Yelp! Mahalo Yelp for your findings! Low and behold we drove up to this finding!  It was already late in the afternoon, hardly anyone in there so it was nice and quiet! The food is really good! They are known for their sushi and udon noodles and I'm sure many more!  Nice customer service very quaint and food came out quickly. Ramen that we ordered was okay nothing to spectacular with the broth and noodles, but, the sushi was really good and tasty! We will be back for their happy hour selection   I'm glad I did not listen to a friend whose a fool and knows nothing about eating sushi in Arizona! What he's missing out!

Being an out of state and shopping around to find the best deals of where you are traveling and skeptical of renting from a rental company you have no knowledge nor history about is kinda scary. Especially reading the reviews on Yelp and seeing some negative view points of past customer experience is even more not trustworthy.  But, I come to realize that although there are customers comments on here that just makes me Shake my head and they do have the right to their opinions but, let me just say what an amazing amazing rental company with excellent customer service they have. Not only that but, their vehicles are way better than your normal budget, Alamo, enterprise and even COSTCO deals.  I stayed here in Arizona for over a week and normally I would book my rental car through Costco travel I originally was going to pay $501.00 with tax for a basic Hyundai Santa Fe which I would of been fine with but, I just knew there had to be another rental car offering a cheaper deal and sure enough I found sixt at first I couldn't believe my eyes of how reasonable their cars are. They are actually known for their luxury European cars which is totally out of my league so I opt to get their standard mid size suv- GMC Arcadia. Something simple, easy to drive and get around since this trip was half business/personal.  When I came to the rental car company it's right in the M hotel in the old Scottsdale yes, ritzy rich and business area but, soo nice. The lady that greeted me had all my information she was soo nice and by herself. So she moved swiftly and I got my car really fast. I was Sooo surprised when she pulled up because it was the gmc that I ordered but, it was the deluxe special with the sunroof, leather seat, power everything it was very very nice and very roomy! Perfect that's exactly what I wanted and I saved a few hundred dollars, I like that deal a lot. You really can't complain getting a deluxe model vs a basic Hyundai Santa Fe. The only negative I had is when inspecting the vehicle exterior was okay a few dents here and there which is normal but, the interior I found a cold Starbucks coffee and we gave it to the rental car clerk, she was very embarrassed and apologetic.  The car drove soo smooth and perfect I loved driving it every single day... This rental car is amazing even dropping it off at a different location was amazing! If your looking for a great deal and a bang for your buck you need to try them out! If I do rent a car and they are in the area of where I am traveling I will definitely go through them instead of the regular hertz, enterprise, budget, Costco travel and etc try them out you will definitely not be disappointed... Their customer service isn't that bad as well! Top notch

Beautiful morning to start our day and checking out the Uptown Farmers Market! Sooo much to see soo much to do and there is sooo many dog lovers here! Beautiful and well maintained dogs just happy to be amongst the crowds! They even have different color water bowls just for our four legged friends!  I love coming to support local farmers and local vendors. You know these are striving families and small business local owners making it in this economy and knowing that your money is going to benefit in some ways makes it even better!! I did it every Saturday back at home (Hawaii) and although i miss my fresh poi, laulaus, veggies, and flowers this will be something new to explore to change my habits!  But, I'm curious as we brought an Acaci bowl and walked around it seemed as no one knew what it was!! Gosh, if you don't it's a must have especially for a breakfast meal to start your day off! We love our Acaci bowls and the guy that makes it and sells it at this market his one is the bomb! It's sooo refreshing, with all the toppings on it! But, his Acaci is very tasty and sweet! Just how I like it he is the first Acaci bowl I had since arriving here in AZ & he forever has won me as his customer weekly!!! In Hawaii this is super popular it gets a little crazy with the toppings but, you gotta try his one if your at this market... Just be patient cuz it's only him!  T

Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Over pizza... But, not just over a pizza but, a deep dish pizza Chicago style. I've never been to Chicago nor have anything to compare this too other than Pizza Hut or CPK!  That's the only pizza I've been around and in San Diego! But, this pizza was aaammmmaaazzziinnngg!  Upon our arrival it was super crowded, people outside with their family members waiting outside at least there are chairs and a nice grassy area for kids to run around. The crowd well it's too be expected since I heard this is the first Chicago deep dish pizza in the desert/valley area and they recently opened last week, so it's a new hype place!   Well, as we were entering and placing our name on the one hour wait list. There were two seats opening up at the bar and we gracefully went over to grab it and crossed our name off the wait list and decided to have beers and our dinner there with Nikki, Holly, and the rest of the gang! This was sooo nice if you don't have kids go straight to the bar much faster beats the wait list.   Nikki and Holly were sooo very nice, upbeat, super friendly, courteous, having fun, and very conversational! Don't you hate it when sometimes you go to the bar and the bartenders are such duds with no personality... Well, not here total opposite and loved every minute I was sitting at the bar!   Nikki had suggested we try the buffalo green salad and I'm so very thankful we did! Gosh, what a interesting mix of greens. It had buffalo (which normally I don't care to eat), gorgonzola cheese, their delicious house dressing mixed, and watermelon. It was the best tasting salad I've had in Phoenix & the first time to try it with all these different Flavors. It was sooo yummy!!!  On to the pizza, we had to stick to the original deep dish pizza with the butter crust. We figure we ordered the medium pizza (serves about 3ppl) I told my husband get the small size because I'm not a big eater, literally one slice is normally my limit! Lol and sure enough the taste and my first bite into the sauce, cheese, and crust was just yummy! Flavors of all sorts was dancing around and it was almost melting in my mouth as I devoured one piece! It was sooo huge and plenty! I also think having a few beers didn't help the process of me wanting to have another piece! I was a happy camper!   I really enjoyed last nights dinner, I enjoyed being out, and trying something sooo new! Can't wait for my kids to come up and take them over here to try some Chicago pizza!   Mahalo Nikki and Holly (I hope I'm saying your names correctly) for making our night fun!

Mahalo Yelp again for bringing us to this new hot spot in North of Scottsdale and close to our hale.  Nice and quaint little place, family style, feels welcoming when you come in and the owner she is sooo pleasant. Such a beautiful soul she has! I've only been in Arizona for a few days and missing my island food is something I am going through at this moment especially coming down with a congested cold isn't fun! But, stumbling on this place through Yelp was a wonderful idea!  We had the pad Thai beef and curry chicken with steam rice. The dishes are very tasty and onolicious.. I really enjoyed all the items we had and the owner was very very pleasant and personable! They even have the mango sticky rice which is a rare commodity back in Hawaii so when she said she had that my face lit up and my chin grew big! Gosh, I was in heaven when I took my first bite... It was YUMMERZ!!! Now I know and now I'll be back!!! lol
