Service was quick.  The place makes several pizzas and then throws your slice in for a quick reheat.  Because the crust is so thin it comes out cracker like after a re-heat.  The pizza was ok but I'd rather go up north to Ray's or a little farther west to Taste of Italy.

4 Peaks is great.  Terrific for lunch, happy hour or dinner. They serve normal bar fair.  The beers are all pretty good. I suggest pumpkin porter in the fall when it is available.

They will get your order wrong about 50% of the time.

We go here just about once a week.  The pizza is good and hot.  The people that own it are nice.
