The lady ophthalmologist (the name has escaped me) is phenomenal. Brought my 3 year old and 2 month old and she was so understanding and helpful. She even followed up on a vision concern I had for my two month old although I was there for my eye exam. I had to breastfeed my baby at a point in the appointment in which she was very comfortable and understanding about (AMAZING!!) They always give me samples if I run out of contacts which is a lifesaver. The glasses part moved pretty quick - I had picked out my glasses while I was waiting for my eye exam . 100% recycled frames which not all vision places offer and after my exam she processed my order very quickly because she knew I had kids and couldn't hang around. The contacts came in a week and my fairly high prescription eye glasses came in less then 2 weeks. Definitely a family friendly eye center .

Kevin is great! He was extremely efficient and very knowledgeable. He came to fix my clogged shower and while he was here he checked a toilet that has been running for some time. The parts had been degraded and he went to grab the parts we needed same day to replace it. No more running! While he was here our pest control guy spotted a leak and I asked Kevin if he could check it out. He turned off the water to the landscaping and the leak has since stopped. He showed me the water pressure level and how high it was. He is coming to put a water pressure regulator on it for us. I know there are plenty of plumbers out there but Kevin is your guy!

There is a reason this restaurant has SO many 5 star reviews! The service and food is PHENOMENAL. I am at the point where I want to bring everyone I know to this place after trying it out. I came in with 2 of my closest friends for a birthday around 8pm. It was busy but they were still able to seat us right away. I had my 2 month old baby with me. I am breastfeeding so it is hard to leave him at home and as many moms know at that age they really don't have a set bed time. The host staff was so welcoming and instead of being weirded out that I brought an infant carrier into a gastro pub they responded with excitement and loved seeing my little one. After we were seated the service was just wonderful. The server (I wish I remembered his name- I think Alex) was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We had a couple small dishes, the fabulous chop salad, and dessert. This review is a little late (we dined in November) but it needed to happen. If you haven't been here YOU NEED TO GO!!

Had a wonderful experience with this company! If it wasn't for the extremely thorough home inspection I wouldn't have found out that I had a leak on the side of my house. They went through my entire front and back yard to assess ways I can prevent pests at no profit or extra revenue for them. This company is honest, professional, and they want to educate the consumer about what preventative measures the consumer can take. 5 stars!

Came in for coffee at the Cafe during the farmers market on Saturday and received the worst service possible. I work in the service industry and could not imagine giving paying customers that terrible of service. When I went to the counter initially I was greeted by two men who did not say hello and their expression made me question whether I should get drinks from them in the first place. After I ordered my 2 coffee drinks I went with the cup for regular coffee to the canisters that hold the coffee while one of the bartenders worked on my latte (the coffee was for my boyfriend). The canisters were all just about empty and although I'm pretty sure they saw me trying to squeeze coffee out the bartenders did nothing. I filled half the cup with decaf because I wanted to avoid these annoyed looking guys who made me feel uncomfortable and inconvenient. When I went for the creamer it was empty and I contemplated just forgetting the coffee but decided to ask them for more. The whole coffee area was a disaster. My boyfriend had arrived by that point and felt the same vibes as me. The latte had taken a little longer than expected (which is fine) but because they never asked my name or gave me a number I went up to ask if the drink on the counter was mine and the bartender just laughed at me and said no. How the heck am I supposed to know if it's my drink!! They just set it there without saying anything! The whole experience felt condescending and uncomfortable which is a darn shame because the place is so cute and the farmers market is AWESOME! I'm sure the food is good but I would never go back in to try it or recommend it because of that experience. I definitely haven't been to a lot of "hospitality" based establishments where I feel like I just threw my money in the garbage.

Consumer Beware! Brought in my IPAD 2 to get the screen fixed. The IPAD 2 was fully functional the day before. I have owned this IPAD for years and have used it very little until recently so there is definitely quite a bit of life left. I brought it in to Digital Doc at around 4pm and was told that it wasn't turning on so they couldn't work on it till the following day. Saturday rolls around.. My fiancée gets a call that it won't turn on and they want to charge us 40 dollars to work on it and check to see if it needs a new battery. My fiancée says no because we know it was fully functional before we brought it in and the battery life is amazing. The battery had died from regular use and we knew that. We forgot to charge it before we brought it in. My fiancée is a very experienced IT guy so we had a feeling we were being scammed. He walks into the store and they nervously tell him that it just turned on but it's turning on but won't hold a charge. No thank you. They said maybe the first cable was bad. My fiancée asked if they tried a different cable and they said no. This place is a scam. We immediately took the IPAD home instead of having them "work on it" and it works great with the exception of cracked glass. If you don't have experience with technology you could easily be scammed and not know any better. I trust Yelp and use them to make many decisions on businesses and this company should not have a near 5 star review.  Update: Brought the IPAD to a different store and they replaced the glass and informed me that they don't need a passcode to replace the glass (I put one on before I brought it in) while Digital Doc told me they need it unlocked. If this was a restaurant I would have went back to try it again but because the IPAD may contain sensitive info I did not feel comfortable with it after my initial experience
