I hired Around the Whorl to do my prints so I could run my own background check while job hunting. Annmarie was on time and did a very professional job. I was so impressed with the service and price that I called her back a few months later to fingerprint my son so I would have his prints on file.  Again, Annmarie was extremely friendly and put my son right at ease (he was a little nervous about the process). The pricing was great as usual and I feel better having a copy of his prints. Great work Around the Whorl

Stopped in Saturday for lunch. Sign on main door said to enter through the hooka because of renovations. I did and the place was empty. Waited for about 5 minutes and called out to see if anyone was there. No response. Went to the Delhi Palace buffet up the street. Maybe service will improve after the renovations are complete

I went back here to try again after my disappointing first attempt. This time I was very pleased. The food was excellent and the portions on the lunch combo were perfect. I'm really glad I tried again, this place will  become a regular for me!
