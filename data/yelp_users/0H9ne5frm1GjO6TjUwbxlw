I love the food and semi-dislike the ambiance. I don't like eating in plastic lawn chairs. And most of the servers have that  "I'm way cooler than this in real life" attitude. All that said, I could eat the fried tofu in dragon black bean sauce every day....and I don't really like tofu - but this is just different and wonderful! Lots of fresh vegies, wonderful creative ingredients on the entire menu and the cocktail menu was pretty cool as well. My husband tried some sort of basil ginger tini last time - it was wonderful! I would give the place five stars if the seats and service were nicer.

I love the zoo! My family has a membership and it is used well. For anyone with kids under 10 living in the Valley of the Sun, membership is a must! This way, there is no pressure to see the entire park in one visit. There are so many activities for kids, that we usually cover half the park per visit.  Favorite actvities at the zoo include: the monkey walk (there is no wall seperating you from the monkeys and they jump around the walking path - so fun!), the many kid parks/fountains to play in, the kids petting zoo, and the old giant turtles.   Also, try out Zoo Lights! You can't use your membership to get it, but it's well worth the extra expense. We went in early July - dress your kids in bathing suits and bring tons of water! There are water activities everywhere, and the paths are lit up with magical lights.  If you are visiting from out of town, the Zoo is well worth the trip. If it's a hot month, go early and take the train tour to save energy. Bring water!!

I love this place!!! Amazing wine list that changes frequently, great food, fun atmosphere - what more could you ask for??? The bruschetta are to die for!!! Prosciutto, marscapone cheese and figs are Camille H's favorite. I could eat an entire plate of the salmon pesto bruschetta. The artichoke was amazing as was the roasted pepper and goat cheese. My mouth is watering, just thinking about it!!! Camille H and I have been here a few times and always do bruschettta and share the picnic salad - goat cheese, beets, bacon.....so so wonderful.   This place is loud - not necessarily a good place for a  first date if you want to get to know each other, unless yelling is your thing. Although, if you are both very hot, and love to see and be seen, this is a great spot for that!  I would NOT recommend bringing a child here. It's too loud and the food has too many "adult" ingredients.  OH and I learned (the $3 way) that you always say to the Valet that you are going to Le Grand Orange, and not Postino because then you don't have to pay for the valet service.

Place smells very very musky-mildewy. I should have left when I smelled the place. I ordered their "house chicken" - it was basically overcooked fried chicken in a very watered down teriyaki sauce - I ate two bites and asked for the check. Husband ordered beef with broccoli - it was cold. Don't waste your time. Go to Great Wok instead for great take out.

Order the baked scallop roll and the ahi salad - you will be happy. This is not a sushi place for creative rolls - it is a very basic menu. But if you order the two items mentioned above, you will be happy. Once we ordered this big seafood soup with a bunch of shellfish in it - it was very good as well. It usually fills up quickly at lunch, so you have to get in a little early.

This is such a fun date restaurant. They have booths with curtains so you can...feed each other!!! They even knock before they open the curtains! Yes - it is expensive, but you are paying for the experience!   I highly recommend the Caribbean cheese fondue - it was not an intuitive choice, but was very delicious. Strawberries in dark chocolate fondue is also wonderful.   I went here for a girls night out once, and had a ton of fun. On that evening, we were not behind curtains, but in a long dining area with other ladies doing the same thing.   One note - the cocktails are extremely sweet - so you may want to stick to wine.

I went to happy hour this evening with two girlfriends. This may be one of the best happy hours in Ahwatukee. $3 Beer, $5 Wine & $6 Cocktails  +  fondue and appetizer specials. We had the wisconson trio, a yummy blue cheese fontina concoction, which was served with  bread, apples and vegies.  For dessert,  we shared the dark chocolate fondue w/ extra strawberries. It was delish!  The only thing that would have made this better was if the bar was packed. We were the only peeps there.  I hope the happy hour word spreads because happy hour is best in large groups of happy people.

I like their salsa, chips and prices. They put some sort of strange chemistry-made cheese substance in their burritos that is kind of gross - it tastes like a combo of cream cheese, american cheese and sour cream - everything tastes premade and slapped together - nothing tastes fresh. I have only been here twice, and prefer Chipotle's over this any day of the week!

I really really wanted to like this place because it's relatively close to our house. The prawns on our salad were not cooked all the way, and the Tom Yum Gong soup was bland. Not sure how you can make that soup bland, but they did it. The under-cooked food was enough to cure me for life - I won't go back.

Waking thru the country store, I was not sure I was in the right place. All those cars outside on a sunday morning led me to believe I had to sprint to the hostess stand for a table. But this place is huge, and there was no wait at all. They could even seat six tops without a wait! We scored a table right by the front window, and were immediately greeted by a friendly waitress for drinks. She pointed out the two most popular dishes on the menu - pancake breakfast (think grand slam at denny's)  or the standard meat, eggs, biscuits and gravy.Big menu, but no omelets? I had the french toast w/ bacon. It was cold and leathery. Husband had the grand-slam thing - it was a lot o f food w/ a  big bowl of  canned tasting gravy.   Food was just ok. Coffee was bad. Service was great. Won't go back  - there are better breakfast places in Ahwatukee.

We tried to go here today after my daughter's dance recital. She picked the place. It was 2:45pm. I asked if we could have a booth, and the hostess said, "well, here's the problem. A lot of our servers just want to get out of here, so the only room I can seat you is in here", pointing  to one little overly crowed area. My husband and I looked at each other in shock, and said, "well, we can help them get out of here. We'll just go eat somewhere else!" I will NEVER go back! How freakin tacky!!!

I have never actually eaten in the restaurant - just take out.  I LOVE the caprese salad, the plentiful antipasto salad, and the Mykanos pizza. The pesto pizzas are delish as well. This is perfect thin crust pizza - not that doughy pizza. Such yummy food. Highly recommend this place!  One note on take out: They tend to say "20 minutes", which really means 30-40 minutes. But who cares when the food is so good!

Customer Service: 5 stars Massage: 10 stars if I could give it! Facial: not sure - I've only had one before now Ambiance: 3.5 stars Value: 20++ stars!!!  After reading the rave reviews on Yelp, I made an appoinment for a three hour "Relax" package that included 50 min. massage, 50 min. facial and Spa Pedi.   The outside of the building is confusing. It's a SPA, but it looks so tiny from the outside that I wasn't sure I was at the right place. The SPA is a converted one story office building in strip mall with lots of small rooms down a long narrow hall way. The decor was beautiful inside - relaxing, clean and cozy. But slightly cramped. Given the amazing value and wonderful service, I can easily overlook these things!  I got there 25 minutes early, and Becky, the *amazing* masseuse, started on me early. I am not sure how long the massage was, but my guess is 90 minutes, and it was heavenly. Becky is so so good - best massage experience in the valley!! She put warm pads on my back as she started to work - and then used deep pressure as I requested the entire time. It was wonderful!!!  After the massage, I waited about ten minutes in a cozy lounge room for the facial room to be ready.  I had been uneasy about getting another facial - my first and only other experience was terrible (won't go into details). This was refreshing and relaxing. Once again, I am not sure facials are my favorite type of pampering, but it was not a bad experience.  Since the massage and facial took three hours and I needed to get home, they allowed me to skip the pedicure and pro-rated the cost. I love this place and will definitely be back. Highly recommend this place! :-)

All I have to say is that Becky is by far THE BEST masseuse I have ever been to EVER. I love her! I wish I could go visit her every day. She used hot stones, hot pads, warm wash cloths, all different kinds of oils for different parts of the body, and all different applications of pressure and techniques - amazing! I was so happy, rejuvenated and relaxed after my massage this week - I wish I could bottle that feeling and sip on it all day!

Life can be stressful and it is good to know that places like Aji Spa exist to quiet your mind and be pampered. I have only been to one spa before this in Santa Cruz, so this is not a spa girl gone wild review.   I walked in and was pleasantly greeted by a nice gentleman with a soothing voice. A woman came over to show me the amenities, provide a locker and the coziest warmest softest bathrobe I have ever worn. Before my massage, I sat in a cozy room with a beautiful adobe fireplace where I listened to peaceful flute music and drank cucumber water. The room was so peaceful that I felt relaxed before I had the massage. There was another woman also waiting in the room, but the place is big enough for two or three to sit and not have to talk to each other. (I personally don't like chit chat before a rub down.)   I had a 50 minute massage from a lovely gentle giant. He layed hot towels over my back and feet during the massage, and applied perfect pressure. I was in heaven the entire time.   The pool was closed the day I was there, so I hung out in the hot tub most of the time. There was one in door and one outdoor hot tub. Both of them were lovely. The inside tub could most likely seat about five comfortably. There was a large bowl next to the hot tub filled with iced washcloths to place over your eyes - they had cucumbers in them - really interesting for someone not used to this treatment. (no - I didn't eat them!)  I tried the steam room and the sauna but just am too immature for this stuff. I felt like I couldn't breath in the sauna and I couldn't focus my eyes in the steam room. Both rooms seemed like they would be nice experiences for those who like this sort of thing.   I would go back again all the time if I was a millionaire, but my peasant salary only allows me such experiences about once a year.

I loved our sandwiches and the complimentary low cal ice cream was a huge plus. We ordered takeout.  I had the california club on a new orleans french roll. It was wonderful - crispy french roll, guacamole, sprouts, tomato, turkey and swiss. Everything tasted fresh and looked prepared with love. Nothing looked pre-made. Husband had the pastrami melt - it was delish - I dare say I liked his sandwhich more than mine. I am just so happy to have found a deli near Ahwatukee that isn't full of pre-made sandwiches on nasty bread.....Jason's Deli will be our new favorite close to home.

I LOVE this place!!! Fresh ingredients, paleo-diet options, free range chicken, grass fed beef - does it get any better? A "healthy" burrito??? It sounds like an oxymoron, but this place does it!!! I love that you can pick how much of everything you want, and can even have seconds of different salsas. If I am craving a burrito, there is where I go!!! YUMMM!!!!

This place was packed with corporate power lunch peeps! Right when we sat down, they brought us salad - I love instant munchables. We had the Tom Ka Gong (shrimp?) soup with a level four spiciness. Now, I have a really really high spice tolerance, and a level four knocked my socks off! I was weeping with hot chili joy (eek - bad description, but you get the point!). The soup had a small amount of coconut in it, but was not heavy and rich where you cannot eat anything else. I chose the red curry chicken from the lunch menu at a level 3 spiciness - that was a perfect amount of heat for me! Even though the place was packed, our food came quickly and was piping hot. Great experience! We will be back!

Holy Chambord Margarita! Where have you been all my life???  My first time, we did happy hour. Service was slow, but the food and drink made up for it. We ordered three appetizers and two rounds of the delish chambord margaritas. I am not usually one for frozen drinks, but this was wonderful - like frozen raspberry lemonade with a great kick!  My second time, I went with a big group of kids and adults for lunch. Everything we ordered was perfect and delish and the service was great.  The third time, I went just for the chambord margerita on a friday night with my husband around 10pm. It was standing room only - packed - all the pre-clubbers were getting their drink on.   I have been another handful of times just for the Chambord Margerita. The food is great, but the prices are a bit high for what you get. I will still frequent.

This is a happy hour review only. I have never been for dinner. I love this place. The bar is kind of small, so you have to get there early if you want a seat for happy hour...or go on an odd week night. Camille H. already described the happy hour menu very well. In addition to the burger, the crab cakes are amazing - 100% crab meat and no filler/breadcrumbs. The cocktails are yummy - I had the white cosmo last night - delish!   I would give the place 5 stars, but am always unhappy with the service. They are all very snooty and pretentious. If they were just nice and real, I would love this place even more.

I ordered a custom cake with one day notice, and was very happy with it. The black forrest cake was delish! I will definitely come back. I am from the SF Bay Area, and have been unimpressed with bakeries in Phoenix until I found this place. It was a nice dense cake that was not overly sugary. All the ingredients tasted fresh, and the service at the bakery was wonderful.

I took an collage class here once, and really loved the store. If you are looking for that rare stamp and don't want to buy online, check this place out. This is a mom and pop shop that specializes in all things crafty - special glues, pens, stencils, ribbons, papers and stamps. The way the room in layed out, it will take awhile to see everything, but I think it was set up that way on purpose. Also, if you take a class, you get 10% off your purchases on the day of the class.  I find that "crafters" treat the topic like a secret club, so I could understand Meredith S' frustration at the shop. The owner and others in the class didn't give me warm fuzzies either, but I am one of those resilient freaks that can still enjoy myself when I'm not part of the club.

I was surprised to see that this place has such low ratings on yelp- it is one of my favorite Mexican places in the valley.  Favorite dishes include: mini beef tacos, Tapopo Salad (iceberg lettuce, cheddar cheese, chicken, peas, corn, beans, tomatoes and large amount of quacamole under it all), fresh salsa, and Tacos Al Carbon. All freshly prepared and wonderful tasting.  If you have kids, ask to sit in the blue room by the fish tank - the decor is fun and mysterious and will keep young children distracted thru the entire meal.

I've been here a few times on date nights, and LOVE IT. We have only been here once when a comedian was so bad there was crickets, but he was one of the starting acts. All the others were hilarious. We've seen Gabriel Iglesias, Rob Schneider, and someone else, but that was too long ago to remember.  I've never tried the food, but heard it stinks. The beer and cocktail prices are fair - not as bad as a concert but a buck or two higher than a restaurant.  This place would have a five star review if the seats were more comfortable. It's pretty cramped and the seats are not comfortable at all. If they fixed that, we would go here all the time!

I've been here twice - once for happy hour and once for dinner.  Happy Hour Review: One of the best happy hour offerings I have seen in the valley, but not a huge $$ value. Great food choices that aren't offered on the standard menu. The hours are very limiting, and you can only sit in the extremely small bar area, so you have to be there early to get in on the HH menu. The artichoke dip and the bruschetta were wonderful!!!   Dinner Review: We chose outdoor seating under the beautiful trees near the fireplace. It is such a romantic place for an evening out with the one you love! Our server was fantastic and had great suggestions! The mussels were some of the BEST I ever had - they were served in a wonderfully creamy chorizo sauce w/ yummy toasted bread for dipping. For entrees, we had the ahi wellington and the rabbit. The ahi was a little underwhelming - the presentation was gorgeous, but slightly bland. The wasabi mash fondue was just mashed potatoes with an extremely small smidge of wasabi - nothing really fondue or wasabi about it. The rabbit is one of their house specialties - it was absolutely delish! The only downside to the bunny is that it wasn't cooked until it was falling off the bone, which just isn't acceptable for a place like this. For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake - it was dense and not very ooh or ahh inspiring - I've had better.  My take is that this place is great for ambiance and almost there for food, but something's missing. I expected every plate to be amazing, and was a little let down with the final delivery. I will probably go back again, but it's not my top pick for the money shelled out. I would much rather go back to Chelsae's Kitchen or Cafe Monarch.

One week before I moved out of Phoenix, I finally decided to wait 1.5 hours for pizza and find out what all the hoopla was about! The host with the mullet and glasses was so so nice! I loved him - he was so excited about the menu, the ingredients, the fact that they are grown in the back yard - I could listen to his enthusiasm all night.   The pizza was amazing - it's not really pizza....it's doughy delish goodness - a heavenly substance and well worth the 1.5 hour wait.....once. Not sure I'd go back over and over, but glad I tried it once.  The anti pasta plate was really the highlight. All different types of grilled vegies prepared in different ways. Each bite was fun and exciting.   You have to try this place at least once! Think of it less as "food" and more as an experience!!

Great place for yummy crunchy doughy rolls with basic deli fixings or exotic combos like spicy chicken, cilantro and vegies.  The iced coffee is really really good too. Spring rolls taste wonderful too. And did I mention that the prices are the best in town for a deli sandwich?   Note: do not go here thinking "gourmet italian deli" - this is more of a standard sub on a better roll at a better price.

This is my current favorite restaurant in the valley.The Tuna Tartare is my favorite thing  - a generous amount of high grade ahi tuna with guacamole. My description does not do it justice - you must just go there and order it to understand how heavenly it is! The Del Mar Salad is covered with shrimp and crab in a tasty citrusy tangy dressing. The Short Ribs are so perfectly cooked that you don't even need a knife to cut them - they melt in your mouth. Oh! I almost forgot to mention the white sangria - order a pitcher - it is so so wonderful! The restaurant is very beautiful inside and the service is great.

My parents flew in from the SF Bay Area, and I couldn't wait to take them here. It was the first time we brought our four year old along for the experience. We had a beautiful table outside - the plants around us were in full bloom, and the food was (as usual) perfect and magical. My step-mom has gone to culinery school, and is one of the best people I know at name-that-ingredient game. She also is the biggest stickler on good service - hates being overly tended to or ignored. She was so blown away by the food, service, and atmosphere that she actually weeped happy tears of joy - I have never seen this happen before, except when our daughter was born. This place is seriously the best!

I don't get it. Why is this place so great? It must be because it's one of the only theaters showing non-mainstream films.  I *love* seeing  non-mainstream film and there's a theater in Santa Cruz, CA and another in SFO that make sense for this....these CA  theaters have more than six rows in each theater, the demographics do not remind me of cruise ships, and the vibe is less pretentious.  I don't like tiny tiny theaters that smell and cost a lot of money. I won't go back here. The theaters are so small that it's almost like watching tv in your own living room. I won't go back to this place.

This place has so many hidden treasures! Give yourself at least half an hour your first time, so you can smell every dish of amazing herbs, spices and blends. My favorite items include the chipotle powder, country french vinaigrette, Extra Fancy Vietnamese Cinamon, and Trinidad Lemon & Garlic Marinade. Be sure to grab their magazine when you leave - it has recipes in it using their spices.

DO NOT GO TO CONCERTS HERE!!! I payed $250/seat for "row 32" in section 105. Now, "row 32" generally means there will be approximately 32 people between you and the stage. This seat was more like the nose bleed section. The people on the stage looked like action figures they were so far away. Also, the lighting in the place is terrible. When a band starts to play, the room is supposed to go completely dark - this place is so lit up with hotdog and beer stands, the stage effects didn't work. The performers were amazing, but the venue is terrible. We will never go to a concert here again.

I love this bookstore! Used and new titles at affordable prices, helpful staff, lots of fun gifty items. I love bookstores where the fiction section has large tables filled with great suggestions - I don't think you can leave this place without buying something. There's a great religion/spirituality/new age section (I even got to see some random dude meditating and blocking the hallway. You know it's a great bookstore when there are men criss-cross-apple-sauce deep in thought blocking the isles.) The bookstore has a very grass-roots-helping-local-businesses-succeed atmosphere. I will buy here (and trade in) often.

I want to permanently live at my new favorite stay-cation destination!!!   At checkin, I was asked which room location I would like (all of which came with a balcony!)  - my choices included - pool view, lagoon view, quiet buildings, those located near the party area - so many choices! I was in heaven!! We chose a room overlooking the lagoon - semi close to the pool, but far enough away to have zero noise. At night, there's a fire fountain in the middle of the lagoon that was so wonderful to watch while sitting on the balcony sipping lemon drops and having deep talks.  The amenities were FANTASTIC! There are two water slides that kept us busy w/ the 5YO for hours. There are nice size gates around the pool area and it felt very safe and clean. The adult lounge area was very sleek and beautiful. Next time, we will bring friends so we can hang here and leave the kids with a babysitter at night!  All of the grounds were wonderfully lush and landscaped nicely. I never saw one piece of garbage on the ground anywhere.  The room was lovely - beautiful decor, great materials, no detail was compromised and the place was perfectly clean. Even with the loud fire fountain outside and the ice machine outside our room, our room was completely quiet inside - it was a great experience.  We bought our room with miles, but given the amazing rates, I think we will have to have one more weekend here.   Here's a link to the great summer rates. http://www.fairmont.com/scottsdale/HotelPackages/SpecialOffer/SummerSale.htm  I would recommend bringing your own booze - we bought two boat drinks by the pool for a little under $30 including tip. Thank goodness we had our own mixers in our room for the rest of the stay!  Highly Highly Highly Highly recommend this place!!!

For those of you from the SF Bay Area, this venue is just like Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View. There are three sections of seating , and then lawn behind that. They have giant screens so you can see the performers from the lawn. Parking is free. I will definitely go to shows there again.

From the outside, you would never know how great this place is! Wonderful sushi at great prices - lots of different rolls to choose from. Gave me hope that there may be hope for sushi in the valley after living in the SF bay area surrounded by many wonderful sushi bars. It's always a good sign if there are lots of japanese people eating at a sushi place - this is the case at Sushi Ken. The only thing I wish is that sushi places in the valley would not put spicy mayo or cream cheese in every "creative" role on their menu. The crazy roll is very good. The lunch specials are a great value and always prepared fresh. The kid's box meal is tasty - my daughter loves it - lots of choices.

There are  two  large doggy play yards - one  for dogs under 20 pounds and one for dogs over 20 pounds. Sometimes, people don't know what a little tiny purse size dog weighs, and  they bring them in  the wrong yard. It is always fun to watch a lab try to wrestle with a chihuahua.   Some people also feel it is necessary to keep their dog on a leash even though there are large gates protecting the dogs from escaping. My friends, if your dog does not behave off the leash, it does not belong in a dog park with other dogs. :)  These two issues - dog size and leash/no-leash - exist at dog parks near and far - I just like  to help gently guide those new to the scene.  Also, never wear clothes you love to a dog park.  You may be confused for a lamp post or fire hydrant, and become a conduit for pee-mail.  Watching spaced out dog owners get sniffed and peed on is funny no matter how many times you see it happen.  Bring water for yourself - there is one covered picnic table in each fenced off area. And bring a leash - you have to have your dog on t he leash until you get inside the gated area.  Great park. Big enough for the big dogs to run a lot and get tired.  Because of the separate  yards, little dogs can have fun too.

Even though I'm a fan, I'm not allowed back without a helmet.   My daughter has attended many wonderful birthday parties here. This is a great birthday facility for toddlers - tweens.   Before you go into the rooms, the kids and adults watch a video about safety on the slides and bounce rooms. One of the rules they emphasize is *getting out of the way* when you get to the bottom of the slide so you don't get hit by the next kid/adult on the slide.  Well, my beautiful girl did not listen carefully, got all spaced out at the bottom of a slide, and slammed by some kid at the party. Next thing I know, she is screaming in my arms  that her arm hurts. The party starts to move into the next bounce room, and I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to calm down my screamer and get in the other room so the next party can start in the first bounce room. Every time, I moved, the screaming increased a few decibels. The people that worked there came to assess the situation and help, but I told them proudly that I had it all under control. Then I fainted.   I woke up in some big man's arms all confused. When you wake up dazed and confused in a stranger's arms, the first thing you do is make sure you have clothes on. Check! Next thing was panic - where is my little girl? When I fainted, the party moved quickly to the other room with all the kids including my screamer, and three parents and two staff members stayed behind to revive me. My husband picked us up and I have been too embarrassed to go back since.  Even though I have to wear a helmet to parties here, I still think it's a great place and highly recommend it! Just make sure your kid is well rested before they get there, and maybe run through some fire drills on quickly getting out of the way.

I love this place. Dr. Petersen is wonderful with kids - she is gentle and sweet and has loads of wonderful parenting advice for such things as potty training and sleeping habits. Her Nurse Practitioner, Mrs. Ricketts is equally wonderful. At some offices, if you hear that your symptoms only qualify for a nurse visit, you wonder if you will get a thorough checkup. Mrs Ricketts is wonderful - she takes her time and has lots of great home remedies for simple ailments instead of over the counter medicine. The office is kept very clean, and the staff are extremely friendly. I am very happy we found this place.

When we are too tired to cook, and want a guaranteed yummy pizza, this is the place to go. OR when we meet  up with other friends that  have  kids under five, we meet up here.   Favorite pizzas are the combo or  all meat pizza. They have all  the standard toppings and their crust is semi-thick. For those from the SF Bay Area, this place reminds me of Round Table.  The kids spaghetti and meatballs is so  yummy, and  the prices are right.  There's a place for little kids to play in the dining  room.  I think it must be an annoying place to eat if you do not have kids.  One  time, a man  yelled at me because all the loud kids in the place were annoying him -  I thought it was funny because I was only responsible for one of the ten running around. Bottom line, this place caters to families  -  so if you are a kid-less couple looking for a quiet romantic pizza dinner, order take out!

I love this place! I can find stylish  jeans for my daughter for $6! Shirts are usually around $4. I love how organized the selection is. Also, if you have kids in dance, they have a wonderful selection of used dance wear. My daughter seems to outgrow her clothes every 6 months - the offerings at this store are priced right!  I would give it 5 stars, but the selection isn't 100% great. You look thru stuff and think "that's junk"  sometimes - at Love Child Resale, the review is more like do I want item A or B more? All in all, a great store.

My daughter attended a birthday party at this place. It was so cool! Ten little girls getting dressed up like rock stars and princesses, fancy hair styles and learning to apply makeup. After they were all dolled up, they walk down a red carpet and were introduced on microphone for their first ever cat walk. They were so cute and excited the entire time. The goodie bags include all the makeup they got to put on and a craft made during the party.  The only reason it got four out of five stars is because the room for the party is really really tiny, and there's very little space for parents to sit and watch.

We have left our dog here over several vacations. They have dog suites and basic boarding. They allow social dogs to play together during the day, and then they go in their separate spots at night.   One time, we opted to have our dog shampooed before we picked him up. He broke out in a rash all over his skin for about a week and a half. He wasn't complaining about it, so the vet said he was fine, but I won't have that service done again. (would have given five stars, except for that issue.) Never had any issues with the boarding - just the grooming. I will take my dog here again.

I frequent this place at least once a week to enjoy the wonderful affordable AND low cal fro yo at Golden Spoon. I LOVE this place. They have all the standard toppings and even carry seasonal flavors like Pumpkin (my personal favorite). The fro yo does come out soft, so I sometimes take it home and freeze it so it gets icey. All this considered, it still deserves five stars.   How can it be that we live in the scorching hot desert and there is only a handful of fro yo possibilities in the area? Of all the strip malls full of nail spas, tanning salons and every random franchised experience under the sun, why are there only a few jumping on the fro yo lovin train?

After the Jazz Fest last year, we popped into this place for a quick bite. It was packed! Even with every table taken and big wait, we were seated pretty quickly, and the service was amazingly attentive, considering how packed it was. We had sausages, fish and chips and tasty beer. Everything came out  hot and delish. My toddler enjoyed chicken and french fries from the kids menu.  I love going to pubs where everyone seems to be having a great time - this was my kind of place. We will definitely go back. I didn't give it five stars because the food didn't wow me - it was just yummy.

I've been to Benihana and other teppanyaki places before. This one sucked.   I decided it would be fun to suprise my five year old daughter with a new experience - Benihana's! I talked up the place all the way there - they will cook the food in front of us and do tricks - you won't beleive it! Her eyes were so big as we walked in and I couldn't wait to see her amazement at the show and food.   I was shocked to see that the kid's chicken lunch was $11 and my chicken and shrimp was $15 on the lunch menu. The entire meal (no alcohol included) was $40. There are so many more affordable tasty options in this area! What a waste!!!  Now, part of the bad experience was not entirely the restaurant's fault. There were three spooky teenage boys at our table that were looking for trouble. They were yelling at the staff and being very rude. Part of my review of two stars is because the restaurant never asked them to quiet down or leave. They were yelling at the poor lady that made our food thru the entire meal, "cook it all the way thru. don't put any spices on it. don't burn it!" Then, every few minutes, they would go stand behind people at other tables to watch how their food was prepared. Every protective bone in my body was on guard with these little punks. Why wouldn't the restaurant ask them to leave?  SO, the lady that did the tricks was very underwhelming. I am not sure if she was always this way, or just this way because of the spooky boys at our table. Either way, it was a terrible experience and I will not go back there.

Family friendly, lots of classes, clean facility, and a great room for the kids to play while you sweat. The pool facility is a fun place to play all afternoon. (pool's heated year round.)  The kid sitting is free for two hours at a time, you get free workout towels, and there are fitness instructors always around in case you want to know if you are lifting something the wrong way. There is usually plenty of room on the machines, the ab work section, and free weight section. Classes are rarely over-full as well. Sometimes it can get annoying when a big group of tween boys is using the weight room - it's difficult to tune out their banter. But it IS a family place - so they have just as much right as I do to be there. Also, if you are single, you may not enjoy all the obnoxious momsy-moms crowding the halls discussing the daily challenges of parenthood. It's a little pricey, but a great place for a family to get a workout.  Sometimes, it feels a little too much like that movie "Pleasantville", but I'd take it over a meat market disguised as a workout facility any day of the week.  Before this membership, I was at LA Fitness - totally different scene - I am glad I made the move to the YMCA.

This review is specifically for Melanie's Zumba Class. The class is the most fun I have ever had working out. Women are shaking their butts, the classes are always full and everyone is having a great time. If Melanie ever leaves, I will cancel my membership!

This place is GREAT and you would never guess it from the outside! We were at the youth museum and were looking for a late lunch on a Sunday. This place was open and the yelp reviews looked pretty good!   Service was excellent! The waiter suggested the seafood enchilada or the Laos combo. We ordered both so we could sample the top picks. The plates are plentiful-  we could have easily shared one and just had a salad with it. Great fresh flavors! The fresh salsa is wonderful - smoky chipotle and not too overly oniony. The seafood enchiladas had halibut and salmon inside and fresh salsa verde over the top. So yummy! The trio/combo plate came with a choice of verde or red sauce - we went for red, which was the spicier variant -it was so good! Beef tenderlion with melty cheese stuffed crispy relleno was to die for! I could eat that every day!! The shrimp enchilada was so good that even the five year old wanted some more. I took the pork tomale home to eat for dinner - couldn't finish my plate!   They don't have a kids menu, but they do have a nice kids selection the waiter will tell you verbally. Cheese pizza, pasta or quesadilla. I think there were more offerings, but that's all the waiter could say before the 5YO made her selection.  I had the "killer margarita" (aka: the house margarita)  and was very happy with the fresh lime flavor. Sometimes, a house margarita just tastes like sweet and sour mix w/ triple sec - this one was refreshing and delish!  I would give it five stars, but there are two things lacking for a five star review: (1) the restaurant ambiance is a little underwhelming - the chairs and tables felt warn/old/cheap and you can't tell it's a great place from the outside decor. (2) food came out warm, not hot. But the flavors were so great that it won't stop us from coming back!  Fri/Sat are really busy here - the waiter said it's a really popular spot for large parties (20-40 people) - I will remember that in case we ever have a large group event!  We will definitely be back to this place! One of the BEST Mexican restaurants we've been to in the valley!

It has been three days,  two hours and 23  minutes since I was lost in my  own personal heaven at Digestif. Why personal? Because the chef made us special food that was not on the menu, and I am complete sucker for special treatment. He asked us if we wanted the warm mozzarella prepared differently from the menu...he had fresh heirloom tomatoes and amazing mozzarella from a small farm on the east coast. Warm mozzerella was draped  over sliced heirloom tomatoes and grilled breadwith a garlicky lemon vinaigrette.  The portion of mozzerella is a wonderfully glutinous amount of goodness. It was the best caprese dish I have ever had.  I drank a Brazil  66,  a  beautiful rum-citrus concoction that had a good punch without being  too strong or  too sweet.  For our second  course,  we shared Tuna Tare Tare - a generous portion of wonderfully fresh fatty tuna in a sesame sea salt  Poke-like sauce served with a yummy citrus ponzu sauce. As Jan G (Aka - the husband)  already mentioned, it was so good we had seconds....and we NEVER get seconds!  We also enjoyed salmon cake sliders and frog legs -both were wonderful, but the tuna tare tare and mozzarella stole the show....and just so you know,  the food at Digestif  is truly a production!  You can read  Jan G's review for the rest of what I was going to say. The man stole my thunder!

It's hot - the kids are wired - there is really only one solution.....the Children's museum!!! This place is great for kids under 6 years old - over six, they are probably going to like each exhibit for about two minutes. Under six, you can spend a long long time here. Start downstairs by throwing colorful scarves into vacuum pipes that climb the walls, and pop out over your heads. Watch your young ones climb thru tunnels and tents, and then cruise around on scooters for awhile. On the second floor, there's the coolest art room ever! I wish this place existed when I was little! Everyday, they paint this little playhouse a different color. It is so so cool! And there are two different art projects to try out. The facility provides aprons, and paper towels, but I would still recommend wearing something you don't mind getting a little paint or glue on. There's a kid's kitchen where they can make you pretend pizzas, and a grocery store where you can shop and ring up the food. My favorite room has walls of mazes for a ball to go thru that makes a ton of different noises. So much fun! The third floor has the funnest thing ever!! A huge room full of hanging noodles (swimming pool noodles) - and you can run thru full speed playing tag with your little ones - just keep eyes open for other little ones. I am leaving a lot out (like the toddler room), but just check this place out! It is so so nice! I think one of the coolest things is that the rooms are extremely clean - you never feel like you are picking up a book or toy covered in goobies, which I greatly appreciate. Also, don't go here if you plan to be one of those non-interactive parents. This place requires participation from both parent and child.

Cafe Monarch is more than a restaurant - it's an experience. If I had to put an analogy to this one - I would say that most restaurants are like watching a concert on tv and this place is like being in the front row at a great show. I was immersed in Christopher's beautiful world and entertained the entire time.  As Camille H mentioned, this place may not be for everyone. There is no menu provided to pick things from. This is not a place for a quick snack, although, I bet if you asked, Christopher would provide it. If you are a picky eater or have food allergies, call ahead of time. But if you go in with the mindset that you are going to be surprised with a meal full of the freshest ingredients, wonderful combinations of flavors and fantastic stories to every dish, you will not be disappointed.  I am not sure I would bring my five year old to this place. She would enjoy it, but I think my husband and I will get most out of our dining experience with a babysitter. Since Christopher is a one man show - chef, server, host, story teller, etc. etc, each course takes awhile, and my child's attention span most likely would not last through the entire meal.  For a description of the amazing food we ate, please see Camile H's review. She described everything perfectly.  This is my new favorite place in the valley. I can't wait to go back! Highly highly highly recommend this experience!!!

This place is great! It is cozy and the espresso drinks are wayyy better than "fast-food-coffee". I have been here three times. The first time, I had the pesto chicken crepe. It was so so yummy. I can't wait to go back for lunch and try it again.   This place is turning into our favorite breakfast spot on the weekends. My daughter loves the nutella crepe, and I'm a fan of nutella + strawberries. My husband ordered a savory breakfast crepe with tomatoes, mushrooms and cheese. All three were wonderful.  I only gave four stars because my favorite crepe place ever is still better...that's Ti-Couz crepes in SFO. This place is really really good, but I didn't ooh and ahh after my first bite. I guess I left my crepe heart in SFO.

I brought my four year old daughter in for her first salon hair cut. The salon is clean and beautifully decorated. All of the people that worked there were super nice. My daughter's hair cut turned our perfectly - wonderful job! I will definitely go back again.

I love this place. We order take out about once a week. The garlic chicken with vegetables is very tasty as is the Mongolian beef.  Mushu pork is good. The lunch specials are a great value. The service is very personable and sweet.  I have eaten in the place twice, and prefer take out - they do a lot of business via takeout, so there are people coming and going a lot, and the phone ringing all the time can be a bit much.

Every other Saturday, everything is 50% off! I always find great kids clothes here. Today, I got a pair of barely worn tap shoes, a barely worn pink kids leotard, some pink pants and a lovely black market white house blouse with the dry cleaning tag still on - all for $5.50!!!  Now, here's the catch - the line during the crazy saturday sale is llloooonnnnggggg! How long??? Down the hall and into the next room long. How how loonnng? 35 minutes in line long. But if you go with some friends and have fun with it - it's worth the bucks saved!

Maybe some locations just have bad kharma and are not meant to succeed....like a cold spot in a  haunted house,  this place just kind of makes me uncomfortable. Bad feng shui perhaps - or maybe it was the nasty food, drinks and slow service. I am really not sure.   When I heard the beautiful story of the chef,  taking his crew from a franchise  to his own  start-up restaurant, every dot-com bone in my  body wanted  to enjoy  this place!   The service was slow and inattentive - even  though the place was pretty empty.  Camille H did a great job of describing  our food - I,  however, would put up a good umbrella stick fight about ordering the polenta with cold shredded chicken ever again. I still have to fight the gagging reflex every time I  think of that soupy substance they tried to pass off as hummus. The ceviche was good, but the crackers  were not.  I won't go back.

The first time I went to Zwirl, I didn't think it was so bad. I was a little confused because the lady said there were 24 flavors, but I could only see about 8 that were available. I quickly figured out that they rotate flavors.  I had plain tart and my husband had peach. They were both just ok.....slightly icey, not creamy, but not over sugary either.  I decided to surprise my 4 year old daughter this week with a trip to the new fro yo shop.  It did not go well. The building smelled like a backed up toilet. I was literally gagging as we tried to get our yogurt, and then I was having bad thoughts about what could be in the yogurt if the air smelled like ass. We ate our yogurt outside. It would not be so disturbing if it were just a bad ass smell - that happens sometimes in old buildings. This was a combo of bad ass + bad/cheap cleaning products to try and cover it up. I feel nauseous just thinking about it. I think the strangest strangest part is that the girl just sat behind the counter smiling  - like nothing was wrong - maybe she was used to the smell, which makes it even worse! We will not go back!

We took our toddler to My Gym for a year when we first moved to Ahwatukee. The initial fees are high, but the classes are wonderful. All of the kids are engaged - they keep the group size small enough to keep everyone involved, but large enough where it feels like a party. We ended up cancelling our membership because they didn't have a class for older kids that fit our schedule.   We have attended two birthday parties at My Gym, and thrown a birthday party there as well. We had kids at the party ages 1- 6, and all of them had a great time. I would highly recommend this place for parties.  Favorite things about the place:  - every week, they change around the room, so it feels like a new experience - They have this cool line going across the room that kids can hang from - looks like so much fun - My toddler gained a lot of confidence in her motor skills and coordination from  this place. - All of the employees  are wonderful with kids.

YUM!!! Delish inexpensive YUM!!! My friends and I stopped here for fro yo after a yelp event. I tried coffee, pumpkin, vanilla and plain tart....all my favorites were available - how is one to choose? They were all wonderful! ahhh! If the place were  not 20 minutes away, I would get in the car right now and go for seconds!!! I ended up w/ half pumpkin and half plain covered in granola and strawberries.  YUM!!!! My friend also had a huge cup of goodness - the total cost for both our wonderful creatives was $4.25.....that place is perfect - I will go back every time I am in Scottsdale and it's open.

I have never had such a perfectly cooked steak in my entire life! This is my new favorite place in the valley!!  We started w/ the sangria-style cocktail - a yummy blend of red wine, brandy and triple sec w/ an orange rind garnish. They were potent and delish!   For starters, fois gras and mussels. The Fois Gras melted in your mouth like butter and was served w/ grilled peaches and a small piece of grilled bread - it was SO SO GOOD. One of the most wonderful things I have ever  put in my mouth! The mussels were amazing as well, served in a simple thick pernod lemon butter with leeks. They brought us bread so we could enjoy every bit of the broth.  For entrees, we had steak frite and duck confit. The duck was cooked to perfection, falling off the bone with crispy skin and a perfect amount of sauce and vegie medley The steak frite was to-die-for - medium rare was perfectly red - every bite melted in my mouth - it was truly heavenly.  For desert, we had the chocolate creme brulee - it was perfectly caramelized over the entire surface! As a creme brulee connoisseur, I can tell you that nothing is more disappointing than a half-assed caramelized top - this one set a new standard for how creme brulee should be done!  You definitely want to make a reservation for this place - it's a tiny little cozy room with a bar and lots of tiny tables. It was cramped, but I never felt like I didn't have enough space. This is not a superficial spot - people were dressed casually and everyone in the place was having a great time. This is not a place to eat with children, but fantastic for a date night.   HIGHLY recommend this place!!! Great food, great service, great atmosphere!!!! TEN STARS!!

I am from Santa Cruz, CA and this place is a taste of home. When my cousin, who used to be a bartender at the Santa Cruz local, told me they were opening a place in Phoenix, I was SO HAPPY!!!  My favorite things are the Poke appetizer (seriously the BEST EVER), sweet potato friends, fish cakes, and DR FUNK! I could drink Dr. Funks all day long - nothing but coconut pineapple cocktail goodness! I could swim in that stuff it tastes so good. In fact, that's what I want for my birthday - a kiddie pool filled with Dr. Funk!  On the Santa Cruz menu, they have beef satay and ahi rice bowls that are amazing - I wish they were on this menu as well.  The ambiance is more "posh" than the Santa Cruz restaurant. I love the outdoor patio -it may be one of the prettiest I've seen in town.   I will go back to this place every time I miss home.

THIS PLACE USED TO BE CALLED BUFFALO KIDS!!!  This is a wonderful gently used kids clothing store that only caries the best of the best used clothes! They are extremely selective! I brought in a bunch of stuff for trade, thinking that all my beautiful pieces were exactly what they wanted. They only chose two items that were worn twice! Quality and selection are always the best here. You pay about $2 premium over other resellers, but I like to think of it as a service charge for the work they do to filter out all the ugly used clothes. Some of my daughter's favorite pieces are from here. :)

This was my first experience was HOT yoga and I LOVED it. You should know that I hate saunas - longest time in a sauna ever was about 30 seconds. But I love a good masochistic workout, so I really wanted to try this.  First of all, about the facility. I have done yoga in many studios and love my classes at the YMCA in Ahwatukee. This yoga studio is so so beautiful! The space is open, inviting, relaxing, and extremely clean. The hot room has ceiling fans, and when it gets too warm, the instructor opens the doors to let cool air in. Even with all the bodies in the room, there was NO stinkiness!! This was always my biggest fear about hot yoga.   I wore capri yoga pants and a yoga top. I brought a full length towel, huge bottle of water and a yoga mat. The instructor placed me close to the door in case I needed to cool down. The class pace was perfect - flowing from one pose to the next. There was wonderful non-new-agemusic playing on a great sound system the whole time. The posture instructions were clear and easy to follow, however, I think it would be difficult for a beginner. It could be that the instructor knew there were no beginners, and therefore, didn't go slow. I had to stop three times towards the end of the class. I was too hot and my heart was beating too fast. After a three minute break (still in the room) and some water, I could finish with the class. My mat, clothes and towel were completely wet - I'm not talking damp - I mean WET. I highly recommend bringing an extra change of clothes for after class  and wearing as little clothing as respectably possible in the class!  The class costs $16 for an individual session, or $20 for two classes (two weeks in a row). They have a ton of different class purchase plans available with varying discount levels, depending on how many sessions you purchase. I don't see myself doing this regularly, but LOVED the experience and highly recommend this facility!

I used to go home to Santa Cruz all the time and party with my friends. Then, on one trip, all my friends were busy. They were all at CROSSFIT on party nights! The second time I went home, I started to notice incredible physical changes in my fellow party animals. One guy that had a beer gut was ripped with a six pack and huge guns.  Once again, no one wanted to party because they didn't want to screw up their crossfit routines.  I had to find out what could possibly be better than partying with my friends. That's when I found Tribal Crossfit.   I saw an ad to try out a session and see if I liked it. Jake and I set up a time, and I met him in the gym - a warehouse/huge garage fitted with free weights, wooden boxes, and bars with long rubber things hanging down. Jake taught me about the importance of good form and basic technique for pushups, squats and pull-ups. He gave suggestions on balance, foot placement, breathing, and I was blown away at how well he could identify my body's weaknesses and strengths. After about half an hour of this, I thought the intro was over and I said "Thanks" thinking it was time to leave. Then Jake got a big grin on his face, and said, "That was the warm up." I thought he was kidding at first, but quickly realized this was no joke.  He said, "Most people's work out is our warm up."  I proceeded to do 25 squats, 12 pushups and 7 pull ups - over and over again. (I don't remember how many times - this was awhile ago.)   I came home thinking that all my friends back home were nuts. Why would anyone put themselves through this on purpose? I was sore for five days strait and could barely climb stairs or reach the tall cabinets in the kitchen. I decided to wait awhile since the holidays were coming and I wasn't sure how often I would be able to go.  After the holidays, my husband tried it, and became addicted immediately. He was only sore for two days after his first session. I am still a little pissed about that. I joined about two weeks later.  Here's what I love about crossfit: every class is different and a challenge, most sessions have a timed activity which feels wonderfully competitive and pushes you a little further, I leave class feeling completely alive and de-stressed, and now, if I go a couple days without a little muscle pain, I feel the need to workout harder. I haven't been in the class long enough to see huge physical differences yet, but I feel more alive than I ever have in my life.  My friends back home gave some good advice on finding the right crossfit gym, and I am lucky I found Jake at Tribal Crossfit because he meets the criteria. Good form is really important - you want to make sure you have an instructor that is emphasizing good form over increasing weight, or you could get hurt.  Jake knows the human body so well - in the last four weeks, I've had a few aches and pains. As soon as I point them out, he is able to show me how to adjust the move to stop the pain.   The class is a pricey. But if you think of how much it would cost to have a private trainer three - six hours a week, this is a bargain!  I HIGHLY recommend Tribal Crossfit!

Oh Zoyo!! You are way too close to my house, and I am forced to visit you often and much. I am so happy you are here!!!! There is always plain tart - it's a little sweeter than Mojo's, but still wonderful! And the toppings assortment is heavenly- fresh strawberries, blueberries, kiwi, coconut, granola, all the candy choices and nutty nuts. OH - and $0.35/oz? Thank you for being here!!!  Two requests: 1. More seats please 2. If you stamp my card, don't restamp the same spots - because I'm counting, and such consistent naughtiness will lead to a bad review.

On my last visit, I noticed they DID add more seats! Fantastic!!!  AND they didn't double punch the frequent visitor card.  The Fruit Punch Tart flavor is delish!!!  My new favorite spot.

I attended a baby shower that was catered by the Herb Box. I knew it was going to be good - when we pulled up and saw the Herb Box vehicle, all my friends in the car started oohing and ahhing about the food we were about to eat.   The food was displayed so beautifully - it looked like a feast for kings and queens. So so pretty!  There were two different kinds of wraps, plantain chips w/ this amazing creamy crab dip, the most wonderful sundried tomato spread on crispy crostinis, and yummy mixed green salad. Everything tasted amazing. I am not a fan of sundried tomatoes, but that spread was so good - I wish I had the recipe!  If I ever need catering, I will definitely use this company!

You can get a better cake at Safeway for half the price (and I am not really a big fan of Safeway cake, but you get my point).  This place is a joke - don't believe the hype. Stay away from the overly-sugary nasty baked thing that does not deserve to be called 'cake'. Don't eat the free tasters, don't fall for the packaging and the fancy looking bakery. If you are this desperate for cake, seriously, just go to Safeway.
