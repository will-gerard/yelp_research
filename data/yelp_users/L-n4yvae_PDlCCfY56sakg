This is a fair airport; it's old, the security moves at medium speed, the food is not very good.  As large airports go, it's just older and grosser than most.  Its poorly lit and feels "sweaty."  I would give it 1 star for the airport and 1 star for the free wifi.  It needs an update, which I think is coming, as they are collecting survey data right now to that end.  Please complete the survey an tell them to make it like MSP's new terminal!

PHOENIX: This Hertz is good; they have a ton of cars, plenty o upgrades, and a big, cushy rental car center.  No complaints.  I had an issue once with a car that had expired tags, and they were good about it and gave me a $100 voucher for my troubles.  Join Gold Club so you can get fast cars and discounted pricing.

PHOENIX, AZ: Just come here to see Heber Hernandez, if you can get him.  My hair is impossible to cut well and he knocked it out like it was nothing.  The guy should be charging $50 for picking up the shears.

PHOENIX, AZ: Just finished a pleasant brunch at First Watch.  The cute little cafe serves fresh breakfast/lunch fare and has some nice options.  I had the eggs Benedict with ham, tomato and added avocado.  It was a 3-4 star experience.  The toast was a little burnt and the ham was a little overpowering.  Otherwise it was good.  I also tried the sourdough French toast and it was Excellent-5 stars.  Delicious berry sauce, cinnamon accents, and fresh butter.  It was wonderful and highly recommended.

TEMPE, AZ: Four Peaks is the most reviewed, most revered destination restaurant by anyone needing a watering hole in Phoenix (and by the way, everyone in Phoenix needs a watering hole).  I tried two things from the late night menu that are most famous.  Ambience and Service(4 star): They were very friendly and very chill, typical for a good bar.  The beer operation is mighty in here and you can see it behind the bar.  Lots of tables and patio dining.  Very low key, very casual.  FOOD  Chicken Rolls (5+ stars): Unbelievable.  Like an amazing spring roll with warm spiced finely shredded chicken and cream cheese on the interior, served with a sweet jalapeño cream dipping sauce.  I could feel the dopamine surging in my happy brain with every bite.  Nachos (5 star): Also awesome, these nachos have been ranked as among the "Top 20" Nachos in the United States.  They are made by the blackened chicken they put all over them.  It's moist, delicious, and tender with a lot of flavor, packed with the abundant cheese and beans/jalapeños/cream on the side to keep the integrity of the nachos until you pour it all over the top.  Head on over!

I was excited to review this place because of the polar opposite reviews I had read and how old and famous the place is!  I went with a big group, so I had the chance to see many menu items plated and try more than one dish.  Ambience: Very kitschy and dark, lots of old photos and vintage cans, signs & baskets.  Equal parts fun and tacky.  Drinks: Free bottomless house wine.  Not a drinker, but apparently its passable but no memorable.  Service: not friendly, just efficient.  Not super helpful either.  Salad: (included with the meal) 2 stars, boring, lightly vinaigretted greens with a chunk of cheese and a slice of pastrami.  Garlic Bread: (included) Superb, 4 stars.  Warm, fresh, crispy and soft.  Chicken Alfredo (entree): 3 stars. The sauce was fine, the grilled chicken was good.  Filet Mignon: (entree) 1 star.  I eat steak all the time, this was awful: tasteless, under cooked, & dry.  It's hard to mess up a piece of meat but Battistas has done it.  Almost identical to the memorable time I ordered steak at an Applebee's in 2006.  That bad.  Manicotti: (entree) 2 stars, the cheese was fine, but not much taste, and the sauce was pretty boring, kinda sweet.  Just bland overall.  Cappuccino: (included) was really just hot chocolate with whipped cream.  Good, but not what you expect.  Spumoni Dessert: 3 stars, it was tasty layered ice cream.  Can't mess it up, delicious and recommended.  Tiramisu: overstrong flavor, but it looks pretty.  I can't rate it with justice because I don't like tiramisu.  Most at the table did not eat much of it.

LAS VEGAS: Had lunch here with a business associate and it was really good.  The ambience is stellar and its a great place for all the locals to go who want a terrific lunch off the strip.    FOOD  Crab Cakes (5 stars): These were totally delicious.  Big crab cakes with two delicious and unexpected sauces.  One was honey mustard.  They rocked.  Mediterranean Salad (3 stars):  it was pretty good; not really good but pretty good.  I might try something else next time but wouldn't mind ordering it again either.  Swordfish Steak (4 stars):  This was quite good, atop tasty mashed potatoes.  Not five stars but it was a good entree.

Review for Stylist named Sheryl: I went to this little location off the stop for a haircut.  The stylist, Sheryl, was AWESOME.  She taught me all about Vegas, about the on strip/off strip culture, and the economy, all if which are topics I did interesting and in which she was well versed.  Gave me counseling about proper hair care for my hair type and recommended great products.  Docked one star because the location was outdated and a little tired.  They need to update it.

PHOENIX: this is officially the closest gas station to PHX airport rental car return!  For this reason I give it two stars.  Otherwise it is just a crummy little gas station with outdated pumps, lousy drink selection, lousy candy selection, lousy food selection, and a terrific selection of indecent men's magazines.

TEMPE, AZ: Excellent Theater; this was a lot of fun to visit.  A few notes:  1. Not reserved seating, so arrive early 2. The theaters are huge, and the sound is great 3. The food is just usual theater food, nothing fancy 4. I would rate the "mall rat" level at moderate 5. $9.50 standard ticket

SCOTTSDALE, AZ: (how to have a 5-star experience at this 3.5-star restaurant).  I love Sushi Brokers.  I get the same thing every time and am always delighted:   ***!!!*** The Surfer Roll  ***!!!***  The menu might as well have exactly one item on it.  (Maybe two, if you add the tempura combo, which is also good.)  The surfer roll is a tasty tuna and avocado sushi roll topped with a dynamite hot and spicy mayo basted array of shrimp tails and crab!  It is absolutely delicious and the most guilty-pleasure sushi I have anywhere in the country.  I look forward to it every time I am in Phoenix.  You must try it before judging this restaurant.  The rest of the menu may be lackluster, but I wouldn't know it.  Just order this and you will be a happy sumo.

I went to see Terry on a company trip to Vegas.  The show was fantastic: it was hilarious, was jaw droppingly executed, was relatively clean and inoffensive, and had a pretty good pace.  I laughed so hard I cried a couple times at the cowboy, the cougar, and the pot smoking dummy.  I hope Terry keeps updating his show with these heavy personality dummies.  The only complaint with the show is that Terry sang three of his own songs.  I want to be sensitive here: the songs were filled with heart, had a wonderful message, and earn money for charity.  How could I say anything negative?  They just didn't fit the show very well: for example, we were laughing our guts out and then he would start singing about cancer and little boys who ride horses when they die.  The song didn't work-at all-and was uncomfortable.  Everything else was perfect!  Highly recommended show!  Will come back with my wife.

TEMPE, AZ: (Happy Hour Review) I was just pleasantly surprised by a wonderful Happy Hour here at the Keg in Tempe!  I came in with average expectations and was totally impressed during my visit.  I was with some wonderful business associates who frequent this place and were helpful in guiding to the best options.  Ambience: (4 stars): Its a current, updated look with some high back booths and dim lighting.  It's a cool atmosphere and a little loud.  Formal enough but not stuffy.  Service: (4 stars): The waitress was very nice, did a pretty good job keeping drinks full and was very sweet.  All smiles and friendly.  FOOD: Happy hour menu, tried a few things:  Prime Rib Sliders (5 stars): These were awesome!  The meat was extremely tender and thick sliced.  They were very flavorful and crusted in black pepper.  The sliders were served with a Dijon-horseradish aoli and were just wonderful.  Could have eaten them all night.  On a soft roll, too, which was fresh and dense enough.    Keg Sliders (4.5 stars): These were delicious too!  Soft, tender meat that bit away immediately with each bite, even though from the grilled look of them it seemed like I would have to dig in a little.    Scallops with Bacon (4 stars): You get three skewers, each with bacon and scallops.  The scallops are small but taste great and are a nice pairing with the bacon.    Shrimp Cocktail (4 stars): Jumbo shrimp, well prepared, with a spicy, aromatic cocktail sauce.  They were delicious, even though I don't normally order cocktails.  I highly enjoyed them.  Go give them a try!

PHOENIX, AZ: This is a lovely convention hotel.  The room bathrooms leave a little to be desired, but overall the look, the cleanliness and upgraded amenities, and the top of line facilities make it a safe stay and a good option or a Phoenix convention destination.

This is a nice place to come for a meal.  I gave it four stars because it still feels like a big, well executed chain, like Cheesecake Factory (its owners), and the menu is so big that there are apparently several very average things you can order.  I was able to order well by reading previous reviews, so here are the menu items i experienced (below).  It is big, opulent, and modern, with mildly attentive service.  Asian Nachos: 5 stars, my favorite part of the meal.  Peanut ginger glaze, fried wontons, wasabi cream and mozzarella.  Full of delicious flavor, we nearly licked the plate.  Short Rib Grilled Cheese: 4 stars, moist meat with horseradish cream sauce.  The bread was toasted pretty crispy, the cheese was good.  Included was a house salad; the blue cheese dressing I ordered was good.  Turkey Sandwich: 3 stars, my friend got it and the thick baguette it was served on was too thick and too toasted, making it hard to bite into.

LAS VEGAS, ENCORE HOTEL: Like anything at the Encore, every business is a palatial experience.  Wazuzu has a $1M crystal dragon adorning a wall and there are only maybe 15 tables in the whole restaurant.  Amazing decor.  Food is overpriced and not super good.  I give it four stars instead of three because of decor and the curry dish, otherwise it's a very three star experience and two star value.  Have tried three items:  Roti Panang Starter (5 stars/$12): Delicious!  Like a combination between traditional yellow curry and a Thai coconut milk Tom Ka Gai soup.  Neat, warm slices of naan-like flatbread to accompany.  Drunken Noodles (3.5 star/$24) This dish is overhyped.  Spicy and sweet, it is good but not something to rave about.  Lobster Roll (3 star): Again, at $30 this roll better be amazing, and it's not amazing, it's just a good, quality-prepared, but generic-tasting, boring sushi roll that doesn't have much flavor or pizzazz.  I just get the feeling this restaurant is going through the motions a little bit.

PHOENIX GATES ONLY: Okay, so I like Delta as an airline pretty well.  I am Platinum with them, but I'm not reviewing Delta corporate in this review.  Im just reviewing Delta's gates here in PHX.  Also, disclaimer, this isn't a "grumpy" review, the service is fine and Im not mad at anyone, this is data driven around the comparative offerings. (Delta operates about 5-6 gates here in PHX). The situation is not good:  - One restroom with a tiny entrance and exit, always crowded in there and you bump elbows coming in/out - Food: Wendy's and a tired "Cantina" - No bookstore - No soda stop/drink stop - No coffee store - No bakery - Gross worn out carpets - Crowded wait areas with few seats - 2 charging stations per gate (I counted them; it only took a moment to double check)  Delta, when you get a minute, would you pretty please update your gate area here in PHX, to the extent you are able?  Thanks, Lee

LAS VEGAS: Absolutely epic meal.  I dine all over the country, and this is one of my top five picks anywhere, which is saying something for being on the strip.  Some people have mixed experience, but here is mine:  The poached egg with truffle shavings was marvelous, the highlight of my night.  Perfectly cooked egg, crostini spears, and an appropriate and generous portion of truffle shavings on top.  WONDERFUL, complex, flavorful and rich.  Next was the Foie gras, best I have had, because it was paired with this chewy, spongy, delicately toasted, thick, buttery Texas toast bread that was to die for.  That-with the smooth richness of the Foie gras-was superb.  I followed it up with scallops that were perfect.  They didn't have any surprises, but were simply perfectly executed scallops, which is a feat of its own.  I am so eager to return.

PHOENIX: Tommy V's is a cool, old fashioned-feeling little Phoenix pizza joint with good food and service in a relaxed setting.  Service and Ambience (4 stars): The walls and floors are worn wood and brick, with black and white photos of old actors and actresses.  The waitstaff is black clad and high service; they took care of us.  FOOD  Bread (4 stars): The bread was fresh and served with a delicious herb butter.  Great way to start the meal.  Caprese Salad (4 stars): Delicious mozzarella and tomatoes were pretty flavorful, well seasoned and well portioned.  Cuatro Carne Pizza (3.5 stars): This was a pretty good pizza, but as with many of these Naples types, the center got soggy and the edges were slightly burnt.  I know that's sort of the style, it just wasn't amazing.  It was "good" with no adjective to amplify it.

PHOENIX: This Aloft is great; these are my go-to hotels in any city, and this one is consistent with the rest.  Clean, comfortable, groovy.  They are design forward; makes other hotels seem boring and dated by comparison.  The parking is the only challenge, just a flat lot around the hotel, so come early.

LAS VEGAS: This hertz center is pretty nice; they always have a lot of cars and the upgrades are pretty good.  The rent a car center is big and remote to the airport, which is annoying if you are in a hurry.  Who's in a hurry to leave Vegas though? (I guess if you're being chased by a loan shark)

LAS VEGAS, NV, WORLD TRADE CENTER: Stopped in to Mundo to rest my feet a bit after plowing through xteen levels of the furniture show.  Had the stuffed chile Relleno.  It was flavorful, rich, and with abundant chile.  It was a sautéed dish, more than a dry dish, which was untraditional.  The churro dessert was awesome as well.

SCOTTSDALE: Seasons 52 is a terrific chain with healthy items and local fare.  It mostly packs a lot of flavor within those right restrictions.  The ambience is modern, geometric and a little on the formal side.  It was perfect for a lunch with business associates.  FOOD  Caramelized Scallops (5 stars): These were a very generous serving of scallops; they have quite a few.  Well prepared and served atop asparagus and risotto.   Lobster Flatbread (4 stars): Flatbread is more like a cracker than a "bread" and the taste is good, but toppings are a little less plentiful than you might hope.  Fish Tacos (3 stars): These were good, but a little dry and could use more flavor.  The burger looked a little on the weak side as well, but I didn't try it.

SCOTTSDALE: Had the chance to stop in at the most popular restaurant in this sun-drenched millionaire metropolis and I was blown away.  Ambience and service (5 stars): The look is a little formal with white linens, candles and low lighting, but it is offset by very casual, approachable waitstaff and loud, jazzy, mid-century piano jam music.  FOOD:   Pork Belly Pastrami (5+ Stars/$13) Ahhhhmazing!  Order it: aromatic, flavorful in the extreme with a sweet pork/bacon taste  Scallops Atop Corn Gratin Purée (5 stars/$29): This was outstanding.  The smooth purée balanced the scallops wonderfully.  Lots of flavor, complexity and balance.  PB&B Pudding (4.5 stars/$10): This is delicious, smooth vanilla pudding, banana and caramel with peanut butter cookie spears.  I am already looking forward to being hungry again for my return!

PHOENIX, AZ: Came into town late and arrived just before the kitchen closed.  They were super gracious to whet my appetite with some of their best and well-reviewed fare.    The ambience is cool and very new American (high tables, wood tones, creative understated lighting, music is groovy and a little louder, very casual, a lot of beards eating here).  Tried two server recommendations: the pretzel and the fish tacos.  Pretzels (4.5 stars):  These were very good, among the best pretzels I've had.  The plating was done artistically, the pretzels were soft and spongy, and the dipping cheese and mustard were flavorful.    Guppy Fish Tacos: (5 stars) Outstanding!  Huge fish portions that were fresh and delicious, spicy aoli, excellent guacamole, wonderful salsa.  Every element was right on for these tacos and I enjoyed them tremendously.  The service, ambience and food were excellent on this visit, five stars.

LAS VEGAS, NV: This restaurant is significantly underrated at 3 stars.  Haters gonna hate.  The food was excellent.  Service needed work, otherwise I would give 5 stars.  Eat here.  Tried a bunch of awesome menu items:  Fish n Chips (4.5 stars): Delicious English fish n chips, soft, tender fish with a flavorful crisp exterior.    Steak Tenderloin (5 stars): Tender, delicious, perfectly cooked.  It was a wonderful dish!  Lobster Roll (4 stars): Delicious, flavorful, pretty good size for a starter.

PHOENIX, AZ: Is sushi brokers the best sushi in Phoenix?  Probably not.  Is it my favorite sushi in Phoenix?  Oh yeah!  There is a ton of flavor, groovy music, nice decor and friendly service.  It's a great place for a business meeting or to hang out for happy hour.  Order the surfer roll; probably my most favorite guilty pleasure sushi ever.  The lollipop roll is also a clever take with a cucumber exterior and the rolls are on skewers.

PHOENIX, AZ: Had a wonderful lunch today at this trendy food stop for the local white collar crowd.  It was buzzing at lunch time with their signature light fare and new-American preparation.  I tried a couple of items:  1. Signature Chop Salad: (5 stars) The hype is well earned; this salad is complex, delicious, and not overbearing.  There is a lot going on between the pumpkin seeds, quinoa, delicious dressing and greens. I Facebook friended it after the meal (this salad actually has its own Facebook page)  2. Brussels Sprouts Appetizer (5 stars): Again, these were awesome.  Not fried like I typically find, or heavily infused with meat, they were truffle-oiled and served on a corn purée.  Eager to return!

LAS VEGAS: Prepare to be treated like royalty when you come into this excellent sushi spot; the most yelped about in Las Vegas.  I read about it and came in, and was surprised to be treated non-pretentiously, comfortably, and with a very welcoming vibe.  The servers were having fun being here and were super nice to everyone.  Like I was stepping into the Cheers bar.  Thanks guys!  Yellowtail Yozu Soy (4stars/$12) Beautiful and delicious, mild soy and citrus with a spicy kick.  Cajun Albacore Sashimi (5 star/$5 HH menu): This beautiful dish packs a punch! Smooth fish with healthy spice, delicious sauce.  Tostadas ($4 for 4): The Tuna tostada is 5 stars.  The other three (Tako, Salmon, Hamachi) are 3-4 stars each.  Hydro Bibb Black Cod (5 stars/$4 HH):  Awesome!  Warm marinated cod on crisp green lettuce.  A little tempura topping for additional texture.  Buy this.  Green Tea Tiramisu (4 stars/$7): Really smooth, really creamy, moist, firm cake.  Very light flavor.

Poorly laid out, poorly organized, inefficient, lousy attention to us-their clients-and overall a typical bad security experience.  No worries, though, TSA is pretty similar at most airports.  2 stars for having TSA Pre-check!

LAS VEGAS, NV: Casino review only.  I did not stay here.  The casino floor is clean and newly renovated.  Some have complained that it seems a bit reshuffled from the old Sahara, but I think the updated design and clean smell and new infrastructure are modern, well designed, and alluring.  The biggest complaint is that the property is relatively new and doesn't have a ton of traffic.  The restaurant by Andres is amazing, the casino is nice, the service seems okay, but there aren't many people here so you don't get a vibe of it being a "popular" place.  The crowd looked nice, though, and I'm sure it will pick up.  I would give them a try for a hotel stay as well.

First time visitor, had heard a lot of positive things.  First, the ambience is very hip; from the separate sitting areas (bar, coffee area, dining area, patio) that each have some different decor to the funky framed art on the wall, it feels current.  The menu is diverse but not overwhelming, and there are some creative dishes and drinks, including some fun mocktails for the lunch crowd.  I ordered the recommended chai lime ginger beer (4 stars) and it was good: slightly bitter and sweet and the chai flavored undercurrent was a nice mixture with the ginger.  Yum.  Next we ordered the "popovers" (3.5 stars)  I'm still not sure if that is a made-up dish or something that is real, but I've never seen a "popover" in my life before now.  It is basically a bread roll with the consistency of a soufflé and is airy and mostly hollow on the inside, almost like a billowy pizza crust, with two really fancy butters: ham butter and chive butter.  It was all good; I surprised myself by preferring the chive to the ham butter.  I wish the popovers were a little more substantial on the inside; it was hard to spread butter within them because they were so hollow.  Entrees:  Fried Chicken Sandwich (3.5 stars): This was a good but not epic sandwich.  The chicken was moist, the toppings were fresh, but the sandwich didn't have enough sauce and flavor to blow me away.  If you like milder fare, this is probably a good choice.  Quinoa Tacos (3 stars): These were also good considering they were vegetarian, but will not rival a full-meat competitor: creatively served, tasty and light, but lacking the punch, smoke, and sizzle of a meaty alternative.  Cauliflower Polenta (4 stars): This is not the polenta I am used to, all rolled together in a big disc with sauce atop it, but is instead flavorful roasted cauliflower blended with polenta, almost like a couscous.  I loved it and are every bite.  Yum!  Bread Pudding (3.5 stars):  Moist, with caramel ice cream, and warm, this is a well prepared bread pudding.  It had a lot of raisins on it which had plumped up in the oven and in the moist trappings, but they were overwhelming to me.  Better if some banana caramel sauce were there instead of the raisins, then it could be a five star dish.

PHOENIX AIRPORT:  What a surprise at the airport; a delicious new American option with an innovative menu.  The ambience and service were both great and there were a ton of attractive items on the menu.  Tried a few menu items:  Pâté (3.5 stars): This was fine; it ha a pretty light flavor and was dense.  It leaned a little much on the bologna side of the spectrum.  Gruyere Burger (4 stars): This burger was really good; thick patty, dense eggy homemade bun, and melted cheese with a hint of truffle.  The fries were okay as well.

LAS VEGAS, NV: This is a wonderful restaurant, with some fantastic dishes.  The decor is eccentric and the service is good.  We ordered a lot of items, rated below:  - Suckling Pig (4.5 stars): This is what they are known for, and it is a completely unique dish; unlike any pork I've ever had.  The outer skin is crisp and caramelized, and underneath this thin veneer is a layer of fatty, tender, flavorful meat.  Two of our group loved it, one thought it was a bit too fatty.  - Carpaccio on a stick - (5+ stars): The highlight of the evening for two of our party and loved by all of us.  Absolutely amazing warm dipping foam sauce.  Please order this.  We were all fighting over the last one.  - Classic Beef Tartare: (5+ stars): the favorite dish of one of our party, it is outstanding.  Diced cubes of beef tartare, egg yolk, spice, mustard.  Amazing!  - Cotton Candy Foie Gras (4 stars): Loved by two of our group, one thought it was okay.  Sweet Foie gras surrounded by cotton candy.  - Chicken Croquettes (4.5 stars): Delicious, warm, great for sharing, enjoyed by all  - Pillin Peppers (4 stars): flavorful and spicy, served flat in marinade, enjoyed by all, one said just good not great  - Cauliflower (4 stars): Delicious, aromatic, roasted cauliflower in a pine nut reduction.  Awesome  - Roubuchon Potatoes (4.5 stars): one of our party said they were the best he's ever had.  Everyone enjoyed, one commented that there wasn't much flavor, just perfectly executed potatoes.  -

TEMPE, AZ: Came in today for some Culinary Dropout fare and was impressed!  The room is busy, the waitstaff was knowledgeable, the food was good.  They have a game area in the back and bring in live music as well.  We tried the Pretzels (4 stars), like big, salty, bready, soft doughnut holes.  The dipping cheese fondue was excellent.  Also enjoyed the charcuterie plate (4.5 stars); had the prosciutto, goat cheese, and fig bar.  It was delicious as well.  Great place, excited to return and try more!
