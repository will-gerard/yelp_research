The owner was running the show when we had dinner there on a Wednesday evening. Had the Calamari as an appetizer and it was really good. The lemon orzo soup was a nice touch. Wife had the gyro platter which was really good. I had the snapper special and I thought it was a little too salty.  Overall, the food was very good, although service was a bit slow.

This place is pretty close to where I live, so I've been there a few times. And every time I come away feeling the same way: the food is decent, but it's overpriced and the service is sub par. They make a good Cobb salad, which is usually what I get. But for $12, you can do a lot better somewhere else.

Love Dutch Bros! I go there so often they just make my drink when they see me pull up. Large hot White Russian. Sometimes I get it with cinnamon mixed in (fireball shots) tastes great.

Love this place for tacos, beer and a huge variety of different salsas! If you're looking for good tacos in Phoenix, you should definitely try La Santisima.

Really good Italian food. The seafood selection is fresh and delicious. My wife had the seafood Principessa and I had the fresh clams on Linguini. Didn't go five stars just because the service was a little slow, but the food makes it totally worthwhile.

Great food and drinks as well as a fun family friendly atmosphere. Went with a group of friends on a Sunday afternoon and really enjoyed it. Plan to go back with the wife and kids in the near future.
