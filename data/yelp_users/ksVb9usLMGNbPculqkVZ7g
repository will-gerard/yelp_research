I live right near here, and I've always been skeptical of it because of the shopping center it is in. Tonight I decided to give it a try and I was very impressed! The inside was much nicer than I had expected, with wooden tables and mellow lighting. I got the soba noodle soup with chicken; it was superb! The soba noodles there are made of 100% buckwheat. My friend got the vegetable and tofu ramen, which was equally delicious! The broth was light in color with a hint of spice.  Each dish that passed us on the way to their orderers turned our heads, and we found ourselves repeating "oh I want to try that next time I come!" Therefore, I can say with certainty that I will return!

The patio was perfect for a beautiful October brunch. I got a turkey sandwich and tomato soup for about $11. I loved that it came out in a picnic basket! Quite the enjoyable meal, I look forward to returning!

I was overcome with nostalgia for my hometown (Richmond, VA) upon entering this bar. It is dimly lit, with a cool and casual crowd. The band playing on this particular Friday night was unique: a girl with a violin, a guy with some bongos, and I believe a guy on a keyboard.   Let me tell you something. If you get a chance to go here, do yourself a favor and get the nachos. They were so incredibly good. I couldn't even tell you why, but I can tell you that my friend decided to stop eating them about half way through, and it took everything in me to put a napkin over the last 5-10 chips to stop myself from eating every last bite. So good, outrageous good!

Fancy restaurant, with a novel idea. I enjoyed seeing the sunset with my friends during a birthday party. The prickly pear margarita was delicious, but I wouldn't have been able to afford more than one or two! I got the chicken flatbread appetizer as an entree and it was much bigger than any of my friends' entrees. I thorougly enjoyed it: large chunks of cheese and chicken, very flavorful, and enough for two full meals. Can't beat that!

I really enjoyed my brunch here this morning. My party of 2 was seated immediately at noon on a Sunday, but at the bar between two people (not a problem for us). Definitely a dive bar feel, with a friendly vibe. The $5 mimosa was poured strong and with pulp, just how I like it. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because I wasn't overly impressed with their food. Nothing wrong with it, but I wasn't tempted to lick the plate or anything...

I was pleasantly surprised by karaoke night at Monkey Pants. The decor on the inside is certainly not what I'd expected from a bar in a shopping strip. I found the atmosphere unique, with hints of hipster. Everyone was totally vibing on the karaoke, people were just singing their little hearts out! Loved it.

Impressive. I came here for brunch on a Sunday and decided to go healthy with the Turkey Sausage White Out. It was delicious. The meal was a turkey sausage egg white omelet with fresh fruit and toast on the side. The rye bread was a bit stale, but that is my only complaint about the meal. The fruit cup was large and had quite a bit of pineapple in it. Some of my friends got pancakes, and boy was I jealous! Next time I go, I don't think I'll plan on a healthy meal ;)

As a healthcare provider (RN/ BSN) who has worked in five different hospitals across the United States (VA, CO, and AZ), I would vehemently recommend avoiding this For-Profit practice at all cost. If you are not interested in reading the details to follow, here is my main point: they use emotional manipulation and mind games to exploit worried patients.  If you are interested in details, here goes... I went into Camelback Health Care for my annual gyn appointment. They performed an STD blood test and a pap smear. They called me a few days later and told me that they would recommend a follow up appointment, but could not tell me whether I had abnormal or normal results (I realize some people believe this is a HIPAA issue, but it wasn't as I signed waivers allowing detailed info over the phone). I told them I am not interested in coming in if my results are normal, yet they still wouldn't tell me.  Fast forward after a few more phone calls and me finally requesting to speak with a manager. After getting a bit more adamant and explaining that I got tested for all sorts of STDs, including HIV, and I am very concerned about my health, she told me that my STD test was completely normal, but could not confirm or deny that my pap was normal. I told her I will not be scheduling a follow up appointment until I get my pap results.  Fast forward a week, they called and told me that my pap was abnormal, but wouldn't tell me what type of abnormality I had. I told them that I am a nurse and I would like to know more details. Finally, I went in to the clinic and demanded my lab results, which they did print out for me without a fuss (although on the phone they told me that they wouldn't).   My personal opinion is that they are using these tactics, knowing full well that vast majority of patients will be scared and will come in and spend more money on follow up appointments. I will be taking my lab results to a new healthcare provider and ask them for their opinion. I won't be donating another dime to Camelback Health Care.

I've been here for the sunset twice now, and was very impressed both times. You can park and walk up to the top and through the hole in just a few minutes. It's an easy hike, I did it easily in fashion boots. If you're looking for an easily accessible, great view of the sunset, this is definitely your spot! Can't wait to go back :)

I now understand why it's called Hula's MODERN Tiki. It definitely has a trendy air to it. I enjoyed the atmosphere, and the large lunch portions. I got a fish sandwich with a side salad. The salad was surprisingly delicious, basically greens and sesame seeds with a citrus dressing. The fish sandwich was good, as expected. The bread was fantastic! I'd definitely like to come back for a happy hour experience :)

The reason this restaurant deserves a 1 in my book, is because they charged an $8 tip to my credit card, when I only tipped $3 (on a $13 tab). CapitalOne alerted me about the "very generous tip," so I called the restaurant. The person who answered gave me the name (Mark) and number of the manager, but he did not pick up or call back.  CapitalOne erased the charge, so we're all good on my end, but these jerks still got an extra $5, because CapitalOne said it'd cost more money to try to fight them, than to just credit me the $5. I would be willing to bet that this restaurant is well aware of that, and that this is not an isolated incident. If the restaurant had answered, or appeared to care even a little bit about the wrongful charge, they probably would have gotten a 3 star rating.

If you want to come to a somewhat classier, yet huge sports bar with TVs all over, this is your place. I came on a Wednesday for happy hour, and it was not particularly crowded, which was nice. Easily found a spot for two at the bar. Happy hour deals were ok, but nothing to write home about. The nachos were impressive! Thin tortilla chips, incredibly tasty white cheese product, jalapenos, pico, and ground beef. The beer selection was decent, a couple craft beers along with the usual. We also got a cookie and ice cream dessert: 6 warm chocolate chip cookies, with one scoop vanilla ice cream.

Came here for brunch on a beautiful Sunday. Their patio is lovely, plants abloom, giving you a feeling of privacy even while others are right next to you.   My entree, the matador, was incredible! The potatoes under the egg/ tortillas were my favorite, and the sauce they used was tangy and unique. My friend got the omelet and said it was also delicious. The wonderful drink specials definitely don't hurt ($5 mimosas, bloodies, cocktails, pitchers of beer, etc.)  I can't wait to come back!

I was excited to come here for a salad after a great work out. I ordered an $8 vegetarian greek salad. Now, when I order an $8 salad of any kind, I expect it to be hefty. Especially when it is vegetarian. A salad of that price needs to have lots of feta, cucs, peppers, olives, onions, etc etc.   This salad was mostly lettuce. It had many diced onions, about 4 olives, 3 cucs, 3 halved cherry tomatoes, 1 (count em, ONE) green pepper slice, and some feta. It was served with a side of oil. WHAT?! I paid eight dollars for this sad excuse for a salad.   I was a bit pleasantly surprised to find some potato salad under the bed of lettuce, but how is that even part of a greek salad? So confused.  I won't be back to this or any other Zoe's Kitchen anytime soon...

Came here on a Sunday for lunch, and sat on the covered patio. I got a red sangria ($5 for happy hour) and the express lunch deal. For $10.95, I got a 10" artichoke pizza and a half veggie salad. I was really impressed with the salad! It had shredded lettuce, cherry tomatoes, avocado, some delicious cheese chunks, white beans, and probably more that I am forgetting. The pizza was excellent! It was white style with both black and green olives, caramelized onions, and artichoke. The crust was soft and tasty. This was enough to fill me up and I had some left overs. My only complaint is that service was a bit slow...

I came here for take out food around 7pm on a Friday night. There was a line, but it moved pretty quickly. The concept was really interesting! You start by choosing between a salad, a burrito, tacos, or bowls (apparently a bowl is a burrito without a tortilla- for the healthy folks). You go on choose what kind of rice, beans, meat, and toppings you want. Be careful because if you say "a little," it seems that they still give you a full serving, maybe even a bit more than a full serving. Fascinating concept, I'll have to come back and try something different!

This was a cool dive bar with a speakeasy feel. The bar has a bit of a classy air to it, while the back room is filled with games and some oddities (think chairs with animal fur cushions and barrel tables). They have sour beer bombers for $10... That's a steal in my book!

Soooo the problem that I thought I had was bed bugs (I told her I was new to town and staying at someone's home on their furniture). She told me right away "those don't look like bedbug bites, they look like hives." Well guess what... They were definitely bed bugs. Wish I could go ask for my money back, but I guess healthcare doesn't work that way.

I thought The Yard was really cool! It has a unique atmosphere, and is open to air. I came for happy hour on a Thursday, all 12oz draughts are $3. Well also had the pretzel bites with cheese fondue. Easily enough for two to share. Lots of delicious, delicious carbs. We met some people while playing cornhole. Everyone seemed to be having fun.

My expectations were not quite met with my experience at Salut. I hate rating anything a 2 or 1, but I can't bring myself to give it a 3. I wish I could give it a 2.5! My $13 bruschetta certainly was not bad. The toppings were actually quite delicious, but the bread tasted as though they picked it up from Fry's a few days ago. Pictured here are the fig, apple, wild mushroom, and pesto options, with a couple pieces missing ;). My white wine was served at room temp, which I was not thrilled about, but it was still drinkable. The service was below average, although our server was nice. All in all, I've experienced better. But I'd come back and give it a second shot if a friend suggested it- I just wouldn't do the suggesting.

Holy crap! I can't wait to come back here! I came at midnight on a Friday and there was a line out the door. I came close to leaving when I saw the line, but man am I happy I stuck around. Such a neat bar! There are a couple different rooms, one has endless pinball, ski ball, and some other arcade games. Another room has this creepy yet cool atmosphere due to the back shadow lighting of hanging objects above the bar. I didn't stick around long because I was quite tired, but I promised myself I'd be back!

Yay! A new brewery in Phoenix! I had a flight of the only four beers they have at the moment. They were all great, but I'd say the IPA was easily my favorite. They have coffee on tap, which is unique.  Small growlers for $10 and a flight for $6- not bad. The thing I really liked about this brewery is that there is no TV and no music playing, yet conversation was enough to give the atmosphere a fun personality. I really enjoyed my visit here!

Definitely a positive brunch experience! Huevos rancheros were savory and full-flavored, but not a huge portion (which I prefer). The mimosa bar exceeded my expectations- it had orange juice and/or strawberry juice for mixing, as well as raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, and blue berries to add an elegant feel to your mimosa! The dining area was open and uncluttered and the exposed brick allowed for a modern, yet rustic atmosphere.
