Local First!!!  I is small but there is always a few local neighborhood regulars there and is becoming quite the gathering place for those that live in the area...

I have to say that our recent trip  overall was a pleasant.  My only complaint would be with the host staff.  We had made a reservation with open-table.com and shortly after Leaving we received a No Show email from open table.  I assume that the Hostess did not know how to check someone in that had a reservation.  While this was eventually resolved I did take several calls and emails to do so and they only way it was closed was for us to provide a copy of the receipt to open table to verify that were had arrived for our reservation.  While the service, food, and beverages were fantastic the attention to detail needs just a bit of polishing.

What ever happen to customer service?  It seems that this term and banking (at least with Chase) are not allowed to exist within their walls  I had a deposit eaten by the ATM on Sunday march 4 and today Tuesday the Acting manager and CSR told me they only count the machine once a week on Thursdays. Kinda makes you scratch your head and go hummmm What else can I say?

You can not beat the Personalized service and the care our animals receive at this location  Our pups are treated like the Privileged pooches that they really are.  Thanks for being part of the family!

First time here and I will try to remember it is a sports bar and it is a bit close to the burbs for us but "Groupon" reeled us in.   Just ordered apps (rings and fingers). Atmosphere is definitely sports bar flat screens everywhere.  Live band the night we were there (Fri Aug 19). 15 minutes for appetizers they better be good...  Such a let down.

Happy hour till 7.  $6 specialty drinks (recommend raspberry and roses) and $3 to $5 Sushi rolls special featured item: Recovery roll $12 (probably one of the best rolls I have ever had anywhere) with proceeds to support Japanese people  recover from the catastrophe and the thousands of people that remain homeless.  Great service, food, and drink. Dont forget 2 hour free parking just have your token validated by your server.

Dennis and crew deserve a standing ovation for their speedy and precise work. They go out of their way when need alterations or even a new suit. They truly are the best.  Way to go Dennis. You have a customer for life.

Great people very professional and caring.  Sometimes it helps to talk to someone and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes just talking an issue through you are able to discover the answer or solution yourself.

Decided to try out this one for breakfast with some out of town guest.  Hummmmm...  Definitely overpriced!!!  A two egg breakfast was $20 ... Four for breakfast was $80 and one in my party did not even eat we shared a fruit plate... Definitely not worth the money and since we were the only table in the dining room you would have expected the service staff to be falling over each other to wait on our table... NOT.  Don't think i will be returning and will not recommend to anyone else... Good Luck!

Service is good but the food was absolutely horrible do not get the bananas foster it's pure brown sugar with bananas.  It is so grotesquely sweet that you can't even eat good luck!
