Sad. This used to be one of my favorite places. When we went to the new grand opening of Richardson's we were all so excited, but that soon faded with the horrible service, cramped eating areas, and food with no flavor other than hash or ancho chilies. I love chilies and I know that new mexican cuisine incorporates this ingredient a lot but that is all we tasted in all 4 of our different dishes. The cooks need to learn about portion control and tasting before serving. Very disappointed.

This place is great. They have excellent service, clean waiting rooms (sick and healthy), and the Doctors the time to talk to you and don't rush you out. Dr. Kleiner is our pediatrician and he is very kind, insightful, and patient. I strongly recommend him. Pediatrix has a couple of locations in the North Valley. Each location has different hours to accommodate those at many hours of the day, including the weekend.

This bar is old, run down, beat up, and just plain awesome! Think "Cheers." The people here are extremely friendly. Everyone treats you like family. This is a place you could go to solo and yet you won't be alone. The food selection is amazing for bar food but the kitchen is not always open. The alcohol is low cost and if you play your cards right a "regular" might even show you the trick on how to get the quarter in the shot glass t the bottom of the fish tank to win a beer. (It took me one try.)   The downside is that this is a membership bar. You will either need to be military, former military, or an invitee of a member to go inside. Expect to pay about $60 a year to maintain membership.

One of my favorite thai restaurants! Great food! Not a lot of money. Service is okay. The seating is aweful. Get there before the croud. Bottom line is that the food is amazing and its worth the trip.

I must say after watching so many positive episodes of Guys Big Bite on the Food Network I started to question him as a legitimate food reviewer; however, after trying Chino BandidoI must say... Guy got this one spot on! The jerk rice and black beans were well balanced with their spices and sweetness. The carnitas and jade red chicken were both out of this world delicious. Their desserts, volcano or snicker-doodle cookies, were soft, fresh, and full of their sweet flavor. The staff was superior to the norm. And their dining room, although nothing special, has the "hole in the wall" feel that most of us look for in a non corporate restaurant. This is definitely a place i will be returning to.

Ugh. Never again. This is by far the WORST Chinese food I have EVER had. Trust me on this one! STAY AWAY!

This place is great. Think fast food Italian style but everything is made fresh. The ingredients are wonderful and their wine is delicious too (especially for the price). For around $20 two people can enjoy a pizza and two glasses of wine.   I recommend this place to those that are in the mood for good Italian food but don't feel like the typical delivered pie or the expense of some other sit down Italian restaurants.

My wife and I looked forward to eating here for weeks. We decided to get one of our favorites tonight, bbq pork ribs. Let me say... extremely disapointed! Neither one of us would recommend this place.

This haunted house is awesome. The first house in the 13th floor was a great experience, the second house called Zombieland wasn't so much fun. The total experience last about 45 minutes which is well worth the money spent. Some people were complaining about having to crawl in Zombieland but there is an option to go around the crawlspace. I would have to agree with others that management does allow too many people to walk through the haunted house at the same time which causes the people in the front of the line to get the initial shock and the people towards the rear of the line to anticipate what's around the corner. The set pieces are outstanding and the special effects are great as well. I would strongly recommend going to this haunted house over others in the valley like Scream Park and Jack and Jill's haunted Hill.

This house reminds me of the movie saw. It's not scary. It's more of a psycological thriller. The sales person said it would take 12 to 15 minutes to get through and we were through it in less than five. I would not recommend going to this production, instead go to the 13th floor off of Bell Road and I 17.

This hole in the wall cafe might be easily passed up (due to visibility) but it shouldn't be. Authentic Detroit chips, soda, and coney dogs. I have had better coney dogs but these ones are pretty legit. The staff is also extremely friendly and provide great customer service.

Never again. This was a one time thing. Let me first start by saying the service was great, not flawless as we had to ask for drinks a couple of times before a refill arrived, but the staff was professional and nice. On the flip side of things their burgers were nothing special. I honestly would rather eat at McDonalds over this place. I had the Blu Burger and I was not impressed. Their beer selection is good and their French fry selection was decent too. I would only recommend going here if you are looking to eat quick (because the place is EMPTY) and are craving beer and fries.

Extremely friendly service. I received an oil change and a car wash. They didn't try to up-sell me with the oil change and the attendants (both the cashier and the car washers) were very helpful and nice.
