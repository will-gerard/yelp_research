I eat at chipotle 2-3 times a week. This is definitely the worst I've ever been to. The place was filthy and the staff was horrible.

Great place. The food was good. The prices were reasonable, and the service was great. It's a great neighborhood joint.

I like the atmosphere a lot but the food needed a lot of work. I realize it's difficult to serve fresh bbq sometimes, but the brisket was dry and so tough you needed a knife to cut it. The pork was a out the same. For the price and quality of food its a tough sell.

This place has the best burger ever, wings are awesome, and an amazing selection beers.  One of my favorite spots in phoenix.

If you're looking for some super trendy atmosphere with average to below average food, this is the place for you. The chips and guacamole were horrible. The fish tacos were dry.
