Was going here for over three years and kept going through several doctors as they kept leaving the practice themselves to go elsewhere. The last straw was when I got a bill for something I had treated there many times before, my insurance claimed they billed it wrong, which they wouldn't correct, so after months of fighting with them, over a year to be exact, I ended up paying the bill. When I decided to leave, it took them months to transfer my records to my new doctor. Unfortunately my doctor left his practice to start his own but won't be up and running for a few months, so I called to make an appointment and they told me I couldn't return, that they would not take me back. How is that for service after over three years of business?

I bought a new car yesterday, it currently has 55 miles on it. Went to brunch this morning with a few friends and afterwards they came out and looked at it and looked over it with me as i wanted a few pairs of eyes to go over it because this coming week i am taking it back to the dealership to have whatever is wrong on the body repaired, which at the time there was only ONE thing, which had been documented by myself, and the dealership. I go to get it washed for the hell of it, and came out of the tunnel and pulled up to dry it off and noticed TWO huge gouges out of the passenger sides door panel molding which i know was not there 5mins before. I immediately called over the manager who said there was no way that it could have been done by the car wash because it didn't match the brush patter and it wasn't going side to side but up and down, even though one of them was. Even if something got stuck in one of the brushes it couldn't have been the car wash. There is no way between the 5mins i went from brunch to the car wash i got two chunks taken out of my car that i have had for less than 24hrs, let alone two different scratches caused by two different things. I have been a customer of yours for over 4 years and have never had an issue and the one time i do, your company does not accept any responsibility and is of no help whatsoever. Do not use them, they're terrible.
