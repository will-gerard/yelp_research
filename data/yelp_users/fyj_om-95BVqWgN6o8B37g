Food is decent. Second time I ordered to go and they didn't put any utensils in the bag. If you're going to put napkins in there than you should at least add spoons or forks.

Good atmosphere. You can have a beer while you wait.  Only place I go to now.

I've called numerous times and they never pick up their phone. I'd be nice since people like to order to go often.
